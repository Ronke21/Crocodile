<text>Mick Goodrick (June 9, 1945 – November 16, 2022) was an American jazz guitarist who spent most of his career as a teacher. In the early 1970s, he worked with Gary Burton and Pat Metheny.

==Biography==
An Elvis fan, Goodrick began studying guitar in his pre-teens and was performing professionally a few years later. When he was sixteen, he became interested in jazz at a Stan Kenton Band Camp. He attended the Berklee School of Music from 1963 to 1967. He taught at Berklee, then spent a few years touring with Gary Burton. After returning to Boston, he settled into a career largely as an educator.

Goodrick has had many notable students, including Bill Frisell, Julian Lage, John Scofield, Lage Lund, Mike Stern, Avner Strauss, and Rale Micic. His first book, &quot;The Advancing Guitarist,&quot; is an instruction manual for guitarists of all styles. He has also written a series of books addressing the intricacies of harmonic voice leading.

Goodrick worked with Charlie Haden&#x27;s Liberation Music Orchestra during the 1980s and early 1990s, with Jack DeJohnette in the late 1980s, and with Steve Swallow in the late 1990s. He performed in a duo with Pat Metheny at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2005 and with Wolfgang Muthspiel at the Jazz Standard in 2008.

Goodrick died from the long-term effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on November 16, 2022, at the age of 77.

<doc id="433695" wikidata="Q1465079" url="?curid=433695" title="Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners">
<text>The Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Afrikaans for &quot;Society of True Afrikaners&quot;) was formed on 14 August 1875 in the town of Paarl by a group of Afrikaans speakers from the current Western Cape region. From 15 January 1876 the society published a journal in Afrikaans called &quot;Die Afrikaanse Patriot&quot; (&quot;The Afrikaans Patriot&quot;) as well as a number of books, including grammars, dictionaries, religious material and histories. &quot;Die Afrikaanse Patriot&quot; was succeeded in 1905 by today&#x27;s Paarl newspaper.

Arnoldus Pannevis, a teacher, is generally considered to be the spiritual father of the society. He had observed that most of the South Africans from Dutch descent could not speak the &quot;pure&quot; form of their original mother tongue anymore. In the course of its (then) 200-year-old history, the language of the immigrants from the Netherlands had been thoroughly changed by the influence of other European immigrants, indigenous tribes such as the Khoikhoi, and especially the Cape Malays. In 1874 Pannevis expressed these views in the journal &quot;de Zuid-Afrikaan&quot; under the title &quot;Is die Afferkaans wesenlijk een taal?&quot;

The eight founding members were Gideon Malherbe, the Dutch immigrant CP Hoogenhout, DF du ToitAF (nicknamed &quot;Dokter&quot;, i.e. &quot;Doctor&quot;), a journalist coincidentally named Daniel Francois du ToitAF (nicknamed &quot;Oom Lokomotief&quot;, i.e. &quot;Uncle Locomotive&quot;), his brother Rev SJ du Toit, August Ahrbeck, Petrus Malherbe and SG du Toit. Everybody except Hoogenhout and Ahrbeck were related. Many of them were of Huguenot descent.

On 14 August 1975 the &quot;Afrikaans Language Museum&quot; was opened in the former house of Gideon Malherbe in Paarl, the building in which the Society was founded. The Afrikaans Language Monument was also opened in Paarl in 1975, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Society.

<text>William Hopkins FRS (2 February 179313 October 1866) was an English mathematician and geologist. He is famous as a private tutor of aspiring undergraduate Cambridge mathematicians, earning him the &quot;sobriquet&quot; the &quot;senior-wrangler maker.&quot;

He also made important contributions in asserting a solid, rather than fluid, interior for the Earth and explaining many geological phenomena in terms of his model. However, though his conclusions proved to be correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning were subsequently seen as unsound.

==Early life==
Hopkins was born at Kingston-on-Soar, in Nottinghamshire, the only son of William Hopkins, a gentleman farmer. In his youth he learned practical agriculture in Norfolk before his father rented him a small farm at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. However, Hopkins was unsuccessful as a farmer and, when his first wife died sometime around 1821, he took the opportunity to mitigate his losses and enter St Peter&#x27;s College (now Peterhouse) at the University of Cambridge, taking his degree of B.A. in 1827 as seventh wrangler and M.A. in 1830.

==Wrangler maker==
Before graduation, Hopkins had married Caroline Frances Boys (1799–1881) and was, therefore, ineligible for a fellowship. He instead maintained himself as a private tutor, coaching the young mathematicians who sought the prestigious distinction of Senior Wrangler. He was enormously successful in the role, earning the &quot;sobriquet&quot; senior wrangler maker and grossing £700–800 annually. By 1849, he had coached almost 200 wranglers, of whom 17 were senior wranglers including Arthur Cayley and G. G. Stokes. Among his more famous pupils were Lord Kelvin, James Clerk Maxwell and Isaac Todhunter. Francis Galton praised his teaching style:

He also coached Edward Routh who went on to be Senior Wrangler and himself a prodigious &quot;wrangler maker&quot;. In 1833, Hopkins published &quot;Elements of Trigonometry&quot; and became distinguished for his mathematical knowledge.

There was a famous story that the theory of George Green (1793–1841) was almost forgotten. In 1845, Lord Kelvin (William Thomson, a young man in 1845) got some copies of Green&#x27;s 1828 short book from William Hopkins. Subsequently, Lord Kelvin helped to make Green&#x27;s 1828 work famous.

==Geology==
About 1833, through meeting Adam Sedgwick at Barmouth and joining him in several excursions, Hopkins became intensely interested in geology. From then on, in papers published by the Cambridge Philosophical Society and the Geological Society of London, he defined the discipline of physical geology, making mathematical investigations dealing with the effects that an elevatory force, acting from below, would produce on a portion of the Earth&#x27;s crust, in fissures and faults. In this way he discussed the elevation and denudation of the Lake District, the Wealden area, and the Bas Boulonnais.

Hopkins conceived of a largely solid but dynamic Earth threaded with cavities whereby hot vapours or fluids could create locally elevatory pressures. Such a model was at odds with the ideas of Charles Lyell whose theory was of a &quot;steady state&quot; with a largely liquid terrestrial interior, inside a solid crust no more than 100 miles thick. Hopkins presented a series of papers at the Royal Society between 1838 and 1842 analysing the Earth&#x27;s rotation, including its precession and nutation, and using observations to support his theory, contending that they were inconsistent with a fluid interior. He also interpreted earthquakes and volcanoes through the same model in an 1847 British Association report.

As part of his investigations, Hopkins sought to quantify the effects of enormous pressures on the melting point and thermal conductivity of various substances. With the support of a grant from the Royal Society, he invoked the assistance of Thomson, James Prescott Joule and William Fairbairn to make measurements which he interpreted as supporting his theory. He further asserted that the cooling of the Earth had had no real impact on climate. He read a paper to the Geological Society &quot;On the Causes which may have produced changes in the Earth&#x27;s superficial Temperature&quot; (1851). In his second address as president of the Geological Society of London (1853) he criticised Elie de Beaumont&#x27;s theory of the elevation of mountain-chains and the imperfect evidence on which he saw it as resting.

Ultimately, it was Thomson who tactfully pointed out that, though Hopkins&#x27;s conclusions about the Earth&#x27;s structure were correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning was unsound.

==Glaciology==
Hopkins wrote also on the motion of glaciers and the transport of glacial erratics but trespassed on the sensitivities of J. D. Forbes who saw the subject as his personal fiefdom and was contemptuous of Hopkins&#x27;s lack of observational experience in the subject.

==Private life==
Hopkins enjoyed music, poetry and landscape painting. He spent the end of his life in a lunatic asylum in Stoke Newington. He died there of chronic mania and exhaustion.

He had, with his second wife, one son and three daughters, among them morality campaigner Ellice Hopkins.

He played first-class cricket from 1825 to 1828. He was mainly associated with Cambridge University Cricket Club and made 4 known appearances in first-class matches.

<text>Clarence Irving Lewis (April 12, 1883 – February 3, 1964) was an American academic philosopher. He is considered the progenitor of modern modal logic and the founder of conceptual pragmatism. First a noted logician, he later branched into epistemology, and during the last 20 years of his life, he wrote much on ethics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; memorialized him as &quot;a leading authority on symbolic logic and on the philosophic concepts of knowledge and value.&quot; He coined the term &quot;Qualia&quot; as used in philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive sciences.

==Biography==

Lewis was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts. His father was a skilled worker in a shoe factory, and Lewis grew up in relatively humble circumstances. He discovered philosophy at age 13, when reading about the Greek pre-Socratics, Anaxagoras and Heraclitus in particular. The first work of philosophy Lewis recalled studying was &quot;A Short History of Greek Philosophy&quot; by John Marshall (1891). Immanuel Kant proved a major lifelong influence on Lewis&#x27;s thinking. In his article &quot;Logic and Pragmatism&quot;, Lewis wrote: &quot;Nothing comparable in importance happened [in my life] until I became acquainted with Kant... Kant compelled me. He had, so I felt, followed scepticism to its inevitable last stage, and laid the foundations where they could not be disturbed.&quot;

In 1902, he entered Harvard University. Since his parents were not able to help him financially, he had to work as a waiter to earn his tuition. In 1905, Harvard College awarded Lewis the Bachelor of Arts &quot;cum laude&quot; after a mere three years of study, during which time he supported himself with part-time jobs. He then taught English for one year in a high school in Quincy, Massachusetts, then two years at the University of Colorado. In 1906, he married Mable Maxwell Graves.

In 1908, Lewis returned to Harvard and began a Ph.D. in philosophy, which he completed in a mere two years. He then taught philosophy at the University of California, 1911–20, after which he returned again to Harvard&#x27;s philosophy department, where he taught until his 1953 retirement, eventually filling the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy. His Harvard course on Kant&#x27;s first &quot;Critique&quot; was among the most famous in undergraduate philosophy in the U.S. until he retired.

Lewis&#x27;s life was not free of trials. His daughter died in October 1932 and he had a heart attack in 1933. Nevertheless, the publications of Lewis (1929) and Lewis and Langford (1932) attest to these years having been a highly productive period of his life. During this same period, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929, and in 1933, he presided over the American Philosophical Association. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1942.

Lewis accepted a visiting professorship at Stanford during 1957–58, where he presented his lectures for the last time. For the academic year 1959–60, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.

==Philosophical work==

===Logic===
Lewis studied logic under his eventual Ph.D. thesis supervisor, Josiah Royce, and is a principal architect of modern philosophical logic. In 1912, two years after the publication of the first volume of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Lewis began publishing articles taking exception to 
&quot;Principia&#x27; &quot;s pervasive use of material implication, more specifically, to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s reading of &quot;a&quot;→&quot;b&quot; as &quot;&quot;a&quot; implies &quot;b&quot;.&quot; Lewis restated this criticism in his reviews of both editions of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s reputation as a promising young logician was soon assured.

Material implication (the rule of inference which claims that stating &quot;P implies Q&quot; is equivalent to stating &quot;Q OR not P&quot;) allows a true consequent to follow from a false antecedent (so if P is not true still Q may be true since you only stated what a true P implies, but did not state what is implied if P is untrue).

Lewis proposed to replace the usage of material implication during discussions involving logic with the term strict implication, by which a (contingently) false antecedent, which is false but could have been true, does not always strictly imply a (contingently) true consequent, which is true but could have been false. The same logical result is implied, but in a clearer and more explicit way. Stating strictly that P implies Q is explicitly not stating what the untrue P implies. And therefore if P is not true, Q may be true, but may be false as well.

As opposed to material implication, in strict implication the statement is not primitive - it is not defined in positive terms, but rather in the combined terms of negation, conjunction, and a prefixed unary intensional modal operator, formula_1. The following is its formal definition: 
::If &quot;X&quot; is a formula with a classical bivalent truth value
::(which must be either true or false), 
::then formula_1&quot;X&quot; can be read as &quot;&quot;X&quot; is possibly true&quot;.

Lewis then defined &quot;&quot;A&quot; strictly implies &quot;B&quot;&quot; as &quot;formula_3(&quot;A&quot;formula_4&quot;B&quot;)&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s strict implication is now a historical curiosity, but the formal modal logic in which he grounded that notion is the ancestor of all modern work on the subject. Lewis&#x27; formula_1 notation is still standard, but current practice usually takes its dual, the square notation formula_6, meaning &quot;necessity&quot;, which is stating a primitive notion, while the diamond notation, formula_1, is left as a defined (derived) meaning. With square notation &quot;&quot;A&quot; strictly implies &quot;B&quot;&quot; is simply written as formula_6(&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;), which states explicitly that we are only implying the truth of B when A is true, and we are not implying anything about when B can be false, nor what A implies if it is false, in which case B can be false or B can just as well be true.

His first published monograph about advances in logic since the time of Leibniz, &quot;A Survey of Symbolic Logic&quot; (1918), culminating a series of articles written since 1900, went out of print after selling several hundred copies. At the time of its publication, it included the only discussion in English of the logical writings of Charles Sanders Peirce. This book followed Russell&#x27;s 1900 monograph on Leibnitz, and in later editions he removed a section that seemed similar to it.

Lewis went on to devise modal logic which he described in his next book &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; (1932) as possible formal analyses of the alethic modalities, modes of logical truth such as necessity, possibility and impossibility.

Several amended versions of his first book &quot;A Survey of Symbolic Logic&quot; have been written over the years, designated as S1 to S5, the last two, S4 and S5, generated much mathematical and philosophical interest, sustained to the present day and are the beginnings of what became the field of normal modal logic.

===Pragmatist but no positivist===
Around 1930, with the introduction of logical empiricism to America by German and Austrian philosophers fleeing Europe under Nazi Germany, American philosophy went through a turning point.

This new doctrine, with its emphasis on scientific models of knowledge and on the logical analysis of meaning, soon became dominant, challenging American philosophers such as Lewis who held a naturalistic or pragmatic approach.

Lewis was perceived as a logical empiricist, but actually differed with it on some major points, rejecting logical positivism, which is the notion that all genuine knowledge is derived solely from sensory experience as interpreted through reason and logic, and rejecting physicalism with its notion that the mind along with its experience is actually equivalent to physical entities such as the brain and the body. He held that experience should be analyzed separately, and that semiotic value does have cognitive significance.

Reflecting on the differences between pragmatism and positivism, Lewis devised the notion of cognitive structure, concluding that any significant knowledge must come from experience. Semiotic value, accordingly, is the way of representing this knowledge, which is stored for deciding future conduct.

Charles Sanders Peirce the founder of pragmaticism saw the world as a system of signs. Therefore, scientific research was a branch of semiotics, primarily needing to be analyzed and justified in semiotic terms, before actually conducting any kind of experiment, and the meaning of meaning must be understood before anything else could be &quot;explained&quot;. This included analyzing and studying what experience itself is.
In &quot;Mind and the World Order&quot; (1929) Lewis explained that Peirce&#x27;s &quot;pragmatic test&quot; of significance should be understood with Peirce&#x27;s own limitation which prescribed meaning only to what makes a verfiable difference in experience although experience is subjective.

A year later, in &quot;Pragmatism and Current Thought&quot; (1930) he repeated this but emphasized the subjectiveness of experience. Concepts, according to Lewis&#x27; explanation of Peirce, are abstractions in which the experience is to be considered, rather than any &quot;factual&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot; truth.

The validation of the perceived experiences are achieved by doing comparison tests. For example, if one person perceives time or weight as double that of the other&#x27;s perception, the two perceptions are never truly comparable. Thus a concept is a relational pattern.

Still, by checking the physical attributes which each of the two people assign to their experiences, in this case the weight and time in physical units, it is possible to analyze some part of the experience, and one should not discard that very important aspect of the world as it is experienced.

Thus knowledge begins and ends in experience, keeping in mind that the beginning and ending experiences differ.

Furthermore, according to Lewis&#x27; interpretation of Peirce, knowledge of something requires that the verifying experience itself be actually experienced as well.

Thus, for the pragmatist, verifiability as an operational definition (or test) of the empirical meaning of a statement requires that the speaker know how to apply that statement, when not to apply it, and that the speaker will be able to trace the consequences of the statement in situations both real and hypothetical.

Lewis firmly objected to the positivist interpretation of value statements as being merely &quot;expressive&quot;, devoid of any cognitive content.

In his 1946 essay &quot;Logical Positivism and Pragmatism&quot; Lewis set out both his concept of sense meaning, and his thesis that valuation is a form of empirical cognition. He disagreed with verificationism, and preferred the term empirical meaning. Claiming that pragmatism and logical positivism are forms of empiricism.

Lewis argued that there is a deep difference between the seemingly similar concepts of pragmatic meaning and the logical-positivist requirement of verification.

According to Lewis, pragmatism ultimately bases its understanding of meaning on conceivable experience, while positivism reduces the relation between meaning and experience to a matter of logical form. Thus, according to Lewis, the positivist view precisely omits the necessary empirical meaning as it would be called by the pragmatist.

Specifying which observational statements follow from a given sentence, helps us determine the empirical meaning of the given sentence only if the observation statements themselves have an already understood meaning in terms of the experience which the observation statements refer to.

According to Lewis, the logical positivists failed to distinguish between &quot;linguistic&quot; meaning - the logical relations among terms, and &quot;empirical&quot; meaning - the relation that expressions must experience. (In Carnap and Charles W. Morris&#x27; terminology, empirical meaning falls under pragmatics, while linguistic meaning under semantics.) Lewis argues against the logical positivist who shut their eyes to precisely that which properly confirms a sentence, namely the content of experience.

===Epistemology===

Lewis (1929), &quot;Mind and the World Order&quot;, is now seen as one of the most important 20th century works in epistemology. Since 2005, following Murray Murphey&#x27;s book about Lewis and pragmatism, Lewis has been included among the American pragmatists.
Lewis was an early exponent of coherentism, particularly as supported by probability observations such as those advocated by Thomas Bayes.

He was the first to employ the term &quot;qualia&quot;, popularized by his doctoral student Nelson Goodman, in its generally agreed modern sense.

For Lewis, the mind&#x27;s grasp of different possible worlds is mediated by facts. Lewis defines a fact as “that which a proposition (some actual or possible proposition) denotes or asserts.” For Lewis, facts, as opposed to objects, are the units of our knowledge, and facts are able to enter into inferential relationships with other facts such that one fact may imply or exclude another. Facts relate to each other such that they can form systems that describe possible worlds, but the facts themselves have the same logical relationships whether a world is actual or not. He says, “... the logical relations of facts are unaltered by their actuality or non-actuality, just as the logical relations of propositions are unaffected by their truth or falsity.”

===Ethics and aesthetics===
Lewis&#x27;s late writings on ethics include the monographs Lewis (1955, 1957) and the posthumous collection Lewis (1969). From 1946 until his death, he wrote many drafts of chapters of a proposed treatise on ethics, which he did not live to complete. These drafts are included in the Lewis papers held at Stanford University.

Lewis (1947) contains two chapters on aesthetics and the philosophy of art.

===Legacy===
Lewis&#x27;s work has been relatively neglected in recent years, even though he set out his ideas at length. He can be understood as both a late pragmatist and an early analytic philosopher, and had students of the calibre of Brand Blanshard, Nelson Goodman, and Roderick Chisholm. Joel Isaac believes this neglect is justified.

Ten lectures and short articles that Lewis produced in the 1950s were collected and edited by John Lange in 1969. The collection, &quot;Values and Imperatives: Studies in Ethics&quot;, was published by Stanford University Press.

Lewis&#x27;s reputation benefits from interest in his contributions to symbolic logic, binary relations, modal logic and the development of pragmatism in American philosophy.

There are 11.5 linear feet of Lewis&#x27;s papers at Stanford University Libraries.

<text>James Phillip Hoffa (born May 19, 1941), also known as James Hoffa Jr. or Jim Hoffa, is an American labor leader and attorney who was the tenth General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He is the son of Jimmy Hoffa. Hoffa was first elected in 1998, and re-elected in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 to five-year terms. In 2018, Hoffa was elected chair of the Road Transport Section of the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation at its quadrennial Congress in Singapore. Hoffa is the second-longest serving General President of the Teamsters Union, after Dan Tobin, who served from 1907 to 1952. Hoffa&#x27;s final term as General President ended in 2022.

==Personal life==

Hoffa is the son of Jimmy Hoffa, who served as General President of the Teamsters from 1957 to 1971, and Josephine (&quot;née&quot; Poszywak) Hoffa. He has one sister, Judge Barbara Ann Crancer. Hoffa is married to Virginia &quot;Ginger&quot; Sue Harris (b. 1945), a former teacher and licensed veterinary technician since 1969. They have two sons, David (b. 1970) and Geoffrey (b. 1972), and six grandchildren.

Born in Detroit, Michigan on May 19, 1941, Hoffa attended Cooley High School. There, he became a member of the National Honor Society, and an all-city and all-state football player. During the summer months, the Hoffa family visited their cottage in rural Orion Township outside Detroit.

Hoffa often accompanied his father to Teamster meetings and events, and became a Teamster in 1959 on his 18th birthday. Hoffa holds a degree in economics from Michigan State University (1963) and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Michigan Law School (1966). Hoffa was awarded a Ford Foundation Fellowship to work in the Michigan State Senate as an aide to senate and house members doing constituent relations and research. Hoffa is a member of Alpha Tau Omega. He was an attorney for the Teamsters from 1968 to 1993.

==Teamsters activity==

===2021 Election of International Union Officers===
Following 23 years as the leader of the union, Hoffa announced his intent to retire at the end of his term and backed the Vairma-Herrera Teamsters Power Slate. In November 2021, the O&#x27;Brien-Zuckerman Teamsters United Slate beat the Hoffa-backed slate by a more than two-to-one margin. O&#x27;Brien and his slate were sworn into office on March 22, 2022, at Teamsters headquarters in Washington, D.C. On the day his administration was installed, O&#x27;Brien fired more than 80 employees at the headquarters. He did not offer any severance or extension of benefits to the terminated staff. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters currently faces charges with the National Labor Relations Board in connection the terminations. As of November 10, 2022, the union was required to pay eligible terminated employees more than $175,000 as part of a settlement with the District of Columbia Attorney General&#x27;s Office for violating D.C. Code 32-1303. 

===2021 Pension Reform===
Hoffa led Teamster efforts to protect defined-benefit pension plans for more than a decade following the economic collapse of 2008. The legislation championed by Hoffa and the Teamsters was known as the Butch Lewis Act, named after a Teamster retiree pension activist, and became law as part of President Biden&#x27;s American Rescue Plan stimulus package in 2021. As part of the ARP, more than 50 Teamster pension plans – including its largest, the Central States Pension Fund – are eligible for assistance at the outset of the bill&#x27;s enactment, with more of the union&#x27;s plans becoming eligible in 2022. Under the new law, money to assist eligible plans will come directly from the U.S. Treasury Department in the form of grants which would not need to be repaid. Plan participants will receive 100 percent of their earned pension benefits.

===Appointments===
(2019 – Present) Chair, Road Section, International Transport Workers Federation; (2019 – Present) Member, Executive Board, International Transport Workers Federation; (2015 – Present) Board Member, Roosevelt Institute; (2010 – Present) USTR Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations; (2009 – Present) Department of Labor Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy; (2013 – 2015) National Freight Advisory Committee; (2002 – 2004) President&#x27;s Council on the 21st Century Workforce; (2002 – 2004) Secretary of Energy&#x27;s Advisory Board

===Legislative activities during tenure===
Hoffa earned a reputation as an advocate for fair trade and worker safety. He transformed the Teamsters into a premier political force by changing alliances
and rhetoric unpredictably.

Under his leadership, the Teamsters ended a federal program that allowed Mexican truckers to haul goods beyond the border zone in the United States. The Teamsters strongly opposed a trade deal with Colombia through lobbying and street protests, and were credited with helping to prevent a similar trade deal with Panama.

The Teamsters successfully encouraged Congress to pass legislation increasing rail security in 2007.

The Teamsters sued the Bush administration in 2005 to overturn regulations that extended the number of hours a driver could spend behind the wheel of a truck. The Teamsters argued the rule would contribute to driver fatigue. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with the Teamsters, but it was the Obama administration that finally agreed to change the rule.

Under his leadership, the Teamsters ended a federal program in 2009 that allowed Mexican truckers to haul goods beyond the border zone in the United States. Hoffa predicted the failure of a second version of the program in October 2011, and challenged it in federal court.

===George Washington University===
In 2008, Hoffa established the Teamsters Labor History Research Center and the Teamsters archives at the George Washington University Gelman Library in Washington, D.C. 
Hoffa was awarded the university&#x27;s President&#x27;s Medal in 2014. &quot;George Washington is proud to honor Jim Hoffa as a passionate advocate for social justice and the labor movement, as one of the foremost experts on labor issues, and also as a dedicated partner and friend of this university,&quot; said Steven Knapp, GW President.

===1996 campaign===
Hoffa campaigned against the Teamsters incumbent president, Ron Carey, at the Teamsters international convention of June 1996 in Philadelphia. After nearly 500,000 votes were cast in early November 1996, Ron Carey had won the election with 52 percent of the vote. At the time Carey characterized the victory as one for &quot;reformers in the American labor movement.&quot;

Five months later, in April 1997, news broke that a federal grand jury was investigating Hoffa led allegations that Ron Carey had received illegal campaign kickbacks and employer contributions during the Teamsters election the previous year. The union has been supervised by a court-appointed administrator ever since a consent decree with the Justice Department in 1989.

A new election for Teamsters president was ordered by the federal government in August 1997, after federal official Barbara Zack Quindel&#x27;s investigation uncovered a &quot;complex network of schemes&quot; that involved the improper use of Teamster assets.

Quindel found that the Carey campaign had received more than $220,000 in illegal contributions. Ultimately, the Independent Review Board found that more than $750,000 in union assets had been used in Carey&#x27;s 1996 reelection campaign.

During the 1998 election Tom Leedham, then-director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, campaigned against James P. Hoffa. Campaigning to unite the union, Hoffa won the election. After having lost narrowly in 1996 to Ron Carey, Hoffa&#x27;s new role as president was considered by Teamster members as a chance to rebuild the union.

Hoffa was re-elected in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 to five-year terms.

===1999===
&quot;The first big test of the Hoffa administration&quot; after abruptly walking away from the Overnite Transportation organization effort that Ron Carey had all but won, was the ratification in June 1999, of a four-year contract covering 13,000 carhaul members after an unprecedented amount of communication in the form of rallies, newsletters, and a telephone hotline that was called more than 20,000 times over the course of the contract campaign. Solidarity rallies in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Nashville attracted more than 6,000 carhaulers, family members, and friends. The new contract averted a national strike and included pension gains, job security language, and significant wage increases.

&quot;The new union leader is being closely watched in part because he has pledged to restore unity in Teamsters&#x27; ranks in the wake of a divisive campaign finance scandal.&quot;

Two thousand full-time jobs were created after Teamster pressure on United Parcel Service (UPS) as part of the commitment made by the 1997 contract won by Ron Carey. &quot;My administration sent UPS management a very clear message. We expect UPS to meet their obligations under the 1997 agreement, and we will not tolerate company delays or numbers manipulation.&quot;

===2000s and 2010s===
In April 2000, more than 8,000 flight attendants at Northwest Airlines voted to ratify a new contract with improvements in compensation and retirement packages and ending a 3½ year labor dispute. A decade later, Northwest Airlines merged with Delta Air Lines and ceased operations on January 31, 2010.

Casino workers in Detroit saw an end to biased wages and a disregard for seniority with their new collective bargaining agreement ratified in 2001. The new agreement initiated immediate wage parity between casinos in addition to wage increases in each year of the three-year contract.

Demonstrating increased strength and confidence in Teamster representation Champion Air flight attendants voted for their first Teamster contract in March 2001. The contract resulted in improved pay rates, hours of service, working conditions, and benefits. Union protection remained in effect until the airline ceased all operations on May 31, 2008.

After a month-long strike, bus drivers at Laidlaw Education Services in Los Angeles ratified a new contract in April 2002. The strike occurred due to the disparity between the wages and benefits of drivers who are direct employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District and those paid by Laidlaw.

A landmark agreement with UPS was reached in July 2002 for the 210,000 Teamsters employed there. Hoping to avoid a damaging strike similar to the one in 1997, negotiators at UPS acquiesced to Teamster demands, producing a contract with a 25% increase in wages and benefits. &quot;These negotiations have taken place in an economic climate in which millions of American workers are seeing their health benefits cut and their retirement savings wiped out. We have shown the nation that job and benefit cuts are not inevitable,&quot; said Hoffa.

Mechanics at Continental Airlines ratified a four-year contract resulting in wage and benefit increases in December 2002. This was the second Teamster contract for the 3,300 mechanics and one that made subcontracting nearly impossible due to its defining all maintenance work as being within the jurisdiction of the Teamsters. Continental Airlines was merged into United Airlines in 2012.

A new contract for 65,000 drivers working under the Teamsters National Master Freight Agreement was reached in February 2003. The contract restored the union&#x27;s right to strike when there was a deadlock over grievances, a right given up under a previous contract of 1994. &quot;The nation is in the depths of recession and on the brink of war, and we maintained our strong health care benefits, protected our pensions and won the highest wage increases in more than a decade,&quot; said Hoffa.

Carhaulers ratified a new, five-year contract that protected health benefits and pensions and provided job security for the more than 6,500 members nationwide. The contract included increases of wages and benefits by 13.4% over the term of the agreement.

Chicago area trash haulers represented by the Teamsters reached an agreement in October 2003, ending a nine-day garbage strike that left local officials begging for the garbage trucks. The new contract included higher wages and improvements to health benefits and pensions and covered 3,300 solid waste hauling workers.

Anheuser-Busch Teamsters ratified a new, five-year agreement in December 2003. The Teamsters Union won a guarantee from the company that prohibits the closing of any of its 12 breweries in the United States. Wage increases, free health care, and increased pension benefits were all included in the contract covering 7,500 Teamster members nationwide.

*President George W. Bush appointed Hoffa to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN). &quot;U.S. trade policy has not focused on the economic impact of unfair trade deals on working families. We must shape a trade policy that meets the needs of working families and ends the economic race to the bottom.&quot;
*Members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) voted to merge with the Teamsters Union by an 80% majority. With 32,000 active members, the BLE was one of the oldest labor organizations in the country. The BLE became the first members of the newly created Teamsters Rail Conference. Soon after merging with the Teamsters, the BLE changed its name to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) in recognition of the trainmen of the union.
*In October 2004, members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) voted to become Teamsters. More than 75% of the BMWE&#x27;s members voted to merge with the Teamsters Union and become part of the growing Teamsters Rail Conference. &quot;As did my father, I have envisioned one union representing all transportation workers – roads to rails, ports to planes –that would provide workers with real power on the job and the political arena.&quot;
*A majority of the members of the Graphic Communications International Union (GCIU) voted to merge with the Teamsters Union effective January 2005, making it the third independent union to merge with the Teamsters in 18 months. The union becomes an &quot;autonomous conference&quot; of the Teamsters.

Employees of Allied Waste/BFI in the Atlanta area ratified their first Teamster contract in December 2005. The second-largest U.S. trash hauler, Allied Waste agreed to labor contracts that cover more than 450 workers. The Teamsters secured agreements after a year and half of bargaining during which the company tried to demoralize the union and its members by granting raises to workers in non-union location shops and intimidating union supporters. &quot;These contracts are a testament to the workers&#x27; courage and determination, and a major step forward in our battle to raise living standards for waste workers across the South,&quot; said Hoffa at the time of the victory.

The Teamsters started contract negotiations in September 2006 with UPS over its package workers&#x27; contract and initial bargaining at a UPS Freight terminal in Indianapolis, Indiana. Ken Hall, Director of the Teamsters Parcel and Small Package Division said that the initial contract at the UPS Freight terminal in Indianapolis would serve &quot;as a template or a model for other locations.&quot;

A new, five-year contract was ratified by NetJets mechanics, aircraft fuelers, cleaners, and stock clerks in January 2007.
&quot;At NetJets, Teamsters are making real gains despite negative trends elsewhere,&quot; said Allen Price, Teamsters Local 284 President. The contract covers 143 workers.

A tentative agreement was reached for Teamster members working at Costco in California in January 2007. More than 13,000 workers at 40 locations in the state are covered under the agreement.

Members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWED) and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) ratified a new contract for those working on the nation&#x27;s freight rail lines. The agreement includes general wage increases totaling 17 percent (18.2 percent compounded over the life of the agreement), which will remain effective until December 31, 2009. Both the BMWED and BLET are members of the Teamsters Rail Conference.
Indianapolis Teamsters working at UPS Freight voted to ratify their first contract in October 2007. The agreement will improve wages, benefits, and working conditions. &quot;For more than 50 years, workers at UPS Freight&#x27;s predecessor, Overnite, fought to win a Teamster contract. Today the union fulfilled its promise that we would not quit until workers achieved economic justice.&quot;

UPS Teamsters approved a new contract in November 2007 with a five-year term covering 240,000 workers. The contract will increase wages annually and increase funds that provide pension, health, and welfare benefits. &quot;We…have negotiated an agreement that will greatly benefit our members at U.P.S. as well as Teamster members in other industries covered by pension and health and welfare funds.&quot;

Teamster freight members ratified agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2008 after Hoffa had them &quot;vote until they got it right&quot; . Covering 60,000 workers at YRC Worldwide, Yellow Transportation, Roadway and regional units at USF Holland and New Penn Motor Express. The Memorandum of Understanding included a 15% wage concession, loss of a vacation week, and reduced pension contributions.

On February 20, 2008, Hoffa became the first major union leader to endorse Democratic senator Barack Obama in his bid to become president of the United States. Hoffa campaigned in major states for Obama throughout the primary and general election. He served as a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver and a member of the Michigan Electoral College.

On March 11, 2008, members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance Way Employes (BMWED), part of the Teamsters Rail Conference, approved a new contract with Amtrak after eight years of negotiations. Workers, who had been working for sub-par rates for the past several years, will receive increases of wages and benefits.

Workers at DHL Express ratified a new national agreement in early May 2008. These were the first national agreements negotiated by the Teamsters Union in more than 30 years. &quot;The vote from DHL Express members is a strong signal of support. We were determined to obtain the best contract that we could for members, and I believe we achieved that,&quot; said Hoffa.

Several months after DHL signed the agreement with the Teamsters eliminating the strike clause, more than 85% of the union drivers were laid off. This contract ultimately led to the demise of the union drivers at DHL. Facilities such as DTW (Romulus, Michigan), which had nearly 200 union drivers, now have only approximately 25 drivers in which most of these workers came from the Troy and Southfield location. In all Teamsters Local 299 lost approximately 375 union jobs as the outcome of this contract as well as several thousand jobs throughout the United States.

Teamster carhaulers ratified a new three-year national agreement on October 24, 2008. A record level of employer contributions towards health, welfare, and pension benefits were won by the union by the agreement covering approximately 8,100 workers.

Gaining a 15% wage increase over five years, Teamsters working at Anheuser-Busch facilities in the U.S. voted in a new agreement on November 7, 2008. The contract included the promise that Anheuser-Busch, recently acquired by InBev, would keep all 12 U.S. breweries open for the life of the contract.

For the first time in nearly 40 years, pressmen at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; voted in a Teamster contract in December 2008. The 250 men and women working in the press operations section of the newspaper voted in their first collective bargaining agreement with the Graphic Communications Conference of the Teamsters.

On September 14, pilots with Amerijet Cargo approved their first contract after five years of negotiations. Workers at Amerijet, an air freight carrier, had been on strike since August 27 partly due to the unsanitary conditions on the aircraft. The company will reinstall bathrooms on the aircraft as part of the contract agreement.
For the last 14 months, Hoffa managed the Teamsters&#x27; effort as the union worked with YRC Worldwide (YRCW) as the country&#x27;s largest less-than-truckload company struggled during the recession after their less than strategic, needless purchases of Roadway and USF Holland which Hoffa failed to oppose. The Teamsters and YRCW reached a labor cost savings agreement in August, and YRCW reached new bank terms with its lenders at the end of October.

But in December, Hoffa sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, state attorneys general, state insurance officials and Congressional leaders on financial industry oversight calling on regulators to review the questionable promotion of credit default swaps for bonds of YRCW. Hoffa urged the oversight bodies to investigate financial firms that were underwriting and/or marketing basis packages that consist of YRCW bonds and credit default swaps.

Two days after the letters were sent, YRCW announced it had obtained the necessary thresholds on its bond holder debt-to-equity exchange offer, which was the final part of a comprehensive restructuring plan that required all major stakeholders—its workers, pension funds, secured lenders and bond holders—to contribute toward helping the company survive the worst business decisions in generations.

Hoffa and the Teamsters were credited in several news reports for helping YRCW avert bankruptcy. Bloomberg said Goldman Sachs helped YRCW complete the debt swap after the &quot;Teamsters Union said the bank was trying to profit from a failure of the largest U.S. trucker by sales.&quot;

Hoffa was re-elected to a fourth term heading the Teamsters Union in November 2011. He won nearly 59% of the vote for another five-year term.

The three-way race was between Hoffa, Fred Gegare, and Sandy Pope. Gegare is a Wisconsin Teamster, trustee on a pension fund and a Teamsters International Vice President. Pope was the president of Teamsters Local 805 in New York City.

On May 14, 2019, on PBS NewsHour, Hoffa endorsed President Trump&#x27;s use of tariffs and a trade war with China to bring China to the table for a robust trade deal. He stated that his hope was that the tariffs would work to open the Chinese market for American goods long kept out, and that in the long run, opening the Chinese market would create more American jobs.

==Labor Day speech==

On September 5, 2011, he caused some controversy when introducing President Obama at a Labor Day rally in Detroit, Michigan. In his remarks, an animated Hoffa stated &quot;We have to keep an eye on the battle we face—a war on workers. And you see it everywhere there is the Tea Party. And you know there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about working people is we like a good fight. And you know what, they&#x27;ve got a war, they&#x27;ve got a war with us and there is only going to be one winner. It is going to be the workers of Michigan and America – we are going to win that war. All the way.&quot; He then urged the audience to vote in the coming election and in reference to the Tea Party, stated, &quot;Everybody here&#x27;s got to vote,&quot; Hoffa said. &quot;If we go back and we keep the eye on the prize, let&#x27;s take these sons-of-a-bitches out and give America back to America where we belong!&quot;

Following the fiery remarks, some conservative media outlets chastised the Democratic Party and President Obama for not condemning Hoffa for using violent rhetoric of the kind some claimed as leading to the 2011 Tucson Shooting, while the White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, &quot;Mr. Hoffa speaks for himself, he speaks for the labor movement...The president speaks for himself.&quot; However, Hoffa responded to the controversy by stating, &quot;We didn&#x27;t start this war—the right wing did. My comments on Labor Day in Detroit echo the anger and frustration of American workers who are under attack by corporate-funded politicians who want to destroy the middle class. We&#x27;re tired of seeing good-paying jobs shipped overseas. This fight is about the economy, it&#x27;s about jobs and it&#x27;s about rebuilding America. As I said yesterday in Detroit, we all have to vote in order to take these anti-worker politicians out of office. We&#x27;re fighting back. That&#x27;s what Teamsters do—we stand up for what is right,&quot; Hoffa said. &quot;I will never apologize for standing up for my fellow Teamsters and all American workers.&quot; &quot;National Review&quot;&#x27;s Jonah Goldberg supported Hoffa&#x27;s language, if not the content, saying &quot;We are in a really weird place where the head of the Teamsters can&#x27;t talk tough. I mean, I guess ex-cons are the only ones left who can still talk like men every now and then.&quot; Goldberg went on to state that the issue was not the language, but the &quot;absolutely bizarre standard&quot; for language established after Tucson.

Some commentators and journalists have charged that the context of the quote was changed by editing out the &quot;Everybody here&#x27;s got to vote&quot; passage by the news organization; Fox News Channel and other media outlets, thus fueling the controversy by making the speech sound like a call for violence instead of a call to vote.

==Organizing successes==
Hoffa led a resurgence of the Teamsters resulting in a net increase of members in 2007, the first year of net growth in the union in nearly three decades.

Significant organizing victories included more than 12,600 workers at UPS Freight, 9,000 mechanics at United Airlines, 22,000 school bus drivers at First Student/FirstGroup since 2006 under the union&#x27;s Drive Up Standards campaign, 3,200 customer service representatives at America West Airlines, and nearly 900 crewmembers of Atlas Air, Inc. and Polar Air Cargo Worldwide. In 2009, more than 1,700 school bus workers employed at the Baumann transportation companies on Long Island joined the union.

The organizing victory at UPS Freight was particularly noteworthy, because it is the former Overnite Transportation, which the union struggled to organize for many years and Ron Carey had ready to sign a contract, when Hoffa framed him and walked away from the organization effort. The campaign got a major boost when UPS purchased Overnite, and it became UPS Freight.

&quot;This [UPS Freight] is the largest organizing victory in the freight industry in 25 years. We were amazed that at the 90-day mark of our national campaign, 9,900 workers had signed cards. This shows the workers&#x27; commitment in joining a union that will give them a strong voice in the workplace.&quot;

&quot;We announced two goals for the Teamsters in 2008: To organize 40,000 workers and to elect Barack Obama President of the United States. I am proud to say that thanks to the hard work by so many in our union, the Teamsters delivered on both promises.&quot;

The union&#x27;s successful organizing plan has emphasized the Teamster core industries—particularly those in the global supply chain—and the management of Hoffa and the Teamsters Organizing Department involved the entire union. The bulk of the organizing resulted from coordinated, disciplined campaigns in which numerous Teamster local unions and Joint Councils participated.

Organizing has been a minor theme of Hoffa&#x27;s administration, culminating in 2005, when the Teamsters Union left the AFL–CIO to found the new Change to Win Federation with emphasis on organizing and growth. The union has achieved an annual increase in organizing gains every year since, with 2008 marking a record-breaking year. Hundreds of volunteer member organizers have arranged worker-to-worker contacts between Teamsters and unorganized workers in the same craft.

In 2009, the Teamsters began a project to recruit and train 1,000 member organizers before the end of 2009 to be ready when the Employee Free Choice Act is passed.

&quot;There is no better spokesperson for the Teamsters than a Teamster like you,&quot; Hoffa said. &quot;We are engaged in national campaigns that will test the resources of the union. Without a mighty army of Teamster member organizers, we&#x27;re not going to get it done.&quot;

&quot;We formed our union with the Teamsters so we could have an opportunity to negotiate for fair pay, benefits and equal treatment,&quot; said Nicole Miles, a monitor at First Student in Parkville, Missouri and Local 838 member. &quot;Coming from a Teamster family, I supported the Teamsters because I wanted to be part of a union that will support me. I&#x27;m proud of our vote to join the Teamsters.&quot;

==Split from the AFL–CIO==

Frustrated with the AFL–CIO&#x27;s lack of emphasis on organizing, the Teamsters Union and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) split from the AFL–CIO on July 25, 2005. The group of breakaway unions, which later included the Laborer&#x27;s, United Farm Workers and United Food and Commercial Workers Union, formed their own group called the Change to Win Federation. &quot;We have been disappointed that over the last 10 years [the period of former AFL–CIO President John Sweeney&#x27;s tenure] we have seen a decline in membership, a decline in density.&quot;

Hoffa further explained his union&#x27;s decision to Fox News: &quot;In our view, we must have more union members in order to change the political climate that is undermining workers&#x27; rights in this country. The AFL–CIO has chosen the opposite approach. We proposed that the AFL–CIO embark on a new course of action that would not only protect our existing Teamsters members and their families but lead to thousands of new working men and women to have the opportunity to organize into a strong union that would give them the chance to achieve the American dream to own their own home, send their kids to college and plan a strong retirement.&quot;

Hoffa, while pledging support of the AFL–CIO, said, &quot;Today&#x27;s decision means that we have chosen a course of growth and strength for the American labor movement based on organizing new members. ... This is just the beginning of a new era for America&#x27;s workers.&quot;

Hoffa is an advocate of fair trade policies and a wide range of legislation. He also composed a weblog essay on the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; attacking Whole Foods for undermining efforts to win Congressional reform. Hoffa also spoke on the Thom Hartmann radio program about the politics of health care reform.

<text>Thomas Beckington (also spelt Beckynton; 139014 January 1465) was the Bishop of Bath and Wells and King&#x27;s Secretary in medieval England under Henry VI.

== Life ==

Beckington was born at Beckington in Somerset, and was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. Having entered the Church he held many ecclesiastical appointments, and became dean of the Arches in 1423; and Archdeacon of Buckingham in 1424. After that he devoted his time to secular affairs and was sent on an embassy to Calais in 1439 and to John IV, Count of Armagnac in 1442.

At this time Beckington was acting as secretary to Henry VI, and soon after his return in 1443 he was appointed Lord Privy Seal, an office he held until 1444. He was consecrated Bishop of Bath and Wells on 13 October 1443. The bishop erected many buildings in Wells and elsewhere, probably altering the rectory at Sutton Courtenay in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), an early preferment. The most important results of Beckington&#x27;s missions to France were one Latin journal, written by himself, referring to the embassy to Calais; and another, written by one of his attendants, relating to the journey to Armagnac. He died at Wells on 14 January 1465.

Beckington is buried at Wells Cathedral and has an unusual monument there: his effigy is depicted twice; one above the other in a two tier arrangement, the bottom effigy depicting his decaying corpse whilst unwrapped from its shroud, and the effigy above depicting him in what is assumed to be his bishop&#x27;s attire. When his tomb was opened during Victorian times he was found to be buried very simply (as depicted on his tomb) with just one ornament: his bishop&#x27;s ring. This was removed and is now in a museum.

Beckington played a leading role as architect of the legal aspects of Henry VI&#x27;s foundation of Eton College in 1440; he is commemorated in the name of the school&#x27;s central dining hall, &#x27;Bekynton&#x27;.

In a letter from 1449, Beckington remarked of Bath mentioning that the healing waters of Bath has been turned into abuse by the shamelessness of the inhabitants of the city. Further mentioning:

Bekynton&#x27;s architecture is marked with a symbol depicting a barrel and a flame. This is a pun on his name, being &quot;beacon tun&quot;. One of the easiest to be viewed is in Penniless Porch Wells.

== Works ==
Beckington&#x27;s own journal was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Privy Council&quot;, vol. v., edited by Nicholas Harris Nicolas (1835); and the other journal in the &quot;Official Correspondence of Thomas Bekynton&quot;, edited by George Williams for the Rolls Series (1872), which contains many interesting letters. This second journal was translated into English by Nicolas (1828).

<text>New Ross (, formerly ) is a town in southwest County Wexford, Ireland, on the River Barrow near the border with County Kilkenny, northeast of Waterford. In 2022, it had a population of 8,610, making it the fourth-largest town in the county.

==History==

The port town of New Ross dates from the pre-Middle Ages. The earliest settlement in this area dates to the 6th century when St. Abban of Magheranoidhe founded a monastery in what is now Irishtown. Its name, &quot;Ros&quot;, was shortened from &quot;Ros Mhic Treoin&quot;, or &quot;the Wood of the Son of Treoin&quot;.

New Ross was in the territory of Dermot McMurrough and came to prominence when the Anglo-Normans conquered the region. The Norman knight William Marshall and his bride Isabella de Clare arrived during the early part of the 13th century. An earthen defensive structure called a motte was built at Old Ross in order to hold the newly conquered territory. A medieval borough sprung up around it - peopled by English and Welsh settlers. The arrival of Isabella and William is described in the &quot;Chronicles of Ross&quot;, which are in the British Museum. It records that in 1189, Isabella set about &quot;building a lovely city on the banks of the Barrow&quot;.

The town grew around the bridge built by William Marshal, son-in-law of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (Strongbow), and a leader of the Norman invasion of Ireland. The town of New Ross (the town of the new bridge) was granted a Royal Charter in around 1279. In the late 13th century the town was placed for a time under a papal interdict, following a riot in which several monks of the Order of Crutched Friars were killed.

St Mary&#x27;s Abbey (Church of Ireland) was built in 1210. There are two Roman Catholic churches, the parish church of SS. Michael and Mary completed in 1902, and the Augustinian church opened in 1835.
The town was fought over in the Irish Confederate Wars of the 1640s. In 1643, the town resisted the siege by James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, who fought a battle near the town with an Irish army under Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara but later re-conquered by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 who discharged three cannon shots at the Aldgate. New Ross Town Hall was completed in around 1750.

The town was the location of one of the bloodiest battles of the 1798 rebellion.

==Education==
St Augustine&#x27;s and Good Counsel College, New Ross, is an all-boys school that caters for over 750 students making it by far the largest school in New Ross.

==Sport==
Sporting organisations in the town of New Ross include New Ross RFC, New Ross Celtic Soccer Club, and New Ross Golf Club.There is a swimming club at the Apex Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre called New Ross Swim Club

==Arts and culture==
The town&#x27;s arts centre is St Michael&#x27;s Theatre. The present building was built in 1806, eight years after the insurrection of 1798 and served as the parish church until 1902 when the new parish church, St Mary&#x27;s &amp; Michael&#x27;s, was opened. St Michael&#x27;s has a staff of 12, a 300-seat theatre, a 50-seat studio venue, an art gallery, a cinema, a coffee shop and a bar.
New Ross is home to the Ros Tapestry Project, a community initiative undertaken throughout County Wexford by a team of 150 voluntary embroiderers. The Ros Tapestries depict events including the founding of New Ross by William Marshall. The first tapestry was completed in 2002 and to date all but one of the 15 tapestries are complete. In 2009 the Ros Tapestry Exhibition was opened at The Quay, New Ross.

==Transport==

===Road===
The road crossing the Barrow is the N25 road linking Cork, Waterford City away and Rosslare Harbour away. The N30 links Enniscorthy and New Ross. The R704 and R700 roads connect the town to various towns and villages in County Kilkenny such as Graiguenamanagh, Mullinavat and Kilkenny

===Bus links===
The town is served by several bus routes and its main stop is on the town&#x27;s quay. There are services to and from Waterford each day. Bus Éireann is the principal operator providing Expressway services to Dublin and Dublin Airport and to Rosslare Europort and Cork as well as local services. Wexford Bus operate a service between Wexford and Waterford while Kilbride Coaches operate a route linking the town to Kilkenny. Wexford Local Link operates services to Enniscorthy.

===Rail===
New Ross railway station (Rosbercon) opened on 19 September 1887, closed for passenger traffic on 30 March 1964 and closed for goods traffic by 1995. It was an important link between the lines serving Dublin to Rosslare, Bagenalstown via Palace East and on to Waterford up until the 1960s when CIÉ rationalised the railway network, but the section from Waterford to New Ross remained in use for cement and fertilizer traffic until 1995.

This railway line is currently being repurposed as a cycle greenway - The Southeast Greenway. The first section linking New Ross to Ballyverneen, near Glenmore Co Kilkenny, opened in June 2023.
The greenway will eventually link Palace East to Waterford City via New Ross.

===Sea===
New Ross is Ireland&#x27;s only inland port, located from the sea on the River Barrow. A small marina is located downstream of the town.

The Ros Tapestry Exhibition Centre located on the Quay in New Ross is a series of 15 embroidered Tapestry panels. The tapestries depict Celtic Ireland, Celtic rituals, woman warriors, Brehon Law, early Christian Ireland, the Vikings of Wexford, and the ousting of Diarmait MacMurchada from his Kingdom of Leinster and his sailing to France in search of King Henry II. Also depicted is William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, who married Isabel de Clare, heiress of Strongbow and granddaughter of Diarmait MacMurchada.

<text>John Stafford (died 25 May 1452) was a medieval English prelate and statesman who served as Lord Chancellor (1432–1450) and as Archbishop of Canterbury (1443–1452).

==Early life and education==
Stafford was the illegitimate son of Sir Humphrey Stafford of Southwick, a Wiltshire squire, and required papal permission before he became the rector of Farmborough, vicar of Bathampton and prebendary of Wells.

He was educated at the University of Oxford.

==Career==
Stafford was appointed Dean of Arches in 1419 and served as Archdeacon of Salisbury from 1419 to 1421. From 1423 to 1424 he was Dean of Wells.

He came to note under Henry VI, becoming Lord Privy Seal in 1421 and Lord High Treasurer the following year. He was Lord Chancellor from 1432 to 1450.

On 18 December 1424 Pope Martin V made him Bishop of Bath and Wells, and he was consecrated on 27 May 1425. Pope Eugene IV made him Archbishop of Canterbury in May 1443, a position he held until his death on 25 May 1452. He steered an even course between parties as a moderate man and useful official.

His grand nephew Humphrey Stafford of Hooke rose in prominence in the King&#x27;s party thereafter.

<doc id="433737" wikidata="Q1444483" url="?curid=433737" title="Frank Wolf (politician)">
<text>Frank Rudolph Wolf (born January 30, 1939) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1981 to 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he announced in December 2013 that he would not run for reelection in 2014. Wolf retired at the conclusion of his 17th term in office, in January 2015. At the time of his retirement, he was the dean of the state&#x27;s congressional delegation, having served for 34 consecutive years.

==Early life, education and early political career==

Born and raised in Philadelphia, Wolf overcame an early speech impediment which caused him to stutter. Attending Pennsylvania State University, he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, received a degree in political science and subsequently earned a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. He then joined the United States Army as a reservist and became a lawyer for the military.

Wolf entered politics in 1968, at the age of 29, when he became a legislative assistant to Edward Biester, the Republican congressman from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 8th congressional district. From 1971 to 1975, Wolf served as an assistant to Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

During the 1976 presidential election year, Wolf&#x27;s first campaign for Virginia&#x27;s 10th congressional district ended with his loss in the Republican primary to Vince Callahan by 45%–42%. Two years later, amidst the 1978 midterm elections, he won the Republican nomination unopposed, but lost the general election to the incumbent Democrat, Joseph L. Fisher, 53%–47%.
In the 1980 House election, when Ronald Reagan&#x27;s decisive victory in the presidential election brought with it a 34-seat swing in the House, Wolf&#x27;s third run proved to be successful; he won the Republican primary with 75% of the vote and then defeated Fisher in a rematch, 51%–49%. In the 1982 midterms, Wolf won re-election with 53% of the vote. He would never face another contest anywhere near that close.

Wolf did not face a Democratic opponent in 1994 and 2000, winning both with over 80% of the votes against third-party candidates. After 1982, his closest races were in the Democratic wave elections of 2006 and 2008. On both occasions he defeated professor Judy Feder, by 57%–41% and 59%–39%, respectively. Those were the only occasions after 1982 that he received below 60 percent of the vote.

In the 2012 election, as Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried the district by 1%, Wolf was re-elected by 20%. In September 2013, it was announced that Wolf was to be challenged in the 2014 election by Democrat Richard Bolger, a Fairfax attorney and small business owner. In December 2013, Wolf announced his intention to retire from politics, leaving office in January 2015just days before his 76th birthday. He was succeeded by his former aide, Republican State Delegate Barbara Comstock.

Wolf&#x27;s district was significantly redrawn several times during his 34 years in office. For his first six terms, he represented a compact Northern Virginia-based district covering Fairfax, Arlington, and Loudoun Counties. The 1990 redistricting by a Democratic Virginia General Assembly drew heavily Democratic Arlington County into the neighboring 8th District, while drawing the more Democratic portions of Fairfax County into the new 11th district. To make up for the loss of population, the 10th was pushed to the west and south to encompass parts of the congressional district held by U.S. Rep. George Allen, which was eliminated to create a black-majority district in accordance with the Voting Rights Act. Allen chose not to challenge Wolf, instead running for Governor of Virginia in 1993. The district kept approximately the same complexion after the 2000 apportionment by a Republican Virginia General Assembly, but lost territory in the outlying areas of the district to allow for population growth in Fairfax and Loudoun. In 2013, the Fairfax portion of the district held about 40 percent of the population, Loudoun County held 30 percent, and the remainder of the district at 30 percent.

During his final three terms, Wolf was the only Republican representing a district based in the Washington suburbs on either side of the Potomac River. The neighboring 11th district was taken by Democrat Gerry Connolly in 2008, while the last Republican representing a district on the Maryland side, Connie Morella, had been defeated in 2002.

===Family and Relatives===
In 2022 Wolf&#x27;s grandson, Caleb Max, ran for his seat in the Republican Firehouse Primary for Virginia&#x27;s then redistricted 10th Congressional District. Max was unsuccessful receiving only 728 votes. Max was eliminated in round 8 of the ranked choice ballet counting which included 11 candidates total. 
===Tenure===
Wolf has been especially prominent in three areas: transportation, human rights, and gambling. Before he retired, he was the co-chair of the US Congress Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, formerly the Human Rights Caucus.

In 2010, the NRA Political Victory Fund gave him a B+ and the American Civil Liberties Union gave him 13%, dropping to 0% in 2011. Some other pre-2009 rankings include 0% from Clean Air Flow Energy, 100% from National Right to Life, 0% from the Human Rights Campaign, 17% from the National Educational Association, 5% from the League of Conservation Voters, 92% from the United States Border Control and 10% by the Alliance for Retired Americans.

==== Human rights ====
Wolf has traveled extensively to places around the world where people are suffering, including five times to the Sudan since 1989. He has advocated for relief of the Darfur genocide.
He has also convened conferences in his district to address human rights issues around the world.

After the trial of the leadership of the Baháʼí Faith of Iran was announced on February 11, 2009, Wolf voiced his deep concern over the &quot;systematic persecution&quot; of the Baháʼís. On February 13, Wolf offered a resolution on the subject of the Iranian trial, co-sponsored by seven others, in H. RES. 175 – &quot;Condemning the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baháʼí minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights&quot;; the resolution was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The situation in Iran gathered international attention, including defense of Iranian Nobel Laureate attorney Shirin Ebadi in June, after she received threats in April warning her against making speeches abroad, including her defending Iran&#x27;s minority Baháʼí community.

On September 30, 2010, Wolf spoke against human trafficking during a Black Women United for Action conference at Mount Vernon, George Washington&#x27;s historic home.

On February 28, 2014, along with the Democrat Jackie Speier, Wolf became the co-chair of the &quot;Ahmadiyya Muslim Caucus,&quot; a group created in response to the ongoing persecution of Ahmadis. On May 9, 2014, Wolf introduced the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4653; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to reauthorize the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) as an independent federal government advisory body through FY2019.

==== China ====
Wolf has vocally criticized the human rights record of China. Around the time of the 1995 International Women&#x27;s Conference in Beijing, Wolf called for the Most Favored Nation (MFN) status of China to be revoked, repeating the falsehood that human fetuses were considered a delicacy in China. He was one of the leading congressman trying to stop the grant of permanent MFN status to China in 1999.

When Wolf and Congressman Chris Smith were in Beijing shortly before the 2008 Summer Olympics, the Chinese security service prevented them from participating in a dinner meeting with local human rights lawyers.

In the 2011 United States federal budget, Wolf inserted a clause prohibiting NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from any joint scientific activity with China for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year. Wolf remarked, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to give them the opportunity to take advantage of our technology, and we have nothing to gain from dealing with them. And frankly, it boils down to a moral issue. ... Would you have a bilateral program with Stalin?&quot; This prohibition resulted in Chinese journalists being denied access to the launching of Space Shuttle Endeavour on the mission STS-134, that was carrying the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer which was built in part by Chinese scientists.

In June 2014, Wolf got House support for an amendment that would rename the street holding the Chinese embassy; the amendment would change International Place to Liu Xiaobo Plaza, in honor of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.

==== Iraq War ====
During the Bush administration, Wolf voted consistently with the President&#x27;s positions. For example, Wolf voted in favor of military action in Iraq in 2002. He also voted to make the Patriot Act permanent, opposed requiring Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants for wiretaps within the United States, and supported the president in restricting congressional oversight for CIA interrogations.

However, in March 2006, Congress, at Wolf&#x27;s suggestion by inserting an earmark into a supplemental appropriation bill, and in a breach with the Bush administration, announced the creation of the Iraq Study Group to reassess the U.S. strategy in Iraq.

==== Social issues ====
Wolf opposes abortion and subsidized birth control for federal employees. As congressman, Wolf also voted to deny funding to Planned Parenthood. He also opposes the funding for international family planning in developing countries. Wolf also previously asserted that marriage should only be between one man and one woman. As such, he signed a letter supporting the &quot;one man one woman&quot; issue in the Manhattan Declaration. Wolf sponsored the bill that became the &quot;District of Columbia Civil Contempt Imprisonment Limitation Act&quot;, , in 1989 and supported the bill that became the Elizabeth Morgan Act in 1996.

==== Gambling ====
A 2005 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article cited &quot;opposition to the spread of gambling&quot; as one of Wolf&#x27;s &quot;central causes&quot;. Wolf sought to revise the regulation process for gambling on Native American reservations.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (chairman)
** Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies

===Caucus memberships===
* Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (Co-chair)
* International Conservation Caucus
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus

In the 109th Congress, Wolf was chairman of Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs, and its ranking minority member in the 110th. He was co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus with Jim McGovern, who replaced the late Tom Lantos. Wolf is a member of the Moderate Republican Main Street Partnership.

<doc id="433738" wikidata="Q32991" url="?curid=433738" title="Muhammad ibn al-Qasim">
<text>Muḥammad ibn al-Qāsim al-Thaqafī (; –) was an Arab military commander in service of the Umayyad Caliphate who led the Muslim conquest of Sindh (and Punjab, part of ancient Sindh), inaugurating the Umayyad campaigns in India. His military exploits led to the establishment of the Islamic province of Sindh, and the takeover of the region from the Sindhi Brahman dynasty and its ruler, Raja Dahir, who was subsequently decapitated with his head sent to al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf in Basra. With the capture of the then-capital of Aror by Arab forces, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim became the first Muslim to have successfully captured Indian land, which marked the beginning of Muslim rule in South Asia.

Muhammad ibn al-Qasim belonged to the Banu Thaqif, an Arab tribe that is concentrated around the city of Taif in western Arabia. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, he was assigned as the governor of Fars, likely succeeding his uncle Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi. From 708 to 711, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim led the Sindh conquest. He established Islamic rule throughout the region, serving as governor of Sindh from 712 until his death in 715. After his last conquest of Multan (Punjab) he returned to Arabia where on the way he died in Mosul, in modern Iraq, though some sources record that his body was buried in Makran, a semi-desert coastal region in Balochistan.

==Sources==
Information about Muhammad ibn al-Qasim and the Arab conquest of Sind in the medieval Arabic sources is limited, compared to the contemporary Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. The &quot;Futuh al-Buldan&quot; (&#x27;Conquests of the Lands&#x27;) by al-Baladhuri (d. 892) contains a few pages on the conquest of Sind and Muhammad&#x27;s person, while biographical information is limited to a passage in a work by al-Ya&#x27;qubi (d. 898), a few lines in the history of al-Tabari (d. 839) and scant mention in the &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; (Book of songs) of Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani. A detailed account of Muhammad&#x27;s conquest of Sind and his death is found in the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;, a 13th-century Persian text. The information in the &quot;Chach Nama&quot; purportedly derives from accounts by the descendants of the Arab soldiers of the 8th-century conquest, namely qadis (judges) and imams from the Sindi cities of Alor and Bhakar who claimed descent from Muhammad&#x27;s tribe, the Banu Thaqif. The Orientalist Francesco Gabrieli holds the accounts likely emerged after and considers the &quot;Chach Nama&quot; to be a &quot;historical romance&quot; and &quot;a late and doubtful source&quot; for information about Muhammad.

==Origins and early life==
Muhammad was born in . His birthplace was almost certainly in the Hejaz (western Arabia), either in Ta&#x27;if, the traditional home of his Thaqif tribe, or in Mecca or Medina. Following their general embrace of Islam in , members of the Thaqif gradually attained high military and administrative ranks in the nascent Caliphate and played important command and economic roles during and after the early Muslim conquests, particularly in Iraq. The tribe produced effective commanders associated with early Arab military operations against the Indian subcontinent: in the Thaqafite governor of Bahrayn (eastern Arabia), Uthman ibn Abi al-As, dispatched naval expeditions against the Indian ports of Debal, Thane and Bharuch. The tribe&#x27;s power continued to increase with the advent of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661.

Muhammad belonged to the Abu Aqil family of the Banu Awf, one of the two principal branches of the Thaqif. The Abu Aqil family gained prestige with the rise of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the paternal first cousin of Muhammad&#x27;s father al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hakam. Al-Hajjaj was made a commander by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik () during the Second Muslim Civil War and killed the Umayyads&#x27; chief rival for the caliphate, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, in 692, and two years later was appointed the viceroy of Iraq and the eastern Caliphate. Following his promotion, al-Hajjaj became a patron of the Thaqif and appointed several members to important posts in Iraq and its dependencies. Muhammad&#x27;s father was appointed the deputy governor of Basra, though his career was otherwise undistinguished. According to a letter between Muhammad and al-Hajjaj cited by the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;, Muhammad&#x27;s mother was a certain Habibat al-Uzma (Habiba the Great). The &quot;Chach Nama&quot; also indicates Muhammad had a similar-aged brother named Sulb and Arabic sources indicate he had a much younger brother named al-Hajjaj, who served as an Umayyad commander during the Alid revolt of 740.

No information is provided by the Arabic sources about Muhammad&#x27;s childhood and adolescence. The modern historian Nabi Bakhsh Baloch holds that Muhammad most likely grew up partly in Ta&#x27;if and then Basra and Wasit, the provincial capital of Iraq founded by al-Hajjaj in 702. Muhammad&#x27;s time in Basra, a military and intellectual centre of the Islamic world at the time, may have widened Muhammad&#x27;s career horizons, while at Wasit he was likely educated and trained under al-Hajjaj&#x27;s patronage.

Al-Hajjaj was highly fond of Muhammad, and considered him prestigious enough to marry his sister Zaynab, though she preferred the older Thaqafite al-Hakam ibn Ayyub ibn al-Hakam, to whom she was ultimately wed. The &quot;Kitab al-aghani&quot; refers to Muhammad at the age of 17 as &quot;the noblest Thaqafite of his time&quot;. In the summation of Baloch, &quot;Muhammad grew up under favourable conditions into an able, energetic and cultured lad of fine tastes&quot;.

==Governor of Fars==
Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s first assignment was in the province Fars in modern Iran, where he was asked to subjugate a group of Kurds. After the successful completion of the mission, he was appointed as the governor of Fars. He likely succeeded his uncle Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, a brother of al-Hajjaj, who was previously a governor. The city of Shiraz is said to have been revived by Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. He built a royal villa in the city and a military camp at a short distance from it. He was also given the task of subjugating the area to the south of Shiraz, and the distant area of Jurjan near the Caspian Sea.

Fars might have also had at this time some of the rebels leftover from the revolt of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath, which almost brought down the rule of al-Hajjaj. An aged supporter of rebels and a Shia notable of the time, a disciple of the companion of Jabir ibn Abd Allah al-Ansari and a famous narrator of Hadith, Atiyya ibn Sa&#x27;d al-Awfi was arrested by Muhammad ibn al-Qasim on the orders of Al-Hajjaj and demanded that he curse Ali on the threat of punishment. Atiyya refused to curse Ali and was punished. While Maclean doesn&#x27;t give the details of the punishment, early historians like Ibn Hajar Al-asqalani and Tabari record that he was flogged by 400 lashes and his head and beard shaved for humiliation and that he fled to Khurasan and returned to Iraq after the ruler had been changed.

==Background on Sindh==
===Early Muslim presence===

The connection between the Hindu Sind and Islam was established by the initial Muslim missions during the Rashidun Caliphate. Hakim ibn Jabala al-Abdi, who attacked Makran in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of Ali ibn Abu Talib. During the caliphate of Ali, many Jats of Sindh had come under influence of Islam and some even participated in the Battle of Camel and died fighting for Ali. Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi and Sayfi ibn Fasayl&#x27; al-Shaybani, both officers of Ali&#x27;s army, attacked Makran in the year 658. Sayfi was one of the seven shias who were beheaded alongside Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi in 660 AD near Damascus. Under the Umayyads (661–750 AD), many Shias sought asylum in the region of Sindh, to live in relative peace in the remote area. Ziyad Hindi is one of those refugees.

===Umayyad interest in Sindh===
According to Wink, Umayyad interest in the region was galvanised by the operation of the &quot;Meds&quot; (a tribe of Scythians living in Sindh) and others. The Meds had engaged in piracy on Sassanid shipping in the past, from the mouth of the Tigris to the Sri Lankan coast, in their &quot;bawarij&quot; and now were able to prey on Arab shipping from their bases at Kutch, Debal and Kathiawar. At the time, Sindh was the wild frontier region of al-Hind, inhabited mostly by semi-nomadic tribes whose activities disturbed much of the Western Indian Ocean. Muslim sources insist that it was these persistent activities along increasingly important Indian trade routes by Debal pirates and others which forced the Arabs to subjugate the area, in order to control the seaports and maritime routes of which Sindh was the nucleus, as well as, the overland passage. During Hajjaj&#x27;s governorship, the &quot;Meds&quot; of Debal in one of their raids had kidnapped Muslim women travelling from Sri Lanka to Arabia, thus providing grounds to the rising power of the Umayyad Caliphate that enabled them to gain a foothold in the Makran, Balochistan and Sindh regions.
Also cited as a reason for this campaign was the policy of providing refuge to Sassanids fleeing the Arab advance and to Arab rebels from the Umayyad consolidation of their rule.

These Arabs were imprisoned later on by Governor Deebal Partaab Rai. A letter written by an Arab girl named Nahed who escaped from the prison of Partab Rai asked Hajjaj Bin Yusuf for help. When Hajjaj asked Dahir for the release of prisoners and compensation, the latter refused on the ground that he had no control over those. Al-Hajjaj sent Muhammad ibn al-Qasim for action against the Sindh in 711. 

The mawali (new non-Arab converts) who were usually allied with Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s political opponents and thus were frequently forced to participate in battles on the frontier of the Umayyad Caliphate, such as Kabul, Sindh and Transoxania. An actual push into the region had been out of favour as an Arab policy since the time of the Rashidun Caliph Umar bin Khattab, who upon receipt of reports of it being an inhospitable and poor land, had stopped further expeditionary ventures into the region.

==Conquest of valley of Sindh==

Hajjaj had put more care and planning into this campaign than the second campaign. Al-Hajjaj gave Muhammad ibn al-Qasim command of the expedition between 708 and 711, when he was only 15–17 years old, apparently because two previous Umayyad commanders had not been successful in punishing Sindh&#x27;s ruler Raja Dahir for his failure to prevent pirates from disrupting Muslim shipping off the coast of Sindh. Al-Hajjaj superintended this campaign from Kufa by maintaining close contact with Muhammad ibn al-Qasim in the form of regular reports for which purpose special messengers were deputed between Basra and Sindh. The army which departed from Shiraz under Muhammad ibn al-Qasim consisted of 6,000 Syrian cavalry and detachments of &quot;mawali&quot; (sing. &quot;mawla&quot;; non-Arab, Muslim freedmen) from Iraq. At the borders of Sindh he was joined by an advance guard and six thousand camel cavalry and later, reinforcements from the governor of Makran were transferred directly to Debal (Daybul), at the mouth of the Indus, by sea along with five &quot;manjaniks&quot; (catapults). The army that eventually captured Sindh would later be swelled by the Jats and Meds as well as other irregulars who heard of the Arab successes in Sindh. When Muhammad ibn al-Qasim passed through the Makran desert while raising his forces, he had to subdue the restive towns of Fannazbur and Arman Belah (Lasbela), both of which had previously been conquered by the Arabs.

The first town assaulted in Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s Sindh campaign was Debal and upon the orders of al-Hajjaj, he exacted retribution on Debal by giving no quarter to its residents or priests and destroying its great temple. From Debal, the Arab army then marched north-east taking towns such as Nerun and Sadusan (Sehwan) without fighting. One-fifth of the war booty including slaves were remitted to al-Hajjaj and the Caliph. The conquest of these towns was accomplished with relative ease; however, Dahir&#x27;s armies being prepared on the other side of the Indus had not yet been confronted. In preparation to meet them, Muhammad returned to Nerun to resupply and receive reinforcements sent by al-Hajjaj. Camped on the east bank of the Indus, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim sent emissaries and bargained with the river Jats and boatmen. Upon securing the aid of Mokah Basayah, &quot;the King of the island of Bet&quot; (considered traitor by Sindhis), Muhammad crossed over the river where he was joined by the forces of the Thakore of Bhatta and the western Jats.

At Aror (Rohri) Muhammad ibn al-Qasim was met by Dahir&#x27;s forces and the eastern Jats in battle. Dahir died in the battle, his forces were defeated and Muhammad ibn al-Qasim took control of Sindh. 

Soon the capitals of the other provinces, Brahmanabad, Alor (Battle of Aror) and Multan, were captured alongside other in-between towns with only light Muslim casualties. Multan was a key site in the Hindu religion. Usually after a siege of a few weeks or months the Arabs gained a city through the intervention of heads of mercantile houses with whom subsequent treaties and agreements would be settled. After battles all fighting men were executed and their wives and children enslaved in considerable numbers and the usual fifth of the booty and slaves were sent to al-Hajjaj. The general populace was encouraged to carry on with their trades and taxes and tributes settled.

The conquest of Sindh (and areas of Punjab) in modern-day Pakistan, although costly, was a major gain for the Umayyad Caliphate. However, further gains were halted by Hindu kingdoms during Arab campaigns. The Arabs attempted to invade India but they were defeated by North Indian kings Bappa Rawal of Guhila dynasty, Nagabhata, of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty and by the South Indian emperor Vikramaditya II of the Chalukya dynasty in the early 8th century. After the failure of further expeditions on Kathiawar, the Arab chroniclers conceded that the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi () &quot;gave up the project of conquering any part of India.&quot;

===Military and political strategy===
The military strategy had been outlined by Al-Hajjaj in a letter sent to Muhammad ibn al-Qasim:
My ruling is given: Kill anyone belonging to the &quot;ahl-i-harb&quot; (combatants); arrest their sons and daughters for hostages and imprison them. Whoever does not fight against us...grant them &quot;aman&quot; (peace and safety) and settle their tribute [&quot;amwal&quot;] as &quot;dhimmah&quot; (protected person)...

The Arabs&#x27; first concern was to facilitate the conquest of Sindh with the fewest casualties while also trying to preserve the economic infrastructure. Towns were given two options: submit to Islamic authority peacefully or be attacked by force (), with the choice governing their treatment upon capture. The capture of towns was usually accomplished by means of a treaty with a party from among the enemy, who were then extended special privileges and material rewards. There were two types of such treaties, &quot;&quot;Sulh&quot; or &quot;ahd-e-wasiq&quot; (capitulation)&quot; and &quot;&quot;aman&quot; (surrender/ peace)&quot;. Among towns and fortresses that were captured through force of arms, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim performed executions of &quot;ahl-i-harb&quot; (fighting men) as part of his military strategy, whose surviving dependants were enslaved.

Casualties

Where resistance was strong, prolonged, and intensive, often resulting in considerable Arab casualties, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s response was dramatic, inflicting 6,000 deaths at Aror (Rohri), between 6,000 and 26,000 at Brahmanabad, 4,000 at Iskalandah (Uch), and 6,000 at Multan. Conversely, in areas taken by &quot;sulh&quot;, such as Armabil, Nirun, and Aror, resistance was light and few casualties occurred. Sulh appeared to be Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s preferred mode of conquest, the method used for more than 60% of the towns and tribes recorded by al-Baladhuri and the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;. At one point, he was actually berated by Al-Hajjaj for being too lenient. Meanwhile, the common folk were often pardoned and encouraged to continue working; Al-Hajjaj ordered that this option not be granted to any inhabitant of Debal, yet Muhammad ibn al-Qasim still bestowed it upon certain groups and individuals.

===Reasons for success===
Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s success has been partly ascribed to Dahir being an unpopular Hindu king ruling over a Buddhist majority who saw Chach of Alor and his kin as usurpers of the Rai dynasty. This is attributed to having resulted in support being provided by Buddhists and inclusion of rebel soldiers serving as valuable infantry in his cavalry-heavy force from the Jat and Meds. Brahman, Buddhist, Greek, and Arab testimony however can be found that attests towards amicable relations between the adherents of the two religions up to the 7th century.

Along with this were:
# Superior military equipment; such as siege engines and the Mongol bow.
# Troop discipline and leadership.
# The concept of Jihad as a morale booster.
# Religion, i.e. the widespread belief in the prophecy of Muslim success.
# The Samanis being persuaded to submit and not take up arms because the majority of the population was Buddhist who were dissatisfied with their rulers, who were Hindu.
# The labouring under disabilities of the Lohana Jats.
# Defections from among Dahir&#x27;s chiefs and nobles.

==Administration of Sindh==

After the conquest, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s task was to set up an administrative structure for a stable Muslim state that incorporated a newly conquered alien land, inhabited by non-Muslims. He adopted a conciliatory policy, asking for acceptance of Muslim rule by the natives in return for non-interference in their religious practice, so long as the natives paid their taxes and tribute. In return, the state provided protection to non-Muslim from any foreign attacks and enemies. He established Islamic Sharia law over the people of the region; however, Hindus were allowed to rule their villages and settle their disputes according to their own laws, and traditional hierarchical institutions, including the village headmen () and chieftains () were maintained. A Muslim officer called an &quot;amil&quot; was stationed with a troop of cavalry to manage each town on a hereditary basis

Everywhere taxes (&quot;mal&quot;) and tribute (&quot;kharaj&quot;) were settled and hostages taken — occasionally this also meant the custodians of temples. Non-Muslim natives were excused from military service and from payment of the religiously mandated tax system levied upon Muslims called Zakat, the tax system levied upon them instead was the jizya - a progressive tax, being heavier on the upper classes and light for the poor. In addition, three percent of government revenue was allocated to the Brahmins.

===Incorporation of ruling elite into administration===
During his administration, Hindus and Buddhists were inducted into the administration as trusted advisors and governors. A Hindu, Kaksa, was at one point the second most important member of his administration. Dahir&#x27;s prime minister and various chieftains were also incorporated into the administration.

===Clashes with the Jats===
Significant medieval Muslim chronicles such as the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;, &quot;Zainul-Akhbar&quot; and &quot;Tarikh-I-Baihaqi&quot; have recorded battles of Jats of Sindh and Balochistan against the invading forces of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim and other Muslims. 

The legendary Six battles of Kinan parallel the battle of Thermopylae, where a small contingent of pastoral Jat warriors defeated a massive Muslim army. Despite facing a vastly superior Muslim military in numbers, training, and weaponry, Jats inflicted a crushing defeat on Arabic invaders, a humiliation so profound it was taken personally by the Muslim Caliph. Chach Nama reports that the mountain-dwelling brave and agile Jats of Kikan or Kikanan or Kizkanan near Bolan Pass in Balochistan, likely same as present-day Kalat, summarily defeated invading Arabic Muslim forces of Haras and killed Haras in 662, only a small portion of Muslim forces returned to caliphate. The impact of Muslim defeat was so significant that for next 20 years each successive caliph made Kikan a special target for attack and sent 6 expeditions of which 5 &quot;failed miserably&quot; and &quot;failed to make any permanent impression&quot; in Sindh.


The eastern Hindu Jats supported the Sindhi king, Dahir, against the Arab Muslim invaders, whereas the western Jats aligned with Muhammad bin Qasim (708-711 CE) against Dahir. At battle of Aror (Rohri), the united forces of Dahir and the eastern Jats jointly fought against Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. Rani Bai, the queen of King Dahir, had Jat origins, her father was Jat. Al-Baladhuri&#x27;s historical accounts document that the Jat people displayed a strong sense of independence, following the Muslim incursions into Sindh, some Jats, along with their livestock (buffalo), were taken to Iraq where they engaged in disruptive and rebellious activities. After defeating Dahir, Muhammad bin al-Qasim turned against the Jats and Lohanas, the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;, &quot;Zainul-Akhbar&quot; and &quot;Tarikh-i Bayhaqi&quot; have recorded battles between Hindu Jats and forces of Muhammad ibn Qasim. 

After the death of Hajjaj in 714 CE, the son of Dahir, Jaisimba (Jaisiah) reconquered the Brahmanabad during the time of Umayyad caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715-717). Jaisimba was later killed in a battle with Umayyad governor of Sindh, Junayd ibn Abd ar-Rahman al-Murri (r. 723 to 726 CE). However, the Jats and Meds continue to mount a formidable resistance against the Muslim forces around the ancient Sindhi capital of Alor (near Sukkur) during the time of caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809), in which Muslims did not fare well. David Nicolle writes that &quot;The resident Buddhist Jats [of Sindh] remained formidable warriors until they dropped out of historical records from the 11th to 17th century.&quot;

===Religion===
Lane-Poole writes that, &quot;as a rule Muslim government was at once tolerant and economic&quot;. The preference of collection of jizya over the conversion to Islam is a major economic motivator. Hindus and Buddhists who were classified as Dhimmis had to pay mandatory Jizya instead of Zakat paid by Muslims. Contrastingly preferential treatment was given to a small number of people who were converted to Islam by &quot;exempting them from Jizya in lieu of paying the Zakat&quot;. Muhammad ibn al-Qasim fixed the Zakat at 10% of the agricultural produce. Others had to pay the mandatory jizya. &quot;In Al-Biruni&#x27;s narrative&quot;, according to Manan Ahmed Asif – a historian of Islam in South and South East Asia, &quot;Muhammad bin Qasim first asserts the superiority of Islam over the polytheists by committing a taboo (killing a cow) and publicly soiling the idol (giving the cow meat as an offering)&quot; before allowing the temple to continue as a place of worship.

A religious Islamic office, &quot;sadru-I-Islam al affal&quot;, was created to oversee the secular governors. The native hereditary elites were reappointed with the title of Rana. According to Yohanan Friedmann, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim declared that the Brahmins of Brahmanabad were good people.

While proselytization occurred, given the social dynamics of areas of Sindh conquered by Muslim, the spread of Islam was slow and took centuries. No mass conversions to Islam took place and some temples escaped destruction such as the Sun Temple of Multan on payment of jizya. In the Arab settlers controlled areas of Sindh and Multan, conversion to Islam occurred only slowly, not on a massive scale. Majority of the population continued to remain Hindu who had to pay the jizya imposed by the Muslim state.

It has been reported that Muhammad ibn al-Qasim met with Sayyida Ruqayya bint Ali (Bibi Pak Daman) in India, a daughter of Ali ibn Abi Talib the son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the fourth Rashidun caliph (r. 656-661). The events of the massacre of Muhammad&#x27;s family at Karbala (680 CE) caused many relatives of Muhammad including Ruqayyah to migrate to Makran. Among her potential assassins had been Muhammad Bin Qasim who later switched allegiances and became a supporter of Ruqayyah after learning of the sufferings experienced by the family of Muhammad.

==Death==
Al-Hajjaj died in 714, followed a year later by Caliph al-Walid I, who was succeeded by his brother Sulayman. The latter took revenge against the generals and officials who had been close to al-Hajjaj. Sulayman owed political support to al-Hajjaj&#x27;s opponents and so recalled both of al-Hajjaj&#x27;s successful generals Qutayba ibn Muslim, the conqueror of Transoxiana (Central Asia), and Muhammad. He also appointed the son of the distinguished general al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, Yazid, who was once imprisoned and tortured by al-Hajjaj, as the governor of Fars, Kirman, Makran, and Sind; he immediately placed Muhammad in chains.

Muhammad ibn al-Qasim died on 18 July 715 in Mosul which is a part of the modern-day Iraq. Some sources say that his body was transferred to Makran in Balochistan at the Hingol National Park which is part of modern-day Pakistan.

There are two different accounts regarding the details of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s fate:

* According to al-Baladhuri Muhammad was killed due to a family feud with the governor of Iraq. Sulayman was hostile toward Muhammad because apparently, he had followed the order of Hajjaj to declare Sulayman&#x27;s right of succession void in all territories conquered by him. When Muhammad received the news of the death of al-Hajjaj he returned to Aror. Muhammad was later arrested under the orders of the Caliph by the replacement governor of Sindh, Yazid ibn Abi Kabsha al-Saksaki, who worked under the new military governor of Iraq, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, and the new fiscal governor, the &quot;mawla&quot; Salih ibn Abd al-Rahman. Salih, whose brother was executed by al-Hajjaj, tortured Muhammad and his relatives to death. The account of his death by al-Baladhuri is brief compared to the one in the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;.
* The &quot;Chach Nama&quot; narrates a tale in which Muhammad&#x27;s demise is attributed to the daughters of Raja Dahir of Aror (Sind), Surya Devi and Parimal Devi, who had been taken captive during the campaign. Upon capture their mother had been made a slave of ibn Qasim himself, while the two sisters had been sent on as presents to the Caliph for his harem in the capital Baghdad (however Baghdad had not yet been built and the actual capital was Damascus). The account relates that they then tricked the Caliph into believing that ibn Qasim had violated them before sending them on and as a result of this subterfuge, ibn Qasim was wrapped and stitched in oxen hides, and sent to Syria, which resulted in his death en route from suffocation. This narrative attributes their motive for this subterfuge to securing vengeance for their father&#x27;s death. Upon discovering this subterfuge, the Caliph is recorded to have been filled with remorse and ordered the sisters buried alive in a wall.

==Aftermath==
After Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s departure, the next appointed Arab governor died on arrival. Dahir&#x27;s son recaptured Brahmanabad and c. 720, he was granted pardon and included in the administration in return for converting to Islam. Soon, however, he recanted and split off when the Umayyads were embroiled in a succession crisis. Later, Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri killed Jaisiah and recaptured the territory before his successors once again struggled to hold and keep it.

Arab states in South Asia

During the Abbasid period, c. 870, the local emirs shook off all allegiance to the caliphs and by the 10th century the region was split into two separate states, Mansurah on the lower Indus and Multan on the upper Indus, both were the major Arab principalities in South Asia, which were soon captured by Ismailis who set up an independent Fatimid state. The Arab conquest remained checked in what is now the south of Pakistan for three centuries by powerful Hindu monarchs to the north and east until the arrival of Mahmud of Ghazni.

==Controversy==
There is controversy regarding the conquest and subsequent conversion of Sindh. This is usually voiced in two antagonistic perspectives viewing Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s actions.

His conquest, as described by Stanley Lane-Poole, in Medieval India (Published in 1970 by Haskell House Publishers Ltd), was &quot;liberal&quot;. He imposed the customary poll tax, took hostages for good conduct and spared peoples&#x27; lives and lands. He even left their shrines undesecrated: &#x27;The temples;&#x27; he proclaimed, &#x27;shall be inviolate, like the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and altars of the Magians&#x27;. In the same text, however, it is mentioned that &quot;Occasional desecration of Hindu fanes took place... but such demonstrations were probably rare sops to the official conscience...&quot;, as destruction of temples and civilian massacres still took place.

#&quot;Coercive conversion&quot; has been attributed to early historians such as Elliot, Cousens, Majumdar and Vaidya. They hold the view that the conversion of Sindh was necessitated. Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s numerical inferiority is said to explain any instances of apparent religious toleration, with the destruction of temples seen as a reflection of the more basic, religiously motivated intolerance.
#&quot;Voluntary conversion&quot; has been attributed to Thomas W. Arnold and modern Muslim historians such as Habib and Qureishi. They believe that the conquest was largely peaceful, and the conversion entirely so, and that the Arab forces enacted liberal, generous and tolerant policies. These historians mention the &quot;praiseworthy conduct of Arab Muslims&quot; and attribute their actions to a &quot;superior civilizational complex&quot;.

Various polemical perceptions of Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism are also reflected in this debate. The period of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s rule has been called by U.T. Thakkur &quot;the darkest period in Sindh history&quot;, with the records speaking of massive forced conversions, temple destruction, slaughters and genocides; the people of Sindh, described as inherently pacifist due to their Hindu/Buddhist religious inclinations, had to adjust to the conditions of &quot;barbarian inroad&quot;. On one extreme, the Arab Muslims are seen as being compelled by religious stricture to conquer and forcibly convert Sindh, but on the other hand, they can be seen as being respectful and tolerant of non-Muslims as part of their religious duty, with conversion being facilitated by the vitality, equality and morals of the Islamic religion. Citations of towns taken either violently or bloodlessly, reading back into Arab Sindh information belonging to a later date and accounts such as those of the forcible circumcision of Brahmins at Debal or Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s consideration of Hindu sentiment in forbidding the slaughter of cows are used as examples for one particular view or the other.

Some historians strike a middle ground, saying that Muhammad ibn al-Qasim was torn between the political expediency of making peace with the Hindus and Buddhists; having to call upon non-Muslims to serve under him as part of his mandate to administer newly conquered land; and orthodoxy by refraining from seeking the co-operation of &quot;infidels&quot;. It is contended that he may have struck a middle ground, conferring the status of Dhimmi upon the native Sindhis and permitting them to participate in his administration, but treating them as &quot;non-citizens&quot; (i.e. in the Caliphate, but not of it).

While Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s warring was clearly at times brutal, he is supposed to have said of Hinduism that &#x27;the idol temple is similar to the churches of the Christians, (to the synagogues) of the Jews and to the fire temples of the Zoroastrians&#x27; (&quot;mā al-budd illā ka-kanāʾis al-naṣārā wa ’l-yahūd wa-buyūt nīrān al-madjūs&quot;). This &#x27;seems to be the earliest statement justifying the inclusion of the Hindus in the category of &quot;ahl al-dhimma&quot;, leading Muhammad to be falsely viewed by many modern Muslims as a paragon of religious tolerance.

==Legacy==

Muhammad ibn al-Qasim&#x27;s presence and rule was very brief. His conquest for the Umayyads brought Sindh into the orbit of the Muslim world. After the conquest of Sindh, he adopted the Hanafi school of Sharia law which regarded Hindus, Buddhists and Jains as &quot;dhimmis&quot; and &quot;People of the Book&quot;, allowing them religious freedom as long as they continued to pay the tax known as &quot;jizya&quot;. This approach would prove critical to the way Muslim rulers ruled in India over the next centuries. Coastal trade and a Muslim colony in Sindh allowed for cultural exchanges and the arrival of Sufi missionaries to expand Muslim influence.

From Debal, which remained an important port until the 12th century, commercial links with the Persian Gulf and the Middle East intensified as Sindh became the &quot;hinge of the Indian Ocean Trade and overland passway.&quot; Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, claimed that the Pakistan movement started when the first Muslim put his foot on the soil of Sindh, the Gateway of Islam in India. He is often referred to as the first Pakistani according to Pakistan Studies curriculum. Yom-e Bab ul-Islam is observed in Pakistan, in honour of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim.

Port Qasim, Pakistan&#x27;s second major port, is named in honor of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. Bagh Ibn Qasim is the largest park in Karachi (Sindh, Pakistan), named in honour of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. Ibn-e-Qasim Bagh Stadium, Multan is a multi-use stadium named after Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. The Pakistan Naval Station Qasim, or PNS Qasim, is the major naval special operations base for the Amphibious Special Operations Forces in the Pakistan Navy named after Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. Bin Qasim Town in Karachi is named after Muhammad ibn al-Qasim.

in 1996 PTV Series &quot;Labbaik&quot; he was played by Babar Ali and 2019 Egyptian animated musical film &quot;The Knight and the Princess&quot;

<text>A spitball is a now-illegal baseball pitch in which the ball has been altered by the application of a foreign substance such as saliva or petroleum jelly. This technique alters the wind resistance and weight on one side of the ball, causing it to move in an atypical manner. It may also cause the ball to &quot;slip&quot; out of the pitcher&#x27;s fingers without the usual spin that accompanies a pitch. In this sense, a spitball can be thought of as a fastball with knuckleball action. Alternative names for the spitball are &quot;spitter&quot;, &quot;mud ball&quot;, &quot;shine ball&quot;, &quot;supersinker&quot;, or &quot;vaseline ball&quot; (because originally, Vaseline was used to give the ball a little more break). A spitball technically differs from an emery ball, in which the surface of the ball is cut or abraded. Saliva or Vaseline smooths the baseball, while the emery paper roughens it. The general term for altering the ball in any way is &quot;doctoring&quot;.

==History==

The invention of the spitball has been popularly credited to a number of individuals, among them Elmer Stricklett and Frank Corridon. Numerous accounts, however, refer to different players experimenting with versions of the spitball throughout the latter half of the 19th century, and it remains unlikely that any one individual &quot;invented&quot; the spitball.

Ed Walsh, however, is certainly responsible for popularizing it. Walsh dominated the American League from 1906 to 1912, primarily on the strength of his spitball, and pitchers around the league soon copied his spitball or invented their own trick pitch.

The dramatic increase in the popularity of &quot;freak deliveries&quot; led to a great deal of controversy throughout the 1910s regarding the abolition of the spitball and related pitches. In his autobiography, Ty Cobb wrote that such &quot;freak pitches [...] were outlawed when the owners greedily sold out to home runs.&quot;

In addition, there were serious issues with the spitball, including some that affected safety. A variation on the standard spitball called for the pitcher to smear the entire surface of the normally white ball with a mixture of tobacco spittle and dirt or mud in order to stain it the same deep brown color as the infield which made it nearly impossible for batters to see (and sometimes avoid) in low-light conditions. In August 1920, Ray Chapman was killed when he was struck in the temple by a pitch thrown by known spitball pitcher Carl Mays during a poorly lit game.

==Ban==
In Major League Baseball (MLB), the spitball was banned in two stages. In the winter of 1919–1920, managers voted to partially ban the spitball. Each team was allowed to designate up to two pitchers who would be permitted to throw spitballs. After the 1920 season, the use of the spitball was banned with the exception of a group of 17 existing spitballers, who became legacy spitballers who were allowed to throw the pitch legally until they retired.

Of the exempted group, Burleigh Grimes lasted the longest, retiring in 1934. The complete list of exempted spitballers is: Ray Fisher (played through 1920); Doc Ayers (1921); Ray Caldwell (1921); Phil Douglas (1922); Dana Fillingim (1925); Marv Goodwin (1925); Dutch Leonard (1925); Allen Russell (1925); Allen Sothoron (1926); Dick Rudolph (1927); Stan Coveleski (1928); Urban Shocker (1928); Bill Doak (1929); Clarence Mitchell (1932); Red Faber (1933); Jack Quinn (1933); and Grimes.

In March 1955, MLB Commissioner Ford Frick advocated for the return of the spitball, telling a sportswriter, &quot;If I had my way, I&#x27;d legalize the old spitter. It was a great pitch and one of the easiest to throw. There was nothing dangerous about it.&quot; Despite the Commissioner&#x27;s enthusiasm, the pitch remained illegal.

==Methodology==
The spitball is now banned in Major League baseball. It is a pitching violation in NCAA Baseball. However, it is still sometimes thrown in violation of the rules. In 1942, Leo Durocher, then-manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, fined Bobo Newsom for throwing a spitball and &quot;lying to me about it.&quot; Typically, a lubricant is hidden behind the pitcher&#x27;s knee or under the peak of his cap. Others will place the ball in their mitt and then cough on or lick it. Another tactic pitchers use is to soak their hair in water before going out to the mound, and then rub their hair before a pitch.

Preacher Roe, who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950s, was renowned both for his ability to control the spitball and to throw it without getting caught and described his methodology in a 1955 article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. &quot;The Outlawed Spitball Was My Money Pitch&quot; was published a year after he retired. Another famous user of the pitch was Gaylord Perry, who went so far as to title his autobiography &quot;Me and the Spitter&quot; and chronicled the clever ways in which he avoided detection. For example, Perry would put Vaseline on his zipper because umpires would never check a player&#x27;s groin. Don Drysdale also used the pitch regularly, as did Lew Burdette. Drysdale would apply oil to the back of his hair to put on the ball to make it sink. Mike Fiers has been accused of doctoring the baseball during both his no-hitters.

==Legal spits==
The name dry spitter is sometimes used to describe a pitch that moves like a spitball without saliva, such as the forkball or split-finger fastball. It is sometimes used simply as slang for the knuckleball.

There is also the remote term of God-given spitter, which is when the ball is naturally dampened by moist air or light rainfall, which allows pitchers to be able to throw pitches with sharper breaks, much like a spitball.

<doc id="433740" wikidata="Q293460" url="?curid=433740" title="Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf">
<text>Abu Muhammad al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ibn al-Hakam ibn Abi Aqil al-Thaqafi (; ), known simply as al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (), was the most notable governor who served the Umayyad Caliphate. He began his service under Caliph Abd al-Malik (), who successively promoted him as the head of the Caliph&#x27;s (select troops), the governor of the Hejaz (western Arabia) in 692–694, and the practical viceroy of a unified Iraqi province and the eastern parts of the Caliphate in 694. Al-Hajjaj retained the last post under Abd al-Malik&#x27;s son and successor al-Walid I (), whose decision-making was heavily influenced by al-Hajjaj, until his death in 714. 

As governor of Iraq and the east, al-Hajjaj instituted key reforms. Among these were the minting of silver dirhams with strictly Muslim religious formulas instead of the coins&#x27; traditional, pre-Islamic Sasanian design; changing the language of the (tax registers) of Iraq from Persian to Arabic; and the introduction of a uniform version of the Quran. To revive agricultural production and increase tax revenue, al-Hajjaj expelled non-Arab, Muslim converts from the garrison cities of Kufa and Basra to their villages of origin and collected from them the (poll tax) nominally reserved for non-Muslim subjects, and oversaw large-scale canal digging projects. In 701, al-Hajjaj, with reinforcements from Syria, crushed a mass rebellion led by the Kufan Arab nobleman Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath whose ranks spanned the Arab troops, Muslim converts and religious elites of Iraq. Consequently, al-Hajjaj further tightened control over the province, founding the city of Wasit to house the loyalist Syrian troops whom he thereafter relied on to enforce his rule. 

Al-Hajjaj was a highly capable though ruthless governor, strict in character, and a harsh and demanding master. Widely feared by his contemporaries, he became a deeply controversial figure and an object of deep-seated enmity among later, pro-Abbasid writers, who ascribed to him persecutions and mass executions.

==Ancestry==
Al-Hajjaj was born in ca. 661 in the city of Ta&#x27;if in the Hejaz (western Arabia, where Mecca and Medina are located). He belonged to the family of Abu Aqil, called after al-Hajjaj&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather. The family was part of the Banu Awf branch of the Thaqif tribe. Members of the Thaqif attained high military and administrative ranks in the nascent Caliphate and played important command and economic roles during and after the early Muslim conquests, particularly in Iraq. The tribe&#x27;s political influence continued to grow with the advent of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661. Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s ancestry was not particularly distinguished: the Abu Aqil family was poor and its members had worked as stone carriers and builders. His mother, al-Fari&#x27;a, had been married and divorced by al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba, a member of the Thaqif who was appointed governor of Kufa by the first Umayyad caliph, Mu&#x27;awiya I ().

==Early life and career==
As a boy, al-Hajjaj acquired the nickname (&#x27;little dog&#x27;), with which he was later derisively referred to. His early life is obscure, except for his having been a schoolmaster in his hometown—another source of derision to his enemies—where he taught his pupils to copy and recite the Quran. His father Yusuf ibn al-Hakam and elder brother Muhammad were also teachers in Ta&#x27;if. 

After a short, undetermined period, al-Hajjaj and his father left their teaching jobs and took up military service under Caliph Yazid I (), who was facing increasing opposition to his rule in the Hejaz. He participated in the Second Muslim Civil War, fighting in the battles of al-Harra (682) and of al-Rabadha (684)—both near Medina—but without distinction. At al-Harra, where a Syrian army dispatched by Yazid defeated the local defenders of Medina who had discarded the Caliph&#x27;s authority, al-Hajjaj fought in the brigade of Hubaysh ibn Dulja al-Qayni. He fled the field in that engagement. According to verses compiled in the 10th-century (Book of songs), al-Hajjaj acknowledged: &quot;I took to flight ... but later, I made good my fault by renewing the attack. For a sheikh takes to flight only once&quot;. He and his father were among the few to survive the battle at al-Rabadha, where Hubaysh, the commander of the expedition, was slain fighting forces loyal to the Mecca-based anti-Umayyad caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s first public post, as governor of Tabala in the Tihama region south of Ta&#x27;if, was unremarkable. Al-Hajjaj abandoned the post, considering it beneath his ambition. An Arabic proverb later developed out of this anecdote: (&quot;as insignificant as Tabala is to al-Hajjaj&quot;). 

Soon after Abd al-Malik () acceded to the caliphate, al-Hajjaj left his hometown and went to the Umayyad capital, Damascus, where he entered the (select troops) of the Caliph. However, according to a different account, by Ibn Qutayba (d. 889), al-Hajjaj started his career in the of Aban ibn Marwan, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s half-brother and one-time governor of Palestine. The commander of the , the Caliph&#x27;s main adviser Rawh ibn Zinba al-Judhami, was impressed with al-Hajjaj&#x27;s military capabilities and thinking. Upon Rawh&#x27;s recommendation, Abd al-Malik appointed al-Hajjaj to enforce the Caliph&#x27;s authority over a large army he mobilized for an expedition against the Zubayrid ruler of Iraq, Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s brother Mus&#x27;ab, in 689/90. The Caliph was satisfied by the rapidity and efficiency with which al-Hajjaj restored discipline during a mutiny by the troops. During Abd al-Malik&#x27;s siege of the rebel leader of the Qays tribes of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, in al-Qariqisiya in the summer of 691, al-Hajjaj was sent as an emissary of the Caliph alongside the theologian Raja ibn Haywa to negotiate a peace with Zufar.

As a result of his success suppressing the Caliph&#x27;s mutinous troops, Abd al-Malik entrusted al-Hajjaj with command of the army&#x27;s rear-guard. He achieved further feats of valour, so that after the defeat of Mus&#x27;ab at the Battle of Maskin, Abd al-Malik entrusted him to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca. In late 691 he set out from Kufa at the head of 2,000 Syrian troops. After taking over Ta&#x27;if unopposed, he halted there as Abd al-Malik had charged him to try to secure Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s capitulation by diplomatic means if possible, and to avoid the shedding of blood in Mecca. Ibn al-Zubayr rejected the Umayyad offers, and al-Hajjaj, after receiving reinforcements and the Caliph&#x27;s permission, moved to attack Mecca. The Umayyad troops bombarded the city with catapults from Mount Abu Qubays, not letting up even during the Hajj pilgrimage; the Ka&#x27;aba was also targeted, despite the presence of the assembled pilgrims. When a sudden thunderstorm broke out, which his soldiers interpreted as divine wrath, he was able to rally them and convince them that it was actually a sign of victory. Finally, in October 692, after seven months of siege and the defection of several thousand of his supporters, including two of his sons, Ibn al-Zubayr was killed alongside his last remaining loyal followers, fighting around the Ka&#x27;aba.

As a reward, Abd al-Malik gave al-Hajjaj the governorship of the Hejaz, Yemen, and al-Yamama (central Arabia). As governor, al-Hajjaj led the Hajj in person in the years 73 and 74 AH (693 and 694 CE), and restored the Ka&#x27;aba to the shape and dimensions it had originally, rejecting the alterations made by Ibn al-Zubayr following the first Umayyad siege in 683. Al-Hajjaj was able to restore peace in the Hejaz, but his severity occasioned the frequent personal intervention of the Caliph.

==Viceroy of Iraq and the East==
In early 694, Abd al-Malik sent al-Hajjaj to govern Iraq. This involved combining the governorships of Kufa and Basra, which had not been done since the days of Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan twenty years earlier. The caliph had previously appointed his brother Bishr ibn Marwan governor of Kufa, but this &quot;experiment in family rule&quot; (Hugh N. Kennedy) had not been a success and when he died in early 694, al-Hajjaj, whose ability and loyalty had been amply demonstrated, was appointed to the crucial office. The governorship of Iraq was indeed &quot;the most important and responsible administrative post of the Islamic state&quot; (A. Dietrich), as it comprised not only Iraq proper, but also included the lands conquered by troops from the two &#x27;garrison towns&#x27; () of Kufa and Basra, i.e. Persia, Khurasan and the other eastern provinces of the Caliphate. The governor of Iraq was therefore in charge of a huge super-province or vice-royalty stretching from Mesopotamia to the still expanding borders in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, comprising half of the Caliphate&#x27;s territory and producing more than half its income. In addition, the post was of particular political sensitivity due to the long history of Kharijism and political dissent in Iraq, particularly in Kufa. This discontent was driven by various tribal, economic, and political factors. The population of Kufa contained people from almost all Arab tribes, but also many of those undesired elsewhere, such as the vanquished of the Ridda wars. Although it dominated the fertile lands of the Sawad, many of these were assigned by the Umayyads to princes of the dynasty, while the average Kufan was given land as a stipend for military service; but as the size of the stipend was determined by the earliness of conversion to Islam, many received only minuscule grants. Finally, the Kufans were largely left out of the spoils of conquest in the East; it was the Basrans who secured the lion&#x27;s share, taking over far more extensive and richer territory like Khurasan or Sindh, while the Kufans were left with the mountains of Jibal and central Persia as their city&#x27;s sole dependencies. Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s purview originally excluded Khurasan and Sistan, which were governed by the largely ineffectual Umayyad prince Umayya ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, but in 697/8 he received these two provinces as well, expanding his rule over the entire eastern half of the Caliphate. He remained in this post until his death in 714, and throughout this period, encompassing the remainder of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign and most of that of his successor al-Walid I (), he would be &quot;the dominant feature in the sources&quot; (G. R. Hawting).

===Relations with the caliphs===
Al-Hajjaj was, in the words of A. Dietrich, &quot;the most loyal servant that a dynasty could wish for&quot;, and his loyalty was reciprocated by Abd al-Malik with his full trust. The relationship was further strengthened through family ties: al-Hajjaj&#x27;s daughter wed Masrur, a son of al-Walid, while the daughter of his brother Muhammad was wed to the future caliph Yazid II (); the latter named his first-born son after al-Hajjaj, who in turn named three of his sons after members of the dynasty. Abd al-Malik also named one of his sons al-Hajjaj. This close relationship is further evidenced by the many surviving letters exchanged between al-Hajjaj and Abd al-Malik. Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s relationship with the latter was much different than with al-Walid, with whom the correspondence was restricted to their official functions. On the other hand, while Abd al-Malik was able to restrain his over-zealous governor whenever he was &quot;extortionate in the raising of taxes, was too liberal with public resources, or was shedding more blood than was necessary&quot; (A. Dietrich), al-Walid considered himself in al-Hajjaj&#x27;s debt because he had championed the succession of al-Walid against Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brother Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, and the new Caliph allowed his powerful governor free rein and relied heavily on his counsel even in the appointment and dismissal of officials. If his meddling in the succession had secured him the favour of al-Walid, it had also caused the declared enmity of al-Walid&#x27;s brother Sulayman (). Sulayman furthermore had championed the cause of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom al-Hajjaj had imprisoned. The possibility of Sulayman&#x27;s accession so frightened al-Hajjaj that he wished not to outlive al-Walid.

===Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s revolt and aftermath===
Arriving at Kufa, al-Hajjaj gave an inaugural sermon at the local mosque that has become famous and is &quot;often cited as an example of Arab eloquence&quot; (G. R. Hawting). The situation he found there was one of disorder. The troops of Basra and Kufa, ostensibly garrisoned at Ramhurmuz under al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra had instead, upon the death of Bishr, left the camp and were idling in the cities. In order to restore discipline, al-Hajjaj announced that any man who did not within three days return to the camp would be put to death and his property be left open to plunder. This proved effective, but when he went to the troops to distribute the pay, al-Hajjaj faced another mutiny under Ibn al-Jarud for making pay cuts that the troops refused to accept. These problems overcome, al-Hajjaj sent the troops against the Kharijites. In 696 al-Muhallab defeated the Azariqa who had rallied around Qatari ibn al-Fuja&#x27;a as their anti-caliph, and in spring 697 another Kharijite leader, Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani, was defeated on the Dujayl river in Khuzistan with the aid of Syrian troops. In the same year, al-Hajjaj suppressed the rebellion of the governor of Mada&#x27;in, al-Mutarrif ibn al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba, who had allied with the Kharijites.

These campaigns eradicated the Kharijite rebellion, but came at a cost to his relationship with the Iraqis: the campaigns against the Kharijites were extremely unpopular, and measures like the reductions in pay, according to Kennedy, &quot;[seem] almost to have goaded the Iraqis into rebellion, as if looking for an excuse to break them&quot;. The explosion came in 699: when he had been conferred the governorships of Khurasan and Sistan, al-Hajjaj had given it to al-Muhallab, but in Sistan, the situation was far more unstable, and the country had to be essentially reconquered. An army under the local governor Ubayd Allah ibn Abi Bakra had suffered a heavy defeat against the ruler of the kingdom of Zabulistan, known as the Zunbil, and now al-Hajjaj ordered Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath, the most pre-eminent member of the Kufan aristocracy (the ) to lead an army against the Zunbil. This army was drawn from the Kufan soldiery, and such was the splendour of its equipment, or perhaps the &quot;proud and haughty manner of the Kufan soldiers and who composed it&quot; (Hawting), that it became known in history as the &quot;Peacock Army&quot;. This expedition marked the beginning of a rebellion that came close to destroying not only al-Hajjaj&#x27;s, but also Umayyad, power in Iraq.

Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath led his army to Sistan, and, as Dietrich writes, &quot;at first carried out his campaign carefully and according to orders; he pacified each territory as it was conquered, ensured supplies and accustomed his troops gradually to the different climatic conditions&quot;. Al-Hajjaj, however, sent letter after letter to his commander, demanding an immediate assault against the Zunbil. The tone of these letters was extremely offensive, and he threatened to dismiss Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath and appoint his brother Ishaq to command the expedition instead. Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s harsh tone and unreasonable demands, as well as the army&#x27;s evident reluctance to continue such a protracted and arduous campaign so far from their homes, provoked a widespread mutiny, led by Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath. The rebel army marched back to Iraq, growing to over 100,000 strong in the process as they were joined by other malcontents. It transformed from a mutiny against al-Hajjaj—denounced as an enemy of God and a latter-day Pharaoh—to a full-blown anti-Umayyad movement.

Al-Hajjaj tried to stop the rebels at Tustar, but the rebels were victorious (early 701). Al-Hajjaj abandoned Basra to the rebels, and Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath entered the city in triumph. Reinforced with Syrian troops, al-Hajjaj managed to score a minor victory, after which the bulk of the rebel army left Basra for their natural stronghold, Kufa. Al-Hajjaj recaptured Basra and pursued Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath to Kufa, encamping near the city. Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s progress had sufficiently alarmed the Umayyad court that they sought a negotiated settlement, even though they kept sending Syrian reinforcements to al-Hajjaj. Abd al-Malik offered to dismiss al-Hajjaj, appoint Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath as governor over one of the Iraqi towns, and raise the Iraqis&#x27; pay so that they received the same amount as the Syrians. Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath was inclined to accept, but the more radical of his followers, especially the scholars known as , refused, believing that the offered terms revealed the government&#x27;s weakness, and pushed for outright victory. The two armies met in the Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim in April 701, and al-Hajjaj and his more disciplined Syrians scored a crushing victory. Kufa surrendered afterward, and al-Hajjaj further undercut Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s support by promising amnesty to those who surrendered, providing however that they acknowledged that their rebellion had been tantamount to renouncing Islam; those who refused were executed. The remnants of the rebel army fled to Basra, but were soon evicted and pursued by the Syrians to Khuzistan and Sistan. There Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath sought refuge with the Zunbil, but was either assassinated by the latter or committed suicide to avoid being surrendered to al-Hajjaj. Most of his remaining followers tried to reach Herat, but were defeated by al-Muhallab&#x27;s son, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, who surrendered those of north Arab provenance (Mudaris) but let the southern Arab (Yamani) go.

The failure of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s revolt led to the tightening of Umayyad control over Iraq. In 702 al-Hajjaj founded the city of Wasit, situated midway between Basra and Kufa, where he moved his seat. There he gathered all Syrian troops present in Iraq, ostensibly in order to rein in the Syrians and prevent excess at the expense of the populace, but in reality his aim was to isolate the Syrians from the locals and solidify their loyalty to him. Henceforth, Iraq passed under virtual Syrian occupation, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. Al-Hajjaj was now the undisputed master not only of Iraq, but of the entire Islamic East; only the governor of Khurasan, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, retained some autonomy. Although Yazid was able to refuse several summons to Wasit, finally in 704 al-Hajjaj persuaded the Caliph to dismiss him, and Yazid was imprisoned.

===Campaigns of expansion===

As governor of Iraq and viceroy of the East, al-Hajjaj supervised a major wave of expansion. He appointed his kinsman Muhammad ibn al-Qasim al-Thaqafi to lead the conquest of Sindh (northwestern India), Qutayba ibn Muslim to conquer Transoxiana (Central Asia), and Mujja&#x27;a ibn Si&#x27;r to Oman. Although al-Hajjaj himself undertook no campaign during these years, his role was essential: not only did he select the generals who carried out these campaigns, but also &quot;prepared them very carefully, sparing no expense, since he calculated that with victory he would recover his expenses many times over&quot; (A. Dietrich).

The relationship between al-Hajjaj and Muhammad ibn al-Qasim has always been one of great debate. Many accounts list al-Hajjaj as being his uncle or father-in-law. According to the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;, the oldest chronicle of the Arab conquest of Sindh, the primary reason al-Hajjaj ordered an expedition against the region&#x27;s ruler Raja Dahir, was the pirate raid off the coast of Debal, resulting in the capturing of gifts to the caliph from the king of Serendib (modern Sri Lanka) as well as the female pilgrims on board who were captured. Upon hearing of the matter, al-Hajjaj wrote a letter to the Raja, and upon unsuccessful resolution being reached, launched a military attack. Other reasons attributed to al-Hajjaj&#x27;s interest was gaining a foothold in Makran(Balochistan) and Sindh, protecting the maritime interests of the caliphate, and punishing the armies of Sindh for participating alongside the Persians in various battles such as those at Salasal, Qadisiyya and Nahawand and also the granting of refuge to fleeing rebel chieftains.

===Domestic government and reforms===

Already in 695, al-Hajjaj began minting the new gold and silver coins, which superseded the Byzantine and Sasanian coins still used until then. He established mints at Kufa and later in Wasit and decreed strict punishments for counterfeiters. The new coins contained the name of Allah, and hence were initially opposed by many theologians who argued that they would also be used by non-muslims, but they quickly became a success and &quot;helped to promote the circulation of money and the stabilization of economic conditions&quot; (Dietrich). Al-Hajjaj also ordered the translation of the tax registers () into Arabic from the Persian in which it had hitherto been kept, so that he could supervise it personally.

Following his victory over the Iraqis, al-Hajjaj began a series of reforms aimed at restoring tranquility and prosperity to the troubled province after almost twenty years of civil war and rebellions. He invested much effort in reviving agriculture, especially in the Sawad, and thereby increasing revenue through the (land tax). He began to restore and expand the network of canals in lower Iraq. According to the 9th-century historian al-Baladhuri, he spared no expense to repair embankments when they broke, awarded uncultivated lands to deserving Arabs, and took measures to reverse the flow of the rural population to the cities, especially the new converts (). According to the 9th-century historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam, al-Hajjaj, with the support of Abd al-Malik, was the first to collect the jizya (poll tax) from the , despite its imposition being traditionally restricted to the non-Muslim subjects of the Caliphate. 

====Uniformity of the Quran and grammatical reforms====
As part of his efforts to strengthen uniformity in the state, he also tried to introduce a definitive, uniform version of the Quran so as to eliminate theological quarrels. Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s version also probably included new vowel diacritics. He declared this version to be the only valid one, while prohibiting the use of Ibn Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s (). On the other hand, a number of authors argue that it is difficult to assess any role had by al-Hajjaj, though they argue for the plausibility of a widely known account that has him ordering the grammarian and Nasr ibn Asim al-Laythi to introduce new vowel diacritics, a story that is unchallenged, despite the strong hostility of Muslim sources towards al-Hajjaj.

The orientalist Arthur Jeffery argued that al-Hajjaj seemed &quot;to have made an entirely new recension of the Qur&#x27;an&quot;, basing his argument on a Muslim source and two Christian sources. The Muslim source is a hadith report in Sunan Abu Dawood, which details eleven changes. Researcher Umar Ibn Ibrahim Radwan, argues that the changes could be categorised as differences in the . Doubting the authenticity of the hadith report, Radwan argues that the codex of Uthman, a caliph favored by al-Hajjaj, had already been memorised by thousands of Muslims and that the Abbasid dynasty, which was known for polemically showcasing the negative aspects of Umayyad rule, would have taken the opportunity to show that the Umayyads had corrupted the Quran. One of the Christian sources was a letter reported by the 8th-century Armenian priest Levond to have been written by the Byzantine emperor Leo III addressed to Caliph Umar II. Jefferey notes the authenticity of the letter is disputed by historians, including John Wansbrough, who denied that Levond had reported it. Neal Robinson argues that even if the letter was authentic, the activity of al-Hajjaj would have been limited to destroying sectarian writings and early codices which preserved the suras (Quranic chapters) in a different order. The other Christian source is an apologetic letter attributed to Abd al-Masih al-Kindi. The dating of the letter is disputed, the Arabist Paul Kraus concluding that its composition dated to the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, other authors have rejected that the letter had any factual basis, arguing that it was a polemical work.

According to the Islamic historical tradition, in , al-Hajjaj improved written Arabic by adding diacritical marks to the bare (&#x27;script&#x27;) of early &quot;defective&quot; Arabic so that consonants such as these five letters ـبـ ـتـ ـثـ ـنـ ـيـ (y, n, th, t, b) could be distinguished from one another. However, some historians believe these language reforms occurred earlier in Syria or Iraq before the advent of Islam.

==Death and legacy==
Al-Hajjaj died in Wasit in May or June 714 at the age of 53 or 54. On his deathbed, he appointed his son Abd Allah to replace him as leader of the Friday prayers. He penned a letter to al-Walid, which concluded as follows:When I meet God and find favour with Him, therein shall be the joy of my soul. The eternity of God sufficeth me, and I therefore place not my hopes on mortals. Those who were before us have tasted of death, and after them we also shall taste it.

The cause of his death, according to the 13th-century historian Ibn Khallikan, was a stomach cancer. The following year, al-Walid died as well, and his brother Sulayman came to power. As the heir apparent, Sulayman had allied with many of al-Hajjaj&#x27;s opponents, particularly Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he appointed governor of Iraq just after his accession. Possibly having been convinced by such allies that al-Hajjaj had provoked hatred among the Iraqis toward the Umayyads as opposed to fostering their loyalty, the caliph deposed the late viceroy&#x27;s appointees and allies in the province and throughout the eastern Caliphate. This was likely due to their connection with al-Hajjaj personally. Among those who fell from grace was Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, who was dismissed from his governorship of Sindh and executed in Wasit.

In the assessment of the historian Julius Wellhausen, al-Hajjaj was &quot;harsh and at times hard, but not cruel; neither was he petty or bigoted&quot;. Though he was criticized in the early Muslim sources for his bombardment of Mecca and the Ka&#x27;aba during his siege of Ibn al-Zubayr, &quot;other shameful deeds&quot; al-Hajjaj was held responsible for are the &quot;inventions and fabrications of the hatred of his enemies&quot;. Among these was a charge by an anonymous source recorded by al-Tabari that al-Hajjaj massacred between 11,000 and 130,000 men in Basra following his suppression of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s revolt, in contrast to the older traditional Muslim sources, which held that al-Hajjaj granted a general pardon in Kufa and Basra after his victory for rebels who renounced Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath.

==Family==
Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s first wife was Umm Aban, a daughter of Nu&#x27;man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, an aide of Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya and onetime governor of Kufa. Before being appointed governor of Iraq, he was also wed to another daughter of Nu&#x27;man, Hamida, after she had been divorced by Rawh ibn Zinba; al-Hajjaj divorced Hamida during his governorship in Iraq. During his governorship of Medina, al-Hajjaj married Umm al-Julas, a daughter of Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, a member of the Umayyad dynasty. This followed his divorce of Umm Kulthum bint Abd Allah ibn Ja&#x27;far, a grandniece of Caliph Ali (). While al-Mas&#x27;udi holds al-Hajjaj divorced Umm Kulthum to humiliate the family of Abu Talib (the father of Ali), accounts recorded in the and by Ibn Abd Rabbihi and Ibn al-Athir hold that Abd al-Malik ordered al-Hajjaj to divorce her and return her dowry after petitions by her father and the Umayyad prince Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya; the modern historian Shiv Rai Chowdhry argues the latter account is more credible. During his rule in Iraq, al-Hajjaj married Hind, a daughter of al-Muhallab, but according to the historian al-Tabari, divorced her in 708/09 because she cried audibly at the torture of her brother Yazid in al-Hajjaj&#x27;s prison. With his marriage to Umm Banin bint al-Mughira ibn Abd al-Rahman, a great-granddaughter of al-Harith ibn Hisham, al-Hajjaj became one of the few non-Qurayshites to marry into the aristocratic Banu Makhzum clan; two of his sons also married into the clan.

According to the historian Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), al-Hajjaj had four sons: his eldest Muhammad, and Abd al-Malik, Aban and Sulayman (or al-Walid). The latter three were named after members of the Umayyad dynasty. Al-Tabari mentions a son named Abd Allah. Muhammad died during al-Hajjaj&#x27;s lifetime and his descendants were recorded living in Damascus as late as the 9th century. Abd al-Malik also had descendants recorded living in the 9th century, in Basra, while Aban and Sulayman (or al-Walid) died without progeny.

<doc id="433743" wikidata="Q56312" url="?curid=433743" title="Marwari language">
<text>Marwari (, , ) is a Western Indo-Aryan language within the group of Rajasthani languages. Marwari and its closely related varieties like Dhundhari, Shekhawati and Mewari form a part of the broader Rajasthani language family. It is spoken in the Indian state of Rajasthan, as well as the neighbouring states of Gujarat and Haryana, some adjacent areas in eastern parts of Pakistan, and some migrant communities in Nepal. There are two dozen varieties of Marwari.

Marwari is popularly written in Devanagari script, as are many languages of India and Nepal, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and Sanskrit; although it was historically written in Mahajani, it is still written in the Perso-Arabic script by the Marwari minority in Eastern parts of Pakistan (the standard/western Naskh script variant is used in Sindh Province, and the eastern Nastalik variant is used in Punjab Province), where it has educational status but where it is rapidly shifting to Urdu.

Marwari has no official status in India and is not used as a language of education. Marwari is still spoken widely in Jodhpur, Pali, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Nagaur, Bikaner.

== History ==
It is believed that Marwari and Gujarati evolved from &quot;Old Western Rajasthani&quot; or &quot;Dingal&quot;. Formal grammar of Gurjar Apabhraṃśa was written by Jain monk and Gujarati scholar Hemachandra Suri.

== Geographical distribution ==
Marwari is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Marwari speakers have dispersed widely throughout India and other countries but are found most notably in the neighbouring state of Gujarat and in Eastern Pakistan. Speakers are also found in Bhopal. With around 7.9 million speakers in India according to the 2001 census.

Some dialects of Marwari are:


== Lexis ==
Indian Marwari [rwr] in Rajasthan shares a 50%–65% lexical similarity with Hindi (this is based on a Swadesh 210 word list comparison). It has many cognate words with Hindi. Notable phonetic correspondences include /s/ in Hindi with /h/ in Marwari. For example, /sona/ &#x27;gold&#x27; (Hindi) and /hono/ &#x27;gold&#x27; (Marwari).

Pakistani Marwari [mve] shares 87% lexical similarity between its Southern subdialects in Sindh (Utradi, Jaxorati, and Larecha) and Northern subdialects in Punjab (Uganyo, Bhattipo, and Khadali), 79%–83% with Dhakti [mki], and 78% with Meghwar and Bhat Marwari dialects. Mutual intelligibility of Pakistani Marwari [mve] with Indian Marwari [rwr] is decreasing due to the rapid shift of active speakers in Pakistan to Urdu, their use of the Arabic script and different sources of support medias, and their separation from Indian Marwaris, even if there are some educational efforts to keep it active (but absence of official recognition by Pakistani or provincial government level). Many words have been borrowed from other Pakistani languages.

Merwari [wry] shares 82%–97% intelligibility of Pakistani Marwari [mve], with 60%–73% lexical similarity between Merwari varieties in Ajmer and Nagaur districts, but only 58%–80% with Shekhawati [swv], 49%–74% with Indian Marwari [rwr], 44%–70% with Godwari [gdx], 54%–72% with Mewari [mtr], 62%–70% with Dhundari [dhd], 57%–67% with Haroti [hoj]. Unlike Pakistani Marwari [mve], the use of Merwari remains vigorous, even if its most educated speakers also proficiently speak Hindi [hin].
==Phonology==
*Nasalization of vowels is phonemic, all of the vowels can be nasalized.
*Diphthongs are /ai, ia, ae, əi, ei, oi, ui, ua, uo/
*Implosives are mostly only found word initially and it formed due to the influence of neighbouring languages.
*// is [] before front vowels and [] elsewhere e.g. [ʋɪwwa] &#x27;marriage&#x27;.

== Morphology ==
Marwari languages have a structure that is quite similar to Hindustani (Hindi or Urdu). Their primary word order is subject–object–verb Most of the pronouns and interrogatives used in Marwari are distinct from those used in Hindi; at least Marwari proper and Harauti have a clusivity distinction in their plural pronouns.

== Vocabulary ==

Marwari vocabulary is somewhat similar to other Western Indo-Aryan languages, especially Rajasthani and Gujarati, however, elements of grammar and basic terminology differ enough to significantly impede mutual intelligibility.

== Writing system ==
Marwari is generally written in the Devanagari script, although the Mahajani script is traditionally associated with the language. In Pakistan it is written in the Perso-Arabic script with modifications. Historical Marwari orthography for Devanagari uses other characters in place of standard Devanagari letters.

<doc id="433751" wikidata="Q804704" url="?curid=433751" title="Balbriggan">
<text>Balbriggan (; , ) is a coastal town in Fingal, in the northern part of the traditional County Dublin, Ireland. It is approximately 34 km north of the city of Dublin, for which it is a commuter town. The 2022 census population was 24,322 for Balbriggan and its environs, the 17th largest urban area in Ireland. The town formerly had an active textile industry, and was the site of a major episode in the Irish War of Independence.
== Etymology ==
According to P. W. Joyce, the name arises from &quot;Baile Breacain&quot; [sic], which literally means &quot;Brecan&#x27;s Town&quot;. Brecan is a common medieval first name and there are several other Brackenstowns in Ireland. There is also a possible link to the local Bracken River, in which case the name could derive from &quot;breicín,&quot; meaning &quot;little trout&quot;.

Many locals, however, have traditionally felt that &quot;Baile Brigín&quot; means &quot;Town of the Little Hills&quot;, due to the relatively low hills that surround the town. Although this is now the official Irish name for the town, it is likely to be a folk etymology, back-formed from the English name. Following linguistic logic, however, both with vowels and syllabic stress, this would presume an English name closer to Ballybrig(g)een.

The town&#x27;s name is more likely derived from the word &quot;brecan&quot;, as the area was part of a medieval kingdom known as &quot;Brega&quot;, populated by a tribe or clan known as the &quot;Bregii&quot;, and the aforementioned River Bracken.

== History ==
There is no consensus about when the foundation of the town occurred, other than there may always have been a small settlement of fishermen, weavers and some sort of agricultural trade post.

=== Medieval battle ===
According to Ware, a medieval annalist, a battle took place at Balbriggan on Whitsun-eve, 1329, between the combined forces of John de Bermingham, Earl of Louth (who had been elevated to the &#x27;palatine dignity&#x27; of the county) and Richard, Lord of Malahide, and several of their kinsmen, and the forces of local rival families, the Verduns, Gernons and Savages, who were opposed to the elevation of the earl. In this event, the former, with 60 of their English followers, were killed.

=== 18th century ===
An 18th-century traveller described Balbriggan as &quot;... a small village situated in a small glin [glen] where the sea forms a little harbour – it is reckoned safe and is sheltered by a good pier. The village is resorted to in Summertime by several genteel people for the benefit of bathing&quot;.

Balbriggan rose from a small fishing village to a place of manufacturing and commercial importance in part due to local landowner and judge George Hamilton, Baron of the Court of Exchequer, who, in 1780, established factories to aid in the manufacturing of cotton. He also improved the harbour by building the pier, which was completed in 1763.

=== 19th century ===

Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Directory of Ireland&quot;, from 1837, refers to Balbriggan as follows:

A seaport, market and post village and a chapelry, in the parish and barony of Balrothery, county of Dublin, and province of Leinster, 15 miles (N. by E.) from Dublin; containing 3,016 inhabitants.
The inhabitants are partly employed in the fishery, but principally in the manufacture of cotton; there are two large factories, the machinery of which is worked by steam-engines and water-wheels of the aggregate power of 84 horses, giving motion to 7,500 spindles, and spinning upon the average about . of cotton yarn per week. More than 300 persons are employed in these factories, to which are attached blue dye-works; and in the village and neighbourhood are 942 hand-looms employed in the weaving department. The principal articles made at present are checks, jeans, calicoes and fustians. The village is also celebrated for the manufacture of the finest cotton stockings, which has been carried on successfully since its first establishment about 40 years since; there are 60 frames employed in this trade, and the average production is about 60 dozen per week. There are on the quay a large corn store belonging to Messrs. Frost &amp; Co., of Chester, and some extensive salt-works; and in the village is a tanyard.
The fishery, since the withdrawing of the bounty, has very much diminished: there are at present only 10 wherries or small fishing boats belonging to the port. The village carries on a tolerably brisk coasting trade: in 1833, 134 coal vessels, of the aggregate burden of 11,566 tons, and 29 coasting vessels of 1,795 tons, entered inwards, and 17 coasters of 1,034 tons cleared outwards, from and to ports in Great Britain. The harbour is rendered safe for vessels of 150 tons&#x27; burden by an excellent pier, completed in 1763, principally by Baron Hamilton, aided by a parliamentary grant, and is a place of refuge for vessels of that burden at 3/4 tide. A jetty or pier, long from the N. W. part of the harbour, with a curve of in a western direction, forming an inner harbour in which at high tide is of water, and affording complete shelter from all winds, was commenced in 1826 and completed in 1829, at an expense of £2,912–7s–9d, of which the late Fishery Board gave £1,569, the Marquess of Lansdowne £100, and the remainder was subscribed by the late Rev. Geo. Hamilton, proprietor of the village. At the end of the old pier there is a lighthouse.

The Drogheda or Grand Northern Trunk railway from Dublin, for which an act has been obtained, is intended to pass along the shore close to the village and to the east of the church. The market is on Monday, and is abundantly supplied with corn, of which great quantities are sent to Dublin and to Liverpool; and there is a market for provisions on Saturday. Fairs are held on the 29th of April and September, chiefly for cattle. A market house was erected in 1811, partly by subscription and partly at the expense of the Hamilton family. The village is the headquarters of the constabulary police force of the county; and near it is a Martello tower with a coast guard station, which is one of the nine stations within the district of Swords. Petty sessions for the northeast division of the county are held here every alternate Tuesday.

The chapelry of St. George, Balbriggan was founded by the late Rev. G. Hamilton, of Hampton Hall, who in 1813 granted some land and settled an endowment, under the 11th and 12th of Geo. III., for the establishment of a perpetual curacy; and augmentation of £25 per annum has been recently granted by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from Primate Boulter&#x27;s fund. In 1816 a chapel was completed, at an expense of £3,018–2s–2d, of which £1,400 was given by the late Board of First Fruits, £478-15s–2d., was raised by voluntary subscriptions of the inhabitants and £1,139-7s–0d., was given by the founder and his family. This chapel, which was a handsome edifice with a square embattled tower, and contained monuments to the memory of R. Hamilton, Esq., and the Rev. G. Hamilton, was burned by accident in 1835, and the congregation assembled for divine service in a school-room until it shall be restored, for which purpose the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have lately granted £480. The living is in the patronage of G. A. Hamilton, Esq.
There is a chapel belonging to the R.C. Union or district of Balrothery and Balbriggan, also a place of worship for Wesleyan Methodists. A parochial school and dispensary are in the village.

==== Milling ====
Balbriggan was the location of the 19th century Smith&#x27;s Stocking Mill, which made stockings as well as men&#x27;s &quot;Long-Johns&quot; called Balbriggans. These are often mentioned in John Wayne films – &#x27;he put his balbriggans on&#x27; – and both Queen Victoria and the Czarina of Russia also wore &quot;Balbriggans&quot;. Balbriggan&#x27;s strong textile connections also include the linen &amp; cotton manufacturing of Charles Gallen &amp; Company, which in 1870, purchased the existing weaving mill and associated facilities built by Baron Hamilton. The firm became famous as the finest linen weavers in Ireland and had customers all over the world. They were also suppliers of linens to the Vatican, Embassies of Ireland and the US, and fine hotels worldwide. The business continues today from another location as the old mill in the town centre has been redeveloped.

=== Sack of Balbriggan ===
During the Irish War of Independence, members of the Black and Tans (former British soldiers recruited into the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) as special constables) stationed at the nearby Gormanston Camp attacked Balbriggan in reprisal for the murder of an RIC policeman on 20 September 1920. The event, known as the sack of Balbriggan, resulted in the destruction of 54 houses and a hosiery factory along with the looting of four pubs by the Black and Tans. Two residents of Balbriggan, dairyman Séamus Lawless and barber Sean Gibbons, were bayoneted to death by the Black and Tans during the attack. After it occurred, the attack received international attention due to Balbriggan&#x27;s close proximity to foreign news correspondents based in Dublin. A delegation from the United States pledged to rebuild thirty homes in the village and a local factory.

== Location and access ==
Balbriggan is 32 km north of Dublin city, in the northern part of the traditional County Dublin. It lies on the Belfast–Dublin main line of the Irish rail network. Commuter rail services serve Balbriggan railway station, which opened on 25 May 1844 and closed for goods traffic on 2 December 1974. It is estimated that about 2,200 commuters use the station every working day.

The town is also located next to the M1 motorway (the section known as the Balbriggan Bypass), which was completed in 1998. Prior to this, the main Dublin-Belfast road went through the centre of the town, with major traffic congestion on a daily basis. There are three exits from the motorway, allowing you to enter from the North, South or West of the town.

Bus service is provided by Dublin Bus routes 33, 33A (taken over by Go-Ahead Ireland on 2 December 2018) and 33X as well as Bus Éireann routes 101 (Dublin-Drogheda) and B1 (Balbriggan Town service).

It is the most northerly town in Fingal (although the village of Balscadden lies further north within the county), and is situated close to Bettystown, Laytown (County Meath) and Drogheda (County Louth).

Balbriggan experienced a population boom in the early part of the 2000s as a result of the large demand for housing within the wider Dublin region. The population has increased as a result, with hundreds of new homes being built.

== Geography ==
The River Bracken, also known as the Matt River, which flows through the town, once formed a lake known locally as &quot;the Canal&quot; or &quot;Head&quot;(of water). The water was sluiced through a canal and tunnels down to the Lower Mill where it turned a waterwheel to drive the cotton manufacturing machinery. The retaining wall of the reservoir collapsed in the 1960s and the area was reclaimed with land-fill in the early 1980s to create a public park.

On the northern edge of the town, the small Bremore River comes to the sea just beyond the Martello Tower.

== Amenities ==

The town is coastal and has a sandy beach. It was, at one time, a holiday destination for people from Dublin city.

Balbriggan is also the location of a Sunshine Home which aims to provide a holiday to underprivileged children from the Greater Dublin area. The home is operated by the Sunshine Fund, a unique branch of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul which provides week-long summer breaks for children aged 7 to 11 from disadvantaged parts of Dublin, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare. The purpose-built home has hosted these holidays since 1935, with over 100,000 young people having passed through their doors.

== Economy ==
The Department of Foreign Affairs has located a passport production facility in Balbriggan. There is also a proposal to relocate the Drogheda International Seaport to the Bremore Port area to the north of the town. Local development bodies expect that the proposed Bremore Port and orbital motorway projects, as well as the existing M1 motorway and Belfast – Dublin railway, are major draws to prospective companies with large logistical sectors hoping to expand or set up in the Fingal area.

Wavin has been manufacturing plastic pipes in their purpose-built facility in Balbriggan since 1962.

=== Hosiery fabric===
Balbriggan was a well-known hosiery cloth manufacturer. A fine cotton fabric suitable for men&#x27;s underwear was named after the city. The city prospered as a result of the manufacture of the fabric.

<text>Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is an American lawyer and former politician who represented Virginia&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2014. A Republican, Cantor served as House Minority Whip from 2009 to 2011, and as House Majority Leader from 2011 to 2014.

Prior to serving in the House of Representatives, Cantor represented the 73rd district in the Virginia House of Delegates. His congressional district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond&#x27;s western suburbs, and until redistricting in 2013 also portions of the Shenandoah Valley.

In June 2014, in his bid for reelection, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that greatly surprised political analysts. In response, Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader. Several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect on August 18, 2014. Shortly thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis &amp; Company. At the time of his resignation, Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history and the only non-Christian Republican in either house.

==Early life, education, and career==
Cantor, the second of three children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Mary Lee (née Hudes), a schoolteacher, and Eddie Cantor, who owned a real estate firm. His family emigrated from Russia, Romania, and Latvia in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His father was the state treasurer for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1980 presidential campaign. Cantor was raised in Conservative Judaism.

He graduated from the Collegiate School, a co-ed private school in Richmond, in 1981. He enrolled at George Washington University (GW) in 1981; as a freshman he worked as an intern for House Republican Tom Bliley of Virginia, and was Bliley&#x27;s driver in the 1982 campaign. Cantor was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at GW and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1985. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from William &amp; Mary Law School in 1988, and received a Master of Science in Real Estate Development from Columbia University in 1989.

Cantor worked in his family&#x27;s real estate business before being elected to Congress.

==Virginia House of Delegates==
Cantor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1992 to January 1, 2001. At various times he was a member of committees on Science and Technology, Corporation Insurance and Banking, General Laws, Courts of Justice, (co-chairman) Claims. Cantor announced on March 14, 2000, that he would seek the seat in the United States House of Representatives that was being vacated by Tom Bliley. Cantor had chaired Bliley&#x27;s reelection campaigns for the previous six years, and immediately gained the support of Bliley&#x27;s political organization, as well as Bliley&#x27;s endorsement later in the primary. However, Cantor still faced an extremely spirited challenge in the primary and won that election by only a razor-thin margin of 263 votes out of over 40,000 cast. 

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
During his first term, Cantor was chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. He has also served on the House Financial Services Committee and on the House International Relations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.

===Party leadership===
In 2002, weeks after winning a second term, Cantor was appointed by Republican Whip Roy Blunt to be Chief Deputy Republican Whip, the highest appointed position in the Republican caucus.
On November 19, 2008, Cantor was unanimously elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, after serving as deputy whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt had decided not to seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members. Cantor became the majority leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011, after Republicans took back control of the House of Representatives. In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was the leader of the House Republicans.

Cantor was a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Republican National Committee. He is one of the Republican Party&#x27;s top fundraisers, having raised over $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). He is also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program. In the fall of 2010, Cantor wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book, &quot;Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders&quot;, with the other two founding members of Young Guns. They describe the vision outlined in the book as &quot;a clear agenda based on common sense for the common good&quot;. Cantor said in 2010 that he worked with the Tea Party movement in his district.

As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the House Rules Committee on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the October 2013 government shutdown began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution&#x27;s passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate&#x27;s continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate&#x27;s version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.

===Legislation===
Cantor was a strong supporter of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which he was the one to name in Gabriella Miller&#x27;s honor. The bill, which passed in both the House and the Senate, would end taxpayer contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and divert the money in that fund to pay for research into pediatric cancer through the National Institutes of Health. The total funding for research would come to $126 million over 10 years. As of 2014, the national conventions got about 23% of their funding from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. Cantor said that the bill &quot;clearly reflects Congressional priorities in funding: medical research before political parties and conventions&quot;.

==Political positions==
For much of his career in the House, Cantor was the only Jewish Republican in the United States Congress. He supports strong United States–Israel relations. He cosponsored legislation to cut off all U.S. taxpayer aid to the Palestinian Authority and another bill calling for an end to taxpayer aid to the Palestinians until they stop unauthorized excavations on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Responding to a claim by the State Department that the United States provides no direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, Cantor claimed that United States sends about US$75 million in aid annually to the Palestinian Authority, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He opposed a Congressionally approved three-year package of US$400 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority in 2000 and has also introduced legislation to end aid to the Palestinian territories.

In May 2008, Cantor said that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is not a &quot;constant sore&quot; but rather &quot;a constant reminder of the greatness of America&quot;, and following Barack Obama&#x27;s election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a &quot;stronger U.S.–Israel relationship&quot; remains a top priority for him and that he would be &quot;very outspoken&quot; if Obama &quot;did anything to undermine those ties.&quot; Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor&#x27;s office, he &quot;stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration&quot; and &quot;made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States.&quot; Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy; one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the president of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility &quot;that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American &#x27;without authority of the United States&#x27; to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government&#x27;s behavior on any disputes with the United States.&quot;

===Social issues===
Cantor opposed public funding of embryonic stem cell research and opposed elective abortion. He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record. He was opposed to same-sex marriage as of the mid-2000s, voting to Constitutionally define marriage as between a male and a female in 2006. In November 2007 he voted against prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also supported making flag burning illegal. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated him 19% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action voting record. He was opposed to gun control, voting to ban product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers in 2005, and he voted not to require gun registration and trigger-lock laws in the District of Columbia. He had a rating of &quot;A&quot; from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF). On November 2, 2010, Cantor told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that he would try to trim the federal deficit by reducing welfare.

===Economy, budgeting, and trade===
Cantor was a supporter of free trade, voting to promote trade with Peru, Chile, Singapore, and Australia. He also voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He voted against raising the minimum wage to US$7.25 in 2007. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), the largest federation of trade unions in the United States, rates Cantor 0%, indicating an anti-Union voting record.

In October 2008, Cantor advocated and voted for the TARP program which aided distressed banks.

On September 29, 2008, Cantor blamed Pelosi for what he felt was the failure of the $700 billion economic bailout bill. He noted that 94 Democrats voted against the measure, as well as 133 Republicans. Though supporting the Federal bailout of the nation&#x27;s largest private banks, he referred to Pelosi&#x27;s proposal to appoint a Car czar to run the US Automobile Industry Bailout as a &quot;bureaucratic&quot; imposition on private business.

The following February, Cantor led Republicans in the House of Representatives in voting against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and was a prominent spokesman in voicing the many issues he and his fellow Republicans had with the legislation. Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses, despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.

In his book &quot;Young Guns&quot;, Cantor summarized Keynesian economics with the following opinion, &quot;The idea is that the government can be counted on to spend more wisely than the people.&quot;

As majority leader, Cantor steered the STOCK Act through the House, which requires congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner. The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012. It was ultimately signed by President Obama on April 4, 2012. In July 2012, CNN reported that changes made by the House version of the legislation excluded reporting requirements by spouses and dependent children. Initially, Cantor&#x27;s office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act; however, when presented with new information from CNN, the majority leader&#x27;s office recognized that changes had unintentionally been made and offered technical corrections to fulfill the original intent of the legislation. These corrections were passed by Congress on August 3, 2012.

As majority leader, Cantor shepherded the JOBS Act through the House, which combined bipartisan ideas for economic growth – like crowdfunding for startups – into one piece of legislation. Ultimately, President Obama, Eric Cantor, Steve Case and other leaders joined together at the signing ceremony.

Cantor proposed initiatives which he purported would help small businesses grow, including
a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that employ fewer than 500 people.

===Other foreign affairs===
In an article he wrote for the &quot;National Review&quot; in 2007, he condemned Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s diplomatic visit to Syria, and her subsequent meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, whom he referred to as a &quot;dictator and terror-sponsor&quot;; saying that if &quot;Speaker Pelosi&#x27;s diplomatic foray into Syria weren&#x27;t so harmful to U.S. interests in the Middle East, it would have been laughable.&quot;

In 2014, Cantor criticized what he referred to as &quot;the isolationist sentiment&quot; and said that it was a mistake to withdraw from Iraq and had called for troops to remain in Afghanistan.

During the 2016 presidential election Cantor, a supporter of Israel, called on Donald Trump to be more consistent with his support for Israel.

==Political campaigns==
Cantor formerly represented Virginia&#x27;s 7th congressional district, which stretches from the western end of Richmond, through its suburbs, and northward to Page, Rappahannock Culpeper and parts of Spotsylvania, county. It also includes the towns of Mechanicsville and Laurel. The district has traditionally been strongly Republican; it had been in Republican hands since 1981 until 2018, when Cantor&#x27;s successor Dave Brat lost his re-election to Abigail Spanberger (it was numbered as the 3rd District prior to 1993).

===Virginia House of Delegates===
Cantor was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991, winning the race for the 73rd district seat unopposed. He was re-elected in 1993 with 79% of the vote. He won re-election in 1995, 1997, and 1999; in all three races he was unopposed.

===House of Representatives===
Cantor was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, succeeding retiring 20-year incumbent Republican Tom Bliley. He defeated the Democratic nominee, Warren A. Stewart, by nearly 100,000 votes. Cantor had won the closely contested Republican primary — the real contest in what was then one of the most Republican districts in Virginia — over state Senator Steve Martin by only 263 votes. During his first term, he was one of only two Jewish Republicans serving concurrently in the House of Representatives, the other being Ben Gilman of (R-NY). Gilman retired in 2002, leaving Cantor the sole Jewish Republican House member.

In 2002, Cantor was opposed by Democrat Ben Jones, an actor (who had played &quot;Cooter Davenport&quot; on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;) and a former congressman from Georgia.

In 2004, Cantor was opposed by Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 75.5% of the vote. In 2006, Cantor was opposed by Democrat James M. Nachman and Independent W. B. Blanton. Cantor won with 64% to Nachman&#x27;s 34% and Blanton&#x27;s 2%.

In August 2008, news reports surfaced that Cantor was being considered as John McCain&#x27;s Vice-Presidential running mate, with McCain&#x27;s representatives seeking documents from Cantor as part of its vetting process. The idea for Cantor to be McCain&#x27;s running mate was supported by conservative leaders like Richard Land and Erick Erickson. Cantor was not selected for the vice presidential nomination, and in his 2008 re-election campaign, Cantor defeated Democratic challenger Anita Hartke 63%–37%.

In 2010, Cantor was re-elected with 59% of the vote.

In 2012, Cantor faced a primary challenger, Floyd C. Bayne, in the June 12 Republican primary; Cantor won the primary with 79% of the vote and then defeated Democratic challenger Wayne Powell in the general election. Although he won with 58% of the vote, Cantor received his lowest vote percentage since being elected to Congress in 2000.

===2014 Republican primary and resignation===

On June 10, 2014, in a major upset, Cantor lost the Republican primary by 7,193 votes to Dave Brat, a Tea Party candidate and a professor at Randolph-Macon College. That made Cantor the first sitting House majority leader to lose a primary since the position was created in 1899. Internal campaign polls before the primary showed Cantor 30 points ahead of Brat, and he outspent Brat 40 to 1.

Cantor&#x27;s loss in the primary was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest political upsets of modern times.&quot; His loss was attributed to numerous factors including a moderating of his views after entering House leadership, being disconnected from his district, a lack of enthusiasm among his supporters, low turnout for the primary election, and support of Brat from radio talk show hosts.

Although the national media were shocked at Brat&#x27;s victory, Richmond-area media outlets had received signs well before the primary that Cantor was in trouble. The &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; reported two weeks before the primary that a number of Cantor&#x27;s constituents felt he took them for granted. The &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; also revealed that Cantor&#x27;s attempt to brand Brat as a liberal professor actually made more people turn out for Brat. &quot;The Chesterfield Observer,&quot; a local paper serving Chesterfield County—roughly half of which is in the 7th—reported that Tea-Party-aligned candidates had won several victories there, and at least one Cantor loyalist believed Tea Party supporters smelled &quot;blood in the water.&quot; One local reporter told David Carr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; that many constituents believed Cantor was arrogant and unapproachable. However, due to massive cutbacks, the race was severely under-polled by local media. Few Capitol Hill reporters were willing to go to Cantor&#x27;s district, for fear that they would be out of Washington in case a major story broke.

Following his primary defeat, Cantor announced his resignation as House Majority Leader effective on July 31 and declared that he would not run in the general election. In an interview with the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; that day, Cantor announced his resignation from Congress effective August 18 and said that he had asked Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a special election on November 4 to coincide with the 2014 general election.

In early September, advisory firm Moelis &amp; Company announced that it was appointing Eric Cantor as vice chairman and managing director and that he would be elected to the Moelis &amp; Company board of directors.

==Threats and campaign office incident==
After the passage of the health care reform bill in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia. A spokesman for the Richmond police later stated that the bullet was not intentionally fired at Cantor&#x27;s office, saying that it was instead random gunfire, as there were no signs outside the office identifying the office as being Cantor&#x27;s.
Cantor responded to this by saying that Democratic leaders in the House should stop &quot;dangerously fanning the flames&quot; by blaming Republicans for threats against House Democrats who voted for the health care legislation.

Cantor also reported that he had received threatening e-mails related to the passage of the bill. In March 2010, a person was arrested for making threats against Cantor and his family.

In 2011, Cantor received two threatening phone calls from a person who left &quot;screaming, profanity-laden messages [that] stated that he was going to destroy Cantor, rape his daughter and kill his wife.&quot; Swift was sentenced in April 2012 to 13 months in federal prison.

==Electoral history==
*Write-in candidate notes: In 2000, write-ins received 304 votes. In 2002, write-ins received 153 votes. In 2004, write-ins received 568 votes. In 2006, write-ins received 272 votes. In 2008, write-ins received 683 votes. In 2010, write-ins received 413 votes. In 2012, write-ins received 914 votes.
==Personal life==
Cantor met his wife, Diana Marcy Fine, on a blind date, and they were married in 1989. They have three children, Evan, Jenna, and Michael.

Diana Cantor is a lawyer, certified public accountant, and a managing director in a division of Emigrant Bank, a subsidiary of New York Private Bank &amp; Trust Corp. She founded, and from 1996 until 2008 was executive director of, the Virginia College Savings Plan (an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia). She was also chairman of the board of the College Savings Plans Network. Unlike her husband, she is a lifelong Democrat, favors abortion rights, and supports same-sex marriage.

<text>The North East Line (NEL) is a high-capacity Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore. Operated by ComfortDelGro&#x27;s SBS Transit, the line is the MRT&#x27;s shortest. It runs from HarbourFront station in southern Singapore to Punggol Coast station in the northeast, serving 17 stations via Chinatown, Little India, Serangoon and Hougang. Coloured purple on official maps, it is Singapore&#x27;s third MRT line and the world&#x27;s first fully-automated underground driverless heavy rail line.

The NEL was planned during the 1980s to alleviate traffic congestion on roads leading to the northeast suburbs of the country. However, the project was delayed due to a lack of demand at that time. After the government&#x27;s decision to go ahead with the project at an estimated cost of , its alignment and stations were finalised in 1996 and construction began the year after. The line began operations on 20 June 2003. Two mid-line stations initially did not open with the rest of the line; Buangkok station opened on 15 January 2006, and Woodleigh station began operations on 20 June 2011. A one-station extension to Punggol Coast station opened on 10 December 2024.

The driverless line uses the moving-block Alstom Urbalis 300 CBTC signalling system. Three types of Alstom rolling stock – C751A, C751C and C851E – run on the NEL, which is powered by an overhead line. The NEL is Singapore&#x27;s first Art-in-Transit line, with 19 artworks displayed across its 17 stations. The stations are wheelchair-accessible, and most of them are Civil Defence shelters designed to withstand airstrikes and chemical attacks.

==History==
===Planning===

The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) first proposed an additional MRT line serving the northeastern areas of Punggol and Jalan Kayu in September 1984. In its preliminary studies, the Communications Ministry concluded that existing roads would be inadequate for projected traffic into housing estates set to be built in the 21st century. To minimise the impact on other development, the Ministry developed plans to determine which parcels of land would be needed for the new MRT project. In December of that year, a British consultancy team consisting of Sir William Halcrow and Partners, Merz &amp; McLellan and London Transport International was appointed by the MRTC to look into possible routes for the line.

In March 1986, the British consultants drew up a tentative route from Outram Park to Punggol. The line would connect to the existing MRT system at Dhoby Ghaut station and pass through Kandang Kerbau and Hougang, paralleling the major Serangoon and Upper Serangoon Roads. A branch line from Hougang to Jalan Kayu was also proposed. The segment of the line in the city would be underground, and the northern portion after Braddell Road would be elevated.

The MRTC, which approved the project in October 1986, proposed that the line link to Bishan Depot (which would maintain and service its trains). In February 1991, a proposal was made to extend the line to Pulau Tekong via Pulau Ubin to serve future residential and industrial developments in the long-term plans for these islands.

===Delay===
Although the government approved the NEL &quot;in principle&quot; in January 1989, Communications Minister Yeo Ning Hong said that the line&#x27;s construction was dependent on development in the northeast. The Woodlands extension, which cost S$1.35 billion (US$ billion), took precedence over the S$4.3 billion (US$ billion) NEL. According to Yeo&#x27;s successor, Mah Bow Tan, there were firmer plans for development around the Woodlands extension, unlike in the northeast, where the low population meant that the NEL would not be as cost-effective. The four Members of Parliament (MPs) for the northeast called for the line to be built sooner, saying that there would be sufficient demand (given the area&#x27;s population) and it would relieve traffic congestion.

Reviewing the line&#x27;s feasibility, the Communications Ministry said in 1995 that the NEL could be completed in 2002 if construction began promptly. It was projected to cost S$5 billion (US$ billion) and would operate at a loss of S$250 million (US$ million) during its first four years, with lower daily passenger numbers (240,000). The ministry recommended the construction of the NEL to the Cabinet, citing &quot;wider benefits&quot; such as reduced travelling time and reliance on cars.

Mah, engaging with grassroots leaders in October 1995, said that residents would have to be prepared to pay higher fares on the NEL to cover the line&#x27;s cost and initial losses. His position was divisive; some leaders felt that it would be unfair to the residents, and others were confident that residents would be willing &quot;to pay for a better quality of life&quot;. Increased fares for the entire network were also suggested, but Mah said that it would be more difficult to implement. He assured leaders that he would recommend construction of the line to the government.

A white paper released on 2 January 1996 said that the NEL would be built earlier to address congestion in the northeast corridor, which would also be relieved by express bus service. The government&#x27;s announcement during a 19 January parliamentary debate on the report that it had decided to build the NEL &quot;immediately&quot; was greeted with applause.
===Construction and opening===


The 16 NEL stations and their locations were announced on 4 March 1996. Many residents and politicians welcomed the announcement, since the line was expected to relieve traffic congestion, improve transport in the northeast and stimulate development around the stations. Thirteen civil contracts for track work and construction of the stations, Sengkang Depot and associated tunnels were awarded for a total of S$2.8 billion (US$ billion). Sixteen more contracts related to electrical and mechanical work were awarded for a total of S$1 billion (US$ billion).

To construct the line, of private land was acquired and of government land was returned to the state. Several rental HDB blocks, private homes and shops were acquired, dismaying many affected residents. Those who had been asked to relocate in July 1996 requested more time to find new premises.

Construction of the line began with a groundbreaking ceremony at Farrer Park station on 25 November 1997. On 20 May 1999, SBS Transit (then Singapore Bus Service) was appointed to operate the line along with the Sengkang and Punggol LRT system. Parsons Brinckerhoff (through PB Merz and McLellan; now WSJ USA) was appointed to be the consultant for the line&#x27;s engineering and design.

Construction challenges on the line included diverting the Eu Tong Seng canal for construction of the Chinatown station, and avoiding flooding the tunnels and stations while boring tunnels under the Singapore River between the Clarke Quay and Dhoby Ghaut stations. At the Outram Park station, an arched roof of cement-filled steel pipes was laid underneath the EWL tunnels to minimise movement. Jet-grout arches were used to support the North-South line (NSL) tunnels when explosives were used to remove rock while tunnelling from Clarke Quay to Dhoby Ghaut. Roads around the line had to be temporarily diverted for construction.

When the 16 stations were announced, Potong Pasir (then named Sennett), Woodleigh and Punggol were planned to be built as shell stations due to lack of development around the station sites. It was later decided to build these stations in full as it would have been more costly to wait until later to complete the stations from the structural shells. In 1998, the timeline for Punggol station was moved up because of planned housing developments in the area. The decision not to build Sennett station generated political controversy, however, with claims by residents and opposition MP Chiam See Tong that the station would only open if the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) secured the constituency. In 2002, after a revised ridership study, the government decided to open the station with the other NEL stations due to projected developments around the site; the station also received its present name.

The NEL was initially expected to be completed by the end of 2002, with SBS staff trained in train maintenance and other technical aspects of the automated system. However, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in September 2002 that the line might be opened in April 2003 to allow sufficient time for testing. The line&#x27;s systems were handed over to SBS Transit on 16 December, and the operator conducted further tests. The NEL&#x27;s opening was delayed until June due to a glitch in the signalling system, however, with tests briefly handed over to the LTA. Since it had to bear the costs of maintenance and manpower, SBS Transit sought compensation from the government for the delay.

Except for two stations (Buangkok and Woodleigh), the NEL began operations on 20 June 2003 and was attended by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. About 140,000 people rode the line on its opening day. The line&#x27;s opening ceremony was held on 28 August by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Although the NEL has experienced a few glitches since its opening, it has been reliable and generally well-received by commuters. The International Association of Public Transport called the NEL a model public-transport system for the future in July 2003, with other driverless systems planned around the world. SBS Transit reported in June 2004 that the line averaged one 15-minute delay every six weeks, compared to expected twice-a-week delays. Average daily ridership has risen to 174,000 in 2004, with highest at 268,000 during Lunar New Year celebrations on 3 January that year.

===Opening of reserved stations===
On 17 June 2003, SBS Transit announced that the Woodleigh and Buangkok stations would not open with the other NEL stations. Due to the lack of development, the operator said keeping the stations closed would reduce operating costs by S$2–3 million. At the time, housing demand declined due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the economic downturn following the September 11 attacks. Consequently, the Housing and Development Board cut back on its development plans in the Singapore northeast area. Residents around the line were upset by the sudden decision to keep Buangkok station closed, since they had been assured by MPs and grassroots leaders that it would be opened.

The government initially stood by SBS Transit&#x27;s decision to keep the station closed, planning to open it in 2006 when more residential flats would be in the area. The opening was further postponed to 2008, following projected housing-development plans for the area. In August 2005, during a visit by youth minister Vivian Balakrishnan visit to Punggol South, eight white cardboard elephants were put up in protest, and a grass-roots leader was sternly warned after a police investigation into the incident. Following another evaluation by the LTA, SBS Transit announced at the end of 2005 that it would open the station on 15 January 2006.

The Buangkok station opened as scheduled &quot;with much fanfare&quot;. Since its opening, however, the station averaged only 1,386 daily riders instead of the expected 6,000. Many residents still traveled to the adjacent Sengkang and Hougang stations due to their amenities. SBS Transit, after saying that it was still &quot;too early to draw a conclusion&quot; about ridership, remained committed to keeping the station open to serve future developments nearby.

Woodleigh station, built near the former Bidadari cemetery, was scheduled to open seven or eight years after the rest of the line. In January 2011, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; reported that preparations for the station&#x27;s opening had been ongoing since the second half of 2010; the newspaper speculated that the station would open in mid-2011 to serve new developments in the area. In a March parliamentary session, Transport Minister Raymond Lim confirmed that the station would open on 20 June 2011. SBS deployed several staff members to assist confused commuters who alighted at Woodleigh station instead of the adjacent Serangoon station. Others alighted to view the station&#x27;s interior or try an alternative route from the station.

===North East Line extension (NELe)===
On 17 January 2013, transport minister Lui Tuck Yew announced a one-station extension of the NEL to serve upcoming developments in Punggol North. Although it was initially planned to extend the line by 2030, Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng announced on 7 June 2017 that the extension would be moved up to 2023 in conjunction with development plans for the area, later delayed to 2024 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The contract for the extension was awarded to China State Construction Engineering Corporation Limited (Singapore Branch) in December, and construction began that month. Although tunneling was completed on 13 November 2020, transport minister Ong Ye Kung said at the tunnel breakthrough ceremony that the Punggol Coast station&#x27;s completion would be delayed until 2024 due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In June and July 2024, NEL operations began later at 8am on Sundays to integrate testing and commissioning works with the new station. As previously announced by the LTA on 10 October 2024, Punggol Coast station opened on 10 December.

==Network and operations==
===Service===

In 2022, the NEL had a daily ridership of 527,000. The line operates between 5:30am and 12:30am. On weekdays and Saturdays, the first train leaves Punggol Coast (the northern terminus) at 5:39am; the last train leaves HarbourFront (the southern terminus) at 11:56pm. Trains run every 2.5 to 5 minutes, and the line&#x27;s total travel time is 35 minutes.

The NEL initially had a higher fare than the North–South and East–West lines due to greater operating costs. On 30 December 2016, however, fares were lowered to match the other lines with a &quot;purely distance-based approach&quot;. This revision, made after a fare review by the Public Transport Council, was intended to minimise commuter confusion.

The first line operated by SBS Transit, the NEL has been part of the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF) since 2018. Previously, the operator (the owner of the rail assets) had to bear the cost of maintaining and upgrading trains and signalling. Under the NRFF, the LTA and SBS Transit will share the profits and financial risks in operating the line and the LTA will take control of its operating assets on 1 April 2033. SBS Transit will operate the line under a 15-year licence which will expire on 31 March 2033.

===Route===
As its name implies, the fully-underground NEL runs from Singapore&#x27;s city centre to the northeastern parts of the island. The line goes northeast from HarbourFront station, paralleling New Bridge Road and Eu Tong Street in Chinatown between the Outram Park and Clarke Quay stations. Passing under the Singapore River and Fort Canning Hill to Dhoby Ghaut station, it continues north to Little India station under Bukit Timah Road. Following Race Course Road and Serangoon Road through Little India and Boon Keng, it crosses the Whampoa and Kallang Rivers before reaching Potong Pasir.

Between the Potong Pasir and Kovan stations, the NEL parallels Upper Serangoon Road before curving north to Hougang station. The line then runs along Hougang Avenue 6 and Sengkang Central to Sengkang station in Sengkang as well as Punggol station in Punggol. It then curves east towards Punggol Coast station. The line is coloured purple on official maps.

===Stations===
The line has 17 stations from HarbourFront to Punggol Coast. Eight stations (eventually nine upon completion of Cross Island line) connect to other MRT/LRT lines. A station designated &quot;NE2&quot;, which was included in the 1991 master plan between HarbourFront and Outram Park, may be built if development warrants it.

== Infrastructure ==
===Rolling stock===
The NEL&#x27;s rolling stock has six-car electric multiple unit (EMU) trains, with four doors per side on each carriage, and can accommodate up to 1,920 passengers per trainset. Twenty-five first-generation Alstom Metropolis C751A trains were ordered, built in France by Alstom in 2000 and 2001. An additional 18 second-generation Alstom Metropolis C751C trains, an updated version of the C751A, were delivered to Singapore beginning in July 2014 and were built in Shanghai between 2014 and 2016. To increase the line extension&#x27;s passenger capacity, an additional six third-generation Alstom Metropolis C851E trains were ordered. Built in Barcelona, the first trainset arrived in Singapore on 4 April 2021 and entered service on 28 July 2023.

The automatic trains are controlled by an operations control centre (OCC) at Sengkang Depot. The fleet&#x27;s brake systems permit smooth, quiet stopping. Train speeds can reach . Safety features include closed-circuit television cameras for train interiors and a passenger emergency communications system which allows communication between passengers and the OCC. The trains have wide seats and dedicated space for wheelchair users.

The trains are made of fire-resistant materials and include fire and smoke detectors and a fire barrier under its frame. They have a pair of beams (rail guards) which detect obstacles in the train&#x27;s path; smaller debris is swept away, and the train automatically stops if the beams detect larger objects. A 1,500V overhead catenary system (OCS) powers the trains, the MRT network&#x27;s first electrical system of that type. The OCS provides a safer environment for maintenance workers on the tracks and is less expensive, with a smaller conductor. In an emergency when the train is stopped, the doors on both sides can be opened easily without electricity and ramps lower for passenger evacuation in the tunnels.

In 2019, the first-generation trains began undergoing a mid-life refurbishment which is scheduled for completion by the third quarter of 2024. Upgrades include the replacement of interior parts and the installation of a new condition-monitoring system which will monitor train performance. The first refurbished train re-entered service on 28 February 2022.

With the passenger trains, the NEL tunnels and tracks are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. There are four types of engineering trains: the locomotive, for towing wagons with equipment; the heavy crane vehicle, for changing tracks; the multi-function vehicle, for detecting flaws on rails and in tunnels; and the rail-grinding machine, for grinding rails back into shape. The engineering trains are manufactured by Plasser &amp; Theurer, Speno, and Harsco Rail. A new fleet of engineering trains has been supplied by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive.

===Depot===

The Sengkang Depot, located along Sengkang East Avenue between the Buangkok and Sengkang stations, is the service and storage area for NEL trains. Built by Hyundai Engineering and Construction for S$350 million (US$ million), the depot includes the OCC which monitors the line&#x27;s train and station operations.

The depot can accommodate up to 44 trains, with three additional stabling tracks being built for the NELe as of 2019. It also houses LRT trains for the Sengkang and Punggol LRT lines above the depot.

Its facilities include a four-storey administrative building, maintenance bays, a workshop and an automated warehouse. The depot&#x27;s workshop has equipment which can raise an entire train for repairs, Singapore&#x27;s first such workshop. Using the NEL&#x27;s signalling system, train movement in the depot is mainly automatic. Staff members access the area via three dedicated tunnels for safety reasons.

The OCC also controls the equipment and systems of tunnels, stations, power substations and the depot, which are integrated into one terminal. The systems are managed by four or five rotating teams working around the clock. Alongside a training and software-development room, the OCC has a depot control centre to monitor and supervise its operations.

===Signalling===
The NEL is fully automatic, using Alstom&#x27;s Urbalis 300 moving-block signalling system. The NEL is the world&#x27;s first fully automated heavy-rail system. Its construction allowed the LTA to explore, integrate and implement new and existing technology as part of its vision of a fully-automated system. The line&#x27;s automatic train control (ATC) is based on Alstom&#x27;s MASTRIA software, which also manages its automatic train protection (ATP) and automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 4 (UTO). The Urbalis system also includes a computer-based Interlocking system which controls the track switches and interfaces with the ATC and the data-management system. The DMS, monitored by station staff, oversees the signalling equipment, platform doors and trains.

The ATP system maintains a buffer between trains. The minimum permitted distance is , although the average distance between trains is at least . Using microwave technology, the IAGO waveguide (Informatisation et Automatisation par Guide d&#x27;Onde or waveguide transmission line system for computer and automation applications) allows two-way communication between trains and monitors the trains&#x27; positions and movements. If a train enters the buffer, the ATP automatically adjusts the train&#x27;s speed.

At least 500 computer systems control the NEL. In case of a glitch, backup systems would take over; the system would &quot;go to sleep&quot; if it experiences a severe malfunction. In the event of system failure, drivers would be deployed to manually operate the trains. The NEL maintains its &quot;mean kilometres between failures&quot; target of one million train-km ( train-miles). As part of an NEL refurbishment programme announced on 17 December 2018, parts of the power and signalling systems were serviced and new rail crossings and tracks installed.

==Station facilities==
Every station has a passenger service centre (PSC) on its concourse. The PSCs are generally curved, unlike the boxier designs of those in older MRT stations. In addition to assisting passengers and checking and topping up their fare cards, the PSC staff monitors and controls the functions of connecting tunnels and communicates with the OCC at the depot. When a station is used as a civil-defence (CD) shelter, the PSC becomes the command centre.

Each NEL station is equipped with &quot;energy-smart&quot; Otis escalators connecting its levels. Their speed is reduced by half when not in use, reducing energy consumption and wear and tear. The Woodleigh station has one of the longest sets of escalators at . In addition to escalators, Dhoby Ghaut is the first MRT station with a set of travellators which link the NEL and NSL platforms.

All NEL stations have lifts which provide step-free access to their platforms. Most of the lifts have glass doors, which improve appearance and enhance security. Each lift has a communications system, connected to the station&#x27;s PSC. If a lift stalls during a station blackout, a battery-powered backup system provides lighting and ventilation for four hours.

===Accessibility===

In compliance with Singapore&#x27;s Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility, NEL stations have wheelchair-friendly facilities. Each station has an entrance that was built with barrier-free access via lifts and ramps, in contrast to older stations on previous lines which are being retrofitted.

The NEL has the MRT&#x27;s first tactile system. Consisting of tiles with raised rounded or elongated studs, the system intends to guide visually-impaired commuters through a station on a dedicated route from entrance to platforms. Station seats have armrests to assist those who have difficulty getting up.

These accessibility features were part of the recommendations of a LTA working group set up to improve accessibility on the MRT network. Associations representing the disabled were also consulted. The group completed its findings in 1999; only some of its recommendations had been adopted by 2003, since station infrastructure was nearly completed by then.

===Safety===

Westinghouse supplied 768 pairs of platform screen doors (PSDs) to the NEL&#x27;s original 16 stations. The PSDs are a safety barrier between passengers on platforms and trains. The PSDs enable climate control in a station, minimising the loss of cool air from the platforms and preventing warm air from entering the station from the tunnels. The Punggol Coast station&#x27;s PSDs are supplied by ST Engineering Electronics. The platforms have emergency-stop plungers (ESPs) to halt trains in an emergency.

More than 10,000 smoke and heat detectors are installed in the NEL&#x27;s stations as part of the line&#x27;s fire-alarm system. The alarm, which automatically alerts SBS Transit of any faults in the system, is integrated with the public address system; instead of alarm bells, pre-recorded messages would assist commuters in evacuating. In addition to the detectors, sprinkler and hose reel systems, dry riser pipeworks and an inert-gas system would contain a fire.

During a fire, escalators could be shut down remotely from the PSC and the fare gates opened for evacuation. The air-conditioning system would be shut down to minimise re-circulation of smoke. An installed &quot;smoke curtain&quot; system controls smoke movement, and automatic smoke-extraction fans remove any contained smoke.

===Civil defence===

All NEL stations except Dhoby Ghaut, Sengkang, Punggol and Punggol Coast are designated civil-defence (CD) shelters. Each CD station is designed to accommodate at least 7,500 people and withstand airstrikes and chemical attacks. Equipment essential for shelter operations is mounted on shock absorbers to prevent damage during a bombing. When electricity supply to the shelter is disrupted, backup generators are used.

During emergencies, large sliding doors would seal the entrances and the tunnel portals would be manually sealed by blast doors. The shelters have built-in decontamination chambers and dry toilets, with collection bins which would remove human waste from the shelter. The toilets are next to an exhaust ventilation outlet to remove odors.

==Culture==
===Architecture===

Each of the NEL stations has a unique design which reflects its location. The HarbourFront station has a maritime theme, with an elliptical ship&#x27;s-hull motif used for the ceiling and concourse entrances to the platforms. At Little India, the station walls&#x27; metal grills have leaf-shaped patterns similar to the door patterns of Hindu prayer rooms. The station&#x27;s design was intended to reflect Indian traditions.

Station entrances use glass, allowing natural lighting during the day. Exit A of the Chinatown station has a transparent pavilion-style roof, which allows natural light and provides an unobstructed view of the shophouses along Pagoda Street. At Serangoon, each of its four triangular-shaped entrances is painted a different colour and enclosed in a cubic structure. Unlike at the other NEL stations, the entrances to Buangkok do not use glass; white Teflon sheets are supported by metal frames.

Dhoby Ghaut station is the MRT network&#x27;s largest, and the five-level station is integrated with the twin-towered office complex Atrium@Orchard above it. The network&#x27;s first such integration of an MRT station with a commercial development, it permits more efficient land use and improves access to public transport. The station&#x27;s NEL platforms, underground, are some of the MRT&#x27;s deepest.

The four-level Sengkang station is an integrated hub, with Singapore&#x27;s three public-transport modes – MRT, LRT and bus – serving the Sengkang area. The MRT/LRT station was the MRT network&#x27;s first intermodal station for all three transport modes. In addition to its transport facilities, the station is integrated with the Compass Heights and Compass Point developments.

Designed by the 3HPArchitects and Farrells architectural firms, the Punggol station is integrated with the LRT station and the bus interchange. Its curved aluminium and stainless-steel cladding gives the station a futuristic look befitting the Punggol 21 developments. Covering along Punggol Central to accommodate bus stops, taxi stands and passenger drop-off points along the road, the station is the NEL&#x27;s longest.

===Artworks===
The line introduced the MRT network&#x27;s Art in Transit (AiT) programme, which showcases art in the network. Nineteen works by 20 artists are featured in its stations. Artists were selected by an art-review panel, which reviewed the artists&#x27; portfolios and managed conceptual development. Considered a &quot;significant milestone&quot; for public art in Singapore, AiT aims to enhance the riding experience. Unlike artwork in the original North–South and East–West Line stations, the works must be integrated into a station&#x27;s design and reflect the history and heritage of its surroundings.

<text>Nizami Ganjavi (; c. 1141 – 1209), Nizami Ganje&#x27;i, Nizami, or Nezāmi, whose formal name was Jamal ad-Dīn Abū Muḥammad Ilyās ibn-Yūsuf ibn-Zakkī, was a 12th-century Muslim poet. Nizami is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the Persian epic. His heritage is widely appreciated in Afghanistan, Republic of Azerbaijan, Iran, the Kurdistan region and Tajikistan.
==Life==

Born into a Persian family, his personal name was Ilyas and his chosen pen-name was Nizami (also spelled Nezami). He was born of an urban background in Ganja (Seljuq empire, now Republic of Azerbaijan) and is believed to have spent his whole life in the South Caucasus. According to De Blois, Ganja had a predominantly Iranian population at the time. The Armenian historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi (c. 1200 – 1271) mentions that &quot;This city [Ganja] was densely populated with Iranians and a small number of Christians&quot;. Because Nizami was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties. &quot;Tazkerehs&quot;, which are the compilations of literary memoirs that include maxims of the great poets along with biographical information and commentary of styles, refer to him briefly. Much of this material in these &quot;tazkerehs&quot; are based on legends, anecdotes, and hearsays. Consequently, few facts are known about Nizami&#x27;s life, the only source being his own work, which does not provide much information on his personal life.

===Parents===
Nizami was orphaned early and was raised by his maternal uncle Khwaja Umar, who took responsibility for him and afforded him an excellent education. His mother, named &quot;Ra&#x27;isa&quot;, was of Kurdish origin. His father, whose name was &quot;Yusuf&quot; is mentioned once by Nizami in his poetry. In the same verse, Nizami mentions his grandfather&#x27;s name as &quot;Zakki&quot;. In part of the same verse, some have taken the word &quot;Mu&#x27;ayyad&quot; as a title for Zakki while others have interpreted it as the name of his great-grandfather. Some sources have stated that his father might be possibly from Qom. Nizami is variously mentioned as a Persian and/or Iranian.

===Family===
Nizami was married three times. His first wife was an enslaved Kipchak who was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Darband, as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nizami&#x27;s &quot;most beloved&quot; wife. His only son &quot;Mohammad&quot; was from this wife. She died after &quot;Khosrow and Shirin&quot; was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nizami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and &quot;apple of my eyes&quot;. In &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.

Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called &quot;Afaq&quot;. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nizami&#x27;s first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nizami&#x27;s work and the assumption that &quot;Afaq&quot; was the real name of his wife and have taken the &quot;Afaq&quot; in that verse to simply mean &quot;horizon&quot; rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nizami&#x27;s two other wives, too, died prematurely – the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, &quot;God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!&quot;.

==Education==
Nizami was not a philosopher in the sense of Avicenna or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn &#x27;Arabi. However, he is regarded as a philosopher and gnostic who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as Qutb al-Din Shirazi.

Often referred to by the honorific Hakim (&quot;the Sage&quot;), Nizami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style. About Nizami&#x27;s prodigious learning, there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects, but Nizami seems to have been exceptionally so. His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with Arabic and Persian literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, botany, Koranic exegesis, Islamic theory and law, Iranian myths and legends, history, ethics, philosophy and esoteric thought, music, and the visual arts. His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement. Being a product of the Iranian culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran and the whole ancient world.

==Influences and literary scene==
The recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled &quot;Nozhat al-Majales&quot; contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (Arrān, Sharvān, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era. Unlike other parts of Persia, where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry. Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets. The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology. However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures. Khaqani&#x27;s mother was a Nestorian Christian, Mojir Baylqani&#x27;s mother was an Armenian, and Nizami&#x27;s mother was a Kurd. Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.

By the end of the 10th century, Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus. The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of Qatran Tabrizi (1009–1072) who served in the courts of the Shaddadid and Rawadid dynasties. Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; or &quot;Trans-Cacausian&quot; school or &quot;Tabriz School&quot; or &quot;Shirvan School&quot; or &quot;Arranian Style&quot; of Persian poetry. This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with &quot;Khurasani&quot; (&quot;Eastern&quot;) style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of technical terminology and Christian imagery, the presence of Persian archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts. Other sources including the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term &quot;&#x27;Iraqi&quot; style for the Persian poetry of Nizami.
The Seljuqs took control of Ganja from the Shaddadids in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts. In the middle of the 12th century, the Seljuk Empire&#x27;s control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian culture, art and poetry in their courts. Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era, when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants and merchants were in great demand and rival dynasties continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived. Nizami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties, including the Seljuqs, Eldiguzids (who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), Shirvanshahs, the ruler of Ahar and Ahmadilis. Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the courts and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life. Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties, which list the names of events of the ruling families.

According to literary scholar Chelkowski, &quot;it seems that Nizami&#x27;s favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi&#x27;s monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings).&quot; Nizami mentioned Ferdowsi as the Sage (&quot;hakim&quot;) and Knower/Wise (&quot;dānā&quot;) and the great master of discourse, &quot;who has decorated words like new bride.&quot; Nizami advises the son of the Shirvanshah to read the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise. Nizami used the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; as a source in his three epics of &quot;Haft Peykar, Khosrow and Shirin&quot; and &quot;Eskandar-Nameh&quot;.

The story of &quot;Vis and Ramin&quot; also had an immense influence on Nizami. Although Nizami takes the bases for most of his plots from Ferdowsi, but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani. This is especially noticeable in &quot;Khosrow and Shirin&quot;, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from &quot;Vis and Ramin&quot;. Nizami&#x27;s concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in &quot;Vis and Ramin&quot;. Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the Sufi influences, which are seen in Nizami&#x27;s epic poetry.

The first monumental work of Nizami, the &quot;Makhzan al-Asrar&quot; is influenced by Sanai&#x27;s &quot;Hadikat al-Hakika&quot;. Nizami acknowledges this, but considers his work to be superior. The main similarities between Sanai&#x27;s poem and Nizami&#x27;s are in its ethico-philosophical genre, although Nizami uses a different metre and organized the whole work in a different fashion. Khaqani Sherwani daring imagery, was to have a momentous influence on Nizami Ganjavi and through the latter on Persian poetry in general.

==Works==
Nizami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect, but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers. He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was the custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life. Nizami was a master of the &quot;masnavi&quot; style (double-rhymed verses).

===The &quot;Khamsa&quot; or &quot;Panj Ganj&quot;===
Nizami&#x27;s main poetical work, for which he is best known, is a set of five long narrative poems known as the &quot;Khamsa&quot; (, &#x27;Quintet or Quinary&#x27;) or &quot;Panj Ganj&quot; (, &#x27;Five Treasures&#x27;):
* &quot;Makhzan-ol-Asrâr&quot; (, &#x27;The Treasury or Storehouse of Mysteries&#x27;), 1163 (some date it 1176)
* &quot;Khosrow o Shirin&quot; (, &#x27;Khosrow and Shirin&#x27;), 1177–1180
* &quot;Leyli o Majnun&quot; (, &#x27;Layla and Majnun&#x27;), 1192
* &quot;Eskandar-Nâmeh&quot; (, &#x27;The Book of Alexander&#x27;), 1194 or 1196–1202
* &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; (, &#x27;The Seven Beauties&#x27;), 1197

The first of these poems, &quot;Makhzan-ol-Asrâr&quot;, was influenced by Sanai&#x27;s (d. 1131) monumental &quot;Garden of Truth&quot;. The four other poems are medieval romances. Khosrow and Shirin, Bahram-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, appear again here at the center of three of four of Nizami&#x27;s narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Layla and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources. In all these cases, Nizami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way.

The &quot;Khamsa&quot; was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and Mughal courts in later centuries. Examples include the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208), created for the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 1590s.

====&quot;Makhzan-ol-Asrâr&quot;====

The ethico-philosophical poems of about 2,250 Persian distichs were dedicated to Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Erzinjan. The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics. Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name. The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical Homiletics style. The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life. The general message of the discourse is that Nizami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God&#x27;s creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination. In a few chapters he address the duties of a king, but as a whole, he addresses himself to mankind in general rather than to his royal patrons. In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat. There is no indication that these were Sufi vigils, but they are used as a literary fantasy on the spiritually inclined poet he wanted to be. In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts. With this work, Nizami joins the destination of Persian poetry, which had started with Sanai and was continued by others, in the first place by Attar.

Not a romantic epic, &quot;The Treasury of Mysteries&quot; was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945. After this early work, Nizami turned towards narrative poetry.

====&quot;Khosrow o Shirin&quot;====

A story of pre-Islamic Persian origin which is found in the great historical epic poems of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets. The story chosen by Nizami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother Qizil Arslan. It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of Sasanian Khosrow II Parviz towards his Armenian princess Shirin. &quot;Khusrow and Shirin&quot; recounts the story of King Khosrow&#x27;s courtship of Princess Shirin, and the vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad. The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity. Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love. They are eventually married, but finally Khosrow is killed by his son and Shirin commits suicide over the body of her murdered husband. Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who falls victim to the king&#x27;s ire and jealousy.

The influence of &quot;Vis o Rāmin&quot; is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from &quot;Vis o Rāmin&quot;, as well as being in the same meter (&quot;hazaj&quot;) as Gorgāni&#x27;s poem. Nizami&#x27;s concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in &quot;Vis o Rāmin&quot;. In turn, Nizami&#x27;s great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made. With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature.

====&quot;Leyli o Majnun&quot;====
A story of Arabic origin which was later adapted and embellished by the Persians. The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sasanian King, whose exploits are reflected in Nizami&#x27;s &quot;Haft Paykar&quot; (&quot;Seven Beauties&quot;). The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla&#x27;s father. Layla&#x27;s father forbids contact with Qays, so that Qays becomes obsessed and starts singing of his love for Layla in public. The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet &quot;the possessed&quot; (Majnun). Realizing that he cannot obtain union, even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts. However, the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep. His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla. Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband. In a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact. Rather, they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla&#x27;s husband dies eventually, which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union. However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind, that he fled into the desert again. Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress. Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave, where he instantly dies. They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage. Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.

Nizami composed his romance at the request of the Shirvanshah Akhsatan. Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience. It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: &quot;wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them&quot;. Nizami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story, but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.

An important aspect of Layla and Majun is the poet&#x27;s highly humanitarian approach. During the war by Nawfal in favor of Majnun, the latter is unhappy, wishing the termination of the war. Majun gives away his horse and amours to save a gazelle and a stag.

Nizami gave a Persian character to the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc. Further, he adapted the different stories about Majnun to fit a well-crafted Persian romantic epic.

&quot;The Story of Layla and Majnun by Nizami&quot;, was edited and translated into English by Swiss scholar of Islamic culture Rudolf Gelpke and published in 1966. A comprehensive analysis in English containing partial translations of Nizami&#x27;s romance &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot; examining key themes such as chastity, constancy and suffering through an analysis of the main characters was published by Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab.

====&quot;Eskandar-Nâmeh&quot;====

The &quot;Iskandarnameh&quot; of Nizami contains 10,500 distichs. There are differences of opinion on whether this or the &quot;Haft Paykar&quot; was Nizami&#x27;s last epic. The names of its dedicatees are uncertain, but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned. The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from Qur&#x27;anic references to the Dhu&#x27;l-Qarnayn as well as from the Alexander romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander&#x27;s life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large. The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius. The episode also discusses Alexander&#x27;s pilgrimage to Mecca, his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda&#x27; and her court of Amazons. Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus. The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander&#x27;s unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.

The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander&#x27;s personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from Plato&#x27;s Republic. He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers ( &quot;Garshaspnama&quot;) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages. The poet then tells of Alexander&#x27;s end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages. Nizami&#x27;s image of Alexander is that of an Iranian knight.

An English translation of the &quot;Sharaf-Nama&quot; by Henry Wilberforce-Clarke was published in 1881 under the title &quot;Sikandar Nama e Bara&quot; and is available online.

====&quot;Haft Peykar&quot;====
A pre-Islamic story of Persian origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, Ala&#x27; al-Din Korp Arslan. It is a romanticized biography of Bahram V Gur, the Sassanid king, who is born to Yazdegerd after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to Ahura Mazda for a child. His adventurous life had already been treated by Ferdowsi in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, to which fact Nizami alludes a number of times. In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material. The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of Bahram Gur and his upbringing in the court of the Arab king No&#x27;man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq. Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to No&#x27;man becomes a formidable huntsman. While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses, hence the name &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; (seven beauties). Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (according to the traditional Zoroastrian-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them. His father Yazdegerd I passes away, and Bahram returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders. After some episodes, he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine. Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides. His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides. The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (according to the classical planetary system of the Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet. Bahram is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect. The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions. On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on. The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the Khaqan of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of Khwarazm; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka&#x27;us. Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color. These seven stories, characterized by François de Blois as &quot;beautifully constructed [and] highly sensuous,&quot; make up about half of the entire poem. While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm. Bahram Gur discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty, and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade. He clears his mind first by going hunting. After returning from the hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree. The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors. He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered. The minister is subsequently put to death and Bahram Gur restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to fire temples for the pleasure of God. Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears. As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (&quot;gūr&quot;) he instead finds his tomb (&quot;gūr&quot;).

Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition, describes it as: &quot;the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time [. . .] one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature&quot;. The Haft Peykar is considered the poet&#x27;s masterpiece. Overall, Nizami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.

The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson. A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Julie Scott Meysami in 1995.
The following lines present an excerpt (Original Persian):
===Other poetry===
Only a small corpus of his Persian lyric poetry, mainly &quot;qasidas&quot; (&quot;odes&quot;) and ghazals (&quot;lyrics&quot;) have survived. Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology &quot;Nozhat al-Majales&quot; (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani along with 23 other poets from Ganja. A famous ghazal of Nizami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal:

==Legacy==

Nizami, whose works are all written in Persian, has a very high reputation in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, where Persian is the official language. His poetry is especially well known in Iran, and is also very popular in Azerbaijan, where his birthplace and mausoleum are located. He is known in other countries, especially in India and Pakistan.

===Persian culture===
The influence of Nizami&#x27;s work on the subsequent development of Persian literature has been enormous and the Khamseh became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures). The legacy of Nizami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages.
In the history of Persian miniature painting, the stories in Nizami&#x27;s poems alongside those of Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnama&quot; have been the most frequently illustrated literary works. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Nizami is &quot;admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader.&quot; Nizami composed his verses in Persian language and Western encyclopedias such as &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and orientalists of many countries consider Nizami as a significant Persian poet and hail him as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature.
Amongst the many notable poets who have taken the &quot;Five Treasures&quot; of Nizami as their model may be mentioned Amir Khusro, Jalal Farahani, Khwaju Kermani, Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman Jami, Hatefi Jami, Vahshi Bafqi, Maktabi Shirazi, Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i, Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi, Fuzuli, Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali and Ahmad Khani. Not only poets, but also historians such as Rawandi were influenced by Nizami&#x27;s poetry and used his poems as a source for rendering history. Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the &quot;Makhzan al-Asrar&quot;.
According to Rudolf Gelpke, &quot;Many later poets have imitated Nizami&#x27;s work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persian and thirteen Turkish versions of &quot;Layli and Majnun&quot;.&quot;
According to Vahid Dastgerdi, &quot;If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot;.&quot;
Jami in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that: &quot;Although most of Nizami&#x27;s work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge.&quot;
Jami in his Baharestan mentions that &quot;Nizami&#x27;s excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description.&quot; Hashemi of Kerman remarks: The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nizami&#x27;s beautiful verses and to present words before Nizami&#x27;s silent speech is a waste of time.&quot;

=== Indian subcontinent ===

Nizami&#x27;s poems were very popular in the Indian subcontinent. The Persian language and literature have had a great impact on the entire Indian subcontinent. Nizami Ganjavi has been imitated by many poets due to his unique style of speech and language of poetry. Poets who have imitated Nizami&#x27;s include: Amir Khusro Delhi, Khwaju Kermani, Jami, Hatefi, Ghasemi, Vahshi Bafqi, &#x27;Orfi Shirazi, Maktabi, Faizi, Ashraf Maraghi, Azar Bigdeli, Badriddin Hilali, Rumi Kermani, Maulana Navidi Shirazi and Salman Savaji.
Amir Khusro Dehlavi praises Ganjavi in his poems as a master of the art of praise.
Amir Khusro writes:
&quot;The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,
Scholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.
In it – pure wine, it&#x27;s drunkenly sweet,
Yet in goblet [glass] beside us – only muddy setting.&quot;
A portrait of Nizami hangs in the Ashoka Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential palace of India. The hall is also decorated with poems by Nizami and other Persian poets. The &quot;Khamsa&quot; was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts with painted miniatures at the Persian and Mughal courts in later centuries. Examples include the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208), created for the Mughal emperor Akbar in the 1590s.

===Soviet Union===

In the early 1940s and to mark the 800th anniversary of Nizami Ganjavi, Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov planned to write seven songs based on Nizami&#x27;s poem about the &quot;Seven Beauties&quot;. However, Hajibeyov wrote only two songs: &quot;Sensiz&quot; (Without You, 1941) and &quot;Sevgili Janan&quot; (Beloved, 1943). Another Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev, composed Seven Beauties (ballet) in 1947–48 based on Nizami&#x27;s eponymous poem that won an international acclaim. He also composed Leyli and Majnun (ballet) that premiered on 25 May 1969 at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater in Baku and later was recorded as a film.
A minor planet, called 3770 Nizami, was discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh in 1974 and named after him. Further, the Museum of Azerbaijan literature in Baku is named after Nizami.

===Azerbaijan===

Nizami was depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 500 manat banknote of 1993–2006. In 2008, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of his death, the National Bank of Azerbaijan minted a 100 manat gold commemorative coin dedicated to his memory.
The Nizami Museum of Literature is located in Baku, Republic of Azerbaijan. One of the Baku Metro stations is also named after Nizami Ganjavi. There is Institute of Literature named after Nizami and Cinema named after Nizami in Baku. One of the districts of Baku is called Nizami raion. The life of Nizami Ganjavi is shown in the Azerbaijani movie &quot;Nizami&quot; (1982), in which the leading role, role of Nizami Ganjavi, was played by Muslim Magomayev. The Nizami Mausoleum, built in honor of Nizami, stands just outside the city of Ganja in Azerbaijan. It is a tall cylindrical building, surrounded by gardens. To one side, there is a metal statue commemorating Nizami&#x27;s epic poems. The mausoleum was originally built in 1947 in place of an old collapsed mausoleum and rebuilt in its present form when the Azerbaijani Republic regained its independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Monuments to Nizami exist in many cities of Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran, as well as in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Udmurtiya (Russia), Kyiv (Ukraine), Beijing (China), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Marneuli (Georgia), Chişinău (Moldova), Rome (Italy).

2021 was declared as &quot;Year of Nizami Ganjavi&quot; in the country.

===Western reception===
German poet and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: &quot;A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when Ferdowsi had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love. &quot;Majnun and Layli&quot;, &quot;Khosrow and Shirin&quot;, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.&quot;

In regard to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: &quot;The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has always been vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is reverential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the &quot;Musha&#x27;areh&quot;, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami&#x27;s work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituality and genuine piety. For richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled&quot;.

Nizami&#x27;s story &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot; also provided the namesake for a hit single by Eric Clapton, also called &quot;Layla&quot;. Recorded with the group Derek and the Dominos, the song was released on the 1970 album &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;. The album was influenced by Nizami and his poetry of unrequited love. The fifth song of the album, &quot;I Am Yours&quot;, was based on a poem by Nizami, set to music by Clapton.

In 2004, a conference on Nizami was held at the University of Cambridge. The proceedings of this conference were published under the title &quot;Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim&quot; in 2011.

<doc id="433761" wikidata="Q569278" url="?curid=433761" title="1992 Buenos Aires Israeli embassy bombing">
<text>The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was a suicide bombing attack on the building of the Israeli embassy of Argentina, located in Buenos Aires, which was carried out on 17 March 1992. 29 civilians were killed in the attack and 242 additional civilians were injured.

==The attack==

On 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC−3), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy located on the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed. Four Israelis died, but most of the victims were Argentine civilians, many of them children. The blast killed 29 and wounded 242. It was Argentina&#x27;s deadliest terror attack until the 1994 AMIA bombing and it remains the deadliest attack on an Israeli diplomatic mission.

===Fatalities===
Priest Juan Carlos Brumana was one of the people killed in the suicide bombing. He died in the Catholic Church Mater Admirabilis that is in front of the embassy. Among the dead there were two Israeli women who were the wives of the embassy&#x27;s consul and first secretary.

==Responsibility==
A group called Islamic Jihad Organization, which has been linked to Iran and possibly Hezbollah, claimed responsibility; their stated motive for the attack was Israel&#x27;s assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayed Abbas al-Musawi in February 1992. Islamic Jihad also released surveillance footage they took of the embassy before the blast.

After the bombing, Israel sent investigators to Argentina to search for clues. They learned that the bombers planned the attack in the Tri-Border area, where the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet and which has a large Muslim population. Messages intercepted by the American National Security Agency revealed Iranian knowledge of the impending attack, as well as the complicity of Hezbollah operative Imad Mughniyah. In fact, Mughniyah was formally charged by Argentina with participating in the bombings of the Israeli embassy.

In May 1998, Moshen Rabbani (the Cultural Attaché in the Iranian Embassy in Argentina until December 1997) was detained in Germany, and the Argentine government expelled seven Iranian diplomats from the country, stating that it had &quot;convincing proof&quot; of Iranian involvement in the bombing. However, none of the suspects were prosecuted. The attack occurred when Iran and Argentina were hoping for a resumption of nuclear cooperation, although Argentina had announced the suspension of the shipments of nuclear materials to Iran a couple months before the bombing. A number of sources report on Hezbollah involvement with the assistance of Syria. Hezbollah denies these claims.

In 1999, the Argentine government issued an arrest warrant for Imad Mughniyah in connection with this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. It is suspected that the two attacks are linked.

In 2023, the United States sanctioned Hezbollah operative Amer Mohamed Akil Rada, who was active in Latin America for over a decade, for his reported role in this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing.

In April 2024, Argentina&#x27;s second highest court ruled that the Iranian government was responsible for the bombing, and that it was carried out in retaliation for Argentina reneging on agreements to transfer nuclear material to Iran. The ruling also characterized Iran as a terrorist state.

==Aftermath==
===Kirchner on the case===
When he was president, Néstor Kirchner pronounced that allowing these two incidents to happen, with no real inquiries to be followed, equalled a &quot;national disgrace&quot;. He reopened, and kept open files from these incidents, most to be read by Justice Juan Jose Galeano. In the same process Kirchner hoped to lift the ban for former Intelligence Officers (Argentine) to testify. A former president of Argentina (his widow, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) also claimed that she wanted to get to the bottom of the case. Argentinian federal prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was assigned to investigate the bombing, but one day before he was scheduled to report on his findings, he was found dead in his home on 18 January 2015.

===Commemoration===
Today there is a memorial set up in place of where the building stood. In the memorial plaza stand twenty one trees and seven benches in memory of the victims. A plaque describing the event and listing the victims is located in the memorial in both Hebrew and Spanish.

<doc id="433762" wikidata="Q2012929" url="?curid=433762" title="Raymond Thayer Birge">
<text>Raymond Thayer Birge (March 13, 1887 – March 22, 1980) was an American physicist.

== Career ==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, into a family of academic scientists, Birge obtained his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1913. In the same year he married Irene A. Walsh. The Birges had two children, Carolyn Elizabeth (Mrs. E. D. Yocky) and Robert Walsh, Associate Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1973-1981. After five years as an instructor at Syracuse University, he became a member of the physics department at University of California, Berkeley, where he remained until he retired, as chairman, in 1955.

On his arrival at Berkeley, Birge sought collaboration with the Berkeley College of Chemistry, then under the leadership of Gilbert N. Lewis. However, Birge&#x27;s championing of the Bohr atom led him into conflict with the chemists who defended Lewis&#x27; earlier theory of the cubical atom. Birge was unafraid of scientific controversy and persevered with his course on atomic structure, attracting future Nobel Laureates in chemistry William Francis Giauque and Harold Clayton Urey. His work on molecular spectra included the development of the Birge-Sponer method, which was later generalized by the LeRoy-Bernstein theory.

Birge&#x27;s later work arose from his initial bewilderment at the variety and inconsistency among measurements of the fundamental physical constants. His interest led to a broad mastery of all branches of the physical sciences and gave fruit with many publications, in particular, a 1929 paper in &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot; that recommended a standard set of values for the constants based on earlier published results. There ensued a frustration with the conventional methods of statistics as applied in physical science which led to a collaboration with W. Edwards Deming. Following their 1934 joint paper in &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot;, their approaches diverged with Deming following the work of Walter A. Shewhart while Birge became interested in the more conventional statistical approaches of least squares and maximum likelihood. Birge&#x27;s interest in statistics led him to the investigation of parapsychology in which he conducted many experiments without finding any conclusive results.

== Leadership of Berkeley Physics Department ==

Birge was an active administrator and was the architect of the department&#x27;s prestige, seeking out physicists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest Lawrence and guiding the department through its golden years of the 1930s and through the changes brought on by World War II, the Manhattan Project, and the birth of &quot;Big Science.&quot;

In the late 1930s, Birge opposed the creation of an assistant professorship for Oppenheimer&#x27;s associate Robert Serber, writing another colleague that &quot;one Jew in the department is enough.&quot; Both Oppenheimer and Serber were Jewish.
During the McCarthy era in 1949, the Regents of the University of California enforced an anti-communist oath to be signed by all employees. Though an outspoken critic of the oath, after much searching of conscience, Birge decided that his loyalty to the department and the university demanded that he sign and fight from within for freedom of speech. Many of his colleagues did not sign and were dismissed.

== Death and honors ==

Birge died in Berkeley, California. His honors include:

* President of the American Physical Society;
* Member of the National Academy of Sciences; 
* Member of the American Philosophical Society; and
* Honorary degree of LLD from the University of California, Berkeley.

In December 1964, the new physics building on Berkeley campus, Birge Hall, was dedicated to Raymond Birge.

==May 19, 2000==
*A group led by George Speight takes Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and others hostage in the Parliament building of Fiji in Suva.
*Speight names Timoci Silatolu interim Prime Minister.
*The President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, denounces the coup, and declares a state of emergency.

==May 20, 2000==
*The military and police pledge loyalty to Mara.

==May 26, 2000==
*Fifteen soldiers and two officers defect to the coup.

==May 27, 2000==
*The rebels try to break the siege. Gunfire is exchanged.
*President Mara dismisses Mahendra Chaudhry and appoints Ratu Tevita Momoedonu as Prime Minister in his place. Momoedonu holds office for only a few minutes: he is appointed in order to &quot;advise&quot; the President to assume emergency powers, something that Chaudhry, in captivity, is unable to do. Mara claims to be following the Great Council of Chiefs. Mara offers Speight a pardon, which Speight rejects. (Mara later accused the Great Council of Chiefs of deception: according to him, they had lost confidence in him also, although that did not become apparent until two days later).

==May 29, 2000==
*Commodore Frank Bainimarama declares himself head of an Interim Military Government, with the claimed backing of the previous president, and declares martial law. (In an interview on 29 April of the following year, deposed President Mara denied that he had given Bainimarama his support. His resignation had been, he said, extorted from him, following his refusal of their request to abrogate the constitution).

==May 30, 2000==
*Bainimarama revokes the 1997 constitution and names Ratu Epeli Nailatikau interim Prime Minister. After opposition from Speight, he withdraws the nomination on 31 May.

==June 7, 2000==
*Fiji is suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations.

==June 20, 2000==
*Speight rejects an ultimatum demanding he sign an accord.

==July 4, 2000==
*Laisenia Qarase made interim Prime Minister.

==July 6, 2000==
*Rebels cut off Suva&#x27;s power supply.

==July 7, 2000==
*Rebels overrun the Sukunaivalu Barracks in Labasa, on the northern island of Vanua Levu (see Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état)
*Gunfire between rebels and military in Suva

==July 9, 2000==
*Speight and the military sign an accord.
*There is rioting in Levuka

==July 12, 2000==
*Speight&#x27;s group release 9 hostages.

==July 13, 2000==
*Chaudhry and the other hostages are released. Ratu Josefa Iloilo named as interim President. Ratu Jope Seniloli is Vice-President.

==July 27, 2000==
*Speight is arrested in contravention of an earlier accord granting him immunity from prosecution, an accord agreed to by the military, according to Bainimarama, only &quot;under duress.&quot;

==November 2, 2000==
*A failed mutiny at Suva&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Barracks leaves four loyal soldiers dead. Four rebels are subsequently beaten to death.

==November 15, 2000==
*The High Court declares the interim government to be illegal, orders the reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution, of Mara as President and of the Chaudhry government. Mara resigns, backdating his resignation to 29 May. The government appeals the ruling.

==March 1, 2001==
*The Court of Appeal upholds the High Court ruling reinstating the constitution.

<text>Joseph-Marie Vien (sometimes anglicised as Joseph-Mary Wien; 18 June 1716 – 27 March 1809) was a French painter. He was the last holder of the post of Premier peintre du Roi, serving from 1789 to 1791.

==Biography==
He was born in Montpellier. Protected by Comte de Caylus, he entered at an early age the studio of Natoire, and obtained the &quot;grand prix&quot; in 1745. He used his time at Rome in applying to the study of nature and the development of his own powers all that he gleaned from the masterpieces around him; but his tendencies were so foreign to the reigning taste that on his return to Paris he owed his admission to the academy for his picture &quot;Daedalus and Icarus&quot; (Louvre) solely to the indignant protests of François Boucher.

When in 1776, at the height of his established reputation, he became director of the school of France at Rome, he refused to take Jacques-Louis David with him amongst his pupils, stating he was too old to teach a young artist. After his return, five years later, his fortunes were wrecked by the French Revolution; but he undauntedly set to work, and at the age of eighty (1796) carried off the prize in an open government competition. Napoleon Bonaparte acknowledged his merit by making him a senator.

Joseph-Marie Vien died in Paris, and was buried in the crypt of the Panthéon. He left behind him many other brilliant pupils, amongst whom were François-André Vincent, Jean-Antoine-Théodore Giroust, Jean-Baptiste Regnault, Joseph-Benoît Suvée, Jean-Pierre Saint-Ours, François-Guillaume Ménageot, Jean-Joseph Taillasson and others of high merit; nor should the name of his wife, Marie-Thérèse Reboul (1728–1805), herself a member of the academy, be omitted from this list. Their son, Marie Joseph, born in 1761, also distinguished himself as a painter.

<doc id="433769" wikidata="Q790640" url="?curid=433769" title="Aversion therapy">
<text>Aversion therapy is a form of psychological treatment in which the patient is exposed to a stimulus while simultaneously being subjected to some form of discomfort. This conditioning is intended to cause the patient to associate the stimulus with unpleasant sensations with the intention of quelling the targeted (sometimes compulsive) behavior.

Aversion therapies can take many forms, for example: placing unpleasant-tasting substances on the fingernails to discourage nail-chewing; pairing the use of an emetic with the experience of alcohol; or pairing behavior with electric shocks of mild to higher intensities.

Aversion therapy, when used in a nonconsensual manner, is widely considered to be inhumane. At the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, aversion therapy is used to perform behavior modification in students as part of the center&#x27;s applied behavioral analysis program. The center has been condemned by the United Nations for torture.

==In addictions==
Various forms of aversion therapy have been used in the treatment of addiction to alcohol and other drugs since 1932 (discussed in &quot;Principles of Addiction Medicine&quot;, Chapter 8, published by the American Society of Addiction Medicine in 2003).

An approach to the treatment of alcohol dependence that has been wrongly characterized as aversion therapy involves the use of disulfiram, a drug which is sometimes used as a second-line treatment under appropriate medical supervision. When a person drinks even a small amount of alcohol, disulfiram causes sensitivity involving highly unpleasant reactions, which can be clinically severe. Rather than as an actual aversion therapy, the nastiness of the disulfiram-alcohol reaction is deployed as a drinking deterrent for people receiving other forms of therapy who actively wish to be kept in a state of enforced sobriety (disulfiram is not administered to active drinkers).

Another approach in creating aversions to alcohol consumption is the implementation of succinylcholine chloride-induced paralysis and respiratory arrest following exposure to alcohol. However, this method has not been found to be effective in emetic therapy or covert sensitation. Additionally, many patients reported a sense of fear and anxiety pertaining to dying as a result of the treatment, therefore this tactic is not recommended for therapeutic use.

===Cocaine dependency===
Emetic (to induce vomiting) therapy and faradic (administered shock) aversion therapy have been used to induce aversion for cocaine dependency. When used in a multimodal program, chemical aversion therapy displayed high patient acceptability among cocaine users as well as promising outcomes such as aversions to the sight, taste, and smell of the drug.

===Cigarette addiction===
It is unknown whether aversion therapy, in the form of rapid smoking (to provide an unpleasant stimulus), can help tobacco smokers overcome the urge to smoke. Although in recent years, a new tactic in aversion therapy has been introduced specifically to individuals who struggle with nicotine addiction. A device, which is worn on the wrist of the user, holds a self administered electrical stimulus within it aimed at deterring the use of nicotine.

==In compulsive habits==
Aversion therapy has been used in the context of subconscious or compulsive habits, such as chronic nailbiting, hair-pulling (trichotillomania), or skin-picking (commonly associated with forms of obsessive compulsive disorder as well as trichotillomania).

In treating sexually deviant behavior, aversion therapy is implemented in the form of shame. The goal in this kind of therapy is to target the individuals who feel disgusted by their compulsive behaviors. The disgust aspect is what would implement shame, thus hopefully limiting their need and want to act on their compulsive behaviors. This is done by ensuring that the individual is aware they are being observed and judged during the act.

== In history ==
Pliny the Elder attempted to heal alcoholism in the first century Rome by putting putrid spiders in alcohol abusers&#x27; drinking glasses.

In 1935, Charles Shadel turned a colonial mansion in Seattle into the Shadel Sanatorium where he began treating alcoholics for their substance use disorder. His enterprise was launched with the help of gastroenterologist Walter Voegtlin and psychiatrist Fred Lemere. Together, they created a medical practice that exclusively treated chronic alcoholism through Pavlovian conditioned reflex aversion therapy.

In the 1960s and 1970s aversion therapy was used on a small group of lesbian and bisexual identifying women in England. Electric shocks and injections to induce vomiting were used to prevent the woman from looking at other women. This was meant to work as a form of conversion therapy.

==In popular culture==
* In Anthony Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962) and the film adaptation (1971) directed by Stanley Kubrick, the main character Alex is subjected to a fictional form of aversion therapy, called the &quot;Ludovico technique&quot;, with the aim of stopping his violent behavior.
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; (1990), Dr. Monroe administers aversion therapy to the family to deter bad behavior.
* In the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot; (1997), one of the characters is forced to smoke an entire carton of cigarettes to discourage them from smoking, only for this tactic to backfire and worsen addiction.

== Judge Rotenberg Center ==
The Judge Rotenberg Center is a school in Canton, Massachusetts that uses the methods of ABA to perform behavior modification in children with developmental disabilities. Before it was banned in 2020, the center used a device called a Graduated Electronic Decelerator (GED) to deliver electric skin shocks as aversives. The Judge Rotenberg Center has been condemned by the United Nations for torture as a result of this practice. While many human rights and disability rights advocates have campaigned to shut down the center, as of 2020 it remains open. Six students have died of preventable incidents at the school since it opened in 1971.

== Criticism ==
Aversion therapy has been scrutinized in recent decades due to the controversy surrounding the techniques implemented in this kind of psychological treatment. These techniques such as electrical shocks and taste aversion, directly aim at creating an unpleasant stimuli to deter unwanted compulsive behavior. Some mental health professionals deem this tactic to be unethical since it is implementing punishment as a therapeutic tool. Aversion therapy has the risk of creating other psychological issues such as anxiety, depression, pain, fear and in severe cases even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

<text>ORP &quot;Orzeł&quot; was an &quot;Orzeł&quot; class submarine of the Polish Navy that served during World War II.
==Construction==

&quot;Orzeł&quot; was laid down 14 August 1936 at the Dutch shipyard De Schelde, as Job No. 205; launched on 15 January 1938, and commissioned on 2 February 1939. She was a modern design (designed by the joint venture of Polish and Dutch engineers), albeit quite large for the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea.

==World War II==

===Polish Campaign===

At the beginning of the invasion of Poland &quot;Orzeł&quot; was docked in Oksywie. As per the Worek Plan, the submarine was deployed on patrol in a designated strategic zone of the Baltic Sea. The crew received orders to attack the pre-dreadnought &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;, should it leave Danzig. With the situation rapidly deteriorating, &quot;Orzel&quot; abandoned its sector on 4 September and began to withdraw into the Baltic Sea. The submarine was attacked by the German minesweepers &quot;M3&quot; and &quot;M4&quot; and was damaged but evaded destruction that evening.

===Escape to Britain===

&quot;Orzel&quot;″s crew decided to head to Tallinn, Estonia as a result of the damage. &quot;Orzeł&quot; reached Tallinn on 14 September 1939. On 15 September the captain, Lieutenant-Commander , was forced to leave the submarine to undergo hospital treatment for an unknown illness he had been suffering from since 8 September. Under the Hague Convention of 1907, section XIII, Article 12, &quot;belligerent ships&quot; could enter a neutral port but were forbidden from remaining there for &quot;more than twenty-four hours.&quot; At the insistence of Germany, the Estonian military authorities boarded the ship, interned the crew, confiscated all the navigation aids and maps, and commenced removing all her armaments. However, only fifteen of her twenty torpedoes were removed before the hoist cable parted; this was because it had been secretly sabotaged by her new commander, former chief officer, Lieutenant Jan Grudzinski.

The crew of &quot;Orzeł&quot; conspired to carry out a daring escape. Around midnight on 18 September, the submarine&#x27;s Estonian guards were overpowered, the mooring lines were cut, and &quot;Orzeł&quot; got under way. The alarm was raised, and her conning tower was peppered by machine-gun fire. Running half-submerged, &quot;Orzeł&quot; ran aground on a bar at the harbour mouth, where artillery fire damaged her wireless equipment. Grudzinski managed to get the boat off the bar by blowing her tanks, and she proceeded out of the Gulf of Finland, intending to sail for a British port, the crew having heard a radio report that the Polish submarine had been welcomed in Britain.

&quot;Orzel&quot; escaped from Tallinn with two Estonian guards on board as hostages. The Estonian and German press covering the &quot;Orzeł&quot; incident declared the two captured guards missing at sea. Grudzinski set them ashore in Sweden, providing them with clothing, money, and food for their safe return to homeland. The Polish crew believed that &quot;those returning from the underworld deserve to travel first class only&quot;. The escape of the submarine &quot;Orzeł&quot; was used by the Soviet Union and Germany to challenge Estonian neutrality.
Since &quot;Orzeł&quot;″s navigational charts had all been removed by the Estonian authorities, Captain Grudzinski resolved to stop a German ship and take her charts. However, the only German vessels encountered were warships rather than merchantmen. The submarine&#x27;s sole remaining navigational aid was a list of lighthouses, and using these as a reference, &quot;Orzeł&quot; followed a course along the Baltic coast, around Denmark, and out into the North Sea, where she came under attack by British as well as German forces, since without her wireless equipment she had no means of identifying herself.

Forty days after she had originally sailed from Gdynia, &quot;Orzeł&quot; made landfall, off the east coast of Scotland. She lay on the bottom until emergency repairs were made to the radio, then surfaced to transmit a message in English. A Royal Navy destroyer then came out and escorted her into port, to the surprise of the British who had thought her sunk already weeks earlier.

&quot;Orzeł&quot; sank no enemy vessels during her journey from Estonia to Britain, but Soviet authorities blamed her for sinking the Soviet tanker &quot;Metallist&quot; in Narva Bay on 26 September, and used the incident as a pretext for the Soviet invasion of Estonia.

===Norwegian Campaign===

After a refit, &quot;Orzeł&quot; was assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s 2nd Submarine Flotilla and was assigned to patrol missions. Shortly after noon on 8 April 1940 she sank the clandestine German troopship off the small harbour village of Lillesand in southern Norway, killing hundreds of German troops intended for the invasion of Norway. &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot; was heading to Bergen in order to take part in the initial landings of Operation Weserübung – the invasion of Norway and opening move of the Norwegian Campaign. News that several hundred German soldiers were rescued by the Norwegian Navy and some had admitted their intention to occupy Norway reached the Norwegian parliament that evening, but the news was dismissed and no steps were taken to alert their Navy or Coast Guard of the impending invasion. Two days later &quot;Orzeł&quot; fired a torpedo at a German minesweeper V 705; however, she was forced to dive before the sinking of the German ship could be confirmed. The ship was not damaged by the torpedoes.

==Loss==

On 23 May 1940, &quot;Orzeł&quot; departed on its seventh patrol in the central North Sea. On 1 and 2 June, radio messages were transmitted from the Rosyth Naval base ordering the boat to alter its patrol area and proceed to the Skagerrak (the strait separating Norway and Sweden from the Danish Jutland peninsula). No radio signals had been received from her since she had sailed, and on 5 June &quot;Orzeł&quot; was ordered to return to base. No reception was acknowledged. On 8 June 1940 the submarine was officially declared lost. The true cause is unknown, although it is commonly believed &quot;Orzeł&quot; most likely struck a British or German sea mine in or near the Skagerrak. Another theory suggests the boat may have been sunk mistakenly by a British aircraft.

==Search for the wreck==
Between 2008 and 2017 a number of Polish expeditions, both private and public-funded, searched the region of North Sea where she went missing with the hope of finding her final resting place. Wrecks of various other ships have been located, but &quot;Orzeł&quot; has not been among them, and the fate of the ship remains unknown.

In June 2013 the Polish Navy, following reports of a wreck of an unknown large submarine found in the North Sea, conducted one more expedition to check whether the ship could be &quot;Orzeł&quot;. The wreck was surveyed and identified as . In 2017 another private expedition found a previously unknown wreck which they identified to be most likely based on sonar data.

On May 23, 2020, 80 years after &quot;Orzeł&quot; left on its final patrol, the Shipwreck Expeditions Association announced a partnership to search for the wreck in conjunction with the Maritime University of Szczecin with the assistance from the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland and the Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation. 
The search is currently entering the logistics and preparations phase for the first expedition.

<doc id="433774" wikidata="Q4768656" url="?curid=433774" title="Anne Moffat">
<text>Anne Moffat (born 30 March 1958) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Lothian from 2001 to 2010. She was deselected by her Constituency Labour Party and replaced by Fiona O&#x27;Donnell.

==Early life==
Born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1958, she is of the Moffat family of East Lothian and Fife, but was known by her married name, Anne Picking. She contested the 2005 election under her married name, despite having been divorced for two years, so as not to confuse the voters. Following the election she returned to her maiden name. She attended Woodmill High School in Dunfermline before embarking on a career in nursing.

She joined the Fife Health Board in 1975 as a nursing assistant, becoming a pupil nurse in 1977, before becoming a State Enrolled Nurse in 1978 working at the Lynebank Hospital in Dunfermline. In 1978 she left Fife and joined the Northern Ireland Eastern Health Service in 1980, leaving in 1983 as a staff nurse. 

She moved to England in 1983 and joined the East Kent Community Health Care Trust as a staff nurse. She became a councillor in 1994 on the Ashford Borough Council where she served until 2000. She has been a member of the National Executive Committee since 1990. Moffat is also a member of UNISON and the Trades Union Congress&#x27;s General Purposes Committee. 

==Parliamentary career==
Moffat was elected to the House of Commons for the East Lothian constituency in the 2001 general election.

She served on a number of select committees including the Modernisation and Accommodation and Works Committee (2004–2005), the European Scrutiny Committee (2004–2005) and Trade and Industry Select Committee (2005–2007). She was also Parliamentary Private Secretary to Alan Johnson at the Department of Health from 2008 to 2009.

In November 2008, Moffat was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Summer Olympics, saying that football &quot;should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage&quot;. The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.

===Travel expenses===
In 2003–2004, Moffat billed the taxpayer £39,744 for travel expenses – the highest of any Member of Parliament.

Green Party activist Michael Collie fought to have the details of the claims published under the Freedom of Information Act. The UK Parliament refused to disclose the information for a total of two years, going as far as the High Court to prevent its disclosure. It was not until November 2007 that Moffat&#x27;s expenses were finally made public.

Moffat claimed for first-class rail and air fares and trips to Malta and Portugal. Moffat claimed £9,792 in rail fares, with the average claim for a London to Glasgow/Edinburgh journey being £277. She had also claimed £1,817 in rail fares for 42 trips between Heathrow and Central London – an average of £43 when the highest priced ticket costs £18. Moffat claimed £15,712 for air travel between London and Scotland, plus £12,289 in mileage (a total of 24,129 miles). In total for the period 2002–2005 Moffat&#x27;s travel expenses amounted to £95,539. She cut her claims by 70% in 2006–07, claiming £12,331. In 2007/2008 she had the joint highest expenses claims for Additional Costs Allowances including claims for £400 per month for food even when Parliament is not sitting.

===Hitler comparison of First Minister===
On 23 May 2007, she compared the newly elected Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond to Adolf Hitler, saying that &quot;proportional representation gave Germany Adolf Hitler and in Scotland to a lesser degree we&#x27;ve had the member for Banff and Buchan&quot; during a debate in the House of Commons on the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. Angus Robertson criticised Moffat&#x27;s conduct, saying: &quot;It was ignorant, it was ill-judged, it was plain wrong, and it was very dangerous.&quot; Moffat said, &quot;What I was referring to was the voting system, the proportional representation and electoral voting system, not about individuals. I was just giving examples.&quot;

===Deselection by constituency party===
In November 2008 the East Lothian constituency party passed a vote of no confidence in Moffat. Her critics claimed dissatisfaction over Moffat&#x27;s travel expenses and disputes with constituency staff. In response, the national Labour Party suspended the constituency party.

However, the East Lothian Labour Party proceeded to vote on 22 January 2010 to deselect Anne Moffat. This was confirmed by a further vote by 130 to 59 on 19 March 2010.

Her critics, who included senior party officials in the constituency, asserted that she had neglected her duties as an MP, as exemplified by having been, at one point, the MP to make the lowest number of speeches in the House of Commons; that she had failed to attend party meetings; and that she had failed to properly represent her constituents.

On 23 March the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party rejected her appeal. On 25 March it emerged that she had negotiated a retirement deal as an MP on the grounds of poor health.

==Personal life==
Moffat is married to her second husband Lawrence McCran. She has one son.

In May 2008, Moffat was attacked and robbed near her home by a gang of youths. She was knocked unconscious and had her watch and jewellery stolen.

On 25 May 2009, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Moffat had visited hospital with what was described as &quot;traces of blood on the pituitary gland&quot;.

<text>Richard Lewis Page (born 22 February 1941) is a former Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom from 1976 to 1979, and from 1979 to 2005.

==Early life==
Born the son of Victor Charles Page, he went to the independent Hurstpierpoint College in West Sussex and Luton Technical College, gaining a HNC in Mechanical Engineering in 1962. He was an apprentice at Vauxhall Motors in Luton from 1959 to 1963, and then worked for Page Holdings, becoming the Chairman from 1985 to 1995 and 1997 onwards.

He was member of the Young Conservatives from 1964 to 1966 and a district councillor in Banstead, Surrey, from 1968 to 1971.

==Parliamentary career==
Page contested Workington in the February and October 1974 elections. He won the seat in the by-election caused by the elevation of Labour&#x27;s Fred Peart to the House of Lords in 1976, becoming the first Conservative to represent the constituency since it was created in 1918, before losing the seat in May 1979. Page re-entered Parliament shortly afterwards, when he won the safe Conservative seat of South West Hertfordshire in a by-election in December that year. He is therefore distinguished as one of a handful of MPs who have been successful in two by-elections.

Page twice served as Private Parliamentary Secretary to John Biffen–firstly whilst Biffen was Secretary of State for Trade from 1981 to 1982; and later during his stint as Leader of the House from 1983 to 1987. Page was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry under John Major, with responsibility for small business, Sustainable energy, biotechnology, coal, oil; as well as British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, the UK&#x27;s nationalised nuclear power corporation. He was the opposition front-bench spokesman on Trade and Industry from 2000 to 2001.

He was the lead minister in the privatisation of AEA Technology, and used his knowledge of the private members&#x27; ballot procedure to be successful with two private members&#x27; bills from the single private members&#x27; ballot slot. Page moved a 10-minute rule bill to reduce the number of MPs, claiming it could allow MPs to be better paid and save the state money.

Page was a Member of the Public Accounts Committee in the years 1987-95 and 1997–2000. He was also the Vice-Chairman of: the Conservative Trade and Industry Committee from 1988 to 1995; the All Party Engineering Group from 1997 to 2005; and the All Party Chemistry Group from 1997 to 2005. He was the Joint Chairman of the All-Party Racing and Bloodstock Committee from 1998 to 2005 and Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Scientific Committee from 2003 to 2005. He was also International Chairman of the Conservative&#x27;s Central Office from 1999 to 2000 and the Governor of the Foundation for Western Democracy from 1998 to 2000.

Outside of high office, Page won the Lords and Commons Motor car race at Brands Hatch and Donnington on three occasions. He was one of only 13 Conservative MPs who spoke and voted against the decision to invade Iraq (18 March 2003) and the way the re-construction progressed. He stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 General Election due to his wife&#x27;s ill health.

==Later life==

He was Governor of the Royal Masonic School from 1984 to 1995 and from 1999 to 2013. He was Honorary Treasurer of The Leukaemia Research Fund from 1991 to 1995, and has been Chairman of Keep Southwater Green since 2015. He was the master of the Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers.

<text>Sir James Edward Thornton Paice, DL (born 24 April 1949) is a British politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South East Cambridgeshire from 1987 to 2015, when he declined to run for reelection and retired from politics. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Minister of State at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2010 until being removed in a government reshuffle in 2012. Following his service in government, Paice was knighted in September 2012.

==Early and personal life==
Born in Felixstowe, Suffolk, Paice went to the independent Framlingham College. At the Writtle Agricultural College, he received a National Diploma in Agriculture in 1970. He was a farm manager from 1970 to 1973. From 1973 to 1979, he was a farmer and contractor. From 1979 to 1987, he was Training Manager at Framlingham Management and Training Services. At United Framlingham Farmers Ltd, he was non-executive Director from 1987 to 1989, then Director from 1989 to 1994. From 1976 until 1987, he was on Suffolk Coastal District Council, becoming the youngest ever chairman in 1983.

Paice married Ava Patterson in 1973. They have two sons.

==Parliamentary career==
Paice contested the Caernarfon seat for the Conservatives in the 1979 general election but lost to incumbent Dafydd Wigley of Plaid Cymru. At the 1987 general election he was chosen by the Conservatives to replace their incumbent member of parliament for South East Cambridgeshire, former Foreign Secretary Francis Pym, who was stepping down. Paice won the seat with a majority of 17,502.

At Westminster Paice first served as Secretary of the Backbench Employment Committee from 1988 to 1989 and of the Backbench Horticulture and Markets Sub-Committee (1988–1989). He was also a member of the Employment Select Committee from 1987 until 1989.

Paice was made a minor member of the government in December 1989 as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Baroness Trumpington. A year later he became the PPS for John Gummer, who was then the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1990–1993) and later Secretary of State for the Environment (1993–1994). In July 1994 he was promoted to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Employment and served until the Conservative defeat in the 1997 general election.

In opposition, Paice became a spokesman for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1997–2001) and later on Home Affairs (2001–2003). Under the leadership of Michael Howard, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Home, Constitutional and Legal Affairs. From September 2004 until his return to government, he served as Shadow Minister for Agriculture, a post he later took up in government.

After the 2010 general election, Paice was appointed Minister of State for Agriculture and Food at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. He served until 4 September 2012 when he was removed as part of a cabinet reshuffle.

On 10 July 2012, during an interview with BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Farming Today, Paice he admitted that he did not know how much a pint of milk cost. Nevertheless, in October 2013 he was appointed chairman of the Glasgow-based First Milk farmers’ cooperative on an annual salary of £125,000, for which it was proposed that he work one day a week. Under Paice&#x27;s chairmanship, the co-operative announced in January 2015 that payments to dairy farmers would be deferred by two weeks and that 1.5 pence per litre would be deducted from the payments to pay for “capital investment”. It also announced that from February 2015, it would pay its members an average 21.4 pence per litre – 10p per litre less than some major supermarkets criticised for the low levels of their payments to dairy farmers for milk.

On 8 March 2013, Paice announced that he would stand down at the next general election.

<text>Nicholas Douglas Palmer (born 5 February 1950) is a British politician, translator and computer scientist. He was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire from 1997 until he lost the seat at the 2010 general election to Conservative Anna Soubry, by 390 votes.

Described by Andrew Roth as &quot;quietly effective&quot;, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State, Margaret Beckett, in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until April 2005. He then became PPS to the Minister of State, Malcolm Wicks, first in the Department of Trade and Industry, and later in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform until Wicks stood down in October 2008.

==Early life==
Palmer&#x27;s father was a translator/editor and his mother was a language teacher. He is the cousin of Anthony Palmer, a former Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff.

Palmer attended International Schools in Copenhagen and Vienna. He was awarded an MSc at Copenhagen University and a PhD in Mathematics from Birkbeck College, University of London. He also studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he researched artificial intelligence and language translation.

==Professional life==
Palmer speaks six languages, and has worked as a professional translator of Danish and German for the European Commission and other clients.

He was born with a cleft palate and was the first such person to enter Parliament.

As a computer scientist, he developed the COMPACT clinical trials package for the Medical Research Council. Joining the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Ciba-Geigy, he became head of Novartis Internet Service when Ciba-Geigy merged with Sandoz to form Novartis.

==Board and computer wargames==
Palmer has written three books about board wargames (&quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot; (1977), &quot;The Best of Board Wargaming&quot; (1980), and &quot;Beyond the Arcade: Adventures and Wargames on Your Computer&quot; (1984)). He designed and developed a computer game about the Battle of Britain, named &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot;. Palmer still attends international conventions, winning the &quot;Diplomacy&quot; championship at the World Boardgaming Championships in 2007, as well as giving a seminar in 2008 comparing the traits needed to succeed in wargaming to the traits needed to succeed in politics.

He co-founded and edited &quot;Flagship&quot; magazine in 1983, which focused on play-by-mail games. A keen card player, he has represented the House of Commons at bridge.

==Parliamentary career==
Palmer joined the Labour Party on his twenty-first birthday and was selected as the Labour candidate for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Chelsea in the 1983 general election. Prior to contesting Broxtowe, he edited and published a magazine to represent the views of ordinary Labour party members – &quot;Grass Roots&quot;.

===Legislation and Committee Work===
While an MP, he served on a number of Select committees including the European Scrutiny Committee, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, and the Treasury Committee. and also served as a member of the Justice Committee.
He suggested TV Licence exemption for over-75s which was then adopted by the government, along with similar measures like free bus passes for the elderly.

In January 1998, Palmer introduced a bill under the Ten Minute Rule, amending the Firearms act 1968 and raising the age for possession of air weapons, especially to prevent malicious use against pets.
In April 2000, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to presume consent for organ donation, a measure still being considered which could increase transplants by 25%.

In January 2002, he introduced a 10-minute rule bill advocating Identity Cards which was adopted by the Government. He subsequently brokered a deal to get the government&#x27;s version through the Lords.

He campaigned for five years for bells to be fitted to all new bicycles in response to a petition from his constituents. A bill was passed making them compulsory from 1 May 2004.

He introduced a bill about fine print, requiring a minimum size of print in documents, especially those relating to advertising and contracts.

In December 2005, he introduced another 10-minute rule bill intended to ensure speed camera warning signs displayed the limit they enforced.

In May 2008, he introduced an amendment to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requiring that &quot;strictly neutral information&quot; be provided in cases of foetal abnormality. This was based on his parents&#x27; experience of the expert advice from pioneering surgeon Archibald McIndoe who successfully reconstructed his cleft palate.

He gave speeches in the Commons on animal welfare issues and in December 2009 he was one of 8 cross-party supporters of a bill introduced by Nigel Waterson to &quot;make provision for residents of care homes and sheltered accommodation to keep domestic pets in certain circumstances.&quot;

Based on his experience as a computer software developer, he spoke against the terms of the Digital Economy Bill and joined Tom Watson and Austin Mitchell in leading a Labour rebellion against its third reading.

===Interest Groups===
Palmer belonged to an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Animal Welfare, Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (FRAME) and World Government. He is a member of the East Midlands Labour Group and serves on the Executive of the Labour Friends of Israel. He helped organise the visit of the Dalai Lama to Britain in 2008, organising meetings and a special exhibit of a mandala in the House of Commons.

With his secretary, Philipa Coughlan (with sons Nick and Sean) and fellow MP, Liz Blackman, he compiled a book of recipes favoured by MPs. For example, Tony Blair&#x27;s recipe was for Meatball and Tomato Sauce while speaker Betty Boothroyd preferred Stewed Oxtail. Nick Palmer&#x27;s own recipe was for Swiss-style potatoes – Berner Roesti.

===Constituency===

Palmer was one of many new Labour MPs elected in what was a landslide election for Labour in 1997. He held the seat comfortably with an increased majority at the 2001 election, and again with a reduced majority in 2005 election. An opinion piece suggested that part of the reason that Palmer had held his seat was due to his high constituency work rate. In the 2010 election, the seat was lost to the Conservative candidate Anna Soubry, reflecting a national swing.

While an MP, he responded to a &quot;very high&quot; percentage of constituents&#x27; letters, addressing matters of local concern such as open-cast mining and the development of the local Nottingham tramway and in February 2008 he asked about &quot;proposals to build on virtually the entire green belt&quot; in Broxtowe at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. In June 2008 he asked the Department for Transport about the second phase of the tram/train trials. He campaigned for and organised a bus service to link Kimberley with the Nottingham tram at Phoenix Park.
==Post-parliamentary career==
A month after losing his seat in the 2010 general election, Palmer became the first ex-MP to sign on for unemployment benefit. He said this was partly to keep his national insurance contributions continuous and partly to explore for himself what the unemployment services are like. Palmer described the experience as sensitive but said he had received plenty of helpful suggestions and was favourably impressed. In September 2010, he became Director of International and Corporate Affairs for the BUAV.

In September 2011 Palmer contributed to the book &quot;What next for Labour?&quot;. He wrote two pieces, one entitled &quot;Student Fees: A Constructive Response&quot; and the other &quot;Animal Welfare: The Neglected Swing Issue&quot;. He is the patron of Cats Protection. In August 2010, pursuing his interest in animal welfare, he joined the Cruelty Free International as their Director of International and Corporate Relations. He then joined Compassion in World Farming to head the UK branch of the charity which campaigns for the welfare of farm animals.

He stood again for the Broxtowe seat at the 2015 general election but failed to regain the seat. In September 2016 he intervened in the leadership battle between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. Palmer described himself as one who considered the 1997–2010 Labour government as &#x27;very successful&#x27; but &#x27;blighted by the disaster of Iraq&#x27;. He called on members and parliamentarians to give Corbyn a &#x27;decent chance&#x27;.

On 2 May 2019, he was elected to Waverley Borough Council in the Godalming Binscombe Ward. He led the Labour group on the council and chaired the local party, receiving an award for endurance on the 50th anniversary of his party membership. He resigned from Waverley Council in August 2024 where he was said to have been &quot;one of the most popular Waverley members&quot;.

<text>Anne Claude de Tubières-Grimoard de Pestels de Lévis, &quot;comte de Caylus&quot;, marquis d&#x27;Esternay, baron de Bransac (Anne Claude Philippe; 31 October, 16925 September 1765), was a French antiquarian, proto-archaeologist and man of letters.

Born in Paris, he was the eldest son of Lieutenant-General Anne de Tubières, comte de Caylus. His mother, Marthe-Marguerite de Villette de Mursay, comtesse de Caylus (1673–1729), was the daughter of vice-admiral Philippe, Marquis de Villette-Mursay.
His younger brother was Charles de Tubières de Caylus, who became a naval officer and governor of Martinique.

He was a cousin of Mme de Maintenon, who brought Marthe-Marguerite up like her own daughter. Marthe-Marguerite wrote valuable &quot;Souvenirs&quot; of the court of Louis XIV; these were edited by Voltaire (1770), and by many later editors.

==Career==
While a young man, Caylus distinguished himself in the campaigns of the French army, from 1709 to 1714. After the peace of Rastatt (1714) he spent some time in travelling in Italy, Greece, the Levant, England and Germany, and devoted much attention to the study and collection of antiquities. He became an active member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture and of the Académie des Inscriptions. Chief among his antiquarian works must be the profusely illustrated &quot;Recueil d&#x27;antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises&quot; (6 vols., Paris, 1752–1755), which was mined by the designers of Neoclassical arts for the rest of the century. His &quot;Numismata Aurea Imperatorum Romanorum&quot;, treats only the gold coinage of the Roman emperors, those worthy of collection by a &quot;grand seigneur&quot;. His concentration on the object itself marked a step towards modern connoisseurship, and in his &quot;Mémoire&quot; (1755) on the method of encaustic painting, the ancient technique of painting with wax as a medium mentioned by Pliny the Elder, he claimed to have rediscovered the method. Denis Diderot, who was no friend to Caylus, maintained that the proper method had been found by J.-B. Bachelier.
Caylus was an admirable and prolific etcher. He worked chiefly from drawings by Italian and French masters, including examples from the collection of Pierre Crozat and the &quot;Cabinet du Roi&quot; (the collection of the King); he also made many etchings from drawings by his friend Antoine Watteau and the sculptor Edmé Bouchardon. He caused engravings to be made, at his own expense, of Bartoli&#x27;s copies from ancient pictures. His publications &quot;Nouveaux sujets de peinture et de sculpture&quot; (1755) and &quot;Tableaux tirés de l&#x27;Iliade, de l&#x27;Odyssée, et de l&#x27;Enéide&quot; (1757) consist of descriptions of subjects from classical literature for the inspiration of contemporary artists and their patrons. 

His cultural interests were not confined to the arts of Classical Antiquity but extended to Gallic monuments, such as the megaliths of Aurille (Poitou), of which he commissioned drawings in 1762.

He encouraged artists whose reputations were still in the making, and befriended the connoisseur and collector of prints and drawings Pierre-Jean Mariette when Mariette was only twenty-two, but his patronage was somewhat capricious. Diderot expressed this fact in an epigram in his &quot;Salon&quot; of 1765: &quot;Death has delivered us from the cruellest of connoisseurs.&quot; Caylus had quite another side to his character. He had a thorough acquaintance with the gayest and most disreputable sides of Parisian life, and left a number of more or less witty stories dealing with it. These were collected (Amsterdam, 1787) as his &quot;Œuvres badines complètes&quot;. The best of them is the &quot;Histoire de M. Guillaume, cocher&quot; (c. 1730). His &quot;Contes&quot;, hovering between French fairy tales and oriental fantasies, between conventional charm and moral satire, have been collected and were published in 2005; they were originally published as &quot;les Féeries nouvelles&quot; (1741), &quot;les Contes orientaux&quot; (1743), &quot;Cinq contes de fées&quot; (1745), plus two posthumous stories published in 1775.

The &#x27;, published in 1805, is of very doubtful authenticity. See also E. and J. de Goncourt, &quot;Portraits intimes du XVIIIième siècle&quot;; Charles Nisard&#x27;s edition of the &#x27; (1877); and a notice by O. Uzanne prefixed to a volume of his &quot;Facties&quot; (1879).

===Items of Caylus&#x27; collection===
===Fairy tales===
Folklorist Andrew Lang published some of Comte de Caylus&#x27;s tales in his book &quot;The Green Fairy Book&quot;, as part of his collection of color fairy books. These are:
*Rosanella (&quot;Rosanie&quot;)
*Heart of Ice (&quot;Le prince Courtebotte et la princesse Zibeline&quot;)
*Sylvain and Jocosa (&quot;Tourlou et Rirette&quot;)
*The Yellow Bird (&quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Jaune&quot;) – inserted in the narrative of Sylvain and Jocosa
*Fairy Gifts (&quot;Les dons&quot;)

The following tales were also published by Andrew Lang, but without the proper authorship:
*Prince Narcissus and the Princess Potentilla (&quot;La Princesse Pimprenella et Le Prince Romarin&quot;)
*Prince Featherhead and the Princess Celandine (&quot;Le Prince Muguet et la Princesse Zaza&quot;)
*Prince Vivien and the Princess Placida (&quot;Nonchalante et Papillon&quot;)

British dramatist James Planché also translated the following of de Caylus&#x27;s tales into English:
*Princess Minute and King Floridor (&quot;La princesse Minutie et le roi Floridor&quot;)
*The Impossible Enchantment (&quot;L&#x27;enchantement impossible&quot;)
*Bleuette and Coquelicot (&quot;Bleuette et Coquelicot&quot;)

The tale &quot;Mignonette&quot; was also translated into English as &quot;Prince Chaffinch&quot;.

<text>Owen William Paterson (born 24 June 1956) is a British former politician who served as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 2010 to 2012 and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2012 to 2014 under Prime Minister David Cameron. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Shropshire from 1997 until his resignation in 2021. Paterson was also the President of the Northern Ireland Conservatives.

Paterson was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron in 2007 as Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. During the formation of the Coalition Government in 2010, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Northern Ireland Secretary, where he remained until being moved to Environment Secretary in 2012. He was dismissed as Environment Secretary by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of the 2014 Cabinet reshuffle, and was replaced by Liz Truss. After returning to the backbenches, Paterson became a leading supporter of Brexit as a member of the European Research Group (ERG).

Paterson resigned from the House of Commons on 5 November 2021 amid controversy surrounding a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that found that he had broken paid advocacy rules.

==Early life and career==
Paterson was born in Whitchurch, Shropshire, and grew up on his family&#x27;s farm. He attended Abberley Hall School and Radley College, before reading History at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He then went on to the National Leathersellers College (now the Institute for Creative Leather Technologies at the University of Northampton).

He joined his family business, British Leather Company, in 1979, becoming Sales Director in 1983 and managing director from 1993 to 1999. He was President of COTANCE (the Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community), the European Tanners Confederation, from 1996 to 1998. He was a Director of Parsons and Sons leather company in Halesowen in the 1990s. Paterson is a Freeman of the City of London and a Liveryman of the Leathersellers&#x27; Company.

At the 1992 general election, Paterson contested Wrexham, but the incumbent Labour MP extended his lead with a 2.4% swing.

==Parliamentary career==
Paterson was first elected as the Member of Parliament for North Shropshire at the 1997 general election with a majority of 2,195 and increased his majority at each subsequent election, up to 22,949 in 2019.

He served on several committees, including the Welsh Affairs Committee (1997–2001), the European Standing Committee (1998–2001), and the Agriculture Committee (2000–01). Paterson is a supporter of the Royal Irish Regiment, which has been based in his constituency at Tern Hill.

===Early front bench posts===
From 2001 to 2003, Paterson served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition. He was Shadow Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Minister from 2003 to 2005. As agriculture spokesman he campaigned for the dairy industry. He visited Michigan, Maryland and Washington to discuss bovine TB policy, writing extensively on the issue facing the UK. He travelled all over the North Atlantic to produce a Green paper on Fisheries. Paterson joined the crew of the &quot;Kiroan&quot;, one of the few remaining trawlers out of Fleetwood, Lancashire, to view the fishing practices that have been created by the EU&#x27;s Common Fisheries Policy. He wrote the Green paper &quot;Consultation on a National Policy on Fisheries Management in U.K. Waters&quot;.

Paterson served as Shadow Minister for Transport from 2005 to 2007. Whilst he was Shadow Minister for Roads, Paterson researched relevant best practice and the latest ideas from Europe and North America.

===Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland===
Paterson was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 2 July 2007.

He negotiated an agreement between the Conservative Party and the Ulster Unionist Party to re-establish the traditional links between the two parties, which had been broken in 1972. This included running joint Conservative/UUP candidates for the 2009 European and 2010 general elections.

News of this alliance was praised by several Conservatives, including Iain Dale and ConservativeHome. The renewed alliance caused the UUP&#x27;s only MP, Sylvia Hermon, to resign from the UUP. Lady Hermon retained her seat against the Ulster Conservatives and Unionists in the 2010 Westminster election. The UUP lost seats at the assembly elections the following year.

===Secretary of State for Northern Ireland===
Paterson was appointed as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Coalition Government on 12 May 2010. He was created a Privy Councillor on 13 May 2010.

One of his first tasks was overseeing the publication and delivery of the Saville Report on the events of Bloody Sunday in January 1972, which led to an apology by the Prime Minister David Cameron. He worked with the Treasury to deliver his promise of a consultation on the devolution of the power to reduce the rate of corporation tax to Stormont. Paterson stated that &quot;Rebalancing and rebuilding the economy is critical to the future prosperity of Northern Ireland and it is one of the Government&#x27;s key priorities for Northern Ireland.&quot; He has been outspoken on the issue of integrated education in Northern Ireland. Currently 95% of Northern Ireland pupils attend a segregated school. Paterson believes segregated education is not working; in October 2010, he said: “there&#x27;s a school in Belfast with no pupils and there&#x27;s a school in Belfast with more staff than pupils. That&#x27;s just a criminal waste of public money. We cannot go on bearing the cost of segregation and I don&#x27;t see why the British taxpayer should continue to subsidise segregation.&quot;

Paterson was the first cabinet member to publicly oppose the Coalition Government&#x27;s Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, defying David Cameron and ministerial convention.

===Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs===
Paterson was appointed Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in September 2012.

Despite his voting record &quot;moderately for&quot; laws to stop climate change, he is a climate change sceptic, and did not accept scientist David MacKay&#x27;s offer of a briefing on climate change science. Prior to being appointed at DEFRA, he described wind turbines as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;useless&quot; and called for the end of &quot;Soviet&quot; subsidies that supported their development. As an alternative to wind power, he supported the use of fracking. At the 2013 Conservative party conference, he argued that there were advantages to climate change such as fewer deaths caused by cold weather and the ability to grow food further North. During his time in office, Paterson cut funding for climate change adaptation by approximately 40%. In 2014, the outgoing Environment Agency chair Chris Smith said that flood defence budget cuts had left the agency underfunded and hampered its ability to prevent and respond to flooding in the UK. When asked in a 2013 BBC interview about the alleged failure of a badger cull he had been responsible for, Paterson replied that &quot;the badgers have moved the goalposts.&quot;

Paterson voted and spoke strongly against the fox hunting ban, in one speech likening supporters of the bill to Nazis. Coming as Justine Greening was removed as Transport Secretary, Paterson&#x27;s appointment was widely considered to be part of a move back towards the expansion of Heathrow Airport, given his support for aviation. Paterson stated on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions?&quot; in June 2013 that &quot;the temperature has not changed in the last 17 years ...&quot;.

Paterson is known as a strong supporter of genetically modified food (GM) technology. Even before he acceded to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in September 2012, he spoke at length in June of the same year at the Rothamsted Research facility and invited GMO innovators to take root in the UK. In December 2012, he labelled consumer opposition to the technology as a &quot;complete nonsense&quot;. In October 2013, he branded opponents of the development of golden rice enriched with vitamin A &quot;wicked&quot;.

Paterson was mentioned by journalist Benedict Brogan as a possible replacement on the European Commission when the term of Baroness Ashton expired. Paterson was one of three MPs to leave the cabinet as part of the re-shuffle on 15 July 2014, and was succeeded by Liz Truss as Environment Secretary. His departure was widely attributed to his botched handling of the summer floods and the badger cull. Paterson praises Britain&#x27;s shale gas reserves as &quot;one unexpected and potentially huge windfall.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in December 2014 that Paterson had spoken the previous October at a meeting of the London Swinton Group, which opposes non-white immigration and calls for the return of capital punishment.

==Views on the European Union==
Retiring to the backbenches Paterson, long known for his Euroscepticism, supported the successful Leave.EU campaign. Throughout the campaign he was an active voice, setting out the reasons in his constituency for a decision to go it alone. On 26 June 2016, he spoke about his long friendship with colleague Sir Bill Cash MP, who has shared his ambition for Brexit. Earlier in the year, he spoke at an international forum outlining his vision for Britain outside the Union.

In 2015, Paterson joined John Redwood to found internal pressure group Conservatives for Britain, which took pride of place at the party conference in Manchester pledging on the fringe to strive for independence from European interventionism; it formed the backbone of the Conservative effort for Leave. &quot;If there are individuals in the cabinet who are not happy with the deal, they should be allowed to campaign&quot;, Paterson told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He continued to be critical of David Cameron&#x27;s attempts to negotiate a settlement with the European Union over net migration figures, an issue that featured highly in the referendum campaign. Following Paterson&#x27;s return to the backbenches he remained an outspoken critic of the European Union, and was on the political advisory board of pro-hard Brexit advocacy group Leave Means Leave.

In 2014, Paterson established UK 2020, an independent centre-right think tank, to develop policies to address challenging and complex public policy areas. In his role as chairman, he delivered a number of speeches and written op-eds in favour of GM crops, and against the European Union and &quot;exaggerated&quot; climate change forecasts. He announced in October 2019 that UK 2020 would be shut down.

Paterson was also a subscribed supporter of the Conservative pro-Brexit European Research Group.

==Advocacy and breach of Commons rules==

Paterson first became involved with the healthcare company Randox, based in Northern Ireland, whilst he was Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary before 2010. Contact continued when he became a minister and was campaigning for corporation tax to be devolved in Northern Ireland. In 2015, he began working as a part-time consultant for Randox, with the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments being advised at the time that the role &quot;may involve discussions with ministers&quot;. In 2019, Paterson earned £8,333 a month for a monthly commitment of 16 hours as a consultant for Randox. In March 2020, Randox was awarded a £133 million contract from the Department of Health and Social Care to produce testing kits (at a cost of £49 each) during the coronavirus pandemic, without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work. in April 2020, Paterson represented Randox in a call with James Bethell, the minister responsible for awarding contracts to the private sector during the pandemic. The government was later unable to find any minutes of the meeting, which the Commons Speaker noted would be expected to occur in any meeting between a minister and a business. A further £347 million contract was awarded to Randox six months later without other companies being able to bid. Paterson also receives £12,000 for 24 hours work per year from Lynn&#x27;s Country Foods Ltd, a Northern Ireland-based processor and distributor of sausages.

In October 2021, Paterson was found by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to have breached paid advocacy rules for making three approaches to the Food Standards Agency and four approaches to the Department for International Development in relation to Randox and seven approaches to the Food Standards Agency in relation to Lynn&#x27;s Country Foods. The Commissioner said Paterson had &quot;repeatedly used his privileged position to benefit two companies for whom he was a paid consultant, and that this has brought the house into disrepute&quot; and that &quot;no previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests&quot;. The Commons Select Committee on Standards recommended Paterson be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days. Paterson said: &quot;The process I have been subjected to does not comply with natural justice. I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me.&quot;

A motion to carry out the recommendations of the Committee and suspend Paterson was due to be voted on by Parliament. Had suspension been approved, a recall petition would have been triggered in his constituency. An amendment to the motion was put forward by Conservative backbencher Andrea Leadsom to delay consideration of Paterson&#x27;s suspension and to set up a new committee to investigate the disciplinary process for MPs. Such an amendment was noted in the press as being unprecedented. The government of Boris Johnson supported the amendment and issued a three-line whip. The amendment passed 250–232 with the support of Sammy Wilson of the DUP and Paterson himself, with 13 Conservative MPs voting against, and 97 absent or abstaining. The duly amended motion was then passed 248–221. The amended motion:

# noted concerns about potential defects in the standards system;
# resolved to appoint a Select Committee chaired by John Whittingdale with four other Conservative MPs, and with 3 Labour and 1 SNP MPs, to give recommendations on whether to give MPs a right of appeal similar to employees, whether to reconsider the case against Paterson, and how the standards rules should be revised to be &quot;compatible with natural justice&quot;.

It became apparent that the opposition parties were not willing to participate in the new Select Committee. Faced with heavy criticism in the media and from MPs of all parties, the government reversed its position and announced that a vote would still take place on whether Paterson should be suspended. Following that decision, on 5 November 2021, Paterson announced his decision to resign from Parliament, forestalling any further votes and the possibility of a recall petition, and making a by-election inevitable. After a further debate on 16 November, Parliament passed a motion accepting the findings of the original report that recommended Paterson be suspended. The by-election was held on 16 December 2021, when the previously ultra-safe seat of North Shropshire was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate Helen Morgan.

Paterson took legal action against the British government in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), claiming that the parliamentary investigation into his conduct was unfair. In September 2024, the ECHR rejected his claim.

== Overseas visits ==
In January 2019, it emerged that Paterson had received £39,000 of funding for overseas trips from the thinktank UK 2020, of which he was the chairman and sole director. Trips funded by the thinktank included speaking at two rightwing thinktanks in the US, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation. MPs are required to declare the source of funds for any overseas visit worth more than £300. Although Paterson had declared the trips, the Labour Party called for a parliamentary investigation: shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett wrote to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, &quot;Paterson appears to be both the recipient of donations and the controlling intermediary through which they are paid&quot;. He said without information on the true source of donations, &quot;the register of members&#x27; interests is unable to fulfil its vital purpose&quot;. Paterson stated that &quot;All the expenses incurred on these trips have been declared according to parliamentary rules&quot;, but has not confirmed the original source of the funding. In October 2019, he announced the body&#x27;s forthcoming shutdown.

==Personal life==
Paterson married Rose Ridley, the daughter of Matthew White Ridley, 4th Viscount Ridley, and sister of Matt Ridley, in 1980. They have two sons, Felix and Ned, and a daughter, Evie. He lives near Ellesmere, north Shropshire, and also has a house in Drôme, France.

Paterson is a horse rider and racer, and has ridden across Turkmenistan and Mongolia. His daughter, Evie, is an eventer who won the British Junior Eventing Championships in 2008, aged 16. In January 2018, Paterson fell from a horse while riding and broke three vertebrae in his back.

Paterson&#x27;s wife Rose died on 24 June 2020, her husband&#x27;s birthday. Her body was found in the early hours of the morning in woodland at their country house, Shellbrook Hill. The coroner later ruled her death to be suicide by hanging.

==Honours==
Paterson was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 2010 upon his appointment to the British Cabinet as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. This gave him the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

<text>Władysław Albert Anders (11 August 1892 – 12 May 1970) was a Polish military officer and politician, and prominent member of the Polish government-in-exile in London.

Born in Krośniewice-Błonie, then part of the Russian Empire, he served in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and later joined the Polish Land Forces after Poland regained its independence in 1918.

During World War II, Anders was captured by Soviet forces and imprisoned, but he was later released to form a Polish Army to fight against the Germans alongside the Red Army. He led the Polish II Corps throughout the Italian Campaign, including the capture of Monte Cassino. 

After the war, Anders was deprived of his citizenship and military rank by the Soviet-installed communist government of Poland. He remained in Britain, working for the Polish Government in Exile and various charities. In 1989, after the collapse of communist rule in Poland, his citizenship and military rank were posthumously reinstated.

==Biography==
===Before World War II===
Anders was born on 11 August 1892 to his father Albert Anders and mother Elizabeth (maiden name Tauchert) in the village of Krośniewice–Błonie, west of Warsaw, in what was then a part of the Russian Empire. Both his parents were of Baltic-German origin and he was baptised as a member of the Protestant Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland. He had three brothers – Karol, Tadeusz and Jerzy, all of whom also went on to pursue careers in the military.

Anders attended a technical high school in Warsaw and later studied at Riga Technical University, where he became a member of the Polish student fraternity . After graduation Anders was accepted into the Russian Military School for reserve officers. As a young officer, he served in the 1st Krechowiecki Lancers Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I.

When Poland regained its independence in November 1918, Anders joined the newly formed Polish Land Forces. During the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921 he commanded the 15th Poznań Uhlans Regiment and was awarded the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari. After the war Anders continued his military education in France at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr and upon graduation he returned to Poland, where he served on the general staff of the Polish Army under General Tadeusz Rozwadowski (Chief of the General Staff from 1920 to 1921).

Anders opposed Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May Coup in Poland in 1926, but unlike Jordan-Rozwadowski, he avoided persecution by the Sanation regime that assumed power after the coup. Piłsudski made him the commander of a cavalry brigade in 1931 and he was promoted to the rank of general three years later.

===World War II===
Anders commanded the Nowogródzka Cavalry Brigade during the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was immediately called into action, taking part in the Battle of Mława. After the collapse of the Polish Northern Front the brigade withdrew towards Warsaw, and also fought heavy battles against the Germans around Mińsk Mazowiecki and in the second phase of the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski. After learning about the Soviet invasion of Poland, Anders retreated south in the direction of Lwów, hoping to reach the Hungarian or Romanian border, but was intercepted by Soviet forces and captured on 29 September, after being wounded twice.

Anders was initially jailed in Lwów and subsequently transferred to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow on 29 February 1940. During his imprisonment, he was interrogated, tortured and unsuccessfully urged to join the Red Army.

After the launch of Operation Barbarossa and the signing of the Sikorski-Maisky agreement, Anders was released by the Soviets with the aim of forming a Polish Army to fight against the Germans alongside the Red Army. Continued friction with the Soviets over political issues as well as shortages of weapons, food and clothing, led to the eventual evacuation of Anders&#x27; men – known as Anders&#x27; Army – together with a sizeable contingent of Polish civilians who had been deported to the USSR from Soviet-occupied Poland, via the Persian Corridor into Iran, Iraq, and finally into Mandatory Palestine. The evacuation, which took place in March 1942, was based on the British-Soviet-Polish understanding. The soldiers involved were evacuated from the Soviet Union and made their way through Iran to British-ruled Palestine, where they passed under British command. Here, Anders formed and led the Polish II Corps, while continuing to agitate for the release of Polish nationals still in the Soviet Union.

The Polish II Corps became a major tactical and operational unit of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. Anders commanded the Corps throughout the Italian Campaign, capturing Monte Cassino on 18 May 1944, Ancona on 18 July 1944; afterward his Corps took part in the breaking of the Gothic Line and in the final spring offensive.

The morale of the Polish forces was weakened by the outcome of the Yalta Conference which ended on 11 February, where the British and Americans, without consultation with the Poles, had decided to give a major part of the 1921–1939 Polish territories to the Soviet Union. When Anders asked for his unit to be withdrawn from the front line, Winston Churchill told him &quot;you [the Poles] are no longer needed&quot; but the American and British front line commanders—Generals Richard McCreery, Mark Wayne Clark and Field Marshal Harold Alexander—requested Anders that the Polish units remain in their positions, as they had no troops to replace them. Anders eventually decided to keep the Polish units engaged. So they fought together with the Allies in the Battle of Bologna.

===After World War II===
After the war, the Soviet-installed communist government of Poland deprived him of Polish citizenship and of his military rank. Anders had, however, always been unwilling to return to a Soviet-dominated Poland where he probably would have been jailed and possibly executed, and remained in Britain. He was prominent in the Polish Government in Exile in London and became General Inspector of the Armed Forces, as well as working on behalf of various charities and welfare organisations. His book about his experiences during the Second World War, &quot;An Army in Exile&quot;, was first published by MacMillan &amp; Co, London, in 1949.

Anders died in London on 12 May 1970, where his body lay in state at St Andrew Bobola Church, and many of his former soldiers and their families came to pay their last respects. He was buried, in accordance with his wishes, amongst his fallen soldiers from the 2nd Polish Corps at the Polish War Cemetery at Monte Cassino in Italy. After the collapse of communist rule in Poland in 1989, his citizenship and military rank were posthumously reinstated.

Many personal effects which once belonged to Anders are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London. In June 2021, General Anders&#x27;s bust designed by Andrzej Pitynski was officially unveiled at London&#x27;s National Army Museum.

===Private life===
Anders was married twice. He had two children with his first wife Irena Maria Jordan-Krąkowska (born 1894, died 1981) – a daughter, Anna (born 1919, died 2006) and a son, George (born 1927, died 1983).

In 1948, he married the actress and singer Irena Jarosiewicz, better known under her stage name Renata Bogdańska, with whom he had a daughter, Anna Maria (born in 1950).

<doc id="433783" wikidata="Q5982575" url="?curid=433783" title="Ian Pearson">
<text>Ian Phares Pearson (born 5 April 1959) is a British Labour Party politician who was a member of parliament (MP) from 1994 until 2010, representing Dudley West from 1994 until 1997, and then Dudley South from 1997 until his retirement from the House of Commons at the 2010 general election. He served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 2008 to 2010.

==Early life==
Pearson was educated at Brierley Hill Grammar School and Balliol College, Oxford (BA Philosophy, Politics, and Economics) and the University of Warwick (MA, PhD).

==Political career==
Having unsuccessfully contested Bexhill and Battle in the 1983 general election, Pearson entered parliament for Dudley West in a by-election in December 1994, winning a Conservative seat left vacant by the death of John Blackburn in October of that year. He won the seat with nearly 70% of the votes, with the Conservative candidate receiving less than 20%.

Boundary changes created the new constituency of Dudley South in 1997 which he then represented.

Pearson was Parliamentary private secretary to the Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson from 1997 until Robinson resigned in 1998. In 2001 he returned to the government as a whip. In 2002 he moved to the Northern Ireland Office as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. After the 2005 general election he was promoted to Minister of State for Trade in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

In the PM&#x27;s 2006 reshuffle, he was appointed as Minister of State for Climate Change and Environment at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; published on 5 January 2007, Pearson courted considerable controversy by publicly criticising several airlines, particularly Ryanair, for failing to pull their weight in lowering UK carbon emissions. He described Ryanair as &quot;the irresponsible face of capitalism&quot;. In response, Michael O&#x27;Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, claimed Ryanair had made a considerable investment in environmentally friendly planes and technologies and had the lowest fuel use per passenger figures of any British airline. O&#x27;Leary described Pearson as &quot;silly&quot;, adding that Pearson &quot;hadn&#x27;t a clue what he [was] talking about&quot;.

On 29 June 2007, Pearson was moved in Gordon Brown&#x27;s first reshuffle to become a Minister of State in the newly created Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills under Secretary of State John Denham. Whilst there he was criticised for not doing anything to avert a funding crisis at the Science and Technology Facilities Council hitting UK Astronomy and particle physics. In Gordon Brown&#x27;s next reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Pearson was moved to the Treasury as Economic Secretary, also becoming Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Economics and Business. In the June 2009 reshuffle Pearson retained his role at the Treasury but lost his business role as the department was merged to create the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

On 21 January 2010, Pearson announced that he would not contest the next general election.

Pearson is a non-executive chairman of EQTEC PLC, an Irish multinational gasification company rolling out successful technology in several countries.

<doc id="433798" wikidata="Q8923598" url="?curid=433798" title="2nd Polish Corps (Polish Armed Forces in the West)">
<text>The 2nd Polish Corps (), 1943–1947, was a major tactical and operational unit of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. It was commanded by Lieutenant General Władysław Anders and fought with distinction in the Italian Campaign, in particular at the Battle of Monte Cassino. By the end of 1945, the corps had grown to well over 100,000 soldiers.

==History==
Victims of Soviet deportations from occupied Poland in 1939–40 had been processed by the NKVD and sent to prison or exile in Siberia. The Nazi-Soviet pact of August 1939 effectively ended on 22 June 1941 when the German Wehrmacht invaded the USSR. The release of many thousands of former citizens of Poland (including Ukrainians and Belarusians) from the Soviet Gulags, following the signing of the Polish-Russian Military Agreement on 14 August 1941, allowed for the creation of a Polish Army on Soviet soil. Its first commander, General Michał Tokarzewski, began the task of forming this army in the Soviet village of Totskoye on 17 August. The commander ultimately chosen by Władysław Sikorski to lead the new army, Lieutenant General Władysław Anders, had just been released from the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, on 4 August, and did not issue his first orders or announce his appointment as commander until 22 August.

This army grew over the following two years and provided the bulk of the units and troops of the Polish II Corps.

The Polish II Corps was created in 1943 from various units fighting alongside the Allies in all theatres of war. The 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division was formed in the Middle East from smaller Polish units fighting in Egypt and Tobruk, as well as the Polish Army in the East that was evacuated from the Soviet Union through the Persian Corridor. Its creation was based on the British Allied Forces Act 1940, which allowed the Allied units of the exiled government of Poland to be grouped in one theatre of war. However, the British High Command never agreed to incorporate the exiled Polish Air Force into the Corps.
In February 1944, the Polish II Corps was transferred from Egypt to Italy, where it became an independent part of the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese. During 1944–45, the Corps fought with distinction in the Italian campaign, during the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino in May 1944, the Battle of Ancona during &quot;Operation Olive&quot; (the fighting on the Gothic Line in September 1944), and the Battle of Bologna during the final offensive in Italy in March 1945.

In 1944, the Polish II Corps numbered about 50,000 soldiers. During three subsequent battles, it suffered heavy losses (in the final stage of the Battle of Monte Cassino, even the support units were mobilised and used in combat) and it was suggested to General Anders that he withdraw his units. However, since the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with the Polish government and no Poles were allowed out of the USSR, Anders believed that the only source of recruits lay ahead – in German POW camps and concentration camps. During the fighting in Italy in June 1944, the II corps was considered to be the most determined formation in the entire British 8th Army as the British historian H.P. Willmott wrote: &quot;in the Allied camp the Poles were probably unequalled in their willingness and determination to get to close quarters with the enemy&quot;. On 12 June 1944, the Polish 3rd Carpathian Division had replaced the 4th Indian Division along the Penne-Atri-Pineto line. The II corps was assigned to lead the Allied advance along the Adriatic Sea and by 20 June 1944 the Poles had reached Fermo and were closing in on Ancona. After advancing 60 miles over a four day period, the II corps was halted by a German counterattack which drove the Poles back to the Chienti river. 

By 1945, new units were added, composed mainly of freed POWs and Poles forcibly conscripted into the Wehrmacht. This increased the Corps&#x27; strength to around 75,000 men, approximately 20,000 of whom were transferred to other Polish units fighting in the West. After the war, the divisions of the Corps were used in Italy until 1946, when they were transported to Britain and demobilised. The total establishment of the Polish II Corps in 1946 was 103,000.

The majority of soldiers remained in exile and settled in Britain, although some elected to settle in other countries such as Canada or Australia, either obtaining immigration visas there or relying on previous ties for repatriation.

The Corps had a consistently high fighting reputation and was well-regarded by the American and Commonwealth troops with whom they fought.

Those that settled in Britain were transported from many ports, including Toulon, France.

==Composition==
In May 1945, the Corps consisted of 55,780 men, one bear and approximately 1,500 women in auxiliary services. Their bear mascot, named Wojtek, was officially entered onto the unit roll as a private soldier, subsequently being promoted to corporal. The majority of the Corps were Polish citizens who had been deported by the NKVD to the Soviet Gulags during the Soviet Union&#x27;s annexation of Eastern Poland (Kresy Wschodnie) in 1939. Following Operation Barbarossa and the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, many of them were released and allowed to join the Polish Armed Forces in the East being formed in Southern Russia and Kazakhstan. For political reasons, the Soviet Union soon withdrew support for the creation of a Polish Army on its territory and reduced the supply rate, which resulted in General Władysław Anders withdrawing his troops to British-held Persia and Iraq. From there, they were moved to British-controlled Palestine, where they joined forces with the 3rd Carpathian Division, which was composed mainly of Polish soldiers who had managed to escape to French Lebanon through Romania and Hungary after the defeat of Poland in 1939.

The main bulk of the soldiers were from the eastern voivodeships of pre-war Poland. Although the majority were ethnic Poles, there were also other nationalities, including Jews, Belarusians and Ukrainians. After being relocated to Palestine, many Jewish soldiers deserted and fled into the countryside. However, Menachem Begin – the future Prime Minister of Israel and at the time a II Corps soldier – though urged by his friends to desert, refused to remove his uniform until he had been officially discharged.


The armament was as follows:
* 248 pieces of artillery
* 288 anti-tank guns
* 234 anti-aircraft guns
* 264 tanks
* 1,241 APCs
* 440 armoured cars
* 12,064 cars, Bren carriers and trucks
* 1 Syrian brown bear Wojtek (soldier bear)

==Losses==
During the Italian Campaign, the Polish II Corps lost 11,379 men. Among them were 2,301 killed in action, 8,543 wounded in action and 535 missing in action.

Of the 2,301 killed, 1,079 died during the Battle of Monte Cassino and are interred at the Monte Cassino Polish war cemetery, several hundred meters from the rebuilt abbey.

<doc id="433802" wikidata="Q1148985" url="?curid=433802" title="C. R. Smith">
<text>Cyrus Rowlett &quot;C.R.&quot; Smith (September 9, 1899 – April 4, 1990) was the CEO of American Airlines from 1934 to 1968 and from 1973 to 1974. He was also the wartime deputy commander of the Air Transport Command during World War II, and the United States Secretary of Commerce for a brief period under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He is regarded as one of the titans of U.S. airline history.

==Early life==
Smith was born on September 9, 1899, in Minerva, Texas, located in Milam County, to Roy Edgerton Smith and the former Marion Burck. Smith attended the University of Texas despite never having graduated from high school.

Upon his graduation, Smith worked as an accountant for the accounting firm of Peat Marwick Mitchell. Smith later ran a number of businesses, including a Western apparel store and a firm that sold state records of new mothers to manufacturers of baby supplies.

==Airline career==
Smith&#x27;s abilities were first recognized by Texas industrialist Alva Pearl Barrett, who in 1928 set up the airline Texas Air Transport (TAT), which became Southern Air Transport. Smith joined SAT as a vice president in 1929, and through a series of mergers SAT became part of American Airlines. American&#x27;s owner, E. L. Cord, hired Smith to run the nationwide network based on his able management of the Southern operation. In 1934, he became president of American Airlines.

In business, he was known for an informal, no-nonsense leadership style that stressed close relationships with both executives and employees. Convair president Jack Naish noted that &quot;you can close a $100 million deal on his word alone.&quot; He generally communicated through personally typed one-page memos. Smith was said to know every American employee by name until the end of his first term as CEO. He fostered a close relationship with Douglas Aircraft that led American to become a key adopter of the Douglas DC-3 and DC-6: he was also one of the early proponents of what is now LaGuardia Airport in New York City.

One of Smith&#x27;s most famous acts was the publication of an advertisement entitled &quot;Why Dodge This Question: Afraid To Fly?&quot; in 1934. Airline safety had been a taboo subject at the time, and Smith was credited with being the first airline manager to discuss it openly with the public.

In 1946, Smith began to break Pan American&#x27;s monopoly in international air travel through American Overseas Airlines, leading to American&#x27;s expansion overseas. He also created the Admirals Club, the first member&#x27;s only airline lounge system. In the 1950s, he helped American become the first domestic jet carrier in the US by selecting the Boeing 707 aircraft, which came out months before its rival Douglas DC-8.

Smith was instrumental in lobbying for the FAA to implement a mandatory retirement age of 60 for commercial airline pilots in large part because he was eager to remove older, more expensive pilots from his cockpits and replace them with younger pilots with lower salaries. Smith was convinced it would be easier to train younger pilots for the new jet airliners, as there was some anecdotal evidence suggesting that older pilots on average took longer to adjust to the new jet airliners which had very different control characteristics than airliners with propellers. The age 60 retirement rule was publicly justified on the grounds that pilots might experience health issues past the age of 60. This rule remained in effect from 1960 until 2007 when Congress voted to raise it to 65 on the grounds that the age 60 rule was outdated and it was now much easier to screen pilots for potential health risks.

In 1953, Smith was having dinner with a CBS radio executive who complained of the lack of advertisers willing to have their commercials aired in the middle of the night, even at reduced rates. Smith struck a deal and bought the block of hours from 11:30 pm until 6:00 am exclusively for American and created the show &quot;Music &#x27;Til Dawn&quot;. It was played on nine major CBS radio stations in American&#x27;s network with classical, semi-classical, and easy listening music with only subtle advertising. &quot;Music &#x27;Til Dawn&quot; lasted for 15 years and became an award winning radio show with millions of followers.

Smith left American in 1968 to become the US Secretary of Commerce. He agreed to return to American in 1973 for six months, following a period of corporate mismanagement and scandal, while the board of directors searched for a permanent replacement. After the six month period was over, Smith retired for a final time stating that he was &quot;thinking with a DC-6 mind and this business has changed. Yet if you don&#x27;t take my advice, I&#x27;ll get upset.&quot;

==Military career==

With the outbreak of World War II, Smith was one of two US airline presidents to leave their company and join the military (Bob Six of Continental Airlines was the other). Smith become a colonel in the United States Army Air Forces, eventually rising to the rank of major general in the Air Transport Command. Due to his informal but results-oriented management style, Smith won high praise during the war. Referring to Smith and ATC commander General Harold George, Chief of the Air Force General Hap Arnold wrote that, &quot;no matter what mission I gave them, I could count on its being carried out 100%&quot;. After the war, Smith returned to run American Airlines.

==Political career==
Smith was exceptionally well-connected politically, beginning with a Fort Worth and Texas base. He was close friends with many prominent Texan politicians, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Jesse Jones and Sam Rayburn. Smith was also on very close terms with the Roosevelt family, especially Eleanor Roosevelt and her son Elliott Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt would habitually call on Smith for travel arrangements. Smith introduced Elliott to his second wife, served as best man, and persuaded him to move to Fort Worth.

Smith&#x27;s friendship with Lyndon Johnson was the principal reason for his accession to the Cabinet, and he became the U.S. Secretary of Commerce following the resignation of Alexander B. Trowbridge. Smith served until the age of 69, from March 6, 1968 until January 19, 1969. However, he often clashed with the civil service because of his aversion to bureaucracy: on his first day, he objected to having four secretaries and asked that three of them be fired. This culture shock caused him to leave his post after only serving for 11 months and enter his first retirement, before being called back to American in 1973.

==Personal life==
Smith married Elizabeth L. Manget, in Dallas, Texas, on December 29, 1934. Manget explained their short lived marriage with, &quot;I loved the man, but I can&#x27;t be married to an airline.&quot; They had one son, Douglas Smith. Smith never married again. After retiring, Smith moved from his New York City apartment to a Washington DC townhouse. At the age of 85, he moved to Annapolis, Maryland, to be closer to his son and grandkids.

Smith&#x27;s passion when not working was trout fishing, and was known for giving expensive fishing poles as gifts to friends and associates throughout his career. When speaking of retirement to a colleague, Smith said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t fish, there&#x27;s nothing else to do.&quot; Smith co-owned a ranch in Ennis, Montana, where he trout fished and raised cattle. Smith was a Baptist.

===Art collection===
While living in New York City, Smith felt homesick for his native Texas and started collecting fine Western art. Smith donated 100 Western art paintings to his alma mater, University of Texas, which are on display at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas. This collection includes art from Henry Farny, Maynard Dixon, and others. Smith donated a western oil painting &quot;The Romance Makers&quot; by Charles Russell to the University of Notre Dame and it is on the collection of the Raclin Murphy Museum of Art. A book was written about Smith&#x27;s art collection and donations in 1988, titled &quot;Collecting the West: The C.R. Smith Collection of Western American Art&quot;.

Smith also had a vast nautical art collection, which he donated to Admirals Clubs throughout American&#x27;s route system.

<doc id="433804" wikidata="Q937846" url="?curid=433804" title="Henri Cazalis">
<text>Henri Cazalis (; 9 March 1840, Cormeilles-en-Parisis, Val-d&#x27;Oise – 1 July 1909, Geneva) was a French physician who was a symbolist poet and man of letters and wrote under the pseudonyms of Jean Caselli and Jean Lahor.

His works include:
*&quot;Chants populaires de l&#x27;Italie&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Vita tristis. Rêveries fantasques. Romances sans musique dans le mode mineur&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Melancholia&quot; (1868)
*&quot;Le Livre du néant&quot; (1872)
*&quot;Henry Regnault, sa vie et son œuvre&quot; (1872)
*&quot;L&#x27;Illusion&quot; (1875-1893)
*&quot;Cantique des cantiques&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Les Quatrains d&#x27;Al-Gazali&quot; (1896)
*&quot;William Morris&quot; (1897).

The author of the &quot;Livre du néant&quot; had a predilection for gloomy subjects and especially for pictures of death. His oriental habits of thought earned for him the title of the &quot;Hindou du Parnasse contemporain&quot; (cf. &quot;Le Parnasse contemporain&quot;).

Some of his poems have been set to music by Camille Saint-Saëns, Henri Duparc, Charles Bordes, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn, Edouard Trémisot, Dagmar de Corval Rybner, and Paul Paray.

He also maintained a correspondence of interest with the poet Stéphane Mallarmé from 1862 to 1871.

See a notice by Paul Bourget in &quot;Anthologie des poétes fr. du XIXieme siècle&quot; (1887-1888); Jules Lemaître, &quot;Les Contemporains&quot; (1889); Émile Faguet in the &quot;Revue bleue&quot; (October 1893). George Santayana&#x27;s &quot;Poetry and Religion&quot; (1900) has an essay on his concept of &quot;La gloire du néant&quot;.

==Danse Macabre==

Saint-Saëns&#x27; Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) is based on this poem written by Henri Cazalis.

 Zig, zig, zig, Death in cadence, 
 Striking with his heel a tomb, 
 Death at midnight plays a dance-tune, 
 Zig, zig, zig, on his violin. 
 The winter wind blows and the night is dark; 
 Moans are heard in the linden-trees. 
 Through the gloom, white skeletons pass, 
 Running and leaping in their shrouds. 
 Zig, zig, zig, each one is frisking. 
 The bones of the dancers are heard to crack- 
 But hist! of a sudden they quit the round, 
 They push forward, they fly; the cock has crowed.

<doc id="433809" wikidata="Q841241" url="?curid=433809" title="Limeira">
<text>Limeira is a city in the eastern part of the Brazilian state of São Paulo. With a population of approximately 291,869 people (2022 IBGE.) and covering an area of 581 square kilometers, it sits at an elevation of 588 meters. The city is situated 154 kilometers from São Paulo, the capital of the state, and 1011 kilometers from Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. Limeira is conveniently accessible from São Paulo via two highways: Rodovia Anhanguera and Rodovia dos Bandeirantes.

In the past, Limeira was a significant center for coffee cultivation and played a strategic role in the industry. It also earned the nickname &quot;Brazilian orange capital&quot; due to its extensive production of citrus fruits. However, the primary agricultural focus in the city has now shifted to sugar cane cultivation. Limeira has gained international recognition as &quot;Brazil&#x27;s plated jewelry capital&quot; due to its thriving industry in plated and semi-jewelry. More than 450 companies in Limeira are responsible for half of Brazil&#x27;s exports in this sector.

Limeira is part of the São Paulo metropolitan complex, which is the largest in the southern hemisphere, with an estimated population of around 30 million people.

==History==

The history of Limeira dates back to the economic exploitation of the state of São Paulo, specifically in the mid-1820s, marking the foundation of the Limeira region. The city&#x27;s name is steeped in legend, offering an intriguing explanation for its origins.

According to local folklore, pioneers would often seek respite at a guesthouse situated approximately 150 km from São Paulo, near the Tatuibi River. In the Tupi-Guarani language, &quot;Tatuibi&quot; translates to &quot;small armadillo.&quot; This resting place became known as Rancho Morro Azul (Blue Hill Ranch) due to its proximity to a striking blue-hued hill that could be seen from a distance.

According to the legend, in 1781, a caravan traveling to the wilderness of Araraquara made a stop in Limeira and set up camp near a stream called Córrego do Bexiga, which is now the location of the Market Model. Among the members of the caravan was a Franciscan friar named João das Mercês, who carried a variety of lime orange known as &quot;picuá de limas,&quot; believed to possess healing properties for fevers. However, the friar fell ill later that night and attributed his sickness to the limas, suspecting that they had been poisoned. He died during the night, and the following day, he was buried at the same site along with his untouched Picuá de Lima limes that no one dared to consume due to the perceived risk of poisoning. Legend has it that a lime tree sprouted from the seeds of those limes. Over the years, the place originally known as Rancho do Morro Azul (Blue Hill Ranch) came to be called Rancho de Limeira (the Ranch of the Lime Orange Tree).

=== Historical Background ===
The founding of Limeira took place on cleared land situated along the path known as the &quot;Picadão de Cuiabá&quot;, an important historical route that played a crucial role in trade and the provision of resources to mines in Mato Grosso.

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, landowners and farmers from &quot;Cidade da Constituição&quot; (Piracicaba), Itu, Porto Feliz, and Atibaia identified the region as having fertile land for agriculture. They acquired allotments from the provincial government between 1799 and 1820.

The village of Limeira began to develop with the installation of mills and the arrival of slaveholders and slaves. Squatters who had settled in the area were subsequently expelled. According to the 1822 census, the population of the Town of Piracicaba, including the regions of Morro Azul and Tatuibi (both part of Limeira), consisted of 951 free people and 546 slaves.

The road infrastructure connecting Limeira to the capital was inadequate, prompting Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro to lead a group of farmers, including Manuel Bento de Barros and José Ferraz de Campos, in requesting the construction of a new road. Their aim was to facilitate the transportation of goods from the mills in the region of Piracicaba and Limeira.

Upon the completion of the new road in 1826 and the subsequent formalization of the settlement project known as the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora das Dores do Tatuibi in 1830, the municipality of Limeira took shape. The bustling trade and flourishing development along this road were instrumental in laying the foundations of the city.

In 1842, Limeira was elevated to the status of a village. Two years later, in 1844, the city council was established with Manuel José de Carvalho serving as its first president. In 1842, the village of Limeira was elevated to the status of a town and eventually achieved city status on April 18, 1863. The city&#x27;s official anniversary is celebrated on September 15, and it is considered to have been founded in 1826.

Limeira holds historical significance as one of the earliest cities in Brazil to embrace privately sponsored European immigration. In 1840, Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro, owner of Ibicaba Mill, introduced a partnership system by bringing eighty Portuguese individuals to work on his lands. This initiative aimed to replace slave labor with free European workers who would receive certain benefits. German immigrants also joined the workforce at Ibicaba in 1846, further contributing to the transition away from slave labor.

The Ibicaba farm, which became one of Brazil&#x27;s largest coffee producers during its peak, entered the realm of literary art. In her historical novel, Swiss writer Eveline Hasler accompanies Swiss settlers on their journey and colonization in Ibicaba. In 1996, the property embarked on tourism activities and has since welcomed a considerable number of domestic and international visitors. However, the majority of its revenue is derived from sugarcane farming, as its lands are leased to Usina Iracema.

Today, the Ibicaba farm is renowned for its historical significance and architectural features. It encompasses structures such as the main house, slave quarters, terraces, and dams, which contribute to the city&#x27;s collection of historic farms.

==Geography==
Limeira is located at an elevation of 588 meters in the Campinas Administrative Region, 145 km northwest of São Paulo city. It serves as the administrative hub for the Limeira Microregion, which encompasses eight municipalities: Araras, Leme, Limeira, Pirassununga, Cordeirópolis, Conchal, Santa Cruz da Conceição, and Iracemápolis. The city benefits from its strategic positioning along major road and rail networks, connecting São Paulo state to Minas Gerais and the Midwest region of Brazil. It is also well-connected to a prominent railway line that facilitates the transportation of goods from the Amazon region to the port of Santos. Limeira is situated near the Tietê-Paraná Waterway, a significant water route that links it to the southern states of Brazil and the Mercosur countries. The city is positioned in a region characterized by a peripheral depression, with elevations ranging from 500 to 800 meters. Morro Azul is a notable landmark in the Limeira region, standing at an elevation of 831 meters above sea level, making it the highest point in the area. This prominent feature has served as a reliable reference point for pioneers and travelers, guiding them through the vast territories of the region.

=== Climate ===
Limeira experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa), with distinctive wet and dry seasons lasting from October to March and from April to September, respectively, and warm to hot temperatures year-round. The average temperature is 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) and yearly precipitation stands at 1300.5 mm (51.2 in). On 17 October 2014, temperatures in the city reached a record high of 38.6 °C (101.4 °F) and its coldest day was 9 July 2011, with a low of 0.1 °C (32.1 °F).

==Economy==
===Industry===

Limeira&#x27;s industrial legacy dates back to 1850 when it first ventured into the manufacturing of agricultural equipment. During the Paraguayan War, Limeira played a pivotal role by producing instruments for soldiers. Between 1907 and 1922, Limeira witnessed the emergence of significant industries, including Chapéus Prada (1907), Café Kühl (1920), and Indústria de Papel Santa Cruz (1922). However, it was after the 1940s that Limeira gained recognition for its industrial sector.
Between the 1940s and 1970s, Limeira witnessed the rise of several citrus companies engaged in orange cultivation and orange juice production. These companies catered to both domestic and international markets, including the United States and Europe, contributing to Limeira&#x27;s reputation as &quot;The City of Orange&quot;. Among the prominent players were Citrobrasil (1940) and Citrosuco (1966), which dominated the orange production sector in Limeira. However, the orange industry in Limeira faced a significant setback when the United States implemented protective measures to support its own orange industry in California. This led to a decline in orange production in Limeira. Additionally, the automotive sector gained prominence in Limeira after World War II, with the establishment of companies like &#x27;Freios Varga&#x27; (now TRW) in 1945 and &#x27;Rodas Fumagalli&#x27; in 1946.

In the aftermath of the 1970s, Limeira&#x27;s industrial sector experienced a rapid expansion, attracting the interest of multinational corporations. Among the notable companies that established their presence in the city are Ajinomoto. In 1974, the American corporation Rockwell acquired Fumagalli, and in 2000, &#x27;Freios Varga&#x27; became a part of the English-based Lucas Group. In more recent years, Limeira has become a preferred destination for Japanese and Korean automotive companies, including Yacchyio do Brasil, Stanley, Mando, DAS, and Faurecia. Furthermore, the city has witnessed the construction of a new plant by the French company Faurecia. In 2011, Samsung made a substantial investment of $300 million to establish its manufacturing facility in Limeira.

Limeira is renowned for its thriving plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry, attracting customers from all over the world and earning the city the title of &quot;Brazil&#x27;s capital of plated jewelry.&quot;

To make the city more appealing to industries, The local government has implemented various incentive programs aimed at reducing unemployment and informal labor, which have been on the rise along with the city&#x27;s population. A significant portion of the population commutes to nearby cities such as Piracicaba and Americana for work. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Limeira had a GDP of R$12.155 billion (approximately U$3.81 billion) in 2017, with the industrial sector accounting for roughly 50% of registered jobs in the city. Limeira&#x27;s industrial park has been developed and implemented guided by its incentive program, emphasizing its industrial vocation.

Limeira benefits from several advantageous factors for its development, including the expansion of the Bandeirantes Highway (Rodovia dos Bandeirantes), the establishment of the Tietê-Paraná waterway, and the installation of the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline.

=== Commercial and Service Industries ===
The commerce and service sector in Limeira is vibrant and diverse. The city is home to over 4,000 retail stores and 3,000 service businesses. The introduction of a shopping complex along the Anhanguera Road in the 1980s greatly stimulated the expansion of Limeira&#x27;s service industry. In line with the global trends of globalization and outsourcing, a multitude of companies have emerged in Limeira, offering support to the city&#x27;s industrial sector through modernization efforts.

Although the original mall closed in the 1990s, there is still a shopping mall located in the downtown area known as Shopping Patio Limeira.

In terms of public services, Limeira is home to several regional organizations and government agencies, as well as private institutions like CIESP, SENAI, SESI, and SENAC.

One of the main challenges faced by the city is competition from neighboring cities, which offer a wider variety and more convenient shopping options. In some cases, residents may prefer to travel to Campinas or Piracicaba for their consumer needs.

Limeira is renowned as the leading citrus producer in São Paulo and is particularly known for its production of citrus seedlings.

Limeira has also developed into a prominent center for plant and seedling commerce, particularly in the Geada area along the Limeira-Piracicaba Road (located at kilometer 120). Notable companies in this sector include Félix Plantas, Bonin Plantas, Dierberger, and Chácara Roseira.

==Media==

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Oliver Reginald Kaizana Tambo (27 October 191724 April 1993) was a South African anti-apartheid politician and activist who served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1967 to 1991.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Oliver Tambo was born on 27 October 1917 in the village of Nkantolo in Bizana; eastern Pondoland in what is now the Eastern Cape. Most of the people in the village were farmers. His father, Mzimeni Tambo, was the son of a farmer and an assistant salesperson at a local trading store. Mzimeni had four wives and ten children, all of whom were literate. Oliver&#x27;s mother, Mzimeni&#x27;s third wife, was called Julia.

===Education===
Tambo graduated high school in 1938 as one of the top students. After this, Tambo was admitted to the University of Fort Hare but in 1940 he, along with several others including Nelson Mandela, was expelled for participating in a student strike. In 1942, Tambo returned to his former high school in Johannesburg to teach science and mathematics.

===Youth League===
In 1944, along with Nelson Mandela, and Walter Sisulu, Tambo founded the ANC Youth League, with Tambo becoming its first National Secretary and a member of the National Executive in 1948. The Youth League proposed a change in the tactics of the anti-apartheid movement. Previously, the ANC had sought to further its cause by actions such as petitions and demonstrations; the Youth League felt these actions were insufficient to achieve the group&#x27;s goals and proposed their own &quot;Program of Action&quot;. This program advocated tactics such as boycotts, civil disobedience, strikes, and non-collaboration.
In 1955, Tambo became Secretary-general of the ANC after Sisulu was banned by the South African government under the Suppression of Communism Act. In 1958, he became Deputy President of the ANC and in 1959 was served with a five-year banning order by the government.

===Exile to London===
In response, Tambo was sent abroad by the ANC to mobilize opposition to apartheid on 21 March 1960. He settled with his family in Muswell Hill, north London, where he lived until 1990. His exile took a toll on him not seeing his wife and three children, but his wife Adelaide supported the ANC at home by taking in ANC members arriving from the UK.

In 1967, Tambo became Acting President of the ANC, following the death of Chief Albert Luthuli. He sought to keep the ANC together even after he was exiled from South Africa. Due to his skillful lobbying, he was able to attract talented South African exiles, one of them being Thabo Mbeki.

On 30 December 1979 in Lusaka, Zambia, Tambo as president and Alfred Nzo, then secretary-general of the ANC, met Tim Jenkin, Stephen Lee and Alex Moumbaris, ANC members and escapees from incarceration at Phillip Kgosi Prison as political prisoners. Their presence was officially announced by the ANC in early January and Tambo introduced them at a press conference on 2 January 1980.

===Guerrilla activity===
Tambo was directly responsible for organizing active guerrilla units. Along with his comrades, among whom were Nelson Mandela, Joe Slovo, and Walter Sisulu, Tambo directed and facilitated several attacks against the South African public. In an interview in 1985, Tambo was quoted as saying: &quot;In the past, we were saying the ANC will not deliberately take innocent life, but now, looking at what is happening in South Africa, it is difficult to say civilians are not going to die.&quot;

The post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) identified Tambo as the person who gave final approval, in between 1978 and 1979, for the 20 May 1983 Church Street bombing, which resulted in the death of 19 people and injuries to 197–217 people. The attack was orchestrated by a special operations unit of the ANC&#x27;s Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), commanded by Aboobaker Ismail. Such units had been authorized by Tambo as President of the ANC in 1979. At the time of the attack, they reported to Joe Slovo as chief of staff.

The ANC&#x27;s submission said that the bombing was in response to a South African cross-border raid into Lesotho in December 1982 which killed 42 ANC supporters and civilians, and the assassination of Ruth First, an ANC activist and wife of Joe Slovo, in Maputo, Mozambique. It claimed that 11 of the casualties were SADF personnel and hence a military target. The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as they were administrative staff, including telephonists and typists, they could not be considered a legitimate military target.

Ten MK operatives, including Ismail, applied for amnesty for this and other bombings. The applications were opposed on various grounds, including that it was a terrorist attack disproportionate to the political motive. The TRC found that the number of civilians versus military personnel killed was unclear. South African Police statistics indicated that seven members of the SADF were killed. The commission found that at least 84 of the injured were SADF members or employees. Amnesty was granted by the TRC.

In 1985, he was re-elected President of the ANC. In October of that year, Tambo gave an important interview to the editor of the &quot;Cape Times&quot; newspaper, Tony Heard, in which he outlined the ANC&#x27;s position and vision for a future, non-racial, South Africa. The interview was important for helping to create the political conditions for the South African government to later openly enter talks with the ANC thereby resulting in the CODESA negotiations that would start upon his return to South Africa.

===Return to South Africa===
He returned to South Africa on 13 December 1990 after over 30 years in exile. He was able to return to South Africa because of the legalization of the ANC. When he returned after his time in exile he received much support. Some of that support even came from old rivals. However, because of his stroke in 1989, it was harder for him to fulfill his duties as President of the ANC, so in 1991, at the ANC&#x27;s 48th National Conference, Nelson Mandela took over as president of the ANC. When he stepped down as president, however, the congress created a special position for him as the National Chairman.

===Death===
After suffering complications following a stroke, Tambo died on 24 April 1993, at the age of 75. His death came 14 days after Chris Hani&#x27;s assassination and one year before the 1994 general election in which Nelson Mandela became President. Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and other prominent politicians attended the funeral. Tambo was buried in Benoni, Gauteng.

==Personal life==

Tambo was a devout Anglican.

==International relationships==

The strong fight against apartheid brought Tambo to form a series of intense international relationships.
In 1977, Tambo signed the first solidarity agreement between the ANC and a municipality: the Italian town of Reggio Emilia was the first city in the world to sign such a pact of solidarity. This was the beginning of a long understanding which brought Italy to put an effort into concrete actions to support the right of southern African people&#x27;s self-determination; one of these actions was the organization of solidarity ships. The first one, called &quot;Amanda&quot;, departed from Genova in 1980.
It was Tambo himself who asked Reggio Emilia to mint Isitwalandwe Medals, the greatest of the ANC&#x27;s honors.

==Honours==
In 2004, he was voted number 31 in SABC3&#x27;s &quot;Great South Africans&quot;, scoring lower than H. F. Verwoerd, before the SABC decided to cancel the final rounds of voting. The decision to cancel the results was largely informed by the fact that the majority of blacks South Africans did not participate in the voting, as SABC3 caters predominantly to English speakers.

In late 2005, ANC politicians announced plans to rename Johannesburg International Airport after him. Then-President Thabo Mbeki at this time did not side with this idea, and there was a behind closed door meeting deliberating on this. Votes were in favour of the idea and against Mbeki and the proposal was accepted and the renaming ceremony occurred on 27 October 2006. The ANC-dominated government had previously renamed Jan Smuts Airport as Johannesburg International Airport in 1994 on the grounds that South African airports should not be named after political figures.

There is a sculpture of Tambo at the Albert Road Recreation Ground, Muswell Hill, close to his London home. In February 2021, Haringey Council renamed the park as the O.R. Tambo Recreation Ground. In June 2013, the city of Reggio Emilia in Italy celebrated Tambo with the creation of a park dedicated to the President of the African National Congress.

His house at 51 Alexandra Park Road, Muswell Hill, London, was purchased by the South African Government in 2010 as a historic monument and now bears a plaque.

Tambo&#x27;s grave was declared a National Heritage site when he died but lost this status when his wife, Adelaide Tambo, died and was buried alongside him. However their grave was re-declared a National Heritage site in October 2012.

The ANC safe house in Lusaka, Zambia where Tambo spent much of his time in exile when not in London was declared a national monument by the Zambian Government in 2017, and opened to the public as Oliver Tambo Heritage House. It was opened by South African President Jacob Zuma, Zambian President Edgar Lungu and former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda. 

To conclude the centenary celebrations of the birth of Tambo, a commemoration was held at Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Moroka, Soweto on 27 October 2017. This same event marked also the centenary of the sinking of the troopship SS &quot;Mendi&quot;. The event was curated by Ambassador Lindiwe Mabuza and Fr Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu, together with the Thabo Mbeki Foundation and the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation.

<text>Die Hard 2 (also known by its tagline Die Harder or Die Hard 2: Die Harder) is a 1990 American action thriller film directed by Renny Harlin, written by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson, co-produced by Joel Silver, and starring Bruce Willis as John McClane alongside Bonnie Bedelia, William Sadler, Art Evans, William Atherton, Franco Nero, Dennis Franz, Fred Thompson, John Amos, and Reginald VelJohnson. The second installment in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; film series, the film was released on July 4, 1990, in the United States.

As with the first film, the action in &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; takes place on Christmas Eve. McClane is waiting for his wife to land at Washington Dulles International Airport when terrorists take over the air traffic control system. He must stop the terrorists before his wife&#x27;s plane and several other incoming flights that are circling the airport run out of fuel and crash. During the night, McClane must also contend with airport police and a military commander, none of whom want his assistance.

The film was released to generally positive reviews with critics praising the film&#x27;s action and tone while criticizing elements of the plot. &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; was a major box-office success, grossing $240 million and doubling the earnings of its predecessor and finishing as the year&#x27;s seventh-highest-grossing film. The film was preceded by &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) and followed by &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; (1995), &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; (2007), and &quot;A Good Day to Die Hard&quot; (2013).

==Plot==

On Christmas Eve, two years after the events of the previous film, John McClane is now a lieutenant with the LAPD, who arrives at Dulles International Airport to pick up his wife, Holly. Meanwhile, a plane carrying corrupt foreign military leader General Ramon Esperanza is also headed to Dulles under extradition for using U.S. funds to buy drugs.

Waiting to meet Esperanza&#x27;s plane is disgraced former Colonel William Stuart and a group of ex-military sympathizers who supported Esperanza&#x27;s actions. McClane follows two of Stuart&#x27;s men into a restricted baggage sorting area where a gun fight ensues. He kills one man, but the other escapes. With the help of his friend Sergeant Al Powell, he discovers that the dead man&#x27;s fingerprints correspond to an American soldier who was listed as having died in a helicopter accident two years earlier. McClane reports his concerns to the ill-tempered airport police chief, Carmine Lorenzo, and air traffic control director Ed Trudeau, but neither believes him.

Stuart and his men, operating out of a church on the outskirts of the airport, cut all communications with incoming airplanes, disable all runway lighting, and demand that Esperanza&#x27;s plane be allowed to land without interference. Under Stuart&#x27;s direction, Trudeau orders all air traffic controllers to have all planes in Dulles airspace hold in the air despite their low fuel warnings.

McClane becomes worried about Holly&#x27;s plane and enlists the help of the airport janitor Marvin to fight back. Chief airport engineer Leslie Barnes decides to try using an unfinished antenna array to communicate with the stranded circling airplanes. Lorenzo sends an airport SWAT team with him, but Stuart&#x27;s men kill the officers and destroy the antenna. McClane saves Barnes and kills Stuart&#x27;s men in turn. In retaliation, Stuart crashes a British airliner, killing everyone on board, by impersonating air traffic control and faking the airplane&#x27;s altimeter reading by recalibrating sea level.

Esperanza&#x27;s plane lands and McClane wounds Esperanza before Stuart and his men arrive. They blow up the plane and take Esperanza to the church, but McClane survives. A Blue Light team arrives, led by Major Grant, of whom Stuart is a protégé. Grant&#x27;s men and McClane attack the church. McClane kills one of Stuart&#x27;s men and gives chase with his gun, but the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles. McClane follows but his vehicle is destroyed by gunfire. Confused as to how he failed to wound anyone, McClane realizes the gun was filled with blanks, meaning the earlier firefight was staged and Grant&#x27;s team are secretly in cahoots with Stuart.

Grant, Stuart, their men, and Esperanza all rendezvous at an airport hangar, where a Boeing 747 that they demanded is waiting for them. On Holly&#x27;s flight, arrogant reporter Richard Thornburg becomes suspicious as to why the plane has not landed. He taps into the cockpit communications and records a transmission from Barnes to all the circling airplanes describing the situation. From the airplane&#x27;s lavatory, Richard broadcasts the recording live on television, leading to a panic in the airport terminal which prevents McClane and Lorenzo from getting to the 747. Holly subdues Thornburg with a fellow passenger&#x27;s taser.

McClane asks a news crew to fly him via helicopter to intercept the 747. McClane jumps onto the wing and uses his coat to jam the aileron, preventing the plane from taking off. During a fistfight, McClane kicks Grant into a jet engine. While fighting Stuart, McClane opens a fuel valve in the engine pylon just as Stuart kicks him off the wing. McClane uses a cigarette lighter to ignite the fuel trail, causing the plane to blow up and killing everyone on board. The fire trail also serves as a landing guide for all airborne aircraft, including Holly&#x27;s, to land safely.

After McClane and Holly are reunited, Marvin picks them up in his airport cart and drives them away.

==Cast==
Additional cast members include Colonel Stuart&#x27;s hitmen: Don Harvey as Garber, John Costelloe as Sergeant Oswald Cochrane, Vondie Curtis-Hall as Miller, John Leguizamo as Burke, Robert Patrick as O&#x27;Reilly, Tom Verica as Kahn, Tony Ganios as Baker, Michael Cunningham as Sheldon, Peter Nelson as Thompson, Ken Baldwin as Mulkey, and Mark Boone Junior as Shockley. Patrick O&#x27;Neal appears as Telford, Major Grant&#x27;s radio operator.

==Production==

The screenplay was adapted from Walter Wager&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;58 Minutes&quot;. The novel has the same plot but differs slightly: a police officer must stop terrorists who take an airport hostage while his daughter&#x27;s plane circles overhead, and has 58 minutes to do so before the plane crashes. Roderick Thorp, who wrote the 1979 novel &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;, upon which &quot;Die Hard&quot; was based, receives credit for creating &quot;certain original characters&quot;, although his name is misspelled onscreen as &quot;Roderick Thorpe&quot;.

One of the writers of the screenplay, Steven E. de Souza, later admitted in an interview for the book &quot;Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie&quot; that the villains were based on America&#x27;s &quot;Central American&quot; meddling, primarily the Iran–Contra affair.

The film was originally budgeted at $40 million. Bruce Willis was paid $7.5 million for reprising his role for the film. Producer Joel Silver was accused of profligate spending and it was claimed the film cost $60–70 million. Fox domestic distribution president Tom Sherak dismissed the $70 million claim as &quot;absurd&quot;. It was reported at the end of filming that Silver had been relieved of day-to-day producing duties.

Scenes of Dulles airport in the snow were to be filmed in Denver but filming was scrapped due to warm weather. Some outdoor scenes were filmed in Alpena, Michigan, while others needing to accommodate the landing of the 747 with snow were filmed at former Kincheloe Air Force Base in Kincheloe, Michigan. Other scenes were filmed on a soundstage in Los Angeles using fake snow.

&quot;Die Hard 2&quot; was the first film to use digitally composited live-action footage with a traditional matte painting that had been photographed and scanned into a computer. It was used for the last scene, which took place on a runway.

According to Franco Nero, Silver got the idea to cast him after he saw movie posters of Nero hanging in the office of their mutual accountant. Nero did not want to do &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; because he did not like the script and he had committed to do the film &quot;Breath of Life&quot;. Finally, Silver scheduled Nero&#x27;s scenes in such a way that the actor could do both films.

==Release==
===Marketing===
In a trailer for the film screened during Christmas 1989, the film had a planned release date of June 29, 1990. This was brought forward to June 22; however, following claims of the film running over time and budget, the release date was pushed back two weeks to July 4.

===Home media===
The film debuted on video in the United States on January 31, 1991, and it was the most rented video in its first week above &quot;Navy SEALs&quot; and sold a record 505,000 units for rental.

The film became available on DVD on March 9, 1999, followed by a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD on July 10, 2001, as part of the Die Hard Ultimate Collection DVD and re-released again in early 2005 as a Widescreen Edition and June 19, 2007, followed by a Blu-ray release on November 20, 2007, and a re-release on January 29, 2013.

===Video game===
Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a side-scrolling first-person rail gallery shooter released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS in 1992, published by Grandslam Video and developed by Tiertex. The game uses the movie&#x27;s plot, in which John shoots terrorists invading Washington&#x27;s Dulles Airport in areas such as the luggage center and a runway, chasing after enemies on a snowmobile, and finally on the wing of the terrorists&#x27; plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, each with a boss, John must fight. Occasionally, he must also avoid killing civilians crossing each level. Some enemies, when killed, drop power-ups such as med-kits, armor, grenades and weapons that are collected by shooting them. A game over occurs when John has exhausted all of his lives and continues; the game then resets to the main menu.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Die Hard 2&quot; exceeded all expectations by outdoing the box-office success of &quot;Die Hard&quot;. The film had the largest pre-opening, earning $3.7 million from 1,828 theaters. For six years, it would hold this record until it was surpassed by &quot;Independence Day&quot; in 1996. It had a wide release in 2,507 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $21.7 million its opening weekend. &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; went on to gross $117.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $122.5 million internationally, earning over $240 million worldwide, almost doubling that of &quot;Die Hard&quot;. The film was re-released internationally in 1993 and made $216,339 more, which totaled its gross to $240.2 million. During a period of time, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;, starring &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; star Bruce Willis&#x27; then wife Demi Moore, would occupy the number one and number two spots at the box office, a feat would not be accomplished again for a married Hollywood couple until 2024.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; has an approval rating of 69% based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;It lacks the fresh thrills of its predecessor, but &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; still works as an over-the-top – and reasonably taut – big-budget sequel, with plenty of set pieces to paper over the plot deficiencies.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, who gave the original film a mixed review, described the sequel as &quot;terrific entertainment&quot;, despite noting substantial credibility problems with the plot. Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; dubbed the film as being as disappointing a sequel as &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, and said, Whatever small pleasure there is to be found in this loud dud is due mostly to the residual good feelings from the first film... As played by Bruce Willis, McClane is still an engaging character, even if he is much less amusingly drawn this time. Willis is in there trying, but the qualities that helped to make his character sympathetic in the first film are missing. McClane no longer worries openly about his personal safety, as he did in the original movie. His quasi-cowboy personality from &quot;Die Hard&quot; is all but forgotten – he has become more of a Rambo and less of a Roy Rogers. And though the filmmakers try to establish McClane as resistant to advanced technology, this promising idea isn&#x27;t developed.&quot;Empire&quot; magazine rated the film three out of five stars, while stating, &quot;It&#x27;s entertaining nonsense that doesn&#x27;t quite manage to recapture the magic of the original. Still, there are some nice moments here, and Willis is on solid ground as the iconic McClane.&quot;

Gene Siskel ranked the film as the sixth best movie of 1990. &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine ranked the film&#x27;s plane crash #2 on its list of &quot;Greatest Movie Plane Crashes&quot;.

<doc id="433825" wikidata="Q128979" url="?curid=433825" title="General Electric GE90">
<text>The General Electric GE90 is a family of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines built by GE Aerospace for the Boeing 777, with thrust ratings from . It entered service with British Airways in November 1995. It is one of three engines for the 777-200 and -200ER, and the exclusive engine of the -200LR, -300ER, and 777F. It was the largest jet engine, until being surpassed in January 2020 by its successor, the GE9X, which has a larger fan diameter by . However, the GE90-115B, the most recent variant of the GE90, is rated for a higher thrust (115,000 lbs) than the GE9X.

==Background==
In the early 1980s, GE began to develop an unducted fan (UDF) engine, which was thought to be a more fuel-efficient option to propel short-haul airliners, a compelling proposition after the 1979 oil crisis. NASA gave GE a grant in February 1984 to continue its research, eventually building the experimental GE36. One of the major innovations for the engine were its carbon fiber composite fan blades, which were both lighter and stronger than traditional materials. However, the UDF was less reliable than the turbofans of the era, lower fuel costs made the cost of developing the engine less attractive, and the company was worried the GE36 would cannibalize sales of the highly successful CFM56 engine it had co-developed with Snecma of France.

== Development ==
The GE90 engine was launched in 1990 to provide a large turbofan engine for the Boeing 777, a wide-body, long-range, twin-engine jet airliner. GE Aviation teamed with Snecma (France, 24%), IHI (Japan) and Avio (Italy) for the program. The GE90 would face stiff competition as Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce would also offer engines for the 777, the PW4000 and Trent 800, respectively.

The major innovation of the GE90 was that it used 22 carbon fiber composite fan blades, technology first developed for the GE36. These blades provided double the strength at one-third the weight of traditional titanium fan blades. The 22 fan blades were a significant reduction from the 38 blades used in GE&#x27;s prior large turbofan, the CF6, despite the greater diameter of the GE90. Having fewer fan blades reduces the engine weight and improves aerodynamic efficiency.

With the stiff competition to equip the first generation 777 models (777-200 and 777-200ER), GE tried to branch out and use the GE90 for other aircraft. Then-CEO Brian H. Rowe went so far as to offer to pay for the development of the GE90 for the Airbus A330, but Airbus rebuffed the plan, instead choosing to focus on the four-engine A340 for the long-haul market.

In the late 1990s, Boeing began developing the second-generation 777 long-range variants (777-200LR, 777-300ER, and 777F). For these aircraft a more powerful engine in the thrust class of was required, leading to talks between Boeing and engine manufacturers. General Electric offered to develop the GE90-115B engine, while Rolls-Royce proposed developing the Trent 8104 engine. In 1999, Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric, beating out rival proposals. Under the deal with General Electric, Boeing agreed to only offer GE90 engines on new 777 versions. The GE90-115B had its first run at the GE facility in Peebles, Ohio in November 2001.

==Design==
The GE90&#x27;s 10-stage high-pressure compressor developed a then-industry record pressure ratio of 23:1 and is driven by a 2-stage, air-cooled, HP turbine. A 3-stage low-pressure compressor, situated directly behind the fan, supercharges the core. The fan/LPC is driven by a 6-stage low-pressure turbine.

The higher-thrust variants, GE90-110B1 and -115B, have a different architecture from that of the earlier GE90 versions. General Electric incorporated an advanced larger diameter fan made from composite materials which enhanced thrust at low flight speeds. However, GE also needed to increase core power to improve net thrust at high flight speeds. Consequently, GE elected to increase core capacity, which they achieved by removing one stage from the rear of the HP compressor and adding an additional stage to the LP compressor, which more than compensated for the reduction in HP compressor pressure ratio, resulting in a net increase in core mass flow 
. The higher-thrust GE90 variants are the first production engines to feature swept rotor blades. The nacelle has a maximum diameter of . Each of the 22 fan blades on the GE90-115B have a length of and a mass of less than .

==Operational history==
As one of the three available engines for the all-new Boeing 777 large twinjet airliner, the GE90 was an all-new $2 billion design in contrast to the offerings from Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce which were modifications of existing engines.

The first General Electric-powered Boeing 777 was delivered to British Airways on November 12, 1995. The aircraft, with two GE90-77Bs, entered service five days later. Initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear concerns, which caused the airline to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997. British Airways&#x27; aircraft returned to full service later that year.

Problems with GE90 development and testing caused delays in Federal Aviation Administration certification. British Airways soon replaced the GE90 with the Rolls-Royce Trent 800 on their 777s. In addition the GE90&#x27;s increased thrust was not yet required by airlines and it was also the heaviest engine of the three available choices, making it the least popular option on these first generation 777s (777-200 and 777-200ER, also known collective as the 777 Classics) while the Rolls-Royce engine was the most popular. 

For Boeing&#x27;s second-generation 777 long-range versions (777-200LR, 777-300ER, and 777F), greater thrust was needed to meet the aircraft requirements. General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney insisted on a winner-take-all contract due to the $500 million investment in engine modifications needed to meet the requirements, with GE receiving sole engine supplier status. The improved version entered service with Air France in May 2004.

The higher thrust GE90-110B1 and -115B engines, in combination with the second-generation 777 variants -200LR and -300ER, were primary reasons for 777 sales being greater than those of the rival A330/340 series. Using two engines produces a typical operating cost advantage of around 8–9% for the -300ER over the A340-600. The 777-300ER was also seen as a 747-400 replacement amid rising fuel prices given its 20% fuel burn advantage.

Until passed by its derivative, the GE9X, the GE90 series held the title of the largest engines in aviation history. The fan diameter of the original series being , and the largest variant GE90-115B has a fan diameter of . As a result, the GE90 engine can only be air-freighted using an outsize cargo aircraft such as the Antonov An-124, which restricts shipping options if, due to an emergency diversion, a 777 were stranded needing an engine change. If the fan and fan case are removed the engine may be shipped using a 747 Freighter.

The -94B for the -200ER was retrofitted with some of the first FAA-approved 3D-printed components.

In 2011, its list price was US$27.5 million, and it had an in-flight shutdown rate (IFSD) of one per million engine flight-hours. Until November 2015, it accumulated more than 8 million cycles and 50 million flight hours in 20 years. 
In July 2020, the fleet of 2,800 engines surpassed 100 million hours, powering over 1,200 aircraft for 70 operators with a dispatch reliability rate of 99.97%.
A complete overhaul costs more than $12 million.

===Records===
The GE90-115B provided enough thrust to fly N747GE, GE&#x27;s Boeing 747-100 flying testbed with the other three engines at idle, an attribute demonstrated during a flight test.
According to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, at , the engine held the record for the highest thrust achieved by an aircraft engine (the maximum thrust for the engine in service is its rated thrust ). This thrust record was reached inadvertently as part of a one-hour, triple-red-line engine stress test using a GE90-115B development engine at GE&#x27;s outdoor test complex near Peebles, Ohio. It eclipsed the engine&#x27;s previous Guinness world record of .
On November 10, 2017, its successor, the GE9X, reached a higher record thrust of in Peebles.

The initial GE90 fan shaft design loads were greatly increased for operational torque and the fan blade-off condition. To accommodate the increase in fan-shaft torsional and bending stresses, a steel alloy, GE1014, not previously used in aircraft engines was required. A significantly longer fan shaft spline-coupling was required and maintaining the required high machining accuracy was challenging.
In October 2003, a Boeing 777-300ER broke the ETOPS record by being able to fly five and a half hours (330 minutes) with one engine shut down. The aircraft, with GE90-115B engines, flew from Seattle to Taiwan as part of the ETOPS certification program.
On November 10, 2005, the GE90 entered the Guinness World Records for a second time. The GE90-110B1 powered a 777-200LR during the world&#x27;s longest flight by a commercial airliner, though there were no fare-paying passengers on the flight, only journalists and invited guests. The 777-200LR flew in 22 hours, 22 minutes, flying from Hong Kong to London &quot;the long way&quot;: over the Pacific, over the continental U.S., then over the Atlantic to London.

==Incidents==

On August 11, 2004, a GE90-85B powering a Boeing 777-200ER on British Airways flight 2024 suffered an engine failure on takeoff from George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston. The pilots noticed a noise and vibration on takeoff but continued the rotation. At 1500 ft AGL they noticed smoke and haze in the cockpit and cabin crew advised cabin was filling with smoke. They returned to the airport for an immediate emergency landing.
Findings were a stage 2 turbine blade had separated at its shank damaging the trailing blades causing the vibration. The debris was contained in the engine casing.
On May 28, 2012, an Air Canada 777-300ER taking off from Toronto en route to Tokyo suffered failure of a GE90-115B at and returned safely. Engine debris was found on the ground.
On September 8, 2015, a GE90-85B powering a Boeing 777-236ER on British Airways Flight 2276 suffered an uncontained failure during take-off roll at Las Vegas McCarran Airport, leading to a fire. NTSB and FAA investigations were begun to determine the cause; initial findings were reported in September 2015.
On June 27, 2016, a GE90-115B powering a Boeing 777-300ER, on Singapore Airlines Flight 368, received an engine oil warning during flight and returned to Singapore Changi Airport. On landing the malfunctioning right engine caught fire, leading to fire damage to the engine and the wing.

===Transfer gearbox failures===
The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) on May 16, 2013, and sent it to owners and operators of General Electric GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B turbofan engines. This emergency AD was prompted by reports of two failures of transfer gearbox assemblies (TGBs) which resulted in in-flight shutdowns (IFSDs). Investigation revealed that the failures were caused by TGB radial gear cracking and separation. This through the combined effect of manufacturing process and operating stresses. Further inspections found two additional radial gears with cracks. This condition, if not corrected, could result in additional IFSDs of one or more engines, loss of thrust control, and damage to the airplane. The Airworthiness Directive requires compliance by taking remedial measures within five days of receipt of the AD. All affected modules have been replaced.

==Specifications==

==Derivatives==

===GEnx===
The GEnx engine, that has been developed for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 747-8, is derived from a smaller core variant of the GE90, also featuring a fan with swept rotor blades.

===GP7000===
GE Aviation set up a cooperative venture with Pratt &amp; Whitney, named Engine Alliance, under which the companies have developed an engine for the Airbus A380, named GP7000, based on an 0.72 flow scale of the GE90-110B/115B core.

===GE9X===
In February 2012, GE announced studies on a 10% more efficient derivative, dubbed the GE9X, to power the new Boeing 777-8X/9X aircraft.

===LM9000===

The LM9000 is an aeroderivative gas turbine available in two options; the LM9000 without water augmentation outputting at a 42.4% efficiency before cogeneration, and the LM9000 with water augmentation outputting at a 42.7% efficiency before cogeneration. The engine&#x27;s 33:1 pressure ratio comes from a 4-stage low pressure compressor followed by a 9 stage high pressure compressor, driven by a 2 stage high pressure turbine and a 1-stage low pressure turbine, powering a 4-stage free turbine.

<doc id="433827" wikidata="Q1280859" url="?curid=433827" title="Pepper's ghost">
<text>Pepper&#x27;s ghost is an illusion technique, used in the theatre, cinema, amusement parks, museums, television, and concerts, in which an image of an object off-stage is projected so that it appears to be in front of the audience.

The technique is named after the English scientist John Henry Pepper, who popularised the effect during an 1862 Christmas Eve theatrical production of the Charles Dickens novella, &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot;, which caused a sensation among those in attendance at the Regent Street theatre in London. An instant success, the production was moved to a larger theatre and continued to be performed throughout the whole of 1863, with the Prince of Wales (future King Edward VII) bringing his new bride (later Queen Alexandra) to see the illusion, and launched an international vogue for ghost-themed plays which used this novel stage effect during the 1860s and subsequent decades.

The illusion is widely used for entertainment and publicity purposes. These include the Girl-to-Gorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows and the appearance of &quot;ghosts&quot; at the Haunted Mansion and the &quot;Blue Fairy&quot; in Pinocchio&#x27;s Daring Journey, both at Disneyland in California. Teleprompters are a modern implementation of Pepper&#x27;s ghost. The technique was used to display a life-size illusion of Kate Moss at the 2006 runway show for the Alexander McQueen collection &quot;The Widows of Culloden.&quot;

In the 2010s, the technique has been used to make virtual artists appear onstage in apparent &quot;live&quot; concerts, with examples including Elvis Presley, Tupac Shakur, and Michael Jackson. It is often wrongly described as &quot;holographic&quot;. Such setups can involve custom projection media server software and specialized stretched films. The installation may be a site-specific one-off, or a use of a commercial system such as the Cheoptics360 or Musion Eyeliner.

Products have been designed using a clear plastic pyramid and a smartphone screen to generate the illusion of a 3D object.

== Effect ==

The core illusion involves a stage specially arranged into two rooms or areas, one into which audience members can see, and a second (sometimes referred to as the &quot;blue room&quot;) that is hidden to the side. A plate of glass (or Plexiglas or plastic film) is placed somewhere in the main room at an angle that reflects the view of the blue room towards the audience. Generally, this is arranged with the blue room to one side of the stage, and the plate on the stage rotated around its vertical axis at 45 degrees. Care must be taken to make the glass as invisible as possible, normally hiding the lower edge in patterning on the floor and ensuring lights do not reflect off it. The plate catches a reflection from a brightly lit actor in an area hidden from the audience. Not noticing the glass screen, the audience mistakenly perceive this reflection as a ghostly figure located among the actors on the main stage. The lighting of the actor in the hidden area can be gradually brightened or dimmed to make the ghost image fade in and out of visibility.

When the lights are bright in the main room and dark in the blue room, the reflected image cannot be seen. When the lighting in the blue room is increased, often with the main room lights dimming to make the effect more pronounced, the reflection becomes visible and the objects within the blue/hidden room seem to appear, from thin air, in the space visible to the audience. A common variation uses two blue/hidden rooms, one behind the glass in the main room, and one to the side, the contents of which can be switched between &quot;visible&quot; and &quot;invisible&quot; states by manipulating the lighting therein.

The hidden room may be an identical mirror-image of the main room, so that its reflected image exactly matches the layout of the main room; this approach is useful in making objects seem to appear or disappear. This illusion can also be used to make an object, or person—reflected in, say, a mirror—appear to morph into another (or vice versa). This is the principle behind the Girl-to-Gorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows. Another variation: the hidden room may itself be painted black, with only light-coloured objects in it. In this case, when light is cast on the room, only the light objects strongly reflect that light, and therefore appear as ghostly, translucent images on the (invisible) pane of glass in the room visible to the audience. This can be used to make objects appear to float in space.

The type of theatre use of the illusion which John Henry Pepper pioneered and repeatedly staged in the 1860s were short plays featuring a ghostly apparition which interacts with other actors. An early favourite showed an actor attempting to use a sword against an ethereal ghost, as in the illustration. To choreograph other actors&#x27; dealings with the ghost, Pepper used concealed markings on the stage floor for where they should place their feet, since they could not see the ghost image&#x27;s apparent location. Pepper&#x27;s 1890 book includes such detailed explanation of his stagecraft secrets, disclosed in his 1863 joint application with co-inventor Henry Dircks to patent this ghost illusion technique.

The hidden area is typically below the visible stage but in other Pepper&#x27;s Ghost set-ups it can be above or, quite commonly, adjacent to the area visible to the viewers. The scale can be very much smaller, for instance small peepshows, even hand-held toys. The illustration shows Pepper&#x27;s initial arrangement for making a ghost image visible anywhere throughout a theatre.

Many effects can be produced via Pepper&#x27;s Ghost. Since glass screens are less reflective than mirrors, they do not reflect matte black objects in the area hidden from the audience. Thus Pepper&#x27;s Ghost showmen sometimes used an invisible black-clad actor in the hidden area to manipulate brightly lit, light-coloured objects, which can thus appear to float in air. Pepper&#x27;s very first public ghost show used a seated skeleton in a white shroud which was being manipulated by an unseen actor in black velvet robes. Hidden actors, whose heads were powdered white for reflection but whose clothes were matte black, could appear as disembodied heads when strongly lit and reflected by the angled glass screen.

Pepper&#x27;s Ghost can be adapted to make performers apparently materialise from nowhere or disappear into empty space. Pepper would sometimes greet an audience by suddenly materialising in the middle of the stage. The illusion can also apparently transform one object or person into another. For instance, Pepper sometimes suspended on stage a basket of oranges which then &quot;transformed&quot; into jars of marmalade.

Another 19th century Pepper&#x27;s Ghost entertainment featured a figure flying around a theatre backcloth painted as the sky. The hidden actor, lying under bright lights on a rotating, matte black table, wore a costume with metallic spangles to maximise reflection on the hidden glass screen. This foreshadows some 20th century cinema special effects.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===
Giambattista della Porta was a 16th-century Neapolitan scientist and scholar who is credited with a number of scientific innovations. His 1589 work &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot; (&quot;Natural Magic&quot;) includes a description of an illusion, titled &quot;How we may see in a Chamber things that are not&quot; that is the first known description of the Pepper&#x27;s ghost effect.

Porta&#x27;s description, from the 1658 English language translation (page 370), is as follows.

From the mid-19th century, the illusion, today known as Pepper&#x27;s Ghost, became widely developed for money-making stage entertainments, amid bitter argument, patent disputes, and legal action concerning the technique&#x27;s authorship. A popular genre of entertainment was stage demonstrations of scientific novelties. Simulations of ghostly phenomena through innovative optical technology fitted these well. Phantasmagoria shows, which simulated supernatural effects, were also familiar public entertainments. Previously, these had made much use of complex magic lantern techniques, like the multiple projectors, mobile projectors, and projection on mirrors and smoke, which had been perfected by Étienne-Gaspard Robert/Robertson in Paris early in the century. The new illusion, soon to be labeled Pepper&#x27;s Ghost, offered a completely different and more convincing way to produce ghost effects, using reflections not projection.

A claim to be the first user of the new illusion in theatres came from the Dutch-born stage magician Henrik Joseph Donckel, who became famous in France under the stage name Henri Robin. Robin said he had spent two years developing the illusion before trying it in 1847 during his regular shows of stage magic and the supernatural in Lyons. However, he found this early rendering of the ghost effect made little impression on the audience. He wrote: &quot;The ghosts failed to achieve the full illusory effect which I have subsequently perfected.&quot; The shortcomings of his original techniques &quot;caused me great embarrassment, I found myself forced to put them aside for a while.&quot;

While Robin later became famous for many effective, imaginative, and complex applications of &quot;Pepper&#x27;s Ghost&quot; at Robin&#x27;s own theatre in Paris, such shows only began mid-1863 after John Henry Pepper had demonstrated his own method for staging the illusion at the London Polytechnic in December 1862. Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin, contemporary French grand master of stage magic, regarded Robin&#x27;s performances and other 1863 ghost shows in Paris as &quot;plagiarists&quot; of Pepper&#x27;s innovation. Jim Steinmeyer, a modern technical and historical authority on Pepper&#x27;s Ghost, has expressed doubts as to the reliability of Robin&#x27;s claims for his 1847 performances. Whatever Robin did in 1847, by his own account it produced nothing like the stage effect whereby Pepper, and later Robin himself, astonished and thrilled audiences during 1863.

In October 1852 Pierre Séguin, an artist, patented in France a portable peepshow-like toy for children, which he named the &quot;polyoscope&quot;. This used the very same illusion, based on reflection, which ten years later Pepper and Dircks would patent in Britain under their own names. Although creating illusory images within a small box is appreciably different from delivering an illusion on stage, Séguin&#x27;s 1852 patent was eventually to lead to the defeat of Pepper&#x27;s 1863 attempt to control and license the &quot;Pepper&#x27;s Ghost&quot; technique in France as well as in Britain.

Pepper described Séguin&#x27;s polyoscope:
&quot;It consisted of a box with a small sheet of glass, placed at an angle of forty-five degrees, and it reflected a concealed table, with plastic figures, the spectre of which appeared behind the glass, and which young people who possessed the toy invited their companions to take out of the box, when it melted away, as it were, in their hands and disappeared.&quot;
In 1863, Henri Robin maintained that Séguin&#x27;s polyoscope had been inspired by his own original version of the stage illusion, which Séguin had witnessed while painting magic lantern slides for another part of Robin&#x27;s show.

=== Dircks and Pepper ===
Henry Dircks was an English engineer and practical inventor who from 1858 strove to find theatres which would implement his vision of a sensational new genre of drama featuring apparitions which interacted with actors on stage. He constructed a peepshow-like model which demonstrated how reflections on a glass screen could produce convincing illusions. He also outlined a series of plays featuring ghost effects, which his apparatus could enable, and worked out how complex illusions, like image transformations, could be achieved through the technique. But in terms of applying the effect in theatres, Dircks seemed unable to think beyond remodelling theatres to resemble his peepshow model. He produced a design for theatres which required costly, impractical rebuilding of an auditorium to host the illusion. The theatres, which he approached, were not interested. In another bid to attract interest, he advertised his models for sale and in late 1862 the models&#x27; manufacturer invited John Henry Pepper to view one.

John Henry Pepper was a scientific all-rounder who was both an effective public educator in science and an astute, publicity-conscious, commercial showman. In 1854, he became the director and sole lessee of the Royal Polytechnic where he held the title of Professor. The Polytechnic ran a mix of science education courses and eye-catching public displays of scientific innovations.

After seeing Dircks&#x27; peepshow model in 1862, Pepper quickly devised an ingenious twist whereby, through adding an angled sheet of glass and a screened-off orchestra pit, almost any theatre or hall could make the illusion visible to a large audience. First public performance in December 1862—a scene from Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Man—&quot;produced rapturous responses from audience and journalists. A deal was struck between Pepper and Dircks whereby they jointly patented the illusion. Dircks agreed to waive any share of profits for the satisfaction of seeing his idea implemented so effectively. Their joint patent was obtained provisionally in February 1863 and ratified in October 1863.

Before Dircks&#x27; partnership with Pepper was a full year old, Dircks published a book which accused Pepper of plotting to systematically stamp Pepper&#x27;s name alone on their joint creation. According to Dircks, while Pepper took care to credit Dircks in any communications to the scientific community, everything which reached the general public—like newspaper reports, advertisements and theatre posters—mentioned Pepper alone. Whenever Dircks complained, he said, Pepper would blame careless journalists or theatre managers. However, the omission had occurred so repeatedly that Dircks believed that Pepper was deliberately striving to fix his name alone in the minds of the general public. A good half of Dircks&#x27; 106-page book, &quot;The Ghost&quot;, comprises such recriminations with detailed examples of how Pepper hid Dircks&#x27; name.

An earlier 1863 &quot;Spectator&quot; article had presented the Dircks/Pepper partnership thus:
&quot;This admirable ghost is the offspring of two fathers…. To Mr. Dircks belongs the honour of having invented him…. and Professor Pepper has the merit of having improved him considerably, fitting him for the intercourse of mundane society, and even educating him for the stage.&quot;
=== Popularity ===
Short plays using the new ghost illusion swiftly became sensationally popular. Pepper staged many dramatic and profitable demonstrations, notably in the lecture theatre of London&#x27;s Royal Polytechnic. By late 1863, the illusion&#x27;s fame had spread extensively with ghost-centred plays performed at multiple London venues, Manchester, Glasgow, Paris, and New York. Royalty attended. There was even a shortage of plate glass because of demand from theatres for glass screens. A popular song from 1863 celebrated the &quot;Patent Ghost&quot;:

By his own account, Pepper, who was entitled to all profits, made considerable earnings from the patent. He ran his own performances and licensed other operators for money. In Britain, he was initially successful in suing some unlicensed imitators, deterring others by legal threats, and defeating a September 1863 court action by music-hall proprietors who challenged the patent. However, while in Paris in summer 1863 to assist a licensed performance, Pepper had proved unable to stop Henri Robin and several others who were already performing unlicensed versions there. Robin successfully cited Séguin&#x27;s pre-existing patent of the polyoscope, of which Pepper had been ignorant. During the next four years Robin developed spectacular and original applications of the illusion in Paris. One famous Robin show depicted the great violinist Paganini being troubled in his sleep by a demon violinist, who repeatedly appeared and disappeared.

During the next two decades, performances using the illusion spread to several countries. In 1877 a patent was registered for the United States. In Britain, theatre productions using Pepper&#x27;s Ghost toured far outside major cities. The performers travelled with their own glass screens and became known as &quot;spectral opera companies&quot;. Around a dozen such specialist theatre companies existed in Britain. A typical performance would comprise a substantial play where apparitions were central to the plot, like an adaption of Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; followed by a short comic piece which also used ghost effects. One company, for instance, &quot;The Original Pepper&#x27;s Ghost and Spectral Opera Company&quot; had 11 ghost-themed plays in its repertoire. Another such company during a single year, 1877, performed at 30 different places in Britain, usually for a week but sometimes for as long as six weeks. By the 1890s, however, novelty had faded and the vogue for such theatre was in steep decline. Pepper&#x27;s Ghost remained in use however at sensational entertainments comparable to &quot;dark rides&quot; or &quot;ghost trains&quot; at modern funfairs and amusement parks: a detailed account survives of audience participation in two macabre entertainments, which both used Pepper&#x27;s Ghost, within a &quot;Tavern of the Dead&quot; show which visited Paris and New York in the 1890s.

Since the 1860s, &quot;Pepper&#x27;s Ghost&quot; has become a universal term for any illusion produced via a reflection on an unnoticed glass screen. It is routinely applied to all versions of the illusion, which are now quite common in 21st century displays, peepshows, and installations in museums and amusement parks. However, the specific optics in these modern displays often follow Séguin&#x27;s or Dircks&#x27; earlier designs rather than the modification for theatres which first brought Pepper&#x27;s name into enduring usage.

== Modern uses ==

===Systems===
Several proprietary systems produce modern Pepper&#x27;s ghost effects. The &quot;Musion Eyeliner&quot; uses thin metalized film placed across the front of the stage at an angle of 45 degrees towards the audience; recessed below the screen is a bright image supplied by an LED screen or powerful projector. When viewed from the audience&#x27;s perspective, the reflected images appear to be on the stage. The &quot;Cheoptics360&quot; displays revolving 3D animations or special video sequences inside a four-sided transparent pyramid. This system is often used for retail environments and exhibitions.

=== Amusement parks ===

The world&#x27;s largest implementation of this illusion can be found at The Haunted Mansion and Phantom Manor attractions at several Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. There, a -long scene features multiple Pepper&#x27;s ghost effects, brought together in one scene. Guests travel along an elevated mezzanine, looking through a -tall pane of glass into an empty ballroom. Animatronic ghosts move in hidden black rooms beneath and above the mezzanine. A more advanced variation of the Pepper&#x27;s Ghost effect is also used at The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

The walk-through attraction Turbidite Manor in Nashville, Tennessee, employs variations of the classic technique, enabling guests to see various spirits that also interact with the physical environment, viewable at a much closer proximity. The House at Haunted Hill, a Halloween attraction in Woodland Hills, California, employs a similar variation in its front window to display characters from its storyline.
An example that combines the Pepper&#x27;s ghost effect with a live actor and film projection can be seen in the &quot;Mystery Lodge&quot; exhibit at the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm theme park in Buena Park, California, and the &quot;Ghosts of the Library&quot; exhibit at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, as well as the depiction of Maori legends called &quot;A Millennium Ago&quot; at the Museum of Wellington City &amp; Sea in New Zealand.

The Hogwarts Express attraction at Universal Studios Florida uses the Pepper&#x27;s ghost effect, such that guests entering &quot;Platform &quot; seem to disappear into a brick wall when viewed from those further behind in the queue.

The Curse at Alton Manor, an attraction at the Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire, England, uses multiple Pepper&#x27;s ghost effects. These include the ride&#x27;s preshow, where characters are projected inside an empty doll&#x27;s house before disappearing as the room is bathed in ultraviolet light, and a scene where Emily Alton, the attraction&#x27;s central antagonist, appears in a corporeal form before vanishing, in a similar fashion to effects used at the Disney parks. The effect was also used in the ride&#x27;s previous iterations, The Haunted House and Duel: The Haunted House Strikes Back; where Emily Alton and her cat Snowy could be seen as small corporeal ghosts inside a doll&#x27;s house in the attraction&#x27;s queue, similar to the preshow in the current iteration of the attraction.

=== Museums ===
Museums increasingly use Pepper&#x27;s ghost exhibits to create attractions that appeal to visitors. In the mid-1970s James Gardener designed the Changing Office installation in the London Science Museum, consisting of a 1970s-style office that transforms into an 1870s-style office as the audience watches. It was designed and built by Will Wilson and Simon Beer of Integrated Circles. Another particularly intricate Pepper&#x27;s ghost display is the Eight Stage Ghost built for the British Telecom Showcase Exhibition in London in 1978. This display follows the history of electronics in a number of discrete transitions.

More modern examples of Pepper&#x27;s ghost effects can be found in various museums in the United Kingdom and Europe. Examples of these in the United Kingdom are the ghost of Annie McLeod at the New Lanark World Heritage Site, the ghost of John McEnroe at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum, which reopened in new premises in 2006, and one of Sir Alex Ferguson, which opened at the Manchester United Museum in 2007.

In October 2008 a life-sized Pepper&#x27;s ghost of Shane Warne was opened at the National Sports Museum in Melbourne, Australia. The effect was also used at the Dickens World attraction at Chatham Maritime, Kent, United Kingdom. Both the York Dungeon and the Edinburgh Dungeon use the effect in the context of their &quot;Ghosts&quot; shows.

Another example can be found at the Our Planet Centre in Castries, St Lucia, which opened in May 2011, where a life-size Charles III and Governor-General of the island appear on stage talking about climate change.

German company Musion installed a holostage in the German Football Museum in Dortmund in 2016.

=== Television, film and video ===
The 1940 film &quot;Beyond Tomorrow&quot; uses the technique to show the three ghosts in the second half of the film.

Teleprompters are a modern implementation of Pepper&#x27;s ghost used by the television industry. They reflect a speech or script and are commonly used for live broadcasts such as news programmes.

A 1985 episode of &quot;Mr. Wizard&#x27;s World&quot; demonstrates Pepper&#x27;s ghost in one of its educational segments.

On 1 June 2013, ITV broadcast &quot;Les Dawson: An Audience With That Never Was&quot;. The program featured a Pepper&#x27;s ghost projection of Les Dawson, presenting content for a 1993 edition of &quot;An Audience with...&quot; to be hosted by Dawson but unused due to his death two weeks before recording.

In the 1990 movie &quot;Home Alone&quot;, the technique is used to show Harry with his head in flames, as the result of a blowtorch from a home invasion gone bad. CGI was not able to produce the desired results. The James Bond movie &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; features the girl-to-gorilla trick in one scene.

Early electro-mechanical arcade machines, such as Midway&#x27;s &quot;Stunt Pilot&quot; and Bally&#x27;s &quot;Road Runner,&quot; both made in 1971, use the effect to allow player-controlled moving vehicles to appear to share the same space as various obstacles within a diorama. Electrical contacts, connected to the control linkages, sense the position of the vehicle and obstacles, simulating collisions in the games&#x27; logic circuits without the models physically touching each other. Various arcade games, most notably Taito&#x27;s 1978 video game &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and SEGA&#x27;s 1991 video game &quot;Time Traveler&quot;, used a mirror-based variation of the illusion to make the game&#x27;s graphics appear against an illuminated backdrop.

=== Concerts ===

An illusion based on Pepper&#x27;s ghost involving projected images has been featured at music concerts (often erroneously marketed as &quot;holographic&quot;).

At the 2006 Grammy Awards, the Pepper&#x27;s ghost technique was used to project Madonna with the virtual members of the band Gorillaz onto the stage in a &quot;live&quot; performance. This type of system consists of a projector (usually DLP) or LED screen, with a resolution of 1280×1024 or higher and brightness of at least 5,000 lumens, a high-definition video player, a stretched film between the audience and the acting area, a 3D set/drawing that encloses three sides, plus lighting, audio, and show control.

During Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg&#x27;s performance at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, a projection of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur appeared and performed &quot;Hail Mary&quot; and &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;. The use of this approach was repeated in 2013 at west coast Rock the Bells dates, featuring projections of Eazy-E and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard.

On 18 May 2014, during the Billboard Music Awards, an illusion of deceased pop star Michael Jackson, other dancers, and the entire stage set was projected onto the stage for a performance of the song &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; from the posthumous &quot;Xscape&quot; album.

On 21 September 2017, the Frank Zappa estate announced plans to conduct a reunion tour with the Mothers of Invention that would make use of Pepper&#x27;s ghosts of Frank Zappa and the settings from his studio albums. Initially scheduled to run through 2018, the tour was later pushed back to 2019.

A projection of Ronnie James Dio performed at the Wacken Open Air festival in 2016.

=== Political speeches ===
NChant 3D telecast, live, a 55-minute speech by Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat, to 53 locations across Gujarat on 10 December 2012 during the assembly elections. In April 2014, they projected Narendra Modi again at 88 locations across India.

In 2014, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyep Erdogan delivered a speech via Pepper&#x27;s ghost in Izmir.

In 2017, French Presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon gave a speech using Pepper&#x27;s ghost at a campaign event in Aubervilliers.

<text>Colin Pickthall (born 13 September 1944) is a politician in the United Kingdom. He was Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for West Lancashire. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1992, and retired at the general election of 2005.

Pickthall&#x27;s father was a shipyard fitter. He attended Ulverston Grammar School, and then the University of Wales, obtaining a B.A. Hons. in English Literature and History. He then went on to the University of Lancaster, where he obtained an M.A. with the thesis &quot;The Influence of Socialism on 20th Century British Poetry&quot;. He became a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Labour Party, in 1963.

He married a Canadian, Judith Ann, in 1973; they have two daughters, Alisoun and Jenny. He initially worked as a lecturer of English at Ruffwood Comprehensive School and Edge Hill College of H.E. (where he became the Head of European Studies).

At the general election in June 1987, Pickthall ran for Parliament in West Lancashire, but lost to the Conservatives by 1,353 votes. Later, in 1989, he won the seat of Ormskirk on Lancashire County Council by a very small margin. However, this was sufficient for the Labour Party to take control of the County Council by one seat. 
At the April 1992 general election, he took the parliamentary seat of West Lancashire, and in the following elections, in May 1997 and June 2001, he retained the seat with a substantial majority. He became a member of the Select committee on Agriculture in 1992, the post that he maintained until 1997. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Alun Michael MP in 1997, later serving Jack Straw MP. 

He resigned as PPS in December 2000 in response to the police investigation into his election expenses. He was reinstated shortly afterwards, in 2001, when the police investigation concluded there had been “no wrongdoing”. He was transferred to the Foreign Office in 2001, where he continued as Straw&#x27;s PPS.

He pledged his &quot;continuing support&quot; for Tony Blair in July 2004, remarking that his performance has been &quot;psychologically remarkable&quot;.

Pickthall is considered a leftist, frequently campaigning on animal welfare and environmental issues. He is opposed to hare coursing, as the Waterloo Cup took place at Great Altcar, in his constituency, and hunting. His support for the hunting ban led to pro-hunt supporters leaving a dead fox on his doorstep in February 2005. He retired from the House of Commons at the general election of May 2005.

Pickthall is a supporter of Humanists UK.

<text>Peter Leslie Pike (26 June 1937 – 27 December 2021) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Burnley from June 1983 to April 2005.

== Life and career ==
Pike was born on 26 June 1937. He was evacuated to Burnley in his childhood during the Second World War and decided then that he wanted to be the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lancashire town. Returning to the town as an adult, he worked in the Mullards Factory, where he swiftly gained a reputation as an effective shop steward and was also an agent for the then MP for Burnley, Dan Jones.

He was an official frontbench spokesperson for Labour at the beginning of the 1990s on rural affairs and then on environment and housing. He was seen as an effective parliamentarian, and his committee work included chairing the committee in the House of Commons on Regulatory Reform from July 2001 to April 2005. He made three visits to South Africa from 1986 to 1990.

He announced his intention in October 2002 to retire as an MP at the next general election. Labour announced in December 2002 they were preparing to choose a woman as his successor. An all-women shortlist was created in January 2003 to determine his successor. His youngest daughter Jane was a firm favourite to succeed him, but she did not make the shortlist. Kitty Ussher was chosen as his successor in February 2004.

His role in the Anti-Apartheid Movement was praised in Parliament in December 2013 during tributes to Nelson Mandela.

He was re-elected as chair of Burnley Constituency Labour Party in June 2015. He stood down from this role in January 2016, citing his belief that the party needed a younger and more active chair. Upon his resignation, Pike had held positions within the Labour Party for almost sixty years. He had first arrived in Burnley in 1963. He was a strong supporter of Burnley Football Club and served as chair of the Clarets Trust.

He was also the driving force behind the establishment of the social enterprise Emmaus Burnley, for which he received a special medal in June 2021.

== Personal life ==
He married Shelia Bull in 1962; she died in November 2017 at the age of 83.

Pike died on 27 December 2021 at the age of 84. He was survived by his two daughters, Carol and Jane. Former Pendle MP Gordon Prentice paid tribute to him in his blog shortly afterwards.

<doc id="433843" wikidata="Q185453" url="?curid=433843" title="Multan">
<text>Multan (; ) is a city in Punjab, Pakistan, located on the bank of the river Chenab. It is amongst the five largest urban centres of Pakistan and is also the administrative centre of Multan Division. It is a major cultural, religious and economic centre of the Punjab region. Located in central Pakistan, with a district population of 5.3 million, it is the main hub of Southern Punjab.

Multan is one of the oldest cities in Asia with a history stretching deep into antiquity. Multan was part of the Achaemenid Empire of Iran in the early 6th century BC. The ancient city was besieged by Alexander the Great during the Mallian Campaign. Later it was conquered by the Umayyad military commander Muhammad bin Qasim in 712 CE after the conquest of Sindh. In 9th century it became a separate state, Emirate of Multan ruled by the Arab rulers. The region came under the rule of Ghaznavids and the Mamluk Sultanate in medieval period. In 1445, it became the capital of Langah Sultanate. Multan province was one of the significant provinces of the Mughal Empire. The Sikhs ruled over Multan from 1818 till 1848 when it was conquered by the British and made part of British Punjab. 

The city was among the most important trading centres of India and a great centre of knowledge and learning in the medieval Indian subcontinent during Turkish-Persian rule, and attracted a multitude of Sufi mystics in the 11th and 12th centuries, becoming a great centre of spirituality in South Asia and earning the city the sobriquet &quot;City of Saints.&quot; The city, along with the nearby city of Uch, is renowned for its large number of Sufi shrines dating from that era.

==Etymology==
The origin of Multan&#x27;s name is unclear. An ancient known name of the city was &quot;Malli-istan&quot;; &quot;Malli&quot; was the name of a tribe that inhabited the region and city.. Some have suggested the name derives from the Old Persian word &quot;mulastāna,&quot; &#x27;frontier land&#x27;, while others have ascribed its origin to the Sanskrit word &quot;mūlasthāna&quot;,

==History==

===Origin===
The region around Multan is home to several archaeological sites dating to the Early Harappan period of the Indus Valley civilization between 3000 BC until 2800 BC. According to the Hindu religious texts, Multan was founded by the sage Kashyapa. These texts also assert that Multan was the capital of the Trigarta Kingdom ruled by the Katoch dynasty during the Kurukshetra War that is central to the Hindu epic poem, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The city was visited by Greek admiral Skylax, who passed through the area in 515 BCE. The city was also mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus in 400 BC.
===Greek Invasion===

Multan is believed to have been the Malli capital that was conquered by Alexander the Great in 326 BCE as part of the Mallian Campaign. The Mallian people, together with nearby tribes, gathered an army of 90,000 personnel to fight against an army of 50,000 Greeks. This was perhaps the largest army faced by Greeks in the entire subcontinent. During the siege of the city&#x27;s citadel, Alexander reputedly leaped into the inner area of the citadel, where he faced the Mallian leader. Alexander was wounded by an arrow that had penetrated his lung, leaving him severely injured. After a fierce battle at the site of &#x27;Khooni Burj&#x27; the Mallian army eventually surrendered, preventing further bloodshed. During Alexander&#x27;s era, Multan was located on an island in the Ravi river, which has since shifted course numerous times throughout the centuries.

In the mid-5th century CE, the city was attacked by White Huns, a group of Barbarian Hephthalite nomads led by Toramana. After a fierce fight they conquered Multan, but did not stay long.

By the mid 7th century CE, Multan was conquered by Chach of Alor, of the Buddhist Rai dynasty. Chach appointed a thakur to govern from Multan, and used his army to settle boundary disputes with Kashmir.

===Islamic invasion===

Multan was first invaded by a Muslim army after the reign of the caliph Ali, in 664 CE, when Mohalib, an Arab general, occupied the city. The expedition, however, seems to have been directed towards exploration of the country as no attempt was apparently made to retain the conquest. After his conquest of Sindh, Muhammad ibn Qasim in 712 CE captured Multan from Raja Dahir following a two-month siege. Following ibn Qasim&#x27;s conquest, the city&#x27;s Subjects remained mostly non-Muslim for the next few decades under the Umayyad Caliphate.

===Emirate of Multan (9th and 10th century)===

In the 10th century, the Bhati Rajput rulers near Multan as well as the Muslim Emir of Multan were eager to assist Jayapala, the Hindu Shahi ruler of Afghanistan, because of the slave incursions into their territories by the rulers of Ghazni. However, Jayapala was unable to conquer Ghazni, and the alliance he had formed quickly fell apart.
====Abbasid &quot;Emirate&quot;====

By the mid-800s, the &quot;Banu Munabbih&quot; (855–959) also known as the &quot;Banu Sama&quot;, who claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s Quraysh tribe came to rule Multan, and established the Emirate of Banu Munabbih, which ruled for the next century.

During this era, the Multan Sun Temple was noted by the 10th century Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi to have been located in a most populous part of the city. The Hindu temple was noted to have accrued the Muslim rulers large tax revenues, by some accounts up to 30% of the state&#x27;s revenues. During this time, the city&#x27;s Arabic nickname was &quot;Faraj Bayt al-Dhahab&quot;, (&quot;Frontier House of Gold&quot;), reflecting the importance of the temple to the city&#x27;s economy.

The 10th century Arab historian Al-Masudi noted Multan as the city where Central Asian caravans from Islamic Khorasan would assemble. The 10th century Persian geographer Estakhri visited the area. At the time Mansura( the capital of Sindh) along with Multan were the only two major Arab principalities in South Asia. Arabic was spoken in both cities, though the inhabitants of Multan were reported by Estakhri to also have been speakers of Persian, reflecting the importance of trade with Khorasan. Polyglossia rendered Multani merchants culturally well-suited for trade with the Islamic world.

The 10th century &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot; notes that Multan&#x27;s rulers were also in control of Lahore, though that city was then lost to the Hindu Shahi. During the 10th century, Multan&#x27;s rulers resided at a camp outside of the city named &quot;Jandrawār&quot;, and would enter Multan once a week on the back of an elephant for Friday prayers.

====Ismaili &quot;Emirate&quot;====

Multan became capital of Emirate of Multan in 855. Al Masudi of Baghdad who visited Indus valley in 915 A.D mentioned in his book &quot;Meadows of Gold&quot; that it is one of the strongest frontier places of Muslims and in its neighbourhood there are a hundred and twenty thousand towns and villages&quot;.

By the mid 10th century, Multan had come under the influence of the Qarmatian Ismailis. The Qarmatians had been expelled from Egypt and Iraq following their defeat at the hands of the Abbasids there. Qarmatians zealots had famously sacked Mecca, and outraged the Muslim world with their theft and ransom of the Kaaba&#x27;s Black Stone, and desecration of the Zamzam Well with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE.

The governor of Jhang, Umar bin Hafas, was a clandestine supporter of the Fatimid movement and the Batiniya influence spread in Southern Punjab. Then, the Qarmatians who had established contacts with the Fatimids in Egypt set up an independent dynasty in Multan and ruled the surrounding areas.

They wrested control of the city from the pro-Abbasid Amirate of Banu Munabbih, and established the Emirate of Multan, while pledging allegiance to the Ismaili Fatimid Dynasty based in Cairo.
During this period, Uch and Multan remained a central pilgrimage site for Vaishnavite and Surya devotees, and their admixture with Isma’īlīsm created the Satpanth tradition. Hence, the beginning of the eleventh century witnessed a sacral and political diversity in Uch that was both unique and precarious. The Qarmatian Ismailis opposed Hindu pilgrims worshipping the sun, and destroyed the Sun Temple and smashed its revered &quot;Aditya&quot; idol in the late 10th century. The Qarmatians built an Ismaili congregational mosque above the ruins to replace the city&#x27;s Sunni congregational mosque that had been established by the city&#x27;s early rulers.

===11th-16th century CE===


====Ghaznavid dynasty====

Mahmud of Ghazni in 1005 led an expedition against Multan&#x27;s Qarmatian ruler Abul Fateh Daud. The city was surrendered, and Fateh Daud was permitted to retain control over the city with the condition that he adhere to Sunnism. In 1007, Mahmud led another expedition to Multan against his former minister and Hindu convert, Niwasa Khan, who had renounced Islam and attempted to establish control of the region in collusion with Abul Fateh Daud of Multan.

In 1010, Mahmud led his third and punitive expedition against Daud to depose and imprison him, and suppressed Ismailism in favour of the Sunni creed. He destroyed the Ismaili congregational mosque that had been built above the ruins of the Multan Sun Temple, and restored the city&#x27;s old Sunni congregational mosque, built by Muhammad bin Qasim.

The 11th century scholar Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi reported that the Ismaili community was still living in the city. Following the Ghaznavid invasion of Multan, the local Ismaili community split, with one faction aligning themselves with the Druze religion, which today survives in Lebanon, Syria, and the Golan Heights. Following Mahmud&#x27;s death in 1030, Multan regained its independence from the Ghaznavid empire and came under the sway of Ismaili rule once again. Shah Gardez, who came to Multan in 1088, is said to have contributed in the restoration of the city.

By the early 1100s, Multan was described by the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi as being a &quot;large city&quot; commanded by a citadel that was surrounded by a moat. In the early 12th century, Multani poet Abdul Rahman penned the &quot;Sandesh Rasak&quot;, the only known Muslim work in the medieval &quot;Apabhraṃśa&quot; language.

====Ghurid dynasty====

In 1175, Muhammad Ghori conquered Ismaili-ruled Multan, after having invaded the region via the Gomal Pass from Afghanistan into Punjab, and used the city as a springboard for his unsuccessful campaign into Gujarat in 1178. Multan was then annexed to the Ghurid Sultanate, and became an administrative province of the Mamluk Dynasty — the first dynasty based in Delhi. Multan&#x27;s Ismaili community rose up in an unsuccessful rebellion against the Ghaurids later in 1175.

====Mamluk dynasty====
Following the death of the first Mumluk Sultan, Qutb al-Din Aibak in 1210, Multan came under the rule of Nasiruddin Qabacha, who in 1222, successfully repulsed an attempted invasion by Sultan Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu of the Khwarazmian Empire, whose origins were rooted in Konye-Urgench in modern-day Turkmenistan. Uch and Sindh were also in control of Qabacha.

Qabacha also captured Lahore many times and ruled all these regions. He repulsed a 40-day siege imposed on Multan city by Mongol forces who attempted to conquer the city. He gathered a large army from Uch, Multan and Bukkhar (Sukkur) and Mongols were repulsed.

Following Qabacha&#x27;s death that same year, the Turkic king Iltutmish, the third Sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, captured and then annexed Multan in an expedition. The Punjabi poet Baba Farid was born in the village of Khatwal near Multan in the 1200s.

Qarlughids attempted to invade Multan in 1236, while the Mongols tried to capture the city in 1241 after capturing Lahore – though they were repulsed. The Mongols under Sali Noyan then successfully held the city to ransom in 1245–6, before being recaptured by Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban, the ninth Mamluk Sultan. Multan then fell to the Qarlughids in 1249, but was captured by Sher Khan that same year. Multan was then conquered by Izz al-Din Balban Kashlu Khan in 1254, before he rebelled against Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban in 1257 and fled to Iraq where he joined Mongol forces and captured Multan again, and dismantled its city walls. The Mongols again attempted an invasion in 1279, but were dealt a decisive defeat.

====Khaljis invasion====

Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji dispatched his brother Ulugh Khan in 1296 to conquer Multan region which was governed by surviving family members of his predecessor. (Sultan Jalal-ud-din Khalji)

After usurping the throne of Delhi, Alauddin decided to eliminate the surviving family members of Jalaluddin, who were present in Multan. In November 1296, he sent a 30,000–40,000 strong army led by Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan to Multan who successfully captured the city after two months of siege.

Amir Khusrau, the famous Indo-Persian Sufi singer, musician, poet and scholar visited Multan on the invitation of Khan Muhammad. Multan at the time was the gateway to India and was a center of knowledge and learning. Caravans of scholars, tradesmen and emissaries transited through Multan from Baghdad, Arabia and Persia on their way to Delhi. Khusrau wrote that:

I tied the belt of service on my waist and put on the cap of companionship for another five years. I imparted lustre to the water of Multan from the ocean of my wits and pleasantries.

====Tughluq dynasty====

In the 1320s Multan was conquered by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, he was made the governor of Multan and South Punjab, Sindh regions and of Depalpur. He was the founder of the Turkic Tughluq dynasty, the third dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Earlier he spent his time in Multan and fought 28 battles against Mongols from there and saved the regions from advances of Mongols. He wrote in the jamia Masjid of Multan that he had fought 28 battles against Mongols and had survived, people gave him the title Ghazi ul Mulk.

Ghiyath al din&#x27;s son Muhammad bin Tughlaq was born in Multan. After Ghiyath&#x27;s death he became the Sultan and ascended the throne in Delhi. The countryside around Multan was recorded to have been devastated by excessively high taxes imposed during the reign of Ghiyath&#x27;s son, Muhammad Tughluq. In 1328, the Governor of Multan, Kishlu Khan, rose in rebellion against Muhammad Tughluq, but was quickly defeated.

The Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam was completed during the Tughluq era, and is considered to be the first Tughluq monument. The shrine is believed to have been originally built to be the tomb of Ghiyath ad-Din, but was later donated to the descendants of Rukn-e-Alam after Ghiyath became Emperor of Delhi.

The renowned Arab explorer Ibn Battuta visited Multan in the 1300s during the reign of Muhammad Tughluq, and noted that Multan was a trading centre for horses imported from as far away as the Russian Steppe. Multan had also been noted to be a centre for slave-trade, though slavery was banned in the late 1300s by Muhammad Tughluq&#x27;s son, Firuz Shah Tughlaq.

====Timurid dynasty====

In 1397, Multan was besieged by Tamerlane&#x27;s grandson Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad&#x27;s forces captured the city in 1398 following the conclusion of the 6-month-long siege. Khizr Khan the governor of Multan allied with Amir Timur. Timur captured Lahore and gave its control to Khizr khan as reward for his support. Also in 1398, the elder Tamerlane and Multan&#x27;s Governor Khizr Khan together sacked Delhi. The sack of Delhi lead to major disruptions of the Sultanate&#x27;s central governing structure. Khizr Khan ruled the subcontinent on the name of Timur. In 1414, Multan&#x27;s Khizr Khan captured Delhi from Daulat Khan Lodi, and established the short-lived Sayyid dynasty — the fourth dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.

A contemporary writer Yahya Sirhindi mentions in his &quot;Takhrikh-i-Mubarak Shahi&quot; that Khizr Khan was a descendant of Muhammad.

====Langah Sultanate====

Multan then passed to the Langah, who established the Langah Sultanate in Multan under the rule of Budhan Khan, who assumed the title Mahmud Shah. The reign of Shah Husayn, grandson of Mahmud Shah, who ruled from 1469 to 1498 is considered to be most illustrious of the Langah Sultans. Multan experienced prosperity during this time, and a large number of Baloch settlers arrived in the city at the invitation of Shah Husayn. The Sultanate&#x27;s borders stretched encompassed the neighbouring regions surrounding the cities of Chiniot and Shorkot, including present day Faisalabad. Shah Husayn successfully repulsed attempted invasion by the Delhi Sultans led by Tatar Khan and Barbak Shah.

Multan&#x27;s Langah Sultanate came to an end in 1525 when the city was invaded by rulers of the Arghun dynasty, who were either ethnic Mongols, or of Turkic or Turco-Mongol extraction.

====Suri dynasty====

In 1541, the Pashtun king Sher Shah Suri captured Multan, and successfully defended the city from the advances of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. In 1543, Sher Shah Suri expelled Baloch dynasty, who under the command of Fateh Khan Mirrani had overrun the city. Following its recapture, Sher Shah Suri ordered construction of a road between Lahore and Multan to connect Multan to his massive Grand Trunk Road project. Sher Shah Suri also built (or renovated) Delhi-Multan road, the ancient trade route had existed since the time of King Ashoka or earlier. To improve transit in the areas between Delhi and Multan, leading to Kandahar and Herat in Afghanistan, eventually to Mashhad capital of Khorasan province of Iran. It then served as the starting point for trade caravans from medieval India departing towards West Asia.

====Medieval trade====

Multan served as medieval Islamic India&#x27;s trans-regional mercantile centre for trade with the Islamic world. It rose as an important trading and mercantile centre in the setting of political stability offered by the Delhi Sultanate, the Lodis, and Mughals. The renowned Arab explorer Ibn Battuta visited Multan in the 1300s during the reign of Muhammad Tughluq, and noted that Multan was a trading centre for horses imported from as far away as the Russian Steppe. Multan had also been noted to be a centre for slave-trade, though slavery was banned in the late 1300s by Muhammad Tughluq&#x27;s son, Firuz Shah Tughlaq.

The extent of Multan&#x27;s influence is also reflected in the construction of the Multani Caravanserai in Baku, Azerbaijan — which was built in the 15th to house Multani merchants visiting the city. Legal records from the Uzbek city of Bukhara note that Multani merchants settled and owned land in the city in the late 1550s.

Multan would remain an important trading centre until the city was ravaged by repeated invasions in the 18th and 19th centuries in the post-Mughal era. Many of Multan&#x27;s merchants then migrated to Shikarpur in Sindh, and were found throughout Central Asia up until the 19th century.

===Mughal period (Province of Multan)===

Following the conquest of Upper Sindh by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, Multan was attacked and captured by Akbar&#x27;s army under the command of Bairam Khan in 1557, thereby re-establishing Mughal rule in Multan. The Mughals controlled the Multani region from 1524 until around 1739. Emperor Akbar established province of Multan at Multan city, which was one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level administrative provinces) roughly covering southern Punjab, parts of Khyber and Balochistan bordering Kabul Subah, Lahore Subah, Ajmer Subah, Thatta Subah, Kandahar subah and the Persian Safavid empire. It was one of Mughal Empire&#x27;s largest provinces by land area and population.

In 1627, Multan was encircled by walls that were built on the order of Murad Baksh, son of Shah Jahan. Upon his return from an expedition to Balkh in 1648, the future emperor Aurangzeb was appointed Governor of provinces of Multan and Sindh – a post he held until 1652.

In 1680, the renowned Punjabi poet, Bulleh Shah, who is regarded as a saint by both Sufis and Sikhs, was born in Uch, Multan province.

In the second half of the 17th century, Multan&#x27;s commercial fortunes were adversely affected by silting and shifting of the nearby river, which denied traders vital trade access to the Arabian Sea. Multan witnessed difficult times as the Mughal Empire waned in power following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707.

====&quot;Dar al-Aman&quot; era====
Under Mughal rule, Multan enjoyed 200 years of peace in a time when the city became known as &quot;Dar al-&quot;Aman&quot;&quot; (&quot;Abode of Peace&quot;). During the Mughal era, Multan was an important centre of agricultural production and manufacturing of cotton textiles. Multan was a centre for currency minting, as well as tile-making during the Mughal era.

Multan was also host to the offices of many commercial enterprises during the Mughal era, even in times when the Mughals were in control of the even more coveted city of Kandahar, given the unstable political situation resulting from frequent contestation of Kandadar with the Persian Safavid Empire.

===Afsharid invasion===
Nader Shah conquered the region as part of his invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Despite invasion, Multan remained northwest India&#x27;s premier commercial centre throughout most of the 18th century.

===Durrani and Maratha invasions===
In 1752 Ahmad Shah Durrani captured Multan, the city which was also his birthplace, and the city&#x27;s walls were rebuilt in 1756 by Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan Khakwani, who also built the Ali Muhammad Khan Mosque in 1757. In 1758, the Marathas under Raghunathrao briefly seized Multan, appointing Adina Beg Khan as the Nawab of Punjab who left it in the hands of Salih Muhammad Khan, though the city was recaptured by Durrani in 1760. After repeated invasions following the collapse of the Mughal Empire, Multan was reduced from being one of the world&#x27;s most important early-modern commercial centres, to a regional trading city.

===Sikh empire===
In 1772, Ahmed Shah Durrani&#x27;s son Timur Shah lost Multan to Sikh forces. However, Multan&#x27;s association with Sikhism predates this, as the founder of the Sikh religion, Guru Nanak, is said to have visited the city during one of his journeys.

The city had reverted to Afghan rule under the suzerainty of Nawab Muzaffar Khan in 1778. In 1817, Ranjit Singh sent a body of troops to Multan under the command of Diwan Bhiwani Das to receive from Nawab Muzaffar Khan the tribute he owed to the Sikh Darbar. In 1818, the armies of Kharak Singh and Misr Diwan Chand lay around Multan without making much initial headway, until Ranjit Singh dispatched the massive &quot;Zamzama&quot; cannon, which quickly led to disintegration of the Multan&#x27;s defences. Misr Diwan Chand led Sikh armies to a decisive victory over Muzaffar Khan. Muzzafar Khan and seven of his sons were killed before the Multan fort finally fell on 2 March 1818 in the Battle of Multan.

The conquest of Multan established Ranjit Singh&#x27;s superiority over the Afghans and ended their influence in this part of the Punjab. Diwan Sawan Mal Chopra was appointed to govern the city, remaining in his post for the following 25 years. Following the Sikh conquest, Multan declined in importance as a trading post, however the population of Multan rose from approximately 40,000 in 1827 to 60,000 by 1831. Sawan Mal adopted a policy of low taxation which generated immense land revenues for the state treasury. Following the death of Ranjit Singh, he ceased paying tribute to a successor and instead maintained alliances of convenience with selected Sikh aristocrats. He was assassinated in 1844, and succeeded by his son Diwan Mulraj Chopra, who unlike his father was seen as a despotic ruler by the local inhabitants.

====1848 Multan Revolt====

The 1848 Multan Revolt and subsequent Siege of Multan began on 19 April 1848 when local Sikhs loyal to Diwan Mulraj Chopra murdered two emissaries of the British Raj, Vans Agnew and Lieutenant Anderson. The two British visitors were in Multan to attend a ceremony for Sardar Kahan Singh, who had been selected by the British East India Company to replace Diwan Mulraj Chopra as ruler of Multan.

Rebellion engulfed the Multan region under the leadership of Mulraj Chopra and Sher Singh Attariwalla. The Multan Revolt triggered the start of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, during which the &quot;sajjada nashin&quot; of the Shrine of Bahauddin Zakariya sided with the British to help defeat the Sikh rebels. The revolt eventually resulted in the fall of the Sikh Empire in 1849.

===British Raj===
By December 1848, the British had captured portions of Multan city&#x27;s outskirts, and destroyed the Multan Fort while bombarding the city. In January 1849, the British had amassed a force of 12,000 to conquer Multan. On 22 January 1849, the British had breached the walls of the Multan Fort, leading to the surrender of Mulraj and his forces to the British. The British conquest of the Sikh Empire was completed in February 1849, after the British victory at the Battle of Gujrat. Between the 1890s and 1920s, the British laid a vast network of canals in the Multan region, and throughout much of central and Southern Punjab province. Thousands of &quot;Canal Towns&quot; and villages were built according to standardized plans throughout the newly irrigated swathes of land.

===After independence of 1947===

Multan lost its very important position as soon as the British stronghold over the sub-continent grew stronger and stronger. Although peace prevailed in the region but no real progress was made. After independence was achieved in 1947, Multan had become less significant politically. Though it was still 3rd largest district and division of the country but city and the large population of South Punjab region lacked self governance. The site of the Old Fort was in ruins. Thorny bushes and ditches were in plenty whispering the awful tale of its ruination. Majority of the roads were unmetalled and the sewerage system too defective to explain.

The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India en masse, while some Muslim refugees from the newly independent Republic of India settled in the city. Today, it is one of the country&#x27;s six largest urban centres and remains an important settlement in the Southern Punjab.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Multan is located in Punjab, and covers an area of . The nearest important cities are Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur. Multan is located near few rivers of central Pakistan. The Sutlej River separates it from Bahawalpur and the Chenab River from Muzaffar Garh. The area around the city is a flat, alluvial plain surrounded by orchards and deserts that is also used for mango farms.

Multan is located near Sulaiman mountain range which is the extension of Southern Hindu Kush mountain range of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The most well-known peak of the Sulaiman mountains is the twin-peaked Takht-e-Sulaiman or &quot;Throne of Prophet Solomon&quot; at 3,487 metres (11,440 ft).

==Cityscape==

Multan&#x27;s urban typology is similar to other ancient cities in South Asia, such as Peshawar, Lahore, and Delhi, all of which were founded near a major river, and included an old walled city, as well as a royal citadel. Unlike those cities, Multan has lost its royal citadel, as it was largely destroyed by the British in 1848, which negatively impacted the urban fabric of the city.

Multan&#x27;s old neighbourhood homes exemplify Muslim concerns regarding privacy and defense against the city&#x27;s harsh climate. The urban morphology is characterized by small and private cul-de-sacs branching off of bazaars and larger arteries.

A distinct Multani style of architecture began taking root in the 14th century with the establishment of funerary monuments, and is characterized by large brick walls reinforced by wooden anchors, with inward sloping roofs. Funerary architecture is also reflected in the city&#x27;s residential quarters, which borrow architectural and decorative elements from Multan&#x27;s mausolea.

<text>James Andrew Plaskitt (born 23 June 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the member of parliament (MP) for Warwick and Leamington from 1997 until his defeat at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Born in Grimsby, Plaskitt was educated at the Pilgrim School (then a grammar school that became a comprehensive upper school in 1974 and closed down and now has the Pilgrims Pre-Preparatory School on the former site and council offices) on &quot;Brickhill Drive&quot; in Brickhill, Bedford and went up to University College, Oxford to read PPE and gained an MA. He graduated in 1976 and subsequently took a MPhil in Politics before taking up a lectureship at University College until 1979. He moved to Brunel University for four years as a lecturer in Government and then to Christ Church, Oxford from 1984 to 1986 as a lecturer. From 1985 he was a business analyst for Oxford Analytica, joining as a business consultant and later becoming consultancy director.

==Parliamentary career==
His political career began in 1985 when he was elected to Oxfordshire County Council. He was leader of the Labour group from 1990 to 1996. In the 1992 general election he contested Witney for Labour, losing by a substantial margin to the then Conservative Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. As Labour were swept to power in the 1997 general election landslide, Plaskitt was elected MP for the previously Conservative constituency of Warwick and Leamington, beating the incumbent Dudley Smith into second place. He served on the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee from 1999, and in the 2001 general election was re-elected with an increased margin, although on a lower turnout. He is a strong supporter of reforming the law on assisted dying, tackling child poverty and expanding further education. He spoke out against Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza and called for urgent reform of international banking regulation. Plaskitt tended to vote with the government on major issues such as university tuition fees and foundation hospitals. He made clear that he would only ever support increases in university tuition fees which were matched by increases in Government grants for less well-off students, and he played a leading role in supporting Warwick Hospital&#x27;s application for Trust status. He is notable among Labour MPs in that he did not vote for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

After the general election in May 2005, Plaskitt was appointed as a junior minister in the Department for Work and Pensions. He left the Gordon Brown Government by mutual agreement in October 2008, and was re-appointed to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee in July 2009. Plaskitt was one of 98 MPs who voted against the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act concerning MPs&#x27; addresses applying to Members of Parliament.

Plaskitt lost to the Conservative candidate, Chris White in the 2010 general election by 3,513 votes, a swing to the Conservatives of 8.2%. The Warwick and Leamington constituency saw a very high 71% turnout.

==Other work==
Since leaving Parliament, he has co-written &quot;The Pigeon House&quot;, published in 2011.

Plaskitt&#x27;s face was used as the model for the character of Colonel George Blake in the 2001 computer game &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis&quot;.

In 2012 Plaskitt was selected as the Labour candidate for the Police and Crime Commissioner election for the Warwickshire Police. In the election on 15 November 2012 he came runner-up to Ron Ball the Independent candidate.

<text>Kerry Patrick Pollard (born 27 April 1944) is a Labour politician in the United Kingdom. He was elected at the general election of 1997 as Member of Parliament for St Albans, and held the seat until his defeat at the general election of 2005.

==Early life==
Pollard was brought up in Rochdale. He attended the Catholic Thornleigh Salesian College in Astley Bridge, Bolton. He has an Open University Bachelor of Arts degree in industrial relations and urban regeneration.

== Before Parliament ==
Pollard was a Housing Association director, interested in social justice and social inclusion. He finished in third place in what would mark his first attempt to be elected as the MP for the constituency of St Albans at the general election of 1992. From 1962 to 1992, Pollard was a Chemical Engineer for British Gas plc. He was subsequently Chief Executive of Cherry Tree Housing Association from 1992 to 1997. Since 1984, he has been a magistrate.

In 1982, he became a councillor on St Albans District Council, where he remained until 1997. He was also a councillor on Hertfordshire County Council from 1989 to 1997.

== Parliamentary career ==
Kerry Pollard raised an early day motion in the House of Commons on Monday 19 April 1999, in support of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society&#x27;s fight to stay mutual. He urged Bradford &amp; Bingley members to vote against moves to force Britain&#x27;s second largest building society to convert to a bank, saying &quot;the early day motion will express the fear that were Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society to become a bank, the entire building society movement will be damaged directly.&quot;

In the United Kingdom Parliament, Pollard opposed the wars led by the United States in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, but his most consistent aberrations from the party instructions were over benefits – he voted on several occasions against cuts in state benefits. Pollard chaired the all party small business group.

A Christian socialist, Pollard took a conservative line on questions of personal morality: he was a member of the all party anti-abortion group, and was one of a handful of Labour MPs to oppose the equalisation of the age of consent. As an MP, he appeared on former BBC day time chat show &quot;Kilroy&quot;, contributing to topics such as the problem of personal debt, with comments including &quot;Surely the banks have some sort of responsibility?&quot;.

== After Parliament ==
Kerry Pollard joined the management board of Ridgehill Housing Association in 2005, rising to become, upon merging with William Sutton Housing Association, the chair of William Sutton Homes. Following the merger of the William Sutton Group and Affinity Homes Group on 1 October 2006, Pollard was removed as chair of William Sutton Homes on 25 April 2007, after he had complained to the Housing Association about the behaviour of the new parent company.

Pollard chaired the &quot;Labour Housing Group&quot; until 2016.

=== Further election attempts ===
In the 2015 general election, Pollard stood again as the Labour Party candidate for the St. Albans constituency. He polled second with 23%, below the Conservative Party candidate and incumbent Anne Main, who unseated him in 2005, with 47%.

A second attempt in the 2017 general election saw Pollard fare worse; the Labour Party retained 23% of the vote, but fell to third place behind Liberal Democrat candidate Daisy Cooper (who would be elected to the seat in 2019) with 32%, and the incumbent Main at 43%.

==Personal life==
He married Maralyn Murphy in 1966, and they have five sons and two daughters. They have lived in St Albans since 1969.

<doc id="433851" wikidata="Q1939771" url="?curid=433851" title="Orgeat syrup">
<text>Orgeat syrup is a sweet syrup made from almonds and sugar with a little rose water and/or orange flower water. It was originally made with a barley-almond blend. It has a pronounced almond taste and is used to flavor many cocktails. Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many Tiki drinks.

==History==
An early recipe for orgeat can be found in &quot;The English and Australian Cookery Book&quot;: 

Bitter almonds as a general rule contain cyanide and can be lethal in large quantities. For this reason modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption unless the person is allergic.

==Word origin==
The word &quot;orgeat&quot; () is derived from the Latin &#x27;made with barley&#x27; through the French, where barley is called . The Catalan word , from which derives the Spanish , has the same origin, though today the two drinks have little else in common and neither of them uses barley.

==Regional uses==
In Tunisia and Libya, a variant is called &quot;rozata&quot; and is usually served chilled in wedding and engagement parties as a symbol of joy and purity because of its white colour and its fresh (flowery) flavor. It comes in many different flavours, such as traditional almond, banana, mango, pistachio, among others.

In Suriname, there is a drink called , which is a similar syrup made of sugar and sweet and bitter almonds.

Maltese is made of almond and vanilla essence and may include cinnamon and cloves. 

In Cyprus and on the Greek islands of Chios and Nisyros, a similar syrup is known as (). Soumada has a very ancient history at least in Cyprus, stretching back into the Roman period, and it was given as an exotic delicacy by King Peter I of Cyprus to King Casimir the Great of Poland at the Congress of Kraków, held in Poland in 1364.

From 1974 to 1975, he was a research assistant in Economics at Birkbeck College. From 1975 to 1979, he was a research officer at the Low Pay Unit, and subsequently became its director, taking over from Frank Field. He lectured in economics at the Civil Service College (now called the National School of Government) from 1979 to 1980.

<text>Gregory James Pope (born 29 August 1960) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hyndburn from 1992, until retiring at the general election of 2010. He was a government whip from 1997 until 2001.

==Early life==
Pope was born and raised in Great Harwood, the only son of Sam and Sheila Pope. He went to St Marys College R.C. Grammar School on &quot;Shear Brow&quot; in Blackburn, now St Mary&#x27;s Sixth Form College, Blackburn. He studied Politics at the University of Hull, graduating in 1981.

Pope was elected to serve on Hyndburn Borough Council in 1984 until 1988, and he also served briefly on Blackburn Borough Council from 1989 to 1990.

==Parliamentary career==
Pope unsuccessfully fought Ribble Valley at the election of 1987, placing third, before gaining Hyndburn from the Conservative Ken Hargreaves in April 1992. Considered a Blairite, Pope is a signatory of the Henry Jackson Society. He was a member of the backbench committee on Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2001.

In April 2000, as a whip, Pope inadvertently approved a Liberal Democrat clause in the government&#x27;s utilities bill, committing the government to meet 10% of electricity requirements from green sources by 2010. Pope said: “We were doing a series of government amendments. I realised I&#x27;d shouted aye too many times. I&#x27;m not overjoyed about it.” The error led the government to instruct its MPs to vote against the clause.

In July 2003, Pope admitted leaking confidential Foreign Affairs Select Committee evidence, to &quot;The Guardian&quot; chief political correspondent Patrick Wintour. The move was described as an attempt to “bounce” MPs on the committee into clearing Alastair Campbell of “sexing up” the so called Dodgy Dossier. This was of evidence into the threat, posed by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

On 11 June 2009, Pope announced that he would stand down at the 2010 Election. In November 2009, Graham Jones, who later became his successor, was chosen as an candidate to succeed him by Labour. In April 2010, he revealed he nearly didn&#x27;t stand in 2005. However, quite a few of his friends and family talked to him and persuaded him to have one more term, which he did have.

==Parliamentary expenses==
In December 2009, Greg Pope claimed £21,613 in expenses in a single year (2008–2009) and £7,295 of &quot; Additional Cost Allowance&quot;, which included household furnishings and mortgage payments. This was over a two-year period.

==After politics==
On 19 April 2010, Pope was appointed as the deputy director of the Catholic Education Service (CES). In March 2017, he left the CES to become the Assistant General Secretary of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England &amp; Wales; in October 2019 he became its Executive Director, and in November 2024 its General Secretary.

==Personal life==
He married Catherine Fallon on 2 August 1985; they have three children. Catherine, known as Kate, is the General Secretary of the Association of Educational Psychologists, a registered trade union representing educational psychologists working in the United Kingdom. Their son, Conor, was previously deputy editor of pressure group by New Labour, Progress.

<text>Bridget Theresa Prentice (&#x27;Corr; born 28 December 1952) is a Scottish politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewisham East from 1992 to 2010. She was married to the Labour MP Gordon Prentice from 1975 until their divorce in 2000. She was a member of the Labour Party until May 2019, when she resigned in protest at Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.

== Background ==
Bridget Prentice was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 28 December 1952. She attended Our Lady and St Francis School, the University of Glasgow (MA English Literature and Modern History 1973), the University of London (PGCE 1974) and South Bank Polytechnic (LLB 1992).

After beginning her working life as the Rector&#x27;s Assistant at the University of Glasgow (1972–73), she became a history and English teacher at the Roman Catholic London Oratory School in Fulham (1974–86) and later Head of Careers (1984–86), before switching to John Archer School in Wandsworth as Head of Careers between 1986 and 1988.

==Member of Parliament==
Prentice was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1987 general election, when she stood for Croydon Central. She contested Lewisham East at the 1992 election; its incumbent Conservative MP Colin Moynihan had a majority of 4,814. Prentice gained it for Labour with a majority of 1,095, and increased the majority to 12,127 in 1997. In subsequent general elections she held the seat with reduced majorities of 9,003 in 2001, and 6,751 in 2005.

Appointed a Labour Whip in 1995 by Tony Blair, she continued in the role on Labour entering government in May 1997, before becoming PPS to the Minister for Trade (1998–1999), and then PPS to the Lord Chancellor (1999–2001); she then left government in 2001 to become a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee (2001–2003).

Prentice rejoined the government in 2003, appointed again to the Government Whips&#x27; Office. She later became a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, continuing in the role in the department&#x27;s successor, the Ministry of Justice.

Within the department, she was responsible for reform of electoral administration, legal services, legal services complaints, legal services commissioner and ombudsman, asylum and immigration, devolution and regional policy. In December 2008, she was reprimanded by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards John Lyon, for misusing her communications allowance. She agreed to pay back the money, which had been spent on sending party political literature to voters who were outside her constituency, but who would join it at the next election as the result of boundary changes.

In April 2009, Prentice announced her decision to stand down from Parliament at the following election. She has close ties to Bonus Pastor Secondary School in Lewisham, accepting one pupil every year for work experience, which included work within the constituency and the Houses of Parliament.

==Personal life==
Although a Roman Catholic, Prentice has been a Governor at Trinity Church of England All Through School since 2010. In September 2013, she was elected chair of its governing body. She resigned from her membership of the Labour Party in May 2019.

Prentice was a participant in the 2022-23 series of the quiz show &quot;Only Connect&quot;, in the team &quot;Jugadores&quot;.

<text>Gordon Prentice (born 28 January 1951) is a British-Canadian former politician of the Labour Party who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Pendle in Lancashire from 1992 to 2010.

==Early life==
He was educated at the independent George Heriot&#x27;s School in Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, where he received an MA in Politics and Economics in 1975, and was president of the union. He then worked for the Labour Party Policy Directorate from 1982 to 1992.

Prior to becoming an MP, Prentice was the leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council from 1986 to 1988.

==Parliamentary career==
Prentice was initially selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Pendle in October 1990, and was first elected at the 1992 general election with a majority of 2,113. He delivered his maiden speech a month later, on 13 May, in a debate on the economy, in which he wished his predecessor well for the future. Prentice held the constituency at the 1997 general election with a greatly increased majority of 10,824, the largest ever in Pendle and its predecessor constituency of Nelson and Colne. However, his majority was reduced to 4,275 at the 2001 general election and to 2,180 in 2005. 

In 1999, Prentice introduced a Right to Roam Bill as a private member&#x27;s bill, which aimed to establish a freedom to roam over certain upland and uncultivated areas of England and Wales. This became law in November 2000 as the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

Prentice campaigned against fox hunting and in May 2000 tabled an amendment to the government&#x27;s Hunting Bill, vowing not to withdraw it unless the government gave a &quot;cast-iron statement&quot; that promised to introduce legislation before the next election. This resulted in protests outside his constituency office in Nelson in July 2000, despite protesters knowing he was in London. By 2002, Prentice was campaigning for fox hunting with dogs to be completely banned, asking the government to bring back the previous year&#x27;s bill and to force it through parliament. He later became a target of the Countryside Alliance, who named him top of a &quot;most wanted&quot; list published in December 2003 and attempted to remove him as an MP at the next election. 

In 2000, Prentice organised hustings for the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons, and later branded the election system &quot;a farce&quot; when interviewed by BBC One. He also said that neither ministers nor the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party should get involved in the election.

Prentice was angrily told off by Tony Blair in October 2004, when he asked during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions if there had been any single act of renewal in the Labour Party within the ten years Blair had been the party leader. He had previously been warned by the party in 1996 when he criticised Blair&#x27;s performance as opposition leader. He then subsequently pledged his support for Blair the following week.

In 2005, Prentice was appointed to parliament&#x27;s Public Administration Committee. Two years later, he called for tax-exiled peers to be removed from the House of Lords.

In March 2006, Prentice spoke out against the proposed merger of Lancashire Constabulary with Cumbria Constabulary. He later welcomed the merger being called off, saying it wasn’t appropriate for taxpayers in Lancashire to pay higher tax bills than those living in Cumbria. He called for &quot;merger rethink&quot; in the House of Commons shortly before the plans were announced.
Prentice was one of the few Labour MPs not to endorse Gordon Brown for the 2007 Labour Leadership, nominating left-winger John McDonnell for the role instead. The following year, he became the second MP (after Graham Stringer) to call for Brown to resign, remarking that &quot;the prime minister needs different sets of skills from a Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;. 

After allegations involving Sophie, Countess of Wessex in April 2001, Prentice stated his belief that members of the British Royal Family should register their financial and business interests, like MPs. He also claimed he was &quot;shocked by revelations&quot; involving her.

Prentice lost his seat at the 2010 election and announced he would not stand at the next election, stating he was now a private citizen.

==Expenses scandal==
In December 2009, Prentice was criticised for claiming £2,262 for items bought at John Lewis, including £749 for a television, £649 for a fridge-freezer and other amounts for various items of furniture. Prentice also claimed mortgage payments that amounted to £19,564 in 2004–05, £20,211 in 2005–06, £21,806 in 2006–07, £20,313 in 2007–08 and £19,508 in 2008–09. Following the scandal, Prentice did not claim anything for the first quarter of 2009–10. Prentice was among 625 other MPs at the time who received letters regarding the scandal, and paid back £2,620 to the House of Commons due to new, retrospective rules for expenses created by an external auditor. The auditor stressed that their findings carried no implication or innuendo about the conduct or motive of MPs.

==Personal life==
Prentice married Bridget Prentice (née Corr), later also an MP for Lewisham East, whom he had met while at university. The couple divorced in 2000 after being separated for three years. Prentice subsequently married Heather Halliday in 2011.

Prentice revealed in July 2008 how he had become a victim of credit card fraud two months earlier in Yorkshire, and how he lost £3,500 after his card was copied with the use of a &quot;skimming&quot; device.

Soon after losing his seat in 2010, Prentice described the moment in 1998 when he was &quot;nearly killed&quot; by a man wielding a sledgehammer. 

Following his election defeat, Prentice moved to Newmarket, Ontario, Canada. He ran for Deputy Mayor of Newmarket in 2022.

<text>Michael Mark Prisk (born 12 June 1962) is a British politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hertford and Stortford from 2001 until 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Minister of State for Business and Enterprise from 2010 to 2012 and Minister of State for Housing and Local Government from 2012 to 2013.

==Early life==
Prisk was born at Redruth, Cornwall and whilst living at Camborne was educated at the fee-paying Truro School in 1973–80. He went on to study Land Management at the University of Reading, gaining a BSc degree. From 1983 to 1985, he was Chairman of the Youth Section of Peace through NATO. He was vice-chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students in 1982–83.

After graduation, Prisk worked in property and economic development and rose to become director of a £3 million practice. From 1983 to 1985, he worked as a graduate surveyor for Knight Frank, then as development surveyor for Derrick Wade &amp; Waters where he became manager of the London office from 1985 to 1989. He was a marketing director from 1989 to 1991, then principal of the Mark Prisk Connection from 1991 to 1997. From 1997 to 2001, he was company owner of MP2.

==Parliamentary career==
Prisk was Chairman of Cornwall Young Conservatives and after unsuccessfully contesting Newham North West in 1992 and Wansdyke in 1997, he was finally elected as the Conservative MP for the constituency of Hertford and Stortford in 2001. He was promoted from the backbenches to the Opposition frontbench as Shadow Financial Secretary, Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs, an opposition whip and Shadow Minister for Business and Enterprise. He is author of several pamphlets on urban design.

On 26 July 2007, David Cameron appointed Prisk as Shadow Minister for Cornwall, although there was no formal government post for him to shadow. The party said the move was intended to help place the county&#x27;s concerns &quot;at the heart of Conservative thinking&quot;. Cameron said he endorsed the appointment and it would ensure the voice of Cornwall was heard. Liberal Democrat Matthew Taylor claimed the appointment was a bid to get around the rule which requires MPs to limit the local cases they take up to their own constituencies, as the Conservatives had no MPs in Cornwall. Prisk defended his role in open letter to the &quot;Falmouth Packet&quot;, noting &quot;as a born and bred Cornishman&quot; his role was to listen to the concerns of people in Cornwall, feed these back to the Shadow Cabinet and make sure Conservative policies properly reflected the needs of Cornwall.

No Minister for Cornwall was appointed after the 2010 election; Prisk was appointed as Minister of State for Business and Enterprise in the Cameron–Clegg coalition, until he was shifted to become Minister of State for Housing and Local Government on 5 September 2012. In this role, he was responsible for creating a &quot;Future High Street Forum&quot; to support struggling High Street retailers, but was asked to step down from the frontbench in an October 2013 reshuffle.

Prisk campaigned to remain in the European Union in the lead-up to the 2016 referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership and his constituency narrowly voted to remain by 50.76% to 49.24%. However, after the referendum result, he supported the Theresa May&#x27;s plan for implementation of Britain&#x27;s withdrawal.

On 9 September 2019, Prisk wrote to the chairman of his local Conservative Association to declare he would not be standing at the next general election.

During November 2022, Prisk announced his position as president of the Conservative Mental Health Group (CMHG). Previous to this role Prisk had supported mental health charities, including the Samaritans and Mind.

==Personal life==
Prisk married Lesley Titcomb, who became CEO at The Pensions Regulator, in April 1989 in Oxfordshire.

<text>Gwynfor Matthews Prosser (born 27 April 1943) is a British politician and engineer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover from 1997 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he worked as a marine engineer and served on Dover District Council and Kent County Council prior to his election to Parliament.

==Early life and career==
Gwynfor Matthews Prosser was born on 27 April 1943 in Swansea, Wales. He was educated at Dunvant Secondary Modern School and gained a National Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Swansea Technical College.

Prosser began his marine engineering career in 1960, as a Merchant Navy cadet engineer, and was later employed at BP and Blue Funnel Line. He became as a senior engineer in the 1970s, working for BR Shipping, John Kincaid of Greenock, Aramco in Saudi Arabia, and Anscar. Prosser was chief engineer for Sealink Ferries in Dover from 1979 to 1992. 

During his engineering career, he served on the executive of the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers. Between the 1992 and 1997 general elections, he was a social survey interviewer for the civil service.

==Political career==
Elected to Dover District Council in 1987 and Kent County Council in 1989, he served as a committee chair on both during his tenure in the roles.

Prosser was elected as Member of Parliament for the Dover constituency at the 1997 general election, defeating incumbent Conservative David Shaw. He had unsuccessfully contested the seat at the 1992 general election, but substantially reduced Shaw&#x27;s majority to less than 900 votes. 

Re-elected in 2001 and 2005, Prosser was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee from 2001 to 2010. He was defeated by Conservative Charlie Elphicke at the 2010 general election, and subsequently retired from politics.

==Personal life==
Prosser married his wife in 1972, with whom he had two daughters and one son.

<doc id="433875" wikidata="Q320245" url="?curid=433875" title="Derived functor">
<text>In mathematics, certain functors may be &quot;derived&quot; to obtain other functors closely related to the original ones. This operation, while fairly abstract, unifies a number of constructions throughout mathematics.

== Motivation ==

It was noted in various quite different settings that a short exact sequence often gives rise to a &quot;long exact sequence&quot;. The concept of derived functors explains and clarifies many of these observations.

Suppose we are given a covariant left exact functor &quot;F&quot; : A → B between two abelian categories A and B. If 0 → &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot; → 0 is a short exact sequence in A, then applying &quot;F&quot; yields the exact sequence 0 → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) and one could ask how to continue this sequence to the right to form a long exact sequence. Strictly speaking, this question is ill-posed, since there are always numerous different ways to continue a given exact sequence to the right. But it turns out that (if A is &quot;nice&quot; enough) there is one canonical way of doing so, given by the right derived functors of &quot;F&quot;. For every &quot;i&quot;≥1, there is a functor &quot;RiF&quot;: A → B, and the above sequence continues like so: 0 → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;2&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;R&quot;2&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) → ... . From this we see that &quot;F&quot; is an exact functor if and only if &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot; = 0; so in a sense the right derived functors of &quot;F&quot; measure &quot;how far&quot; &quot;F&quot; is from being exact.

If the object &quot;A&quot; in the above short exact sequence is injective, then the sequence splits. Applying any additive functor to a split sequence results in a split sequence, so in particular &quot;R&quot;1&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = 0. Right derived functors (for &quot;i&gt;0&quot;) are zero on injectives: this is the motivation for the construction given below.

== Construction and first properties ==

The crucial assumption we need to make about our abelian category A is that it has &quot;enough injectives&quot;, meaning that for every object &quot;A&quot; in A there exists a monomorphism &quot;A&quot; → &quot;I&quot; where &quot;I&quot; is an injective object in A.

The right derived functors of the covariant left-exact functor &quot;F&quot; : A → B are then defined as follows. Start with an object &quot;X&quot; of A. Because there are enough injectives, we can construct a long exact sequence of the form
:formula_1
where the &quot;I&quot; &quot;i&quot; are all injective (this is known as an &quot;injective resolution&quot; of &quot;X&quot;). Applying the functor &quot;F&quot; to this sequence, and chopping off the first term, we obtain the cochain complex

:formula_2

Note: this is in general &quot;not&quot; an exact sequence anymore. But we can compute its cohomology at the &quot;i&quot;-th spot (the kernel of the map from &quot;F&quot;(&quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;) modulo the image of the map to &quot;F&quot;(&quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;)); we call the result &quot;RiF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Of course, various things have to be checked: the result does not depend on the given injective resolution of &quot;X&quot;, and any morphism &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; naturally yields a morphism &quot;RiF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) → &quot;RiF&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;), so that we indeed obtain a functor. Note that left exactness means that
0 → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;I&quot;0) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;I&quot;1)
is exact, so &quot;R&quot;0&quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), so we only get something interesting for &quot;i&quot;&gt;0.

(Technically, to produce well-defined derivatives of &quot;F&quot;, we would have to fix an injective resolution for every object of A. This choice of injective resolutions then yields functors &quot;RiF&quot;. Different choices of resolutions yield naturally isomorphic functors, so in the end the choice doesn&#x27;t really matter.)

The above-mentioned property of turning short exact sequences into long exact sequences is a consequence of the snake lemma. This tells us that the collection of derived functors is a δ-functor.

If &quot;X&quot; is itself injective, then we can choose the injective resolution 0 → &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; → 0, and we obtain that &quot;RiF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 1. In practice, this fact, together with the long exact sequence property, is often used to compute the values of right derived functors.

An equivalent way to compute &quot;RiF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the following: take an injective resolution of &quot;X&quot; as above, and let &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the image of the map &quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1→&quot;Ii&quot; (for &quot;i&quot;=0, define &quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1=0), which is the same as the kernel of &quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;→&quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1. Let φ&quot;i&quot; : &quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1→&quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the corresponding surjective map. Then &quot;RiF&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the cokernel of &quot;F&quot;(φ&quot;i&quot;).

== Variations ==

If one starts with a covariant &quot;right-exact&quot; functor formula_3, and the category A has enough projectives (i.e. for every object formula_4 of A there exists an epimorphism formula_5 where formula_6 is a projective object), then one can define analogously the left-derived functors formula_7. For an object formula_8 of A we first construct a projective resolution of the form
:formula_9
where the formula_10 are projective. We apply formula_3 to this sequence, chop off the last term, and compute homology to get formula_12. As before, formula_13.

In this case, the long exact sequence will grow &quot;to the left&quot; rather than to the right:
:formula_14
is turned into 
:formula_15.

Left derived functors are zero on all projective objects.

One may also start with a &quot;contravariant&quot; left-exact functor formula_16; the resulting right-derived functors are then also contravariant. The short exact sequence

:formula_14

is turned into the long exact sequence

:formula_18

These left derived functors are zero on projectives and are therefore computed via projective resolutions.

== Examples ==

* If formula_4 is an abelian category, then its category of morphisms formula_20 is also abelian. The functor formula_21 which maps each morphism to its kernel is left exact. Its right derived functors are 
::formula_22 
:Dually the functor formula_23 is right exact and its left derived functors are 
::formula_24 
:This is a manifestation of the snake lemma.

=== Homology and cohomology ===

====Sheaf cohomology====
If formula_8 is a topological space, then the category formula_26 of all sheaves of abelian groups on formula_8 is an abelian category with enough injectives. The functor formula_28 which assigns to each such sheaf formula_29 the group formula_30 of global sections is left exact, and the right derived functors are the sheaf cohomology functors, usually written as formula_31. Slightly more generally: if formula_32 is a ringed space, then the category of all sheaves of formula_33-modules is an abelian category with enough injectives, and we can again construct sheaf cohomology as the right derived functors of the global section functor.

There are various notions of cohomology which are a special case of this:

* De Rham cohomology is the sheaf cohomology of the sheaf of locally constant formula_34-valued functions on a manifold. The De Rham complex is a resolution of this sheaf not by injective sheaves, but by fine sheaves.
* Étale cohomology is another cohomology theory for sheaves over a scheme. It is the right derived functor of the global sections of abelian sheaves on the étale site.

====Ext functors====
If formula_35 is a ring, then the category of all left formula_35-modules is an abelian category with enough injectives. If formula_4 is a fixed left formula_35-module, then the functor formula_39 is left exact, and its right derived functors are the Ext functors formula_40. Alternatively formula_41 can also be obtained as the left derived functor of the right exact functor formula_42.

Various notions of cohomology are special cases of Ext functors and therefore also derived functors.

* Group cohomology is the right derived functor of the invariants functor formula_43 which is the same as formula_44 (where formula_45 is the trivial formula_46-module) and therefore formula_47.
* Lie algebra cohomology of a Lie algebra formula_48 over some commutative ring formula_45 is the right derived functor of the invariants functor formula_50 which is the same as formula_51 (where formula_45 is again the trivial formula_48-module and formula_54 is the universal enveloping algebra of formula_48). Therefore formula_56.
*Hochschild cohomology of some formula_45-algebra formula_4 is the right derived functor of invariants formula_59 mapping a bimodule formula_60 to its center, also called its set of invariants formula_61 which is the same as formula_62 (where formula_63 is the enveloping algebra of formula_4 and formula_4 is considered an formula_66-bimodule via the usual left and right multiplication). Therefore formula_67:

====Tor functors====
The category of left formula_35-modules also has enough projectives. If formula_4 is a fixed right formula_35-module, then the tensor product with formula_4 gives a right exact covariant functor formula_72; The category of modules has enough projectives so that left derived functors always exists. The left derived functors of the tensor functor are the Tor functors formula_73. Equivalently formula_74 can be defined symmetrically as the left derived functors of formula_75. In fact one can combine both definitions and define formula_76 as the left derived of formula_77.

This includes several notions of homology as special cases. This often mirrors the situation with Ext functors and cohomology.

* Group homology is the left derived functor of taking coinvariants formula_78 which is the same as formula_79.
* Lie algebra homology is the left derived functor of taking coinvariants formula_80 which is the same as formula_81.
* Hochschild homology is the left derived functor of taking coinvariants formula_82 which is the same as formula_83.

Instead of taking individual left derived functors one can also take the total derived functor of the tensor functor. This gives rise to the derived tensor product formula_84 where formula_85 is the derived category.

== Naturality ==

Derived functors and the long exact sequences are &quot;natural&quot; in several technical senses.

First, given a commutative diagram of the form

:formula_86

(where the rows are exact), the two resulting long exact sequences are related by commuting squares:

Second, suppose η : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;G&quot; is a natural transformation from the left exact functor &quot;F&quot; to the left exact functor &quot;G&quot;. Then natural transformations &quot;Ri&quot;η : &quot;RiF&quot; → &quot;RiG&quot; are induced, and indeed &quot;Ri&quot; becomes a functor from the functor category of all left exact functors from A to B to the full functor category of all functors from A to B. Furthermore, this functor is compatible with the long exact sequences in the following sense: if
:formula_87
is a short exact sequence, then a commutative diagram

is induced.

Both of these naturalities follow from the naturality of the sequence provided by the snake lemma.

Conversely, the following characterization of derived functors holds: given a family of functors &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;: A → B, satisfying the above, i.e. mapping short exact sequences to long exact sequences, such that for every injective object &quot;I&quot; of A, &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;I&quot;)=0 for every positive &quot;i&quot;, then these functors are the right derived functors of &quot;R&quot;0.

== Generalization ==

The more modern (and more general) approach to derived functors uses the language of derived categories.

In 1968 Quillen developed the theory of model categories, which give an abstract category-theoretic system of fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences. Typically one is interested in the underlying homotopy category obtained by localizing against the weak equivalences. A Quillen adjunction is an adjunction between model categories that descends to an adjunction between the homotopy categories. For example, the category of topological spaces and the category of simplicial sets both admit Quillen model structures whose nerve and realization adjunction gives a Quillen adjunction that is in fact an equivalence of homotopy categories. Particular objects in a model structure have “nice properties” (concerning the existence of lifts against particular morphisms), the “fibrant” and “cofibrant” objects, and every object is weakly equivalent to a fibrant-cofibrant “resolution.”

Although originally developed to handle the category of topological spaces Quillen model structures appear in numerous places in mathematics; in particular the category of chain complexes from any Abelian category (modules, sheaves of modules on a topological space or scheme, etc.) admit a model structure whose weak equivalences are those morphisms between chain complexes preserving homology. Often we have a functor between two such model categories (e.g. the global sections functor sending a complex of Abelian sheaves to the obvious complex of Abelian groups) that preserves weak equivalences &quot;within the subcategory of “good” (fibrant or cofibrant) objects&quot;. By first taking a fibrant or cofibrant resolution of an object and then applying that functor, we have successfully extended it to the whole category in such a way that weak equivalences are always preserved (and hence it descends to a functor from the homotopy category). This is the “derived functor.” The “derived functors” of sheaf cohomology, for example, are the homologies of the output of this derived functor. Applying these to a sheaf of Abelian groups interpreted in the obvious way as a complex concentrated in homology, they measure the failure of the global sections functor to preserve weak equivalences of such, its failure of “exactness.” General theory of model structures shows the uniqueness of this construction (that it does not depend of choice of fibrant or cofibrant resolution, etc.)

<text>The cubical atom was an early atomic model in which electrons were positioned at the eight corners of a cube in a non-polar atom or molecule. This theory was developed in 1902 by Gilbert N. Lewis and published in 1916 in the article &quot;The Atom and the Molecule&quot; and used to account for the phenomenon of valency. 
Lewis&#x27; theory was based on Abegg&#x27;s rule. It was further developed in 1919 by Irving Langmuir as the cubical octet atom. The figure below shows structural representations for elements of the second row of the periodic table.

Although the cubical model of the atom was soon abandoned in favor of the quantum mechanical model based on the Schrödinger equation, and is therefore now principally of historical interest, it represented an important step towards the understanding of the chemical bond. The 1916 article by Lewis also introduced the concept of the electron pair in the covalent bond, the octet rule, and the now-called Lewis structure.

==Bonding in the cubical atom model==

Single covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share an edge, as in structure C below. This results in the sharing of two electrons. Ionic bonds are formed by the transfer of an electron from one cube to another without sharing an edge (structure A). An intermediate state where only one corner is shared (structure B) was also postulated by Lewis.

Double bonds are formed by sharing a face between two cubic atoms. This results in sharing four electrons:

Triple bonds could not be accounted for by the cubical atom model, because there is no way of having two cubes share three parallel edges. Lewis suggested that the electron pairs in atomic bonds have a special attraction, which result in a tetrahedral structure, as in the figure below (the new location of the electrons is represented by the dotted circles in the middle of the thick edges). This allows the formation of a single bond by sharing a corner, a double bond by sharing an edge, and a triple bond by sharing a face. It also accounts for the free rotation around single bonds and for the tetrahedral geometry of methane.
