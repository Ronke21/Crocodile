<text>Bihar (; ) is a state in Eastern India. It is the second largest state by population, the 12th largest by area, and the 15th largest by GDP in 2021. Bihar borders Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and Jharkhand to the south. Bihar is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east. On 15 November 2000, southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand. Only 11.27% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas as per a 2020 report. Additionally, almost 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25, giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state. The official language is Hindi, which shares official status alongside that of Urdu. The main native languages are Maithili, Magahi and Bhojpuri. But there are several other languages being spoken at smaller levels.

In Ancient and Classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered the centre of political and cultural power and as a haven of learning. Parshvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankar led the shramana order in this region in 9th century BCE. Jainism was revived and re-organised by Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar in 6th century BCE. From Magadha arose India&#x27;s first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world&#x27;s most widely adhered-to religions: Buddhism. Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule. Another region of Bihar, Mithila, was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.

However, since the late 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in terms of social and economic development. Many economists and social scientists claim that this is a direct result of the policies of the central government, such as the freight equalisation policy, its apathy towards Bihar, lack of Bihari sub-nationalism, and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company. The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state. Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure, better healthcare facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Bihar&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit and Pali word &quot;vihāra&quot; (Devanagari: विहार), meaning &quot;abode&quot; and usually referred to a Buddhist monastery. The region roughly encompassing the present state had many Buddhist vihāras, the abodes of Buddhist monks in the ancient and medieval periods.

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===
Chirand, on the northern bank of the Ganga River, in Saran district, has an archaeological record from the Neolithic age . Regions of Bihar – such as Magadha, Mithila, and Anga – are mentioned in religious texts and epics of ancient India.

Mithila gained prominence after the establishment of the Videha Kingdom. During the late Vedic period Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas. Sita, a daughter of one of the Janaks of Mithila is mentioned as the consort of Lord Rama, in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, written by Valmiki. The Videha Kingdom later became incorporated into the Vajjika League which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila. Vajji had a republican form of government where the head of state was elected from the rajas. Based on the information found in texts pertaining to Jainism and Buddhism, Vajji was established as a republic by the sixth century BCE, before the birth of Gautama Buddha in 563 BCE, making it the first known republic in India.

The Haryanka dynasty, founded in 684 BCE, ruled Magadha from the city of Rajgriha (modern Rajgir). The two well-known kings from this dynasty were Bimbisara and his son Ajatashatru, who imprisoned his father to ascend the throne. Ajatashatru founded the city of Pataliputra which later became the capital of Magadha. He declared war and conquered the Vajjika League. The Haryanka dynasty was followed by the Shishunaga dynasty. Later, the Nanda dynasty ruled a vast tract stretching from Punjab to Odisha.
The Nanda dynasty was replaced by the Maurya Empire, India&#x27;s first empire. The Maurya Empire and the religion of Buddhism arose in the region that now makes up modern Bihar. The Mauryan Empire, which originated from Magadha in 321 BCE, was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, who was born in Magadha. It had its capital at Pataliputra (modern Patna). Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, who was born in Pataliputra (Patna), is often considered to be among the one of most accomplished rulers in world history.

The Gupta Empire, which originated in Magadha in 240 CE, is referred to as the Golden Age of India in science, mathematics, astronomy, commerce, religion, and Indian philosophy. Bihar and Bengal were invaded by Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty in the 11th century.

=== Medieval period ===
Buddhism in Magadha declined due to the invasion of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, during which many of the viharas were destroyed along with the universities of Nalanda and Vikramashila. Some historians believe that thousands of Buddhist monks were massacred during the 12th century. D. N. Jha suggests, instead, that these incidents were the result of Buddhist–Brahmin skirmishes in a fight for supremacy. After the rule of the Pala Empire, the Karnat dynasty came into power in the Mithila region in the 11th century and they were succeeded by the Oiniwar dynasty in the 14th century. Aside from Mithila, there were other small kingdoms in medieval Bihar. The area around Bodh Gaya and much of Magadha came under the Buddhist Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya. The Khayaravala dynasty were present in the southwestern portions of the state until the 13th century.

Many famous Buddhist and Hindu philosophers and scholars have originated or studied in Bihar during the period from the 5th to 13th century at institutions like Nalanda and Vikramashila including Kamalaśīla, Ratnākaraśānti, Śāntarakṣita, Abhayakaragupta, Udayana and Gaṅgeśa.
=== Colonial era ===
After the Battle of Buxar (1764), the British East India Company obtained the diwani rights (rights to administer and collect tax revenue) for Bihar, Bengal, and Odisha. The rich resources of fertile land, water, and skilled labour had attracted the foreign imperialists, particularly the Dutch and British, in the 18th century. A number of agriculture-based industries had been started in Bihar by foreign entrepreneurs. Bihar remained a part of the Bengal Presidency of British India until 1912, when Bihar and Orissa were carved out as separate provinces.

=== Pre- and post-Independence ===

Farmers in Champaran had revolted against indigo cultivation in 1914 (at Pipra) and 1916 (Turkaulia). In April 1917, Mahatma Gandhi visited Champaran, where Raj Kumar Shukla had drawn his attention to the exploitation of the peasants by European indigo planters. The Champaran Satyagraha that followed received support from many Bihari nationalists, such as Rajendra Prasad, Shri Krishna Sinha and Anugrah Narayan Sinha.

In the northern and central regions of Bihar, the Kisan Sabha (peasant movement) was an important consequence of the independence movement. It began in 1929 under the leadership of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati who formed the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha (BPKS), to mobilise peasant grievances against the zamindari attacks on their occupancy rights. The movement intensified and spread from Bihar across the rest of India, culminating in the formation of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) at the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress in April 1936, where Saraswati was elected as its first president.

Following independence, Bihari migrant workers have faced violence and prejudice in many parts of India, such as Maharashtra, Punjab, and Assam.

Decades following the independence in 1947 were full of violent conflicts between the landless section of Bihari society and the landed elite who controlled the government at various level. This was an outcome of the failed land reform drive and improper implementation of the land ceiling laws that were passed by Indian National Congress government in the 1950s. Landed castes like Rajput and Bhumihar became suspicious of the land reforms and used their influence in government to hinder the efforts of the land redistribution programme, which may have alleviated the huge caste based income inequalities. Unscrupulous tactics such as absentee landlordism neutralised the reforms which was architected by Krishna Ballabh Sahay.

In the Zamindari areas of Bihar, such as Bhojpur district, the Dalits were also subjected to frequent humiliation and practice of begar existed. This led to first spark of mass scale naxalism to grew up in the plains of Bhojpur. This armed struggle was led initially by Master Jagdish Mahto, a school teacher turned naxalite. Soon, the struggle spread into other parts of Bihar, where the landlords and agricultural labourers locked horns against each other. Between 1950 and 2000, several massacres took place. In Bihar, unlike the other parts of India, the naxalism took the form of caste conflict as the landed section of society belonged primarily to Forward Castes and a section of Upper Backward Castes, on the other hand, the landless were the people belonging to Schedule Castes and a section of Other Backward Castes. Formation of caste based private armies called &quot;senas&quot; took place in response to violent activities of the naxalites. One of the most dreaded caste army of the landlord was Ranvir Sena, which was involved in massacres of Dalits in Laxmanpur Bathe. The Dalit struggle against these caste armies was led by Indian People&#x27;s Front and its successor Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, which was controlled at the upper echelon by the middle peasant castes such as the Koeris and Yadavs, with Dalits and Extremely Backward Castes forming its mass support base and activists.

Meanwhile, the 1960s saw the rise of political instability in the state with dwindling power of Indian National Congress and rise of parties like Samyukta Socialist Party. The leaders belonging to Backward Castes became vocal for their political rights. The toppling of Mahamaya Prasad Sinha government by Jagdeo Prasad hastened the end of dominance of Forward Caste backed Indian National Congress in the state.

== Geography ==


Bihar covers a total area of , with an average elevation above sea level of . It is land locked by Nepal in the north, Jharkhand in the south West Bengal in the east and Uttar Pradesh to the west. It has three parts on the basis of physical and structural conditions: the Southern Plateau, the Shivalik Region, and Bihar&#x27;s Gangetic Plain. Furthermore, the vast stretch of the fertile Bihar Plain is divided by the Ganges River into two unequal parts – North Bihar and South Bihar. The Ganges flows west–east and, along with its tributaries, regularly floods parts of the Bihar plain. The main northern tributaries are the Gandak and Koshi, which originate in the Nepalese Himalayas, and the Bagmati, which originates in the Kathmandu Valley. Other tributaries are the Son, Budhi Gandak, Chandan, Orhani and Phalgu. Bihar has some small hills, such as the Rajgir hills in center, Kaimur Range in south-west and Shivalik Range in North. Bihar has a forest area of 6,764.14 km2, which is 7.1 per cent of its geographical area. The sub-Himalayan foothills of Shivalik ranges, primary Someshwar and Dun mountain, in West Champaran district are clad in a belt of moist deciduous forest. As well as trees, this consists of brush, grasses and reeds.

Bihar lies completely in the Subtropical region of the Temperate Zone, and its climatic type is humid subtropical. Its temperature is subtropical in general, with hot summers and cold winters. Bihar has an average daily high temperature of only 26 °C with a yearly average of 26 °C. The climate is very warm, but has only a very few tropical and humid months. Several months of the year it is warm to hot at temperatures continuously above 25 °C, sometimes up to 29 °C. Due to less rain the best time for travelling is from October to April. The rainiest days occur from May to September.

===Flora and fauna===

Bihar has a nature conservation area of , which is 7.27% of its geographical area. The sub-Himalayan foothill of Someshwar and the Dun ranges in the Champaran district have belts of moist deciduous forests, mixed with shrubs, grass and reeds. High rainfall (above 1,600 mm [63 in]) promotes forests of Sal (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;) in these areas. Other important trees are Sal Cedrela Toona, Khair, and Semal. Deciduous forests also occur in the Saharsa and Purnia districts, with common trees including &quot;Shorea robusta&quot; (), Diospyros melanoxylon (), &quot;Boswellia serrata&quot; (), &quot;Terminalia tomentose&quot; (), &quot;Terminalia bellerica&quot; (), &quot;Terminalia arjuna&quot; (), &quot;Pterocarpus marsupium&quot; (), and &quot;Madhuca indica&quot; ().

Valmiki National Park covers about of forest and is the 18th Tiger Reserve of India, ranked fourth in terms of the density of its tiger population. It has a diverse landscape and biodiversity in addition to sheltering protected carnivores. Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary in Bhagalpur region is a reserve for the endangered South Asian river dolphin. Other species in Bihar include leopard, bear, hyena, bison, chital and barking deer. Crocodilians including gharials and muggers as well as Gangetic turtles can be found in the river systems. Karkatgarh Waterfall on Karmanasa River is a natural habitat of the crocodilians. In 2016, the government of Bihar has accepted the proposal of the forest authorities to turn the area into a Crocodile Conservation Reserve (CCR). Other notable wildlife sanctuaries include Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary and Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary. Many varieties of local and migratory bird species can be seen in natural wetland of Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary, Asia&#x27;s largest oxbow lake and only Ramsar site in Bihar, and other notable wetlands of Baraila lake, Kusheshwar Nath Lake, Udaypur lake.

===Natural resource===
Bihar is the principal holder of the country&#x27;s pyrite reserves and possesses 95% of all known resources.

In May 2022, a gold mine was found in the district of Jamui. It accounts for more than 44% of the country&#x27;s gold reserve, approximately 223 million tons.

== Demographics ==



At the 2011 census, Bihar was the third most populous state of India with a total population of 104,099,452. It was also India&#x27;s most densely populated state, with 1,106 persons per square kilometre. The sex ratio was 1090 females per 1000 males in the year 2020. Almost 58% of Bihar&#x27;s population was below 25 years age, which is the highest in India. In 2021, Bihar has had an urbanisation rate of 20%. Bihar has an adult literacy rate of 68.15% (78.5% for males and 57.8% for females) in 2020. Population increased to 130,725,310 as per the Bihar caste survey conducted in 2023.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2023 census, 81.99% of Bihar&#x27;s population practised Hinduism, while 17.70% followed Islam. Christianity (0.05%), Buddhism (0.08%), and Sikhism (0.01%) are religious minorities in Bihar. Most of Bihar&#x27;s population belongs to Indo-Aryan-speaking ethnic groups. It also attracted Punjabi Hindu refugees during the Partition of British India in 1947.

Hindi is the official language of the state and is spoken natively by 25.54% of the total population. At 8.42%, Urdu is the second official language in 15 districts of the state. However, the majority of the people speak one of the Bihari languages, most of which were classified as dialects of Hindi during the census. The major ones are Bhojpuri (24.86%), Maithili (12.55%) and Magahi (10.87%) Angika and Bajjika, two other Bihari languages, are classified under other dialects of Hindi in the census. Maithili is a recognised regional language of India under the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India. Proponents have called for Bhojpuri, Magahi, Angika, and Bajjika to receive the same status. Smaller communities of Bengali and Surjapuri speakers are found in some parts of the state, especially in the eastern districts and urban areas.

== Government and administration ==


Under the Constitution of India, the Governor is the head of the government of Bihar, and is appointed by the President of India. The Chief minister is the executive head of the government who, with its cabinet ministers, makes all important policy decisions. The political party or coalition of political parties having a majority in the Bihar Legislative Assembly forms the government.

The Chief Secretary is the head of the bureaucracy of the state, under whom a hierarchy of officials is drawn from the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Forest Service, and different wings of the state civil services. The judiciary is headed by the Chief Justice of the High Court. Bihar has a high court in Patna, which has been functioning since 1916. All the branches of the government are located in the state capital, Patna.

The state is administratively divided into nine divisions and 38 districts. For the administration of urban areas, Bihar has 19 municipal corporations, 89 nagar parishads (city councils), and 154 nagar panchayats (town councils).

=== Politics ===

The politics of Bihar have been based on caste since the onset of Indian independence. The important castes with political presence and influence in Bihar includes: Yadav, Koeri, Kurmi, Rajput, Bhumihar, and Brahmin. Before 1990, politics was dominated by Forward Castes– Brahmin, Rajput, Bhumihar, and Kayastha. The numerous Other Backward Class group was only given a token representation in the government. This over representation of upper castes was due to their dominance in the Indian National Congress, which dominated the politics of the state for three decades after the independence of India. According to political scientist Sanjay Kumar: &quot;Using their dominant role in state&#x27;s government, in the period before 1990, the Forward Castes deliberately subverted the &#x27;land reforms&#x27;, which could have helped Backward Castes and the Scheduled Castes&quot;. The upper backwards relied on the political parties of Lok Dal and later Janata Dal for increasing their political representation. The year of 1989-90 saw the implementation of Mandal Commission&#x27;s recommendation by Vishwanath Pratap Singh&#x27;s government, which reserved 27% per cent seats in government jobs and educational institutions for the members of Other Backward Class. This event mobilised them against the &quot;politics of religion&quot; of the Bhartiya Janata Party, which was backed by the Forward Castes. Important figures such as Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar took a leading role in this mobilisation, and by 1990, the upper backwards– Koeri, Kurmi, Yadav became the new political elites of the state.

Historically, a caste troika consisting the three communities, Kushwaha, Kurmi and Yadav also led an anti-upper caste agitation in the state of Bihar, pushing them to the prominence in the state&#x27;s politics.

However, the tipping point of this Backward Caste unity came in 1995 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, when the dominant OBC castes, who were at the forefront in the collective struggle against the Forward Castes, were divided into two rival political camps. While one of these camps was led by Yadavs under Janata Dal, the other camp was led by Koeri and Kurmis, who assembled under the Samata Party. According to Sanjay Kumar, this was the election in which the caste divide in the state was most evident not between the Forward and Backward Castes, but rather between two groups of Backward Castes itself. It was this election from which the Forward Castes felt completely marginalised in Bihar&#x27;s electoral politics and from then onwards, no longer held any significant role in the state&#x27;s politics.

By 2004, &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine said that &quot;Bihar [had] become a byword for the worst of India, of widespread and inescapable poverty, of corrupt politicians indistinguishable from mafia-dons they patronise, caste-ridden social order that has retained the worst feudal cruelties&quot;. In 2005, the World Bank believed that issues faced by the state were &quot;enormous&quot; because of &quot;persistent poverty, complex social stratification, unsatisfactory infrastructure and weak governance&quot;.
 there are two main political formations: the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which comprises Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP); and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) between Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Hindustani Awam Morcha, Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, Janata Dal (United) (JDU) and Indian National Congress (INC). There are many other political formations. The Communist Party of India had a strong presence in Bihar at one time, which has since weakened. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI(M) and CPM and All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) have a minor presence, along with the other extreme leftist parties.

Nitish Kumar has been chief minister of Bihar for 13 years between 2005 and 2020. In contrast to prior governments, which emphasised divisions of caste and religion, his political platform was based on economic development, reduction of crime and corruption, and greater social equality. Since 2010, the government confiscated the properties of corrupt officials and redeveloped them into school buildings. They also introduced the Bihar Special Court Act to curb crime. It also legislated a two-hour lunch break on Fridays, to enable Muslim employees to pray and thereby reduce absenteeism. The government has prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol in the state since March 2016, which has been linked to a drop in tourism and a rise in substance abuse.

== Public health ==
Bihar generally ranks among the weakest in health outcomes in comparison to other Indian states because it lacks adequate health care facilities. While the National Health Mission, the Clinical Establishments Act of 2010, and the formation of the Empowered Action Group (EAG) provide federal funds to expand and improve healthcare services, Bihar&#x27;s ability to fully utilise this funding is lacking.

Research indicates that Bihar relies on privatised hospitals to provide healthcare to the masses, with the second-highest ratio among Indian states for private to public spending and high levels of corruption. These factors are associated with slower healthcare delivery and steep healthcare costs. Corruption is enabled as Bihar lacks continuity and transparency of health reporting as required by the Clinical Establishments Act of 2010. In turn, this prevents the government from making evidence-based conclusions about policy changes and hospital effectiveness, resulting in patterns of ill-informed spending and inconsistent hiring.

When comparing Bihar to Kerala, the number of healthcare professionals (including registered nurses, auxiliary nurses, physicians and health supervisors) at each hospital are significantly lower, and remain constant over time while they steadily increase in number in Kerala. According to Ministry of Health statistics, the greatest shortfalls are for physicians and specialists at 75%. Bihar has only 50% of the sub-health centres, 60% of the primary health centres, and 9% of the community health centres required by the national supply-to-population standards. The number of public hospital beds in Bihar decreased between 2008 and 2015. Given the high population density of the state, Bihar is significantly behind in the number of healthcare professionals that should be employed. Despite these shortcomings, Bihar has shown gradual signs of improvement for female health workers, the overall death rate, and infant, neo-natal, child and maternal mortality rates.

== Economy ==



Bihar&#x27;s gross state domestic product (GSDP) for the fiscal year (FY) 2013–14 was around  billion. By sectors, its composition is 22% agriculture, 5% industry and 73% services. Bihar has the fastest-growing state economy in terms of GSDP, with a growth rate of 17.06% in FY 2014–15. The economy of Bihar was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4% during 2012–2017 (the 12th Five-Year Plan). Bihar has experienced strong growth in per capita net state domestic product (NSDP). At current prices, per capita NSDP of the state grew at a CAGR of 12.91% from 2004 to 2005 to 2014–15. Bihar&#x27;s per capita income went up by 40.6% in FY 2014–15. The state&#x27;s debt was estimated at 77% of GDP by 2007.

=== Agriculture ===
Among the states of India, Bihar is the fourth-largest producer of vegetables and the eighth-largest producer of fruits. About 80% of the state&#x27;s population is employed in agriculture, which is above the national average. The main agricultural products are litchi, guava, mango, pineapple, brinjal, lady&#x27;s finger, cauliflower, cabbage, rice, wheat, sugarcane, and sunflower. Though good soil and favourable climatic conditions favour agriculture, this can be hampered by floods and soil erosion. The southern parts of the state endure annual droughts, which affect crops such as paddy.

=== Industry ===
Begusarai is the industrial and financial capital of Bihar. It has major industries like Barauni Refinery, NTPC, Barauni (BTPS), Barauni Fertiliser Plant (HURL, Barauni), Sudha Dairy Plant, Pepsi Bottling Plant.

Hajipur, Dalmianagar, Munger, Jamalpur and Barauni are the major industrial cities in Bihar The capital city, Patna, is one of the better-off cities in India when measured by per capita income.
Hajipur is also known for presence of private industries like Competence Exports, which gained international recognition in 2024, when it was reported to be catering to the demand of many European countries. In 2024, Hajipur was reported to become the exporter of designer shoes for European companies. It also exported shoes for Russian Army amidst their Ukrainian campaign.

The Finance Ministry has sought to create investment opportunities for big industrial houses like Reliance Industries. Further developments have taken place in the growth of small industries, improvements in IT infrastructure, a software park in Patna, Darbhanga, Bhagalpur, and the completion of the expressway from the Purvanchal border through Bihar to Jharkhand. In August 2008, a Patna-registered company called the Security and Intelligence Services took over the Australian guard and mobile patrol services business of American conglomerate, United Technologies Corporation (UTC). SIS is registered and taxed in Bihar.

Prior to prohibition, Bihar emerged as a brewery hub with numerous production units. In August 2018, United Breweries Limited announced it would begin production of non-alcoholic beer at its previously defunct brewery in Bihar.

=== Startup ===
The startup ecosystem in Bihar is rapidly evolving, fuelled by a combination of entrepreneurial zeal and proactive government initiatives. The Bihar Startup Policy 2022-2027 aims to make Bihar a preferred destination for startups and entrepreneurs by leveraging local youth for inclusive growth.

The policy offers various incentives, including interest-free seed funding up to ₹10 lakh, tax exemptions, and access to incubation centers. The government has established a Startup Bihar Fund Trust (SBFT) with an initial corpus of ₹500 crore to provide venture capital for startups. Key sectors witnessing significant growth include agritech, healthcare, edtech, and e-commerce. With a focus on skill development, mentorship, and ease of doing business, Bihar is steadily transforming into an emerging hub for startups, driving both economic growth and employment.

=== Income distribution ===
In terms of income, the districts of Patna, Munger, and Begusarai placed highest among the 38 districts in the state, recording the highest per capita gross district domestic product of 1,15,239, 42,793 and 45,497, respectively, in FY 2020-21.

Bihar also ranks very low in per capital income in comparison to other cities in India. Patna has per capital income of 1.15L, which is much lower than other cities like Gurugram (7.41L), Noida (6.13), Bengaluru (6.21L), Hyderabad (6.58L) and Mumbai (6.43).

===Income disparity among social groups===
Rumela Sen, a lecturer at Columbia University, outlines the inequalities and backwardness prevalent in Bihar in the post-independence period as a consequence of the &quot;delaying tactics&quot; against the implementation of land reform and utilisation of kinship ties by the upper-caste landlords, who had an obstructionist attitude towards land reform policies. The upper-caste not only dominated the administration, but also the politics in the post-independence period; they utilised their caste ties in order to prevent the distribution of about 9000 acres of land intended for the poor. Since the landlords primarily belonged to upper-castes, just like the politicians and administrators in the early decades after independence, they were successful in grabbing large holdings of land amidst the passage of the Zamindari abolition act of 1952.

== Culture ==
=== Paintings ===

There are several traditional styles of painting practised in Bihar. One is Mithila painting, a style used in the Mithila region of Bihar. Traditionally, this form was practised mainly by women, passed down generation to generation. Painting was usually done on walls during festivals, religious events, births, marriages, and other cultural milestones. It was traditionally done on the plastered walls of mud huts, and is also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas. Famous Mithila painters include Smt Bharti Dayal, Mahasundari Devi, the late Ganga Devi, and Sita Devi.

Mithila painting is also called Madhubani art. It mostly depicts human beings and their association with nature. Common scenes illustrate deities and Saraswati from ancient epics, celestial objects, and religious plants like Tulsi, and scenes from the royal court and social events. Generally, no space is left empty.

Bhojpuri painting is a folk painting style that has flourished in the Bhojpuri region of Bihar thousands of years ago. This painting style is a type of wall painting primarily done on temple walls or on walls of the rooms of newly married couples and the main motifs are that of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Although in recent times motifs of natural objects and life and struggles of village people are also depicted to make the painting more acceptable among the common people and bring the style close to reality.

The Patna School of Painting (&quot;Patna Kalam&quot;), sometimes called &quot;Company Painting&quot;, flourished in Bihar during the early 18th to mid-20th centuries. It was an offshoot of the Mughal Miniature School of Painting. Those who practised this art form were descendants of Hindu artisans of Mughal painting. Facing persecution from the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, these artisans found refuge, via Murshidabad, in Patna during the late 18th century. Their art shared the characteristics of the Mughal painters, expanded subject matter from court scenes to bazaar scenes, daily life and ceremonies. They used watercolours on paper and on mica. This school of painting formed the basis for the formation of the Patna Art School under the leadership of Shri Radha Mohan. The school is an important centre of the fine arts in Bihar.

=== Performing arts ===

Bihar has produced musicians like Bharat Ratna and Ustad Bismillah Khan, and dhrupad singers like the Malliks (Darbhanga Gharana) and the Mishras (Bettiah Gharana), along with poets like Vidyapati Thakur who contributed to the genre of Maithili music. The classical music in Bihar is a form of Hindustani classical music.

Gaya is another centre of classical music, particularly of the Tappa and Thumri varieties. Pandit Govardhan Mishra–son of the Ram Prasad Mishra, himself an accomplished singer– is perhaps the finest living exponent of Tappa singing in India, according to Padma Shri Gajendra Narayan Singh, founding secretary of the Sangeet Natak Academi of Bihar.

Gajendra Narayan Singh also writes, in his memoir, that Champanagar, Banaili, was another major centre of classical music. Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha of Champanagar, Banaili princely state, was a great patron of music and was himself a renowned figure in the world of classical vocal music in Bihar in his time. Singh, on the subject of Indian classical music in a separate book of his, wrote that &quot;Kumar Shyamanand Singh of Banaili estate had such expertise in singing that many great singers including Kesarbai Kerkar acknowledged his ability. After listening to bandishes from Kumar Sahib, Pandit Jasraj was moved to tears and lamented that, alas, he did not have such ability himself.&quot;

During the 19th century, many Biharis emigrated as indentured labourers to the West Indies, Fiji, and Mauritius. During this time many sorrowful plays and songs called &quot;birha&quot; became popular in the Bhojpur region, as &quot;Bhojpuri Birha&quot;. Dramas incorporating this theme continue to be popular in the theatres of Patna.

=== Cinema ===

Bihar has a robust Bhojpuri-language film industry. There is also a smaller production of Magadhi-, Maithili language films. The first film with Bhojpuri dialogue was &quot;Ganga Jamuna&quot;, released in 1961.
Bhaiyaa, the first Magadhi film, was released in 1961.
The first Maithili movie was &quot;Kanyadan&quot; released in 1965.
Maithili film &quot;Mithila Makhaan&quot; won the
National Film Award for Best Maithili Film in 2016.
The history of films entirely in Bhojpuri begins in 1962 with the well-received film &quot;Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo&quot; (&quot;Mother Ganges, I will offer you a yellow sari&quot;), which was directed by Kundan Kumar.
1963&#x27;s &quot;Lagi nahin chute ram&quot; was the all-time hit Bhojpuri film, and had higher attendance than &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; in the eastern and northern regions of India. Bollywood&#x27;s &quot;Nadiya Ke Paar&quot; is another well-known Bhojpuri-language movie. Films such as &quot;Bidesiya&quot; (&quot;Foreigner&quot;, 1963, directed by S. N. Tripathi) and &quot;Ganga&quot; (&quot;Ganges&quot;, 1965, directed by Kundan Kumar) were profitable and popular, but in general Bhojpuri films were not commonly produced in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the 1980s, enough Bhojpuri films were produced to support a dedicated industry. Films such as &quot;Mai&quot; (&quot;Mom&quot;, 1989, directed by Rajkumar Sharma) and &quot;Hamar Bhauji&quot; (&quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot;, 1983, directed by Kalpataru) had success at the box office. However, this trend faded during the 1990s.

In 2001, Bhojpuri films regained popularity with &quot;Saiyyan Hamar&quot; (&quot;My Sweetheart&quot;, directed by Mohan Prasad), which raised actor Ravi Kishan to prominence. Several other commercially successful films followed, including &quot;Panditji Batai Na Biyah Kab Hoi&quot; (&quot;Priest, tell me when I will marry&quot;, 2005, directed by Mohan Prasad) and &quot;Sasura Bada Paisa Wala&quot; (&quot;My father-in-law, the rich guy&quot;, 2005). These films did much better business in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than mainstream Bollywood hits at the time, and were both made on extremely tight budgets. &quot;Sasura Bada Paisa Wala&quot; also introduced Manoj Tiwari, formerly a well-loved folk singer, to the wider audiences of Bhojpuri cinema. The success of Ravi Kishan and Manoj Tiwari&#x27;s films led to a revival in Bhojpuri cinema, and the industry began to support an awards show and trade magazine &quot;Bhojpuri City&quot;. The industry produces over one hundred films per year.
In 2019, the Maithili film &quot;Mithila Makhaan&quot; won Best Maithili Film in the 63rd National Film Awards.

=== Mass media ===

&quot;Biharbandhu&quot; was the first Hindi newspaper published in Bihar. It was started in 1872 by Madan Mohan Bhatta, a Marathi Brahman who settled in Bihar Sharif. Hindi journalism often failed until it became an official language in the state. Hindi was introduced in the law courts in Bihar in 1880.

Urdu journalism and poetry have a long history in Bihar, with many poets such as Shaad Azimabadi, Kaif Azimabadi, Kalim Ajiz and Bismil Azimabadi. Bihar publishes many Urdu dailies, such as &quot;Qomi Tanzim&quot; and &quot;Sahara&quot;, and the monthly &quot;Voice of Bihar&quot;.

The beginning of the 20th century was marked by a number of notable new publications. A monthly magazine named &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot; was started in Patna, in 1901. It was followed by &quot;Ksahtriya Hitaishi&quot;, &quot;Aryavarta from Dinapure&quot;, &quot;Udyoga&quot;, and &quot;Chaitanya Chandrika&quot;. &quot;Udyog&quot; was edited by Vijyaanand Tripathy, a famous poet of the time, and &quot;Chaitanya Chandrika&quot; by Krishna Chaitanya Goswami, a literary figure of that time. The literary activity was not confined to Patna alone but to other districts of Bihar.

=== Festivals ===

Chhath Puja is the biggest and most popular festival in Bihar. The four-day-long holy Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state. Chhath Puja are done in various cities, towns, and villages throughout Bihar. All of Bihar involves itself in devotion to Chhath Puja. The city is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful ghats are set up, where effigies of the goddess Chhath Maiya and her brother God Surya are displayed and worshipped at both sunset and sunrise. People of all religious backgrounds go to the bank of any river or near by a pond or lake in order to give arghya to the Sun. They carry fruits and thekuaa along with them in soop and daura (a bowl-like structure made of bamboo) for their worship activities. Nowadays, these traditions have spread to multiple countries worldwide wherever Bihari community is present.

Durga Puja is also the biggest, most popular and widely celebrated festival in Bihar. The ten-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout Bihar. The cities of Bihar are transformed during Durga Puja. Urban areas are decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than that of a religious festival. Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities. On Vijayadashami, the last day of the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being immersed into the rivers.

The Ganges is navigable throughout the year, and was the principal river highway across the vast Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vessels capable of accommodating five hundred merchants were known to ply this river in the ancient period, when it served as a conduit for overseas trade. The role of the Ganges as a channel for trade was enhanced by its natural links to major rivers and streams in north and south Bihar.

== Education ==
 Historically, Bihar has been a major centre of learning, home to the ancient universities of Nalanda (est. 450 CE), Odantapurā (est. 550 CE), and Vikramashila (est. 783 CE). Nalanda and Vikramshila universities were destroyed by the invading forces of Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1200 CE. Bihar saw a revival of its education system during the later part of the British rule, when Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library was established in 1891 by Sir Khan Bahadur Khuda Bakhsh which is currently one of the world&#x27;s largest functioning library and boasts more than five million items. It is known for its paintings and rare manuscripts.

Patna University, the seventh oldest university on the Indian subcontinent, was established in 1917. Some other centres of high learning established under British rule are Patna College (est. 1839), Bihar School of Engineering (est. 1900; now known as National Institute of Technology, Patna), Prince of Wales Medical College (est. 1925; now Patna Medical College and Hospital), Science College, Patna (est. 1928), Patna Women&#x27;s College, Bihar Veterinary College (est. 1927), and Imperial Agriculture Research Institute (est. 1905; now Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University, Pusa). The Patna University, one of the oldest universities in Bihar, was established in 1917, and is the seventh oldest university of the Indian subcontinent. NIT Patna, the second oldest engineering college of India, was established as a survey training school in 1886 and later renamed as the Bihar College of Engineering in 1932.

Today, Bihar is home to eight Institutes of National Importance: IIT Patna, IIM Bodh Gaya, AIIMS, Patna, NIT Patna, IIIT Bhagalpur, NIPER Hajipur, Khuda bakhsh Oriental Library, and the Nalanda International University. In 2008, Indian Institutes of Technology Patna was inaugurated with students from all over India and in the same year the National Institute of Fashion Technology Patna was established as the ninth such institute in India. The Indian Institute of Management Bodh Gaya was established in 2015. In March 2019, the government of Bihar sent a proposal to the centre government to upgrade Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital into an AIIMS-like institution. Bihar is home of four Central universities which includes Central University of South Bihar, Mahatma Gandhi Central University, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University and Nalanda University. In 2015, the central government proposed the re-establishment of Vikramshila in Bhagalpur and had designated 500 crores (5 billion) for it. Bihar also has the National Institute of Fashion Technology Patna, National Law University, Patna Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Footwear Design and Development Institute, Bihta and Central Institute of Plastic Engineering &amp; Technology (CIPET) Center. CIPET and IHM was established in Hajipur in 1994 and 1998 respectively. Bihar Engineering University was established under Bihar Engineering &quot;University Act, 2021 of&quot; Bihar Government with the purpose of the development and management of educational infrastructure related to technical, medical, management, and related professional education in Bihar. Based on 2020–21 data, Bihar Engineering University has 56 and Bihar medical science University under the Bihar medical science University act, 2021. There are Pharmacy colleges, 15 Medical colleges, and 36 Nursing colleges after establishing this university. Aryabhatta Knowledge University has 33 educational colleges, 8 community colleges, and one vocational college. Chanakya National Law University and Chandragupt Institute of Management were established in the later half of 2008 and now attracts students from not just within Bihar but also students from far flung states. Nalanda International University was established in 2014 with active investment from countries such as Japan, Korea, and China. The A.N. Sinha Institute of Social Studies is a premier research institute in the state. Bihar has eight medical colleges which are funded by the government, namely Patna Medical College and Hospital, Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Vardhman Institute of Medical Sciences, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital Gaya, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Bhagalpur, Government Medical College, Bettiah and five private medical colleges Bihar has the seven oldest Government Engineering colleges; Muzaffarpur institute of technology, Bhagalpur college of Engineering, Gaya college of Engineering, Nalanda College of Engineering, Darbhanga college of Engineering, Motihari college of Engineering, and the Loknayak Jai Prakash Institute of Technology.

Bihta, a suburb of the state capital Patna, is home of institutes like IIT Patna, AIIMS Patna, BIT Patna and is now emerging as an educational hub. With institutes like Super 30, Patna has emerged as a major center for engineering and civil services coaching. The major private IIT-JEE coaching institutes have opened up their branches in Bihar and this has reduced the number of students who go to, for example, Kota and Delhi for engineering/medical coaching.

Bihar e-Governance Services &amp; Technologies (BeST) and the government of Bihar have initiated a unique program to establish a centre of excellence called Bihar Knowledge Center, a school to equip students with the latest skills and customised short-term training programs at an affordable cost. The centre aims to attract the youth of the state to improve their technical, professional, and soft skills, to meet the current requirements of the industrial job market. The National Employability Report of Engineering Graduates, 2014, puts graduates from Bihar in the top 25 per cent of the country, and rates Bihar as one of the three top states at producing engineering graduates in terms of quality and employability.

<text>The Churches of God (Seventh Day) is composed of a number of sabbath-keeping churches, among which the General Conference of the Church of God, or simply CoG7, is the best-known organization. The Churches of God (Seventh Day) observe the Sabbath on Saturday, the seventh day of the week.

==History==
The Church of God (Seventh Day) represents a line of Sabbatarian Adventists that rejected the visions and teachings of Ellen G. White before the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1863. Robert Coulter, ex-president and official historian of the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day), in his book &quot;The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)&quot; (2014) credits (1814–1903) of Michigan as being the founder of the church. Cranmer was a Christian Connection minister and a biblical Unitarian. He was introduced to Sabbath keeping in 1852 by Joseph Bates, known as the founder and developer of Sabbatarian Adventism. In 1858, five years before the founding of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a group led by Cranmer separated from the Adventists who supported James Springer White and Ellen G. White. Another independent Sabbatarian Adventist body formed in Iowa in 1860, and joined with the Church of God (Seventh Day) in 1863. A publication called &quot;The Hope of Israel&quot; (now &quot;The Bible Advocate&quot;) was started in 1863, and this publication extended the influence of the body into other areas. Through this publication, the doctrines of the second advent and the seventh-day Sabbath were promoted, and other Christians were invited to gather for meetings. This extended the movement into Missouri, Nebraska and other places, and in 1884 the General Conference of the Church of God was organized. They incorporated in 1899, and &quot;(Seventh Day)&quot; was added to the name in 1923. Offices were established in Stanberry, Missouri. A. N. Dugger and C. O. Dodd (1935) wrote a book attempting to trace the Church&#x27;s history back to the Apostles through various medieval groups that they believed were Sabbath-keeping. In the case of some of these groups, such as the Waldensians and Paulicians, that claim is disputed. A well-publicized member of the church was evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong (1893–1986). In 1927 Armstrong was challenged by his wife, Loma, to find a biblical justification for keeping Sunday as the Christian Sabbath. Loma had come under the influence of Emma Runcorn, a member of the Seventh Day church in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Runcorn and her husband Ora were lay leaders in the Oregon conference. Armstrong soon became a minister for that church and a writer for the &quot;Bible Advocate&quot; journal. Within a few years, Armstrong began teaching the British-Israel Theory – the alternative history that regarded the nations of Western Europe and North America as the literal descendants of the &quot;Lost Ten Tribes&quot; of Israel – and the mandatory keeping of the Feast Days and Holy Days as listed in Leviticus 23. Armstrong disassociated himself from the Church of God (7th Day) - Salem Conference over these two issues, which were not original doctrines of the Churches of God (7th Day); years later, Church of God (7th Day) revoked his ministerial credentials with their Church, but by this time he was well-established in his own church, the Radio Church of God.

===The division of 1933===
The following information concerning the division of 1933 is taken from an online history book, &quot;History of the Seventh Day Church of God&quot;, by Richard C. Nickels. The Church of God (Seventh Day) was unified up until 1933. According to A. N. Dugger a Church of God historian, and leader of one of the factions at the time, many in the Church of God felt the need for a &quot;Bible Organization&quot; for the Church of God. They also wanted to move the church&#x27;s world headquarters to Jerusalem. They held a conference in Salem, West Virginia, on November 4, 1933. Pressure was mounting for more unity from roughly half of the membership. While others felt that they were being denied freedom of expression. Dugger and his followers wanted a reorganization of church doctrine. Including clean meats, no tobacco, and observing the Passover on Nisan 14. While Burt F. Marrs led a group of &quot;independents&quot; who believed pork and tobacco were fine, and that the Passover should be observed on Nisan 15. At this point, Dugger and his followers decided to establish the Salem Conference headquarters in Salem, West Virginia, at which point they started printing the &quot;Bible Advocate&quot;. As a result, from 1933 to 1949 there were two separate Church of God organizations, one at Stanberry, Missouri, and the other at Salem, West Virginia. The headquarters in Salem still exists today with members worldwide. They are formally organized under the apostolic model (twelve apostles, seventy elders and seven men to oversee the business affairs of the church). Shortly afterwards, Dugger left the Salem Conference.

===1940s reunification===
The following information concerning the reunification in the 1940s is taken from &quot;History of the Seventh Day Church of God&quot; by Richard C. Nickels. The first attempt for a merger between the Stanberry and Salem Conferences occurred in 1942. A copyright lawsuit concerning the &quot;Bible Advocate&quot; magazine and the publication of the &quot;Bible Home Instructor&quot; hindered the merger. In 1947, the Salem Council of Ministers asked Stanberry to appoint a committee to meet with their committee to discuss a new attempt for a merger. The two churches met at Fairview, Oklahoma, on February 12–17, 1948. Because of the laws under which the Stanberry group was incorporated, the earliest possible time the union of the two groups could take place was August 1949. The merger was voted on August 12–20, 1949, and the first issue of the combined &quot;Bible Advocate&quot; came out on October 3, 1949. Charles Monroe, who wrote &quot;A Synoptic History of the Churches of God in the Latter Days&quot;, (Facts of Our Faith, January, 1969, pages 12–25) related, &quot;the merger did not unite all of the Church of God.&quot;

===&quot;Back to Salem&quot; movement===
The following information concerning the &quot;Back to Salem&quot; Movement of 1950 are taken from &quot;History of the Seventh Day Church of God&quot; by Richard C. Nickels. As early as 1949, ministers F. L. Summers and his son-in-law Chris Royer went back to Salem and established a headquarters there. The &quot;Back to Salem&quot; movement broke into at least three factions: 1. The original Salem people who stayed at Salem with it as headquarters; 2. Dugger and Severson, who went to Jerusalem; and 3. Olson and Groshans, who formed the Seventh Day Church of God in Caldwell, Idaho. The Salem Conference started to publish a magazine, &quot;The Advocate of Truth&quot;, in February 1950. Salem is purported to believe that the saints will be raptured to the sea of glass while the seven last plagues will be poured out. It differs with the Denver Group in the date for the annual Lord&#x27;s Supper, which they calculate according to the spring equinox. In September 1952, Dugger, after returning from an extended trip to Nigeria to visit Church of God groups, decided to move to Jerusalem to start &quot;The Mount Zion Reporter&quot; in 1953. Possibly doctrinal issues led to Dugger&#x27;s exit to Israel. The 1948/49 Stanberry-Salem Merger of the Church of God (Seventh Day), also known as the Denver Group, contains the largest number of Church of God people today, but it is not the only significant Church of God center. The Stanberry conference, with headquarters moved to Denver, Colorado, typically uses the name General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day), with &quot;Seventh&quot; spelled out. A number of Churches of God (7th Day) in Salem, West Virginia still stand with locations all across the United States and around the world. These usually follow a set of 40 points of doctrine.

==Doctrine and practices==
This section mainly uses the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day) [Denver Conference] Statement of Faith as a reference. Although the doctrinal beliefs among the General Council Churches of God, (Seventh-Day), Inc. in Meridian, Idaho and different Churches of God (7th Day) or (Seventh Day) are very similar, some major points of disagreement still remain, either concerning christological beliefs or church organization. Outlining some beliefs of the Churches of God (7th Day), the Statement of Faith of the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day) - Denver Conference states the following:
* Christology has been a long debated issue in the Churches of God (7th Day). Cranmer, the founder of the Church of God (Seventh Day), left the Methodist Church to join the Christian Connection &quot;over the doctrine of the Trinity&quot;. Cranmer was a biblical Unitarian [an Ebionist]. He did not believe Jesus preexisted his birth and he &quot;believed the Father alone is God.&quot; Today, according to the Denver Conference, God is revealed in Scripture as Father and Son. From eternity the Son existed with Father and shared His glory (Section 2). This christological belief is a departure from their long-held doctrinal beliefs in that regard. The Denver Conference, part of the greatest Church of God (7th Day) movement, had an Arian christology for much of the twentieth century, before leaving part of their heritage and reverting to a more classical view of Christ. &quot;Nota bene&quot;: The Salem Conference, the Churches previously affiliated or linked to the Jerusalem Conference and a number of independent Churches of God (7th Day) still believe that Jesus Christ, as the Word of God, is a created being. Some independent churches or individuals retain a biblical Unitarian [Arian] christology. A position paper written by the Jerusalem Conference states the following:

*According to the Denver Conference, salvation is by God&#x27;s grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ apart from good works, human merit, or ceremony (Section 4). Obedience to the moral law, while not a means to salvation, is encouraged as an important part of Christian living. Eating of unclean meats such as pork and shellfish is discouraged, as is the observance of Christmas and Easter, due to their pagan roots (Section 10). The Salem Conference and churches associated with the Jerusalem Conference strongly discourage the use of tobacco, alcohol and any other drugs as well. Furthermore, according to the Salem Conference, &quot;There are three basic precepts that we must follow in order to obtain salvation and receive the gift of eternal life&quot; : 1) To love the LORD your God; 2) to accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior, repent of our sins, and become baptized in the name of the &quot;Lord Jesus Christ&quot;; and 3) to continually strive for a better understanding of God&#x27;s truth. According to this same Conference, &quot;The key point here is that in order to be approved unto God, we must study his word. Our salvation depends upon it.&quot;.
*Mankind is mortal, and the soul is unconscious in death (Section 3). The wicked who reject Christ until the end will face the judgment of annihilation, not eternal torment in hellfire (Section 12).
*Two church ordinances are observed—baptism by immersion and an annual Lord&#x27;s supper service (with washing of feet), observed annually on the day of Jesus&#x27;s death, Nisan 14 (Section 6).
*On tithing, the Denver Conference differs from the Salem Conference and the churches associated with the Jerusalem headquarters. The Salem and Jerusalem Churches of God (7th Day) still believe tithing to be an obligation for believers today. According to the Salem Conference: &quot;All members of God&#x27;s church are required to contribute a tenth part of their increase to the work of the church&quot;, a statement to which the Jerusalem Churches and other churches more or less related to that conference agree as stated in their 40 Points of Doctrine that reads: &quot;The paying of tithes on all increase is a continued obligation. This portion of our earnings belongs to יהוה, and should be placed in his work. Malachi 3:10; Matthew 23:23&quot;.
*All three groups object to military service and participation in physical warfare. The Salem and Jerusalem Conferences have a stronger stance on the question, condemning participation in &quot;carnal warfare&quot; rather than simply discouraging it.
* A peculiarity, the Church of God (7th Day) - Salem Conference is organized according to the &quot;apostolic model.&quot; They currently have twelve apostles, seventy prophets and seven stewards. This belief may be found on page 13 of their doctrinal statement of beliefs. An article for their FAQs section states:

* Still another group, with headquarters located in Meridian, Idaho, object to the hierarchical form of church governance found in the Denver Conference and in the Salem Conference. This group, the General Council of the Churches of God (Seventh Day) Inc., favors a congregationalist polity for the Church. According to them:

*The Jerusalem Conference still believe that headcovering is mandatory for women in public worship.

==Membership==
As of 2010, the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day) has 233 congregations in the United States and Canada, with an estimated 14,000 members. As for the Denver Conference, the worldwide membership in its International Ministerial Congress is over 200,000 members, with affiliated ministries in more than 40 countries. Central offices for the US and Canada local churches are in Denver as of 2015, with Elder Loren Stacy serving as president. The Denver Conference is a member of the Bible Sabbath Association (org. 1943), an organization promoting &quot;fellowship and cooperation between Sabbath-keepers of various groups.&quot; The Salem conference has members in South Africa.

<doc id="442490" wikidata="Q872073" url="?curid=442490" title="David Kilgour">
<text>David William Kilgour (February 18, 1941 – April 5, 2022) was a Canadian human rights activist, author, lawyer, and politician. He was also a Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.

Kilgour graduated from the University of Manitoba in economics in 1962 and the University of Toronto law school in 1966. From crown attorney in northern Alberta to Canadian Cabinet minister, Kilgour ended his 27-year tenure in the House of Commons of Canada as an Independent MP. Upon retirement, he was one of the longest serving members of parliament and one of few who had been elected under both the Progressive Conservative and Liberal banners.

==Member of Parliament==
Kilgour was originally elected as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1979. He first sought election in 1968 in the riding of Vancouver Centre as a Progressive Conservative. He did not run again until the 1979 election, in Edmonton; he won a seat this time and went on to serve as a member of parliament for about 27 years. In April 1990, he was expelled from the Tory national caucus after criticizing the Mulroney government&#x27;s policies. He sat as an independent for several months before joining the Liberals.

In the Liberal government, he served as the Deputy Speaker (1993–1997) and Chairman of Committees of the Whole of the House of Commons, Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa) (1997–2002), and Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific) (2002–2003). In the Conservative governments of Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Privy Council, the Minister for CIDA, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, and the Minister of Transport.

As a Secretary of State, Kilgour was continuously vocal on many human rights violations around the world. In 2001 while visiting Zimbabwe, Kilgour was vocally critical of Mugabe&#x27;s farm-invasions policy and pushed for increasing international pressure. In December 2004, he was among the Ukrainian election monitor delegation of the federal run-off elections.

In April 2005, he received media attention when he speculated about quitting the Liberal Party because of his disgust with the sponsorship scandal, saying that the issue made Canada look like &quot;a northern banana republic&quot;. On April 12, 2005, he announced that he would sit as an independent MP. He also cited Canada&#x27;s lack of action on the crisis in Darfur, Sudan, as reasons for quitting. He asserted that he has no plans to move back to the Conservatives, and stated that he had no plans to run for re-election.

From 1979 to 1988, he represented the riding of Edmonton—Strathcona, but with shifting constituency lines moved to the Edmonton Southeast in 1988, and then again to Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont in 2004, which he represented until he retired from politics at the 2006 election.

Because of the unusual structure of the 38th House of Commons, in May 2005, David Kilgour&#x27;s lone vote had the power to bring down or support the government. He used this influence to urge the Martin government to send peacekeepers to Darfur. He was an endorser of the Genocide Intervention Network. Then-Prime Minister Paul Martin agreed to send humanitarian support but in the end, no peacekeepers were sent.

===Electoral history===
==Democracy activism==
While being a lifelong practicing Christian, Kilgour worked on issues such as inter-faith dialog, personal freedoms, and democratic government throughout his career. In Parliament, he was active in prayer groups while at venues and publications across the country he has spoken specifically on religious themes and politics. Commonly, his topics have been on global religious and political persecutions. He served as a fellow of the Queen&#x27;s University Centre for the Study of Democracy; a director of the Washington-based Council for a Community of Democracies (CCD), and co-chair of the Canadian Friends of a Democratic Iran, and has hosted an Iran pro-democracy rally attended by approximately 90,000 in France in 2009.

His personal religious beliefs landed him in the news in 2003 when he abstained from the same-sex marriage bill and was reprimanded by then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

==Organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China==

In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China&#x27;s organ transplant industry. With David Matas he released the Kilgour-Matas report, which stated &quot;the source of 41,500 transplants for the six-year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained&quot; and &quot;we believe that there have been and continue today to be large-scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners&quot;. In 2009, they published an updated version of the report as a book. They traveled to about 50 countries to raise awareness of the situation.

In 2012, &quot;State Organs: Transplant Abuse in China&quot;, edited by David Matas and Dr. Torsten Trey, was published with essays from six medical professionals, Ethan Gutmann, David Matas and an essay co-written by Kilgour. Ethan Gutmann interviewed over 100 witnesses and estimated that 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008.

==Personal life and death==
Kilgour was married to Laura Scott, with whom he had five children. He died on April 5, 2022, in Ottawa at the age of 81, from lung disease.

In May 2006, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity (D.D.(Hon)) degree from Knox College, University of Toronto. Kilgour, a Presbyterian, was recognized for his commitment to human rights in Canada and abroad and particularly his challenge to the international community to respond to the plight of Darfur, as well as in Burma, and Zimbabwe.
For their organ harvesting work, Matas and Kilgour won the 2009 Human Rights Award from the German-based International Society for Human Rights and were nominated for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.

==Relations==
He is the brother of Geills Turner, widow of former Canadian Prime Minister John Turner. Kilgour and his sister are the great nephew and niece of John McCrae, the soldier and poet who wrote &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, and also the great nephew and niece of John Wentworth Russell, who painted the portrait of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, which hangs in the House of Commons.

<doc id="442494" wikidata="Q156831" url="?curid=442494" title="Tilia platyphyllos">
<text>Tilia platyphyllos, the large-leaved lime or large-leaved linden, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae (Tiliaceae). It is a deciduous tree, native to much of continental Europe as well as southwestern Great Britain, growing on lime-rich soils. The common names largeleaf linden and large-leaved linden are in standard use throughout the English-speaking world except in the British Isles, where it is known as large-leaved lime. The name &quot;lime&quot;, possibly a corruption of &quot;line&quot; originally from &quot;lind&quot;, has been in use for centuries and also attaches to other species of &quot;Tilia&quot;. It is not, however, closely related to the lime fruit tree, a species of citrus.

The specific epithet &quot;platyphyllos&quot; (greek: πλατύφυλλος) means in greek &quot;with broad leaves&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot; is a narrowly domed tree with a moderate growth rate, and can eventually attain a height of . The reddish-brown young stems later develop dark grey bark with fine fissures and furrows. The branches spread upwards at wide angles. The twigs are reddish-green and slightly pubescent. The foliage consists of simple, alternately arranged leaves. As indicated by its common name, this tree has larger leaves than the related &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; (small-leaved lime), 6 to 9 cm (exceptionally 15 cm). They are ovate to cordate, mid to dark green above and below, with white downy hair on the underside, particularly along the veins, tapering into a mucronate tip. The margin is sharply serrate, and the base cordate; the venation is pinnate along a midrib. The pubescent petiole is usually 3–4 cm long, but can vary between 1.5–5 cm. The autumn foliage is yellow-green to yellow.

The small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers are arranged in drooping, cymose clusters in groups of 3 to 4. Their whitish-green, leaf-like bracts have an oblong-obovate shape. The geniculate peduncles are between 1.5–3 cm long. The hermaphroditic flowers have 5 sepals and 5 tepals, numerous stamens, but no staminodes. The superior ovary is 2–10 locular with one smooth style. The flowers are pollinated by bees and some butterflies, notably the White-letter Hairstreak. The fruit is a fat, round, tomentose, cream-colored nutlet with a diameter of 1 cm or less. It has a woody shell with 3–5 ridges.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot; is widely planted throughout the temperate world as an ornamental tree in parks and city streets. Numerous cultivars are available, including &#x27;Aurea&#x27;, (golden leafed), &#x27;Fastigiata&#x27;, &#x27;Laciniata&#x27; (seemingly torn leaves), &#x27;Örebro&#x27; (columnar), &#x27;Princes Street&#x27; (narrow crown), &#x27;Rubra&#x27; (red twigged), &#x27;Tortuosa&#x27; (twisted branches), and &#x27;Tiltstone Filigree&#x27; (upswept branches).

The cultivar &#x27;Rubra&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Hybrids==
&quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot; readily hybridizes with &quot;Tilia cordata&quot;, the hybrid being the common lime &quot;T.&quot; × &quot;europaea&quot; (syn. &quot;T.&quot; × &quot;vulgaris&quot;).

==Fossil record==
Fossils of &quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot; have been described from the fossil flora of Kızılcahamam district in Turkey, which is of early Pliocene age.

==Use==
&quot;Tilia&quot; wood is used for carving, and almost all parts of the tree can be used for fodder, ropes or firewood. Bast and honey, which were historically the main products of &quot;Tilia&quot;, may have been an important factor in the spread of the species and its status as a typical agroforestry tree in the Middle Ages. &quot;Tilia spp&quot;. are also important for amenity use, shelterbelts and game plantings in the open landscape, in urban areas and recreational forestry.

===Traditional medicine===
The plant also contains tannins that can act as an astringent. The wood is burned to charcoal and ingested for intestinal disorders and used topically for edema or infection, such as cellulitis or of the lower leg.

<text>Teresa Heinz (born Maria Teresa Thierstein Simões-Ferreira; October 5, 1938), also known as Teresa Heinz Kerry, is a Portuguese-American businesswoman and philanthropist. Heinz is the widow of former U.S. Senator John Heinz and the current wife of former United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, longtime U.S. Senator, and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Heinz has served as chair of the Heinz Endowments and the Heinz Family Philanthropies.

==Early life==
Maria Teresa Thierstein Simões-Ferreira was born in the city of Lourenço Marques (later renamed Maputo) in the east African colony of Portuguese Mozambique, which later became the nation of Mozambique. Her parents were José Simões-Ferreira Jr., a Portuguese-born oncologist and tropical disease specialist, and Irene Thierstein, a Portuguese and British national. Irene Thierstein&#x27;s father was the scion of a Swiss-German family living in Malta, and her mother was the half-French, half-Italian daughter of an Alexandrian shipowner who traded with Russia during the Crimean War; both emigrated to Portuguese East Africa. Simões-Ferreira was raised Roman Catholic.

In 1960, Simões-Ferreira earned a Bachelor of Arts in Romance Languages and Literature from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. In 1963, she graduated from the School of Translation and Interpretation at the University of Geneva; after her graduation, she moved to the United States to be an interpreter at the United Nations.

==Marriages, children, and personal life==
On February 5, 1966, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&#x27;s gothic Heinz Chapel on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, Simões-Ferreira married future U.S. Senator John Heinz, an heir to the H. J. Heinz Company. The couple had three sons: H.John IV, André, and Christopher. In 1971, Teresa Heinz became a naturalized United States citizen. John Heinz died in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Teresa Heinz inherited a fortune from her husband upon his death.

In 1990, Teresa Heinz met Senator John Kerry at an Earth Day rally. This was the only reported time the two met before John Heinz&#x27;s death. In 1992, Teresa Heinz met Kerry again, this time at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Heinz was a member of a State Department delegation appointed by then-President George H. W. Bush. Heinz and Kerry were married May 26, 1995, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. 

Following her marriage to Kerry, Heinz retained the name Teresa Heinz. In May 2004, she said: 
My legal name is still Teresa Heinz. Teresa Heinz Kerry is my name... for politics. Just so people don&#x27;t ask me questions about so and so is so and so&#x27;s wife or this and that. Teresa Heinz is what I&#x27;ve been all my growing-up life, adult life, more than any other name. And it&#x27;s the name of my boys, you know ?... So, that&#x27;s my legal name and that&#x27;s my office name, my Pittsburgh name.

In addition to Portuguese (her native language), Heinz speaks English, Spanish, French, and Italian. She is Roman Catholic.

===Health===
In December 2009, Heinz revealed that she was being treated for breast cancer. Heinz indicated that she had undergone several lumpectomies and would be following up with a targeted type of radiation therapy treatment called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).

On July 7, 2013, Heinz was taken by ambulance to Nantucket Cottage Hospital after showing symptoms consistent with a seizure. She was described as being in &quot;critical but stable&quot; condition. Heinz was then flown to Massachusetts General Hospital for further medical treatment and tests. Her condition was upgraded to fair the next day, and doctors were able to rule out a heart attack, brain tumor, stroke, and other triggers. On July 11, she was transferred to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital to continue her recovery. Heinz was released on July 17, 2013, from Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. She recovered at home after some limited out-patient treatment.

==Philanthropy==

Heinz has served as chair of the Heinz Endowments and the Heinz Family Philanthropies, disbursing money to various social and environmental causes. She assists the City of Pittsburgh, where the Heinz family has many financial and family connections. In recognition of her philanthropy and activism, Heinz has received honorary doctoral degrees from the following institutions:
* Bank Street College of Education
* Beloit College
* Carlow University
* Carnegie Mellon University
* Clark University
* Drexel University
* Kenyon College
* Medical College of Pennsylvania
* Pine Manor College
* University of Massachusetts Boston
* University of Massachusetts Dartmouth
* Washington &amp; Jefferson College
* University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg

In 2003, Heinz was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Gold Medal for Humanitarianism. She has been elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She has been a Trustee of the St. Paul&#x27;s School (Concord, New Hampshire), which Kerry attended.

Heinz is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

===Environmental programs and advocacy===
Heinz has contributed to the environmental movement through many programs and outreach efforts. In 1990, she co-founded the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning (later known as the Alliance for Healthy Homes, it has since merged with the National Center for Healthy Housing), through the first environmental grant of the Vira I. Heinz Endowment. In 1992, she was a Delegate to the Earth Summit, representing Non-Governmental Organizations.

In 1993, with Kerry and environmentalist academic Dr. Anthony Cortese, she co-founded Second Nature, which brings &quot;Education for Sustainability&quot; to college campuses. In 1993, she founded the Heinz Awards, including a category for Outstanding Contributions to the Environment. In 1995, with a $20 million grant, the Heinz Endowments provided initial funding for The Heinz Center, &quot;a nonprofit institution dedicated to improving the scientific and economic foundation for environmental policy through multisectoral collaboration among industry, government, academia, and environmental organizations.&quot;

Since 1996, Heinz has hosted an annual &quot;Women&#x27;s Health and the Environment&quot; conference series. She founded Teresa Heinz Scholars for Environmental Research, which annually awards eight $10,000 awards for doctoral dissertation support and eight $5,000 awards for Masters&#x27; thesis support for research having &quot;public policy relevance that increases society&#x27;s understanding of environmental concerns and proposed solutions.&quot; Heinz is a board member of the Environmental Defense Fund.

===Women&#x27;s economic security programs and advocacy===
In 1995, the book &quot;Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future&quot; (later republished as &quot;The Pension Book&quot;) was published, with support from the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Foundation, and a foreword by Heinz.

Spurred by the issues uncovered by &quot;Pensions in Crisis&quot;, Heinz and her foundation created the Women&#x27;s Retirement Initiative to &quot;extend that investigation and examine how the dynamics of our pension and retirement system contribute to the disproportionate rate of poverty among older women.&quot;

In 1996, the Heinz Foundations created WISER, the Women&#x27;s Institute for a Secure Retirement.

==Wealth==
Heinz is estimated to be worth between $750 million and $1.2 billion. In 2017 Heinz and Kerry listed an ocean-front home on Nantucket for sale at $25 million.

==Politics==
Like her first husband, Heinz was a registered Republican for most of her voting life, and she remained a registered Republican despite being married to Kerry. In January 2003, she changed her registration to the Democratic Party.

In 2003, Heinz was named to the PoliticsPA list of &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s Most Politically Powerful Women&quot;.

Heinz is said to have been encouraged to run for her first husband&#x27;s vacant Senate seat after his death. Heinz declined and refused to endorse Republican Congressman Rick Santorum&#x27;s 1994 bid for the seat. She publicly denounced him as the &quot;antithesis&quot; of her late husband, and later called him &quot;Forrest Gump with attitude.&quot; It was rumored she would challenge Santorum in 2006 (as a Democrat), but she did not enter the race, and the Democratic nomination went to State Treasurer Bob Casey Jr., who went on to defeat Santorum.

In a 2004 interview, Heinz criticized George W. Bush&#x27;s Iraq War policy, stating, &quot;Our first priority was terrorism. We have now made enemies of people who were our friends, and even our allies distrust us. And that&#x27;s a terrible thing.&quot;

Heinz has a reputation in the media as a very direct personality. In an interview published in &quot;USA Today&quot; in July 2004, Heinz was asked about the differences between then-First Lady Laura Bush and herself:

&quot;Well, you know, I don&#x27;t know Laura Bush. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don&#x27;t know that she&#x27;s ever had a real job — I mean, since she&#x27;s been grown up. So her experience and her validation comes from important things, but different things. And I&#x27;m older, and my validation of what I do and what I believe and my experience is a little bit bigger — because I&#x27;m older, and I&#x27;ve had different experiences. And it&#x27;s not a criticism of her. It&#x27;s just, you know, what life is about.&quot;

Heinz retracted the statement later, saying she was &quot;sincerely sorry&quot; for the remark. &quot;I had forgotten that Mrs. Bush had worked as a schoolteacher and librarian, and there couldn&#x27;t be a more important job than teaching our children&quot;, Heinz said. &quot;As someone who has been both a full time mom and full time in the workforce, I know we all have valuable experiences that shape who we are. I appreciate and honor Mrs. Bush&#x27;s service to the country as first lady, and am sincerely sorry I had not remembered her important work in the past.&quot;

Bush brushed it off, saying, &quot;It didn&#x27;t matter to me. It didn&#x27;t hurt my feelings. It was perfectly all right that she apologized. She didn&#x27;t have to apologize. I know how tough it is. And actually I know those trick questions.&quot;

<doc id="442503" wikidata="Q460244" url="?curid=442503" title="Duke of Normandy">
<text>In the Middle Ages, the duke of Normandy was the ruler of the Duchy of Normandy in north-western France. The duchy arose out of a grant of land to the Viking leader Rollo by the French king Charles the Simple in 911. In 924 and again in 933, Normandy was expanded by royal grant. Rollo&#x27;s male-line descendants continued to rule it until 1135, and cognatic descendants ruled it until 1204. In 1202 the French king Philip II declared Normandy a forfeited fief and by 1204 his army had conquered it. It remained a French royal province thereafter, still called the Duchy of Normandy, but only occasionally granted to a duke of the royal house as an appanage.

Despite both the 13th century loss of mainland Normandy, the renunciation of the title by Henry III of England in the Treaty of Paris (1259), and the extinction of the duchy itself in modern-day, republican France, in the Channel Islands the monarch of the United Kingdom is regardless still often informally referred to by the title &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;. This is the title used whether the monarch is a king or a queen.

==History of the title==
There is no record of Rollo holding or using any title. His son and grandson, Duke William I and Duke Richard I, used the titles &quot;count&quot; (Latin &quot;comes&quot; or &quot;consul&quot;) and &quot;prince&quot; (&quot;princeps&quot;). Prior to 1066, the most common title of the ruler of Normandy was &quot;Count of Normandy&quot; (&quot;comes Normanniae&quot;) or &quot;Count of the Normans&quot; (&quot;comes Normannorum&quot;). The title Count of Rouen (&quot;comes Rotomagensis&quot;) was never used in any official document, but it was used of William I and his son by the anonymous author of a lament (&quot;planctus&quot;) on his death. Defying Norman pretensions to the ducal title, Adhemar de Chabannes was still referring to the Norman ruler as &quot;Count of Rouen&quot; as late as the 1020s. In the 12th century, the Icelandic historian Ari Thorgilsson in his &quot;Landnámabók&quot; referred to Rollo as &quot;Ruðu jarl&quot; (earl of Rouen), the only attested form in Old Norse, although too late to be evidence for 10th-century practice. The late 11th-century Norman historian William of Poitiers used the title &quot;Count of Rouen&quot; for the Norman rulers down to Richard II. According to David C. Douglas, the title &quot;Count of Rouen&quot; (comes Rotomagensis) was never used in any official document. Charters are usually a source of information about titles, but none exist for Normandy in the middle of the tenth century.

The first official recorded use of the title duke (&quot;dux&quot;) is in an act in favour of the Abbey of Fécamp in 1006 by Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Earlier, the writer Richer of Reims had called Richard I a &quot;dux pyratorum&quot;, but which only means &quot;leader of pirates&quot; and was not a title. During the reign of Richard II, the French king&#x27;s chancery began to call the Norman ruler &quot;Duke of the Normans&quot; (&quot;dux Normannorum&quot;) for the first time. As late as the reign of Duke William II (1035–87), the ruler of Normandy could style himself &quot;prince and duke, count of Normandy&quot; as if unsure what his title should be. The literal Latin equivalent of &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;, &quot;dux Normanniae&quot;, was in use by 1066, but it did not supplant &quot;dux Normannorum&quot; until the Angevin period (1144–1204), at a time when Norman identity was fading.

Richard I experimented with the title &quot;marquis&quot; (&quot;marchio&quot;) as early as 966, when it was also used in a diploma of King Lothair. Richard II occasionally used it, but he seems to have preferred the title duke. It is his preference for the ducal title in his own charters that has led historians to believe that it was the chosen title of the Norman rulers. Certainly it was not granted to them by the French king. In the twelfth century, the Abbey of Fécamp spread the legend that it had been granted to Richard II by Pope Benedict VIII (ruled 1012–24). The French chancery did not regularly employ it until after 1204, when the duchy had been seized by the crown and Normandy lost its autonomy and its native rulers.

The actual reason for the adoption of a higher title than that of count was that the rulers of Normandy began to grant the comital title to members of their own family. The creation of Norman counts subject to the ruler of Normandy necessitated the latter taking a higher title. The same process was at work in other principalities of France in the eleventh century, as the comital title came into wider use and thus depreciated. The Normans nevertheless kept the title of count for the ducal family and no non-family member was granted a county until Helias of Saint-Saëns was made Count of Arques by Henry I in 1106.

From 1066, when William II conquered England, becoming King William I, the title Duke of Normandy was often held by the King of England. In 1087, William died and the title passed to his eldest son, Robert Curthose, while his second surviving son, William Rufus, inherited England. In 1096, Robert mortgaged Normandy to William, who was succeeded by another brother, Henry I, in 1100. In 1106, Henry conquered Normandy. It remained with the King of England down to 1144, when, during the civil war known as the Anarchy, it was conquered by Geoffrey Plantagenet, the Count of Anjou. Geoffrey&#x27;s son, Henry II, inherited Normandy (1150) and then England (1154), reuniting the two titles. In 1202, King Philip II of France, as feudal suzerain, declared Normandy forfeit and by 1204 his armies had conquered it. Henry III finally renounced the English claim in the Treaty of Paris (1259).

Thereafter, the duchy formed an integral part of the French royal demesne. The kings of the House of Valois started a tradition of granting the title to their heirs apparent. The title was granted four times (1332, 1350, 1465, 1785) between the French conquest of Normandy and the dissolution of the French monarchy in 1792. The French Revolution brought an end to the Duchy of Normandy as a political entity, by then a province of France, and it was replaced by several &quot;départements&quot;.

In 1204, the King of France confiscated the Duchy of Normandy (with only the Channel Islands remaining under English control) and subsumed it into the crown lands of France. Thereafter, the ducal title was held by several French princes.

In 1332, King Philip VI gave the Duchy in appanage to his son John, who became king John II of France in 1350. He in turn gave the Duchy in appanage to his son Charles, who became king Charles V of France in 1364. In 1465, Louis XI, under constraint, gave the Duchy to his brother Charles de Valois, Duke of Berry. Charles was unable to hold the Duchy and in 1466 it was again subsumed into the crown lands and remained a permanent part of them. The title was conferred on a few junior members of the French royal family before the abolition of the French monarchy in 1792.

* John (son of King Philip VI, later King John II of France), 1332–1350.
* Charles (son of John II of France, later King Charles V of France), 1350–1364
* Charles (brother of Louis XI of France, also Duke of Berry), 1465–1466
* James, Duke of York, later King James II of England. On 31 December 1660, a few months after the restoration of Charles II to the thrones of England and Scotland, King Louis XIV proclaimed Charles&#x27;s younger brother, James, Duke of York, &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;. This was probably done as a political gesture of support.
* Louis-Charles (son of Louis XVI, later Dauphin 1789–1791 and titular King Louis XVII 1792–1795), 1785–1792.

==Modern usage==
In the Channel Islands, the British monarch is known informally as the &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;, irrespective of whether or not the holder is male (Queen Elizabeth II, for instance, was known by this title). The Channel Islands are the last remaining part of the former Duchy of Normandy to remain under the rule of the British monarch. Although the English monarchy relinquished claims to continental Normandy and other French claims in 1259 (in the Treaty of Paris), the Channel Islands (except for Chausey under French sovereignty) remain Crown dependencies of the British throne.

The British historian Ben Pimlott noted that while Queen Elizabeth II was on a visit to mainland Normandy in May 1967, French locals began to doff their hats and shout &quot;Vive la Duchesse!&quot;, to which the Queen supposedly replied &quot;Well, I &quot;am&quot; the Duke of Normandy!&quot;

However, the king is customarily referred to as &quot;The Duke of Normandy&quot;, the title used by the islanders, especially during their loyal toast, where they say, &quot;The Duke of Normandy, our King&quot;, or &quot;The King, our Duke&quot;, &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Rouai, nouotre Duc&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Roué, note Du&quot; in Norman (Jèrriais and Guernésiais respectively), or &quot;Le Roi, notre Duc&quot;&quot; in Standard French, rather than simply &quot;The King&quot;, as is the practice in the United Kingdom.

The title &#x27;Duke of Normandy&#x27; is not used in formal government publications, and, as a matter of Channel Islands law, does not exist.

==Statue==
A statue of the first seven dukes was erected in Falaise in Normandy in the 19th century. It depicts William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy and later King of England, on a horse, and is surrounded by statues of his six predecessors.

<doc id="442504" wikidata="Q1635462" url="?curid=442504" title="Wario Land II">
<text>Wario Land II is a 1998 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. The player controls Wario as he attempts to recover his treasure from Captain Syrup. The gameplay is similar to its predecessor; players navigate Wario through a series of platforming levels with the goal of getting to the end of the game with as many coins as possible. &quot;Wario Land II&quot; introduces an invulnerability gameplay mechanic, which allows Wario to get hit by enemies without taking damage and instead causes the reaction of either a loss of coins or, depending on the enemy, a new form that Wario takes which allows the player to access previously inaccessible areas. 

Wario Land II has received overwhelmingly positive critical reception, with praise for the game&#x27;s large levels, secrets and gameplay mechanics. The Game Boy Color version was released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2012.

==Gameplay==

Unlike in most video games of the time, the game&#x27;s challenge comes mostly through impeding player progress by implementing physical obstacles, puzzle-solving or paths blocked by coin or treasure locks, or forcing Wario back to previously-visited areas. By finding hidden exits in some stages, the player can change the direction of the game&#x27;s plot and uncover different endings, as well as find more treasure. In addition to the Really Final Chapter, five other endings can be unlocked by collecting all the treasures. An enemy-themed Simon Says minigame based on the Game &amp; Watch game Flagman can be unlocked by collecting all the picture tiles. Wario does not have any life points and cannot die; some enemy attacks simply knock him backward and cause him to drop some coins. He can take advantage of certain enemy attacks however to undergo transformations which allow him to reach areas that he cannot normally get to. For example, exposure to fire makes Wario run around and later become entirely engulfed by flames, which allows him to defeat enemies on contact. In contrast to its predecessor, the game does not have a time limit, which allows the player to explore the areas in unlimited time, a feature which is incorporated in subsequent installments.

==Plot==
Following the second-best ending in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, early one morning, Captain Syrup and a few of her soldiers, the Pirate Gooms, sneak into Wario&#x27;s castle and cause havoc. They steal all his precious treasure, set off his giant alarm clock, and leave the tap running, flooding much of his castle. After Wario wakes up and figures out what&#x27;s going on, he gives chase across the surrounding lands.

At the end of the game, Captain Syrup is defeated and Wario regains his treasure, how much of which depending on how the player played the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Wario Land II&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, with their four reviewers praising its vast size, numerous secrets, and varied gameplay. Dan Hsu especially enjoyed how the player character cannot die, only suffer a variety of comic misfortunes which can sometimes allow him to access secret areas, and remarked that &quot;&quot;Wario Land II&quot; reminds me of so many old-school platformers, yet it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve seen before.&quot;

The Game Boy Color version held an aggregate score of 88.04% at GameRankings based on 14 reviews. &quot;IGN&quot; insisted that &quot;It&#x27;s the perfect game to accompany you on a long road trip because of its lastability and replayability.&quot; &quot;Allgame&quot; considered it a disappointment that it offered no improvements over the original Game Boy version apart from the addition of color, but said the game still held up at the time of its Game Boy Color release due to the well-thought-out puzzle elements and consistently outstanding platforming.

&quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, reviewing the Virtual Console re-release, argued that &quot;Big fans of the first game might lament Wario Land II&#x27;s sudden significant change in gameplay, but if you give it a try, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s actually quite good.&quot; In 2019, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; included Wario Land II on their &quot;The 10 Best Game Boy Games&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="442505" wikidata="Q29291" url="?curid=442505" title="Particle in a spherically symmetric potential">
<text>In quantum mechanics, a spherically symmetric potential is a system of which the potential only depends on the radial distance from the spherical center and a location in space. A particle in a spherically symmetric potential will behave accordingly to said potential and can therefore be used as an approximation, for example, of the electron in a hydrogen atom or of the formation of chemical bonds.

In the general time-independent case, the dynamics of a particle in a spherically symmetric potential are governed by a Hamiltonian of the following form:formula_1
Here, formula_2 is the mass of the particle, formula_3 is the momentum operator, and the potential formula_4 depends only on the vector magnitude of the position vector, that is, the radial distance from the origin (hence the spherical symmetry of the problem). 

To describe a particle in a spherically symmetric system, it is convenient to use spherical coordinates; denoted by formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the system is then a separable, partial differential equation. This means solutions to the angular dimensions of the equation can be found independently of the radial dimension. This leaves an ordinary differential equation in terms only of the radius, formula_5, which determines the eigenstates for the particular potential, formula_4.

==Structure of the eigenfunctions==
If solved by separation of variables, the eigenstates of the system will have the form:formula_10
in which the spherical angles formula_11 and formula_12 represent the polar and azimuthal angle, respectively. Those two factors of formula_13 are often grouped together as spherical harmonics, so that the eigenfunctions take the form:
formula_14

The differential equation which characterises the function formula_15 is called the radial equation.

==Derivation of the radial equation==
The kinetic energy operator in spherical polar coordinates is:formula_16The spherical harmonics satisfyformula_17
Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation we get a one-dimensional eigenvalue equation,formula_18This equation can be reduced to an equivalent 1-D Schrödinger equation by substituting formula_19, where formula_20 satisfiesformula_21which is precisely the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with an effective potential given byformula_22where formula_23. The correction to the potential &quot;V&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is called the centrifugal barrier term.

If formula_24, then near the origin, formula_25.

== Spherically symmetric Hamiltonians ==
Since the Hamiltonian is spherically symmetric, it is said to be invariant under rotation, ie:

formula_26

Since angular momentum operators are generators of rotation, applying the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Lemma we get: 

formula_27

Since this equation holds for all values of formula_11, we get that formula_29, or that every angular momentum component commutes with the Hamiltonian. 

Since formula_30 and formula_31 are such mutually commuting operators that also commute with the Hamiltonian, the wavefunctions can be expressed as formula_32 or formula_33 where formula_34 is used to label different wavefunctions. 

Since formula_35 also commutes with the Hamiltonian, the energy eigenvalues in such cases are always independent of formula_36. 

formula_37

Combined with the fact that formula_38 differential operators only act on the functions of formula_11 and formula_12, it shows that if the solutions are assumed to be separable as formula_41, the radial wavefunction formula_15 can always be chosen independent of formula_43 values. Thus the wavefunction is expressed as:

formula_44

==Solutions for potentials of interest==
There are five cases of special importance:
#formula_45, or solving the vacuum in the basis of spherical harmonics, which serves as the basis for other cases.
#formula_46 (finite) for formula_47 and zero elsewhere.
# formula_45 for formula_49 and infinite elsewhere, the spherical equivalent of the square well, useful to describe bound states in a nucleus or quantum dot.
#formula_50for the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.
#formula_51 to describe bound states of hydrogen-like atoms.

The solutions are outlined in these cases, which should be compared to their counterparts in cartesian coordinates, cf. particle in a box.

===Vacuum case states===
Let us now consider formula_45. Introducing the dimensionless variablesformula_53the equation becomes a Bessel equation for formula_54:formula_55where regular solutions for positive energies are given by so-called &quot;Bessel functions of the first kind&quot; formula_56 so that the solutions written for formula_15 are the so-called &quot;spherical Bessel function&quot;

formula_58.

The solutions of the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates in vacuum are thus labelled by three quantum numbers: discrete indices &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; varying continuously in formula_59:formula_60These solutions represent states of definite angular momentum, rather than of definite (linear) momentum, which are provided by plane waves formula_61.

===Sphere with finite &quot;square&quot; potential===
Consider the potential formula_46 for formula_47 and formula_64 elsewhere - that is, inside a sphere of radius formula_65 the potential is equal to formula_66 and it is zero outside the sphere. A potential with such a finite discontinuity is called a &quot;square potential.&quot;

We first consider bound states, i.e. states which display the particle mostly inside the box (confined states). Those have an energy formula_67 less than the potential outside the sphere, i.e., they have negative energy. Also worth noticing is that unlike Coulomb potential, featuring an infinite number of discrete bound states, the spherical square well has only a finite (if any) number because of its finite range.

The resolution essentially follows that of the vacuum case above with normalization of the total wavefunction added, solving two Schrödinger equations — inside and outside the sphere — of the previous kind, i.e., with constant potential. The following constraints must hold for a normalizable, physical wavefunction:

#The wavefunction must be regular at the origin.
#The wavefunction and its derivative must be continuous at the potential discontinuity.
#The wavefunction must converge at infinity.

The first constraint comes from the fact that Neumann and Hankel functions are singular at the origin. The physical requirement that formula_13 must be defined everywhere selected Bessel function of the first kind over the other possibilities in the vacuum case. For the same reason, the solution will be of this kind inside the sphere:formula_69Note that for bound states, formula_70. Bound states bring the novelty as compared to the vacuum case now that formula_71. This, along with the third constraint, selects the Hankel function of the first kind as the only converging solution at infinity (the singularity at the origin of these functions does not matter since we are now outside the sphere):formula_72The second constraint on continuity of formula_13 at formula_74 along with normalization allows the determination of constants formula_75 and formula_76. Continuity of the derivative (or logarithmic derivative for convenience) requires quantization of energy.

===Sphere with infinite &quot;square&quot; potential===
In case where the potential well is infinitely deep, so that we can take formula_77 inside the sphere and formula_78 outside, the problem becomes that of matching the wavefunction inside the sphere (the spherical Bessel functions) with identically zero wavefunction outside the sphere. Allowed energies are those for which the radial wavefunction vanishes at the boundary. Thus, we use the zeros of the spherical Bessel functions to find the energy spectrum and wavefunctions. Calling formula_79 the &quot;k&quot;th zero of formula_80, we have:formula_81so that the problem is reduced to the computations of these zeros formula_79, typically by using a table or calculator, as these zeros are not solvable for the general case.

In the special case formula_83 (spherical symmetric orbitals), the spherical Bessel function is formula_84, which zeros can be easily given as formula_85. Their energy eigenvalues are thus:
formula_86

===3D isotropic harmonic oscillator===
The potential of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is
formula_87
An &quot;N&quot;-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator has the energies
formula_88
i.e., formula_89 is a non-negative integral number; formula_90 is the (same) fundamental frequency of the formula_91 modes of the oscillator. In this case formula_92, so that the radial Schrödinger equation becomes,
formula_93

Introducing
formula_94
and recalling that formula_95, we will show that the radial Schrödinger equation has the normalized solution,
formula_96
where the function formula_97 is a generalized Laguerre polynomial in formula_98 of order formula_99.

The normalization constant formula_100 is,
formula_101

The eigenfunction formula_102 is associated with energy formula_103, where
formula_104
This is the same result as the quantum harmonic oscillator, with formula_105.

====Derivation====
First we transform the radial equation by a few successive substitutions to the generalized Laguerre differential equation, which has known solutions: the generalized Laguerre functions. Then we normalize the generalized Laguerre functions to unity. This normalization is with the usual volume element .

First we scale the radial coordinate
formula_106
and then the equation becomes
formula_107
with formula_108.

Consideration of the limiting behavior of at the origin and at infinity suggests the following substitution for ,
formula_109
This substitution transforms the differential equation to
formula_110
where we divided through with formula_111, which can be done so long as &quot;y&quot; is not zero.

=====Transformation to Laguerre polynomials=====
If the substitution formula_112 is used, formula_113, and the differential operators become
formula_114 and
formula_115

The expression between the square brackets multiplying formula_116 becomes the differential equation characterizing the generalized Laguerre equation (see also Kummer&#x27;s equation):
formula_117
with formula_118.

Provided formula_119 is a non-negative integral number, the solutions of this equations are generalized (associated) Laguerre polynomials
formula_120

From the conditions on formula_99 follows: (i) formula_122 and (ii) formula_89 and formula_124 are either both odd or both even. This leads to the condition on formula_124 given above.

=====Recovery of the normalized radial wavefunction=====
Remembering that formula_95, we get the normalized radial solution:
formula_127

The normalization condition for the radial wave function is:
formula_128

Substituting formula_129, gives formula_130 and the equation becomes:
formula_131

By making use of the orthogonality properties of the generalized Laguerre polynomials, this equation simplifies to:
formula_132

Hence, the normalization constant can be expressed as:
formula_133

Other forms of the normalization constant can be derived by using properties of the gamma function, while noting that formula_89 and formula_124 are both of the same parity. This means that formula_136 is always even, so that the gamma function becomes:
formula_137
where we used the definition of the double factorial. Hence, the normalization constant is also given by:
formula_138

===Hydrogen-like atoms===

A hydrogenic (hydrogen-like) atom is a two-particle system consisting of a nucleus and an electron. The two particles interact through the potential given by Coulomb&#x27;s law:
formula_139
where
* &quot;ε&quot;0 is the permittivity of the vacuum,
* &quot;Z&quot; is the atomic number (&quot;eZ&quot; is the charge of the nucleus),
* &quot;e&quot; is the elementary charge (charge of the electron),
* &quot;r&quot; is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.

In order to simplify the Schrödinger equation, we introduce the following constants that define the atomic unit of energy and length:

formula_140

where formula_141 is the reduced mass in the formula_142 limit. Substitute formula_143 and formula_144 into the radial Schrödinger equation given above. This gives an equation in which all natural constants are hidden,
formula_145
Two classes of solutions of this equation exist: 

(i) formula_146 is negative, the corresponding eigenfunctions are square-integrable and the values of formula_146 are quantized (discrete spectrum).

(ii) formula_146 is non-negative, every real non-negative value of formula_146 is physically allowed (continuous spectrum), the corresponding eigenfunctions are non-square integrable. Considering only class (i) solutions restricts the solutions to wavefunctions which are bound states, in contrast to the class (ii) solutions that are known as &quot;scattering states&quot;.

For class (i) solutions with negative &quot;W&quot; the quantity formula_150 is real and positive. The scaling of formula_151, i.e., substitution of formula_152 gives the Schrödinger equation:
formula_153

For formula_154 the inverse powers of &quot;x&quot; are negligible and the normalizable (and therefore, physical) solution for large formula_155 is formula_156. Similarly, for formula_157 the inverse square power dominates and the physical solution for small formula_155 is &quot;x&quot;&quot;ℓ&quot;+1. 
Hence, to obtain a full range solution we substitute
formula_159

The equation for formula_160 becomes,
formula_161

Provided formula_162 is a non-negative integer, this equation has polynomial solutions written as
formula_163
which are generalized Laguerre polynomials of order formula_164. The energy becomesformula_165

The principal quantum number formula_166 satisfies formula_167. Since formula_168, the total radial wavefunction is
formula_169
with normalization which absorbs extra terms from formula_170
formula_171
via

formula_172

The corresponding energy is
formula_173

<doc id="442507" wikidata="Q4148040" url="?curid=442507" title="Earl of Kellie">
<text>The title Earl of Kellie or Kelly is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created in 1619 for Sir Thomas Erskine, who was Captain of the Guard and Groom of the Stool for James VI. It is named after Barony of Kellie in Fife, Scotland. Since 1875, it has been held jointly with the Earldom of Mar (1565 creation).

The family seat is Hilton Farm, near Alloa, Clackmannanshire.

==History==
The Earldom of Kellie was united with the Earldom of Mar in 1835, when the 26th Earl of Mar became also the 11th Earl of Kellie. At the death of that Earl in 1866, the Earldom of Kellie and the family&#x27;s estates passed to Walter Erskine, the cousin of the late Earl, and his heir-male. Meanwhile, it was assumed that the Earldom of Mar passed to John Francis Goodeve, the late Earl&#x27;s nephew, and his heir-general. Goodeve changed his name to Goodeve Erskine; his claim was agreed upon by most individuals. He even participated in the election of Scottish representative peers for the Peerage of Scotland.

However, the Earl of Kellie submitted a petition to the House of Lords asking that the Earldom of Mar be declared his, dying before it could be considered. His son, the 13th Earl of Kellie, renewed the petition, and the Lords decided the matter in 1875, determining that the Earldom of Mar properly belonged to the Earl of Kellie. However, due to a sentiment that the Lords had decided wrongly, the &quot;Earldom of Mar Restitution Act&quot; was passed. That Act declared that there were &quot;two&quot; Earldoms of Mar — one that would belong to the Earl of Kellie, and another that would belong to John Goodeve Erskine.

The subsidiary titles belonging to the Earl of Mar and Kellie are: &quot;Viscount of Fentoun&quot; or Fenton (created 1606), &quot;Lord Erskine&quot; (1429) and &quot;Lord Erskine of Dirleton&quot; (1603), the former of which is used as a courtesy title for the eldest son and heir of the Earl. Both titles are in the Peerage of Scotland. The Earl is Hereditary Keeper of Stirling Castle.

The family seat was Kellie Castle, near Pittenweem, Fife.

<text>Wario Land 3 is a 2000 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. The game&#x27;s plot centers around Wario who must free a mysterious figure who is trapped inside a music box.

The game was later re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2013, and as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service on February 8, 2023.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in &quot;Wario Land 3&quot; is very similar to that of its predecessor, &quot;Wario Land II&quot;. Wario must take advantage of his enemies&#x27; attacks to physically change and access new areas. For example, if Wario eats a donut thrown by a certain enemy, he temporarily bulks up to twice his size, giving him extra protection against attacks and the ability to break certain blocks. While Wario will always be affected by his enemies, he must also find new powers and abilities in order to progress through the game.

The world of the music box is divided into four different areas, East, West, North, and South, with a total of 25 individual stages spread between them. Each stage contains four treasures, for a total of 100, each of which is locked in a colored treasure chest that can only be opened with the corresponding key. The colors of the chests are, in the approximate order that they are intended to be opened, Gray, Red, Green, and Blue. This order is not fixed, although the game provides hints as to the next stage to travel to and the next treasure to obtain. Often, when a treasure chest in one stage cannot be reached, Wario must backtrack to retrieve a new item to make it accessible.

Finding new treasures usually opens a path to a new stage, or unlocks a new area in a previous stage. Some treasures grant Wario a new ability, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas. Whenever Wario obtains a new treasure, he is transported back to the music box overworld. Time alternates between day or night each time Wario exits a stage. Some stages change depending on the time of day; certain enemies may be replaced or different paths may open up. Wario cannot control time initially, but gains this ability when he finds a certain treasure.

In some stages, Wario will have to play a golfing minigame to progress. He must knock the enemy into the cup without going over par for that hole, while avoiding hazards such as water, bunkers, lava and rough. Upon collecting certain treasures in the game, this golf minigame is available to be played at any time from the overworld map.

Coins can be found in each stage, and are used primarily to play the golfing minigame described above. Wario can carry a maximum of 999 coins. In addition, eight Music Coins are hidden in each level for Wario to find. If all eight are found in each of the 25 stages, an extra fourth golf hole will be available for play.

As in the previous Wario Land game, Wario has no health points and cannot die; the lone exception is that he can get captured by the game&#x27;s final boss, Rudy the Clown and get a game over. This simply returns Wario back to the music box overworld.

==Plot==
One day, Wario&#x27;s plane stalls and crashes while he is flying over the woods. Uninjured, he spends the rest of his afternoon wandering amongst the trees and underbrush until he stumbles upon a mysterious cave. Inside the cave, he discovers a magical music box and is suddenly sucked into it. There, a mysterious figure informs Wario that he had once ruled the world inside the music box, until an evil being sealed away his magical powers in five music boxes. In exchange for freeing it, the being promises to send Wario back to his own world and let him keep any treasure he finds. Enticed by the thought of returning to his own world with a cache of treasure, Wario departs on his quest, in search of the music boxes and the many treasures of this mysterious land.

After collecting all the music boxes, Wario returns to the mysterious being&#x27;s temple. The music boxes play a medley together that frees the being, revealed to be Rudy the Clown. It transpires that Rudy is in fact the villain and had been imprisoned, although not before turning the music box&#x27;s inhabitants into monsters, who had been attacking Wario simply to try to stop him from freeing the evil clown. After Wario defeats Rudy, he is met by the inhabitants of the music box, now restored to their former selves. They thank Wario and transport him back to his own world, along with the treasure that he has collected, as promised.

==Reception==
&quot;Wario Land 3&quot; received highly positive reviews upon release. It has an aggregate score of 90.00% on GameRankings based on 15 reviews, making it the highest rated game in the &quot;Wario&quot; series. It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Game Boy Color Game&quot; and &quot;Best Platform Game&quot; awards, losing to &quot;Dragon Warrior I &amp; II&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, respectively.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; rated the game 9.8 out of 10, while &quot;IGN&quot; gave it an &quot;outstanding&quot; rating of 9 out of 10. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed it as the ninth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, describing it as the pinnacle of titular character Wario&#x27;s early action-platform adventure games. &quot;Nintendojo&quot; awarded the game a perfect 10 out of 10 and called it one of the best platforming games for Game Boy system.

It was the tenth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 255,536 copies sold.

==Legacy==
Rudy the Clown and several of &quot;Wario Land 3&quot;&#x27;s enemies return as antagonists and playable characters in &quot;Dr. Mario 64&quot; (2001). In the game&#x27;s Story Mode, Rudy sends his henchman Mad Scienstein to steal Dr. Mario&#x27;s Megavitamins, which can cure all forms of illness, to treat his cold, with Dr. Mario and Wario pursuing Mad Scienstein (and facing other &quot;Wario Land 3&quot; enemies in the process) to get them back.

<text>Wario Land 4 is a 2001 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It is the fourth installment in the &quot;Wario Land&quot; subseries of the &quot;Wario&quot; series. It was released in Japan in August 2001 and November 2001 internationally. In the game, Wario has to gather four treasures to unlock a pyramid and save Princess Shokora from the Golden Diva. The game received critical acclaim for its graphics and gameplay.

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay of &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; (which is generally similar to that of &quot;Wario Land II&quot; and &quot;Wario Land 3&quot;) allows for some open-endedness as well as some order of difficulty. After an Entry Passage that serves as a tutorial for the game, there are four main passages: the Emerald, Ruby, Topaz, and Sapphire Passages. The Emerald Passage is themed around nature. The Ruby Passage is themed around mechanics and technology. The Topaz Passage is themed around toys, games, and other &quot;playtime&quot; ideas. The Sapphire Passage is themed around horror and danger, prominently involving ghosts and the like. Every passage contains four levels and culminates in a boss fight. After these four main passages is the &quot;Final&quot; Golden Pyramid, which serves as a recap of these four themes and houses the Golden Passage level and the final boss.

Each level contains four jewel pieces, found in boxes scattered throughout, that need to be collected. Finding all jewel pieces within a passage unlocks access to the boss. The player must also find a creature called a Keyzer, which will unlock the door to the next level. The player can also collect treasure that increases their score in the form of coins that are dropped by enemies and floating crystals.

Wario begins every level by jumping through a Vortex that then closes behind him. It can only be reopened by finding a Switch located somewhere in the level. When the Switch is pressed, a timer will appear, forcing the player to get back to the beginning as quickly as possible. If the timer finishes counting down, the player&#x27;s score will begin to rapidly deplete, resulting in Wario being kicked from the stage and losing all collectables if it reaches zero. Switches can also make certain blocks appear or disappear, often making the player take a completely different path to the Vortex.

Unlike previous entries, Wario now has a health meter that depletes when he takes damage. If Wario loses all health, the player must start the level over, losing all collectables they had found.

Every Passage ends with a boss, which must be defeated within a time limit. Players can optionally use medals gained from playing minigames to buy an item that deals damage to the boss before the fight begins.

== Plot ==
Wario is reading the newspaper when he notices an article about a mysterious pyramid found deep in the jungle. The legend related to the pyramid is that of Princess Shokora, ruler of the pyramid, who was cursed by the money-crazed Golden Diva. As he enters it, he finds a black cat and chases it. Doing so, he falls down a precipice and is stuck inside the pyramid.

Exploring the pyramid, Wario has to fight several bosses, each of whom is in possession of items Princess Shokora once wore. After completing these passages, Wario gains access to the innermost part of the pyramid, which ends up being the stronghold of the Golden Diva. Wario meets the cat again, who turns out to be Princess Shokora herself. Wario defeats the Golden Diva and exits the pyramid with all the treasure he has acquired.

Upon their escape, Shokora is restored to her true form—this may be a brattish child, a female version of Wario, a Peach-like princess, and, ultimately, a superheroine-like princess (what form Shokora is restored to depends on the total number of treasure chests Wario had acquired from the other bosses prior as well as how quickly the Golden Diva is defeated—if he took too long to defeat any of them, some of these chests will be withheld). Shokora gives Wario a kiss on the cheek and ascends to the sky as Wario watches. After she leaves, Wario grabs his loot and celebrates by going to an all-you-can-eat steak buffet.

== Re-releases ==
The game was included in the list of Game Boy Advance games that were available for download by the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program since December 16, 2011.

The game has been re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014: in Japan on April 30, in North America on May 8, and in Europe and Australia on June 5.

The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on February 14, 2025.

== Reception ==
In the United States, &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; sold 720,000 copies and earned $20 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 33rd highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country. The game ended up selling 2.2 million copies worldwide.

The game received critical acclaim. &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; a 9 out of 10, or &quot;Outstanding&quot;, citing its well thought out level design and replayability. &quot;GamePro&quot; stated &quot;Boasting fantastic graphics and awesome transparency effects for water and fog, &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; pushes the GBA to its visual limits&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented &quot;The gameplay is tight and varied, the graphics are detailed and bright, and the sound is second to none&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; called the game: &quot;An incredibly entertaining, diverse, and humorous addition to the Mario/Wario legacy. It&#x27;s challenging and creative, but not as outright frustrating as &quot;Wario Land 3.&quot;&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; noted &quot;It&#x27;s nothing new to the Wario Land enthusiast, but it&#x27;s enjoyable nonetheless&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; stated &quot;It&#x27;s polished variety paired with a mishmash of moves, which makes &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; fun through and through&quot;.

&quot;Wario Land 4&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Game Boy Advance Game&quot; and, among console games, &quot;Best Platform Game&quot; awards. These went respectively to &quot;Advance Wars&quot; and &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Wario Land 4&quot; has served as an inspiration for several indie games following its release. &quot;Pizza Tower&quot; (2023) and &quot;Antonblast&quot; (2024) were both directly inspired by &quot;Wario Land 4&quot;, as confirmed by their respective developers, with both games incorporating their own takes on Wario&#x27;s transformations and the game&#x27;s level-end escape segments (the latter known as &quot;Pizza Time&quot; in &quot;Pizza Tower&quot; and &quot;Happy Hour&quot; in &quot;Antonblast&quot;).

&quot;Wario World&quot;″s gameplay centers mainly on combating enemies, although it requires some platform navigation similar to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. The controls are simple, and are only used to jump, run, dash, perform fighting moves, and use the &quot;Hyper Suction&quot; ability to collect nearby coins. The level designs are platform-based with combat elements, and have an overall linear design. The levels contain trapdoors, which lead to special platforming or puzzle-oriented challenges. Throughout the game, small forest sprites known as &quot;Spritelings&quot; give Wario advice if they are rescued from imprisonment.

During combat, Wario can grab enemies and either spin them around, throw them, or piledrive them into the ground. Enemies drop coins when defeated, and tend to regenerate if the area is left and returned to later. The coins are used to purchase items, such as life-restoring garlic, and to return to life. If Wario does not have enough money to return to life, the game is over. A new feature in &quot;Wario World&quot; are the spherical &quot;glue globes&quot;, in which Wario is stuck to if he touches it, allowing the player to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Along the way, Wario can re-collect his lost treasures, which are hidden in treasure chests, and collect pieces of golden Wario statues, which increases Wario&#x27;s life meter by one half. In order to advance in the game, the player must collect a certain amount of red diamonds in each level. If the player collects all the treasure in the various levels, minigames from the Game Boy Advance title &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot; are unlocked, and they can be played by using the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.

==Plot==
The game begins with Wario enjoying his newly built castle, which is filled with treasures that he has collected from earlier adventures. An evil gem called Black Jewel, hidden amongst Wario&#x27;s treasure collection, suddenly awakens and takes over the castle. Black Jewel turns Wario&#x27;s treasure into monsters, and transforms the castle into four worlds called Excitement Central, Spooktastic World, Thrillsville, and Sparkle Land, each consisting of two levels and a boss fight. A central area allows access to the different worlds, as well as to the Treasure Square, where the Huge Treasure Box inside of which Black Jewel is hiding can be found. Wario proceeds through the areas controlled by Black Jewel, recovering his treasure and rescuing Spritelings (the creatures that had sealed Black Jewel away in the past), then obtains the key to the Huge Treasure Box and engages Black Jewel in a battle. Wario&#x27;s subsequent victory allows him to regain control of his castle.

During the game&#x27;s ending, Wario&#x27;s new castle quality depends on the number of Spritelings rescued. The worst-case scenario sees Wario with nothing but a campsite with his throne in a dark jungle, but if all 40 Spritelings were rescued, Wario is given a palace even grander than his previous one.

==Development and release==
&quot;Wario World&quot; was shown at E3 2002 as a technical demo. At the next E3 in 2003, it was shown with levels of gameplay polish and tweaking, which the previous E3 demo was lacking. On August 22, 2002, at Nintendo&#x27;s Gamer&#x27;s Summit, &quot;Wario World&quot;″s North American release date was set to November 11, 2002. The game&#x27;s release date was pushed back to May 26, 2003, but was further delayed again by one month until June 23, 2003. The game was released in Europe on June 20, in Australia on July 10, and in Japan the following year on May 27, 2004.

It was uncertain who was developing &quot;Wario World&quot;, until April 22, 2003, when Nintendo of America revealed that Treasure was developing the game. After the successful development collaboration Treasure and Nintendo shared with the Nintendo 64 title, &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;, the two companies wanted to work together again. The R&amp;D1 team wanted to continue their co-development juncture with a 3D installment of the &quot;Wario&quot; franchise. &quot;Wario World&quot;″s music was composed by Norio Hanzawa and Minako Hamano. Wario was voiced by Charles Martinet, who also voices Mario and Luigi in the &quot;Mario&quot; series.

==Reception==

&quot;Wario World&quot; was a commercial success, selling over 142,000 copies in Japan and 256,000 copies in the US. In 2004, the game was re-released alongside &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot; and &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; as part of the Player&#x27;s Choice line, a selection of games with high sales sold for a reduced price.

&quot;Wario World&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The US version of &quot;Play&quot; magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that &quot;Wario World&quot; &quot;pays off every second [he is] holding the controller, and that, to [him], is greatness&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; said that the game was &quot;tons of fun&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that &quot;Wario World&quot; &quot;stays addictive by weight of sheer design innovation&quot;. The American-based publication &quot;Game Informer&quot; praised the game for including &quot;droves of awesome boss battles&quot;. Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; declared that &quot;Wario World&quot; had &quot;some great control mechanics and inventive level work&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Greg Ford said, &quot;&quot;Wario&quot; [&quot;World&quot;] delivers a great time while it lasts and is well worth checking out. Just don&#x27;t expect a Mario-quality adventure&quot;. Worthplaying gave the game 9 out 10, stating that &quot;Treasure has done itself proud with this title, and Wario himself can lift his head up high. At least in my book, he&#x27;s got at least one game that&#x27;s better than Mario&#x27;s.&quot;

&quot;Wario World&quot; received criticism for its length, with some reviewers stating that the game was shorter than the average console title. Tom Bramwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; compared &quot;Wario World&quot; to &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, a game also criticized for its length, and said that the game was like &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; &quot;all over again&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; stated that &quot;Wario World&quot; &quot;offers little above and beyond the standard 3D platform romp, and what is offered turns out to be very short and repetitive&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that &quot;the final product is too short and simplistic to hold your attention for more than a day&quot;.

<text>Alexander Kartveli, born Aleksandre Kartvelishvili, (; September 9, 1896 – July 20, 1974) was a Georgian aeronautical engineer and an aviation pioneer in the United States. Kartveli achieved important breakthroughs in military aviation in the time of turbojet fighters.

==Education and early career==
Alexander Kartvelishvili was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, which was part of the Russian Empire at that time; into a noble Georgian family. (Georgians call themselves &quot;kartvelebi&quot;, and his surname derives from &quot;Kartveli&quot;, or Georgian). He graduated from the grammar school in Tbilisi in 1914. Later on, he decided to move to France, as one of several aviation engineer aspirants of Georgian origin, such as Michael Gregor.

Kartvelishvili graduated in 1922 from the Institut supérieur de l&#x27;aéronautique et de l&#x27;espace in Paris. He began working as a test pilot but was seriously injured during a test flight which ended the short-lived career. In 1922–1927, he worked for a while at the Louis Blériot company and designed the Bernard and Ferbois aircraft. In 1924, one of his aircraft established a world speed record.

In 1927, the American millionaire Charles Levine invited Kartvelishvili to New York, to join the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation in 1928 and in 1931 Kartvelishvili met the prominent engineer Alexander de Seversky, who was born in Georgia but was of Russian descent. In Seversky&#x27;s company, which later was renamed Seversky Aircraft Corporation, Kartvelishvili worked as chief engineer. In 1939 the company again changed its name to &quot;Republic Aviation Company&quot;.

==Seversky Corporation==
Kartvelishvili and Seversky worked on a series of new designs. During World War II the first projects resulted in the P-35 and one of the most effective US fighter aircraft of World War 2, the Republic P-47. The new fighter aircraft was a clear improvement over the comparatively lightly armed Seversky P-35.

After Kartvelishvili immigrated to the United States, Seversky almost immediately hired his fellow immigrant as chief engineer, and Kartveli quickly proceeded to design a number of very advanced aircraft, including the SEV-1XP, which outperformed the Curtiss P-36 Hawk during a 1936 Army Air Corps competition and served as a necessary step in developing all-metal aircraft. Known by the military designation Seversky P-35, it was the first modern US Army fighter, incorporating a metal fuselage, low-set wings, retractable landing gear and a radial engine. A different concept called Seversky SEV-3, a floatplane fitted with retractable wheels, failed to win a volume order, but the Seversky Corporation succeeded with selling a subsequent trainer model, the BT-8

==Republic Aviation Company==
In 1939, Seversky was removed as head of his company and the Republic Aviation Company was born. The first major aircraft to emerge from the new company was the P-47, using a new innovative design of Kartveli. Two concept works named XP-44 and XP-47 were developed but dropped as they did not meet the requirements of the Air Corps. According to records, Kartveli was called in from the Experimental Aircraft Division of the USAAC and informed about the prototypes being cancelled. During his return to New York on a train, he took a sheet of paper and drew a completely new design. The new aircraft was intended to break the back of the German Luftwaffe. The famous P-47 Thunderbolt with its robust characteristics was born. More than 15,000 P-47s were constructed. Despite some flaws, the heavily armed and extremely sturdy aircraft achieved more than Kartveli could hope.
At the end of the war Kartveli designed a sleek flying photo lab called the Republic XF-12, initially planned as a four-engine postwar transport; American Airlines canceled its orders and only two prototypes were built for the US Air Force.

Shortly after the end of World War II new concept of turbojet fighters would emerge. The F-84 Thunderjet which Kartveli had already developed in 1944, was going into serial production in 1946. Soon he would also add the swept-wing variant Republic F-84F Thunderstreak. A total of 10,000 of these new generation aircraft would be constructed. He would later lead the team that developed the F-105 Thunderchief. He was also heavily involved with a 1960s-era Air Force project called &quot;Aerospaceplane&quot;, to design and build an orbital logistics vehicle a decade before NASA attempted a similar concept, known as the Space Shuttle. The radical turboramjet-powered XF-103 was another stillborn Kartveli design, a victim of the propulsion community not being able to produce a suitable engine to power the Mach 3 interceptor. Kartveli contributed significantly to the science of flight and the readiness of the US military, and was involved in designing and leading of various projects. He was also consultant at Fairchild Republic and was the primary designer of the A-10 Thunderbolt II.

==Major projects==
===P-47 Thunderbolt===

The Republic P-47 was Alexander Kartveli&#x27;s brainchild and the successor to a line of airplanes derived from the Seversky P-35, the XP-41, P-43 Lancer and XP-44 Rocket. The P-47 design team headed by Kartveli originally presented a design that was to be powered by a 1,150 hp Allison V-1710-39 engine with an armament of only two 0.50 inch machine guns. A contract was awarded by the USAAC in November 1939, and for an even lighter XP-47A, but as intelligence was coming back from the war in Europe, it was becoming apparent that the performance goals of the XP-47 program were already inadequate. The USAAC issued new requirements which included:
# Airspeed of 400 mph at 25,000 feet
# Armament of six .50 caliber machine guns, preferably eight
# Armor plating to protect the pilot
# Self-sealing fuel tanks
# A minimum of 315 gallons of fuel

The USAAC notified Kartveli that the XP-47A and the XP-44 Rocket contracts were canceled, since the P-43/XP-44 airframe was too small to meet the new requirements. (The XP-44 Rocket was based on the P-43 Lancer airframe with an even more powerful radial engine and never made it past the mock-up stage.) Kartveli then took the Seversky AP-4, a daring concept with the exhaust-driven turbocharger in the rear fuselage belly, and quickly prepared a rough sketch of a new XP-47B prototype. He planned to use the new 2,000 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney Double Wasp XR-2800-21, eighteen cylinder, two-row radial engine, which was the largest and most powerful aircraft engine ever developed in the United States. The new design would incorporate eight 0.50 inch machine guns, additional ammunition, increased fuel capacity, and armor protection for the pilot. (The final fuel load was slightly under the capacity required, but this was overlooked as the aircraft met performance specifications.) Additionally, the airplane would include an efficient super-charging duct system that would offer the least interrupted airflow. Kartveli therefore adopted the unorthodox method of designing this feature first, and then building up the fuselage around it. Despite the fact that the supercharger was in the tail and the engine was in the nose, the arrangement worked quite well, providing a system that was durable and less susceptible to battle damage.

One of the most important features of the P-47 was its remarkable acceleration when the aircraft was put into a dive. Any plane that attempted to break off contact by going into a dive would soon be overcome by the remarkable speed of the P-47. Once the P-47 caught up to its prey, one burst from its eight 0.50 machine guns would obliterate anything it hit.

===F-84 Thunderjet/F-84F Thunderstreak===

In 1944, Kartveli began working on a turbojet-powered replacement for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a brand-new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings. On September 11, 1944, the United States Army Air Force released General Operational Requirements for a day fighter with a top speed of 600 mph (521 knots, 966 km/h), combat radius of 705 miles (612 nm, 1,135 km), and armament of either six 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) or four 0.60 inch (15.2 mm) machine guns. In addition, the new aircraft had to use the General Electric TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the Allison J35.

On November 11, 1944, Republic received an order for three prototypes of the new XP-84. Since the design promised superior performance to the P-80 Shooting Star and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name Thunderjet was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On January 4, 1945, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF expanded its order to 25 service test YP-84A and 75 production P-84B (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B). Meanwhile, wind tunnel testing by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics revealed longitudinal instability and buckling of stabilizer skin at high speeds. The weight of the aircraft, a great concern given the low thrust of early turbojets, was growing so quickly that the USAAF had to set a gross weight limit of 13,400 pounds (6,078 kg). The results of preliminary testing were incorporated into the third prototype, designated XP-84A, which was also fitted with a more powerful J35-GE-15 engine with 4,000 pound-force (17.80 kN) of thrust.

The first prototype XP-84 was transferred to Muroc Army Air Field (present-day Edwards Air Force Base) where it flew for the first time on February 28, 1946, with Major William A. Lien at the controls. It was joined by the second prototype in August, both aircraft flying with J35-GE-7 engines producing 3,745 pound-force (16.66 kN) of thrust. The fifteen YP-84As delivered to Patterson Field (present-day Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) for service tests differed from XP-84s in having an upgraded J35-A-15 engine, carrying six 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) Browning M2 machine guns (four in the nose and one in each wing root), and having the provision for wingtip fuel tanks holding 226 US gallons (870 L) each. Due to delays with delivery of jet engines and production of the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied, which proved problematic later.

After creation of the United States Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, the Pursuit designation was replaced with Fighter, and P-84 became the F-84.

===F-105 Thunderchief===

The design of the F-105 Thunderchief began in the early 1950s as an internal project at Republic and was headed by Alexander Kartveli. Intended to be a replacement for the F-84 Thunderjet, the F-105 was created as a supersonic, low-altitude penetrator capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to a target deep within the Soviet Union. Led by Kartveli, the design team produced an aircraft centered on a large engine and able to achieve high speeds. As the F-105 was meant to be a penetrator, maneuverability was sacrificed for speed and low-altitude performance.

Intrigued by Republic&#x27;s design, the US Air Force placed an initial order for 199 F-105s in September 1952, but with the Korean War winding down reduced it to 46 six months later. On October 22, 1955, the first YF-105A prototype flew, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-25 engine. Test flights with the YF-105A soon revealed that the aircraft was underpowered and suffered from problems with transonic drag. To counter these issues Republic replaced the engine with the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J75, altered the arrangement of the air intakes, and redesigned the F-105&#x27;s fuselage.

The redesigned aircraft, dubbed the F-105B, proved able to achieve speeds of Mach 2.15. Also included were improvements to its electronics including the MA-8 fire control system, a K19 gun sight, and an AN/APG-31 ranging radar. With the alterations complete, the YF-105B first took to the sky on May 26, 1956. The largest single-engine fighter built for the US Air Force, the production model F-105B possessed an internal bomb bay and five external weapons pylons. The US Air Force planned to purchase 1,500 F-105s, however this order was reduced to 833 by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.

==Death==
Alexander Kartveli died on July 20, 1974, at Huntington (Long Island) Hospital, New York, USA.

The announcement by the Fairchild Republic Company, where Mr. Kartveli had been chief engineer emeritus and was still active as a consultant, said he had apparently succumbed to a heart attack at his home in Huntington.

The airport in Batumi in Western Georgia carries his name.

<doc id="442520" wikidata="Q5084691" url="?curid=442520" title="Charlie Chester">
<text>Charlie Chester MBE (26 April 1914 – 26 June 1997) was an English comedian, radio and television presenter and writer, broadcasting almost continuously from the 1940s to the 1990s. His style was similar to that of Max Miller.

== Life and career ==

Chester was born Cecil Victor Manser in Eastbourne, Sussex. His first job after leaving education was as a grocer&#x27;s errand boy, but he won talent competitions for his musical instrument playing and singing. Working as a travelling salesman for an embroidery company, Chester realised he had the gift of the gab and decided to become a professional comedian. 

Known as &quot;Cheerful&quot; Charlie Chester, he was popular with British audiences in the 1940s from his BBC radio show &quot;Stand Easy&quot;. This show was adapted for television as &quot;The Charlie Chester Show&quot; in 1949 and became a stand-up and sketch show for the next 11 years. Frequent cast members included Edwina Carroll, Henry Lytton, Jr., Eric &quot;Jeeves&quot; Grier, Len Lowe, Deryck Guyler, Len Marten, Arthur Haynes and Frederick Ferrari. A later recurring mini-serial in the show was &quot;Whippit Kwik the Cat Burglar&quot;, whose whistled signature tune made Chester a national favourite. Tenor St Clair was replaced by Ferrari, known as &quot;The Voice&quot;, and for whom Chester wrote the signature song &quot;When Love Descended like an Angel&quot;. That was in fact the only fragment written, until listeners&#x27; demands forced him to write a full version so that Ferrari could record it.

Chester&#x27;s radio shows included &quot;A Proper Charlie,&quot; &quot;That Man Chester&quot;, and &quot;Pot Luck&quot;.

In 1961, Chester starred in a BBC series called &quot;Charlie Chester On Laughter Service&quot;, a music and comedy show that visited military bases throughout Britain. Most were co-written by Bernard Botting and Charlie Hart. Late in his career, Chester appeared in the Channel 4 television sitcom &quot;Never Say Die&quot;.

In the 1960s, he began presenting a record show on the BBC Light Programme, later BBC Radio 2. On 5 October 1970 he started his weekday show which from 1 October 1972 became his long-running radio show &quot;Sunday Soapbox&quot;, which in later years came from the BBC&#x27;s Birmingham studios (previously from Manchester). He opened the programme each week with the introduction &quot;With a box full of records and a bag full of post, it&#x27;s radio Soapbox and Charlie your host!&quot; The programme was transmitted on Sunday afternoons until Chester suffered a stroke in November 1995, after which he could not walk or talk. Its opening and signature tune was called &quot;Music To Drive By&quot; by Alan Moorhouse.

==Honours and recognition==
He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

A casino club in Archer Street, Soho, was named &quot;Charlie Chester&#x27;s&quot; after him.

Chester presented brass band music in the series &quot;Listen to the Band&quot; and also featured in the BBC Radio 2 show &quot;The Gag Cracker&#x27;s Ball&quot;. In his leisure time he enjoyed painting. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1990 Birthday Honours for charitable services.

==Death==
He suffered a stroke and died in Twickenham on 26 June 1997 aged 83.

<text>Fulwar Skipwith (February 21, 1765 – January 7, 1839) was an American soldier, diplomat, politician and farmer. A veteran of the American Revolutionary War, he served as a U.S. Consul in Martinique, and later as the U.S. Consul-General in France. He was instrumental in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, was the first and only governor of the Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was a founding member of the Agricultural Society of Baton Rouge.

==Early life==
Skipwith was born into an influential family in Dinwiddie County, Virginia.

His cousin, Henry Skipwith, was a brother-in-law to Thomas Jefferson, the U.S. President 1801–1809. Skipwith studied at the College of William &amp; Mary, but left at age 16 to enlist in the army during the American Revolutionary War. He served at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. After American independence was achieved, he entered the tobacco trade.

==Diplomatic career &amp; family==

Following the French Revolution of 1789, Skipwith was appointed as US Consul to the French colony of Martinique in 1790. He experienced the turmoil of the Revolution, as well as the aftermath of the abortive slave insurrection in Martinique, before departing in 1793. In 1795, Skipwith was appointed Consul-General in Paris under the US Minister to France, James Monroe.

On June 2, 1802, Fulwar Skipwith married Evelina Louisa Barlié Van den Clooster, a Flemish baroness. Their children were Lelia, who married Thomas B. Robertson; Evelina, who married Edward H. Barton; and George Grey Skipwith.

Skipwith assisted Robert Livingston (known as &quot;The Chancellor&quot; for the high New York state legal office he held) in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase, and actively participated in the transfer of 828,000 square miles of land in its southern part.

==Republic of West Florida==
In 1809, Skipwith moved to Spanish West Florida. As a member of the first West Florida judiciary, he took part in the 1810 West Florida rebellion against Spain, and served as Governor of the short-lived Republic of West Florida. On October 27, 1810, West Florida of U.S. President James Madison, who claimed it as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

At first, Skipwith and the West Florida governmentlocated in St. Francisvillewere opposed to the proclamation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union as a separate state. However, the Territory of Orleans Governor, William C. C. Claiborne, who led armed troops to take possession in December 1810, refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the West Florida government. Skipwith and the legislature reluctantly agreed to accept Madison&#x27;s proclamation, believing it not sufficiently respectful of the elected government.

==Later life==
Skipwith was elected to serve in the Louisiana State Senate where he served as that body&#x27;s second President. In December 1814, during the War of 1812, Magloire Guichard and Skipwith sponsored a legislative resolution to grant amnesty to &quot;the privateers lately resorting to Barataria, who might be deterred from offering their services for fear of prosecution.&quot; This led to Jean Lafitte and his men joining in the defense of New Orleans during the Battle of New Orleans, when the city was attacked by British forces.

In 1827, Skipwith, Armand Duplantier, Antoine Blanc, Thomas B. Robertson, and Sebastien Hiriart received permission from the Louisiana State Legislature to organize a corporation called the Agricultural Society of Baton Rouge. The purpose of the society was as follows: &quot;The sole and special objects of the said society shall be the improvement of agriculture, the amelioration of the breed of horses, of horned cattle, and others, and in all of the several branches relative to agriculture in a country.&quot;

Skipwith died at his plantation, Montesano, near Baton Rouge, on January 7, 1839, at age 73.

<text>Anti-Slavery International, founded as the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1839, is an international non-governmental organisation, registered charity and advocacy group, based in the United Kingdom. It is the world&#x27;s oldest international human rights organisation, and works exclusively against slavery and related abuses.

In 1909, the society merged with the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society to form the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society, whose prominent member was Kathleen Simon, Viscountess Simon. It became the Anti-Slavery Society in July 1947, and from 1956 to 1990 it was named the Anti-Slavery Society for the Protection of Human Rights. In 1990 it was renamed Anti-Slavery International for the Protection of Human Rights, and in 1995 relaunched as Anti-Slavery International.

It owes its origins to the radical element of an older organisation also commonly referred to as the &quot;Anti-Slavery Society&quot;, the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions, which had substantially achieved abolition of slavery in the British Empire by August 1838.

The new British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society was created to campaign against the practice of slavery in other countries.
==History==
===Background===

The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, founded in 1787, also referred to as the Abolition Society, was responsible for achieving abolition of the international slave trade, when the British Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act 1807.

The Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions, later known as the (London) Anti-slavery Society, was founded in 1823 and was committed to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, which was substantially achieved in 1838 under the terms of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.

===19th-century===
With abolition of slavery throughout the British dominions achieved, British abolitionists in the Agency Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society considered that a successor organisation was needed to tackle slavery worldwide. Largely under the guidance of English activist Joseph Sturge, the committee duly formed a new society, British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society on 17 April 1839, which worked to outlaw slavery in other countries. It became widely known as the Anti-Slavery Society, as had the earlier society.

The first secretary was John Harfield Tredgold, the first treasurer, George William Alexander of Stoke Newington. Along with the founding committee, which included the Anglican Thomas Fowell Buxton, the Quaker William Allen, and the Congregationalist Josiah Conder, they organised the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840, that attracted delegates from around the world (including from the United States of America, in the South of which slavery was at times referred to as &quot;our peculiar institution&quot;) to the Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London on 12 June 1840. Many delegates were notable abolitionists, with Thomas Clarkson the key speaker, and the image of the meeting was captured in a remarkable painting that still hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London.
The convention had been advertised as a &quot;whole world&quot; convention, but the delegates representing anti-slavery societies in the United States included several women, among them Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who later were instrumental in the movement for women&#x27;s rights. Convention leaders refused to seat the women delegates from America, and prominent male abolitionists such as Thomas Knight were outraged. He went on to form his own society.

In the 1850s, under Louis Chamerovzow, the society helped John Brown write and publish his autobiography a decade before the American Civil War ended slavery in the United States.

The second secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, appointed under the honorary secretaries Joseph Cooper and Edmund Sturge, was the Rev. Aaron Buzacott (1829–81), the son of a South Seas missionary also named Aaron Buzacott. With American slavery abolished in 1865, Buzacott worked closely with Joseph Cooper in researching and publishing work designed to help abolish slavery in elsewhere, particularly in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa.

===20th century===
The first half of the 20th-century was the last phase of the campaign against legal chattel slavery. Legal chattel slavery was finally ended on the Arabian Peninsula between 1937 and 1970. Mauritania ended slavery in 1981. The second half of the 20th-century saw a shift to the campaign against modern slavery, exploitative working conditions and illegal trafficking.

====Before World War II ====

At the beginning of the 20th century Anti-Slavery Society campaigned against slavery practices perpetrated in the Congo Free State by King Leopold II of Belgium. It was the first campaign in history that used photography to document the abuses (photographs were taken by the missionary Alice Seeley Harris). The campaign eventually helped bring an end to Leopold&#x27;s tyranny.

In 1909, the society merged with the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society to form the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society. Kathleen Simon, Viscountess Simon was a prominent member and stalwart of the society.

In the 1920s, the Society helped end the indentured labour system in the British colonies after campaigning against the use of Indian and Chinese &quot;coolies&quot;. 
In 1921 Played a pivotal role in ending the activities of the Peruvian Amazon Company, which was using indigenous slave labour in rubber production.

The organisation also successfully lobbied for the League of Nations inquiry into slavery, which resulted in the 1926 Slavery Convention that obliged all ratifying states to end slavery. 
When the League of Nations collected information of slavery on a global level in 1922–1923, Anti-Slavery International and the Swiss 
Bureau international pour la défense des indigènes (International Bureau for the Defense of the Native Races, BIDI) were among the most important participants in it. 
Following the investigation, the League founded the Temporary Slavery Commission (TSC) in June 1924. The TSC filed their report on 1925 with the recommendation to outlaw the institution of legal cattle slavery and slave trade, which resulted in the 1926 Slavery Convention. 
In 1932 the Committee of Experts on Slavery was established to investigate the efficiency of the 1926 Slavery Convention, which in turn resulted in the establishment of the permanent Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE).

The Anti-Slavery Society celebrated the establishment of the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE), which was established on the centenary of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, as the final end of slavery, Reginald Coupland expressed the hope that &quot;the appropriate machinery&quot; to ensure the execution of the 1926 Slavery Convention had been created, and that he had no doubt that &quot;except perhaps in remote and unsettled regions of the world beyond the reach of civilized opinion, the final eradication...of slavery&quot; had been assured.

The global investigation of the occurrence of slavery and slave trade performed by the Advisory Committee of Experts on Slavery (ACE) of the League of Nations between 1934 and 1939 was interrupted by the outbreak of the World War II, but it was the foundation for the work against slavery performed by the UN after the war.

In 1944, a Journalist James Ewing Ritchie issued a paper to the society on sugar trade and slavery.

====After World War II ====

Between 1945 and 1962, the Anti-Slavery Society actively fought to end the ongoing Red Sea slave trade and the slavery in the Arabian Peninsula, and built allies across the world and in the United States to achieve its goal until slavery in Saudi Arabia was finally abolished in 1962.

When the League of Nations was succeeded by the United Nations (UN) after the end of the World War II, Greenidge of the Anti-Slavery International worked for the UN to continue the investigation of global slavery conducted by the ACE of the League, and in February 1950 the 
Ad hoc Committee on Slavery of the United Nations was inaugurated.
By the 1950s, legal chattel slavery and slave trade was formally abolished by law in almost the entire world, with the exception of the Arabian Peninsula. Chattel slavery was still legal in Saudi Arabia, in Yemen, in the Trucial States and in Oman, while slavery in Qatar was abolished in 1952, and slaves were supplied for the Arabian Peninsula by the Red Sea slave trade.

The UN Committee on Slavery presented its raport of global slavery to the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 1951; it was published in 1953, and a Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery was written in 1954, and introduced in 1956.

The Anti Slavery Society actively campaigned against the slavery and slave trade in the Arabian Peninsula from the conclusion of World War II until the 1970s, and particularly publicized Saudi Arabia&#x27;s central role in 20th-century chattel Slavery within the United Nations, but their efforts was long opposed by the lack of support from London and Washington.
The British Foreign Office&#x27;s internal reports noted an upswing in the slave trade to Saudi Arabia after WII, but preferred to turn a blind eye to it to avoid international exposure of their own Gulf Sheikh allies&#x27; complicity in the slave trade.

The US Eisenhower administration sought to undermine the Bricker Amendment by a retreat from the UN, and made Saudi Arabia a cornerstone of the Eisenhower Doctrine, and therefore abstained from the &quot;United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery&quot;.
The British Anti Slavery Society failed to pass stricter enforcements at the 1956 UN Supplementary Convention on Slavery, but the issue started to attract international attention.

When President Kennedy took office, the issue of slavery within the US ally Saudi Arabia had caused growing domestic and international attention and caused damage to the Kennedy administration&#x27;s liberal world-order rhetoric and the US-Saudi partnership, and Kennedy pressed Saudi leaders to &quot;modernize and reform&quot; if they wished US military assistance during the Yemeni Civil War. 
President Kennedy wished to strengthen the UN, which in turn also strengthened the long going abolition campaign of the British Anti Slavery Society within the UN and gave it gravitas.

The Kennedy administration also experienced international pressure from influential secular Middle East regional leaders like Gamal Abdul Nasser, as well as from the newly decolonization African states, whose own citizens were the most common victims of the slave trade to the Arabian Peninsula, and whose good will was necessary Kennedy&#x27;s anti Soviet New Frontier agenda in the Global South. The Kennedy administration therefore put pressure on Saudi Arabia to introduce &quot;modernization reforms&quot;, a request which was heavily directed against slavery.

In November 1962, Faisal of Saudi Arabia finally prohibited the owning of slaves in Saudi Arabia, followed by the abolition of slavery in Yemen in 1962, slavery in Dubai 1963 and slavery in Oman in 1970.

From 1947 to 1956, it was called the Anti-Slavery Society, and from 1956 to 1990 the Anti-Slavery Society for the Protection of Human Rights. In 1990, it was renamed Anti-Slavery International for the Protection of Human Rights, and in 1995 Anti-Slavery International.

Anti-Slavery International was one of the original supporters of the &quot;End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking&quot; campaign (ECPAT), and helped set up the UK branch in the 1990s. It also helped to organise the 1998 Global March against Child Labour, which helped lead to the adoption of a new International Labour Organization Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour in 1999.

===21st century: Modern-day slavery===
In the 21st century, it worked with Nepalese NGO INSEC to secure Government backing to abolish the Kamaiya form of bonded labour; in 2003 with local NGO Timidria conducted a survey that led to the criminalisation of slavery in Niger, and lobbied the Brazilian government to introduce a National Plan for the Eradication of Slavery. Two years later ASI organised a major campaign on child camel jockeys in the Gulf States, which influenced the UAE&#x27;s decision to rescue and repatriate up to 3,000 child camel jockeys.

In the UK, it successfully lobbied to make trafficking of sexual and labour exploitation a criminal offence in 2004.

In 2008, it was amongst groups that supported a former slave, Hadijatou Mani, in obtaining the verdict of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court that found the state of Niger guilty of failing to protect her from slavery. The ruling set a legal precedent with respect to the obligations of states to protect its citizens from slavery

In June 2010, following the campaign by Anti-Slavery International and Liberty the UK Parliament introduced a criminal offence of forced labour in the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. In 2010 the organisation also exposed the routine use of the forced labour of girls and young women in the manufacture of garments in Southern India for Western high streets, prompting, eventually, business and international civil society efforts to end the practice.

Anti-Slavery lobbied the UK government to sign up to an EU anti-trafficking law to protect the victims and secure justice for people who have been trafficked (2011). It also played a big part in lobbying the International Labour Organization to adopt a Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers in June 2011.

In 2021, Anti-Slavery International has pressured businesses and governments to address conditions in the Xinjiang cotton industry.

====Human trafficking====
Human trafficking is the illegal transportation of kidnapped people, including children, across international borders in order to put them into slavery at the destination. This form of modern slavery is one of the most common and may affect the most people: it is estimated that between 500,000 and 800,000 victims enter the trade each year.

The International Labour Organization estimates that, by their definitions, over 40 million people are in some form of slavery today. 24.9 million people are in forced labor, of whom 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labour imposed by state authorities. 15.4 million people are in forced marriage.

Anti-Slavery International points to the lack of enforcement of existing laws as a barrier to stopping human trafficking. Discrimination on the basis of social status, religion, ethnicity, gender and immigration status operate as additional barriers. The organization joined more than 180 other groups in a campaign to pressure retailers such as Nike, Apple and Gap to stop using forced labour of Uighurs in their factories located in China.

==Overview==
Anti-Slavery International is the world&#x27;s oldest international human rights organisation, and bases its work on the United Nations treaties against slavery. It has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and observer status at the International Labour Organization. It is a non-religious, non-political independent organisation. It works closely with partner organisations from around the world to tackle all forms of slavery.
==Publications==
The society published &quot;The Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot; from 1839, taking over from the earlier organisation (named the London Anti-slavery Society in its last year of existence).

The journal merged with the &quot;Aborigines&#x27; Friend&quot; to form the &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter and Aborigines&#x27; Friend&quot; in 1909, when the BFASS merged with the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society.

==Anti-Slavery Award==

Anti-Slavery International instituted the Anti-Slavery Award in 1991 to draw attention to the continuing problem of slavery in the world today and to provide recognition for long-term, courageous campaigning by organisations or individuals in the countries most affected.

<doc id="442534" wikidata="Q7743064" url="?curid=442534" title="The Jealous Sound">
<text>The Jealous Sound was an American band based in Los Angeles that, as of August 2012, consisted of vocalist and guitarist Blair Shehan (formerly of Knapsack), guitarist Michael Richardson, bassist Jeremy Tappero, and drummer Bob Penn. In 2012, Richardson (formerly of the American three-piece rock band, The New Trust) replaced original member, Pedro Benito (formerly of Sunday&#x27;s Best) on lead guitar. Benito has moved into film and television score composition. Categorized as an indie rock band, the Jealous Sound released its second and last full-length album, &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot;, on January 31, 2012. As of December 2016, the band was signed to Rise Records.

==History==

===Formation (2000)===
The band originally formed from multiple American, 1990s &quot;indie&quot; bands, with each member a former part of one of these groups. Shehan (Knapsack) led the band on vocals and guitar, with Benito (Sunday&#x27;s Best) on lead guitar. They were joined by bassist John McGinnis (Neither Trumpets Nor Drums) and Tony Palermo (Pulley) on drums. Adam Wade, of the then-recently disbanded Jawbox and Shudder to Think, later replaced Palermo on drums.

Shehan provided a summary in January 2013 interview:
Me and the drummer from Knapsack, my friend Colby [Mancasola], went to high school together ... We went to college together and when we got to college at UC-Davis, we formed Knapsack ... I hung out in the area after we graduated and ended up moving to L.A. Colby decided to take a full-time job with eMusic and [bassist] Sergie Loobkoff was splitting time with his band Samiam, which had kicked back into gear, so his time was divided. Colby wanted to move on and we did one last tour with At the Drive-In and that was that. In L.A., I started moving forward with The Jealous Sound in 1999 and 2000.

Shehan further explained that the eventual formation (&quot;morphing&quot;) of the Jealous Sound was inevitable, as the band is not dissimilar to Knapsack, asserting, &quot;This is the direction I had wanted to go and was going and would continue to go.&quot;

===Self-titled EP and &quot;Kill Them With Kindness&quot; (2000–2003)===

The band&#x27;s self-titled debut EP &quot;The Jealous Sound&quot; was released in 2000 on the Better Looking Records label.

The debut album, &quot;Kill Them With Kindness&quot;, recorded with producer Tim O&#x27;Heir and also released on Better Looking Records, ranked No. 39 on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;40 Best Albums of 2003&quot; list; the magazine&#x27;s review in June 2003, by Andy Greenwald, rated the album as &quot;9 of 10&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s success, the band received major label attention and subsequently signed with Mojo Records.

===&quot;Got Friends&quot; EP (2005–2008)===
In 2003, the band was set to release an album on Mojo Records, but soon after the signing, Mojo was sold to Jive Records. However, the latter did not display a keen interest in the band (Shehan stated that &quot;They were interested, but they didn&#x27;t want to do one thing or another.&quot;). The band pressured the label to release it from its contractual obligations, and Jive eventually paid the band to depart from its roster. The band then signed with The Militia Group for their second album, and used the money from Jive to release the &quot;Got Friends&quot; EP. Shehan eventually clarified the situation in January 2013, explaining, &quot;It was a funny situation. Things are so different now than they were back then. There was some chatter about it [the major label contract] being the reason why the band broke up. That had nothing to do with it.&quot;

The band&#x27;s official website was not updated for the remainder of 2005, and a rumor spread that Shehan had left the band. However, on June 1, 2006, the band posted on its MySpace page that work on the next album was progressing. On August 24, 2005, a Militia Group staff member publicly stated, &quot;I have heard the new songs myself. They&#x27;re still putting out material.&quot;

After a long silence, leading to more rumors of the band&#x27;s demise, on August 15, 2008, the band posted on their MySpace page confirming the title of their new release, &quot;Got Friends&quot;. The post said the album would be out &quot;real soon&quot; and to stay tuned. On September 4, 2008, the band posted the following on their MySpace page: &quot;Got Friends available on iTunes 10/14/2008&quot;. The &quot;Got Friends&quot; EP was released in October 2008.

The rumors of the band&#x27;s demise were confounded when, according to a blog post on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s website posted on October 14, 2008, the Jealous Sound broke up in 2005, and the songs on the &quot;Got Friends&quot; EP were &quot;the last shreds of material recorded [for a new album] before Shehan went crazy and more or less disappeared.&quot; Shehan later revealed that he relocated to Las Vegas, US, where he had secured employment; Shehan explained in an interview:
There&#x27;s a sense that I flipped out and left; people thought I went crazy. But what&#x27;s crazy? Staying in a band at my age with no stability? Ignoring the normal parts of becoming an adult? People don&#x27;t necessarily understand what we do, and the commitment it takes to do what we do.

Following two years in Las Vegas, Shehan briefly moved to Florida before resuming work on the Jealous Sound. In January 2013, he further clarified, &quot;Personally, I was out of gas. It was a strange time. We had started a record but didn’t finish and I ended up leaving and we didn’t do it. I feel bad about that. That was a failure on my part. I came back and life’s funny. It’s all okay and those are just the things that happened.&quot;

===End of hiatus===
Shehan&#x27;s return to Los Angeles signified the end of the band&#x27;s hiatus. On February 13, 2009, the band published a blog post titled &quot;There is hope for us...&quot; on their Myspace page, with a short message promising more from the band soon. &quot;Thank you all for standing by our side... We will post something with a little more detail soon. Promise. Love, The Jealous Sound.&quot; Another post confirmed on June 24, 2009, that the band would accompany Sunny Day Real Estate on their 2009 reunion tour.

===&quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot; (2009-onwards)===
The band&#x27;s public status markedly increased following the announcement of a new album. A sporadically updated blog featured updates on the recording sessions, including an announcement that friends of the band, Nate Mendel (Foo Fighters) and Bob Penn (the CoCo B&#x27;s) were due to play bass and drums, respectively, on the new album. Mendel&#x27;s involvement secured the band a year&#x27;s worth of recording and writing time in a studio owned by the Foo Fighters.

In October 2011, Shehan announced that the new album would be called &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot; and was scheduled for a January 2012 release; this was also officially posted on the band&#x27;s Facebook page. The band completed a small promotion tour in December 2011, with a full tour planned for 2012.

&quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot; was released on January 31, 2012. A song from new album, &quot;Your Eyes Were Shining&quot;, was uploaded onto the Jealous Sound&#x27;s SoundCloud website in June 2012.

Following the album&#x27;s release, Benito parted ways with the band and was replaced by Richardson in mid-2012.

In conjunction with a late-2012 American tour in support of &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot;, The Jealous Sound released a split 7-inch recording (each band contributes material to one side of the vinyl record) with tour-mates Daytrader.

====Rise records====
In December 2012, the band announced that it had signed a deal with US-based label Rise Records. The &quot;Alternative Press (magazine)&quot; wrote, &quot;They (Rise Records) will re-release their latest album, &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot;, on February 5th, 2013. The new deluxe version will feature 4 bonus tracks including a new song and the 2008 &quot;Got Friends&quot; EP. The double vinyl LP version will include those as well as 2 remixes of the song “Got Friends” including one by Jimmy Tamborello of The Postal Service.&quot; The band also stated that it was planning to release its next full-length record in 2014.

====Reflections from 2012====
Shehan provided an update of Benito&#x27;s progress in the area of score composition on the band&#x27;s Facebook fan page, stating, &quot;Pedro wrote on the new record but left to pursue a career in film/tv music. He&#x27;s doing really well in the field and keeps tabs on us though. He&#x27;ll be stoked that people are checking up on him...&quot; 
On December 31, 2012, Shehan stated in a brief interview published by the Swimmingly website (an Internet resource identified by the tagline &quot;A generation raised on the ideals of independent music is pioneering a new era in food culture.&quot;):
Quite a good chunk of 2012 was spent traveling America with three other grown men in a 15 passenger van. My dining choices at home in LA are spent at my usual spots, so when I&quot;m on tour I enjoy heading out on my own for some quiet time and hopefully a great meal. It grounds me out and helps me reset from the daily grind of touring.

====&quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot; reissue====
The band&#x27;s website revealed that the reissue of the second album, with Rise Records, consisted of &quot;four previously unreleased songs, five new mixes, and a complete remaster.&quot; The release date for the reissued edition was February 5, 2013. The Rise Records website indicated the availability of a vinyl version of the reissued album, with 500 white and 1000 blue discs produced. A music video of the title track from the second album was released on the same date as the release date of the Rise reissue, and was published on the Rise Records YouTube channel. The video features the band in a woodland setting. New guitarist Richardson plays lead guitar in the video.

===Third album===
In January 2013, Shehan provided his perspective on the follow-up album to &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot;:
It&#x27;s time to get started. I realize that I have to plan for the future. I’m looking forward to making another record. Every record is an evolution but you try new things and you have new tools in your toolbox. If you’re inspired and you can match your new tools with inspiration, then that&#x27;s great. There&#x27;s nothing more depressing than making a bad record or listening to an uninspired record. And you can tell. It&#x27;s pretty immediate. I don&#x27;t want to make a record that feels that way ever. When inspiration meets artistic growth, it&#x27;s great. I’m excited to see what that&#x27;s like.On March 28, 2017, the band announced that they were officially concluded and Blair Shehan and Bob Pen are forming a new band called Racquet Club with Sergie Loobkoff (Samiam, Knapsack) on guitar and Ian Smith on bass.

==Recognition==
Andy Greenwald, of the &quot;Grantland Quarterly&quot;″s podcast, &quot;Hollywood Prospectus&quot;, selected &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot; for his &quot;Best of 2012&quot; list, while the Daytrotter live recording website selected the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Hope For Us&quot; in its 50 &quot;Best Songs of 2012&quot; list, at number six.

==Touring==
According to the Songkick.com website, the Jealous Sound has completed 46 live performances since the band&#x27;s inception; these shows have taken place in the United States.

The Jealous Sound announced a 19-date tour of the US in mid-2012 that would occur that September and October. Previous to this, the band had toured (again, only in the US) in late 2011 and in 2012.

In early August 2012, a Montreal, Canada show was announced; his was the only Canadian show that the band would undertake as part of its North American tour with support band Daytrader.

In November 2012, the band was announced as one of the two support acts on the &quot;Winter Headline Tour 2013&quot; of American band Balance and Composure, with Daylight as the other support act. The domestic American tour was to span from January 2013 to February 2013, with cities such as Pembroke Pines, Florida; Hamden, Connecticut; and Cleveland, Ohio selected as performance locations. On March 28, 2017, The band announced that they were officially finished, with Blair Shehan and Bob Penn forming a new band called Racquet Club.

===In-studio concert performances===
The band recorded two in-studio concert performances following the release of &quot;A Gentle Reminder&quot; — one for the Daytrotter company, in April 2012, and one for the Audiotree company, in February 2013. Both companies are based in the American state of Illinois, with Daytrotter in Rock Island and Audiotree in Chicago. Sean Moeller, writing for the Daytrotter website, provided an accompanying article to the Jealous Sound&#x27;s session:
Shehan finds his pain riveting and it&#x27;s easy to see why. None of the pain that he lends to his Los Angeles-based band is one-dimensional. It&#x27;s all things to all different people. It&#x27;s agony and it&#x27;s euphoria. He howls directly at the anguish, as if he were howling directly at the moon, looking for any way to deaden it, or lessen it, to pry away its grip, just a little bit.

==Management==
The band is managed by Tom Ackerman (formerly of Sunday&#x27;s Best) of Street Smart Management.

<text>Leon Earl Benoit (born July 7, 1950) is a Canadian politician.

== Career ==
Benoit was a Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Vegreville—Wainwright from 2004 to 2015, Lakeland from 1997 to 2004, and Vegreville from 1993 to 1997. He has also been a member of the Canadian Alliance (2000-2003) and the Reform Party of Canada (1993-2000). Benoit is a former economist and farmer. As an Opposition MP, Benoit was the official opposition critic of Public Works and Government Services and the Canadian Wheat Board, Intergovernmental Affairs, Citizenship and Immigration, and National Defence.

In May 2007, when Benoit was the chair of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on International Trade, he was under scrutiny when he adjourned the committee after the opposition overruled him. His move was &quot;unprecedented&quot;. After he abruptly adjourned the committee, the Vice-Chair took over, and the meeting resumed after he and three of the four other Conservative members had left.

The meeting had to do with North American Energy Security. Gordon Laxer presented a talk in which he questioned why Canada&#x27;s oil exports were being used to guarantee US energy security, as opposed to Canada using its energy resources to provide protection for Canadians first and then others. Benoit felt Laxer had not been on topic.

Regarding the Citizen&#x27;s Arrest and Self-Defence Act, Benoit stated that the legislation would expand the circumstances in which citizens can make arrests and simplify the self-defense and defense of property provisions in the Criminal Code.

In 2013, Benoit joined two other Conservative MPs (Saskatchewan MP Maurice Vellacott and Ontario MP Wladyslaw Lizon) in writing a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police requesting a homicide investigation into some late-term abortions that may have resulted in live births. The letter was criticized as an attempt to reopen the abortion debate. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, &quot;I think all members of this House, whether they agree with it or not, understand that abortion is legal in Canada, and this government, myself included, have made it very clear that the government does not intend to change the law in this regard.&quot; In 2017, Benoit endorsed Brad Trost for the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election he was the first MP in 2017 to have endorsed Trost before Maurice Vellacott in April 2017.

<doc id="442546" wikidata="Q161360" url="?curid=442546" title="Chamaecyparis lawsoniana">
<text>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, known as Port Orford cedar or Lawson&#x27;s cypress, is a species of conifer in the genus &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, family Cupressaceae. It is native to Oregon and northwestern California, and grows from sea level up to in the valleys of the Klamath Mountains, often along streams.

== Description ==
A large evergreen tree, specimens mature up to tall or more (exceptionally to ), with trunks in diameter, exceptionally . The bark is silver-brown, vertically furrowed, and thick near the base. The foliage is arranged in lacy, flat sprays with a feathery appearance, usually somewhat glaucous (i.e. blue-green) in color. The leaves are scale-like, long, with narrow white markings on the underside, and produced on somewhat flattened shoots. The foliage gives off a rather pungent scent, not unlike parsley. The seed cones are globose, in diameter, with 6–10 scales, green at first, maturing brown in early fall, 6–8 months after pollination. The male cones are long, dark red, turning brown after pollen release in early spring. The seeds fall quickly and can float on water.

Old specimens lack branches near the base and often have dead tops. They can live up to about 600 years of age.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was first discovered (by European Americans) near Port Orford, Oregon, and introduced into cultivation in 1854 by collectors working for Charles Lawson FRSE of the Lawson &amp; Son nursery in Edinburgh, Scotland, after whom it was named as Lawson&#x27;s Cypress by the describing botanist Andrew Murray. The United States Department of Agriculture officially calls it by the name Port Orford cedar, as do most people in its native area, but some botanists prefer to use the name Lawson&#x27;s cypress (or in very rare instances Port Orford cypress) instead. The name &quot;Lawson&#x27;s cypress&quot; is widely used in horticulture.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to southwestern Oregon and northwestern California, and grows from sea level up to in the valleys of the Klamath Mountains, often along streams. It fares best at the north end of its range.

== Ecology ==
The thick bark provides resistance to wildfires, and the species regenerates well on disrupted land in a variety of soils, but requires consistent moisture. It is shade tolerant, but not so much so as competing species western hemlock and white fir. The old-growth population near Coos Bay, Oregon, was wiped out by logging and wildfires in 1867–1868, and again by fire and root disease in 1936.

=== Disease ===
In the wild, the species is seriously and uniquely threatened by a root disease caused by the oomycete pathogen, &quot;Phytophthora lateralis&quot;, accidentally introduced in the early 1950s following the fungus&#x27;s arrival to the Pacific Northwest on nursery trees. This disease is also a problem for horticultural plantings in some parts of North America. The tree is sometimes killed, though less often, by other species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot;.

&quot;Phytophthora lateralis&quot; infection begins when mycelium, from a germinated spore, invade the roots. The infection then spreads through the inner bark and cambium around the base of the tree. Spread up the trunk is generally limited. Infected tissue dies and effectively girdles the tree. Large trees are more likely to be infected than small trees due to larger root areas (although all trees at the edges of infected streams will eventually succumb). However, large trees can often live with the infections for a longer duration (up to several years).

&quot;C. lawsoniana&quot; in streamside populations are highly susceptible to &quot;P. lateralis&quot; infection. However, the rate of fungal spread through populations in dry upland areas appears to be slow. &quot;P. lateralis&quot; spreads through water via mobile spores (zoospores). The fungus also produces resting spores (chlamydospores) that can persist in soil for a long period of time. New infections generally begin when soil is transferred from an infected population to a non-infected population via water, human or animal movement. After initial infection in streamside populations, secondary spread via zoospores quickly infects all downstream individuals.

Human facilitated spread is thought to be responsible for most new, and all long-distance, infections. Soil on vehicle tires, especially logging trucks and other off-road vehicles, is considered the most pressing problem due to the volume of soil that can be carried and the traffic rate in and between susceptible areas. Spread on boots and mountain bike tires has also been suggested and probably contributes to new infections locally. Animal-facilitated spread is thought to occur, but is localized.

The United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management attempt to prevent &quot;Phytophthora&quot; spread through road closures, monitoring, research and education. Research has focused on determining the dynamics and mechanisms of spread, as well as attempts to breed resistant trees.
One solution against &quot;Phytophtera&quot; is known generically as Mancozeb and also commercially known as Dithane (C).
Commercial preparations of the parasitic fungus &quot;Pythium oligandrum&quot; are licensed for pest control, and documented to predate many species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot;.

=== Similar species ===
The extinct Eocene species &quot;Chamaecyparis eureka&quot;, known from fossils found on Axel Heiberg Island in Canada, is noted as resembling &quot;C. lawsoniana&quot; and &quot;C. pisifera&quot;.

The associated genus &quot;Calocedrus&quot; (incense-cedar) has thick orange-brown bark and the bark of &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; (western redcedar) is comparatively thin; both have different foliage than Port Orford cedar.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot; thrives best in well-drained but moist soils, in a fairly sheltered position in full sun. Several hundred named cultivars of varying crown shape, growth rates and foliage color have been selected for planting in parks and gardens. In the United Kingdom (UK) the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017): 
== Uses ==
The species was discovered by Euro-Americans in the 1850s. The wood is light yet has great strength and rot resistance, even after long exposure to salt water. Its properties resemble those of yellow-cedar, but was historically more available in the region. On shores lacking docks, logs were transported via high-line cable directly onto ship decks. It was valued for boatbuilding. The species was important to Oregon&#x27;s lumber industry until the 1950s when it was crippled by disease. It was preferred for storage battery cell separation, Venetian blinds, and other uses. Quality specimens eventually began to be shipped almost exclusively to East Asia, where it is highly valued. Large amounts have been exported to Japan where it is used in making coffins, shrines, and temples. Its lumber is known for its highly fragrant ginger aroma, caused by an oil which repulses decay and insects, including termites; this oil has been used as an insecticide. Due to the straightness of its grain, it is also one of the preferred woods for the manufacture of arrow shafts. It is also considered an acceptable, though not ideal, wood for construction of aircraft.

The wood is considered more than acceptable for use in stringed instruments. Its fine grain, good strength and tonal quality are highly regarded for soundboards in guitar making.

<doc id="442549" wikidata="Q2716211" url="?curid=442549" title="Yoshi's Safari">
<text>Yoshi&#x27;s Safari is a 1993 light gun shooter developed and published by Nintendo for its Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It is the only &quot;Mario&quot; franchise game to feature first-person shooter gameplay and requires the SNES&#x27;s Super Scope light gun. As Mario and his pet dinosaur Yoshi, the player embarks on a quest to save the kingdom of Jewelry Land from Bowser and his Koopalings, who have kidnapped its rulers and stolen 12 gems. The game features 12 levels in which the player shoots enemies like Goombas and Koopas, and collects power-ups and coins. At the end of each level, the player engages in a boss fight with an enemy, a Koopaling, or Bowser. Nintendo commissioned its R&amp;D1 department to develop &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; in response to the waning popularity of the Super Scope. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; was the first Super Scope title to use the SNES&#x27;s Mode 7 graphics mode, and the future of the peripheral depended on the game&#x27;s performance.

Nintendo released &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; in Japan and North America in late 1993, and in PAL regions the following year. The game received positive reviews from video game journalists, who commended its presentation—particularly the visuals—and gameplay; some labelled it the best Super Scope title. However, it received criticism for its short length and low difficulty level. The game garnered little attention and failed commercially, attributed to its launch coinciding with a controversy surrounding the SNES rerelease of the popular arcade game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992). Most of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; additions to the &quot;Mario&quot; lore were ignored in subsequent games, and it has never been rereleased.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; is a light gun shooter viewed from a first-person perspective. The game features 12 levels and requires the Super Scope, a light gun peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), to be played. The player views gameplay from the perspective of Mario riding on his pet dinosaur Yoshi&#x27;s back and uses the Super Scope to shoot enemies, which include the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise&#x27;s traditional Goombas, Koopas, and Cheep-Cheeps. As the player fires the Super Scope, a power gauge will drop; firing too rapidly will deplete it and cause long pauses between shots, making players more vulnerable to enemy attacks. The game features a multiplayer mode in which one player controls Mario using the Super Scope and another controls Yoshi using an SNES controller. In the single-player mode, Yoshi is controlled automatically.

After selecting a level from the overworld, the player must clear it within a time limit. In addition to enemies, the player shoots blocks with question marks to earn coins, and will earn an extra life by collecting 60. The player loses lives if enemies deplete their health bar, if they fall down a pit with less than three coins, or if they fail to complete the level within the allotted time. Losing all lives results in a game over, forcing the player to restart. The levels feature branching paths leading to different enemies and prizes, though they always end on the same path, which leads to a boss fight. Bosses include the Koopalings piloting giant mechs, bigger versions of normal enemies, and Bowser. Power-ups, such as mushrooms, flowers, and stars, provide the player with extra health, firepower, and invincibility. Some power-ups can only be used during boss battles.

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; is set in Jewelry Land—a location similar to the Mushroom Kingdom—and features a simple story. Series antagonist Bowser and his Koopalings kidnap Jewelry Land rulers King Fret and Prince Pine, and steal the 12 magic gems that protect the kingdom from harm, causing an earthquake that splits it in two. One of the Koopalings, Iggy, designs powerful mechs that aid Bowser&#x27;s army in their invasion. Princess Peach sends Mario and Yoshi on a quest to defeat Bowser, retrieve the gems, and set the two rulers free. When the player completes the game, they will be given a cheat code that, when input at the title screen, increases the difficulty level. The game also has a leaderboard to encourage multiple playthroughs and so players can keep track of their scores.

==Development==

In February 1992, Nintendo released the Super Scope, a successor to its popular NES Zapper for the Nintendo Entertainment System. At the time, Nintendo was in fierce competition with Sega, a company known for its &quot;cool&quot; games and advertising, and needed an edge over this new rival. Unlike its predecessor, the Super Scope was only a moderate success and by 1993 risked fading into obscurity. Nintendo management realized the peripheral&#x27;s relevance was waning and commissioned the company&#x27;s R&amp;D1 department to develop a Super Scope game featuring Mario. The future of the Super Scope depended on the performance of this game. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; was the first Super Scope game to use the SNES&#x27;s Mode 7 graphics mode, which created an impression of 3D computer graphics and made the gameplay more realistic.

Nintendo released &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; in Japan on July 14, 1993 under the title &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Road Hunting&quot;, and in North America the following September. It was released in PAL regions in 1994. The title did not garner much attention upon release. Its North American launch coincided with the rerelease of the popular arcade game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), a game controversial for its violence, for the SNES and Sega&#x27;s Genesis. According to &quot;IGN&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s decision to soften the blood and gore in the SNES version drew public attention away from &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

While &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; failed commercially, which &quot;IGN&quot; attributed to its reliance on the Super Scope and the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; debacle, it did receive praise from video game journalists. The presentation—particularly the visuals—were well received. , &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;), and &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; considered the graphics and smooth scrolling among the game&#x27;s highlights. &quot;Joypad&quot; wrote the animation was fluid and &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; wrote the graphics suited the &quot;Mario&quot; theme, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; called the characters colorful and bright. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the game&#x27;s use of Mode 7, describing the graphics as excellent and colorful. &quot;Joypad&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; both praised the music, with &quot;Joypad&quot; writing it was simple but still sounded good. 

Critics also commended the gameplay, with &quot;Joypad&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; calling &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; the best Super Scope title. &quot;Joypad&quot; praised the multiplayer mode and wrote that while the game was somewhat expensive, it was worth buying for Super Scope owners. The game had more depth than other Super Scope titles, &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; wrote, because of its variety and branching level paths. &quot;Joypad&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; respectively praised the controls as responsive and easy to use. However, the game&#x27;s short length and low difficulty were primary aspects of criticism. &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; reviewers said they finished the entire game in one sitting and estimated it would provide at most a week of entertainment, while &quot;EGM&quot; wrote players &quot;may be tempted to turn your SuperScope on yourself and end it all!&quot; &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; suggested the game was geared toward a younger audience, with the former stating beginning players would find enjoyment but experienced ones would be left wanting more. Power Unlimited gave the game a score of 80%, they found the gameplay to be &quot;original, looks good and is fun to play. Very easy.&quot;

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; failure signified that the Super Scope was commercially nonviable for Nintendo. Mario and Yoshi creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who was working on &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; (1995) at the time, disliked &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; and strove to make his game feel more authentic. Games starring Yoshi did not gain much popularity until &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, and &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; remains relatively obscure. The title&#x27;s additions to the &quot;Mario&quot; lore, such as Jewelry Land, were ignored in subsequent games. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; is notable for being the first &quot;Mario&quot; game to refer to the Princess as &quot;Peach&quot; instead of &quot;Toadstool&quot; in Western territories, although this did not stick until &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996). Nintendo would later revive old games from its back catalog through its Virtual Console service, but &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; has never been rereleased, and &quot;IGN&quot; noted its 25th anniversary passed in 2018 with little fanfare. The game remains the sole first-person shooter in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise.

&quot;IGN&quot; lamented the obscurity of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; in a 2019 retrospective and felt it deserved more recognition, writing the game was and still is a standout in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. The title&#x27;s &quot;quirky aspects&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; wrote—such as its science fiction theme (in contrast to previous &quot;Mario&quot; games&#x27; fantasy one), upbeat music, and use of the Super Scope—paved way for the franchise&#x27;s more experimental games such as &quot;Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&quot; (2017): &quot;while far from perfect, [&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot;] was still ahead of its time in certain regards.&quot; The writer also called it &quot;a shame&quot; the game has never been rereleased.

<text>Remipedia is a class of blind crustaceans, closely related to hexapods, found in coastal aquifers which contain saline groundwater, with populations identified in almost every ocean basin so far explored, including in Australia, the Caribbean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean. The first described remipede was the fossil &quot;Tesnusocaris goldichi&quot; (Lower Pennsylvanian). Since 1979, at least seventeen living species have been identified in subtropical regions around the world.

==Description==
Remipedes are long and comprise a head and an elongate trunk of up to thirty-two similar body segments. Pigmentation and eyes are absent. Biramous swimming appendages are laterally present on each segment. The animals swim on their backs and are generally slow-moving. They are the only known venomous crustaceans, and have fangs connected to secretory glands, which inject a combination of digestive enzymes and venom into their prey, but they also feed through filter feeding. Being hermaphrodites, the female pore is located on the seventh trunk segment and the male pore on the fourteenth.

Remipedia have a generally primitive body plan compared to other extant crustaceans, and are the only extant pancrustaceans to lack significant postcephalic tagmosis. External respiratory structures like gills are absent. Previously regarded as &#x27;primitive&#x27;, Remipedia have since been shown to have enhanced olfactory nerve centers (a common feature for species that live in dark environments).

Based on studies of the free-living larvae, they appear to be lecithotrophic (non-feeding). Mouths, guts, and anuses appear in the juvenile stage. Because of the energy and nutrients required for swimming, molting, and to grow in size and length, it has been speculated that the larvae may have other sources of growth than its yolk; possibly symbiotic bacteria.

With the exception of &quot;Speleonectes kakuki&quot;, which inhabits a fully marine, sub-seafloor cave in the Bahamas, all known species of remipedians have been found exclusively in anchialine cave systems.

== History of classification ==
The first species in this group to be described was &quot;Speleonectes lucayensis&quot;, discovered by Jill Yager while cave diving in Lucayan Caverns on the Grand Bahama Island in 1979 and described in a paper in the &quot;Journal of Crustacean Biology&quot; in 1981. The novel nature of this species was recognized and the class Remipedia was erected in the same paper. The name &quot;Remipedia&quot; is from the Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;oar-footed&quot;.

Historical phylogeny based on morphology and physiology has placed Remipedia under Mandibulata, in the subphylum Crustacea, and distinct from Hexapoda.

New research in evolution and development reveals similarities between larvae and postembryonic development of remipedes and Malacostraca, singling Remipedia as a potential crustacean sister group of Hexapoda. Similarities in brain anatomy further support this affinity, and hexapod-type hemocyanins have been discovered in remipedes.

Recent molecular studies have grouped Remipedia with Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, and Hexapoda in a clade named Allotriocarida. Remipedia was found as the sister group to Hexapoda both in phylogenomic and combined morphological and transcriptome studies. In other studies Remipedia and Cephalocarida are grouped together form the clade Xenocarida, which in turn was sister to Hexapoda in a clade named Anartiopoda or Miracrustacea (&#x27;surprising crustaceans&#x27;). 

The relationship of Remipedia and other crustacean classes and insects is shown in the following phylogenetic tree, which shows Allotriocarida, along with Oligostraca and Multicrustacea, as the three main divisions of subphylum Pancrustacea, embracing the traditional crustaceans and the hexapods (including insects).

==Classification==

Thirty extant species are recognized as of early 2022, divided among eight families and twelve genera. All are placed in the order Nectiopoda. The second order, Enantiopoda, comprises the fossil species &quot;Tesnusocaris goldichi&quot; and &quot;Cryptocaris hootchi&quot;.

<text>Johnny Speight (2 June 1920 – 5 July 1998) was an English television scriptwriter of many classic British sitcoms.

Speight emerged in the mid-1950s, writing for radio comics Frankie Howerd, Vic Oliver, Arthur Askey, and Cyril Fletcher. For television he wrote for Morecambe &amp; Wise, Peter Sellers and &quot;The Arthur Haynes Show&quot;. Later, he began to write &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, which included his most famous creation, the controversial bigot Alf Garnett. His shows often explored the themes of racism and sexism through satire.

==Life and career==
John Speight was born into an Irish Catholic family in Canning Town, West Ham, Essex (now Greater London). He left school at 14, and after a series of odd jobs, tried his hand at writing, looking to George Bernard Shaw as inspiration. He began contributing scripts to comedy shows in 1955, starting with &quot;Great Scott - It&#x27;s Maynard!&quot;. He later contributed to &quot;Sykes and a...&quot; (1960–65), which starred Eric Sykes, Hattie Jacques and Richard Wattis. Speight was one of many writers on that series which also included Sykes, John Antrobus and Spike Milligan. He created the iconic working class tramp figure played by Arthur Haynes in the latter&#x27;s long-running and top-rating ATV comedy series. Haynes died in 1966.

In 1965, Speight wrote a BBC TV pilot which became the 1966 series &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; featuring Warren Mitchell as Alf Garnett, a reactionary Conservative-voting working-class man with a chip on his shoulder and an angry word on everything. Garnett became one of the most memorable characters in British TV history. The 1971 US sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot; was based on this series. Also in 1965, he did uncredited screenplay work for the film &quot;You Must be Joking!&quot;. Speight also played &quot;Barmey Harry&quot; in the second film spin-off, &quot;The Alf Garnett Saga&quot;, in 1972 .

Speight&#x27;s later series &quot;Curry and Chips&quot; (1969) was a more controversial sitcom from LWT for the ITV channel, soon cancelled on the instructions of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. His next comedy was &quot;For Richer...For Poorer&quot; (1975), a one-off pilot which featured Harry H. Corbett as a left-wing answer to Alf Garnett. After a brief return of &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; on ITV in 1981 as &quot;Till Death...&quot;, Alf Garnett returned on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot; which ran from 1985 to 1992. In 1985, he wrote the unbroadcast pilot &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; starring Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes, with Milligan wearing blackface and making racially charged jokes, while adopting a Pakistani accent.

In 1988 Speight wrote a set of special short sketches for inclusion in London&#x27;s Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI) in a feature called &quot;Ask Alf&quot;. Using random access video visitors were invited to ask Alf Garnett his thoughts on a variety of subjects including museums. Warren Mitchell recorded the short sketches free of charge for MOMI while on tour in Australia.

Speight&#x27;s work brought him financial success, but despite driving a Rolls-Royce he remained a life-long socialist.

He was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in May 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

==Death==
In 1998, Speight died of pancreatic cancer, aged 78 at his home in Chorleywood. LWT put forward a series of specials featuring Warren Mitchell as Alf Garnett, giving his thoughts on a variety of subjects. The programmes were originally shelved by ITV controller David Liddiment.

<text>Quincy, M.E. (also called Quincy) is an American mystery medical drama television series from Universal Studios that was broadcast on NBC from October 3, 1976, to May 11, 1983. Jack Klugman starred in the title role as a Los Angeles County medical examiner who routinely engages in police investigations.

Inspired by the book &quot;Where Death Delights&quot; by Marshall Houts, a former FBI agent, the show also resembled the earlier Canadian television series &quot;Wojeck&quot;, broadcast by CBC Television. John Vernon, who played the &quot;Wojeck&quot; title role, later guest-starred in the third-season episode &quot;Requiem for the Living&quot;. Quincy&#x27;s character is loosely modeled on Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;Coroner to the Stars&quot; Thomas Noguchi.

&quot;Quincy&quot; was originally broadcast as 90-minute telefilms as part of the &quot;NBC Sunday Mystery Movie&quot; rotation in the autumn of 1976, alongside &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot; and &quot;McMillan&quot; (formerly &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;). The series proved popular enough that after four episodes of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; were broadcast during the 1976–1977 season in the extended format, &quot;Quincy&quot; was spun off into its own weekly one-hour series without a typical 60-minute pilot. Instead, a two-hour episode kicked off a thirteen-episode shortened run of the series, which concluded the 1976–1977 season, while NBC canceled the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; format in the spring of 1977.

The &quot;Quincy&quot; series often used the same actors for different roles in various episodes, a frequent occurrence on many Glen A. Larson TV programs. Writers Lou Shaw and Tony Lawrence received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1978 for the second-season episode &quot;...The Thigh Bone&#x27;s Connected to the Knee Bone...&quot;.

==Synopsis==

The series starred Jack Klugman as Dr. Quincy, a resolute, excitable, ethical and highly proficient Medical Examiner (forensic pathologist) for the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office, working to ascertain facts about and reasons for possible suspicious deaths. His colleagues, friends and wife all address him by his surname or the shortened &quot;Quince”. The character&#x27;s first name was never given, although in the third-season episode &quot;Accomplice to Murder”, his name is shown on a business card as &quot;R. Quincy&quot;; and in early episodes, the name &quot;Dr. R. Quincy&quot; appears on his office door. (It appears not even Klugman himself knew what Quincy&#x27;s first name was supposed to have been; whenever he was asked, he would reply &quot;Doctor!&quot;)

While engaged in para-police investigations, Quincy frequently comes into conflict with his boss, Dr. Robert Asten (John S. Ragin), and the police, in particular, LAPD Homicide Lieutenant Frank Monahan (Garry Walberg). Quincy and Asten would usually tussle about halfway into an episode, after which time Quincy would successfully solve the case, outsmarting the LAPD and his argumentative boss. Both Monahan and Asten frequently had their own theories about a particular case which were usually at odds with Quincy&#x27;s deductions. In early episodes, Quincy&#x27;s relationship with both men was often volatile and nearly adversarial; this changed markedly in later episodes, where Quincy appears to have much closer professional and personal relationships with the two. Frequently, however, the entire investigation would be handled by Quincy with little or no cooperation from the police. Quincy is assisted in the lab by the faithful and adept Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito).

It is revealed in the episode &quot;The Last of Leadbottom&quot; that Quincy is a retired Captain in the US Navy and remains in the Naval Reserve. In the episode &quot;Crib Job”, he notes he originally wanted to be a railroad engineer, after revealing a number of facts about the dangers of the occupation. A well-liked man, Quincy lives on a sailboat permanently moored in Marina Del Rey, California, and frequents Danny&#x27;s, a restaurant and lounge at the marina owned by his friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio).

Quincy is quite successful with women. He was once married, but lost his wife, Helen, to cancer. In the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; installments and earliest first-season episodes, Quincy has a regular girlfriend, an airline flight attendant named Lee Potter (portrayed by Lynnette Mettey) who sometimes accompanies him on his cases (such as in &quot;...The Thighbone&#x27;s Connected to the Knee Bone...&quot;). After Lee, Quincy dated several women until near the end of the seventh season, when he remarries (Dr. Emily Hanover, played by Anita Gillette who had previously portrayed Helen in a flashback) and sells the sailboat in the episode &quot;Quincy&#x27;s Wedding”.

Quincy occasionally drives an antique car (which is shown in Season 4, Episode 1 to be an antique Packard Town Car), but friends sometimes ask why he drives his &quot;work car&quot; (the county coroner&#x27;s removal vehicle, a 1976 AMC Matador station wagon (California reg plate: 999853) in the first two seasons and a 1975 Ford LTD station wagon for the rest of the series) on his day off. In reply to the queries, Quincy claims that his car is being repaired.

As originally conceived as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; format, the early seasons of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; contained elements of whodunit or howcatchem and focused primarily on Quincy&#x27;s own criminal investigation; a typical episode would find Quincy determining the actual murderer (instead of the LAPD) or the true cause of a suspicious or unusual death. Later seasons&#x27; episodes began to introduce themes of social responsibilities; Quincy would find himself conducting his own para-police investigation that reveals situations such as a disreputable plastic surgeon and the reasons his botched surgeries are not stopped, flaws in drunk driving laws, lax airline safety, dumping of hazardous waste, the proliferation of handguns, autism, anorexia nervosa, hazing, teenage alcoholism, Tourette&#x27;s syndrome, orphan drugs and an infamous episode about the dangers of Punk Rock.

&quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, was one of the first American dramatic series to use a format like this to further a social agenda. Klugman himself even came to testify before the US Congress about some of these issues (such as orphan drugs in 1982), describing what he had learned about a difficult or complex social concern as a result of its use in one of the show&#x27;s episodes.

In 2008, Klugman sued NBC, asserting that the network had concealed profits from the show which were owed to him.

==Legacy and influence==
The Canadian series &quot;Wojeck&quot; (1966-68) and especially the British series &quot;The Expert&quot; (1968-76) were centered around forensic investigators and routinely showed detailed forensic investigations long before &quot;Quincy&quot; was even conceived. However, American TV had not explored this genre of storytelling; while many American detective series had depicted rudimentary physical evidence analysis such as fingerprints and bullet comparisons, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; was the first American series to regularly present the in-depth forensic investigations which would be the hallmark of later detective shows such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, et al. Klugman appeared twice on &quot;&quot;, as, respectively, Dr. Jeff Everden and Det. Harry Trumble, and once on &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; as Dr. Leo Gelber.

==Cast==
A total of 148 episodes of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; were produced, with Jack Klugman appearing in all but one of them. In &quot;Has Anybody Here Seen Quincy?&quot; (season 2, episode 7), Dr. Asten talks to Quincy twice on the phone, but Quincy&#x27;s voice is not heard, and he is never seen on screen. Klugman refused to appear in this episode because he disliked a scene when a body delivered to the morgue turns out to still be living. Klugman thought it ludicrous that a medical examiner of Quincy&#x27;s expertise would fail to notice it.

Conversely, Klugman was the only regular cast member who appeared in the final episode of the series (&quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;), which was a backdoor pilot for a proposed series about a revolutionary new clinic. NBC did not pick up the new series, however.

Eddie Garrett portrayed a forensic photographer in approximately 113 episodes of the series. Joseph Roman appeared as Sgt. Brill, Lt. Monahan&#x27;s partner. Marc Scott Taylor, technical advisor for the series beginning in season four, also appeared in the recurring role of Mark, a lab technician. John Nolan also played the recurring role of John the bartender in 86 episodes. Jonathan Segal played the recurring role of the laboratory technician Jeff Sellers.

Anita Gillette portrayed both of Quincy&#x27;s wives. Until marrying Dr. Emily Hanover near the end of the series, Quincy had been a widower, having lost his first wife, Helen, before the events of the series. Anita Gillette was cast as the late Helen Quincy for the flashback scenes in the episode, &quot;Promises to Keep&quot;, before being hired as Dr. Hanover.

==Home media==
Universal Studios has released Seasons 1 and 2 of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. Season 3 was released in Region 1 on June 2, 2009, four years after the release of Seasons 1 and 2.

On September 7, 2012, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1. It subsequently released seasons 4 – 8 on DVD.

In June 2011, Madman Entertainment announced that it had acquired the distribution rights to the series in Region 4. It subsequently released seasons 3 – 5 on DVD.

The DVDs separate the 90-minute and 60-minute episodes into first and second seasons, although they aired during the same broadcast season (1976–1977). Traditionally, the 1977–1978 season was considered the second, etc.

In 2013, Acorn Media acquired the rights to the series in Region 2. It released season 3 on March 4, 2013.

== Episodes ==

==International broadcasts==
===United States===
The series is currently running in a late evening and early morning slot on Get TV.

===Canada===
The series was first broadcast nationally in Canada in 1976 on CBC.

===Australia===
&quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; currently airs on the Seven Network&#x27;s digital-only channel 7mate daily at 11 am and 3 am.

===United Kingdom===
The series was first broadcast nationally in the United Kingdom in 1977 on the ITV network (albeit at differing times due to the then regional structure of the network). Repeats of the full series were initially shown on BBC1 on afternoons in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and between the late 1990s and early 2010 it frequently ran daily on ITV and (more recently) ITV3, in various time slots—usually 8 a.m., 2 p.m., and early morning. The show was shown on Universal Channel, with episodes on Sunday morning, and one episode at 8 a.m. (repeating at 4 p.m. and 5 a.m. the following morning) through the week. After a brief appearance on YourTV in the daytime, &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot; appeared last as a twice-daily run on ITV4 from May 2016 to July 2020 (afternoon and repeated the following morning). The series was normally billed in TV listings magazines as simply &quot;Quincy&quot;, as in the UK a medical examiner is called a forensic scientist; and it was felt the &quot;M.E.&quot; acronym would be unfamiliar to British viewers.

===Japan===
&quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; has aired on the TV Asahi network since 1979. Tsuneyuki Serizawa, who supervised the Japanese edition, was a friend of Thomas Noguchi. &quot;Doctor Detective Quincy&quot; was the Japanese title.

===Germany===
Thirteen episodes were first aired from 1981 through 1983 by the public broadcaster ARD. Then, in the early 1990s, 133 episodes were aired by the commercial television station RTL. Since April 2010, kabel eins has aired the first five seasons on weekdays. In 2012 and 2013, the episodes were aired by the RTL partner station RTL Nitro. Since 2015 they have been broadcast by Sat.1 Gold, a partner station of kabel eins. All episodes shown on German TV are dubbed into German.

===Italy===
The series appeared in Italy in the mid-1980s on the TV channel Italia 1. The first four episodes have never been dubbed into Italian; hence they have never been aired on TV, and can be found only (with subtitles) in DVDs. Moreover, many episodes were shortened to about 50 minutes for the Italian version.

<doc id="442568" wikidata="Q330803" url="?curid=442568" title="After the Fox">
<text>After the Fox () is a 1966 heist comedy film directed by Vittorio De Sica and starring Peter Sellers, Victor Mature and Britt Ekland. The English-language screenplay was written by Neil Simon and De Sica&#x27;s longtime collaborator Cesare Zavattini.

Despite its notable credits, the film was poorly received when it was released but has since gained a cult following for its numerous in-jokes skewering movie stars, starstruck audiences, pretentious film critics and pompous directors, including Cecil B. DeMille, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni and De Sica. The film was remade in 2010 in Hindi as &quot;Tees Maar Khan&quot;.

==Plot==
Outside of Cairo, criminal mastermind Okra hijacks $3 million in gold bullion. The thieves now need a way to smuggle the two tons of gold into Europe. Aldo Vanucci, a master of disguise known as The Fox, is one of the few men who can handle the assignment, but he is in prison, and reluctant to accept the job for fear of disgracing his mother and young sister Gina. When his three sidekicks inform him that Gina does not always come home after school, an enraged, overprotective Vanucci vows to escape. He impersonates the prison doctor and flees to Rome with the aid of his gang. There, his mother tells him Gina is working on the street, which Vanucci takes to mean prostitution. But Gina is merely acting in a low-budget film shooting on the Via Veneto. Vanucci realizes the smuggling job will improve his family&#x27;s life. He contacts Okra and agrees to smuggle the gold into Italy for half of the take.

After watching a crowd mob over-the-hill American matinée idol Tony Powell, it strikes Vanucci that movie stars and film crews are idolized and have free rein in society. This insight forms the basis of his plan. Posing as Italian neo-realist director Federico Fabrizi, he plots to bring the gold ashore as a scene in an avant-garde film. To give the picture legitimacy, he cons Powell to star in the film, which is blatantly titled &quot;The Gold of Cairo&quot; (a play on De Sica&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;The Gold of Naples&quot;). Powell&#x27;s agent, Harry, is wary of Fabrizi, but his vain client wants to do the film. Fabrizi casts Gina in the film and enlists the starstruck population of Sevalio, a tiny fishing village, to unload the shipment. But when the boat carrying the gold is delayed, Fabrizi must improvise scenes for his phony film to maintain the ruse.

The ship finally arrives, and the townspeople unload the gold, but Okra double-crosses Vanucci and drives off with the loot. A slapstick car chase ensues and Okra, Vanucci and the police crash into each other. Vanucci, Tony, Gina, Okra and the villagers are accused of smuggling contraband. Vanucci&#x27;s &quot;film&quot; is shown as evidence in court, where a film critic proclaims the disjointed footage a masterpiece. But Vanucci confesses his guilt, exonerating the villagers, but vows to escape prison again. He does so by impersonating the prison doctor again, but when he attempts to remove his fake beard, Vanucci discovers the beard is real and exclaims, &quot;The wrong man has escaped!&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
This was Neil Simon&#x27;s first screenplay; at that time, he had three hit shows running on Broadway — &quot;Little Me&quot;, &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. Simon originally wanted to write a spoof of art-house films such as &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; and the Michelangelo Antonioni films, but the story evolved into the idea of a film-within-a-film. In his 1996 memoir &quot;Rewrites&quot;, Simon recalled that an agent suggested Peter Sellers for the lead, while Simon preferred casting &quot;an authentic Italian&quot; such as Marcello Mastroianni or Vittorio Gassman. Sellers loved the script and asked Vittorio De Sica to direct.

De Sica&#x27;s interest in the project surprised Simon, who at first dismissed it as a way for the director to support his gambling habit. But De Sica saw an opportunity to make a social statement about how the pursuit of money corrupts even the arts. Simon believed that De Sica also relished the opportunity to take potshots at the Italian film industry. De Sica insisted that Simon collaborate with Cesare Zavattini. Since neither spoke the other&#x27;s language, the two writers worked through interpreters. Simon wrote, &quot;He had very clear, concise, and intelligent comments that I could readily understand and agree with.&quot; Still, Simon worried that inserting social statements into what he considered a broad farce would not do justice to either. Yet, &quot;After The Fox&quot; does touch on themes found in De Sica&#x27;s earlier work, namely those of disillusion and dignity.

Sellers said that his main reason for making the film was the chance to work with De Sica. &quot;After the Fox&quot; was the first film produced by Sellers&#x27; new Brookfield production company, which he had formed in partnership with John Bryan, a former production designer. It was also their last production, as Sellers and Bryan had a rift over De Sica. Sellers complained that the director &quot;thinks in Italian; I think in English&quot; and wanted De Sica replaced, but Bryan resisted for financial and artistic reasons. De Sica grew impatient with Sellers and did not like Sellers&#x27; performance or Simon&#x27;s screenplay.

Victor Mature, who had retired from films five years earlier, was lured back to the screen by the prospect of parodying himself as Tony Powell. A clip from Mature&#x27;s 1949 film &quot;Easy Living&quot; (in which he plays an aging football star) appears in the film. He agreed to make &quot;After The Fox&quot; after a receiving a call from Sellers. Mature also revealed that he based Tony Powell partially on De Sica &quot;... plus a lot of egotism, and DeMille, too — that bit with the fellow following him around with the chair all the time.&quot; Mature told the &quot;Chicago Tribune:&quot; &quot;I not only enjoyed doing the film, but it gave me the urge to get back into pictures. They were an exciting group of people to work with.&quot;

According to Simon, Sellers demanded that his wife Britt Ekland be cast as Gina, the Fox&#x27;s sister. Ekland&#x27;s Nordic looks and accent were wrong for the role, but to keep Sellers happy, De Sica acquiesced. Simon recalled that Ekland worked hard on the film. Sellers and Ekland made one other film together, &quot;The Bobo&quot; (1967).

Akim Tamiroff appears as Okra, the mastermind of the heist in Cairo. Tamiroff had been working on and off for Orson Welles playing Sancho Panza in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, a film that Welles never finished. Martin Balsam plays Tony&#x27;s dyspeptic agent Harry. Maria Grazia Buccella appears as Okra&#x27;s voluptuous accomplice. Buccella was a former Miss Italy (1959) and placed third in the Miss Europe pageant. She had been considered for the role of Domino in &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Lydia Brazzi, the wife of actor Rossano Brazzi, was hand-picked by De Sica for the role of the Fox&#x27;s mother, despite her protests that she was not an actress. Lando Buzzanca appears as the chief of police in Sevalio. Simon recalled that the Italian supporting cast learned their English lines phonetically.

The film&#x27;s budget was $3 million, which included the construction of a replica of Rome&#x27;s most famous street, the Via Veneto, on the Cinecittà lot, and location filming in the village of Sant&#x27;Angelo on Ischia in the Bay of Naples. The Sevalio sequences were shot during the height of the tourist season. Reportedly, the villagers of Sant&#x27;Angelo were so busy accommodating tourists that they had no time to appear in the film; extras were brought in from a neighboring village.

Simon lamented that De Sica insisted on using his own film editors, who did not speak English and did not understand the jokes. The film was later recut in Rome by one of John Huston&#x27;s favorite film editors, Russell Lloyd, but Simon believed that more funny bits &quot;are lying in a cutting room in Italy,&quot; possibly including a deleted scene in which Vanucci impersonates one of the Beatles. The voices and accents of the Italian comic actors were dubbed in London, mainly by Robert Rieti, and edited in Rome by Malcolm Cooke, who had been a post-sync dialogue editor on &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

Simon summed up his opinion of the film: &quot;[T]o give the picture its due, it was funny in spots, innovative in its plot, and was well-intentioned. But a hit picture? Uh-uh ... Still today, &quot;After the Fox&quot; remains a cult favorite.&quot;

Burt Bacharach composed the score and cowrote the title song with lyricist Hal David. For the Italian release, the score was composed by Piero Piccioni. The title song &quot;After the Fox&quot; was recorded by the Hollies with Sellers in August 1966 and released by United Artists as a single (b/w &quot;The Fox-Trot&quot;).

==Release==
&quot;After the Fox&quot; was released in Great Britain, Italy and the United States in December 1966. As part of a publicity barrage, United Artists announced that it had signed Federico Fabrizi to direct three films. The story was to be planted in the trade papers and then appear in general newspapers, with Sellers available for telephone interviews in character as Fabrizi. The editors of &quot;Daily Variety&quot; recognized the fictional name immediately and spoiled the gag.

==Influence==
The scene in which Okra speaks to Aldo through the beautiful Maria Grazia Buccella inspired a similar scene in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), in which Austin Powers talks to Foxxy Cleopatra through the Nathan Lane character.

The 2010 Bollywood film &quot;Tees Maar Khan&quot; is an authorized remake.

==Reception and legacy== 
The film was poorly received when it was released and earned mixed reviews. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty much of a mess, this picture. Yes, you&#x27;d think it was done by amateurs.&quot;

The &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer thought that &quot;Peter Sellers is in nimble, lively form in this wacky comedy which, though sometimes strained, has a good comic idea and gives the star plenty of scope for his usual range of impersonations.&quot;

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the film &quot;funny, fast and wholly ridiculous&quot; and thought Sellers&#x27; portrayal of Fabrizi &quot;hilarious.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; called the film &quot;a series of fun-filled satires ... guaranteed for laughs&quot; and thought that Sellers was &quot;at his droll best&quot; and Mature &quot;hilarious.&quot;

&quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Continuing the De Sica&#x27;s decline of recent years, this witless comedy of incompetent crooks and excitable Italians never even begins to get off the ground&quot; and called Seller&#x27;s performance &quot;self-indulgent,&quot; but singled out Mature as &quot;amusing and touching.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 78% approval rating with an average rating of 5.9 out of 10, based on reviews from 9 critics.

The film has some kinship with &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, which was released the previous year and also starred Sellers. That film was the first written by Woody Allen, who, like Neil Simon, had been a staff writer for Sid Caesar. Even the advertising tagline on the posters and trailer for &quot;After The Fox&quot; proclaimed, &quot;You Caught The Pussycat ... Now Chase The Fox!&quot;. The poster art for both films was illustrated by Frank Frazetta.

It has since gained a cult following for its numerous in-jokes skewering movie stars, starstruck audiences, pretentious film critics and pompous directors, including Cecil B. DeMille, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni and De Sica.

The film was remade in 2010 in Hindi as &quot;Tees Maar Khan&quot;.

<text>Phytophthora (from Greek (&quot;phytón&quot;), &quot;plant&quot; and (), &quot;destruction&quot;; &quot;the plant-destroyer&quot;) is a genus of plant-damaging oomycetes (water molds), whose member species cause economic losses on crops worldwide, as well as environmental damage in natural ecosystems. The cell wall of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; is made up of cellulose. The genus was first described by Heinrich Anton de Bary in 1875. Approximately 210 species have been described, although 100–500 undiscovered &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species are estimated to exist.

==Pathogenicity==

&quot;Phytophthora&quot; spp. are mostly pathogens of dicotyledons, and many are relatively host-specific parasites. &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot;, though, infects thousands of species ranging from club mosses, ferns, cycads, conifers, grasses, lilies, to members of many dicotyledonous families. Many species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; are plant pathogens of considerable economic importance. &quot;P. infestans&quot; was the infective agent of the potato blight that caused the Great Famine of Ireland, and still remains the most destructive pathogen of solanaceous crops, including tomato and potato. The soya bean root and stem rot agent, &quot;P. sojae&quot;, caused longstanding problems for the agricultural industry. In general, plant diseases caused by this genus are difficult to control chemically, thus the growth of resistant cultivars is the main management strategy. Other important &quot;Phytophthora&quot; diseases are:

* &quot;P. agathidicida&quot;—causes collar-rot on New Zealand kauri (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;), New Zealand&#x27;s most voluminous tree, an otherwise successful survivor of the Jurassic
* &quot;P. cactorum&quot;—causes rhododendron root rot affecting rhododendrons, azaleas, and orchids, and causes bleeding canker in hardwood trees
* &quot;P. capsici&quot;—infects Cucurbitaceae fruits, such as cucumbers and squash
* &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot;—causes cinnamon root rot affecting forest and fruit trees, and woody ornamentals including arborvitaee, azalea, Chamaecyparis, dogwood, forsythia, Fraser fir, hemlock, Japanese holly, juniper, Pieris, rhododendron, Taxus, white pine, American chestnut and Australian woody plants, especially eucalypt and banksia.
* &quot;P. citricola&quot;—causes root rot and stem cankers in citrus trees
* &quot;P. fragariae&quot;—causes red root rot affecting strawberries
* &quot;P. infestans&quot; causes the serious disease known as potato (late) blight: responsible for the Great Famine of Ireland.
* &quot;P. kernoviae&quot;—pathogen of beech and rhododendron, also occurring on other trees and shrubs including oak, and holm oak. First seen in Cornwall, UK, in 2003.
* &quot;P. lateralis&quot;—causes cedar root disease in Port Orford cedar trees
* &quot;P. megakarya&quot;—one of the cocoa black pod disease species, is invasive and probably responsible for the greatest cocoa crop loss in Africa
* &quot;P. multivora&quot;—discovered in analysis of isolates with &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot; dieback infections of tuart forests of Southwest Australia, which were previously diagnosed as &quot;P. citricola&quot;. The species was found occurring on many other taxa, so named &quot;multivora&quot;.
* &quot;P. nicotianae&quot;—infects tobacco and onions
* &quot;P. palmivora&quot;—causes fruit rot in coconuts and betel nuts
* &quot;P. ramorum&quot;—infects over 60 plant genera and over 100 host species; causes sudden oak death
* &quot;P. quercina&quot;—causes oak death
* &quot;P. sojae&quot;—causes soybean root rot

Research beginning in the 1990s placed some of the responsibility for European forest die-back on the activity of imported Asian &quot;Phytophthoras&quot;.

In 2019, scientists in Connecticut were conducting experiments testing various methods to grow healthier Fraser trees when they accidentally discovered a new species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, which they called &quot;P. abietivora&quot;. The fact that these scientists so readily discovered a new species further suggests that there could be many more species waiting to be discovered.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Phytophthora&quot; species may reproduce sexually or asexually. In many species, sexual structures have never been observed, or have only been observed in laboratory matings. In homothallic species, sexual structures occur in single culture. Heterothallic species have mating strains, designated as A1 and A2. When mated, antheridia introduce gametes into oogonia, either by the oogonium passing through the antheridium (amphigyny) or by the antheridium attaching to the proximal (lower) half of the oogonium (paragyny), and the union producing oospores. Like animals, but not like most true fungi, meiosis is gametic, and somatic nuclei are diploid.
Asexual (mitotic) spore types are chlamydospores, and sporangia which produce zoospores. Chlamydospores are usually spherical and pigmented, and may have a thickened cell wall to aid in their role as a survival structure. Sporangia may be retained by the subtending hyphae (noncaducous) or be shed readily by wind or water tension (caducous) acting as dispersal structures. Also, sporangia may release zoospores, which have two unlike flagella which they use to swim towards a host plant.

Zoospores (and zoospores of &quot;Pythium&quot;, also in the Peronosporales) recognize not only hosts but particular locations on hosts. &quot;Phytophthora&quot; zoospores recognize and attach to specific root surface regions. This is a high degree of specificity at an early stage of cell development.

== Evolution and resemblance to fungi ==
&quot;Phytophthora&quot; is sometimes referred to as a fungus-like organism, but it is classified under a different clade altogether: SAR supergroup (Harosa) (also under Stramenopila and previously under Chromista). This is a good example of convergent evolution: &quot;Phytophthora&quot; is morphologically very similar to true fungi yet its evolutionary history is completely distinct. In contrast to fungi, SAR supergroup is more closely related to plants than to animals. Whereas fungal cell walls are made primarily of chitin, &quot;Phytophthora&quot; cell walls are constructed mostly of cellulose. Ploidy levels are different between these two groups; &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species have diploid (paired) chromosomes in the vegetative (growing, nonreproductive) stage of life, whereas fungi are almost always haploid in this stage. Biochemical pathways also differ, notably the highly conserved lysine synthesis path..

<doc id="442584" wikidata="Q358317" url="?curid=442584" title="Victor Mature">
<text>Victor John Mature (January 29, 1913 – August 4, 1999) was an American stage, film, and television actor who was a leading man in Hollywood during the 1940s and 1950s. His best known film roles include &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940), &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947), &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953). He also appeared in many musicals opposite such stars as Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable.

==Early life==
Mature was born in Louisville, Kentucky. His father, Marcello Gelindo Maturi, later Marcellus George Mature, was a cutler and knife sharpener from Pinzolo, in the Italian part of the former County of Tyrol (now Trentino in Italy, but at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). His mother, Clara P. (Ackley), was Kentucky-born and of Swiss heritage. An older brother, Marcellus Paul Mature, died of osteomyelitis in 1918 at age 11. His only sister, Isabelle, was born and died in 1906. Mature attended St. Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky, the Kentucky Military Institute, and the Spencerian Business School. He briefly sold candy and operated a restaurant before moving to California.

==Career==
===Pasadena Playhouse===
Mature studied and acted at the Pasadena Community Playhouse. For three years, he lived in a tent in the back yard of Mrs Willigan, the mother of a fellow student, Catherine Lewis. He was spotted by Charles R. Rogers, an agent for Hal Roach, while acting in a production of &quot;To Quito and Back&quot;. Rogers called him &quot;a rival to Clark Gable, Robert Taylor and Errol Flynn.&quot; Mature signed a seven-year contract with Roach in September 1939.

===Hal Roach===
Roach cast Mature in a small role in &quot;The Housekeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1939), for which one reviewer called him &quot;a handsome Tarzan type&quot;. Roach then gave Mature his first leading role, as a fur-clad caveman in &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940). The film was highly publicized and it raised Mature&#x27;s profile; Hedda Hopper called him &quot;a sort of miniature Johnny Weissmuller&quot;. Roach next put him in a swashbuckler set during the War of 1812, &quot;Captain Caution&quot; (1940).

Because Hal Roach only made a handful of movies every year, he loaned out Mature&#x27;s services to RKO, who used him as a leading man in the Anna Neagle–Herbert Wilcox musical, &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. The studio people were so pleased with his performance that they bought an option to take over half of Mature&#x27;s contract with Hal Roach, enabling them to draw on his services for two films a year over three years. Wilcox wanted to reunite Mature with Neagle in &quot;Sunny&quot;. Roach announced Mature would support Victor McLaglen in &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;, but Mature was not cast in the final film.

===&quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;===
Mature was worried about the direction of his career at this stage, claiming &quot;nobody was going to believe I could do anything except grunt and groan,&quot; so he went to New York City to try the theatre. He signed to appear in a play with the Group Theatre, &quot;Retreat to Pleasure&quot; by Irwin Shaw. Shortly afterward it was announced he would appear instead in the musical &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; with a book by Moss Hart and songs from Ira Gershwin and Kurt Weill; Mature played Randy Curtis, a film star boyfriend of the show&#x27;s protagonist, magazine editor Liza Elliott (Gertrude Lawrence). Mature later described his role:

First, this secretary came out saying &#x27;What a beautiful hunk of man!&#x27; Then Danny Kaye topped that with a long, long introductory number. Finally, I made my entrance. John Barrymore told me I was the only person who could have followed up on all that.

The musical debuted on Broadway in January 1941 and was a smash hit, making a star of Danny Kaye and Macdonald Carey and causing fresh appreciation for Mature&#x27;s talents. His performance was well received, Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling him &quot;unobjectionably handsome and affable&quot;. The description of Randy Curtis in the musical – &quot;Beautiful Hunk of Man&quot; – would be frequently used to describe Mature throughout his career. Mature missed some of the run due to an emergency appendectomy, but played the role until June.

===20th Century Fox===
When Mature left &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;, he announced that half of his contract with Hal Roach had been bought out by 20th Century Fox. His first film under the contract was to be &quot;Bowery Nightingale&quot; with Alice Faye. He was going to follow that with &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; for Arnold Pressburger and Josef von Sternberg at United Artists.

&quot;Bowery Nightingale&quot; was not made, so Fox instead assigned Mature to appear in a thriller with Faye, &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot; (which had a working title of &quot;Hot Spot&quot;); Faye ended up being replaced with Betty Grable. Filming of &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; was postponed to enable Mature to finish &quot;Screaming&quot;, which was a popular success. &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; also proved popular.

Mature was announced for a Fox musical, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, which ended up being postponed; instead, he replaced John Payne in a Betty Grable musical, &quot;Song of the Islands&quot; (Mature was replaced in turn on &quot;Highway&quot; by Cesar Romero).

Mature was paid $450 a week under his contract with Roach for &quot;Shanghai Gesture&quot;, but Roach received $3750 a week for Mature&#x27;s services. Roach received $22,000 for Mature in &quot;Song of the Islands&quot;, but Mature was paid $4,000. He asked for a pay increase of $1,250 a week.

RKO wanted Mature for &quot;Passage to Bordeaux&quot; and Josef von Sternberg wanted him for &quot;Lady Paname&quot;. Instead, Mature made another musical for Fox, supporting Rita Hayworth in &quot;My Gal Sal&quot; (a role originally meant for Don Ameche).

In November 1941, Fox bought out the four years remaining on Mature&#x27;s contract with Hal Roach for $80,000. (This included loan out provisions to RKO.) Roach had not wanted to sell, but he was in financial difficulties and his backers insisted. Mature would be paid $1,500 a week. He had also had six commitments with RKO. &quot;The studio [Fox] will have to make a success of me,&quot; Mature said. 

&quot;I wasn&#x27;t pampered the way a Tyrone Power was,&quot; Mature recalled later of his time at Fox. &quot;Zanuck would say, &#x27;If you&#x27;re not careful, I&#x27;ll give you Mature for your next picture&#x27;.&quot;

Fox talked of reuniting Hayworth and Mature in a Russian set war film &quot;Ski Patrol&quot;. Instead, Mature was lent to RKO for a musical with Lucille Ball, &quot;Seven Days&#x27; Leave&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Footlight Serenade&quot; with Grable and Payne. All these films were very popular at the box office.

===World War II===

In July 1942, Mature attempted to enlist in the U.S. Navy but was rejected for color blindness. He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard after taking a different eye test the same day. He was assigned to , which was part of the Greenland Patrol. This meant that when Paramount filmed &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;, Mature was unable to reprise his stage role. After 14 months aboard &quot;Storis&quot;, Mature was promoted to the rating of chief boatswain&#x27;s mate.

In 1944, he did a series of war bond tours and acted in morale-boosting shows. He assisted Coast-Guard recruiting efforts by being a featured player in the musical revue &quot;Tars and Spars&quot;, which opened in Miami, Florida, in April 1944 and toured the United States for the next year. In May 1945, Mature was reassigned to the Coast-Guard-manned troop transport , which was involved in transferring troops to the Pacific Theater. Mature was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard in November 1945 and he resumed his acting career.

===Resumption of career===

In December 1945, Mature signed a new two-year contract with Fox. Fox assigned him to &quot;Three Little Girls in Blue&quot;, but he was removed in order to play Philip Marlowe in an adaptation of &quot;The High Window&quot;. However, Mature withdrew from the project and was cast by John Ford in 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;, playing Doc Holliday opposite Henry Fonda&#x27;s Wyatt Earp. Fox production head Darryl Zanuck considered it to be one of Mature&#x27;s finest performances. Speaking of Mature to Ford, Zanuck said:

Zanuck promised Mature that he would not assign him to musicals. Mature was cast in the period thriller &quot;Moss Rose&quot; and received a $50,000 bonus after shooting ended. His next film was the film noir &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;, which had been developed specifically as a vehicle for him.

While still at Fox, Mature replaced John Payne in the Western film &quot;Fury at Furnace Creek,&quot; costarring with Coleen Gray, who had also starred in &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; with Mature. Fox announced plans to team them for a third time in a remake of &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, but the film did not materialize. Instead, he costarred with Richard Conte in &quot;Cry of the City,&quot; a thriller directed by Robert Siodmak. Mature&#x27;s performance as a world-weary cop was widely praised; one reviewer noted that he &quot;turns in an excellent performance, arguably the best of his career.&quot;

Mature still had a pre-war obligation to make a film at RKO. He was announced for &quot;Battleground&quot; before being cast in &quot;Interference,&quot; a serious drama about football that would become &quot;Easy Living&quot; in 1949, starring Lucille Ball.

===&quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;===

Mature&#x27;s career received a massive lift when he was borrowed by Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount to play the lead in the $3.5 million biblical spectacular &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. De Mille described the role of Samson as “a combination Tarzan, Robin Hood, and Superman.” Mature was reluctant to take the role at first out of fear of risking his new postwar reputation as a serious actor, but he changed his mind.

During filming, Mature was frightened by a number of the animals and mechanical props used in the production, including the lions, the wind machine, the swords and even the water. This infuriated the director, DeMille, who bellowed through his megaphone at the assembled cast and crew: “I have met a few men in my time. Some have been afraid of heights, some have been afraid of water, some have been afraid of fire, some have been afraid of closed spaces. Some have even been afraid of open spaces – or themselves. But in all my 35 years of picture-making experience, Mr. Mature, I have not until now met a man who was 100 percent yellow.”

While &quot;Samson&quot; was in postproduction, Paramount used Mature in another film, co-starring with Betty Hutton in &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot;, his first musical in a number of years. It was not particularly popular, and &quot;Easy Living&quot; was a flop, but &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; earned over $12 million during its original run, making it the most popular movie of the 1940s, and responsible for ushering in a cycle of spectacles set in the ancient world.

Mature returned to Fox and was put in a popular musical with Betty Grable, &quot;Wabash Avenue&quot;. It was directed by Henry Koster who recalled Mature was &quot;nice to work with, amusing. He very much looked out for his money always.&quot;

===RKO===

In late 1949, Mature was meant to fulfill another commitment at RKO, &quot;Alias Mike Fury&quot; (the new title for &quot;Mr Whiskers&quot;). Mature refused to make the movie and was put on suspension by Fox. The script was rewritten and Mature ended up making the film, which was retitled &quot;Gambling House&quot;.

Back at Fox, he supported Ann Sheridan in a comedy, &quot;Stella&quot;. In 1949, he was directed by Jacques Tourneur in &quot;Easy Living&quot;.

In September 1950, he was making a film in Montana about fire fighters, &quot;Wild Winds&quot;, for Fox with John Lund. Mature injured himself in a motorcycle accident . After Lund was stung by a wasp and the location was snowed in, it was decided to abandon the film. (It was later filmed with new stars as &quot;Red Skies of Montana&quot;.)

Mature took a number of months off, before returning to filmmaking with &quot;The Las Vegas Story&quot;, with Jane Russell at RKO. RKO released – but did not produce – Mature&#x27;s next film, &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;, an adaptation of the play by George Bernard Shaw with Mature as a Roman centurion. Like &quot;Las Vegas Story&quot;, it was a box-office failure.

Far more popular was a musical he made at MGM, &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; with Esther Williams, a biopic of Annette Kellermann, playing Kellermann&#x27;s promoter husband. According to Williams&#x27;s autobiography, she and Mature had a romantic relationship.

Back at Fox, Mature was meant to be reteamed with Betty Grable in a musical, &quot;The Farmer Takes a Wife&quot;, but the studio instead reassigned him to a comedy with Patricia Neal, &quot;Something for the Birds&quot;.

Back at RKO, Mature was meant to star in &quot;Split Second&quot;, but instead was reteamed with Jean Simmons in the romantic drama &quot;Affair with a Stranger&quot;. RKO still wanted him for &quot;Split Second&quot;, but instead Fox put him in a Korean War film, &quot;The Glory Brigade&quot;.

He followed this with a movie at Universal, &quot;The Veils of Bagdad&quot;. The release of this was held up until after that of Mature&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Robe&quot;.

===&quot;The Robe&quot;===

&quot;The Robe&quot; had been in development in Hollywood for over a decade. In December 1952, Mature signed to play Demetrius in two movies, &quot;The Robe&quot; and a sequel, &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot;. The films were shot consecutively.

&quot;The Robe&quot;, the first CinemaScope movie to be released (ahead of &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, which was actually the first film shot in the new process), was an enormous success, one of the most popular movies of all time. &quot;Veils of Bagdad&quot; was not as popular, but &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; was another hit.

Back at RKO, Mature made &quot;Dangerous Mission&quot; for producer Irwin Allen. He travelled to Holland in September 1953 to support Clark Gable and Lana Turner in a World War Two film made at MGM, &quot;Betrayed&quot;, another popular success.

Fox put Mature into another ancient history spectacle, &quot;The Egyptian&quot;. He was originally meant to co-star with Marlon Brando and Kirk Douglas. Mature renewed his contract with Fox for another year, his 12th at that studio. &quot;The Egyptian&quot; ended up starring Mature with Edmund Purdom and Michael Wilding, plus Bella Darvi; it was a box-office disappointment.

Mature went over to Universal to play the title role in &quot;Chief Crazy Horse&quot;, in exchange for a fee and a percentage of the profits.

===End of contract with Fox===
Fox wanted Mature to support Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward in &quot;Untamed&quot; (1955), but Mature refused, claiming he had worked for two years and wanted a vacation. The studio replaced him with Richard Egan and put him under what they called a &quot;friendly&quot; suspension.

In 1954, Mature signed a two-picture deal with Columbia Pictures, giving him script and co-star approval, at $200,000 a film. The first movie he made under this contract was &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (1955). Before he started making that, however, he was called back to Fox to appear in the heist thriller, &quot;Violent Saturday&quot;. This was the last movie he made at Fox.

===United Artists and Warwick Productions===
In March 1955, while making &quot;Last Frontier&quot;, Mature announced he had also signed a contract with United Artists for them to finance and distribute six films over five years for Mature&#x27;s own company.

In May 1955, Mature signed a two-picture contract with Warwick Productions. Warwick was an English company that had success making films aimed at the international market with American stars; they released their films in the USA through Columbia Pictures. The first of Mature&#x27;s films for Warwick was to be &quot;Zarak&quot;. He ended up making &quot;Safari&quot; beforehand, a tale of the Mau Mau, filming on location in Kenya. Both &quot;Safari&quot; and &quot;Zarak&quot; were successful.

Sam Goldwyn Jr, hired him to make &quot;The Sharkfighters&quot;, released through United Artists and shot on location in Cuba. He was back with Warwick for &quot;Interpol&quot;, reteaming him with his &quot;Zarak&quot; co-star, Anita Ekberg, filmed in locations throughout Europe. In London, he made &quot;The Long Haul&quot;, a truck-driving drama with Diana Dors, the second film under his deal with Columbia.

Mature finally made a movie for his own production company, Romina Productions, in conjunction with United Artists and Batjac Productions: &quot;China Doll&quot;, directed by Frank Borzage, with Mature as co-producer. Mature and Borzage announced they would also make &quot;The Incorrigibles&quot; and &quot;Vaults of Heaven&quot;.

Mature signed to make two more films with Warwick Productions, &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (Tank Force) and &quot;The Man Inside&quot;. He ended up only making the first, a World War II film with Libyan locations; Jack Palance took his role in &quot;The Man Inside&quot;.

Mature made another movie for Romina and Batjac, a Western, &quot;Escort West&quot;. It was released by United Artists, which also distributed &quot;Timbuktu&quot;, a French Foreign Legion adventure tale that Mature made for producer Edward Small and director Jacques Tourneur.

Mature was reunited with producer Irwin Allen for &quot;The Big Circus&quot;, shot in early 1959. He then made his second film for Warwick under his two-picture contract with them, &quot;The Bandit of Zhobe&quot;, following this with an Italian peplum, aka &quot;sword-and-sandal&quot; movie, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, with Mature in the title role. It was shot in Italy, as was &quot;The Tartars&quot; with Orson Welles. Mature then retired from acting.

In a 1978 interview, Mature said of his decision to retire from acting at age 46: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t fun anymore. I was OK financially so I thought what the hell – I&#x27;ll become a professional loafer.&quot;

==Retirement==
After five years of retirement, he was lured back into acting by the opportunity to parody himself in &quot;After the Fox&quot; (1966), co-written by Neil Simon. Mature played &quot;Tony Powell,&quot; an aging American actor who is living off his reputation from his earlier body of work. In a similar vein in 1968, he played a giant, The Big Victor, in &quot;Head&quot;, a movie starring The Monkees. 

Mature was famously self-deprecatory about his acting skills. Once, after being rejected for membership in a country club because he was an actor, he cracked, &quot;I&#x27;m not an actor — and I&#x27;ve got 64 films to prove it!&quot; He was quoted in 1968 on his acting career: &quot;Actually, I am a golfer. That is my real occupation. I never was an actor. Ask anybody, particularly the critics.&quot;

He came out of retirement again in 1971 to star in &quot;Every Little Crook and Nanny&quot; and again in 1976 along with many other former Hollywood stars in &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot;. His last feature film appearance was a cameo as a millionaire in &quot;Firepower&quot; in 1979, while his final acting role was that of Samson&#x27;s father Manoah in the TV movie &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; in 1984. In a 1971 interview, Mature quipped about his decision to retire:

I was never that crazy about acting. I had a compulsion to earn money, not to act. So, I worked as an actor until I could afford to retire. I wanted to quit while I could still enjoy life ... I like to loaf. Everyone told me I would go crazy or die if I quit working. Yeah? Well, what a lovely way to die.

In 1980, he said he was &quot;pretty proud of about 50% of my motion pictures. &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; wasn&#x27;t bad. &quot;The Robe&quot; and &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; weren&#x27;t bad. I made 72 of them and I made close to $18 million. So what the hell.&quot; He said in the same interview his favorite actors were Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, and especially Burt Reynolds.

==Personal life==
Mature was married five times.
* Frances Charles (1938–1940, annulled)
* Martha Stephenson Kemp, the widow of bandleader Hal Kemp, (1941–1943, divorced)
* Dorothy Stanford Berry (1948–1955, divorced) 
* Adrienne Joy Urwick (1959–1969, divorced)
* Loretta Gaye Sebena, an opera singer (1974 until his death) – with whom he had his only child, daughter Victoria (born 1975). Victoria became an opera singer like her mother.
He was also engaged to Rita Hayworth, before she married Orson Welles, and to Anne Shirley.

==Death==
Mature died of leukemia in 1999 at his Rancho Santa Fe, California home at the age of 86. He was buried in the family plot, marked by a replica of the Angel of Grief, at St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery in his hometown of Louisville.

For his contribution to the motion-picture industry, Mature has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6780 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Critical appraisal==
David Thomson wrote a critical appraisal of Mature in his book &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;:

Mature is an uninhibited creature of the naive. Simple, crude, and heady – like ketchup or treacle – he is a diet scorned by the knowing, but obsessive if succumbed to in error. It is too easy to dismiss Mature, for he surpasses badness. He is a strong man in a land of hundred pound weaklings, an incredible concoction of beef steak, husky voice, and brilliantine – a barely concealed sexual advertisement for soiled goods. Remarkably, he is as much himself in the cheerfully meretricious and the pretentiously serious. Such a career has no more pattern than a large ham; it slices consistently forever. The more lurid or distasteful the art the better Mature comes across.

==References in popular culture==
In 1985, at the Uptown Lounge in Athens, Georgia, R.E.M. performed under the pseudonym Hornets Attack Victor Mature. &quot;We sent a press release that said it was a combination of Jerry Lee Lewis and Joy Division,&quot; explained Peter Buck. &quot;God knows how we got a date, but we did.&quot; The name was used after Buck spotted it in a &#x27;Name Your Band&#x27; article in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;. It told of a Los Angeles band who had taken their name from a newspaper headline describing an incident where furious wasps had ganged up on the actor during a round of golf. The band had since opted for something a little more West Coast, so Buck considered Hornets Attack Victor Mature to be fair game. &quot;I figured anyone who&#x27;d pay money to see a band with a name that silly is our kind of person.&quot;

<doc id="442588" wikidata="Q1196737" url="?curid=442588" title="Mario Party">
<text>is a series of party video games created by Hudson Soft and owned by Nintendo. It features characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise in which up to four local players or computer-controlled characters (called &quot;CPUs&quot;) compete in a board game interspersed with minigames. Designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, and directed by Kenji Kikuchi, the games are currently developed by Nintendo Cube and published by Nintendo, being previously developed by Hudson Soft. The series is known for its party game elements, including the often unpredictable multiplayer game modes that allow play with up to four, and sometimes eight, human players or CPUs.

After the development of &quot;Mario Party 8&quot;, several of Hudson Soft&#x27;s key designers left to work for Nintendo subsidiary NDcube, developers of &quot;Wii Party&quot;. Starting in 2012 with &quot;Mario Party 9&quot;, NDcube has taken over development of the series from Hudson Soft. The first instalment in the series on the Nintendo Switch, &quot;Super Mario Party&quot;, was released on October 5, 2018.

The series received generally favourable reception in the beginning, but as the series has progressed, the reception became more mixed until the Switch era, where it improved. The series holds the record for the longest-running minigame series. As of December 2024, Nintendo reported cumulative worldwide sales of over 82 million copies in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; franchise.

== Gameplay ==
Over the course of the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series, gameplay has changed to suit the technology of the hardware. There are several game modes available in each of the games, each of which provides its own rules and challenges.

=== Party Mode ===
Every game in the main series has a standard Party Mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many stars as possible. In every turn, each player rolls a die (Dice Block) and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for 20 coins (traditionally). The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space. On some boards, the star location is fixed.

Every &quot;Mario Party&quot; game contains at least 50 to 112 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-vs-2 and 1-vs-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in &quot;Mario Party&quot; are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn&#x27;t say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.

Battle minigames first appeared in &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;. These games are like the four-player games, but instead of winners earning ten coins each, each player contributes a randomly selected number of coins (or all coins if the player falls short of the pot amount). The winner of the minigame receives approximately 70% of the pot, the second-place winner receives the other 30%, and a random player occasionally gets coins left over from rounding.

Duel minigames debuted in &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;, and were omitted in &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; (although the story minigames are all duels) but return again in &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;. Duel games pit two players against each other. In Party Mode, one player initiates the duel, wagering coins or even a star against another player. The winner of the duel receives all coins or stars wagered. Starting with &quot;Mario Party 7&quot;, the player no longer chooses the wager in a duel, rather, the duel takes place and the prize to the winner, if any, is randomly determined.

Bowser minigames are introduced in &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; in which players try to avoid being burned by Bowser&#x27;s fire breath if they lose. When this happens, players must give up coins, stars, or items. In &quot;Mario Party 7&quot;, a single-player version of the games was introduced and only one person can play.

&quot;Mario Party 9&quot; introduced a new set of Bowser Jr.-related minigames. In these minigames, Bowser Jr. challenges two players to compete in a minigame to battle him. If they successfully defeat him, both players will receive five Mini Stars. If not, then Bowser Jr. will take five from each player.

&quot;Mario Party 9&quot; also introduced a car mechanic. In &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; and &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, every player navigates the board in a car rather than move independently of one another. &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; has a lesser focus on strategy, and its minigames do not impact the board game in ways that the previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games did. Critics heavily censured the car mechanic; &quot;Destructoid&quot; noted, &quot;An over-reliance on random chance over strategy can quickly derail the experience when things go awry at the worst possible time ...&quot; The car mechanic was kept in &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, although &quot;Super Mario Party&quot; finally lets players move individually on the board again.

&quot;Super Mario Party Jamboree&quot; introduced a new feature called “Jamboree Buddy”, where players can earn that character from winning a Showdown Minigame. Each character has a different ability like buying Stars and items at half price. In addition, players can earn double the benefits or penalties with the Jamboree Buddy. &quot;Super Mario Party Jamboree&quot; features the most minigames in &quot;Mario Party&quot; history with 112.

In most &quot;Mario Party&quot; games, at the end of a board game, bonus stars can be awarded to players. Three specific stars are awarded in the first six games. All later games have six possible bonus stars, but up to three of those stars are awarded per game. These stars add to the player&#x27;s overall total. If there’s a tie in coins and stars, then a Dice Block tiebreaker will determine the game&#x27;s final ranking.

=== Minigame modes ===
In addition to Party Mode, every &quot;Mario Party&quot; has a minigame mode in which minigames are played without the board game. Minigame modes vary from game to game, but later games have many different variations. In one such example from &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;, each player tries to fill a board with as many spaces as possible in their colour by winning minigames in Mini-Game Wars. In &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; and onward, there is one game in Minigame mode intended for single player.

== Playable characters ==
=== Available in all games ===
The following characters appear in all twelve console &quot;Mario Party&quot; games and, except where noted, all five handheld instalments:
* Mario
* Luigi
* Princess Peach
* Yoshi
* Wario (except &quot;Advance&quot;)
The first four games also add Donkey Kong to this roster. In &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;, he is relegated to the Super Duel Mode, and he was omitted from subsequent games as a playable character until &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;.

==== &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; onwards ====
* Princess Daisy (except &quot;Advance&quot;)
* Waluigi (except &quot;Advance&quot;)

==== &quot;Mario Party 10&quot; onwards ====
* Rosalina

=== Home console games ===
These characters were included or excluded in home console releases, starting with &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;.

=== Handheld console games ===
These characters were included or excluded in portable console releases, starting with &quot;Mario Party DS&quot;.

== Games ==
=== Main series ===
==== &quot;Mario Party&quot; (1998) ====


Mario Party is the first in the series. It was released in 1998 and 1999 for the Nintendo 64. Its roster of playable characters includes Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong (referred to as DK in-game), Yoshi, and Wario. It features 50 minigames, ten of which are single-player-only. &quot;Mario Party&quot;″s standard game mode, Party Mode, lets up to four players play on a board interspersed with minigames. The game features eight different boards with varying difficulties. It is hosted by Toad, who guides the characters on their journeys throughout each board.

In addition to the standard Party Mode, the game also features a single-player mode called Mini-Game Island, where the player&#x27;s goal is to navigate an island and beat all 50 minigames as supplied. The player starts with four lives and loses a life every time they fail at a minigame. Winning a minigame gives the player coins, and collecting 100 coins grants the player one additional life. &quot;Mario Party&quot; also features Rumble Pak support, which lets players know when their turn has started.

Upon completing Mini-Game Island, a Bumper Ball Maze is awarded, a single-player minigame playable in the Mini-Game House. The player can unlock two additional Bumper Ball Mazes by completing all 50 minigames in Mini-Game Island and, respectively, setting new time records in the first two Bumper Ball Mazes.

&quot;Mario Party&quot; received praise for its unique party and social elements; however, &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the slow pacing of the game and the lack of enjoyment when played alone. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said, &quot;The games that are enjoyable to play in multi-player are nowhere near as good in the single player mode. Really, it&#x27;s that multi-player competitive spark of screaming at and/or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often-simple little games, and without it, they&#x27;re just simple little games.&quot;

==== &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; (1999) ====

Mario Party 2 is the sequel to &quot;Mario Party&quot; and was released in 1999 and 2000 for the Nintendo 64. While &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; is similar to the original game, it introduced a variety of new gameplay elements, such as collectible items that players can buy from item shops and three new minigame types: &quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;, and &quot;Duel&quot;. Toad returns as the host in &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;. The game also has 15 more minigames than the original game, with a total of 65 minigames (or 88 if one counts the different courses in some of the minigames).

&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; features the same characters as the original game with no additions; however, each character dresses according to the theme of the board. &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; is the only &quot;Mario Party&quot; game where this occurs. &quot;Mario Party 2&quot; does not reuse any of the original game&#x27;s boards but does have references to them and reuses some of their gimmicks in the new boards.

&quot;Mario Party 2&quot; features a mode called Mini-Game Land, where players can buy minigames that the player can play freely from a tree character called Woody.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; praised &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;″s minigames, noting that they were a lot more fun than those of the first game. &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the game is &quot;more of the same&quot; and said that the game might not be worth its price unless the buyer considers themselves a &quot;Mario Party fanatic&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; rated the game a 7.9 out of 10, further noting that the sequel was better than the original but that it did not &quot;offer enough new to warrant a higher score&quot;. It recommended the game only to those who did not own the original.

==== &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; (2000) ====

Mario Party 3 was released in 2000 and 2001 for the Nintendo 64. It features the same cast of playable characters as the previous two games with the addition of Princess Daisy and Waluigi. The most notable difference in this game compared to the previous two games in the series is that each player can hold up to three items instead of only one. It also has 71 minigames, compared to &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;″s 65.

&quot;Mario Party 3&quot;″s story revolves around a new character called the Millennium Star, who replaces Toad as the host. Like &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;, the game features all new boards, with some boards referencing the boards of the previous game and reusing their gimmicks. &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; is also the first game in the series to feature a single-player story campaign.

The game&#x27;s story mode features &quot;battle royal&quot; boards and &quot;duel&quot; boards, where players fight one another for items called &quot;Star Stamps&quot;.

Like &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; criticized &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; for not having enough new content. It also criticized the game&#x27;s new story mode, noting that the player was forced to watch computer-controlled opponents for too long and too often, even while they were playing minigames on their own. It also noted that moving around the board in this mode quickly became tedious and boring. The review author further asserted, &quot;I think it&#x27;d be better be classified as a tutorial mode.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted, &quot;While pure innovation may not be king in the Mario Party world, Hudson&#x27;s dedication to solid, addictive puzzle gaming that makes for a wholly enjoyable multiplayer experience is apparent.&quot;

&quot;HonestGamers&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s boards, noting, &quot;They&#x27;re just not much fun.&quot; It further explained, &quot;Some of them are, to be fair.&quot; It also criticized the game&#x27;s options and menus, stating that it is difficult to even begin a new game. Additionally, it censured the game&#x27;s &quot;down-to-the-wire games&quot;, stating, &quot;it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep stars you win unless you&#x27;re guarding them very carefully.&quot; It further explained that mostly, a player&#x27;s threat is not their human opponents but rather the computer-controlled players, describing how computer-controlled opponents will quickly steal the player&#x27;s stars after they get them.

==== &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; (2002) ====

Mario Party 4 is the first game in the series to appear on a console other than the Nintendo 64. &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; was released for the GameCube in 2002. &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; features the same roster of playable characters as &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; and does not feature any new playable characters. It does, however, feature a new team battle system that allows players to team up in pairs in Party Mode, the standard game mode of the series. This game was the last game to feature Donkey Kong as a playable character up until &quot;Mario Party 10&quot; for the Wii U. Instead of the Millennium Star, &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; features multiple hosts, including Toad and a Koopa Troopa. The game also featured 60 new minigames.

&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; is the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game to include side-collectibles, which are in the form of presents. It also introduces the ability for players to create their own custom minigame packs. Elements introduced in the previous game also return, such as the ability for players to team up in Party Mode and the ability to hold up to three items at a time.

&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; is also the first game in the series to feature boards fully rendered in 3D, although the navigational board space layout remained 2D until &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;.

As usual, &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the minigames of &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;. It called the game &quot;arguably the most accomplished entry in the series yet&quot;, while further noting, &quot;While more accomplished gamers may find some of the minigames too simplistic, this accessibility ensures that Mario&#x27;s party is one that just about anyone can enjoy.&quot; It also mentioned the improved graphics of the game while further noting that the character models of the game were more simplified compared to their counterparts in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, released about a year before &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; also noted the game&#x27;s improved visuals while explaining that they were not representative of what the GameCube can achieve and criticized the game&#x27;s textures, noting that they were not greatly detailed. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; did, however, praise its &quot;happy&quot; music but criticized the minigames, saying, &quot;none really stand out&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;, however, praised the improved visuals of the game and noted, &quot;&quot;Mario Party 4&quot; is exactly how you would envision it on GameCube: all-new mini-games and better visuals&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also called the game &quot;an absolute must-rent if you have a few friends over for the weekend&quot; and &quot;definitely an &#x27;everybody&#x27; title&quot;.

==== &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; (2003) ====

Mario Party 5 was released in 2003 for the GameCube. It features the same playable character roster as the previous two instalments with the exclusion of Donkey Kong and addition of Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Rather than &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;″s large number of hosts, &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; features the Star Spirits, known as the Star Guards in this game, who first appeared in the 2000 &quot;Paper Mario&quot; for the Nintendo 64. The game also features 78 new minigames.

One of the most major changes that &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; made to the series was replacing collectible items with &quot;capsules&quot; (called &quot;orbs&quot; in later games), which players receive from a capsule machine, a talking robot vending machine that gives the player passing it a random capsule at no charge of coins, on the board. In addition to giving the player who uses it an advantage over the other players, capsules can also allow the player to set up traps for other players by throwing them at a space in front of them. These traps include forcing the player who lands on the capsule space to only be able to roll numbers from one to five on the Dice Block or forcing them to move ten spaces forward on the board.

&quot;Mario Party 5&quot; also introduces a new mode, Super Duel Mode. This mode is a one-versus-one battle mode where two players face off against each other using custom-assembled vehicles (called &quot;machines&quot; in-game). In this mode, players buy machine parts using points—awarded by playing minigames in either Party Mode or Minigame Mode—and build battle machines to use in different tournaments. There are a total of 44 different parts that can be used to customize a vehicle. To unlock all the parts, the player must play all the tournaments and beat certain opponents.

&quot;IGN&quot; praised the multiplayer elements of the game, as usual, but criticized its &quot;spotty&quot; single-player mode. It called it &quot;the perfect drinking game for college dorms ... and at the same time a great game for kids to enjoy with their siblings.&quot; It called &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; &quot;likely as good as mini-game party games get.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized how the game&#x27;s graphics had not been improved from the previous game in the series and said, &quot;the boards are looking a little bland, with some inconsistent texture quality&quot;. It further noted, &quot;The minigames, while not terribly visually enticing, tend to do their jobs well enough, without slowdown or glaring visual faults.&quot; It also criticized the voice work for, &quot;while generally fitting the cheery tone of the game&quot;, being &quot;largely recycled from &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;.&quot; It also criticized its music that it noted was &quot;almost painfully cheery tunes that are basically riffs from a few classic [&quot;Super&quot;] &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; themes.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that it was &quot;hard to recommend&quot; the game to owners of the previous game in the series but recommended it to casual fans who had not already played a &quot;Mario Party&quot; game.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot; called the game a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, criticizing its music, slow pace, and lack of originality. It noted that the game &quot;can be a laugh&quot; if &quot;played with the right group&quot; but also noted, &quot;there are far better things to do with your time, your GameCube, and such marvelously entertaining friends&quot;, saying, &quot;Western gamers are quite right to ignore this.&quot; &quot;Gaming Trend&quot; praised the replay value of the game but criticized the repetitive nature of the game.

==== &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; (2004) ====

Mario Party 6 was released in 2004 and 2005 for the GameCube. It is the first game in the series to make use of the GameCube&#x27;s microphone peripheral that was packaged with the game. It features the same cast of playable characters as the previous game with the addition of Toadette, although she has to be unlocked by buying her for thirty stars in the Star Bank, a place in the game where one player can trade stars for prizes and other valuables, including new difficulty levels and rare minigames. &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; features two new characters as its hosts: Brighton and Twila, who depict the sun and the moon, respectively. It also featured 82 new minigames. This marked the last appearance of the &quot;autoplay&quot; function where the game plays itself in Party Mode.

&quot;Mario Party 6&quot; is famous for its introduction of a day–night cycle system implemented for boards and minigames. This is a concept that had previously only been seen in Horror Land, a board in &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;. &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; is the first and only game in the series to feature a day–night cycle system for all boards and minigames.

&quot;IGN&quot; noted that the graphics, sound, and minigames of the game are &quot;just good enough&quot;, further explaining, &quot;But when put together, &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; still manages to generate that glee of unexpectedly trouncing your opponent because you&#x27;re the only one who knew that you used more capsules and thus deserve another star.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted, &quot;The fundamental formula isn&#x27;t so different, but it&#x27;s different enough that even if you&#x27;ve played all five previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games, there&#x27;s still something new for you.&quot; It further criticized the game&#x27;s graphics, comparing it to &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;, which was released a month before &quot;Mario Party 6&quot;. It further criticized the board designs, noting, &quot;While the board designs are new, they&#x27;re no more inventive in design than what we&#x27;ve seen before, and they certainly don&#x27;t look any better.&quot; It further criticized the game and its developer, noting, &quot;... we can&#x27;t shake the feeling that Hudson will continue riding the same graphical technology for as long as it can still sell copies.&quot;

==== &quot;Mario Party 7&quot; (2005) ====

Mario Party 7 was released in 2005 and 2006 for the GameCube. It was the series&#x27; last instalment on the GameCube. The microphone integration returns from the previous game, and the game introduces a new mode that allows up to eight players to play together. It features the same roster of playable characters with the exclusion of Koopa Kid and the addition of Birdo and Dry Bones as unlockable characters. Toadette is now unlocked from the start. Rather than &quot;Mario Party 6&quot;″s Brighton and Twila, Toadsworth, who first appeared in the 2002 GameCube game &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, is the host of &quot;Mario Party 7&quot;. The game also features 88 new minigames.

Former &quot;IGN&quot; author Matt Casamassina wrote in a review for &quot;Mario Party 7&quot;, &quot;&quot;Mario Party 7&quot; is still entertaining, but I&#x27;d be a liar if I wrote that I&#x27;m not growing bored with new iterations of the same old formula.&quot; He further noted, &quot;To its credit, the title delivers some fun new boards and mini-games, and the multiplayer experience is as robust and enjoyable as ever.&quot; He then went on to criticize the game&#x27;s single-player mode: &quot;But it in contrast dishes out a worthless single-player mode marred by tediously slow computer-controlled character interactions. And the overall presentation of the story, cut-scenes and real-time achievements is only passable.&quot; He called the game &quot;a decent sequel to an aging franchise&quot;, noting, &quot;the only people that should truly be interested in it are those dedicated to multiplayer parties. Everybody else can either make due with last year&#x27;s version or avoid the series altogether.&quot;

Former &quot;GameSpot&quot; writer Ryan Davis criticized the game&#x27;s lack of originality, as he usually does when reviewing &quot;Mario Party&quot; games, but he commended the game&#x27;s new eight-player multiplayer mode, noting, &quot;The addition of eight-player minigames is really the only new feature worth considering buying the game for, as the rest of the changes are token gestures. So it&#x27;s otherwise the same old &quot;Mario Party&quot; all over again.&quot; He further declared, &quot;this compulsive level of sameness is counterbalanced by the fact that (besides the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series) there are not a lot of other games like this on the GameCube these days—or anywhere else, for that matter.&quot;

In its review of the game, &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; praised its support for up to eight players and large number of minigames but censured its relatively small roster of playable characters (12), poor microphone implementation, and the long waiting times when playing with computer-controlled opponents.

==== &quot;Mario Party 8&quot; (2007) ====

Mario Party 8 was the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Wii, released in 2007 and 2008. It was also the last home-console game in the series to be developed by Hudson Soft, before NDcube took over the games&#x27; development starting from the next game in the series. The game features 73 new minigames, most of which utilize the motion control capabilities of the Wii Remote.

&quot;Mario Party 8&quot; features all the characters from the last game with the addition of Blooper and Hammer Bro. Players can also play as their Mii character in certain modes. The game features new items called &quot;candies&quot;, which replace &quot;capsules&quot;, or &quot;orbs&quot;, from the last three games in the series. These items are found throughout the boards and can be collected by players to aid themselves or hinder the progress of opponents. Positive effects range from getting to roll two dice blocks instead of one to getting to move to another player&#x27;s board space. Other candies may let players steal stars from opponents or change the position of other player characters on the board.

The game&#x27;s story revolves around a ringmaster, named MC Ballyhoo, and his talking hat, Big Top. After inviting Mario and his friends to a carnival, called the Star Carnival, Ballyhoo promises that whoever wins is crowned the Superstar and receives a year&#x27;s supply of candy. This begins the board games.

&quot;Mario Party 8&quot; takes use of the Wii Remote&#x27;s motion control features, allowing the player to wave it, point and shoot, and more during minigames. In addition to the standard Party Mode, the game also features a single-player mode called Star Battle Arena, where the player can compete with a computer-controlled character on boards and in minigames.

&quot;Mario Party 8&quot; sold nearly nine million copies, making it the eleventh best-selling Wii game. Despite the impressive sales numbers, &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s lack of originality. &quot;IGN&quot; lambasted the game, citing the game&#x27;s few changes from the last games in the series, slow pace, lacklustre single-player mode, and &quot;loose attention to detail&quot;. It finally noted, &quot;In spite of our issues with the game, people who loved Mario Party 7 will probably enjoy Mario Party 8, too, but we&#x27;ve chosen not to reward Nintendo with an undeserved high score for a copy/paste sequel.&quot;

Similarly, &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the game&#x27;s developer, Hudson Soft, had gotten &quot;a little too comfortable&quot; with &quot;Mario Party&quot; being &quot;the only persistent minigame [series] for years&quot;. It further noted, &quot;The fact that there are more interesting minigame collections out there now, like &quot;Rayman Raving Rabbids&quot;, puts that laziness in stark relief and makes it more difficult to tolerate. If you&#x27;ve got the patience to dig past the skill-free board game portions of &quot;Mario Party 8&quot;, there are some genuinely inventive minigames to be played. The point, though, is that you shouldn&#x27;t have to dig at all.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; also criticized the game&#x27;s &quot;lacklustre presentation&quot;, noting its &quot;garish color palette&quot; and &quot;stomping, blaring marching-band soundtrack&quot;. It explained that the visual fidelity of the game had not been improved in the move from the GameCube and further noted, &quot;in some ways, it actually looks worse now.&quot; It criticized the game&#x27;s aliasing and how the game would not fill a widescreen display during gameplay, instead using black borders, further describing, &quot;It&#x27;s awkward, and it&#x27;s borderline embarrassing that a Nintendo-published Wii game doesn&#x27;t have full widescreen support.&quot;

&quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted the game&#x27;s many &quot;obvious missed opportunities&quot;, criticizing the limitation of the Mii character and how it could only be played in a few game modes. Like &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; criticized the lack of widescreen support, lack of originality, and poor motion controls. Additionally, it criticized the game&#x27;s single-player mode, calling it &quot;so utterly wretched it scarcely warrants discussion&quot;, further noting, &quot;To add insult to injury, you have to go through it twice to unlock the mere two extra characters.&quot; Finally, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said, &quot;Fun could be had here, but even with the most forgiving group of friends, it&#x27;s going to be short-lived.&quot;

==== &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; (2012) ====

Mario Party 9 was released in 2012 and 2013 for the Wii. It was the first game in the series to be developed by NDcube instead of Hudson Soft, who developed all the previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games. The game&#x27;s playable character roster consists of the same characters as in the previous game with the exclusion of Toadette, Boo, Dry Bones, Blooper, and Hammer Bro; and the addition of Koopa Troopa, Shy Guy, and Magikoopa, named &quot;Kamek&quot; in the PAL version of the game. The game features 82 new minigames.

Replacing MC Ballyhoo and Big Top as the hosts of the game is Yellow Toad, who hosts the board games, and Blue Toad, who hosts the minigames. A green Toad also appears near the end of board games to initiate an event similar to the &quot;Last Five Turns Event&quot; from past &quot;Mario Party&quot; games.

&quot;Mario Party 9&quot; also introduces the Mini Stars and Mini Ztars. Mini Stars are small white stars that the characters need to obtain in order to advance on each board. Mini Ztars are the counterpart to Mini Stars, being small, dark, and purple stars that cause a player to lose as many Mini Stars as the amount of Mini Ztars they collected.

The most notable feature that &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; introduced to the series was the car mechanic. In &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; and &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, every player navigates the board in a car rather than move independently of one another. &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; has a lesser focus on strategy, and its minigames do not impact the board game in ways that the previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games did. Critics heavily censured the car mechanic; &quot;Destructoid&quot; noted, &quot;An over-reliance on random chance over strategy can quickly derail the experience when things go awry at the worst possible time ...&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, Shuichiro Nishiya, a game redirector from NDcube, said in relation to the car mechanic, &quot;In past instalments, everyone would move separately through the board. As a result, the actions of the other players often didn&#x27;t affect you. You could just look at the TV screen when it was your turn and during the minigames.&quot; He further noted, &quot;In &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, though, players move together in a car, so each player&#x27;s action will affect the others, meaning you&#x27;ll need to keep an eye on the TV screen.&quot;

In spite of the infamous car mechanic, &quot;IGN&quot; called &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; &quot;the best Mario Party since the series reached its heights in the early GameCube days&quot;, further noting, &quot;But throughout its many generations, Mario Party has carried a fatal flaw ...: In spite of your proficiency at mini-games, or penchant for board game strategy, [the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series] is dictated by the dice roll. Randomness, which &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; flaunts with a particularly annoying brand of euphoric abandon, ultimately ruins what could be a very good game.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; once again criticized the lack of originality. It also criticized one &quot;problematic&quot; minigame where the motion controls were &quot;fussy&quot; and &quot;needlessly [complicated]&quot;. It complimented the game&#x27;s minigames, noting that they make the game &quot;entertaining for a few hours, and there&#x27;s enough content to make it worth coming back for more&quot;; however, it noted that it is &quot;highly preferable to play with friends&quot; due to the game&#x27;s focus on luck rather than strategy. &quot;GameSpot&quot; also criticized the game&#x27;s single-player story campaign, describing it as &quot;[not] very engaging&quot;. It noted that each game lasts for too long and that it was unfortunate that the player is forced to beat the single-player mode to unlock the game&#x27;s sixth board and two of the twelve playable characters. It finally called the game &quot;a decent package with a lot of content, even if the Story mode is something you&#x27;ll wish you could avoid.&quot; It then went on to say, &quot;It&#x27;s colorful, good looking, and fun with others, but after so many games, the appeal just isn&#x27;t going to last for many people. There&#x27;s no denying that what &quot;Mario Party 9&quot; does, it largely does well; it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s largely been doing it well for nine console games and two handheld games. Once you&#x27;ve spent a few hours with mates, seen all the different boards, and played all the minigames, there&#x27;s very little incentive to return. Much like that high school reunion, it is fun for a night, but you won&#x27;t have any hesitation about moving on.&quot;

==== &quot;Mario Party 10&quot; (2015) ====

Mario Party 10 was released in 2015 for the Wii U. It was the only &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the system, and most of the playable characters from the previous game return, although Birdo, Koopa Troopa, Shy Guy, and Magikoopa are absent. The game does, however, introduce Rosalina, Spike, and Bowser (playable in the Bowser Party mode) as playable characters for the first time in the series and additionally re-introduces Donkey Kong, who had not been in a &quot;Mario Party&quot; game since &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;, and Toadette. The game also introduced two new modes: Bowser Mode and amiibo Party. It also re-introduces the car mechanic from the previous game, where players navigate the board together in a car rather than move individually as seen in older games in the series.

In &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;, the game&#x27;s standard board game mode is called &quot;Mario Party&quot;. In this mode, players compete to get the most Mini Stars, as in previous games. In the game&#x27;s new Bowser Party mode, one player controls Bowser using the primary controller for the Wii U, the Wii U GamePad, and up to four other players control Mario and his friends using Wii Remotes. In this mode, Mini Stars are replaced by hearts, which serve as the players&#x27; health points. The goal of the player playing as Bowser is to deplete the health of the players in Team Mario, while the goal of the other players is to reach the Super Star at the end of the board with at least one player with at least one heart remaining. If Bowser catches up to Team Mario, every player has to play a randomly-selected &quot;Bowser Battle&quot; minigame, where the hearts of players on Team Mario are lost if they are hit by Bowser&#x27;s attacks. If Team Mario&#x27;s players lose all their hearts, Bowser wins.

The game also introduces the amiibo Party mode. In this mode, up to four players can scan the amiibo for a character and play as that character on small boards. Players compete for the most stars, which can be bought with coins. Rather than traditional characters, the players control amiibo figures of the characters whose amiibo they scanned. If a player does not own an amiibo figure, they play as a cardboard cutout as a character instead.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;TrustedReviews&quot; criticized &quot;Mario Party 10&quot; for being too similar to the previous games in the series. &quot;GameSpot&quot; further criticized the game&#x27;s lack of strategy and cited that the game has &quot;an annoying habit of stealing stars away from whoever is in the lead&quot;, explaining that this makes the any effort the player has put into the minigames &quot;largely [moot].&quot; It was also censured for keeping the car mechanic from the previous game. &quot;Den of Geek!&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s new Bowser Party mode, calling it &quot;basically a sprint to the finish line, with no depth or complexity, and one that is typically over in a handful of uneventful turns.&quot; It praised the fun minigames of the standard mode, &quot;Mario Party&quot; but further criticized the game, saying &quot;it never matters whether you actually win or lose in any of the game modes&quot;, noting that most of what the game offers is already unlocked from the start. It noted that the game lacks inspiration and stated that despite the fun minigames, &quot;everything else feels incredibly deflated&quot; and &quot;Bowser Party comes across as gimmicky and mundane, other modes are restricted by amiibo and controller types, and a clear &#x27;everyone&#x27;s a winner&#x27; mentality strips away any sense of challenge that could have been had here.&quot;

&quot;IGN&quot; criticized the new amiibo Party mode, describing, &quot;The integration of amiibo amounts to little more than constantly tapping the figures to a sensor in the corner of the GamePad. You tap to roll, tap to stop random spinners, tap to use items... You tap the GamePad a lot.&quot; It also criticized the minigames&#x27; infrequency, noting that in the standard game mode, &quot;Mario Party&quot;, the players only get to play a minigame if one of them lands on a minigame board space, further noting that these spaces are rare on the boards. It did, however, praise the Bowser Party mode, calling it &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;″s &quot;greatest achievement and one of the best uses of the Wii U GamePad yet&quot;.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted the game&#x27;s &quot;prudent&quot; motion controls but called the Amiibo implementation &quot;decidedly mixed&quot;, noting that the boards are &quot;far less dynamic&quot;, further explaining, &quot;it&#x27;s the same board repurposed slightly depending on which compatible figures you own; they look different, but are otherwise functionally similar.&quot; However, like &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; praised the Bowser Party mode and called it the &quot;unlikely champion&quot; of the Wii U&#x27;s various uses of the GamePad in games. Finally, it said, &quot;This is, at least, in the upper echelons of the series: a little short of the Hudson Soft heyday, maybe, but better than every entry since the fifth, and certainly superior to the anemic eighth entry and the pointless handheld versions.&quot;

==== &quot;Super Mario Party&quot; (2018) ====

&quot;Super Mario Party&quot; was released in 2018 for the Nintendo Switch. The game features the second largest roster of playable characters in any &quot;Mario Party&quot; game, featuring nearly every character from &quot;Mario Party 10&quot; (minus Spike), with the addition of Dry Bones, Goomba, Boo, Koopa Troopa, Hammer Bro, Shy Guy, Bowser Jr., Diddy Kong, Pom Pom, and Monty Mole. Additionally, Bowser, who had only previously been playable in &quot;Mario Party 10&quot;″s Bowser Party and amiibo Party modes, is now playable in the standard Party Mode.

&quot;Super Mario Party&quot;″s most notable change is the removal of the car mechanic. In this game, players navigate the board individually like in past &quot;Mario Party&quot; instalments. The game also introduces a new mode called &quot;Toad&#x27;s Rec Room&quot;, where players can pair up two Nintendo Switch units to form a single connected board to play minigames on.

&quot;Super Mario Party&quot; also introduces online multiplayer for the first time in the series. While the standard board games are restricted to the game&#x27;s standard Party Mode, players are able to play the game&#x27;s 80 minigames with other players either locally or online, independent of the board games, in the game&#x27;s new &quot;Online Mario-thon&quot; mode. In this mode, players compete in five randomly-selected minigames, aiming to get the highest score. It also features leaderboards and a ranking system, as well as rewards that the players can receive for playing the mode.

Some sources criticized the game&#x27;s lack of an online board game mode, although others still praised the lack of the infamous car mechanic and the focus on traditional &quot;Mario Party&quot; gameplay. Nearly three years after release, a late patch has made the board game mode available for online play for the first time in the series.

====&quot;Super Mario Party Jamboree&quot; (2024)====

&quot;Super Mario Party Jamboree&quot; was revealed during the June 18, 2024 Nintendo Direct, and released on October 17, 2024. It contains seven boards (two of which are returning from previous games), Jamboree Buddies, the largest playable roster with Pauline and Ninji, 112 minigames, and an online 20-player mode.
=== Handheld console games ===
==== &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; (2005) ====

&quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005. It was the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for a handheld console and was the only &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Game Boy Advance. It features four playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Yoshi. The hosts of the game are Tumble, Toad, Professor Elvin Gadd, and Toadette. Its antagonists are Bowser and three of his children: Blue Koopa Kid, Green Koopa Kid, and Red Koopa Kid.

Its standard mode is &quot;Shroom City&quot;, in which the player takes control of one of the playable characters and travels around the city Shroom City, completing quests and collecting minigames and &quot;Gaddgets&quot; to play in other modes.

==== &quot;Mario Party DS&quot; (2007) ====

&quot;Mario Party DS&quot; was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS. It was the first and only &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Nintendo DS. It was also the last game in the series overall to be developed by Hudson Soft. It featured 73 minigames, many of which took use of the Nintendo DS&#x27;s touchscreen, microphone, and unique dual screen capabilities, in addition to traditional-style minigames using the D-pad and buttons. The game features Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, and Toad as playable characters.

&quot;IGN&quot; noted that it was &quot;honestly very difficult to get excited for yet another Mario Party, even though it&#x27;s the first time it&#x27;s been made for the Nintendo DS system.&quot; It noted that &quot;Mario Party DS&quot; is &quot;a solid multiplayer mini-game experience with a lot of the flaws of the previous versions.&quot; It further explained, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t do anything truly special than create a bunch of touch screen and microphone-centric minigames (and even then we&#x27;ve seen variations of them in other DS titles), but it at least comes together as a better title than the last console &quot;Mario Party&quot; design.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the large number of minigames and their quality, noting, &quot;Typically, a collection like this made for the Nintendo DS will give you 20 or 30 minigames. This one has more than 70. Remarkably, despite that lofty number, there aren&#x27;t many duds.&quot; It criticized the single-player mode but described the multiplayer aspect of the game as &quot;an outright blast&quot;.

==== &quot;Mario Party: Island Tour&quot; (2013) ====

&quot;Mario Party: Island Tour&quot; was the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Nintendo 3DS, released in 2013 and 2014. It features 81 minigames, many of which utilize the 3DS&#x27;s touch screen and dual screen capabilities, as well as the system&#x27;s other unique features. It features Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, Boo, Toad, and Bowser Jr. as playable characters. It was the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game to feature Bowser Jr. as a playable character.

&quot;IGN&quot; criticized &quot;Mario Party: Island Tour&quot; for its &quot;mostly bland&quot; minigames, additionally noting, &quot;a handful are just bad.&quot; &quot;If you’ve played a &quot;Mario Party&quot; game before, you’ll recognize that a majority of the games are based around returning ideas&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; said. It cited that some of the game&#x27;s minigames used the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s touchscreen &quot;effectively&quot; but rated the game 5.5 out of 10 for its &quot;mostly boring minigames unfortunate system-jerking motion control.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; said that many of the minigames do a good job of taking advantage of the 3DS&#x27;s unique features in their design but noted, &quot;there are still some stinkers in the mix.&quot; &quot;Strictly luck-based minigames turn up in the rotation frequently, and they&#x27;re not any fun,&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; said. It also cited the game&#x27;s &quot;sluggish controls that hamper your ability to move well.&quot; Finally, it said, &quot;It&#x27;s not a perfect party by any means, but some good design considerations, better-than-average variety, and always-enjoyable &quot;Mario&quot; thematics put &quot;Mario Party: Island Tour&quot; a few notches above your average video game bash-in-a-box.&quot; It rated the game 7 out of 10.

&quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said that winning minigames is &quot;inconsequential ... in the grand scheme of things&quot;. It called the game&#x27;s visuals &quot;satisfactory, getting the job done without doing anything to wow.&quot; It finally noted, &quot;The &quot;Mario Party&quot; series isn&#x27;t changing much, and when it does, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be for the better. The pieces of Island Tour that work the best are the ones sticking to the form established early in the series — fun, accessible mini-games that don&#x27;t over-complicate things. It&#x27;s the game boards that need better ideas, and the &quot;less is more&quot; approach would suit future instalments better. The focus on luck, swapping places at random, and — specific to this instalment — the short length all conspire to hamper what could easily have been a much more enjoyable experience. There&#x27;s still a ton of rowdy multiplayer fun to be had, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that a whole portion of the game is so hit-or-miss.&quot;

==== &quot;Mario Party: Star Rush&quot; (2016) ====

&quot;Mario Party: Star Rush&quot; was the second &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Nintendo 3DS. Released in 2016 and 2017, the game was the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; game on a handheld console to be compatible with amiibo figures. The game features Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, Toad, Toadette, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, and Diddy Kong as playable characters. Blue Toad, Yellow Toad, Red Toad, and Green Toad are also playable in the &quot;Toad Scramble&quot; mode, the standard game mode of &quot;Star Rush&quot;. The Additionally, Bowser, Bowser Jr., and Boo can be played as by tapping their amiibo figures in the &quot;Mario Shuffle&quot; mode. The only character that is not available in the &quot;Mario Shuffle&quot; mode is Toadette. &quot;Mario Party: Star Rush&quot; has a total of 53 minigames.

In the game&#x27;s main mode, Toad Scramble, up to four players start out with a Toad, where their colour corresponds to each player. The goal of the mode is to amass the most stars; players can retrieve stars by placing first in the boss minigames. Players can battle bosses by landing on the space in front of them on the board, and every time a boss minigame is completed, a new boss appears on the board at a different spot. Up to five bosses may appear on a board.

In the Mario Shuffle mode, two players race across a linear, one-way board to a goal as amiibo figures. The red team&#x27;s goal is to reach the very right of the board, while the blue team&#x27;s goal is to reach the left side. Players roll two dice each, and when a player crosses an opponent&#x27;s amiibo figure, the player knocks it back to the start of the board. Players can land on spaces that either make their figure continue moving farther on the board or move backwards. If players do not have an amiibo figure, a cardboard cut-out of a character is used instead. A total amount of six characters can be used, each split into two teams of three. The first team who makes it across the board to their goal wins the game.

&quot;Star Rush&quot; also features five other game modes: Coinathlon, Balloon Bash, Rhythm Recital, Challenge Tower, and Boo&#x27;s Block Party. In Coinathlon, up to four players collect as many coins as they can in a set of three sixty-second coin-designated minigames. In Balloon Bash, up to four players collect coins and stars while rolling the Dice Block on a small board with 10, 20, or 30 turns and minigames. In Rhythm Recital, up to four players cooperate and play classic &quot;Mario&quot; tunes by timing touchscreen taps button presses correctly. In Challenge Tower, a single-player mode, the player climbs a tower with LED spaces on it, trying to hit the right colours and avoid Amp enemies. And finally, in the Boo&#x27;s Block Party mode, a puzzle game, players spin the sides of numbered blocks to match them up for points. &quot;Star Rush&quot; also features the Character Museum, which lets players view characters and their biographies, similar to the trophy system in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games.

&quot;IGN&quot; criticized &quot;Mario Party: Star Rush&quot;, criticizing the slow pacing of the gameplay, saying, &quot;but &quot;Mario Party: Star Rush&quot;″s modes all start slow and never find ways to pick up the pace.&quot; It further criticized the board game modes for &quot;[unfolding] nearly the same way every time.&quot; It also mentioned the luck factor of the game, noting &quot;almost everything here hinges on luck, and there are few opportunities for sneaky plays to employ smart strategies to shift its competitive games in your favor. A lot of them boil down to roll the dice and try to make the best of what’s available on the board.&quot; However, it praised the improvements to the sluggish gameplay of the previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games and also praised the &quot;wacky spirit&quot; of the minigames. It did, however, end its review with &quot;After a few trips through &quot;Mario Party: Star Rush&quot;″s modes, you&#x27;ll have seen nearly everything it has to offer.&quot;

&quot;Nintendo Life&quot; noted that &quot;Star Rush&quot;″s modes and minigames are &quot;decent&quot;, noting, &quot;There are some enjoyable highlights, some decent alternatives and one or two outright duds; overall the positive inclusions outweigh the weak points.&quot; It mentioned that there are a limited number of minigames in the standard mode, Toad Scramble, but noted, &quot;they&#x27;re some of the stronger examples in the game and the heat of the battle is rather addictive.&quot; It also noted that Balloon Bash is &quot;the best mode for playing the broadest variety of minigames.&quot; It did, however, explain that the Mario Shuffle mode &quot;feels like an odd misstep&quot; but praised the Boo&#x27;s Block Party mode. Finally, it explained, &quot;Mario Party: Star Rush may not excel in many ways, but it addresses some complaints from past entries and delivers some harmless entertainment.&quot;

==== &quot;Mario Party: The Top 100&quot; (2017) ====

&quot;Mario Party: The Top 100&quot; was the third &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Nintendo 3DS, released in 2017. Unlike traditional &quot;Mario Party&quot; games, &quot;The Top 100&quot; is a compilation of 100 remade minigames originally featured in the previous ten home console games in the series. It features Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, and Rosalina as playable characters. &quot;The Top 100&quot; has the most minigames out of all games in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series.

The main game mode of &quot;The Top 100&quot; is 100 Minigames, where players can play all 100 minigames individually, outside of a board. Its second mode, Minigame Island, is a single-player mode, where Toad is the host. After the player selects their character, they can choose a computer-controlled teammate for two-versus-two minigames. The game&#x27;s third mode is Minigame Match, which serves as the game&#x27;s only board game mode. It plays similarly to Balloon Bash from the previous instalment, &quot;Star Rush&quot;. It is a multiplayer mode where players travel around a small board and roll a Dice Block that determines their movement on the board. In this mode, players need to pop &quot;Star Balloons&quot; across the board; collecting stars is vital to winning the game. &quot;The Top 100&quot;″s next game mode, Championship Battles, is one hosted by Toadette and has players battling other players in random minigames from a &quot;minigame pack&quot;, a concept first introduced in &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;. Whichever player receives the best of three or five rounds wins the mode. &quot;The Top 100&quot;″s final mode, Decathlon, has players play either five or ten minigames against other players. The player earns points depending on how well they played the minigame, rather than whether they won, and the score in the minigame converts to points to the overall score in the mode.

At the beginning of its review, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said, &quot;Just because a game has a great concept, doesn&#x27;t mean the end product will be the same.&quot; It explained that &quot;The Top 100&quot; is &quot;an incredible idea on paper&quot; and cited that it is a &quot;joy&quot; to see the 100 classic minigames return but explained, &quot;the rest of the package nevertheless delivers a lacklustre experience.&quot; It called it a &quot;blast&quot; to play the 100 returning minigames but criticized the small amount of content and the low replay value. It noted that the game accomplished remastering 100 classic minigames &quot;with great results&quot; and called the initial time spent playing the game &quot;an awesome walk through nostalgia lane&quot; but criticized the rest of the game as &quot;a rushed project&quot; and noted that it &quot;fails to live up to its full potential.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Polygon&quot; explained that &quot;The Top 100&quot; &quot;goes hard on the minigames and light on everything else&quot;. It criticized the Minigame Island mode for feeling like &quot;a random, obligatory grind&quot;. It noted that &quot;The Top 100&quot; &quot;does a very good thing by giving us tons of minigames to play&quot; but criticized the structure board game aspect of the game.
==== &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot; (2021) ====

On June 15, 2021, Nintendo announced &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot; for the Nintendo Switch. It is a compilation of 100 classic mini-games and five game boards stretching all the way back to the first &quot;Mario Party&quot; on Nintendo 64, all remade with HD graphics. It includes full online compatibility for playing with both friends and strangers. The game was released on October 29, 2021.

=== Arcade games ===

In addition to the home console games, six arcade games were also developed, and released exclusively in Japan. They typically retain the core mechanics of &quot;Mario Party&quot;, such as moving around a board and playing minigames, but add arcade specific features such as a coin pusher or claw device.

=== Other games ===
==== &quot;Mario Party-e&quot; (2003) ====

&quot;Mario Party-e&quot; is a card game that makes optional use of the Nintendo e-Reader and was released on February 18, 2003. It is the only &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Nintendo e-Reader. Many of these cards contain &quot;dot-codes&quot; that, when scanned into the e-Reader, allow players to play minigames similar to those found in the regular &quot;Mario Party&quot; series. The &quot;Mario Party-e&quot; set contains a Play Mat, an instruction book and a pre-constructed deck consisting of sixty-four cards. An extra card was included as a promotion in an issue of GamePro.

===Aggregate reviews===
=== Sales ===
The &quot;Mario Party&quot; sub-series have generally performed well in sales. &quot;Super Mario Party&quot;, released in 2018, is the series&#x27; best-selling game with 20.66 million units sold, and &quot;Mario Party DS&quot;, released in 2007, is the best-selling portable entry.

=== Controversies ===
==== &quot;Mario Party&quot; (N64) ====
In the original 1998 &quot;Mario Party&quot; game for the Nintendo 64, some minigames required players to rotate the controller&#x27;s analogue stick as fast as they could, including one in which the player is challenged to wind up Fly-Guy at the minigame house. Some players used the palms of their hands, rather than their thumbs, to rotate the analogue stick. As a result, they would often endure blisters. In response, Nintendo gave away free gaming gloves to the victims of these blisters. Some wore away the stick because it was not very durable. The analogue stick rotation has no longer been used since &quot;Mario Party 2&quot;. The exceptions are the mini-game in &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; in which the player only needs to rotate it once and the mini-game in &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; in which players throw Bowser in a manner similar to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and do not need to use the palm of their hand to move the analogue stick. &quot;Mario Party: Island Tour&quot; resumed using these types of minigames because players can spin the Nintendo 3DS&#x27; analogue stick safely. In &quot;Mario Party Superstars&quot;, since the game utilizes analog sticks again, a disclaimer is placed on the rules screen for the minigames Tug o&#x27; War and Cast Aways warning players to not use their palms to turn the stick to avoid hand injury and stick damage. A similar warning appears for the Nintendo Switch Online version of &quot;Mario Party&quot; when starting the game.

==== &quot;Mario Party 8&quot; ====
In July 2007, &quot;Mario Party 8&quot; for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii home console was withdrawn from stores in the United Kingdom shortly after its release date. This was allegedly caused by Kamek using the word &quot;spastic.&quot; Complaints were raised from consumers because the term is used to refer to an intellectually disabled person and is considered highly offensive in the United Kingdom. In August 2007, Nintendo re-released the game, replacing &quot;spastic&quot; with the word &quot;erratic&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Serapis&quot; was a Royal Navy two-decked, fifth rate. Randall &amp; Brent built her at Greenland South Dockyard, Rotherhithe and launched her in 1779. She was armed with 44 guns (twenty 18-pounders, twenty 9-pounders, and four 6-pounders). &quot;Serapis&quot; was named after the god Serapis in Greek and Egyptian mythology. The Americans captured her during the American War of Independence. They transferred her to the French, who commissioned her as a privateer. She was lost off Madagascar in 1781 to a fire.

==American War of Independence==

&quot;Serapis&quot; was commissioned in March 1779 under Captain Richard Pearson. On 23 September she engaged the American warship under the command of Captain John Paul Jones in the North Sea at Flamborough Head, England. At the time of this battle, the ship carried 50 guns, having an extra six 6-pounders. The two vessels exchanged heavy fire and &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; lost most of her firepower, but by attaching the two ships together, Jones was able to overcome much of Pearson&#x27;s advantage of greater firepower (although the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; was a larger ship with a considerably greater crew). The famous quote, &quot;I have not yet begun to fight!&quot; was Jones&#x27;s response to Pearson&#x27;s premature call for &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; to surrender. The battle raged on for three hours as the crew of &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; tenaciously fought &quot;Serapis&quot;, raking her deck with gunfire. Eventually, , a frigate in Jones&#x27;s squadron, began firing at both the attached ships indiscriminately. &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; began to sink, but Captain Pearson, unable to aim his guns at the frigate because he was tied to Jones&#x27;s ship, surrendered, handing &quot;Serapis&quot; over to the Americans.

==Aftermath==
Jones sailed to the neutral Dutch Republic, but diplomatic complications arose because the Dutch authorities did not recognize the United States. Jones renamed his capture &quot;Serapis&quot;. An improvised &quot;Serapis&quot; flag was secretly entered into the Dutch records to avoid the charges of piracy. &quot;Serapis&quot; and her consort, HM hired armed ship , were later declared as French captures.

Although the two British vessels had lost the battle, they had succeeded perfectly in protecting the very valuable convoy, and both captains were well rewarded.

==Loss of &quot;Serapis&quot;==
Between October and December 1779 &quot;Serapis&quot; was in the Texel. By September 1780 she was probably at Lorient.

The French Royal Navy commissioned &quot;Sérapis&quot;, and loaned her to a civilian master named Roche who planned to use the ship against the British in the Indian Ocean.

On 31 July 1781, &quot;Sérapis&quot; was at Madagascar, trading spirits and arak for rice, when the load master, lieutenant de frégate L&#x27;Héritier, had candles taken out of their fire-proof lanterns. The candles ignited alcohol vapour in the hull. The crew fought the fire for two and a half hours, but the flames eventually burned through the walls of the spirit locker and reached a powder magazine. The resulting explosion ripped the stern off the ship, sinking her. While eight men lost their lives, 215 people survived. The privateer &quot;Daliram&quot; returned them to Île Sainte-Marie, Madagascar.

==Discovery of the wreck==
In November 1999, American nautical archeologists Richard Swete and Michael Tuttle located the remains of &quot;Serapis&quot; at Île Sainte-Marie.

<doc id="442596" wikidata="Q1744650" url="?curid=442596" title="Chamaecyparis thyoides">
<text>Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic white cedar, Atlantic white cypress, southern white cedar, whitecedar, or false-cypress), a species of &quot;Cupressaceae&quot;, is native to the Atlantic coast of North America and is found from southern Maine to Georgia and along the Gulf of Mexico coast from Florida to Mississippi. It is one of two species of &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; found in North America. &quot;C. thyoides&quot; resides on the East Coast and &quot;C. lawsoniana&quot; can be found on the West Coast. There are two geographically isolated subspecies, treated by some botanists as distinct species, by others at just varietal rank: &quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides thyoides&quot; and &quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides henryae&quot; (H.L.Li) E.Murray (syn. &quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides&quot; subsp. &quot;henryae&quot; (H.L.Li) Little; &quot;Chamaecyparis henryae&quot; H.L.Li) The species grows in forested wetlands where they tend to dominate the canopy. The trees are associated with a wide variety of other wetland species because of their wide north-south range. The remaining populations are now found mostly in remote locations that would be difficult to harvest, so its popularity as a source of lumber has decreased.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides&quot; grows within 100 miles of the coastline and less than 50 m above sea level along much of the East Coast and Gulf Coast. Rare populations grow in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, where the tree may be found up to 460 m above sea level. Nationally, Atlantic white cedar is protected in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Pinelands National Reserve, Cape Cod National Seashore, Croatan National Forest, Francis Marion National Forest, Ocala National Forest, and Apalachicola National Forest. Altered fire regimes, logging, and draining of wetlands outside of the few protected areas have all contributed to the general decrease in the size and occurrences of Atlantic white cedar stands. The tree is listed as Rare in Georgia and New York, of Special Concern in Maine, and Extirpated in Pennsylvania. In Mississippi, the species is at risk of extirpation as a consequence of overexploitation, changes in land use, and extreme weather events.

&quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides&quot; lives almost exclusively in freshwater wetlands and is considered an obligate wetland species. It prefers habitats where the soil is saturated with water at least during the majority of the growing season. The soils in these regions have a thick organic layer, often classified as a histic surface horizon, with sandy material at greater depths and poor drainage. Atlantic white cedar wetlands are acidic and there is little oxygen stored in the soil because water has displaced the air. Plants that live in these environments must be specially adapted to such conditions.

===Ecology===
Red maple and black gum trees are often found in the canopy along with Atlantic white cedar throughout its range. Sphagnum mosses also often grow in these wetlands. The caterpillar of the Hessel&#x27;s hairstreak butterfly feeds exclusively on &quot;C. thyoides,&quot; where its green color helps to camouflage it.

The trees themselves grow on hummocks, small mounds, with water pooling in the depressions surrounding them. This keeps the tree from being underwater year-round and helps to protect from floods. The tree benefits from periodic low-intensity fires which expose seedlings to sunlight and limit competition with other canopy flora, particularly red maple. Too frequent or intense fires or flooding can damage seedlings stored in the top layer of soil and full-grown trees.

==Description==
&quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides&quot; is an evergreen coniferous tree usually growing to (but may grow up to ) tall with an average diameter of , up to , and feathery foliage in moderately flattened sprays, green to glaucous blue-green in color. The leaves are scale-like, long, and produced in opposite decussate pairs on somewhat flattened shoots; seedlings up to a year old have needle-like leaves. The tree is bare of branches for three-fourths of the trunk height and the bark can be ash-gray to reddish brown. Bark is smooth on juveniles, but mature trees have deep ridges and bark as thick as . &quot;C. thyoides&quot; is monoecious, so a single tree will carry both the pollen and seeds needed for reproduction in cones. The seed cones are globose, diameter, with 6-10 scales (1-2 seeds per scale), green or purple, maturing to brown in 5–7 months after pollination. The pollen cones are yellow but turn brown as the tree matures, long and broad, releasing their yellow pollen once a year in spring. The tree begins bearing seeds at 4–5 years, but does not reach full maturity and start producing cones until it is 10-20 years old. Seeds are dispersed nearly every year and travel by wind. Height and diameter of the tree increase steadily until the tree is 50 years old, at which point height growth slows. Both height and diameter no longer increase once the tree is 100 years old. Stands are generally all younger than 200 years, though some trees as old as 1000 years have been reported. Because they have relatively shallow roots, &quot;C. thyoides&quot; are vulnerable to being blown over by wind.

===Subspecies variation===
*&quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides thyoides&quot;: Leaves and immature cones usually glaucous blue-green; cones mature to dark brown-black; facial leaves flat, not ridged, but with visible glands. 
*&quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides henryae&quot;: Leaves and immature cones green, not glaucous; cones mature to light brown; facial leaves with a longitudinal ridge with glands less obvious or absent.

==Cultivation and uses==

&quot;Chamaecyparis thyoides&quot; is of some importance in horticulture, with several cultivars of varying crown shape, growth rates and foliage color having been selected for garden planting. Named cultivars include &#x27;Aurea&#x27; (yellow foliage), &#x27;Heatherbun&#x27; (dwarf, purple in winter), &#x27;Andelyensis&#x27; (dwarf, dense foliage), &#x27;Ericoides&#x27; (juvenile foliage), and &#x27;Glauca&#x27; (strongly glaucous foliage). In some locations, particularly Mobile County, Alabama, the tree is cultivated as a Christmas tree.

===Wood===
Its wood is considered hardy, as it is resistant to decay and warping in a variety of temperatures and moisture levels. The most common use of white cedar wood is lumber, for which stands usually require 70 years of growth from germination to harvest. The lumber may be used in house construction, though scarcity of Atlantic white cedar makes it difficult to use as the primary material. The wood was favored for roof shingles because it is lightweight, but has since been replaced by cheaper and more fire-resistant materials such as asphalt. The durability of the heartwood makes it popular for use as siding and paneling, and the less resistant sapwood has been used for interior finishes. White cedar lumber has also been used in boat construction, but this requires much older, larger trees. North Carolina is the greatest producer of lumber for boat construction because it has the greatest number of old-growth &quot;C. thyoides&quot; forests. Other uses include fencing, telephone and electric poles, woodenware, duck decoys, lawn furniture, and as Christmas trees.

== Conservation ==
Prior to European colonization of the Americas, there were an estimated of swamps and bogs dominated by stands of Atlantic white cedars. At present, less than still remain. Though the tree is not listed as threatened, Atlantic white cedar wetlands are considered a globally threatened ecosystem, and often serve as carbon sinks because of their peat-building abilities. Since 2012, &quot;ex situ&quot; gene conservation efforts of Atlantic white cedars have been ongoing at North Carolina State University and the United States Forest Service.

<text>HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; was a modified built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Originally planned to be the fourth of the class, she was redesigned to enable her to operate more aircraft, 48 instead of 36. A second hangar was added above the original, raising the flight deck by , although the hangar-side armour had to be reduced to compensate. The lower hangar was made shorter than the upper hangar due to the need for extra workshops and accommodation to support the added aircraft.

==Construction and early history==

&quot;Indomitable&quot; was laid down by Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness, on 10 November 1937. She was launched on 26 March 1940 and commissioned the following year in October. She was christened by Clementine Churchill.

She sailed to the West Indies in November 1941 for her maiden voyage. While there, &quot;Indomitable&quot; ran aground on a coral reef near Jamaica, though she returned to service soon afterwards. This did mean she did not reach Southeast Asia in time to provide air cover for Force Z, a naval force sent to deter the Japanese from attacking Singapore. This force was sunk by Japanese aircraft when the Japanese landed in Malaya in December 1941. The following month, in January 1942, &quot;Indomitable&quot; joined the Eastern Fleet based at Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). At the end of January, she ferried 48 Royal Air Force Hawker Hurricanes to airfields in Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies, to reinforce the air defenses of Singapore, but a large proportion of the Hawker Hurricanes were destroyed on the ground by Japanese air raids. The British commanders in Singapore surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February.

After the fall of Britain&#x27;s remaining Far Eastern colonies Hong Kong and Burma, &quot;Indomitable&quot; was redeployed. A new Eastern Fleet was established under the command of Admiral Sir James Somerville. &quot;Indomitable&quot;, and her sister ship were the only modern aircraft carriers of the Fleet, and were a vital asset to the Allies in the Far East; the only other carrier, , was obsolete.

In April 1942 Somerville attempted to intercept the Japanese carrier strike force during their Indian Ocean raid. Incomplete intelligence led him to abandon his ambush just hours before the Japanese force arrived. Over the next few days &quot;Indomitable&quot; was part of a force that attempted to intercept the Japanese fleet at night, where the slow but radar-equipped British torpedo planes would have the best chance of a successful strike. Despite several days of searching, no decisive action was achieved and Somerville eventually withdrew his fast carriers to Bombay. &quot;Hermes&quot;, the Australian destroyer , the corvette and two heavy cruisers, and , were sunk in action during this Japanese raid, as were a score of merchant ships.

In May 1942 the British launched Operation Ironclad, the invasion of French Madagascar. It was feared that the Japanese would themselves occupy Madagascar and use it as a submarine base to attack Allied convoy routes in the Indian Ocean.

&quot;Indomitable&quot; was detached from the Eastern Fleet to take part in the invasion, rendezvousing with the covering force (which included sister ship ) and the invasion force which had been sent from Durban, South Africa. The assault began on 5 May at Courrier Bay, just west of the actual objective of Diego Suarez. &quot;Indomitable&quot;″s air wing attacked Arrachart airfield on the opening day of the invasion, destroying five Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters and damaging two more as well as two Potez 63.11s. The following day a ground assault began, with &quot;Indomitable&quot;″s Albacores bombing the defences and her Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes flying ground attack sorties. French forces in Diego Suarez surrendered on 7 May. On 8 May, the French submarine attempted to torpedo &quot;Indomitable&quot; but was sunk by depth charges from the destroyers and .

==The Mediterranean==
In July, &quot;Indomitable&quot; returned to the United Kingdom. She was soon back in action, participating in Operation Pedestal, the largest convoy to supply the besieged island of Malta. This convoy comprised 14 cargo ships and an unprecedentedly large escort of warships: , , , &quot;Indomitable&quot;, , , , , , , , and 32 destroyers. One objective was for to launch her Spitfires to land at Malta, where they would remain; this was done on 11 August, and &quot;Furious&quot; returned to Gibraltar.

During the operation &quot;Indomitable&quot; was hit by two 500 kg bombs (by Ju 87s belonging to StG 3) and suffered three near misses. One 500 kg bomb penetrated the unarmoured portion of the flight deck, causing damage that required her to withdraw for repairs, although she was able to steam at fewer than two hours after the hits. Casualties were 6 officers and 40 ratings killed, and 70 ratings wounded. (The attack may be viewed at the seventeen-minute mark of the documentary &quot;Malta Convoy&quot; listed in the external links section). She sailed to Liverpool&#x27;s Gladsone Dock, where repairs were completed in February 1943, after which she worked up off Scapa Flow and in the Clyde area before returning to the Mediterranean in the build-up to Operation Husky.

She was torpedoed by a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 of 204a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; of the 41° Torpedo Bomber Group on 16 July while supporting the buildup for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) and returned again to the United States, where repairs were completed. She commenced sea trials 10 April 1944.

==The Far East==
&quot;Indomitable&quot; returned to the Eastern Fleet in early 1944. She and &quot;Victorious&quot; launched bombers against Sumatra in August and September. They later bombed the Nicobar Islands, after which &quot;Indomitable&quot; joined up with &quot;Illustrious&quot; to attack Medan and Sumatra again on 20 December. The following year, &quot;Indomitable&quot; joined the British Pacific Fleet. On 4 January 1945 she, her sister ship &quot;Victorious&quot; and another fleet carrier attacked Medan. Subsequent actions were taken against Palembang and Sumatra, later in January. On 4 May 1945 she was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, but her armoured flight deck saved her from serious damage. In August, with the war ending, &quot;Indomitable&quot; supported the liberation of Hong Kong, arriving after a landing party from had taken the Japanese surrender. Her aircraft flew the carrier&#x27;s last combat missions of the war and of her career on 31 August and 1 September against Japanese suicide boats which were attacking British forces.

==Post-war==
&quot;Indomitable&quot; returned to the UK in November 1945. The following year she carried the Great Britain national rugby league team to Australia on their first post-war tour, earning the team the nickname, &#x27;The Indomitables&#x27;. In 1947, she was placed in reserve, and then given a refit that took three years, from 1947 to 1950. Late in her refit her boilers were discovered to have only 10 years of life, and the engine spaces had to be torn apart and rebuilt to replace the boilers. Upon the completion of her refit she returned to operational duty with the Home Fleet in far cooler climates than her wartime operations. She was unique in carrying the day-and-night de Havilland Hornet fighter, and the navalised Sea Hornet NF.12 radar-equipped night fighter also carried by in 1951–53, which was faster and longer-ranged compared to the carrier&#x27;s Blackburn Firebrand torpedo strike aircraft.

In 1951, &quot;Indomitable&quot; replaced the Royal Navy&#x27;s last battleship, , as the Home Fleet flagship. On 3 February 1953, she was badly damaged by an internal fire and explosion, the damage was later covered in concrete and never repaired. In the same year, she sailed to take part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. She then did deck landings in the Channel the same month, with the prototype mirror landing light setup to make the landing of faster jet aircraft more efficient and safer replacing the batsman. &quot;Indomitable&quot; was not modernized for several reasons, chief of which was that to make her capable of handling jet aircraft, her hangar height would have to be increased from to . This would require tearing the ship down to the hangar deck itself. Given the escalating costs of the modernization of her half-sister &quot;Victorious&quot;, the Admiralty decided against a complete modernization for a ship of her age.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Indomitable&quot; returned to the reserve fleet, and in October 1953 she was placed in unmaintained reserve. She was sold for scrap and arrived at Faslane for breaking up on 30 September 1955.

<text>The Cone of Silence is one of many recurring joke devices from &quot;Get Smart&quot;, a 1960s American comedy television series about an inept spy. The essence of the joke is that the apparatus, designed for secret conversations, makes it impossible for those inside the device – and easy for those outside the device – to hear the conversation.

==History==

The larger, plastic version of the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot; appeared in &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot;, which aired on September 18, 1965. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, the original screenwriters for the series, devised many of the running jokes. The Cone of Silence scene was shot ahead of the rest of the pilot episode, and was used to sell the series to NBC.

<doc id="442604" wikidata="Q1658320" url="?curid=442604" title="76 (gas station)">
<text>76 (formerly Union 76) is a chain of gas stations located within the United States. The 76 brand is owned by Phillips 66. Unocal, the original owner and creator of the 76 brand, merged with Chevron Corporation in 2005.

== History ==

The Union Oil Company of California (later known as Unocal) introduced the &quot;Union 76&quot; brand to their existing Union Oil service stations in 1932. After expanding along the West Coast, the &quot;Union 76&quot; brand expanded to the Midwest and Southeast through the acquisition of Pure Oil in 1965.

In 1989, Unocal began to gradually exit the Midwest and Eastern markets by forming a joint venture with PDVSA, called Uno-Ven, in which Unocal contributed its Midwest refining and marketing assets. Unocal sold its interest in Uno-Ven to PDVSA in 1997 and PDVSA rebranded the Midwestern and Eastern Union 76 stations to its Citgo brand.

In 1997, Unocal also sold its remaining refining and marketing operations in the western United States and the rights to the Union 76 brand for use in refining and marketing operations to Tosco. Four years later, Phillips Petroleum purchased Tosco along with the 76 brand in 2001. Phillips merged with Conoco the following year to form ConocoPhillips.

In 2012, ConocoPhillips divested its refining and marketing business, which included the 76 brand, through the formation of Phillips 66.

In 2016, Saudi Aramco-owned Motiva Enterprises signed a deal with Phillips 66 Company which would allow Motiva to use the 76 brand on some of its stations in its 26 eastern and Gulf Coast states operating territory. By 2017, the 76 brand was reintroduced into New York, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee and New Jersey.

==Marketing==
76, Conoco, and Phillips 66 market their brand of gasoline under the brand name PROclean. The previous brand name for their gasoline was Propower. 76 gasoline stopped being marketed under the Propower name after the termination of the commercial relationship between NASCAR and 76 after the end of the 2003 season, when the firm discontinued all motorsport fuels. As of October 2004, PROclean brand fuel was included on the list of fuels recognized as &quot;Top Tier&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the company used the slogan &quot;Go With the Spirit...the Spirit of &#x27;76.&quot; This was later shortened to &quot;Get the Spirit&quot;. Their current (as of late 2021) slogan is “We’re on the driver’s side”.

==The orange ball==

Union Oil, for many years based in El Segundo, California, introduced &quot;76&quot; gasoline in 1932. The name referred to the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, and was also the octane rating of the gasoline in 1932.

76 signs are orange balls with a 76 legend in blue. During the 1960s and &#x27;70s, most stations had the 76 ball rotate when the signs were illuminated. The first such sign was designed in 1962 by advertising creative director Ray Pedersen for the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair.

In 2005, new corporate owners ConocoPhillips began a rebranding campaign to unify the design elements of each of the merged brands (76, Phillips, and Conoco), which included replacing all the orange-ball signs with monument-style signs in the red-orange and blue color scheme. In response to negative publicity generated by a grassroots &quot;Save The 76 Ball&quot; campaign, ConocoPhillips reversed this decision in January 2007, and agreed to donate several classic orange 76 balls to museums and to erect approximately 100 balls in the new red-orange and blue color scheme.

The 76 ball is a popular logo in the &quot;Cult Style&quot; of European car tuning (especially on Volkswagen Golf Mk1 GTIs, due to the debut year of 1976), and it is used on clothing items in Japan as of 2005.

Until the end of 2003, 76 &quot;spotters&quot; balls were located at the Daytona International Speedway in all four turns as well as at other NASCAR tracks. They were used as scoring points, had portholes, and were capable of holding a few people inside. The first of these balls was placed inside the second story of the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte. Another was given to the owner of The Brumos Collection in Jacksonville, Florida, and sits prominently on display outside the front grounds. Dale Earnhardt Jr. acquired the 76 ball from North Wilkesboro Speedway and displays it with a vintage 76 gas station on his &quot;Whiskey River&quot; property. Similar balls were near pit entrances at most NASCAR circuits until the sponsorship ended, but unlike spheres, they were flat on both sides and illuminated at night during races.
The 76 ball is also a landmark that sits atop Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, where the only gas station on the premises of a Major League ballpark is visible from the park beyond the outfield stands. The gas station is no longer active and has been converted into an event space. 76 ball logos also adorn the baseball field&#x27;s on-deck circles. Union Oil was a longtime sponsor of the Dodgers baseball team, beginning with their relocation to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958. The sponsorship by the 76 brand continues to this day.

Beginning in 1967, Union 76 distributed tens of millions of small orange foam balls with the 76 logo, meant to be impaled on the radio antenna of a car. These were popular especially in the Greater Los Angeles area, where they are still seen. In the winter of 1968, wind and snow created drifts in Spokane, Washington made it difficult to locate cars without whip antennas and the orange 76 ball on them.

In recent years, 76 has appeared in certain areas in the eastern United States, as part of a licensing deal with Motiva Enterprises. Since 2013, they have returned to the orange ball imagery as part of the &quot;Experience 76&quot; program.

Some stations with the full orange ball sign place special hoods over them for Halloween to make them look like jack-o&#x27;-lanterns.

<doc id="442606" wikidata="Q6908256" url="?curid=442606" title="Moore desk">
<text>A Moore desk is not one but two large antique desk forms.

The &quot;Moore Office Queen&quot; is a massive desk, made for a sitting user. From the outside it looks, when closed, much like its competitor, the Wooton desk but it differs from it in several ways. For one, it has but a single large door to lock up the main work surface and the drawers and nooks around it, while the Wooton has two. More importantly (the manufacturer liked to boast about it) the main work surface slides in and out of the main body of the desk so that work can be stopped and the desk closed without having to put away everything, as is the case for the Wooton desk.

The &quot;Moore Office Queen&quot; was patented in 1878 in Indiana in the United States by the Moore Combination Desk Company. 

The Office Queen has a modern descendant called the armoire desk.

The &quot;Moore Insurance Desk&quot; is nearly twice as big as the &quot;Office Queen&quot; and combines a standing desk and a normal &quot;sitting&quot; desk in a single piece of furniture. It was patented in 1882. Like the &quot;Office Queen&quot; it opens up by means of a single large door, and its internal work surface slides in and out. But it also has an external work surface to accommodate a standing user, on the other side of the desk. The standing user employs the &quot;roof&quot; of the desk of the sitting user as his (or her) work surface.

Moore combination desks were produced in standard, extra, and superior grades. Standard grade combination desks were $110 to $185. Extra grade desks were 40% to 50% more expensive. Superior were more expensive.

In her Smithsonian monography on the Wooton desk, Betty Lawson Walters notes the relative importance of the Moore desk as a competitor to the famous Wooton desk, and traces its origin and destiny.

<doc id="442612" wikidata="Q2469860" url="?curid=442612" title="Tomonobu Itagaki">
<text>(born April 1, 1967) is a Japanese video game designer best known for creating the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series and also reviving the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; franchise in 2004. In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

Joining Tecmo in 1992, Itagaki produced two video game franchises that were commercial successes and earned him several promotions; he headed Tecmo&#x27;s development team, Team Ninja, and sat on the executive board. He left the company in June 2008 after 16 years of service, filing a lawsuit against it for withholding bonus pay. He formed a new company Valhalla Game Studios with several Team Ninja members and released &quot;Devil&#x27;s Third&quot;. The company dissolved in December 2021 and he has now formed a new one called Itagaki Games.

At its inception, Itagaki said Itagaki Games would release its first game for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. In early October 2024, it was mistakenly announced Itagaki Games was being dissolved like Valhalla Game Studios. This was an error as a result of the studio being renamed to Itagaki Games Co., Ltd. in September 2024. As of this time, the studio remains in operation under this new title.

==Personal life==
Born and raised in Tokyo, Tomonobu Itagaki graduated from Waseda University Senior High School in March 1985. He enrolled in Waseda University and graduated from its School of Law in 1992.

Itagaki is married and has a daughter, whom he has mentioned as one of the primary influences on his projects, including developing &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot; for the Nintendo DS, and a constant gaming partner in games like the &quot;Halo&quot; series. Itagaki has in his office a set of &quot;katana&quot; Japanese swords his father made for him, which he tends to take out to show to his visitors. As he wishes to stop people from reading his expressions during gambling-type games, he is always seen wearing sunglasses, a habit that has become his trademark in the video game community.

==Career==
Itagaki joined Tecmo in 1992 as a graphics programmer, and initially worked on the Super Famicom version of the American football video game, &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot;. His career breakthrough came in 1996 with his first &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; game, a game based on Sega Model 2 hardware (&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;) created in response to Tecmo management&#x27;s request. He was mentored by Yoshiaki Inose (of &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Key&quot;, &quot;Bomb Jack&quot;, &quot;Rygar&quot; and original &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; fame) and Akihiko Shimoji (&quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot;) in his early years at Tecmo, and learned from them to include fun as a necessary component in his projects.

His rise through the company had been steady since then. He was appointed as the head of the third creative department in April 2001. He then assumed the post of Team Ninja Leader in July 2001. Tecmo appointed him as an executive officer in June 2004. He later assumed the position of general manager of the high-end production department in February, 2006. His Executive Officer position was however taken away in August the same year, due to him being accused of sexual harassment. He was later judged innocent by a Tokyo district court in June 2007.

The release of &quot;Dead or Alive 2&quot; had greatly increased the series popularity, as well as Itagaki&#x27;s. He had sought to create fighting games with details he felt were lacking in other games. In the later iterations, Itagaki has built the story of the games around themes of family - Kasumi and Ayane in &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;, and Helena in &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot;. To date, the series has gone through four iterations with various enhanced editions. A fifth iteration, &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, was made in his absence and released in September 2012. &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot; received two additional releases of the base title; &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate&quot;, which released in September 2013, a year after the original release. The second and final iteration of the game was titled &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Last Round&quot; and released in February 2015. Given the success of &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, Team Ninja created a sequel, also without Itagaki&#x27;s inclusion, and &quot;Dead or Alive 6&quot; released in March 2019 and is currently the latest release in the franchise.

In the &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; series, Itagaki brought together the girls of &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; onto an island. The player is to foster good relationship between the girls to create a harmonious winning beach volleyball duo. In the second iteration of the series, the focus is shifted by expanding the number of activities the player can have the girls take part in. He explains the core of the game as a paradise where the player can watch the girls they &#x27;love&#x27; enjoy simple activities.

&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; was Itagaki&#x27;s effort to develop a game centered on violent gameplay, with super ninja Ryu Hayabusa as the protagonist. Capitalizing on the brand name of the earlier NES series, Itagaki developed a critically acclaimed action-adventure game for the Xbox which also had an international online tournament held for it. He continued work on it to release &quot;Ninja Gaiden Black&quot; as the opus of his &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; work. He continued the series on the Nintendo DS with &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot;, partly due to a promise made to his daughter. At the same time, he brought the series&#x27; next chapter onto the Xbox 360 as &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot;.

Itagaki claims to be one of the very few in the Japanese video game industry to establish communications with the Western world. He suggests other Japanese developers should do like-wise and be aware of the gaming tastes outside Japan, so as to be able to reverse the Japanese gaming industry slump of 2005.

On June 2, 2008, just before the release of &quot;Ninja Gaiden II&quot; for the Xbox 360, Itagaki announced that he was resigning from Tecmo and was suing the company for withholding a bonus promised for his previous works. He was also suing Tecmo&#x27;s president Yoshimi Yasuda for damages based on &quot;unreasonable and statements&quot; made in front of Itagaki&#x27;s colleagues. In an interview with 1up.com, Itagaki has revealed that he is working on a project with former members of Team Ninja under a new studio, Valhalla Game Studios. The title in question, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Third&quot;, was revealed shortly before E3 2010.

In January 2021, Itagaki announced that he has established a new game studio, Itagaki Games, and stated that he would be interested in working with Microsoft again.

==Works==
==Design approach==
===Game design philosophy===
Itagaki believes a good game should be an integrated product of good graphics, interactivity, and playability. He also places a high priority on ensuring his games are interactive with the player&#x27;s actions and respond quickly to the player&#x27;s inputs. It is this opinion which led to his derogatory statements on &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;. He finds the payoff for the game&#x27;s button-prompting sequences to be less fulfilling than that of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s (whose sequences he calls dumb, but entertaining). Likewise, he cited &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; as games lacking the interactivity appealing to him.

Itagaki professes a liking for simplicity of inputs, he states too many inputs would result in the loss of the gaming experience. As such, he respects Sega-AM2 for their work on &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;, while maintaining his claim that &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; is still a better game. Likewise, he deplores implementing scenarios to show off technology just for the sake of it, sarcastically asking what is the point of cutting down &quot;thousand heads of cabbages on screen.&quot; In his integration mindset, everything (graphics, controllers, interactiveness, responsiveness, etc.) has its place, even CG pre-rendered cutscenes which he says can deliver a better cinematic experience of some scenes than doing them in real-time.

===Opinions on hardware===
As a game developer, Itagaki has defined his philosophy as being able to extract the strengths of a game machine, and integrate them together to develop games to a level no one else can reach. He defines a game developer&#x27;s satisfaction with a game machine as dependent upon these criteria. With this philosophy, he continually expresses happiness in developing on the Xbox 360, proclaiming it to be more &#x27;software friendly&#x27; than the PlayStation 3. Furthermore, he admires the Nintendo Wii&#x27;s dedication to innovation, which he holds in high regard for the spirit of gaming. Itagaki claimed that he wanted to develop his games for the Xbox 360. He viewed the Xbox 360 as the most powerful console on the market at the time of its design.

Itagaki has also spoken of his handheld philosophy which goes for responsiveness and physical interaction, instead of raw hardware power. As such, Itagaki refuses to make a handheld game for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), stating it goes against the design philosophy of being a handheld device. He says a game created, based on the specifications of the PSP, would be more suited for a true home console. This view is reflected in his statements on why &quot;Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword&quot; as a handheld game has to be designed to take advantage of the Nintendo DS&#x27; touchpad rather than conventional inputs which would have rendered it a typical game.

===Pet projects===
Itagaki classifies his projects into core projects (for business and technical excellence purposes), and those purely for self-fulfillment. The &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; series and &quot;Dead or Alive: Code Chronos&quot; fall into the latter. The &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; games are just meant for simple fun, and to fulfill a &#x27;love&#x27; for the female characters, letting the player nurture and watch the girls partaking in simple joys. Even though he admits to there being sexual content in the game, Itagaki refuses to create scenarios which he feels are vulgar for his &#x27;daughters&#x27;, a term he uses to call the female characters. &quot;Code Chronos&quot; falls into the same category of development, developed as Itagaki&#x27;s hobby for style.

===Work ethics===
Itagaki is thorough with his games, working on them from start to release, and even post release to correct what he feels are deficiencies, and polish them up to their full potential. He has shown this in his project developments, such as pushing back the release of &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; just to polish the game based on feedback of top Japanese &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; players recruited to test it out. For &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, he wanted to leave the best and the ultimate action game on the Xbox before moving on to the Xbox 360, thus he reworked the game and integrated the additional downloadable content to produce &quot;Ninja Gaiden Black&quot;. With &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 2&quot;, he chose to patch an easy-cash exploit rather than leaving it alone and ruminating over the consequences.

Itagaki creates his game characters by immersing himself in their roles and the games. This is a reason why he objects to the suggestion of Kasumi in the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; universe, saying her &#x27;soft&#x27; nature is conflicting with the &#x27;hard-edged&#x27; nature of the game whereas Ayane perfectly fits in. It is this role immersion which helps him to develop and exclude guns from the moveset of the Spartan named Nicole in &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot;. However, immersing himself in the games&#x27; atmosphere has also failed him at times. The Butt Battle, and Tug-of-War of &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme 2&quot; were heavily panned on the basis of minigame design. Itagaki defended those games as nostalgia comedic pieces, meant to make the player remember the celebrity games played on Japanese television.

In 2006, various gaming sites reported that an unnamed female former Tecmo employee had filed a sexual harassment suit against Itagaki. She claimed that Itagaki had made several unwanted sexual advances on her since 2003. While Itagaki admitted to kissing her, he claimed that whatever had gone between them had been consensual. Tecmo&#x27;s ensuing investigation reached the conclusion that &quot;the allegations in question were a result of the former employee&#x27;s desire to vent frustration over her own personal affair, and not indicative of sexual harassment.&quot; Tecmo has also demoted Itagaki and the accuser for their mingling of &quot;personal affairs with their corporate responsibilities&quot;. Meanwhile, the court has found Itagaki innocent of the charges.

===Frank personality===
Itagaki values frank and &quot;to the point&quot; attitudes, believing anything else would allow &quot;quibbles and sectionalists&quot; to come in and derail the train of thought. His frank attitude is also in line with his admitted aggression, taking criticisms as challenges to overcome instead of something to mope over. This relates to his desire for challenges, producing games like &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; which are acknowledged as &#x27;hard&#x27; by the gaming industry, and to push himself to produce games which can contend as the best games of the genre. He openly claims to be the sole creative force behind his projects, as well as being able to convey his plan clearly for the team to understand. He bemoans that the Japanese are starting to forget the basic concepts, closing off their minds to outside criticisms.

Itagaki has consistently given harsh opinions on Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken&quot; games, mainly due to his grudge against the company for its insulting radio commercial on his &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; game. He has stated he never forgets an insult to his family, and will retaliate with &quot;nuclear missiles more than 100 times for that&quot;. This along with what he views as &quot;Tekken&quot;&#x27;s stagnation in the fighting game genre (starting from &quot;Tekken 4&quot;), led him to condemn the &quot;Tekken&quot; series, placing it as his top five hated games, in spite of him stating &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 3&quot; were good games which his family enjoyed.

<doc id="442617" wikidata="Q2046743" url="?curid=442617" title="Catechu">
<text>Catechu ( or ) is an extract of acacia trees used variously as a food additive, astringent, tannin, and dye. It is extracted from several species of Acacia, but especially &quot;Senegalia catechu&quot; (previously called &quot;Acacia catechu&quot;), by boiling the wood in water and evaporating the resulting brew. The Malay name is the basis of the Latinized &quot;catechu&quot; chosen as the Linnaean taxonomy name of the plant species which provides the extract.

==Uses==
As an astringent it has been used since ancient times in Ayurvedic medicine as well as in breath-freshening spice mixtures—for example in France and Italy it is used in some licorice pastilles. It is also an important ingredient in South Asian cooking paan mixtures, such as ready-made paan masala and gutka.

The catechu mixture is high in natural vegetable tannins (which accounts for its astringent effect), and may be used for the tanning of animal hides. Early research by Humphry Davy in the early 19th century first demonstrated the use of catechu in tanning over more expensive and traditional oak extracts.

Under the name &quot;cutch&quot;, it is a brown dye used for tanning and dyeing and for preserving fishing nets and sails. Cutch will dye wool, silk, and cotton a yellowish-brown. Cutch gives gray-browns with an iron mordant and olive-browns with a copper mordant.

Black catechu has recently also been used by Blavod Drinks Ltd. to dye their vodka black.

White cutch, also known as gambier, gambeer, or gambir, which is extracted from &quot;Uncaria gambir&quot; has the same uses. Palm-catechu is extracted from the seeds of &quot;Areca catechu&quot;.

== Derivative chemicals ==

The catechu extract gave its name to the catechin and catechol chemical families first derived from it.

<text>The ZMC-2 (Zeppelin Metal Clad 200,000 cubic foot capacity) was the only successfully operated metal-skinned airship ever built. Constructed at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile by The Aircraft Development Corporation of Detroit, the ZMC-2 was operated by the U.S. Navy at Lakehurst, New Jersey from 1929 until its scrapping in 1941. While at Lakehurst it completed 752 flights, and logged 2265 hours of flight time.

==Operations==
The airship was first flown on August 19, 1929, and transferred to Lakehurst, New Jersey in October 1929. The airship was nicknamed &quot;the Tin Blimp&quot;. Its first Navy skipper was Red Dugan, who expressed reluctance at operating the airship, believing it unsafe. Dugan&#x27;s concerns were proven wrong, though he later lost his life in the crash of another airship, &quot;Akron&quot;.

It was considered very successful as a sub-scale test vehicle, but the company that built it did not weather the Great Depression well, and by the time a successor might have been built, there was little interest in pursuing it. In the year before the Depression, the U.S. Army was seeking funding for an airship based on the ZMC-2, that would have been larger than the German &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, and powered by eight engines of }. The U.S. Army planned to use it as a tender for air-launched aircraft, similar to plans the U.S. Navy had for future dirigibles. The $4.5 million need for construction was never approved by Congress.

The ZMC-2 was operated with a zero internal pressure at speeds up to , sufficient for it to be considered a &#x27;rigid&#x27; airship. With its low fineness ratio of 2.83, the ZMC-2 was difficult to fly. By 1936, the airship had travelled over with little sign of corrosion. In its lifetime the ZMC-2 logged 752 flights and 2265 hours of flight time. In its final years its use had dropped significantly. Between December 1938 and April 1941 it only logged five hours of flight time.

Considered by the Navy as too small for anti-submarine patrols, the aging ZMC-2 was decommissioned and scrapped in 1941 after nearly 12 years of service.

<text>Joseph Lyburn Arthur (born September 28, 1971) is an American singer-songwriter and artist from Akron, Ohio. He is best known for his solo material, and as a member of Fistful of Mercy and RNDM. Arthur has built his reputation over the years through critically acclaimed releases and constant touring; his unique solo live performances often incorporate the use of a number of distortion and loop pedals, and his shows are recorded live at the soundboard and made available to concertgoers immediately following the show on recordable media.

Arthur was discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-1990s, and signed to Gabriel&#x27;s Real World label as the first North American artist on the label&#x27;s roster. Arthur released his debut album, &quot;Big City Secrets&quot; (1997), and follow-up, &quot;Come to Where I&#x27;m From&quot; (2000), on Real World before signing with various independent labels between 2002 and 2006. He established his own record label, Lonely Astronaut Records, in 2006, and released two studio albums, &quot;Let&#x27;s Just Be&quot; (2007) and &quot;Temporary People&quot; (2008) with backing band The Lonely Astronauts. Arthur subsequently returned to performing and recording as a solo artist, releasing &quot;The Graduation Ceremony&quot; in 2011 and the double album, &quot;Redemption City&quot; in 2012.

In 2013, Arthur started a Pledge Music campaign to fund the release of his tenth studio album, &quot;The Ballad of Boogie Christ&quot;. The album was released on June 11, 2013.

Arthur is also an acclaimed painter and designer; his artwork has appeared on all of his releases, with the sleeve design for his 1999 extended play &quot;Vacancy&quot; being nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

==Musical career==
===Early life and &quot;Big City Secrets&quot;===
Arthur began writing and playing music in his early teens, after inheriting an electronic keyboard from his aunt. At age 16, he played bass in a blues band called Frankie Starr and the Chill Factor, which disbanded by 1995. Initially, Arthur sought to become a noted bass guitarist, stating: &quot;I never started singing until I was in my early 20s. I remember thinking, &#x27;OK – I am not a singer, I am a musician.&#x27; I wanted to be this like heroic bass player so I listened to people like Jaco Pastorius, to &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; over and over again. And then like Nirvana came out and I was blown away and then I got into Bob Dylan. Around that time I started playing acoustic guitar and realized I could actually write songs if I wasn&#x27;t playing complicated bass lines.&quot;

Arthur graduated from Firestone High School in 1990 and continued developing his music. In the early 1990s, Arthur relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, continuing to record home demos, playing local clubs and working as a guitar salesman at Clark Music Store.

In 1996, Peter Gabriel&#x27;s A&amp;R associate Harvey Schwartz presented Gabriel with a demo of Arthur&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Cut and Blind&quot; which was given to him by Mikel K, the man in which the third song on Big City Secrets was named. Gabriel and Schwartz arranged a live audition at &quot;The Fez&quot; nightclub in New York City, and Arthur flew up from Atlanta. The night was a success; not only was Lou Reed a guest in the audience, but within a few months Arthur was officially signed, making him the first American recording artist signed to Gabriel&#x27;s label. Arthur recorded his debut album at Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios in England with producer Markus Dravs (Björk, Coldplay, Arcade Fire). The debut album &quot;Big City Secrets&quot; was released worldwide in spring 1997, and Arthur joined Gabriel&#x27;s WOMAD tour in Europe. &quot;Big City Secrets&quot; displayed Arthur&#x27;s often angsty and emotionally wrought lyrics coupled with diverse instrumentation, which he himself described as &quot;someone struggling to heal over experimental folk-rock&quot;, but went virtually unnoticed by the mainstream. Two years later, he recorded an EP called &quot;Vacancy&quot;, which earned him a Grammy nomination in 2000 for best recording package.

===2000–2003: &quot;Come to Where I&#x27;m From&quot; and &quot;Redemption&#x27;s Son&quot;===
In April 2000, Arthur released his sophomore studio album &quot;Come to Where I&#x27;m From&quot;, which was co-produced with T-Bone Burnett and Tchad Blake. The album exhibited a more polished and accessible sound, and received positive accolades from Pitchfork Media and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Arthur began playing for larger audiences, opening for Ben Harper and Gomez. During that same period, he released a promotional live album recorded at the Gypsy Tea Room bar in Dallas, Texas.

After releasing a series of four EPs called &quot;Junkyard Hearts&quot;, which were only available to purchase at his live shows, his third album, &quot;Redemption&#x27;s Son&quot;, came out in May 2002 in the UK. The American release was delayed until November 2002 since Arthur had been dropped by EMI in North America, having been picked up by Universal Music Group imprint Enjoy Records. The double album furthered the themes of emotional and spiritual dislocation found on &quot;Come to Where I&#x27;m From&quot;, and was described by Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek as a &quot;sleeper hit&quot;.

While on tour, Arthur regularly released recordings of his performances soon after each show. He also recorded an album with alternative rock side project Holding the Void, featuring himself on vocals and guitar, Pat Sansone on vocals and bass, and Rene Lopez on vocals and drums. In Summer 2003, he toured with Tracy Chapman in the US.

===2004–2006: &quot;Our Shadows Will Remain&quot;===
Arthur signed a new recording contract with Vector Recordings and began recording his fourth studio album, &quot;Our Shadows Will Remain&quot; across New Orleans, New York City, London, and Prague. The album was released in September 2004, and was Arthur&#x27;s first album to feature string arrangements, provided by the City of Prague Philharmonic. The album was released to widespread critical acclaim; Allmusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek awarded the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising that, &quot;Arthur is in a class of his own and &quot;Our Shadows Will Remain&quot; is a monstrous, memorable outing, his finest moment in a career that is thus far full of them.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an A rating, hailing the album as &quot;especially forceful and cohesive&quot;; &quot;The Guardian&quot; hailed that Joseph &quot;might just be a genuine mad genius&quot;; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; gave the album an A− rating; and Chris Rubin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Our Shadows Will Remain&quot; as the number 1 album of the year 2004 in the year-end critics&#x27; pick list.

Arthur toured the US alone and with Joan Wasser to promote the album, and a new EP called &quot;And the Thieves Are Gone&quot;, which collected unreleased tracks from the &quot;Shadows&quot; recording sessions, came out in December. Shortly afterward, Arthur went on a brief tour of Europe with R.E.M. &quot;Our Shadows Will Remain&quot; was picked up by 14th Floor Records for distribution in the United Kingdom in 2005, which yielded the release of four singles: &quot;Can&#x27;t Exist&quot; in July, &quot;Even Tho&quot; in September, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Broom&quot; in February 2006 to coincide with his first headlining appearance at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, and a reissue of &quot;Can&#x27;t Exist&quot; in May 2006, although none of the singles charted on the UK Singles Chart.

In August 2006, Joseph was invited to help launch the project A River Blue, where a group of young people in northern Uganda were brought together to participate in a music, drama, and art festival. Joseph also recorded the song &quot;A River Blue&quot; for the foundation.

===2006–2007: Lonely Astronaut Records, &quot;Nuclear Daydream&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Just Be&quot;===
In 2006, Arthur started the record label Lonely Astronaut Records with longtime professional partner Lauren Pattenaude. He released a book entitled &quot;We Almost Made It&quot;, a visual collection of his artworks, along with an accompanying instrumental CD titled &quot;The Invisible Parade&quot; in May 2006. In September 2006, Arthur released his fifth studio album, &quot;Nuclear Daydream&quot;, which was recorded in Berlin and Los Angeles. The album would be the first release on his new label. Joseph then embarked on a worldwide tour with his new backing band, The Lonely Astronauts.

His song &quot;In the Sun&quot; was covered by Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Chris Martin of Coldplay in 2006 for a Hurricane Katrina relief EP. The EP includes six versions of the song, one featuring Arthur himself singing with Stipe and another remixed by Justin Timberlake, and is available only on iTunes. On March 26, 2007, Joseph&#x27;s then-UK label 14th Floor Records released a re-recorded version of his 2002 song &quot;Honey and the Moon&quot; as a special single in the UK only. In April, he released his sixth studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Just Be&quot;, and embarked on an extensive US tour. This was Joseph&#x27;s first album with The Lonely Astronauts; the band recorded as many as 80 songs in late 2006, with only sixteen appearing on the album. The album was released to lukewarm critical reception, with Pitchfork Media calling the album &quot;unfocused&quot; and &quot;sloppy&quot;, summarizing that the album &quot;sounds like it came together on the fly, in jam sessions that didn&#x27;t stem from any kind of solid idea.&quot;

In 2007, Joseph contributed vocals to the track &quot;Aggro&quot; from The Ideal Condition by Paul Hartnoll.

===&quot;Temporary People&quot; and solo EPs (2008–2009)===
In 2008, Arthur released four EPs in a four-month span: &quot;Could We Survive&quot; on March 18, &quot;Crazy Rain&quot; on April 15, &quot;Vagabond Skies&quot; on June 10, and &quot;Foreign Girls&quot; on July 8. Regarding these releases, Arthur noted, &quot;I have so much music piled up, like strange animals in a cosmic cage begging for release. The jails were overcrowded. I had to let some of them go.&quot; He played seven solo shows during the SXSW 2008 Festival, six in Austin and one in Dallas. Live dates in Europe and an extensive US solo tour coincided with the new releases. &quot;Temporary People&quot;, his seventh full-length studio album and second with The Lonely Astronauts, was released on September 30, 2008. The album was received warmly by critics, with &quot;The Times Online&quot; stating that it &quot;evokes the loose, rocking swagger and country melancholy of early-1970s Stones&quot;, and Crawdaddy! noting that Arthur &quot;treats his audience to a brawny and brooding rock album, notching his most fully realized LP to date in the process.&quot; The album came out in Europe in late October, and afterward Arthur embarked on a solo tour and opened for Tracy Chapman on her six-week &quot;Our Bright Future&quot; European tour, followed by tour dates in Canada.

Arthur recorded a cover of The Afghan Whigs&#x27;s &quot;Step into the Light&quot; from their 1996 album &quot;Black Love&quot; for the tribute album, &quot;Summer&#x27;s Kiss: A Tribute to The Afghan Whigs&quot;. Following UK tour dates with The Lonely Astronauts in July, Arthur embarked on a solo tour of France in October 2009. A reissue of his 2006 album &quot;Nuclear Daydream&quot; with six previously unreleased bonus tracks was released during this tour.

===Fistful of Mercy, &quot;The Graduation Ceremony&quot;, &quot;Redemption City&quot;, and RNDM (2010–2012)===
Arthur, Ben Harper, and Dhani Harrison formed the supergroup trio Fistful of Mercy in 2010, and their debut album &quot;As I Call You Down&quot; was released on October 5, 2010. Arthur&#x27;s first solo studio album since &quot;Nuclear Daydream&quot;, titled &quot;The Graduation Ceremony&quot;, was released on May 23, 2011.

In 2012, Arthur released a double album, &quot;Redemption City&quot;, and collaborated with Pearl Jam&#x27;s Jeff Ament in the band, RNDM.

===&quot;The Ballad of Boogie Christ&quot; (2013)===
In 2013, Arthur began using Pledge Music to fund the release of his new studio album, &quot;The Ballad of Boogie Christ&quot;. In a statement, Arthur noted, &quot;With the music business being what it is nowadays, unless you break out big or become a license darling, there are precious few alternatives to fund one&#x27;s work. Some say it&#x27;s sad that it has come to this but I&#x27;m optimistic that new ways of doing things can lead to new forms of creativity and a smaller world community for artists to get to know their fans or for fans to become a more vital part in the process of artists creating their diamonds.&quot;

===&quot;Lou&quot; (2014)===
Following Lou Reed&#x27;s death, Arthur released an album of covers of his songs.

===&quot;Days of Surrender&quot; (2015)===
Arthur&#x27;s liner notes for the record are as follows: &quot;I made this record mostly alone in my small studio in Brooklyn. Played all the instruments and sang all the songs, engineered it as well. Except for when I recorded the drums (And then Merritt Jacob lent me his expertise and enthusiasm. Nothing gets done without enthusiasm so thanks, Merritt.)&quot;

===&quot;The Family&quot; (2016)===
For this release, Joseph Arthur acquired a Steinway Vertegrand piano from the early 1900s, moved it into his Red Hook, Brooklyn studio and saved it from the storm (Hurricane Sandy) by propping it up on cinderblocks, while the neighborhood flooded. He learned some of its history: the piano had been a part of the same family for a century, somewhere in Connecticut. Written entirely on that piano, The Family (Real World Records) is mostly a work of fiction and a meditation on the idea of family. The album was released June 3, 2016 to rave reviews.

===&quot;Arthur Buck&quot; (2018)===
In June 2018, Arthur released &quot;Arthur Buck&quot;, an album recorded with R.E.M.&#x27;s guitarist Peter Buck.

===&quot;Come Back World&quot; (2019)===
2019 saw Arthur release of full length solo album &quot;Come Back World&quot;, on his own label &quot;Moon Age Rebel&quot; - produced by Arthur and Chris Seefried. The album features backing vocals from Ben Harper, Jesse Malin, Marley Monroe, and Morgan James.

===&quot;Stop the Shot&quot;===
In 2021, Arthur released &quot;Stop the Shot&quot;, a song that includes the lyrics &quot;So take me uptown, baby / I don&#x27;t want to make a fuss / And keep your graphene oxide out of me / Baby, I don&#x27;t want to rust&quot;.

==Visual art==
Arthur has also received acclaim as a painter and designer. His artwork has appeared on the sleeves of his entire discography, notably the album covers for &quot;Come to Where I&#x27;m From&quot; and &quot;Our Shadows Will Remain&quot;, which included a 36-page booklet featuring prints of his original artwork, and was released with a die-cut outer slipcase sleeve. Arthur and frequent graphic design collaborator Zachary Larner&#x27;s sleeve design for the 1999 extended play &quot;Vacancy&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. He staged his first art exhibition in 2006 at the Vertigo Gallery in London from February 10 to 12, and released a 110-page book entitled &quot;We Almost Made It&quot;, a visual collection of his artworks, along with an accompanying instrumental CD titled &quot;The Invisible Parade&quot; in May 2006.

He set up his personal art gallery &quot;The Museum of Modern Arthur&quot; in June 2007 as a brick and mortar location in Brooklyn&#x27;s DUMBO District. According to an article on Stereogum.com, Joseph and the MOMAR were evicted from the building. Joseph held a record release party for &quot;Temporary People&quot; before the closing of the gallery in September 2008. The MOMAR gallery soon morphed into an online gallery.

==Live performances==
Arthur&#x27;s one man band live performances incorporate looping techniques and several distortion techniques. His live performances are recorded through to the last note and then burnt to CD-R. They are sold immediately to fans after the concert. Beginning with his fall 2006 tour, Arthur incorporated a full band, The Lonely Astronauts. They are no longer together.

The Lonely Astronauts:
* Joseph Arthur – vocals, guitar
* Kraig Jarret Johnson – guitar, keyboards, vocals
* Jennifer &quot;Jen&quot; Turner – guitar, vocals
* Sibyl Buck – bass, vocals
* Greg Wieczorek – drums, vocals

==Instruments and loops==
Of the guitars that Joseph utilizes, his primary acoustic guitar is an Irish Lowden 012C. Some of Joseph&#x27;s other guitars include a Garrison G-50-CE, a custom-painted Godin Kingpin CWII, a Gibson ES-335, and a 1970s Fender Strat. As of 2019, Joseph is pictured in video clips playing a custom painted Fender Acoustasonic.

To incorporate his looping techniques, Arthur uses various rack-mounted units of the Lexicon JamMan. He plays his guitars through an impressive bank of effects pedals. When performing solo live, he often records a sample of guitar, percussion, or vocals which he can then loop periodically throughout a song, allowing him to perform verses with the added effect of harmonizing with himself.

==Podcast: Come to Where I&#x27;m From==
In 2019 Joseph Arthur launched a podcast entitled, &quot;Come to Where I&#x27;m From&quot;, named after his 2000 release. The podcast was produced by Ehud Lazin who also appears on the podcast. The podcast was hosted by Joseph Arthur and was recorded in the East Village, New York City.

The show was a long-form interview/conversation format discussing the creative process, health and fitness, psychology, diet, current events, spirituality, poetry, rock n roll, and Art. Many of the topics were personal, where Arthur talks candidly about his experiences with Drugs, Alcohol Addiction, NPD and PTSD.

The final episode (#130) was posted in July 2021.

==Personal life==

Arthur identifies as Christian. He champions fitness, wellness, but also homeopathic remedies. He and his girlfriend, Anna Sophia, have one daughter, Alessia, who was born in July 2021.

Arthur first commented publicly on his beliefs related to COVID-19 in April 2020 and his opposition to the COVID-19 vaccine. His manager, booking agent, and record label severed their associations with Arthur in 2021. New West Records also declined to release an album he recorded with Peter Buck. Arthur released &quot;Stop the Shot&quot;, a song which repeats the lyric &quot;We will overcome/what those fools have done&quot; in August 2021.

<doc id="442633" wikidata="Q715515" url="?curid=442633" title="Charlie Rose">
<text>Charles Peete Rose Jr. (born January 5, 1942) is an American journalist and talk show host. From 1991 to 2017, he was the host and executive producer of the talk show &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; on PBS and Bloomberg LP. On the show, he interviewed thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and fellow newsmakers. The show was known for its distinguished stature and intellectual tone.

Rose also co-anchored &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; from 2012 to 2017 alongside Gayle King and Norah O&#x27;Donnell, where he interviewed many celebrities, institutional leaders, and political figures. Rose formerly substituted for the anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. In 2012, Rose, along with Lara Logan, hosted the revived CBS classic &quot;Person to Person&quot;, a news program during which celebrities are interviewed in their homes, originally hosted from 1953 to 1961 by Edward R. Murrow. Since 2022, Rose has hosted the online interviews &quot;Charlie Rose Conversations&quot;. Rose also occasionally appeared in films and television shows including &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; and &quot;House of Cards.&quot;

In November 2017, Rose was fired from PBS after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published multiple in-house allegations of sexual misconduct from the late 1990s to 2011. Rose responded to those allegations by admitting to having behaved insensitively at times but did not believe that all of the allegations were accurate, and later suggested women were exploiting the #MeToo campaign. His employment at CBS was also terminated, and his eponymous show was canceled. The allegations also led to Rose being stripped of several awards and honors. In November 2024, the sexual harassment lawsuit ended with a settlement in which the plaintiffs acknowledged there was no ill intent on the part of Rose for his conduct.

==Early life and education==
Rose was born in Henderson, North Carolina, the only child of Margaret (née Frazier) and Charles Peete Rose Sr., tobacco farmers who owned a country store. As a child, Rose lived above his parents&#x27; store in Henderson, and helped out with the family business from age seven. Rose said in a &quot;Fresh Dialogues&quot; interview that as a child, his insatiable curiosity was constantly getting him in trouble.

A high school basketball star at Henderson High School, in his hometown, Rose entered Duke University, intending to pursue a degree with a pre-med track; however, he became interested in politics during an internship at the office of Democratic North Carolina Senator B. Everett Jordan. He graduated in 1964 with a B.A. in history. At Duke, he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He earned a J.D. from the Duke University School of Law in 1968. He met his first wife, Mary (née King), while attending Duke.

==Career==

After his wife was hired by the BBC (in New York), Rose handled some assignments for the BBC on a freelance basis. In 1972, while working at New York bank Bankers Trust, he landed a job as a weekend reporter for WPIX-TV. Rose&#x27;s &quot;break&quot; came in 1974, after Bill Moyers hired him as managing editor for the PBS series &quot;Bill Moyers&#x27; International Report.&quot; In 1975, Moyers appointed him as executive producer of &quot;Bill Moyers Journal.&quot; Rose soon began appearing on camera. &quot;A Conversation with Jimmy Carter&quot;, which aired on Moyers&#x27;s TV series &quot;U.S.A.: People and Politics&quot;, won a 1976 Peabody Award. He then worked at several networks honing his interview skills, until NBC affiliate KXAS-TV in Dallas–Fort Worth hired him as program manager and provided the late-night time slot that became &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;.

===&quot;CBS News&quot;===
Rose worked for CBS News from 1984 to 1990 as the anchor of &quot;CBS News Nightwatch,&quot; the network&#x27;s first late-night news broadcast, which often featured him doing interviews with notable people in a format similar to that of his later PBS show. The &quot;Nightwatch&quot; broadcast of Rose&#x27;s interview with Charles Manson won a News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award in 1987. In 1990, Rose left CBS to serve as anchor of &quot;Personalities,&quot; a Fox TV-produced syndicated program, but six weeks into production and unhappy with the show&#x27;s soundbite-driven populist tabloid-journalism approach to stories, he left.

===&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;===

On September 30, 1991, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; premiered on PBS station Thirteen/WNET and was nationally fed on PBS beginning in January 1993. In 1994, Rose moved the show to a studio owned by Bloomberg LP, which allowed for high-definition video via satellite-remote interviews. On the show, he interviewed thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and fellow newsmakers. The show was known for its distinguished stature and intellectual tone. Barack Obama made 11 appearances on the show as a senator, presidential candidate, and as president. Other former presidents who appeared on the program include Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Donald Trump appeared on the program as a citizen but not as president.

Various filmmakers appeared on the show including Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Sydney Pollack, Quentin Tarantino, Brian de Palma, Oliver Stone, Roman Polanski, Tim Burton, Sidney Lumet, Terry Gilliam, David Lynch, Guillermo del Toro, Peter Jackson, Wes Anderson, Ron Howard, George Lucas, Peter Bogdanovich, Mike Nichols, Sofia Coppola, Spike Lee, and Noah Baumbach. Comedians also have appeared on the show including George Carlin, Louis C.K., Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Joan Rivers, Jon Stewart, Aziz Ansari, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Bill Maher, Ricky Gervais, John Oliver, and Key &amp; Peele. Rose also hosted a variety of film critics including Roger Ebert, Janet Maslin, Stanley Kauffmann, Richard Corliss, Richard Schickel, David Denby, Andrew Sarris, and A. O. Scott.

Guest hosts included A. O. Scott, Judd Apatow, Seth Meyers, Anthony Mason, Jon Meacham, Katie Couric, and Molly Haskell. The show ran a total of 26 years from 1991 to 2017.

===&quot;60 Minutes&quot;===
Rose was a correspondent for &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; from its inception in January 1999 until its cancellation in September 2005, and was named a correspondent on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2008. When asked what makes a good interviewee Rose responded, &quot;[it] is somebody who wants to engage and who views it as an opportunity to express their ideas, to have their ideas tested, to listen to the questions and to be as responsive to the questions as they can. Someone who is spontaneous, authentic, engaged, and passionate. That&#x27;s the kind of person that&#x27;ll give you a good interview.&quot;

For &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Rose has interviewed such people as Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Apple Inc. business executive Tim Cook, political strategist Steve Bannon, comedian Larry David, stage actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, and actor Sean Penn.

He was a member of the board of directors of Citadel Broadcasting Corporation from 2003 to 2009. In May 2010, he delivered the commencement address at North Carolina State University.

===&quot;CBS This Morning&quot;===
On November 15, 2011, it was announced that Rose would return to CBS to help anchor &quot;CBS This Morning,&quot; replacing &quot;The Early Show,&quot; commencing January 9, 2012, along with co-anchors Gayle King and Erica Hill. In July 2012, Norah O&#x27;Donnell replaced Hill on the program. The show received high ratings due to their chemistry.

Rose interviewed many celebrities, institutional leaders, and political figures, including Donald Trump (1992); Bill Gates (1996); Steve Jobs (1996); Sean Penn (2008 &amp; 2016); Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (2013), for which he won a second Peabody Award; U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle (2012); U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett; David Rockefeller; MIT Linguistics professor Noam Chomsky (2003); actor/producer Leonardo DiCaprio (2004); comedians Louis C.K. and George Carlin; actor Christoph Waltz; director Quentin Tarantino; actor Bradley Cooper; Larry Ellison, the co-founder and then CEO of Oracle Corporation; former Iranian empress Farah Pahlavi; Vladimir Putin (2015); and tennis champion Maria Sharapova.

===&quot;Charlie Rose Conversations&quot;===
On April 14, 2022, Rose released an interview with billionaire Warren Buffett, in his first public appearance since 2017 when multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. The interview was uploaded to his own personal website and it is listed as the first in a series called &quot;Charlie Rose Conversations&quot;. Subsequent episodes have included interviews with Thomas Friedman, Ray Dalio, Fatima Gailani, Isabella Rossellini, David Petraeus, and others.

=== Other television appearances ===
In &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, he appears as a cameo in an interview with Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz on the TV at the end of &quot;Granite State&quot;, which is watched by Walter White. In August 2013, the summer before the airing of the fifth and final season, Rose interviewed series creator Vince Gilligan and actors Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn and Aaron Paul for an episode of his show. Following the conclusion of the series, he also appeared on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; along with Gilligan.

==Filmography==
===Film===
===Television===
Rose and his show were parodied in the Wes Anderson film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001) and in the first episode of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; in 2014.

==Influence==
In 2009, Rose encouraged a discussion between the leaders of NBC and Fox News that eventually led to a mutual reduction in &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks between Keith Olbermann and Bill O&#x27;Reilly on their respective news programs.

==Awards and honors==

Rose was awarded the 2014 Vincent Scully Prize by the National Building Museum. The prize is awarded for &quot;exemplary practice, scholarship or criticism in architecture, historic preservation and urban design&quot; according to the Museum. The award to Rose was stated as being due to his having &quot;interviewed leaders of architecture and design and led &#x27;insightful and substantive conversations&#x27; about the growth of cities and urban development.&quot; Amanda Burden, a former director of the New York City Department of City Planning, who was in a relationship with him from 1993 to 2006, spoke at the award ceremony in November 2014. Rose received an honorary doctorate from the State University of New York at Oswego on October 16, 2014, during the college&#x27;s annual Lewis B. O&#x27;Donnell Media Summit, for his contributions in the broadcast, media, and television industries. In 2016, Duke University awarded him an honorary degree.

The sexual misconduct allegations against Rose in 2017 led to him being stripped of his several awards and honors, as had happened to Bill Cosby amid his own sexual misconduct cases. On May 8, 2016, he received an honorary degree from . There were, however, calls for Sewanee officials to strip Rose of the degree, and, as of March 21, 2018, all honors from Sewanee have been rescinded. The State University of New York at Oswego Board of Trustees voted to revoke Rose&#x27;s honorary degree on January 23, 2018.

On November 21, 2017, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre rescinded a planned award to Rose. The Diocese was set to honor him as a &quot;leader in broadcast media&quot;. Three days later, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism given to him in 2015 was rescinded by the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. On the same day, officials at University of Kansas&#x27;s School of Journalism and Mass Communications rescinded the National Citation Award it gave to Rose in 2017.

On December 4, 2017, officials at Duke University&#x27;s DeWitt Wallace Center for Media &amp; Democracy rescinded the Futrell Award it gave him in September 2000. The award is given to outstanding Duke graduates who work in journalism. Montclair State University officials were considering whether to revoke the honorary doctorate it gave to him in 2002. The National Building Museum has made no public announcement on whether the 2014 Vincent Scully Prize has been withdrawn from Rose, but his name no longer appears on the list of winners on the organisation&#x27;s website.

Officials at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&#x27;s Hussman School of Journalism and Media considered the fate of Rose&#x27;s 1999 induction into the N.C. Journalism Hall of Fame. School officials ultimately decided to keep him in the Hall of Fame, while amending his Hall of Fame biography to include details of the sexual misconduct allegations.

==Personal life==

Rose was married to Mary Rose (née King) from 1968 until their divorce in 1980. In 1992, he began dating socialite and former New York City Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden, a stepdaughter of CBS founder William S. Paley. In 2011, he told a &quot;Financial Times&quot; reporter that he and Burden had stopped dating in about 2006.

On March 29, 2006, after experiencing shortness of breath in Syria, he was flown to Paris and underwent surgery for mitral valve repair in the Georges-Pompidou European Hospital. His surgery was performed under the supervision of Alain Carpentier, a pioneer of the procedure. Rose returned to the air on June 12, 2006, with Bill Moyers and Yvette Vega (the show&#x27;s executive producer), to discuss his surgery and recuperation. In February 2017, he announced he would undergo another surgery to replace the same valve.

Rose owns a large house in Henderson, North Carolina, a 5,500-square-foot (465-square-meter) beach home in Bellport, New York, and an apartment in The Sherry-Netherland of New York City, each worth several million dollars. Rose also owns apartments in Washington, D.C., and Paris. In 1990, he purchased a 525-acre (212-ha) soybean farm near Oxford, North Carolina, for use as a country retreat. He named the property Grassy Creek Farm.

Rose is a member of the Deepdale Golf Club on Long Island and the Council on Foreign Relations.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations ===
On November 20, 2017, eight women who were employees of, or aspired to work for, Rose accused him of various acts of sexual misconduct including harassment, groping, and making lewd phone calls. Those accusations, which started amid the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases and Kevin Spacey sexual misconduct allegations and made in a report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, dealt with conduct from the late 1990s to 2011. On the day the article on the women&#x27;s statements was published, PBS and Bloomberg LP suspended distribution of his show, and CBS announced that it was suspending the broadcaster pending an investigation. CBS, PBS, and Bloomberg terminated their contracts with him the following day. Rose issued a statement: 

In May 2018, 27 more women accused him of sexual harassment, including groping and suggestive comments. This brought the total number of women who have accused him of abusive behavior and sexual harassment to 35. Rose was sued for verbal harassment by Gina Riggi, his former makeup artist of 20 years. On August 31, 2018, he filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on its standing, suggesting women were exploiting the #MeToo campaign.

Rose&#x27;s firing as a co-anchor on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; was covered by CBS, the day after the report was published. His former co-hosts Gayle King and Norah O&#x27;Donnell confronted the matter live on air. King stated that she was still &quot;reeling&quot; and &quot;really struggling&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell stated &quot;there is no excuse for this alleged behavior&quot; and both agreed he &quot;does not get a pass here&quot; for his behavior.

John Dickerson, former host of &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, replaced Rose as a co-anchor on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, and Christiane Amanpour took over for his roles on PBS. In 2018, an exposé published by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described his life after being fired as one that is &quot;lonely&quot;. In 2019, Gayle King stated that she keeps in contact and is still friends with him: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what his second act is, but Charlie is a very smart guy. There must be room for redemption.&quot;

On 26 November 2024, the sexual harassment lawsuit brought forward by three former &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; employees ended with a settlement. In settling the lawsuit, the plaintiffs acknowledged there was &quot;no ill intent&quot; on the part of Rose for his conduct.

<text>Gioseffo Zarlino (31 January or 22 March 1517 – 4 February 1590) was an Italian music theorist and composer of the Renaissance. He made a large contribution to the theory of counterpoint as well as to musical tuning.

==Life and career==
Zarlino was born in Chioggia, near Venice. His early education was with the Franciscans, and he later joined the order himself. In 1536 he was a singer at Chioggia Cathedral, and by 1539 he not only became a deacon, but also principal organist. In 1540 he was ordained, and in 1541 went to Venice to study with the famous contrapuntist and &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of Saint Mark&#x27;s, Adrian Willaert.

In 1565, on the resignation of Cipriano de Rore, Zarlino took over the post of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of St. Mark&#x27;s, one of the most prestigious musical positions in Italy, and held it until his death. While &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; he taught some of the principal figures of the Venetian school of composers, including Claudio Merulo, Girolamo Diruta, and Giovanni Croce, as well as Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the astronomer, and the famous reactionary polemicist Giovanni Artusi.

==Works and influence==

While he was a moderately prolific composer, and his motets are polished and display a mastery of canonic counterpoint, his principal claim to fame was his work as a theorist. While Pietro Aaron may have been the first theorist to describe a version of meantone, Zarlino seems to have been the first to do so with exactitude, describing 2/7-comma meantone in his &quot;Le istitutioni harmoniche&quot; in 1558. Zarlino also described the 1/4-comma meantone and 1/3-comma meantone, considering all three temperaments to be usable. In more recent times, these have been approximated by the 50- 31- and 19-tone equal temperaments, respectively. In his &quot;Dimostrationi harmoniche&quot; of 1571, he revised the numbering of modes to make the finales of the mode conform to the notes of the natural hexachord. He also wrote a treatise by the name of &quot;Sopplimenti Musicali&quot;, published in 1588, dedicated to Pope Sixtus V . 

Zarlino was the first to theorize the primacy of triad over interval as a means of structuring harmony. His exposition of just intonation based on proportions within the &quot;Senario&quot; (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 8 is a departure from the previously established Pythagorean diatonic system as passed on by Boethius. See: Ptolemy&#x27;s intense diatonic scale. He was also one of the first theorists to offer an explanation for the prohibition of parallel fifths and octaves in counterpoint, and to study the effect and harmonic implications of the false relation.

Zarlino&#x27;s writings, primarily published by Francesco Franceschi, spread throughout Europe at the end of the 16th century. Translations and annotated versions were common in France, Germany, as well as in the Netherlands among students of Sweelinck, thus influencing the next generation of musicians who represented the early Baroque style.

Zarlino&#x27;s compositions are more conservative in idiom than those of many of his contemporaries. His madrigals avoid the homophonic textures commonly used by other composers, remaining polyphonic throughout, in the manner of his motets. His works were published between 1549 and 1567, and include 41 motets, mostly for five and six voices, and 13 secular works, mostly madrigals, for four and five voices. His 10 motets on the Song of Songs used the text of Isidoro Chiari&#x27;s translation of the Bible.

<doc id="442637" wikidata="Q2379654" url="?curid=442637" title="Henrietta Street, Dublin">
<text>Henrietta Street () is a Dublin street, to the north of Bolton Street on the north side of the city, first laid out and developed by Luke Gardiner during the 1720s. A very wide street relative to streets in other 18th-century cities, it includes a number of very large red-brick city palaces of Georgian design.

==Name==

The street is generally held to be named after Henrietta (née Somerset; 1690–1726), the wife of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, although an alternative candidate is Henrietta (née Crofts; 1697–1730), third wife of Charles Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton. The nearby Bolton Street is named after Paulet.

==History==
Henrietta Street is the earliest Georgian Street in Dublin, and at the forefront of Dublin&#x27;s later Georgian streetscapes. Construction on the street started in the mid-1720s, on land bought by the Gardiner family in 1721. Construction was still taking place in the 1750s. Gardiner had a mansion, designed by Richard Cassels, built for his own use around 1730.

The street was popularly referred to as &quot;Primate&#x27;s Hill&quot;, as one of the houses was owned by the Archbishop of Armagh, although this house, along with two others, was demolished to make way for the Law Library of King&#x27;s Inns.

The street fell into disrepair during the 19th and 20th centuries, with the houses being used as tenements. While the houses on Henrietta Street had been home to a small number of wealthy residents in the 18th century, these were given-over to tenement use during the 19th century, and by 1911 there were 835 people living in poverty in just 15 houses. A number of houses on the street remained in use as tenements until the 1970s. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the street has been subject to restoration efforts.

The street has been used as a period-location for film and TV companies, with productions filmed including &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot;, &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot; and &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;.

The street is a cul-de-sac, with the Law Library of King&#x27;s Inns facing onto its western end. As of 2017, there are 13 houses on the street. One of these houses, 14 Henrietta Street, was opened as a museum in late 2018. &quot;14 Henrietta Street&quot; tells the story of the building and of the lives of the people who lived there. A plaque at the address commemorates its association with Irish republican Thomas Bryan.

==First residents==
The street was initially popular with landed and merchant families, and a number of hereditary peers had properties on the street in the mid-18th century. The houses were built to have rear gardens and mews.

<text>Homo heidelbergensis (also H. erectus heidelbergensis, H. sapiens heidelbergensis) is an extinct species or subspecies of archaic human which existed from around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, during the Middle Pleistocene. &quot; Homo heidelbergensis&quot; was widely considered the most recent common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals, but this view has been increasingly disputed since the late 2010s. 

In the Middle Pleistocene, brain size and height were comparable to modern humans. Like Neanderthals, &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; had a wide chest and robust frame. 

Fire likely became an integral part of daily life after 400,000 years ago, and this roughly coincides with more permanent and widespread occupation of Europe (above 45°N), and the appearance of hafting technology to create spears. &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; may have been able to carry out coordinated hunting strategies, and consequently they seem to have had a higher consumption of meat.

It is debated whether or not to constrain &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; to only Europe or to also include African and Asian specimens, and this is further confounded by the type specimen (Mauer 1) being a jawbone, because jawbones feature few diagnostic traits and are generally missing among Middle Pleistocene specimens.

&quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; was subsumed in 1950 as a subspecies of &quot;H. erectus&quot; but today it is more widely classified as its own species. &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; is regarded as a chronospecies, evolving from an African form of &quot;H. erectus&quot; (sometimes called &quot;H. ergaster&quot;).

== Taxonomy ==
=== Research history ===

The first fossil, Mauer 1 (a jawbone), was discovered by a worker in Mauer, southeast of Heidelberg, Germany, in 1907. It was formally described the next year by German anthropologist Otto Schoetensack, who made it the type specimen of a new species, &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;. He split this off as a new species primarily because of the mandible&#x27;s archaicness—in particular its enormous size—and it was the then-oldest human jaw in the European fossil record at 640,000 years old. The mandible is well preserved, missing only the left premolars, part of the first left molar, the tip of the left coronoid process (at the jaw hinge), and fragments of the mid-section: the jaw was found in two pieces and had to be glued together. It may have belonged to a young adult based on slight wearing on the 3rd molar. 

In 1921, the skull Kabwe 1 was discovered by Swiss miner Tom Zwiglaar in Kabwe, Zambia (at the time Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia); it was assigned to a new species, &quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot;, by English palaeontologist Arthur Smith Woodward.

&quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot; and &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; were two of the many putative species of Middle Pleistocene &quot;Homo&quot; which were described throughout the first half of the 20th century. In the 1950s, Ernst Mayr entered the field of anthropology and, surveying a &quot;bewildering diversity of names&quot;, decided to define only three species of &quot;Homo&quot;: &quot;H. transvaalensis&quot; (the australopithecines), &quot;H. erectus&quot; (including the Mauer mandible, and various putative African and Asian taxa) and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (including anything younger than &quot;H. erectus&quot;, such as modern humans and Neanderthals). Mayr defined them as a sequential lineage, with each species evolving into the next (chronospecies). Though later Mayr changed his opinion on the australopithecines (recognizing &quot;Australopithecus&quot;), his view of archaic human diversity became widely adopted in the subsequent decades.

Though &quot;H. erectus&quot; is still maintained as a highly variable, widespread, and long-lasting species, it is still much debated whether or not sinking all Middle Pleistocene remains into it is justifiable. Mayr&#x27;s lumping of &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; into &quot;H. erectus&quot; was first opposed by American anthropologist Francis Clark Howell in 1960. 

In 1974, British physical anthropologist Chris Stringer pointed out similarities between the Kabwe 1 and the Greek Petralona skulls to the skulls of modern humans (&quot;H. sapiens&quot; or &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;) and Neanderthals (&quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; or &quot;H. s. neanderthalensis&quot;). So, Stringer assigned them to &quot;Homo sapiens sensu lato&quot; (&quot;in the broad sense&quot;), as ancestral to modern humans and Neanderthals. In 1979, Stringer and Finnish anthropologist Björn Kurtén found that the Kabwe and Petralona skulls are associated with the Cromerian industry like the Mauer mandible, and thus postulated these three populations might be allied with each other. Though these fossils are poorly preserved and do not provide many comparable possible diagnostic traits (and likewise it was difficult at the time to properly define a unique species), they argued that at least these Middle Pleistocene specimens should be allocated to &quot;H. (s.?) heidelbergensis&quot; or &quot;H. (s.?) rhodesiensis&quot; (depending on, respectively, the inclusion or exclusion of the Mauer mandible) to formally recognize their similarity.

Further work, most influentially by Stringer, palaeoanthropologist Ian Tattersall, and human evolutionary biologist Phillip Rightmire reported further differences between Middle Pleistocene Afro-European specimens and &quot;H. erectus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;in the strict sense&quot;, in this case, specimens from East Asia). Consequently, Afro-European remains from 600 to 300 thousand years ago—most notably from Kabwe, Petralona, Bodo and Arago—are often classified as &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;. In 2010, American physical anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz and Tattersall suggested classifying all Middle Pleistocene European as well as Asian specimens—namely from Dali and Jinniushan in China—as &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;. This model is not as universally accepted. After the 2010 identification of the genetic code of some unique archaic human species in Siberia, termed &quot;Denisovans&quot; pending diagnostic fossil finds, it is postulated that the Asian remains could represent that same species. Thus, Middle Pleistocene Asian specimens, such as Dali Man or the Indian Narmada Man, remain enigmatic. The paleontology institute at Heidelberg University, where the Mauer mandible has been kept since 1908, changed the label from &quot;H. e. heidelbergensis&quot; to &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; in 2015.
In 1976 at Sima de los Huesos (SH) in the Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain, Spanish paleontologists Emiliano Aguirre, José María Basabe and Trinidad Torres began to excavate archaic human remains. Their investigation of the site was prompted by the finding of several bear remains (&quot;Ursus deningeri&quot;) since the early 20th century by amateur cavers (which consequently destroyed some of the human remains in that section). By 1990, about 600 human remains were reported, and by 2004 the number had increased to roughly 4,000. These represent at least 28 individuals, of which possibly only one is a child, and the rest teenagers and young adults. The fossil assemblage is exceptionally complete, with whole corpses buried rapidly, and all bodily elements represented. In 1997, Spanish palaeoanthropologist Juan Luis Arsuaga assigned these to &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, but in 2014, he retracted this, stating that Neanderthal-like features present in the Mauer mandible are missing in the SH humans.

=== Classification ===
In palaeoanthropology, the Middle Pleistocene is often termed the &quot;muddle in the middle&quot; because the species-level classification of archaic human remains from this time period has been heavily debated. The ancestors of modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot; or &quot;H. s. sapiens&quot;) and Neanderthals (&quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; or &quot;H. s. neanderthalensis&quot;) diverged during this time period, and until the late 2010s &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; was considered the most likely last common ancestor (LCA), but this view is no longer generally accepted. It is much debated if the name &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; can be extended to Middle Pleistocene humans across the Old World, or if it is better to restrict it to just Europe. In the latter case, Middle Pleistocene African remains can be split off into &quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot;. In the latter view, &quot;&quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot; can either be seen as the direct ancestor of modern humans, or of &quot;H. helmei&quot; which evolved into modern humans.

I
In 2021, Canadian anthropologist Mirjana Roksandic and colleagues recommended the complete dissolution of &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; and &quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot;, as the name &quot;rhodesiensis&quot; honours English diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes who disenfranchised the black population in southern Africa. They classified all European &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; as &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot;, and synonymised &quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot; with a new species they named &quot;H. bodoensis&quot; which includes all African specimens, and potentially some from the Levant and the Balkans which have no Neanderthal-derived traits (namely Ceprano, Mala Balanica, HaZore&#x27;a and Nadaouiyeh Aïn Askar). &quot;H. bodoensis&quot; is supposed to represent the immediate ancestor of modern humans, but does not include the LCA of modern humans and Neanderthals. They suggested the confusing morphology of the Middle Pleistocene was caused by periodic &quot;H. bodoensis&quot; migration events into Europe following population collapses after glacial cycles, interbreeding with surviving indigenous populations. Their taxonomic recommendations were rejected by Stringer and others as they failed to explain how exactly their proposals would resolve anything, in addition to violating nomenclatural rules.

=== Evolution ===
&quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; is thought to have descended from African &quot;H. erectus&quot; — sometimes classified as &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; — during the first early expansions of hominins out of Africa beginning roughly 2 million years ago. Those that dispersed across Europe and stayed in Africa evolved into &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; or speciated into &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; in Europe and &quot;H. rhodesiensis&quot;&quot; in Africa, and those that dispersed across East Asia evolved into &quot;H. erectus s. s.&quot; The exact derivation from an ancestor species is obfuscated by a long gap in the human fossil record near the end of the Early Pleistocene. In 2016, Antonio Profico and colleagues suggested that 875,000-year-old skull materials from the Gombore II site of the Melka Kunture Formation, Ethiopia, represent a transitional morph between &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, and thus postulated that &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; originated in Africa instead of Europe.
According to genetic analysis, the LCA of modern humans and Neanderthal split into a modern human line, and a Neanderthal/Denisovan line, and the latter later split into Neanderthal and Denisovans. According to nuclear DNA analysis, the 430,000-year-old SH humans are more closely related to Neanderthals than Denisovans (and that the Neanderthal/Denisovan, and thus the modern human/Neanderthal split, had already occurred), suggesting the modern human/Neanderthal LCA had existed long before many European specimens typically assigned to &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; did, such as the Arago and Petralona materials.

In 1997, Spanish archaeologist José María Bermúdez de Castro, Arsuaga, and colleagues described the roughly million-year-old &quot;H. antecessor&quot; from Gran Dolina, Sierra de Atapuerca, and suggested supplanting this species in the place of &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; for the LCA between modern humans and Neanderthals, with &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; descending from it and being a strictly European species ancestral to only Neanderthals. They later recanted. In 2020, Dutch molecular palaeoanthropologist Frido Welker and colleagues analysed ancient proteins collected from an &quot;H. antecessor&quot; tooth found that it was a member of a sister lineage to the LCA rather than being the LCA itself (that is, &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; did not derive from &quot;H. antecessor&quot;).

Human dispersal beyond 45°N seems to have been quite limited during the Lower Palaeolithic, with evidence of short-lived dispersals northward beginning after a million years ago. Beginning 700,000 years ago, more permanent populations seem to have persisted across the line coinciding with the spread of hand axe technology across Europe, possibly associated with the dispersal of &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; and behavioural shifts to cope with the cold climate. Such occupation becomes much more frequent after 500,000 years ago.

In 2023, a genomics analysis of over 3,000 living individuals indicated that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;&#x27; ancestral population was reduced to less than 1,300 individuals between 800,000 and 900,000 years ago. Prof Giorgio Manzi, an anthropologist at Sapienza University of Rome, suggested that this bottleneck could have triggered the evolution of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;.

== Anatomy ==
=== Skull ===

In comparison to Early Pleistocene &quot;H. erectus&quot;/&quot;ergaster&quot;, Middle Pleistocene humans have a much more modern human-like face. The nasal opening is set completely vertically in the skull, and the anterior nasal sill can be crested or sometimes a prominent spine. The incisive canals (on the roof of the mouth) open near the teeth, and are orientated like those of more recent human species. The frontal bone is broad, the parietal bone can be expanded, and the squamous part of temporal bone is high and arched, which could all be related to increasing brain size. The sphenoid bone features a spine extending downwards, and the articular tubercle on the underside of the skull can jut out prominently as the surface behind the jaw hinge is otherwise quite flat.

In 2004, Rightmire estimated the brain volumes of ten Middle Pleistocene humans variously attributable to &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;—from Kabwe, Bodo, Ndutu, Dali, Jinniushan, Petralona, Steinheim, Arago, and two from SH. This set gives an average volume of about 1,206 cc, ranging from 1,100 to 1,390 cc. He also averaged the brain volumes of 30 &quot;H. erectus&quot;/&quot;ergaster&quot; specimens, spanning nearly 1.5 million years from across East Asia and Africa, as 973 cc, and thus concluded a significant jump in brain size, though conceded brain size was extremely variable ranging from 727 to 1,231 cc depending on the time period, geographic region, and even between individuals within the same population (the last one probably due to notable sexual dimorphism with males much bigger than females). In comparison, for modern humans, brain size averages 1,270 cc for males and 1,130 cc for females; and for Neanderthals 1,600 cc for males and 1,300 cc for females.
In 2009, palaeontologists Aurélien Mounier, François Marchal and Silvana Condemi published the first differential diagnosis of &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; using the Mauer mandible, as well as material from Tighennif, Algeria; SH, Spain; Arago, France; and Montmaurin, France. They listed the diagnostic traits as: a reduced chin, a notch in the submental space (near the throat), parallel upper and lower boundaries of the mandible in side-view, several mental foramina (small holes for blood vessels) near the cheek teeth, a horizontal retromolar space (a gap behind the molars), a gutter between the molars and the ramus (which juts up to connect with the skull), an overall long jaw, a deep fossa (a depression) for the masseter muscle (which closes the jaw), a small gonial angle (the angle between the body of the mandible and the ramus), an extensive planum alveolare (the distance from the frontmost tooth socket to the back of the jaw), a developed planum triangulare (near the jaw hinge), and a mylohyoid line originating at the level of the third molar.

===Size===
Trends in body size through the Middle Pleistocene are obscured due to a general lack of limb bones and non-skull (post-cranial) remains. Based on the lengths of various long bones, the SH humans averaged roughly for males and for females, with maximums of respectively and . The height of a female partial skeleton from Jinniushan is estimated to have been quite tall at roughly in life, much taller than the SH females. A tibia from Kabwe is typically estimated to have been , among the tallest Middle Pleistocene specimens, but it is possible this individual was either unusually large or had a much longer tibia to femur ratio than expected.

If these specimens are representative of their respective continents, they would suggest that above-medium to tall people were prevalent throughout the Middle Pleistocene Old World. If this is the case, then most all populations of any archaic human species would have generally averaged to in height. Early modern humans were notably taller, with the Skhul and Qafzeh remains averaging for males and for females, an average of , possibly to increase the energy-efficiency of long-distance travel with longer legs.

A conspicuously massive proximal (upper half) femur was recovered from Berg Aukas Mine, Namibia, about east of Grootfontein. It was originally estimated to have been from a male as much as in life, but its exorbitant size is now proposed to be the consequence of an extraordinarily vigorous early-life activity level while an otherwise ordinary person was maturing. If so, the individual from the Berg Aukas Mine would probably have had proportions similar to Kabwe 1.

=== Build ===

The human body plan had evolved in &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, and characterises all later &quot;Homo&quot; species, but among the more derived members there are two distinct morphs: A narrow-chested and gracile build like modern humans, and a broader-chested and robust build like Neanderthals. It was once assumed that the Neanderthal build was unique to Neanderthals based on the gracile &quot;H. ergaster&quot; partial skeleton &quot;KNM WT-15000&quot; (&quot;Turkana Boy&quot;), but the discovery of some Middle Pleistocene skeletal elements (though generally fragmentary and few and far between) seems to suggest Middle Pleistocene humans overall featured a more Neanderthal morph. Thus, the modern human morph may be unique to modern humans, evolving quite recently. This is most clearly demonstrated in the exceptionally well-preserved SH assemblage. Based on skull robustness, it was assumed Middle Pleistocene humans featured a high degree of sexual dimorphism, but the SH humans demonstrate a modern humanlike level.

The SH humans and other Middle Pleistocene &quot;Homo&quot; have a more basal pelvis and femur (more similar to earlier &quot;Homo&quot; than Neanderthals). The overall broad and elliptical pelvis is broader, taller and thicker (expanded anteroposteriorly) than those of Neanderthals or modern humans, and retains an anteriorly located acetabulocristal buttress (which supports the iliac crests during hip abduction), a well defined supraacetabular groove (between the hip socket and the ilium), and a thin and rectangular superior pubic ramus (as opposed to the thick, stout one in modern humans). The foot of all archaic humans has a taller trochlea of the ankle bone, making the ankle more flexible (specifically dorsiflexion and plantarflexion).

=== Pathology ===
On the left side of its face, an SH skull (Skull 5) presents the oldest-known case of orbital cellulitis (eye infection which developed from an abscess in the mouth). This probably caused sepsis, killing the individual.

A male SH pelvis (Pelvis 1), based on joint degeneration, may have lived for more than 45 years, making him one of the oldest examples of this demographic in the human fossil record. The frequency of 45-plus individuals gradually increases with time, but has overall remained quite low throughout the Palaeolithic. He similarly had the age-related maladies lumbar kyphosis (excessive curving of the lumbar vertebrae of the lower back), L5–S1 spondylolisthesis (misalignment of the last lumbar vertebra with the first sacral vertebra), and Baastrup disease on L4 and 5 (enlargement of the spinous processes). These would have produced lower back pain, significantly limiting movement, and may be evidence of group care.

An adolescent SH skull (Cranium 14) was diagnosed with lambdoid single suture craniosynostosis (immature closing of the left lambdoid suture, leading to skull deformities as development continued). This is a rare condition, occurring in less than 6 out of every 200,000 individuals in modern humans. The individual died around the age of 10, suggesting it was not abandoned due its deformity as has been done in historical times, and received the same quality of care as any other child.

Enamel hypoplasia on the teeth is used to determine bouts of nutritional stress. At a rate of 40% for the SH humans, this is significantly higher than exhibited in the earlier South African hominin &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; at Swartkrans (30.6%) or Sterkfontein (12.1%). Nonetheless, Neanderthals suffered even higher rates and more intense bouts of hypoplasia, but it is unclear if this is because Neanderthals were less capable of exploiting natural resources, or because they lived in harsher environments. A peak at 3½ years of age may be correlated with weaning age. In Neanderthals this peak was at 4 years, and many modern hunter gatherers also wean at about 4 years of age.

==Culture==
===Food===
Middle Pleistocene communities in general seem to have eaten big game at a higher frequency than predecessors, with meat becoming an essential dietary component. In Europe, &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; is known to have consumed the largest megafauna species present in the region, the straight-tusked elephant (which has been found at numerous sites with cut marks and/or stone tools indicating butchery) and rhinoceroses belonging to the genus &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;. At the Schöningen spear horizon in Germany, there is extensive evidence for the butchery of horses. At the Boxgrove site in England, there is evidence for the butchery of roe deer, horse and rhinoceros. The inhabitants of Terra Amata in France seem to have been mainly eating deer, but also elephants, boar, ibex, rhino and aurochs. African sites commonly yield bovine and horse bones. Though carcasses may have simply been scavenged, some Afro-European sites show specific targeting of a single species, which more likely indicates active hunting; for example: Olorgesailie, Kenya, which has yielded over 50 to 60 individual baboons (&quot;Theropithecus oswaldi&quot;); and Torralba and Ambrona in Spain which have an abundance of elephant bones (though also rhino and large hoofed mammals). The increase in meat subsistence could indicate the development of group hunting strategies in the Middle Pleistocene. For instance, at Torralba and Ambrona, the animals may have been run into swamplands before being killed, entailing encircling and driving by a large group of hunters in a coordinated and organised attack. Exploitation of aquatic environments is generally quite lacking, despite some sites being in close proximity to the ocean, lakes or rivers.

Plants were probably also frequently consumed, including seasonally available ones; however, the extent of their exploitation is unclear as they do not fossilise as well as animal bones. At the Schöningen site in Germany, it is estimated that over 200 plant species in the vicinity were either edible raw or when cooked, though relatively few have actually been found at the site itself.

===Art===
Upper Palaeolithic modern humans are well known for having etched engravings seemingly with symbolic value. As of 2018, only 27 Middle and Lower Palaeolithic objects have been postulated to have symbolic etching, out of which some have been refuted as having been caused by natural or otherwise non-symbolic phenomena (such as the fossilisation or excavation processes). The Lower Palaeolithic ones are: a 400,000 to 350,000 years old bone from Bilzingsleben, Germany; three 380,000-year-old pebbles from Terra Amata; a 250,000-year-old pebble from Markkleeberg, Germany; 18 roughly 200,000-year-old pebbles from Lazaret (near Terra Amata); a roughly 200,000-year-old lithic from Grotte de l&#x27;Observatoire, Monaco and a 200- to 130-thousand-year-old pebble from Baume Bonne, France.

In the mid-19th century, French archaeologist Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes began excavation at St. Acheul, Amiens, France, (the area where the Acheulian was defined), and, in addition to hand axes, reported perforated sponge fossils (&quot;Porosphaera globularis&quot;) which he considered to have been decorative beads. This claim was completely ignored. In 1894, English archaeologist Worthington George Smith discovered 200 similar perforated fossils in Bedfordshire, England, and also speculated that their function was beads, though he made no reference to Boucher de Perthes&#x27; find, possibly because he was unaware of it. In 2005, Robert Bednarik reexamined the material, and concluded that—because all the Bedfordshire &quot;P. globularis&quot; fossils are sub-spherical and range in diameter, despite this species having a highly variable shape—they were deliberately chosen. They appear to have been bored through completely or almost completely by some parasitic creature (i. e., through natural processes), and were then percussed on what would have been the more closed-off end to fully open the hole. He also found wear facets which he speculated were begotten from clacking against other beads when they were strung together and worn as a necklace. In 2009, Solange Rigaud, Francisco d&#x27;Errico and colleagues noticed that the modified areas are lighter in colour than the unmodifed, suggesting they were inflicted much more recently such as during excavation. They were also unconvinced that the fossils could be confidently associated with the Acheulian artefacts from the sites, and suggested that—as an alternative to archaic human activity—apparent size-selection could have been caused by either natural geological processes or 19th-century collectors favouring this specific form.

Early modern humans and late Neanderthals (the latter especially after 60,000 years ago) made wide use of red ochre for presumably symbolic purposes as it produces a blood-like colour, though ochre can also have a functional medicinal application. Beyond these two species, ochre usage is recorded at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, where two red ochre lumps have been found; Ambrona where an ochre slab was trimmed down into a specific shape; and Terra Amata where 75 ochre pieces were heated to achieve a wide colour range from yellow to red-brown to red. These may exemplify early and isolated instances of colour preference and colour categorisation, and such practices may not have been normalised yet.
In 2006, Eudald Carbonell and Marina Mosquera suggested the Sima de los Huesos (SH) hominins were buried by people rather than being the victims of some catastrophic event such as a cave-in, because young children and infants are absent which would be unexpected if this were a single and complete family unit. The SH humans are conspicuously associated with only a single stone tool, a carefully crafted hand axe made of high-quality quartzite (rarely used in the region), and so Carbonell and Mosquera postulated this was purposefully and symbolically placed with the bodies as some kind of grave good. Supposed evidence of symbolic graves would not surface for another 300,000 years.

=== Technology ===
==== Stone tools ====
The Lower Palaeolithic (Early Stone Age) comprises the Oldowan which was replaced by the Acheulian, which is characterised by the production of mostly symmetrical hand axes. The Acheulian has a timespan of about a million years, and such technological stagnation has typically been ascribed to comparatively limited cognitive abilities which significantly reduced innovative capacity, such as a deficit in cognitive fluidity, working memory, or a social system compatible with apprenticeship. Nonetheless, the Acheulian does seem to subtly change over time, and is typically split up into Early Acheulian and Late Acheulian, the latter becoming especially popular after 600 to 500 thousand years ago. Late Acheulian technology never crossed over east of the Movius Line into East Asia, which is generally believed to be due to either some major deficit in cultural transmission (namely smaller population size in the East) or simply preservation bias as far fewer stone tool assemblages are found east of the line.
The transition is indicated by the production of smaller, thinner, and more symmetrical hand axes (though thicker, less refined ones were still produced). At the 500,000-year-old Boxgrove site in England—an exceptionally well-preserved site with abundance of tool remains—thinning may have been produced by striking the hand axe near-perpendicularly with a soft hammer, possible with the invention of prepared platforms for tool making. The Boxgrove knappers also left behind large lithic flakes leftover from making hand axes, possibly with the intention of recycling them into other tools later. Late Acheulian sites elsewhere pre-prepared lithic cores (&quot;Large Flake Blanks&quot;, LFB) in a variety of ways before shaping them into tools, making prepared platforms unnecessary. LFB Acheulian spreads out of Africa into West and South Asia before a million years ago and is present in Southern Europe after 600,000 years ago, but northern Europe (and the Levant after 700,000 years ago) made use of soft hammers as they mainly made use of small, thick flint nodules. The first prepared platforms in Africa come from the 450,000-year-old Fauresmith industry, transitional between the Early Stone Age (Acheulian) and the Middle Stone Age.

With either method, knappers (tool makers) would have had to have produced some item indirectly related to creating the desired product (hierarchical organisation), which could represent a major cognitive development. Experiments with modern humans have shown that platform preparation cannot be learned through purely observational learning, unlike earlier techniques, and could be indicative of well developed teaching methods as well as self-regulated learning. At Boxgrove, the knappers used not only stone but also bone and antler to make hammers, and the use of such a wide range of raw materials could speak to advanced planning capabilities as stoneworking requires a much different skillset to work and gather materials for than boneworking.

The Kapthurin Formation, Kenya, has yielded the oldest evidence of blade and bladelet technology, dating to 545 to 509 thousand years ago. This technology is rare even in the Middle Palaeolithic, and is typically associated with Upper Palaeolithic modern humans. It is unclear if this is part of a long blade-making tradition, or if blade technology was lost and reinvented several times by multiple different human species.

==== Fire and construction ====

Despite apparent pushes into colder climates, evidence of fire is scarce in the archaeological record until 400 to 300 thousand years ago. Though it is possible fire remnants simply degraded, long and overall undisturbed occupation sequences such as at Arago or Gran Dolina conspicuously lack convincing evidence of fire usage. This pattern could possibly indicate the invention of ignition technology or improved fire maintenance techniques at this time, and that fire was not an integral part of people&#x27;s lives before then in Europe. In Africa, on the other hand, humans may have been able to frequently scavenge fire as early as 1.6 million years ago from natural wildfires, which occur much more often in Africa, thus possibly (more or less) regularly using fire. The oldest established continuous fire site beyond Africa is the 780,000-year-old Gesher Benot Ya&#x27;aqov, Israel.

In Europe, evidence of constructed dwelling structures—classified as firm surface huts with solid foundations built in areas mostly sheltered from the weather—has been recorded since the Cromerian Interglacial, the earliest example a 700,000-year-old stone foundation from Přezletice, Czech Republic. This dwelling probably featured a vaulted roof made of thick branches or thin poles, supported by a foundation of big rocks and earth. Other such dwellings have been postulated to have existed during or following the Holstein Interglacial (which began 424,000 years ago) in Bilzingsleben, Germany; Terra Amata, France; and Fermanville and Saint-Germain-des-Vaux in Normandy. These were probably occupied during the winter, and, averaging only in area, they were probably only used for sleeping in, while other activities (including firekeeping) seem to have been done outside. Less-permanent tent technology may have been present in Europe in the Lower Paleolithic.

==== Spears ====

The appearance of repeated fire usage—earliest in Europe from Beeches Pit, England, and Schöningen, Germany—roughly coincides with hafting technology (attaching stone points to spears) best exemplified by the Schöningen spears. These nine wooden spears and spear fragments—in addition to a lance, and a double-pointed stick—date to 300,000 years ago and were preserved along a lakeside. The spears vary from in diameter, and may have been long, overall similar to present day competitive javelins. The spears were made of soft spruce wood, except for spear 4 which was (also soft) pine wood. This contrasts with the Clacton spearhead from Clacton-on-Sea, England, perhaps roughly 100,000 years older, which was made of hard yew wood. The Schöningen spears may have had a range of up to , though would have been more effective short range within about , making them effective distance weapons either against prey or predators. Besides these two localities, the only other site which provides solid evidence of European spear technology is the 120,000-year-old Lehringen site, district of Verden, in Lower Saxony, Germany, where a yew spear was apparently lodged in an elephant. In Africa, 500,000-year-old points from Kathu Pan 1, South Africa, may have been hafted onto spears. Judging by indirect evidence, a horse scapula from the 500,000-year-old Boxgrove shows a puncture wound consistent with a spear wound. Evidence of hafting (in both Europe and Africa) becomes much more common after 300,000 years.

=== Language ===

The SH humans had a modern humanlike hyoid bone (which supports the tongue), and middle ear bones capable of finely distinguishing frequencies within the range of normal human speech. Judging by dental striations, they seem to have been predominantly right-handed, and handedness is related to the lateralisation of brain function, typically associated with language processing in modern humans. So, it is postulated that this population was speaking with some early form of language. Nonetheless, these traits do not absolutely prove the existence of language and humanlike speech, and its presence so early in time despite such anatomical arguments has been primarily opposed by cognitive scientist Philip Lieberman.

<doc id="442645" wikidata="Q444006" url="?curid=442645" title="Wide Streets Commission">
<text>The Wide Streets Commission (officially the Commissioners for making Wide and Convenient Ways, Streets and Passages) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1758, at the request of Dublin Corporation, as a body to govern standards on the layout of streets, bridges, buildings and other architectural and civic considerations in Dublin.

Other improvement commissioners in Dublin in the same era were the Pipe Water Committee for drinking water, the Paving Board for footpaths, public lighting and sewerage, and the Ballast Board for Dublin Port.

The various improvement commissioners were abolished when with the last of their functions being absorbed into Dublin Corporation in 1851.

==History==

The Wide Streets Commission was established in 1758. Over the following decades, the commission reshaped the old medieval city of Dublin, and created a network of main thoroughfares by wholesale demolition or widening of old streets or the creation of entirely new ones.

One of the first projects was to widen &quot;Essex Bridge&quot; (now Grattan Bridge), in 1755 to cope with the traffic congestion caused by human, horse-drawn, and bovine traffic crossing the River Liffey from Capel Street. The building of Parliament Street and the &quot;Royal Exchange&quot; (now Dublin City Hall), to create a vista from across the river Liffey on Capel Street, soon followed.

Other major initiatives, under the then Chief Commissioner John Beresford, included the effort to merge and widen several narrow streets into one new street on Dublin&#x27;s northside, creating Sackville Street (now called O&#x27;Connell Street). The main north–south axis of the city was thus moved from Capel Street and Parliament Street to the new thoroughfare further east.

The widening of Dame Street, between Cork Hill and College Green was the second great initiative of the commission. This work was initiated in 1777, but it was not until 1782 that the first new building was built at Palace Street. Christchurch and George&#x27;s Street are also the result of the project of widening Georgian Dublin&#x27;s congested streets. North Frederick Street was created from 1789 linking Sackville Street and Dorset Street.

Between 1785 and 1790 further phases of the Dame Street project was undertaken between George&#x27;s Lane and Trinity Street. Drawings exist dated 1832 for the buildings between Fownes Street and Temple Lane.

Westmoreland Street (90 feet wide), and D&#x27;Olier Street (90 feet wide and designed by Henry Aaron Baker) and part of Burgh Quay (1806) including the new Corn Exchange, formed part of the work of the commission. Originally many of the new houses had 15 feet high granite shop fronts at street level which were divided into three bays, a narrow bay at each side, incorporating a door, and a wide bay at the middle of the facade for the display of goods. Many of these shopfronts still remain on the west side of d&#x27;Olier Street.

Many of the Wide Street Commission buildings can be seen today on streets with granite shopfronts at ground floor level and brick facades above. They are generally streets with standardised house designs such as Burgh Quay.

Wellington Quay – with its arcaded shop fronts – and Merchants Arch are also part of the commission&#x27;s work, as are Eden Quay, Lower Abbey Street, Bachelor&#x27;s Walk, and Beresford Place.

===Cessation===
The commission was abolished by the Dublin Improvement Act 1849 (12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. 97), with the final meeting of the commission taking place on 2 January 1851.

==Other improvement commissioners==
===Paving board===
The Paving Board had been appointed by an act of Parliament, the City of Dublin Act 1773 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 3. c. 22 (I)) of 1774, and were charged with the duty of &quot;improving the streets by paving the roadway, altering the levels, and removing encroachments&quot;. They also had the power to re-order the numbering of houses. The body operated from a house on the corner of Nassau Street and Dawson Street and later moved to Langford House on Mary Street from around 1819 when it was referred to as the Paving House.

<doc id="442647" wikidata="Q651923" url="?curid=442647" title="Young Frankenstein">
<text>Young Frankenstein is a 1974 American comedy horror film directed by Mel Brooks. The screenplay was co-written by Brooks and Gene Wilder. Wilder also starred in the lead role as the title character, a descendant of the infamous Victor Frankenstein. Peter Boyle portrayed the monster. The film co-stars Teri Garr, Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, Richard Haydn, and Gene Hackman.

The film is a parody of the classic horror film genre, in particular the various film adaptations of Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; produced by Universal Pictures in the 1930s. Much of the lab equipment used as props was created by Kenneth Strickfaden for the 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. To help evoke the atmosphere of the earlier films, Brooks shot the picture entirely in black and white, a rarity in the 1970s, and employed 1930s-style opening credits and scene transitions such as iris outs, wipes, and fades to black. The film also features a period score by Brooks&#x27; longtime composer John Morris.

A critical and commercial success, &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; ranks number 28 on &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers&#x27; &quot;List of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films of All Time&quot;, No. 56 on Bravo&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;, and No. 13 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 funniest American movies. In 2003, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States National Film Preservation Board, and selected for preservation in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay (for Wilder and Brooks) and Best Sound.

In 2014, the year of its 40th anniversary, Brooks considered it by far his finest (although not his funniest) film as a writer-director.

==Plot==
Early in the 20th century, Frederick Frankenstein, a lecturing physician at an American medical school, is actively distancing himself from his grandfather Victor Frankenstein, the infamous mad scientist, pronouncing his surname as &quot;Fronkensteen&quot;. When Frederick inherits the family castle in Transylvania, he travels to Europe to inspect the property. At the Transylvania train station, Frederick is met by a hunchbacked, bug-eyed servant named Igor, whose own grandfather worked for Victor and who states his name is pronounced &quot;Eye-gore&quot;. A young woman named Inga also greets him. Arriving at the estate, Frederick meets Frau Blücher, the dour, intimidating housekeeper. After discovering the secret entrance to Victor&#x27;s laboratory and reading his private journals, Frederick resumes his grandfather&#x27;s experiments in reanimating the dead.

Frederick and Igor steal a recently executed criminal&#x27;s corpse. He sends Igor to steal the brain of a deceased &quot;scientist and saint&quot; named Hans Delbrück. Igor accidentally destroys Delbrück&#x27;s brain and takes one labeled &quot;Abnormal&quot;. Frederick unknowingly transplants it into the corpse and brings Monster to life. Frightened by Igor lighting a match, the Monster attacks Frederick and nearly strangles him before being sedated.

Unaware the Monster exists, the townspeople gather to discuss their unease at Frederick continuing his grandfather&#x27;s work. Inspector Kemp, a one-eyed police inspector with a prosthetic arm and a heavy German accent, visits the doctors and demands assurance that Frederick would not create another monster. Returning to the lab, Frederick discovers Blücher releasing the creature. She reveals the Monster&#x27;s love of violin music, her own romantic relationship with Frederick&#x27;s grandfather, and her planning out the events that inspired Frederick to create a monster as Victor did. The Monster becomes enraged by electrical sparks from a thrown switch and escapes the castle. While roaming the countryside, the Monster interacts with a young girl and a blind, hermetic monk. Frederick recaptures the Monster and locks himself in a room with him. He calms the Monster&#x27;s homicidal tendencies with flattery and a promise to guide him to success, embracing his heritage as a Frankenstein.

At a theater filled with prominent guests, Frederick shows &quot;The Creature&quot; following simple commands, then performing a musical number with him. A stage light explodes and frightens the Monster, who becomes enraged at the booing crowd, and charges at them when they throw rotten vegetables. He is captured and chained by police. Back in the laboratory, Inga attempts to comfort Frederick; they have sex on the suspended reanimation table.

The Monster escapes from prison the same night Elizabeth, Frederick&#x27;s socialite fiancée, arrives unexpectedly. The Monster takes her captive, but she falls in love with him as he makes love to her. While the townspeople hunt the Monster, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle and recaptures him. Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frederick transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the Monster, who reasons with and placates the mob. Kemp gives the Monster a warm reception.

Sometime later, Frederick and Inga are wed, and Elizabeth marries the now-sophisticated Monster. While in bed with Frederick, Inga asks what he got in return during the transfer procedure. Frederick growls wordlessly like the monster and embraces Inga.

==Cast==
==Production==
In a 2010 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Mel Brooks discussed how the film came about:

In one of the scenes of a village assembly, one of the authority figures says that he already knows what Frankenstein is up to, based on five previous experiences. This is a reference to the first five Universal films. In a Gene Wilder DVD interview, he says the film is based on &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; (1942).

In a 2016 interview with &quot;Creative Screenwriting&quot;, Brooks elaborated on the writing process. He recalled,

Little by little, every night, Gene and I met at his bungalow at the Bel Air Hotel. We ordered a pot of Earl Grey tea coupled with a container of cream and a small kettle of brown sugar cubes. To go with it, we had a pack of British digestive biscuits. And step-by-step, ever so cautiously, we proceeded on a dark, narrow, twisting path to the eventual screenplay in which good sense and caution are thrown out the window and madness ensues.

Brooks and Wilder disagreed over the sequence where Frankenstein and his creation perform &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;. Brooks felt it was too silly to have the monster sing and dance, but eventually yielded to Wilder&#x27;s arguments.

Unlike in many of his other films, Brooks does not appear onscreen in a significant role in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, though he recorded several voice parts and portrays a German villager in one short scene. In 2012, Brooks explained why:

 I wasn&#x27;t allowed to be in it. That was the deal Gene Wilder had. He [said], &#x27;If you&#x27;re not in it, I&#x27;ll do it.&#x27; [Laughs.] He [said], &quot;You have a way of breaking the fourth wall, whether you want to or not. I just want to keep it. I don&#x27;t want too much to be, you know, a wink at the audience. I love the script.&#x27; He wrote the script with me. That was the deal. So I wasn&#x27;t in it, and he did it.

Brooks and producer Michael Gruskoff originally agreed to a deal with Columbia Pictures, but Columbia would not agree to a budget of more than $1.75 million, whereas Brooks wanted at least $2.3 million. Columbia also was not happy making it in black and white, so Brooks and Gruskoff instead went to 20th Century-Fox for distribution when they agreed to a higher budget.

Principal photography began on February 19, 1974, and wrapped on May 3, 1974. To recreate the visual style of the original Universal horror films, Brooks shot in black and white, employed vintage-style opening credits, used wipes and irises for scene transitions, and even used the original Kenneth Strickfaden lab equipment from the 1931 &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

Marty Feldman added a comic twist to his character by swapping which side the hump on his back was located; when Doctor Frankenstein asks him about it, Igor replies simply: &quot;What hump?&quot; Wilder wrote the role specially for Feldman.

==Reception==
&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; was a box-office success upon release. The film grossed $86.2 million on a $2.78 million budget.

&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; received acclaim from critics and currently holds a 95% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Made with obvious affection for the original, &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is a riotously silly spoof featuring a fantastic performance by Gene Wilder.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;Mel Brooks&#x27; funniest, most cohesive comedy to date,&quot; adding, &quot;It would be misleading to describe &#x27;Young Frankenstein,&#x27; written by Mr. Wilder and Mr. Brooks, as astoundingly witty, but it&#x27;s a great deal of low fun of the sort that Mr. Brooks specializes in.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars, calling it Brooks&#x27; &quot;most disciplined and visually inventive film (it also happens to be very funny).&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Part homage and part send-up, &#x27;Young Frankenstein&#x27; is very funny in its best moments, but they&#x27;re all too infrequent.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;The screen needs one outrageously funny Mel Brooks film each year, and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is an excellent followup for the enormous audiences that howled for much of 1974 at &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;.&#x27;&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;a likable, unpredictable blending of slapstick and sentiment.&quot;Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; who disliked &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, reported being &quot;equally untickled&quot; with &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; and wrote that &quot;Wilder and Brooks haven&#x27;t dreamed up a funny plot. They simply rely on the old movie plots to get them through a rambling collection of scene parodies and a more or less constant stream of puns, double entendres and other verbal rib-pokers and thigh-slappers.&quot; Tom Milne of the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote in a mixed review that &quot;all too often Brooks resorts to the most clichéd sort of &quot;Carry On&quot; smut&quot; and criticized Marty Feldman&#x27;s &quot;grotesquely unfunny mugging,&quot; but praised a couple of sequences (the flower-throwing scene and the Monster&#x27;s encounter with the blind man) as &quot;very close to brilliance&quot; and called Peter Boyle as the Monster &quot;one of the undiluted pleasures of the film (and the only actor ever to suggest that he might play the part as well as Karloff).&quot;

In his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008&quot;, Bruce G. Hallenbeck lauded many of &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;″s scenes as classic comedy moments, and also praised the attention to detail the film shows in paying heartfelt homage to the classic horror films it references. He summed up that &quot;&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is a movie for film buffs, but written, directed, and performed in such a way that average Joes and Josephines can enjoy it just as much for its outrageous and wacky humor.&quot;

==&quot;Walk this way&quot;==
Igor&#x27;s line &quot;Walk this way&quot; in the film inspired the song of the same name by Aerosmith. According to Gene Wilder, the joke was added while shooting the scene by Mel Brooks, inspired by the old &quot;talcum powder&quot; joke. A partially contradictory account appears in &quot;eyE Marty&quot;, Feldman&#x27;s posthumously published autobiography: Feldman recalls spontaneously doing the &quot;walk this way&quot; shtick to make his colleagues laugh, with Brooks then insisting, despite Wilder and Feldman&#x27;s reservations, that it stay in the film.

==Home media==
&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; became available on DVD on November 3, 1998. The film was then released on DVD for the second time on September 5, 2006. The film was then released on DVD for the third time on September 9, 2014, as a 40th-anniversary edition along with a Blu-ray release.

==Musical adaptation==

Brooks adapted the film into a musical of the same name, which premiered in Seattle at the Paramount Theatre and ran from August 7 to September 1, 2007. The musical opened on Broadway at the Lyric Theatre (then the Hilton Theatre) on November 8, 2007, and closed on January 4, 2009. It was nominated for three Tony Awards, and starred Roger Bart, Sutton Foster, Shuler Hensley, Megan Mullally, Christopher Fitzgerald, and Andrea Martin.

The musical version was to be used as the basis of a live-broadcast event on the ABC network in the last quarter of 2020, with Brooks producing, but it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="442657" wikidata="Q1585828" url="?curid=442657" title="Harold G. Hoffman">
<text>Harold Giles Hoffman (February 7, 1896 – June 4, 1954) was an American businessman and Republican Party politician who served as the 41st Governor of New Jersey from 1935 to 1938. His time in office was marked by controversy over his support for a sales tax and interference in the Lindbergh kidnapping case. He died while subject to an investigation for embezzlement from his bank and the state government, which he confessed to his daughter before his death.

Hoffman also served two terms representing Middlesex, Monmouth, and Ocean counties (as New Jersey&#x27;s 3rd congressional district) in the United States House of Representatives from 1927 to 1931, represented Middlesex in the New Jersey General Assembly, and served as mayor of South Amboy.

==Early life and education==
Harold Giles Hoffman was born on February 7, 1896, in South Amboy, New Jersey, to Frank Hoffman and Ada Crawford Thom. His mother was the daughter of the painter James Crawford Thom and the granddaughter of Scottish sculptor James Thom. His father&#x27;s ancestors included the earliest European settlers in New Amsterdam from Sweden and Dutch nobility.

Hoffman attended public schools and worked as a local newspaper reporter while still in high school. Upon graduating from South Amboy High School in 1913, he joined the &quot;Perth Amboy Evening News&quot; as a full-time employee, becoming assistant city editor and sports editor. He left the newspaper after a dispute with the owner and worked at the Du Pont Laboratory in Parlin.

=== World War I ===
Hoffman enlisted in the Third Infantry of the New Jersey National Guard on July 25, 1917, 3 months after the United States declaration of war on Germany. The division soon became the 114th Infantry of the 29th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces.

He saw action in the Meuse-Argonne offensive and was promoted to captain on the battlefield before returning home. He was eventually discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

=== Banking career ===
After World War I, Hoffman returned to South Amboy and became an executive with the South Amboy Trust Company. Over the next decades, he built a career as a prominent South Amboy businessman, serving as vice president of the Trust Company, president of a real estate corporation, president of a mortgage company, treasurer of another realty and investment corporation, and director of a building and loan association. He became well known throughout the state banking community.

==Early political career==

Hoffman was engaged in South Amboy and Middlesex County Republican Party politics from an early age. He was appointed treasurer of South Amboy and entered elected office as an Assemblyman in 1923.

In 1925, Hoffman won a write-in campaign for mayor and served as secretary to Senate President Morgan Foster Larson.

In 1926, Hoffman was elected to the United States House of Representatives from the 3rd congressional district (which consisted of Middlesex, Monmouth, and Ocean counties) by a wide margin over Fred De Voe, despite the district&#x27;s usual Democratic lean. He won re-election over John R. Phillips Jr. in 1928. Though his career in Washington was undistinguished, his electoral success also earned him the chair of the Middlesex County Republican Party and a prominent role in the state party hierarchy.

When Morgan Larson was elected Governor of New Jersey in 1928, he appointed Hoffman to a four-year term as the state Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Hoffman continued to hold his seat in Congress until it expired in 1931 and used the position to its full advantage as a platform to raise his public image and build a national reputation as a spokesman for highway safety, a relatively new issue at the time. After his term as commissioner expired in 1933, Hoffman worked to build a loyal statewide political organization by campaigning on behalf of other candidates throughout the state.

== Governor of New Jersey ==

=== 1934 election ===

In 1934, Hoffman initially considered challenging incumbent U.S. Senator Hamilton Fish Kean before being persuaded to seek the Republican nomination for Governor. Hoffman won the primary with a majority of the vote over State Senators Emerson L. Richards and Joseph G. Wolber and judge Robert Carey.

In the general election, Hoffman faced his predecessor as commissioner of motor vehicles, William L. Dill. Dill was a political client of Jersey City boss Frank Hague. The campaign was low-key, with Hoffman avoiding strong stance on the issues and each candidate accusing the other of bossism. Hoffman won in an upset, becoming the first Republican elected Governor of New Jersey outside of a presidential election year since 1907. After his election, some accused Hague of selling out Dill to get Hoffman elected and branded Hoffman a &quot;Hague Republican,&quot; but Hoffman&#x27;s personal popularity nevertheless made him a potential contender for national office.

=== Term in office (1935–1938) ===
Hoffman&#x27;s tenure in office was marked by controversy and notoriety.

As governor, Hoffman got into at least two separate fistfights with reporters.

He entered office in the midst of the Great Depression and the transfer of authority from states and municipalities to the federal government via New Deal relief programs, but most responsibility still fell to state government to address the crisis.

Among his first acts in office was to call for a state sales tax, an unpopular issue he had avoided addressing during the campaign. The proposal for any new tax was opposed by most Republicans, businesses, and taxpayers&#x27; associations; Hoffman instead turned to Frank Hague and urban Democrats to pass the legislation, and only six months into his term, the &quot;unholy deal&quot; dramatically undermined Hoffman&#x27;s popularity in his own party and brought the enmity of Essex Republican Arthur T. Vanderbilt. In the 1935 Republican primaries, Vanderbilt&#x27;s &quot;Clean Government Group&quot; made serious inroads, and Hoffman was forced to sign a sales tax repeal in October; he dramatically chose to sign the bill in red ink, symbolizing in his words, an &quot;unbalanced budget and maybe hungry people.&quot;

==== Involvement in Hauptmann case ====
Hoffman drew further controversy on October 16, 1935, when he made a dramatic visit to the death row cell of Bruno Hauptmann, awaiting execution for the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh Jr. Hoffman believed Hauptmann had not acted alone, and claimed to hope to convince the convict to reveal his conspirators. He urged the other members of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, the state&#x27;s highest court, to visit Hauptmann.

Just before Hauptmann&#x27;s scheduled execution in January 1936, Hoffman granted him a thirty-day reprieve (while declaring he held no position on Hauptmann&#x27;s guilt) and ordered the state police to reopen the investigation. During that time, Hoffman gained further disrepute when detective Ellis Parker conducted an independent investigation in which Parker kidnapped and coerced Paul Wendel, a Trenton attorney, into confessing to aiding Hauptmann.

Hoffman attempted to grant a second reprieve, but it was blocked. Hoffman said he would not grant another reprieve and Hauptmann was executed on April 3, 1936.

==== 1936 presidential campaign and 1937 election ====
Despite his declining popularity, Hoffman still harbored ambitions for the presidency, and his associates sought to first make him the undisputed favorite of the New Jersey delegation. However, strong sympathy for Alf Landon in the state and the continued opposition from Vanderbilt&#x27;s Clean Government Group nixed his chances.

Though Hoffman was elected as a delegate to the 1936 Republican National Convention, he barely defeated a vigorous campaign from former U.S. Representative Franklin William Fort for the spot, and the other three delegates were critics of the Governor. The political blow left him an effective lame duck for the remainder of his term, and he focused on setting himself up to run for Governor again in 1940.

In the 1937 election, Hoffman&#x27;s preferred candidate for Governor Clifford R. Powell lost the Republican nomination to Lester H. Clee, a Clean Government luminary who made his opposition to Hoffman central to the campaign. Clee narrowly lost the general election.

=== 1940 election ===

In 1940, having maneuvered himself an appointment as executive director of the state Unemployment Compensation Commission, Hoffman attempted to return to office as governor. This time, he had the strong and open support of Frank Hague, and he lost the Republican primary to Robert C. Hendrickson, another Clean Government candidate. Hoffman refused to support the nominee, and Hendrickson lost the election to Charles Edison.

== Later career ==
In 1939, Hoffman was named president of the minor league baseball Interstate League.

During World War II, Hoffman took military leave from the Unemployment Compensation Commission. He reentered the army as a major in the Transportation Corps on June 15, 1942, and served until June 24, 1946, when he was discharged with the rank of colonel. Upon discharge, Hoffman resumed his position as director of the Unemployment Commission.

During the Alfred Driscoll administration, Hoffman resigned to become the first director of the state Division of Employment Security within the Department of Labor and Industry.

In this period, Hoffman made several appearances on radio and television panel shows:

* In 1948, he appeared on the short-lived ABC network program &quot;That Reminds Me&quot;. 
* On June 12, 1948, he was a guest panelist on the joke-themed radio program Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One. 
* On February 2, 1950, Hoffman was one of four panelists on the debut presentation of the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;
* On February 16, 1950, he made a return appearance on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; 
* In 1953, Hoffman appeared as a panelist on the NBC radio joke-telling program &quot;Can You Top This?&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1919, Hoffman married Lillie May Moss, the daughter of a prominent South Amboy dentist.

==Embezzlement investigation and death==
On March 18, 1954, newly inaugurated Governor Robert B. Meyner suddenly suspended Hoffman from his role at the Division of Employment and charged him with irregular purchases. For weeks, the charges remained unsubstantiated, and Hoffman&#x27;s political allies accused Meyner of a political witch hunt. On June 4, Hoffman died in a New York City hotel room of a heart attack, intensifying the attacks on Meyner.

Several weeks later, the government released a thorough case against Hoffman, substantiated by a letter to his daughter shortly before his death revealing a long trail of corruption which lasted throughout his career. In the letter, Hoffman admitted to embezzling over $300,000 from the South Amboy Trust Company to pay off early campaign debts after a &quot;certain wealthy elder candidate, who is now deceased&quot; reneged on a promise to cover the debts. Then, from at least 1949 onwards, Hoffman admitted he had used state funds to cover the South Amboy Trust Company&#x27;s shortages. In addition to these confessions, other charges arose against the former governor and his associates, including the revelation that another state official had blackmailed Hoffman for $150,000 to keep the embezzlement hidden. In the letter to his daughter, Hoffman wrote, &quot;Morality, in its ultimate determination, is a funny thing.&quot;

Hoffman is buried in Christ Church Cemetery in South Amboy, New Jersey.

<doc id="442661" wikidata="Q367035" url="?curid=442661" title="Address book">
<text>An address book or a name and address book is a book, or a database used for storing entries, called contacts. Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: first name, last name, company name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, mobile phone number). Most such systems store the details in alphabetical order of people&#x27;s names, although in paper-based address books entries can easily end up out of order as the owner inserts details of more individuals or as people move. Many address books use small ring binders that allow adding, removing, and shuffling of pages to make room.

== Little black book ==
The 1953 film version of &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; features a musical scene in which Howard Keel&#x27;s character laments the loss of the social life he enjoyed before marriage, naming numerous female romantic encounters while perusing a miniature black book, which has given rise to the trope of a &quot;little black book&quot; referring to a list of past or potential sexual partners.
== Software address book ==

Address books can also appear as software designed for this purpose, such as the &quot;Contacts&quot; application included with Apple Inc.&#x27;s Mac OS. Simple address books have been incorporated into email software for many years, though more advanced versions have emerged in the 1990s and beyond, and in mobile phones (a SIM card can store entries).

A personal information manager (PIM) integrates an address book, calendar, task list, and sometimes other features.

Entries can be imported and exported from the software to transfer them between programs or computers. The common file formats for these operations are:
* LDIF (*.ldif, *.ldi)
* Tab delimited (*.tab, *.txt)
* Comma-separated (*.csv)
* vCard (*.vcf)

Individual entries are frequently transferred as vCards (*.vcf), which are comparable to physical business cards. And some software applications like Lotus Notes and Open Contacts can handle a vCard file containing multiple vCard records.

== Online address book ==
An online address book typically enables users to create their own web page (or profile page), which is then indexed by search engines like Google and Bing. This in turn enables users to be found by other people via a search of their name and then contacted via their web page containing their personal information. Ability to find people registered with online address books via search engine searches usually varies according to the commonness of the name and the number of results for the name. Typically, users of such systems can synchronize their contact details with other users that they know to ensure that their contact information is kept up to date.

== Network address book ==
Many people have many different address books: their email accounts, their mobile phone, and the &quot;friends lists&quot; on their social networking services. A network address book allows them to organize and manage their address books through one interface and share their contacts across their different address books and social networks

<text>Wenden is a municipality in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It belongs to the Olpe district in the Sauerland. It lies south of Olpe and northwest of Siegen.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Wenden lies at the southernmost tip of the Sauerland, an area of low mountain ranges. The Bigge and its tributaries, which feed into Biggesee, rise near Wenden. To the southeast a ridge separates the municipality from the adjoining Siegerland. In the southwest the municipal area borders Rhineland-Palatinate.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Bordering on Wenden are Olpe and Drolshagen, which like Wenden lie in the Olpe district, Friesenhagen in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Altenkirchen district, Kreuztal, Freudenberg and Siegen (all in Siegen-Wittgenstein), and also Reichshof in the Oberbergischer Kreis.

=== Constituent communities ===
The community consists of three major villages: Wenden (3900 inhabitants), Hünsborn (3100) and Ottfingen (2200). Smaller villages are: Altenhof, Altenwenden, Brün, Eichen, Elben, Gerlingen, Heid, Hillmicke, Möllmicke, Römershagen, Rothemühle, Schönau and Vahlberg. Additionally, there are some hamlets: Bebbingen, Büchen, Döingen, Eichertshof, Girkhausen, Hoffnung, Huppen, Löffelberg, Rothenborn, Scheiderwald, Schwarzbruch, Trömbach, Wendenerhütte and Wilhelmstal.

=== Climate ===
Wenden&#x27;s climate is very wet. West winds bring clouds that form over the Atlantic Ocean and they rise as they pass over the Sauerland and Wenden, which in turn brings rain. The coldest month is January. July is the warmest month. During winter fog forms frequently out of the moist air.

== History ==
The origins of the name Wenden are not known for certain. Probably it has to do with the location because at the turn of the first millennium within its area the lands of two Germanic people, the Franks and the Saxons met. There is no knowledge as to when the area was first settled. The names of some villages like Girkhausen, Bebbingen, Döingen, Gerlingen and Ottfingen as well as the names of lost villages and homesteads offer some clues. Most likely settlement must have taken place no later than around 900 to 1000 AD. Perhaps the area knew settlements even earlier as the names of local brooks and streams like Elbe, Albe, Wende, Bigge, Benze and Binse hint.

The first documented record of Wenden dates back to 1011. By that time a monastery had been founded in Herford and given land in &quot;Wendenne&quot;, which is said to mean turn (). At the beginning of the 14th century a chapel &quot;Wendene capella&quot; is mentioned in a copy of a much older tax register of the Archdiocese of Cologne. Watersheds have been Wenden&#x27;s limits for centuries. In the southeast and east these watersheds marked the boundary with the territory of Nassau-Siegen, in the south to the land of the counts of Wildenburg and in the south and southwest to the Duchy of Berg. All of the municipal area was part of the Electorate of Cologne. Following the Reformation they remained Catholic while their neighbours to the southeast, south and southwest converted to Protestantism.

By the end of the Middle Ages people in the Siegerland fenced off their territory with a combination of trenches, earthworks and dense hedgerows. That part which touches the district of Olpe is called the &quot;Kölsches Heck&quot; (&quot;Cologne hedge&quot;). The &quot;Kölsches Heck&quot; also marks a boundary between two languages High German and Low German. After the Reformation it came to mark the border between areas of different faiths.

In 1803 the municipal area of Wenden was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt and in 1816 it was annexed to Prussia. Some years later in 1850 the municipalities of Wenden and Römershagen were joined to form the new municipality of Wenden (&quot;Amt Wenden&quot;).

=== Religion ===
The great majority of the community dwellers adhere to the Catholic faith. With the exception of Möllmicke and Rothemühle, each of the community&#x27;s bigger centres has a Catholic church or chapel at its disposal. After the Second World War many Germans driven out of the lost territories in the east moved into what was then the &quot;Amt&quot; of Wenden; they settled mostly in the centres of Vahlberg and Rothemühle. Thus arose the Evangelical Church of Rothemühle in the 1950s. In the 1980s there came a community centre in Wenden&#x27;s main town which quickly outdid the church in Rothemühle. In 2006, a resolution was handed down by the Evangelical parish of Olpe, to which Wenden belongs, to abandon the church in Rothemühle. The Rothemühle chapel building club thereupon took over financial responsibility for the church, guaranteeing its continued existence for the time being. In the 1960s, many Muslims and Greek Orthodox Christians also came to the community of Wenden. For a few years, a mosque has been maintained in Wenden&#x27;s main centre. A regionally important pilgrimage centre for Catholics is the Dörnschlade, found in the middle of the woods between the centres of Hünsborn, Wenden and Altenhof. According to legend, a Madonna statue stolen from the Wenden church was found there. A chapel is used by many believers for worship. Among others, the regional &quot;Katholische Arbeitnehmer-Bewegung&quot; (“Catholic Employees’ Movement”, KAB) uses the Dörnschlade for its yearly pilgrimage.

=== Amalgamations ===
The community of Wenden came into being in 1969 in the course of municipal restructuring in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is coëxtensive with the former &quot;Amt&quot; of Wenden, which itself consisted of the communities of Wenden and Römershagen.

== Politics ==

=== Mayor ===
*1994–2015: Peter Brüser, CDU
*2015–incumbent: Bernd Clemens, CDU

=== Town partnerships ===
A partnership came about as a result of German unity with Dingelstädt in the former East Germany. The partnership was at first actively pursued, for instance through administrative employees’ exchanges, and continues today at a lower, but constant, level. For example, Dingelstädt&#x27;s mayor is a regular guest at the great yearly event known as the Wendener Kirmes.

Currently, groundwork is being laid to build a partnership with the Hungarian town of Lepsény. The packaging firm SiBO maintains branch offices in both Wenden and Lepsény. Owner Bernd Hesse blazed the trail for this budding partnership.

== Culture and sightseeing ==

=== Theatre ===
The Sauerland-Theater Hillmicke is a successful amateur theatre, and performs every November in the Wenden school centre&#x27;s auditorium.

=== Museums ===
The Wendener Hütte is a technological cultural monument and one of the oldest still preserved charcoal furnace works in the German-speaking world. It can be viewed free during opening hours.

=== Music ===
The community of Wenden is well known for its great number of concert bands, music clubs, bands and choirs. Almost every centre has a concert band and several choirs at its disposal. The &quot;Spielmannszug Wenden&quot; (band) celebrates its centenary in 2008, holding a great festival weekend on 18–20 April.

=== Buildings ===

The Dörnschlade pilgrimage chapel was built in the mid 19th century and is found near Altenhof. It can easily be reached by the road running between Hünsborn and Wenden. On the Sundays after the Festivals of the Assumption (2 July) and the Nativity of Mary (8 September), a procession from Altenhof and Wenden to the Dörnschlade takes place, which is then finished with a church service there.

The St. Severinus parish church was built about 1750. The altars and most holy figures already adorned the forerunner church, from which also came the bulky tower, the new church having been built over the old one, which was then only knocked down after construction on the new one was well under way. The holy objects were all transferred to the new church. The pulpit, the Resplendent Madonna and the organ, however, were acquired new in 1755. The new church&#x27;s namesake may have been St. Severin&#x27;s Church in Cologne. The last thorough renovation was done between 1986 and 1988, with the church being made over as far as possible to look as it did when it was built in the 18th century.

=== Natural monuments ===
The source of the river Bigge lies near Römershagen. The stream, where it rises is still only very small, runs for 16 km, then filling one of Germany&#x27;s biggest reservoirs, the Biggesee.

=== Sport ===
*The &quot;Vereinigte Sport-Vereine Wenden 1930 e. V. &quot; in Wenden-Schönau (football) played in the Verbandsliga until 2003, but are now in the Landesliga. They have an artificial-turf pitch at their disposal.
*The DAC 01, Wenden plays skittles in a Landesliga at the &quot;Bundeskegelbahn Gasthof Wurm&quot; (“Bützers”) in Schönau.
*The SG Wenden already boasts various successes in athletics, among them Simon Huckestein, sixth in the 2005 German Championship over 800 m. The club was built up significantly by squad trainer Egon Bröcher&#x27;s work, and by Kunibert Rademacher (currently the chairman for district athletics). The club organizes the traditional Südsauerlandlauf (“South Sauerland Walk”) which draws up to 800 participants. It is held every year on the first weekend in November. Training is done on the Tartan track at the Gerlingen sporting grounds and at the gymnasium at the Wenden school centre.

=== Regular events ===
*The &quot;Wendsche Kärmetze&quot; (Kirmes) is held on the third Tuesday in August as well as on the Saturday and Sunday before that. On Tuesday there is an animal show with prizes awarded to animals in various classes. Another thing that sets the &quot;Wendsche Kärmetze&quot; apart is that throughout the time when it is being held, there is a market at which the most varied things are for sale. Besides the many market dealers, many amusement ride operators bring their carousels and other attractions. The Wenden Kirmes is the biggest event of its kind in the South Westphalia area.
*The &quot;Schönauer Karneval&quot; is a high point at Carnival time in South Westphalia celebrated with, besides the &quot;Prinzenproklamation&quot; (about 11 November), &quot;Altweiber&quot; (“Old Women’s Day”), &quot;Prunksitzung&quot; (a sitting of the “Elves’ Council” – actually a revue) and &quot;Rosenmontagszug&quot; (“Shrove Monday Parade”) also with three further events under marquees. Elaborate floats and many groups on foot on Shrove Monday combine to form a miles-long lindworm that wends its way through Schönau&#x27;s streets watched by 15,000 onlookers in this centre of only 1,400 souls. The Schönau carneys’ battle call goes &quot;“Schönau Helau”&quot;. The club song begins with the lines &quot;“Von Schönau bis Bockenbach – da wird geschunkelt und gelacht”&quot; (roughly “From Schönau to Bockenbach – there will be swaying to and fro and laughing”), Bockenbach being a neighbouring place in the Siegerland. Over more than 40 years, the Schönau-Altenwenden Carnival Club has established itself very firmly in South Westphalian Carnival life. Its two dancing guards, the &quot;Rote&quot; and &quot;Blaue Funken&quot; (Red and Blue Sparks), represent the club at many regional and national events.
*The &quot;Ottfinger Schützenfest&quot; (“Ottfingen Shooting Festival”) is traditionally held on the third weekend in June and is the biggest of its kind in the community of Wenden. The festival begins with a parade through the village, with the new King and Queen being determined thereafter in a bird-shooting contest. The high point is the joint celebrating in the marksmen&#x27;s tent on Saturday evening.
*The &quot;Südsauerlandlauf&quot;, a traditional walking event that held its 30th edition in 2005 is usually held on the first weekend in November by the Sportgemeinschaft Wenden (“Wenden Sport Association”). In past years, the event has even welcomed successful walking aces such as Sabrina Mockenhaupt in 2005. There are the &quot;Bambinilauf&quot; (500 m), &quot;Schülerläufe&quot; (2 km for schoolchildren), &quot;Volkslauf&quot; (5 km for the general public), Hauptlauf (the “main” walk of 10 km) and Nordic Walking (9 km) which draw up to 800 participants, making it the biggest walking event in South Westphalia. It has been integrated as a walking event into the &quot;Ausdauer-Cup&quot;.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
The economic development of the area depended mostly on iron ore and heavy spar deposits as well as an abundance of wood and water. In 1855 there were 7 smelting works in the district of Olpe, 5 of which lay in the Wenden municipal area. While most smelting works produced pig iron, the &quot;Wendener Hütte&quot;, a mill founded by Johannes Elmert in 1728, made crude steel. Like others which fired their blast furnaces with locally produced charcoal, the &quot;Wendener Hütte&quot; lost out to the developing coal-based steel industry in the Ruhr Area. The &quot;Wendener Hütte&quot; closed down in 1866. In the years after World War II the majority of the local population was working in agriculture. But when farming changed to more intensive farming with larger farms specialising in cattle and dairy farming, most small farmers gave up. People shifted out of farming and sought employment in manufacturing in neighbouring Olpe and the Siegerland.

This all changed when Bundesautobahn 45 was completed in 1971 and Bundesautobahn 4 opened to traffic in 1976. With quick access to other areas of Germany, Wenden was able to attract larger operations and build a solid economic infrastructure.

=== Established enterprises ===

=== Transport ===

====Roads====
The community of Wenden is connected to two Autobahnen, the A4 (Aachen–Görlitz, links the area to Cologne in the west) and the A45 (connects Wenden northwards to Dortmund and the Ruhr Area and southwards to Giessen and Frankfurt), both with an interchange at Wenden at the Olpe-Süd Autobahn cross. There are, however, no Federal highways (&quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;) running through the community. The main thoroughfares are the highways (&quot;Landstraßen&quot;) L342, L512, L564, L714 and L905.

The eastward extension of the A4 in 2006 connects it to the Hüttentalstrasse linking Wenden to Kreuztal and Siegen.

====Bus and rail transport====
For local public road transport there are many bus lines that also join Wenden with neighbouring communities. Operators are the &quot;Verkehrsbetriebe Westfalen-Süd&quot; (VWS, “Westphalia-South Transport Services”), whose seat is in Siegen and which is a daughter company of the &quot;Stadtwerke Bonn&quot;, and the railway daughter company &quot;Busverkehr Ruhr-Sieg&quot; (BRS, “Ruhr-Sieg Bus Transport”). Lines R50 and R51 are the most important buslines, running from Siegen and Olpe to Wenden.

Nowadays there is no longer any rail transport in the municipal area. There was formerly a rail connection to the &quot;Biggetalbahn&quot; (railway). The stretch running between Freudenberg and Rothemühle, however, was abandoned by 1987, while the Rothemühle-Olpe stretch had its service withdrawn in 2000, and in 2005 it was dismantled.

<doc id="442668" wikidata="Q1471230" url="?curid=442668" title="History of the World, Part I">
<text>History of the World, Part I is a 1981 American comedy film written, produced, and directed by Mel Brooks. Brooks also stars in the film, playing five roles: Moses, Comicus the stand-up philosopher, Tomás de Torquemada, King Louis XVI, and Jacques, &quot;le garçon de pisse&quot;. The large ensemble cast also features Sid Caesar, Shecky Greene, Gregory Hines (in his film debut), Charlie Callas; and Brooks regulars Ron Carey, Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, Andreas Voutsinas, and Spike Milligan.

The film also has cameo appearances by Royce D. Applegate, Bea Arthur, Nigel Hawthorne, Hugh Hefner, John Hurt, Phil Leeds, Barry Levinson, Jackie Mason, Paul Mazursky, Andrew Sachs and Henny Youngman, among others. Orson Welles narrates each story.

Despite carrying the numeration &quot;Part I&quot;, there were originally no plans for a sequel. The title is a play on &quot;The History of the World&quot; by Sir Walter Raleigh, which was intended to be published in several volumes but only the first was completed. However, four decades later, Hulu announced the miniseries &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot;, which premiered on March 6, 2023.

==Plot==

The film is a parody of the epic film genre, including the sword and sandal epic and the period costume drama subgenres. The four main segments consist of stories set during the Stone Age, the Roman Empire, the Spanish Inquisition, and the French Revolution. Other intermediate skits include reenactments of the giving of the Ten Commandments and the Last Supper.

===The Stone Age===
Cavemen (including Sid Caesar) depict the invention of fire, the first artist (which in turn gives rise to the first critic), the first marriages (heterosexual and then homosexual), primitive weapons (particularly spears), and the first funerals. Also depicted are early attempts at comedy and music, by smashing each other&#x27;s feet with rocks and thus creating an orchestra of howls.

===The Old Testament===
Moses (Mel Brooks) comes down from Mount Sinai carrying three stone tablets, having received the Law from God (the voice of an uncredited Carl Reiner). As Moses announces the giving of the Law to the people, he drops one of the tablets, which shatters, and he &quot;corrects&quot; his proclamation from 15 Commandments to 10.

===The Roman Empire===
Comicus (Brooks) is a &quot;stand-up philosopher&quot;, dispensing wisdom in the style of a stand-up comedian. He is notified by his agent Swiftus (Ron Carey) that he has landed a gig at Caesar&#x27;s palace. En route, he meets and falls in love with a Vestal Virgin named Miriam (Mary-Margaret Humes) and befriends an Ethiopian slave named Josephus (Gregory Hines).

Josephus is conscripted into the service of the Empress Nympho (Madeline Kahn). Comicus performs for Emperor Nero (Dom DeLuise), unwisely joking about the emperor&#x27;s weight and corruption. Josephus absentmindedly pours a jug of wine into Nero&#x27;s lap, and they are ordered to perform a gladiatorial fight to the death. They instead fight their way out of the palace, assisted by Miriam and Empress Nympho.

Comicus, Josephus, and Swiftus briefly take refuge in Nympho&#x27;s palace, posing as eunuch guards. When Josephus&#x27; visible arousal exposes them both as imposters, they are chased by soldiers led by Marcus Vindictus (Shecky Greene). They escape in a cart pulled by a horse named Miracle, lighting a huge marijuana joint to put the pursuing soldiers into a stupor.

They sail to Judea, where Comicus takes a job waiting tables, and blunders into a private room where Jesus is having the Last Supper with his disciples. Comicus interrupts Jesus (John Hurt) repeatedly (using his name in the modern sense, as an interjection). Leonardo da Vinci (Art Metrano) arrives to paint the group&#x27;s portrait, directing them to all sit on the same side of the table, with Comicus behind Jesus, where his raised platter looks like a halo.

===The Spanish Inquisition===
The Spanish Inquisition segment parodies a grandiose Busby Berkeley-style production, consisting of an extended song-and-dance number featuring Brooks as the infamous Torquemada. The sequence opens with a herald introducing Torquemada and making a play on his name; despite pleas for mercy from the condemned, &quot;you can&#x27;t Torquemada anything&quot; (talk him outta anything). Instances of comical torture include auto-da-fé, a spinning iron maiden, and &quot;water torture&quot; re-imagined with nuns performing an Esther Williams-style aquatic ballet. Jackie Mason and Ronny Graham supply cameos as Jewish torture victims.

===The French Revolution===
In her Paris tavern, Madame Defarge (Cloris Leachman) incites a mob to plot the French Revolution. Meanwhile, King Louis of France (Brooks) is warned by his advisors, Count de Monet (Harvey Korman) and Béarnaise (Andreas Voutsinas), that the peasants do not think he likes them — a suspicion reinforced by the king&#x27;s use of peasants as targets in a game of skeet. A beautiful woman, Mademoiselle Rimbaud (Pamela Stephenson), asks King Louis to free her father, who has been imprisoned in the Bastille for 10 years, which he agrees to only if she will have sex with him that night.

De Monet persuades King Louis to go into hiding, and look-alike Jacques (also Brooks) – whose job is to hold buckets for the aristocrats to urinate into – is chosen to impersonate the king as a decoy. That night, Rimbaud visits Jacques – believing him to be Louis – to consummate the deal to free her father, but he pardons him without requiring sexual favors. After Rimbaud and her senile father (Spike Milligan) return from the prison, peasants burst into the room and take &quot;King&quot; Jacques to the guillotine. When Rimbaud exclaims that &quot;only a miracle can save him&quot;, Josephus inexplicably arrives in the cart pulled by Miracle, and they escape, riding off toward a mountain carved with the words &quot;THE END&quot;.

===Previews of coming attractions===
The end of the film presents a mock teaser trailer for &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot;, &quot;coming soon&quot;. The trailer is narrated by Brooks, and shows clips of segments &quot;Hitler on Ice&quot;, &quot;A Viking Funeral&quot;, and &quot;Jews in Space&quot; (a parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot;).

==Production==
Brooks recalled that the inspiration for the film came about from an incident in 1979:
Richard Pryor was to play the role of Josephus, but two days before he was to shoot his part he was hospitalized with serious burns in a much-publicized incident. Brooks was about to write the part out when Madeline Kahn suggested Gregory Hines. 
John Cleese was originally scheduled to play &quot;Count de Monet&quot; but due to scheduling conflicts Harvey Korman was instead cast.

Orson Welles was slated to do five days worth of voice recording sessions as the Narrator, but he did his lines in just a few hours.

Comicus&#x27;s arrival at Caesar&#x27;s palace was filmed at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas.

One scene was removed from the final cut of the film that referred to the Three Mile Island accident. &quot;I had a father and a mother,&quot; Brooks said, &quot;made up to look like half a dog and half a cat as a result of a nuclear meltdown. But the audience was seriously chilled and didn&#x27;t laugh, so I left it out.&quot;

==Release==
===Critical reception===
The film holds an approval rating of 61% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;History of the World Part 1&quot; may not have enough comedic inspiration to merit a Part 2, but the sporadic cleverness of these anachronistic skits are [sic] still a testament to Mel Brooks&#x27; gift of farce&quot;. It was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1981 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;. The revised ballot, released in 2007, removed its Worst Picture nomination and instead nominated it for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy (which it won). It also garnered a Worst Song nomination at the same ceremony for &quot;The Inquisition&quot; (lost to &quot;Baby Talk&quot; from &quot;Paternity&quot;).

Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and described it as &quot;a rambling, undisciplined, sometimes embarrassing failure from one of the most gifted comic filmmakers around. What went wrong? Brooks never seems to have a clear idea of the rationale of his movie, so there&#x27;s no confident narrative impetus to carry it along.&quot; Gene Siskel, however, gave it three stars out of four and said that even though the film &quot;borrows heavily from [Brooks&#x27;] previous work,&quot; it &quot;contains a bunch of solid laughs.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There are loads of familiarly funny gags in the film ... But the movie is so sour that its humor is often undermined, because so many of the jokes are either mean-spirited or scatological, or both.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was positive and wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s an all-out assault on taste and taboo, and it made me laugh a lot.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a disappointingly uneven farce which serves up a fair share of hearty laughs during its first half, but sputters out long before the close.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Presumably everyone was so busy doing shtick and reacting off each other that there was no one left to mind the story and to say, &#x27;Not funny.&#x27; Not only not funny, but a big, overblown, crashing bore, fellas.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an entertaining mishmash of skits which finds Mel Brooks back in lively form, for better and for worse ... To a considerable extent the funny stuff works in a laughing-in-spite-of-yourself way.&quot; Leonard Maltin&#x27;s film guide gave the movie one-and-a-half out of a possible four stars and stated that the gags &quot;range from hilarious to hideous. After a while there&#x27;s no more momentum, and it all just lies there, despite the efforts of a large comic cast.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened in 484 theatres the same weekend as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; and finished fourth for the weekend with a gross of $4.8 million, behind &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;Clash&quot; and &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Nice Dreams&quot;. With a per-screen average of $10,000, it was Brooks&#x27;s highest opening on a per-screen basis. Despite the strong start, poor word of mouth impacted its box office. Although it grossed $31.7 million, it was considered a commercial disappointment because the film had been &quot;tracking&quot; well and Brooks&#x27;s previous films had been so successful.

===Home media===
&quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; was released on DVD. According to the MPAA, it was rated &quot;R&quot; for &quot;crude sexual humor, language, comic violence, sex and nudity, and drug use&quot;. In May 2010, it was released on Blu-ray.

==Sequel series==

On October 18, 2021, Hulu and Searchlight Television (the TV division of 20th Century&#x27;s sister studio, Searchlight Pictures) announced that a sequel variety series, called &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot; was in the works, with production beginning in spring 2022. Mel Brooks produced and wrote the series along with Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz, and Nick Kroll, who also star. It premiered on March 6, 2023.
