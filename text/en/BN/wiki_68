<text>The Westland Wasp is a small 1960s British turbine-powered, shipboard anti-submarine helicopter. Produced by Westland Helicopters, it came from the same Saunders-Roe P.531 programme as the British Army Westland Scout, and is based on the earlier piston-engined Saunders-Roe Skeeter. It fulfilled the requirement of the Royal Navy for a helicopter small enough to land on the deck of a frigate and carry a useful load of two homing torpedoes.

==Design and development==
The increasing speed and attack range of the submarine threat, and the increased range at which this threat could be detected, led to a Royal Navy requirement for a &quot;Manned Torpedo-Carrying Helicopter&quot; (MATCH). Contemporary shipboard weapons did not have the necessary range, therefore MATCH was in essence a stand-off weapon with the helicopter carrying the torpedo or other weapon to the target and being instructed when and where to drop it. Unlike the larger Westland Wessex, the Wasp carried no sonar of its own, and was limited strictly to working in partnership with its parent ship, other ships or other anti-submarine warfare (ASW) units.
The first prototype Saro P.531 flew on 20 July 1958, with the prototypes being subject to detailed testing by the Royal Navy, including the evaluation of several undercarriage layouts, before settling on the definitive arrangement. An order for a pre-production batch of two &quot;Sea Scouts&quot; was placed in September 1961. The first flight of the two pre-production Wasp took place on 28 October 1962. Full production soon commenced, 98 in total being procured for the RN. The Wasp was successfully exported to Brazil, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Africa. 133 aircraft were built in total.

Wasp was essentially a navalised Scout, indeed it was originally to be called the &quot;Sea Scout&quot;, and differed mainly in design details. It had a unique 4-wheeled castering undercarriage that allowed the aircraft to be manoeuvred on small, pitching flightdecks. The Wasp could use &quot;negative pitch&quot; from the rotor-blades to enable the aircraft to &quot;adhere&quot; to the deck until the lashings were attached. Additional fuel tankage was installed in the cabin floor, and both the tail boom and main rotor blades were foldable to allow stowage in the small hangars fitted to the first generation helicopter-carrying escorts. It was fitted with a winch above the starboard rear door, and also had the capacity to carry underslung loads from the semi-automatic cargo release unit mounted under the fuselage. With a crew of two (Pilot and Missile Aimer/Aircrewman) and the capacity to seat three passengers, Wasp was useful for short-range transport missions, and for casualty evacuation with room for one stretcher fitted across the rear cabin area.

Later modifications included the ability to carry the Nord SS.11 wire-guided missile, with the fitting of the Aimer&#x27;s sight in the left cockpit roof, and the installation of large inflatable emergency floats in sponsons on either side of the cabin to prevent capsizing of the top-heavy aircraft in the event of ditching. The SS.11 had limited range, targeting small surface targets such as patrol boats or shore positions, and was later replaced by the AS.12, which effectively had double the range.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===

The Wasp HAS.1 was introduced to service in the small ships role in 1964, after an intensive period of trials by 700(W) Intensive Flying Trials Unit between June 1963 and March 1964. It served in this primary role with 829 Naval Air Squadron, but also in training units to supply crews for the front line with 706 NAS between 1965 and 1967 and in 703 NAS between 1972 and 1981. Single airframes also served for light liaison duties in the Commando Assault squadrons, 845 NAS and 848 NAS, until 1973. Although effective as a submarine killer, it was best deployed paired with a Wessex HAS.3 submarine hunter. In the late 1970s, the Westland Lynx started to replace the Wasp.

On 25 April 1982 the Argentinian submarine was spotted by a Wessex helicopter from . The Wessex and a Lynx HAS.2 from then attacked it with depth charges, a Mk 46 torpedo, and also strafed it with General Purpose Machine Gun. A Wasp launched from and two Wasps launched from fired AS.12 anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty on South Georgia and surrendered to the British forces, thus becoming the first casualty of the sea war, as well as the first direct engagement by the Royal Navy Task Force.

The last Wasp was withdrawn from service in 1988 when the last of the Type 12 frigates was decommissioned.

===Royal Malaysian Navy===
The Wasp came into service with the Royal Malaysian Navy quite late, compared to the other nations who procured the aircraft when it joined the RMN on 8 April 1988. The Wasp had a relatively short career and was phased out ten years later, replaced by the Eurocopter Fennec.

===Royal New Zealand Navy===
The first four of an eventual nineteen Wasps were purchased by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) in 1966, being immediately assigned to the new frigate, . They fulfilled numerous tasks, as well as taking part in the Armilla Patrol in the Persian Gulf during the 1980s. The Wasps were flown by RNZN pilots but maintained by ground crews of No. 3 Squadron RNZAF.

In 1997, four Wasps performed a flypast marking the arrival of the new frigate, HMNZS &quot;Te Kaha&quot;.

The Wasp served 32 years with the RNZN, retiring in 1998, the same year HMNZS &quot;Waikato&quot;, which first operationally deployed the Wasp in New Zealand, was herself decommissioned. They were replaced by the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite as a stopgap until the arrival of their SH-2G(NZ).

===Royal Netherlands Navy===
With the Royal Netherlands Navy beginning in the late 1960s, after the fire onboard , NATO anti-submarine commitments were taken over by a squadron of Westland Wasp helicopters, operated from six anti-submarine frigates. The shore base was at De Kooy Airfield. The Royal Netherlands Navy 860 Naval Air Squadron received 12 Wasp helicopters between November 1966 and June 1967, operated from &quot;Van Speijk&quot;-class frigates as AH-12As and flown in the ASW role. The last of the Dutch Wasps were withdrawn from service in 1981 when they were replaced by the Westland Lynx.

===Other operators===
The Wasp was also in service with the Brazilian, Indonesian, and South African navies. The Indonesian aircraft were all former Dutch aircraft and the last of the type in active service.

The last of the ten surplus Dutch Navy helicopters refurbished by Westland for the Indonesian Navy was grounded in 1998. Flown by 400th Air Squadron (RON 400) from NAS Juanda, when at sea they were embarked upon the Indonesian Navy&#x27;s ex-Royal Navy and ex-Dutch Navy &quot;Van Speijk&quot; class frigates.

The Brazilian Navy operated the Wasp as the UH-2 &amp; UH-2A, taking delivery of three new build helicopters in April 1966 and a further seven ex-Royal Navy helicopters in 1977. 1º &quot;Esquadrão de Helicópteros de Emprego Geral&quot; (HU-1) flew the helicopters from Navy&#x27;s and -class destroyers and the s.

The South African Navy received their first batch of ten new-build airframes in 1963, followed by the delivery of a second batch of eight from 1973. Only six of this batch were delivered due to the international arms embargo placed on South Africa during the apartheid regime. The Wasps were flown by 22 Flight from Ysterplaat; the unit became 22 Squadron, Maritime Command in 1976. The helicopters were operated from the navy&#x27;s frigates. The South African Navy also acquired one ex-Bahrain Public Security Force airframe as an instructional airframe to support its Wasp programme. The South African Navy withdrew their last Wasp in 1990.

<text>The United Holy Church of America (UHCA) is the oldest African-American Holiness-Pentecostal body in the world. It was established in 1886, with the international headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina. The UHCA consists of an estimated 516 churches, 17 districts, and 8 territories. The largest and the oldest district of the connectional body is the Southern District Convocation (Goldsboro, North Carolina).

== Districts ==
The United Holy Church of America, is divided into 17 separate districts, with 4 districts being established for international jurisdiction.

== Divisions and reunion ==
In 1977, the church divided when the Southern District Convocation, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, withdrew from fellowship with the parent body. However, in May 2000 in the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, the Southern District Convocation was reunited with the connectional body.

Mount Calvary Holy Church of America split from the United Holy Church in 1929 to form their own Holiness-Pentecostal body. Mount Sinai Holy Church of America separated from the mother church in 1924 to form an organization to create gender equality in episcopal ordination.

<text>A troupe system is a way of playing role-playing games in which a group of players takes different roles at different times. The term was coined in Ars Magica, where it referred to each player using multiple characters and, crucially, sharing a pool of characters held in common by the entire group (referred to as the &quot;troupe&quot;).

==Troupe play in Ars Magica==

In &quot;Ars Magica&quot;, the troupe&#x27;s characters all belong to a single Covenant - a small group dedicated to the study and utilization of the magical arts. Each player&#x27;s primary character is their Magus, one of the wizards who form the core of the Covenant. Each player also creates a Companion, a &quot;skilled person who aids magi but is not necessarily in their pay.&quot; Finally the group (or troupe) as a whole creates a number of Grogs, mercenaries and other servants hired by the magi.

A typical session of &quot;Ars Magica&quot; features one player running their Magus while the other players take on the role of either a Companion or Grog. The Grogs are a communal asset, and, thus, over the course of several sessions the same grog may be played by several different players.

The &quot;Ars Magica&quot; rulebooks also provide for a single player taking on &quot;secondary roles&quot; and playing multiple characters simultaneously (a Magus and their Companion, for example, or multiple Grogs). It is also noted that, &quot;since players switch characters, it is easy to switch storyguides from story to story as well.&quot; neither of these features, however, is considered the primary defining trait of &quot;troupe-style play&quot;, although they are common features in many &quot;Ars Magica&quot; campaigns.

==Other examples of troupe play==

Troupe-style play can also be found in other role-playing games, such as &quot;Circle of Hands&quot;, (which actually prohibits any player from playing the same character two sessions in a row), and &quot;Shock: Human Contact&quot;, a science fiction game which starts with a session on a research ship, then a session on a colony, and then additional sessions where characters can be selected from either location.

<text>Edward Koiki Mabo ( ; Sambo) (29 June 1936 – 21 January 1992) was an Indigenous Australian man from the Torres Strait Islands known for his role in campaigning for Indigenous land rights in Australia, in particular the landmark decision of the High Court of Australia that recognised that indigenous rights to land had continued after the British Crown acquired sovereignty and that the international law doctrine of terra nullius was not applicable to Australian domestic law. High court judges considering the case &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; found in favour of Mabo, which led to the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; and established native title in Australia, officially recognising the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia.

== Early life and family ==
Eddie Mabo was born Edward Koiki Sambo on 29 June 1936 in the village of Las located on the island of Mer in the Torres Strait. His parents were Robert Zesou Sambo and Poipe Mabo, but Eddie was adopted by his uncle Benny Mabo when his mother died shortly after he was born. This adoption was part of traditional Torres Strait Islander adoption practices.

When young, Mabo was influenced by his teacher Robert &#x27;Bob&#x27; Victor Miles, a relieving teacher with the Schools for Islanders. Miles was known as a friend of all his students; he not only taught the children of the islands but also learnt their language and encouraged them to use their own language in class. Mabo was one of these students and learnt more than just language from Miles, he also gained an understanding of &#x27;mainland&#x27; culture. Mabo, who lived with Miles for a time while his mother was ill, later reflected on the importance of his education. That, along with his confident use of language, self-assured public speaking and understanding of mainland politics, culminated in the landmark case &quot;Mabo v Queensland&quot; in 1992.

Eddie had a great bond with his tradition. He enjoyed activities such as Aboriginal painting, dancing and singing. But his uncle and aunt, Benny and Maigo Mabo, taught him to respect other&#x27;s cultures as well.

Mabo married Bonita Neehow, an Australian South Sea Islander, in 1959. The couple had seven children and adopted three more. Bonita Mabo died in Townsville on 26 November 2018, aged 75, just days after receiving an honorary doctorate of letters from James Cook University for her contributions to Indigenous rights and human rights.

One daughter, Gail Mabo (born 1966), is a successful visual artist who has had her work exhibited across Australia. Before beginning her studies in art in the 2000s, she had a career in dance, choreography, and acting. She has also worked with schools in New South Wales as a cultural advisor, and has served as the family&#x27;s designated spokesperson.

Mabo&#x27;s nephew was Anglican Bishop Saibo Mabo.

His great-nephew is NBA athlete Patty Mills, the third Indigenous Australian to represent the nation in Olympic basketball.

==Career==
Mabo worked on pearling boats, as a cane cutter, and as a railway fettler (worker), becoming a gardener at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland at age 31.

In 1973, Eddie and Bonita Mabo established the Black Community School in Townsville, where Torres Strait Islander children could learn their own culture rather than European culture.

Speaking to the State Library of Queensland for their podcast series about the Mabo decision, Eddie&#x27;s daughter Gail Mabo recalled that her father particularly objected to Torres Strait Islander children being taught a version of history that did not include any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander voices or perspectives. She also said that Eddie Mabo believed that knowledge of their culture would give Torres Strait children growing up on the mainland a solid foundation and a sense of pride.

Noel Zaro attended the Black Community School, also known as BCS. He remembered that on a standard day, the school taught Western subjects such as English and Maths in the morning: after lunch, students would be taught about Torres Strait Islander culture, including basic Meriam language vocabulary as well as traditional dancing. Some students, including Noel Zaro, took field trips to other schools for traditional dance demonstrations, often transported by parents or family members.

As the school was not sanctioned by the Queensland education board, Eddie Mabo served unpaid as principal, cultural instructor and school bus driver. He continued to work as a gardener at James Cook University in the evenings.

The time Mabo spent on the James Cook University campus had a massive impact on his life. In 1974, he was talking with James Cook University historians Noel Loos and Henry Reynolds, and Loos recalls:
[W]e were having lunch one day in Reynolds&#x27; office when Koiki was just speaking about his land back on Mer, or Murray Island. Henry and I realised that in his mind he thought he owned that land, so we sort of glanced at each other, and then had the difficult responsibility of telling him that he didn&#x27;t own that land, and that it was Crown land. Koiki was surprised, shocked and even ... he said and I remember him saying &#x27;No way, it&#x27;s not theirs, it&#x27;s ours.&#x27;
Later, when Mabo was a research assistant on an oral history project in the Torres Strait, Reynolds records:

He got as far as Thursday Island and no further. He was refused permission to land on any of the other islands in the Straits. A reputation as a radical was a heavy burden in Queensland at the time. For Eddie the rejection was devastating. He could not go home. He was not only landless in the eyes of white man&#x27;s law, he was an exile as well.
==Land rights advocate==

In 1981 a land rights conference was held at James Cook University and Mabo gave a speech in which he explained the land inheritance system on Murray Island. The significance of this in terms of Australian common law doctrine was noted by one of the attendees, a lawyer, who suggested there should be a test case to claim land rights through the court system. Perth-based solicitor Greg McIntyre was at the conference and agreed to take the case; he then recruited barristers Ron Castan and Bryan Keon-Cohen. McIntyre represented Mabo during the hearings.

Of the eventual outcome of that decision a decade later, Reynolds said: &quot;it was a ten-year battle and it was a remarkable saga really&quot;.

==Death and Mabo decision==

On 21 January 1992, Eddie Mabo died of cancer at the age of 55.

Five months later, on 3 June 1992, the High Court announced its historic decision to recognise the land rights of Indigenous Australians. That decision, formally &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot;, now commonly called &quot;Mabo&quot; in Australia, is recognised for its landmark status.

Three years after Mabo died, that being the traditional mourning period for the people of Murray Island, a memorial service was held. The next day, Mabo&#x27;s gravesite was attacked by vandals who spray-painted swastikas and racial slurs on his tombstone as well as removing a bronze bas-relief portrait of him. His family decided to have his body reburied on Murray Island. On the night of his reinterment, the Islanders performed their traditional ceremony for the burial of a Meriam king, a ritual not seen on the island for 80 years.

== Legacy ==

In 1992, Edward Koiki Mabo was posthumously awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Awards, together with the Reverend Dave Passi, Sam Passi (deceased), James Rice (deceased), Celuia Mapo Salee (deceased) and Barbara Hocking (deceased). The award was in recognition &quot;of their long and determined battle to gain justice for their people&quot; and the &quot;work over many years to gain legal recognition for indigenous people&#x27;s rights&quot;.

In 1993, &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper commemorated his work by voting him the 1992 Australian of the Year (not to be confused with the official Australian of the Year awards issued by the Australian Government).

A documentary film, &quot;&quot;, directed by Trevor Graham, was released in 1997 and received the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Documentary.

The Eddie Koiki Mabo Lecture Series was established in his honour in 2004 at James Cook University. The lectures have been given by eminent Australians on Mabo Day, which takes place every year on 3 June, in National Reconciliation Week, in most years since then.

On 21 May 2008, James Cook University named its Townsville campus library the Eddie Koiki Mabo Library.

Mabo Day is an official holiday in the Torres Shire, celebrated on 3 June, and occurs during National Reconciliation Week in Australia.

On 10 June 2012, &quot;Mabo&quot;, a television film based on Mabo&#x27;s life, was broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

In June 2014, the annual Eddie Mabo Award for Social Justice was created as one of three awards at the newly-established National Indigenous Human Rights Awards in Sydney, New South Wales.

On 3 June 2015, on the 23rd anniversary of the Mabo decision, a star was named Koiki after Eddie Koiki Mabo. It was named by Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, with the naming ceremony taking place at Sydney Observatory. The star is within the Southern Cross constellation as well as the huge Torres Strait Islanders&#x27; constellation known as Tagai, which is very culturally significant and used for nautical navigation.

On 24 August 2015, Tony Abbott became the first Prime Minister of Australia to visit Mabo&#x27;s grave on Murray Island, where he paid tribute to his legacy.

In 2016, Google Doodle commemorated his 80th birthday.

In 2017, the Royal Australian Mint issued a 50-cent coin commemorating 25 years since Mabo&#x27;s death and the legal decision and 50 years since the referendum. It was designed by his granddaughter Boneta-Marie Mabo and released in National Reconciliation Week.

In 2022, the State Library of Queensland produced a podcast called &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Eddie&quot;. Hosted by Rhianna Patrick, the podcast discusses the Mabo&#x27;s life, the High Court case, and the enduring legacy of both.

The State Library of Queensland holds several significant collections relating to the Mabo decision and the Mabo family, including:

* OM95-26 Mabo Cutting Books - these books contain newspaper clippings relating to the Mabo case between November 1990 and October 1994

In Lakeland, Verschuur was also the President of the Garner Lake Association. Since 1986 he has been married to Dr. Joan Schmelz, a fellow scientist whose specialty is solar astronomy, specifically coronal loops. Verschuur has one son who lives in England.

During his years living beside the lake in Lakeland he made a fundamental discovery concerning the manner in which light interacts with a so-called Secchi Disk that is used to measure the transparency of lake and ocean waters. The disk had been invented in the mid-nineteenth century by a Jesuit priest (Angela Secchi) but no one before Verschuur had understand the optics underlying the measurement technique. 

Verschuur has taught at the University of Manchester, Rhodes University, the universities of Colorado and Maryland, UCLA, and the University of California, Berkeley, among others. He has been an annual speaker at Mid-South Stargaze, &quot;the annual amateur astronomers conference and star party held at Rainwater Observatory in French Camp, Mississippi.&quot; In 1971 Verschuur was hired as the first Director of Fiske Planetarium for the University of Colorado at Boulder, and in 1980 he worked with Dr. John C. Lilly.

In his primary field of study Verschuur &quot;pioneered the measurement of the interstellar magnetic field using the 21-cm Zeeman effect technique.&quot; A thing which, according to Virginia Trimble, for the first time allowed astronomers to &quot;measure magnetic strengths and their place-to-place variations with some confidence.&quot;

==Biography==

Gerrit L. Verschuur was born in 1937 in Cape Town, South Africa, at the foot of Table Mountain. In 1936, his parents had emigrated from the Netherlands and settled in Cape Town. Two years after he was born—in 1939—his parents moved again, choosing a suburb of Cape Town named Lakeside. While he was living there, Verschuur attended Muizenberg Junior School. Then, when his parents moved to Port Elizabeth in 1950, he attended Grey Junior and subsequently Grey High School.

After graduation he began a six-year stint at Rhodes University in Grahamstown where he earned a BSc in 1957—Majors: Math, Physics, &amp; Applied math; a BSc (Hons) of Physics in 1958; and a MSc degree of physics, in 1960.

In December 1960 he sailed for Southampton, England on Edinburgh Castle, a ship owned by the Union Castle Line. It was one of the last passenger mail boats to ply the SA-England route, but was sold for scrap in 1967.

==Current research==

Verschuur is at the center of a recent debate over the age of the universe. He claimed that images from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe are not pictures of the universe in its early form, but rather hydrogen gas clouds in our own galaxy. If he is shown to be correct, much work relating to the Big Bang theory would be undermined.

On December 10, 2007, his work with respect to COBE, WMAP, and HI, was published in The Astrophysical Journal. However, Land and Slosar claimed that the data did not support the correlation claimed by Verschuur. He subsequently published 4 more papers on the subject backing up his claims.

His current research is conducted in partnership with Joan Schmelz, his wife, and elaborates on the exciting discovery they made that the so-called high-velocity clouds are produced by supernova events that occurred relatively close to the Sun, of order hundreds of light years distant, several hundred thousand years ago. They solved the 60 year-old mystery concerning the distance to certain clouds when they found that neutron stars (left over after the explosion) exists in spectroscopic binary systems, the primary example having been discovered by researchers in Belgium led by Ana Escorza who used GAIA data to identify likely neutron star candidates.

<text>Asia Argento (; born Aria Maria Vittoria Rossa Argento; 20 September 1975) is an Italian actress and filmmaker. The daughter of filmmaker Dario Argento, she has had roles in several of her father&#x27;s features and achieved mainstream success with appearances in &quot;XXX&quot; (2002), &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; (2005) and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006). Her other notable acting credits include &quot;Queen Margot&quot; (1994), &quot;Let&#x27;s Not Keep in Touch&quot; (1994), &quot;Traveling Companion&quot; (1996), &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005) and &quot;Islands&quot; (2011). Argento is the recipient of several accolades, including two David di Donatello awards for Best Actress and three Italian Golden Globes. Her directorial credits include &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; (2004) and &quot;Misunderstood&quot; (2014).

After the Weinstein scandal in 2017, she became a leading advocate in the &quot;#MeToo&quot; movement. In August 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailed allegations that Argento sexually assaulted actor Jimmy Bennett in 2013, when he was 17 and she was 37.

==Early life==

Asia Argento was born Aria Maria Vittoria Rossa Argento in Rome on 20 September 1975. Her father is Dario Argento, an Italian filmmaker known for his work in the Italian giallo genre and for his influence on modern horror and slasher movies. Her mother was actress Daria Nicolodi and her maternal great-grandfather was composer Alfredo Casella.

When Argento was born, the city registry office in Rome refused to acknowledge &quot;Asia&quot; as an appropriate name, and instead officially inscribed her name as &quot;Aria&quot; (a name accepted by the city registry). She went by the name Asia, which she later used professionally. She pronounces her name as &quot;AH-she-ah&quot;, which friends sometimes abbreviate to sound like &quot;Ozzie&quot;. Argento has said that as a child she was lonely and depressed, owing in part to her parents&#x27; work. Her father used to read her his horror scripts as bedtime stories. At age eight, Argento published a book of poems. At the age of 14, she ran away from home.

Argento has mentioned in interviews that she does not have a close relationship with her father. She has mentioned that he was absent when she was a child, and has also mentioned that, because of this, she did not have a happy childhood. Regarding her relationship with her father and her reason for acting, she has stated that:

In an interview with &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine, she stated that, at one time, &quot;I was sick for a while; I was agoraphobic. I was afraid to go out of my apartment for a long time, I could only go out to work.&quot;

==Career==
Asia Argento began to act at the age of nine, when she was cast in a small role in a film by Sergio Citti. When she was 16, she starred in her father&#x27;s film &quot;Trauma&quot; (1993). She received the David di Donatello (Italy&#x27;s version of the Academy Award) for Best Actress in 1994 for her performance in &quot;Perdiamoci di vista&quot;, and again in 1996 for &quot;Compagna di viaggio&quot;, which also earned her a Grolla d&#x27;oro award. Argento subsequently began to appear in English-language movies, such as &quot;B. Monkey&quot; and &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; (both 1998). Argento also performed in French-language roles, beginning with Charlotte de Sauve in &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; (1994).

Around the same time, she made her first foray into directing with the short films &quot;Prospettive&quot; and &quot;A ritroso&quot; (both 1994) and a documentary about her father (in 1996) and Abel Ferrara (in 1998). In 2000, Argento directed and wrote her first fiction feature film, &quot;Scarlet Diva&quot; (2000), which her father co-produced. In a review, &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine called the film &quot;riotously funny&quot; and dubbed Argento &quot;a filmmaker with a great degree of promise&quot;.

She achieved wider recognition when she portrayed Russian undercover spy Yelena in the Hollywood action film &quot;XXX&quot; (2002), alongside Vin Diesel. The film grossed $277.4 million and launched Argento to international fame. She directed her second feature film, &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; (2004), based on a book by JT LeRoy.

In addition to her cinematic accomplishments, Argento has written a number of stories for magazines such as &quot;Dynamo&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;, while her first novel, titled &quot;I Love You Kirk&quot;, was published in Italy in 1999. She has modeled for the denim jeans brand Miss Sixty. She became a fan of the band Hondo Maclean when they wrote a track named after her and liked the track so much that she sent them pictures which they used as the cover of their 2003 album &quot;Plans for a Better Day&quot;.

She appeared in Placebo&#x27;s music video for &quot;This Picture&quot;, and appeared on Placebo frontman Brian Molko&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot;. Argento has also starred in Catherine Breillat&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Last Mistress&quot;. She dubbed the Italian version of the video game &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot; in the role of the runner Faith Connors, from 2008 to 2009.

Argento has been part of the Legendary Tiger Man&#x27;s project &quot;Femina&quot;, which was released on 14 September 2009. She is featured on the song &quot;Life Ain&#x27;t Enough for You&quot;, which was released as a single along with the B-side &quot;My stomach is the most violent of all Italy&quot;, in which she also contributes vocals.

In May 2013, Argento&#x27;s debut album, entitled &quot;Total Entropy&quot;, was released by Nuun Music.

In 2014, Argento played supporting role in the British film &quot;Shongram&quot;, a fictional romantic drama based around the factual and historical events of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.

Also in 2014, she directed her third feature film, titled &quot;Misunderstood&quot; (2014), was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard section at that year&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival. That year, while promoting the film, Argento stated that she was not going to act anymore and that she had decided to concentrate on writing and directing.

==Personal life==

Besides Italian, Argento speaks English and French, which she learned for her role in &quot;Les Morsures de L&#x27;Aube&quot;.

In 2009, Argento signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. In 2017, she expressed regret for signing the petition, calling it &quot;a mistake&quot; and stating later on that Polanski&#x27;s continued career &quot;speaks terribly of the industry&quot;.

Argento moved to Germany in 2017, citing experiences of victim blaming received in Italy following her allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

=== Relationships ===
Her first child, Anna Lou Castoldi, was born in 2001. Italian rock and roll musician Morgan (lead singer of Bluvertigo), is the father. She named her daughter after her half-sister Anna Ceroli, who died in a motorcycle accident.

Argento married film director Michele Civetta on 27 August 2008 in Arezzo. Her second child (a son) was born in 2008 in Rome. The couple divorced in 2013. She and her children live in the Vigna Clara neighborhood of Rome.

Argento worked and became romantically involved with Anthony Bourdain in 2016 during the production of the Rome episode of &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;. Bourdain became outspoken alongside Argento during her allegations against Harvey Weinstein for a time after those events.

=== Sexual assault allegations by Argento ===

Argento alleged in an October 2017 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article by Ronan Farrow that she had been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein in the 1990s. She would later have consensual albeit &quot;one-sided&quot; sexual relations with him. She confirmed that a scene in &quot;Scarlet Diva&quot; where her character is accosted by a movie executive was indeed a reference to Weinstein. Later, Argento stated that the &quot;article did a huge disservice to me and to my truth by simplifying all this&quot;, and accused Farrow of &quot;misrepresenting&quot; what happened to her.

Argento delivered a speech on 20 May 2018, following the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, calling the festival Weinstein&#x27;s &quot;hunting ground&quot;, alleging that she was raped by Weinstein in Cannes when she was 21. She added, &quot;And even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women&quot;.

On 24 January 2021, Argento alleged that director Rob Cohen had drugged her with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and raped her during the filming of &quot;xXx&quot;. A representative of Cohen denied Argento&#x27;s assault accusation as &quot;absolutely false&quot;.

===Sexual assault allegation against Argento===
On 19 August 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published allegations that Argento sexually assaulted actor Jimmy Bennett. Argento had first met Bennett when he played her son in the 2004 film &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; when Bennett was seven years old. The alleged assault occurred in 2013 when he was two months past his 17th birthday in a hotel room in California, where the age of consent is 18; Argento was 37 at the time. According to Bennett, in their encounter Argento gave him alcohol, performed oral sex on him and had sexual intercourse with him. If true, this would have been deemed statutory rape as Bennett was legally a minor under California law. 

Argento quietly arranged a $380,000 nondisclosure settlement with Bennett in the months following her revelations regarding Weinstein. Bennett said when Argento came out against Weinstein, it stirred memories of his own experience in 2013. He imparted that he had sought to resolve the matter privately, and had not spoken out sooner &quot;because I was ashamed and afraid to be part of the public narrative&quot;. 

In a statement provided to the &quot;Times&quot;, he said: &quot;I was underage when the event took place, and I tried to seek justice in a way that made sense to me at the time because I was not ready to deal with the ramifications of my story becoming public. At the time I believed there was still a stigma to being in the situation as a male in our society. I didn&#x27;t think that people would understand the event that took place from the eyes of a teenage boy.&quot; Bennett said he would like to &quot;move past this event in my life&quot;, adding, &quot;today I choose to move forward, no longer in silence&quot;.

Argento denied the allegations, claiming that she never had a sexual encounter with Bennett and that when he made a request for money to her, her partner Anthony Bourdain paid him to avoid negative publicity. 

On 22 August, she released a statement reading: &quot;I strongly deny and oppose the contents of the &quot;New York Times&quot; article dated 20 August 2018, as circulated also in national and international news. I am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false. I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.&quot; A spokeswoman for the &quot;Times&quot; responded, &quot;We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting, which was based on verified documents and multiple sources&quot;. Fellow #MeToo advocate Rose McGowan initially expressed support for Argento and implored others to show restraint, stating, &quot;None of us know the truth of the situation and I&#x27;m sure more will be revealed. Be gentle.&quot; McGowan faced criticism on social media for her comments, which contradicted the #MeToo movement&#x27;s message of believing survivors. 

Following Argento&#x27;s denials, a photograph of her topless in bed with Bennett was published, as well as her alleged admission of sex with him in text messages to model Rain Dove. In the screenshots, Argento reputedly stated: &quot;I had sex with him it felt weird. I didn&#x27;t know he was a minor until the shakedown letter.&quot; 

In a letter published online in September 2018, Argento&#x27;s attorney admitted there was a sexual encounter, but claimed Bennett &quot;sexually attacked&quot; Argento. Amid the allegations, Argento was dropped as a judge on &quot;X-Factor Italy&quot;.

<text>Optical mark recognition (OMR) collects data from people by identifying markings on a paper. 
OMR enables the hourly processing of hundreds or even thousands of documents. A common application of this technology is used in exams, where students mark cells as their answers. This allows for very fast automated grading of exam sheets.

==Background==
Many OMR devices have a scanner that shines a light onto a form. The device then looks at the contrasting reflectivity of the light at certain positions on the form. It will detect the black marks because they reflect less light than the blank areas on the form.

Some OMR devices use forms that are printed on transoptic paper. The device can then measure the amount of light that passes through the paper. It will pick up any black marks on either side of the paper because they reduce the amount of light passing through.

In contrast to the dedicated OMR device, desktop OMR software allows a user to create their own forms in a word processor or computer and print them on a laser printer. The OMR software then works with a common desktop image scanner with a document feeder to process the forms once filled out.

OMR is generally distinguished from optical character recognition (OCR) by the fact that a complicated pattern recognition engine is not required. That is, the marks are constructed in such a way that there is little chance that the OMR device will not read them correctly. This does require the image to have high contrast and an easily recognizable or irrelevant shape. A related field to OMR and OCR is the recognition of barcodes, such as the UPC bar code found on product packaging.

One of the most familiar applications of OMR is the use of #2 pencil (HB in Europe) bubble optical answer sheets in multiple choice question examinations. Students mark their answers, or other personal information, by darkening circles on a forms. The sheet is then graded by a scanning machine. 

* In the United States and most European countries, a horizontal or vertical &quot;tick&quot; in a rectangular &quot;lozenge&quot; is the most commonly used type of OMR form; 
* The most familiar form in the United Kingdom is the UK National lottery form. 

Lozenge marks represent a later technology that is easier to mark and easier to erase. The large &quot;bubble&quot; marks are legacy technology from very early OMR machines that were so insensitive a large mark was required for reliability. In most Asian countries, a special marker is used to fill in an optical answer sheet. Students, likewise, mark answers or other information by darkening circles marked on a pre-printed sheet. Then the sheet is automatically graded by a scanning machine.

Many of today&#x27;s OMR applications involve people filling in specialized forms. These forms are optimized for computer scanning, with careful registration in the printing, and careful design so that ambiguity is reduced to the minimum possible. Due to its extremely low error rate, low cost and ease-of-use, OMR is a popular method of tallying votes.

OMR marks are also added to items of printed mail so folder inserter equipment can be used. The marks are added to each (normally facing/odd) page of a mail document and consist of a sequence of black dashes that folder inserter equipment scans in order to determine when the mail should be folded then inserted in an envelope.

===Optical answer sheet===

An optical answer sheet or bubble sheet is a special type of form used in multiple choice question examinations. OMR is used to detect answers. The Scantron Corporation creates many optical answer sheets, although certain uses require their own customized system. 

Optical answer sheets usually have a set of blank ovals or boxes that correspond to each question, often on separate sheets of paper. Bar codes may mark the sheet for automatic processing, and each series of ovals filled will return a certain value when read. In this way students&#x27; answers can be digitally recorded, or identity given.

===Reading===
The first optical answer sheets were read by shining a light through the sheet and measuring how much of the light was blocked using phototubes on the opposite side. As some phototubes are mostly sensitive to the blue end of the visible spectrum, blue pens could not be used, as blue inks reflect and transmit blue light. Because of this, number two pencils had to be used to fill in the bubbles—graphite is a very opaque substance which absorbs or reflects most of the light which hits it.

Modern optical answer sheets are read based on reflected light, measuring lightness and darkness. They do not need to be filled in with a number two pencil, though these are recommended over other types (this is due to the lighter marks made by higher-number pencils and the smudges from number 1 pencils). Black ink will be read, though many systems will ignore marks that are the same color the form is printed in. This also allows optical answer sheets to be double-sided because marks made on the opposite side will not interfere with reflectance readings as much as with opacity readings.

Most systems accommodate for human error in filling in ovals imprecisely—as long as they do not stray into the other ovals and the oval is almost filled, the scanner will detect it as filled in.
===Designing and printing===
There are specific dimensions of designing OMR sheets with 0.05 mm precision on scale. If the dimensions are not up to the precision scale, the accuracy of the OMR sheet may vary, so the sheet should be designed, printed and cut perfectly.
* Single Part – Sheets are printed on 105 gsm to 120 gsm paper on A4/Legal sheets.
* Double Part (Carbonless) – Two sheets are printed; one on 105 gsm paper and one on 60-70 gsm paper on A4 sheets. The bottom of the first sheet and the top of the second sheet are chemically treated so that the impression of the first sheet comes on the second sheet. 
* Three Part (Carbonless) – Three sheets are printed on one 105 gsm paper and the other two are printed on 60-70 gsm paper on A4 sheets. The bottom of the first sheet, the top and bottom of the second sheet, and the top of the third sheet are chemically treated so that the impression of the first sheet comes on the second and third sheets.

===Errors===
It is possible for optical answer sheets to be printed incorrectly, such that all ovals will be read as filled. This occurs if the outline of the ovals is too thick, or is irregular. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, this occurred with over 19,000 absentee ballots in the Georgia county of Gwinnett, and was discovered after around 10,000 had already been returned. The slight difference was not apparent to the naked eye, and was not detected until a test run was made in late October. This required all ballots to be transferred to correctly printed ones, by sequestered workers of the board of elections, under close observation by members of the Democratic and Republican (but not other) political parties, and county sheriff deputies. The transfer, by law, could not occur until election day (November 4).

==OMR software==

OMR software is a computer software application that makes OMR possible on a desktop computer by using an Image scanner to process surveys, tests, attendance sheets, checklists, and other plain-paper forms printed on a laser printer.

OMR software is used to capture data from OMR sheets. While data capturing scanning devices focus on many factors like thickness of paper dimensions of OMR sheet and the designing pattern.

===Commercial OMR software===

One of the first OMR software packages that used images from common image scanners was Remark Office OMR, made by Gravic, Inc. (originally named Principia Products, Inc.). Remark Office OMR 1.0 was released in 1991.

The need for OMR software originated because early optical mark recognition systems used dedicated scanners and special pre-printed forms with drop-out colors and registration marks. Such forms typically cost US$0.10 to $0.19 a page. In contrast, OMR software users design their own mark-sense forms with a word processor or built-in form editor, print them locally on a printer, and can save thousands of dollars on large numbers of forms.

Identifying optical marks within a form, such as for processing census forms, has been offered by many forms-processing (Batch Transaction Capture) companies since the late 1980s. Mostly this is based on a bitonal image and pixel count with minimum and maximum pixel counts to eliminate extraneous marks, such as those erased with a dirty eraser that when converted into a black-and-white image (bitonal) can look like a legitimate mark. So this method can cause problems when a user changes their mind, and so some products started to use grayscale to better identify the intent of the marker—internally scantron and NCS scanners used grayscale.

OMR software is also used for adding OMR marks to mail documents so they can be scanned by folder inserter equipment. An example of OMR software is Mail Markup from UK developer Funasset Limited. This software allows the user to configure and select an OMR sequence then apply the OMR marks to mail documents prior to printing.

==History==
Optical mark recognition (OMR) is the scanning of paper to detect the presence or absence of a mark in a predetermined position. Optical mark recognition has evolved from several other technologies. In the early 19th century and 20th century patents were given for machines that would aid the blind.

OMR is now used as an input device for data entry. Two early forms of OMR are paper tape and punch cards which use actual holes punched into the medium instead of pencil filled circles on the medium. Paper tape was used as early as 1857 as an input device for telegraph. Punch cards were created in 1890 and were used as input devices for computers. The use of punch cards declined greatly in the early 1970s with the introduction of personal computers. With modern OMR, where the presence of a pencil filled in bubble is recognized, the recognition is done via an optical scanner.

The first mark sense scanner was the IBM 805 Test Scoring Machine; this read marks by sensing the electrical conductivity of graphite pencil lead using pairs of wire brushes that scanned the page. In the 1930s, Richard Warren at IBM experimented with optical mark sense systems for test scoring, as documented in US Patents 2,150,256 (filed in 1932, granted in 1939) and 2,010,653 (filed in 1933, granted in 1935). The first successful optical mark-sense scanner was developed by Everett Franklin Lindquist as documented in US Patent 3,050,248 (filed in 1955, granted in 1962). Lindquist had developed numerous standardized educational tests, and needed a better test scoring machine than the then-standard IBM 805. The rights to Lindquist&#x27;s patents were held by the Measurement Research Center until 1968, when the University of Iowa sold the operation to Westinghouse Corporation.

During the same period, IBM also developed a successful optical mark-sense test-scoring machine, as documented in US Patent 2,944,734 (filed in 1957, granted in 1960). IBM commercialized this as the IBM 1230 Optical mark scoring reader in 1962. This and a variety of related machines allowed IBM to migrate a wide variety of applications developed for its mark sense machines to the new optical technology. These applications included a variety of inventory management and trouble reporting forms, most of which had the dimensions of a standard punched card.

While the other players in the educational testing arena focused on selling scanning services, Scantron Corporation, founded in 1972, had a different model; it would distribute inexpensive scanners to schools and make profits from selling the test forms. As a result, many people came to think of all mark-sense forms (whether optically sensed or not) as &quot;scantron&quot; forms.

In 1983, Westinghouse Learning Corporation was acquired by National Computer Systems (NCS). In 2000, NCS was acquired by Pearson Education, where the OMR technology formed the core of Pearson&#x27;s Data Management group. In February 2008, M&amp;F Worldwide purchased the Data Management group from Pearson; the group is now part of the Scantron brand.

OMR has been used in many situations as mentioned below. The use of OMR in inventory systems was a transition between punch cards and bar codes and is not used as much for this purpose. OMR is still used extensively for surveys and testing though.

==Usage==
The use of OMR is not limited to schools or data collection agencies; many businesses and health care agencies use OMR to streamline their data input processes and reduce input error. OMR, OCR, and ICR technologies all provide a means of data collection from paper forms. OMR may also be done using an OMR (discrete read head) scanner or an imaging scanner.

===Applications===

There are many other applications for OMR, for examples:
* In the process of institutional research
* Community surveys
* Consumer surveys
* Tests and assessments
* Evaluations and feedback
* Data compilation
* Product evaluation
* Time sheets and inventory counts
* Membership subscription forms
* Lotteries and voting
* Geocoding (e.g. postal codes)
* Mortgage loan, banking, and insurance applications

===Field types===
OMR has different fields to provide the format the questioner desires. These fields include:

*Multiple, where there are several options but only one is chosen. For example, the form might ask for one of the options ABCDE; 12345; completely disagree, disagree, indifferent, agree, completely agree; or similar.
*Grid: the bubbles or lines are set up in a grid format for the user to fill in a phone number, name, ID number and so on.
*Add, total the answers to a single value
*Boolean, answering yes or no to all that apply
*Binary, answering yes or no to only one
*Dotted lines fields, developed by Smartshoot OMR, allow border dropping like traditional color dropping.

===Capabilities/requirements===
In the past and presently, some OMR systems require special paper, special ink and a special input reader (Bergeron, 1998). This restricts the types of questions that can be asked and does not allow for much variability when the form is being input. Progress in OMR now allows users to create and print their own forms and use a scanner (preferably with a document feeder) to read the information. The user is able to arrange questions in a format that suits their needs while still being able to easily input the data. OMR systems approach one hundred percent accuracy and only take 5 milliseconds on average to recognize marks. Users can use squares, circles, ellipses and hexagons for the mark zone. The software can then be set to recognize filled in bubbles, crosses or check marks.

OMR can also be used for personal use. There are all-in-one printers in the market that will print the photos the user selects by filling in the bubbles for size and paper selection on an index sheet that has been printed. Once the sheet has been filled in, the individual places the sheet on the scanner to be scanned and the printer will print the photos according to the marks that were indicated.

===Disadvantages===
There are also some disadvantages and limitations to OMR. If the user wants to gather large amounts of text, then OMR complicates the data collection. There is also the possibility of missing data in the scanning process, and incorrectly or unnumbered pages can lead to their being scanned in the wrong order. Also, unless safeguards are in place, a page could be rescanned, providing duplicate data and skewing the data.

As a result of the widespread adoption and ease of use of OMR, standardized examinations can consist primarily of multiple-choice questions, changing the nature of what is being tested.

<text>The TI-83 series is a series of graphing calculators manufactured by Texas Instruments.

The original TI-83 is itself an upgraded version of the TI-82. Released in 1996, it was one of the most popular graphing calculators for students. In addition to the functions present on normal scientific calculators, the TI-83 includes many features, including function graphing, polar/parametric/sequence graphing modes, statistics, trigonometric, and algebraic functions, along with many useful applications. Although it does not include as many calculus functions, applications and programs can be written on the calculator or loaded from external sources.

The TI-83 was redesigned twice, first in 1999 and again in 2001. TI replaced the TI-83 with the &quot;TI-83 Plus&quot; in 1999. The 2001 redesign introduced a design very similar to the TI-73 and TI-83 Plus, eliminating the sloped screen that had been common on TI graphing calculators since the TI-81. Beginning with the 1999 release of the TI-83 Plus, it has included Flash memory, enabling the device&#x27;s operating system to be updated if needed, or for large new Flash Applications to be stored, accessible through a new Apps key. The Flash memory can also be used to store user programs and data. In 2001, the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition was released, which featured approximately nine times the available flash memory, and over twice the processing speed (15 MHz) of a standard TI-83 Plus, all in a translucent grey case inlaid with small &quot;sparkles&quot;. The 2001 redesign (nicknamed the TI-83 &quot;Parcus&quot;) introduced a slightly different shape to the calculator itself, eliminated the glossy grey screen border, and reduced cost by streamlining the printed circuit board to four units.

== Additional models ==

=== TI-83 Plus ===
The &quot;TI-83 Plus&quot; was designed in 1999 as an upgrade to the TI-83. The TI-83 Plus is one of TI&#x27;s most popular calculators. It uses a Zilog Z80 microprocessor running at 6 MHz, a 96×64 monochrome LCD screen, and 4 AAA batteries as well as backup CR1616 or CR1620 battery. A link port is also built into the calculator in the form of a 2.5 mm jack. The main improvement over the TI-83, however, is the addition of 512 KB of Flash ROM, which allows for operating system upgrades and applications to be installed. Most of the Flash memory is used by the operating system, with 160 KB available for user files and applications. Another development is the ability to install Flash Applications, which allows the user to add functionality to the calculator. Such applications have been made for math and science, text editing (both uppercase and lowercase letters), organizers and day planners, editing spread sheets, games, and many other uses.

Designed for use by high school and college students, though now used by middle school students in some public school systems, it contains all the features of a scientific calculator as well as function, parametric, polar, and sequential graphing capabilities; an environment for financial calculations; matrix operations; on-calculator programming; and more. Symbolic manipulation (differentiation, algebra) is not built into the TI-83 Plus. It can be programmed using a language called TI-BASIC, which is similar to the BASIC computer language. Programming may also be done in TI Assembly, made up of Z80 assembly and a collection of TI provided system calls. Assembly programs run much faster, but are more difficult to write. Thus, the writing of Assembly programs is often done on a computer.

=== TI-83 Plus Silver Edition ===
The &quot;TI-83 Plus Silver Edition&quot; was released in 2001. Its enhancements are 1.5 MB of flash memory, a dual-speed 6/15 MHz processor, 96 KB of additional RAM (but TI has yet to code support for the entire RAM into an OS), an improved link transfer hardware, a translucent silver case, and more applications preinstalled. This substantial Flash memory increase is significant. Whereas the TI-83+ can only hold a maximum of 10 apps (or more often less, dependent on size), the Silver Edition can hold up to 94 apps. It also includes a USB link cable in the box. It is almost completely compatible with the TI-83 Plus; the only problems that may arise are with programs (e.g. games) that may run too quickly on the Silver Edition or with some programs which have problems with the link hardware. The key layout is the same.

A second version of the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition exists, the ViewScreen (VSC) version. It is virtually identical, but has an additional port at the screen end of the rear of the unit, enabling displays on overhead projectors via a cable and panel. It looks similar to the standard TI-83 Plus, but has a silver-colored frame, identical to the standard Silver Edition, around the screen.

The TI-83 Plus Silver Edition is listed on the Texas Instruments website as &quot;discontinued.&quot;
In April 2004, the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition was replaced by the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition. They feature the same processor and the same amount of Flash memory, but the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition features a built-in USB port, clock, and changeable faceplates.

== Programming ==

The TI-83 Plus series are very similar in the languages natively supported by the calculator. These include &quot;TI-BASIC&quot;, an interpreted language used by all of TI&#x27;s calculators, and &quot;TI-ASM&quot;, an unofficial name for the native Z80 assembly language on which the calculator is based.

=== TI-BASIC ===
TI-BASIC is the built-in language for TI-83 series calculators, as well as many other TI graphing calculators. Due to its simplicity and the ubiquity of TI calculators in school curricula, for many students it is their first experience with programming. Below is an example of a hello world program equivalent to the assembly language example.
:ClrHome
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
=== Assembly language ===

The TI-83 was the first calculator in the TI series to have built-in assembly language support. The TI-92, TI-85, and TI-82 were capable of running assembly language programs, but only after sending a specially constructed (hacked) memory backup. The support on the TI-83 could be accessed through a hidden feature of the calculator. Users would write their assembly (ASM) program on their computer, assemble it, and send it to their calculator as a program. The user would then execute the command &quot;Send (9prgm&quot; (then the name/number of the program), and it would execute the program. Successors of the TI-83 replaced the Send() backdoor with a less-hidden Asm() command.

Z80 assembly language gives a programmer much more power over the calculator than the built-in language, TI-BASIC. On the downside, Z80 assembly is more difficult to learn than TI-BASIC. Z80 assembly language can be programmed on the computer and sent to the calculator via USB port, written by hand directly into the program editor (using the hexadecimal equivalents to the op-codes) or compiled using third party compiler programs. Programs written in assembly are much faster and more efficient than those using TI-BASIC, as it is the processor&#x27;s native language, and does not have to be interpreted.
An example program that displays &quot;Hello World!&quot; on the screen is given. Note that b_call() is not an instruction, but a macro (syntactic sugar) for calling an OS routine.
.nolist ; Standard header
#include &quot;ti83plus.inc&quot;
.list
.org userMem-2
.db t2ByteTok,tAsmCmp

Main:
 b_call(_ClrScrnFull) ; Clears the screen
 b_call(_HomeUp) ; Moves the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen
 ld hl,Hello ; Loads the address that points to &quot;Hello World&quot; into register hl (16-bit)
 b_call(_PutS) ; Displays &quot;Hello World&quot; on the screen
 ret ; Pops the last value pushed onto the stack into the program execution register
 ; May be used to end the program depending on what&#x27;s on the stack

Hello: ; Gives the label an equate address in memory
.db &quot;Hello World!&quot;,0 ; The hex values of &quot;Hello World&quot; are stored in program data

.end ; Marks the end of a file
.end ; Two .ends must be used because of a bug in the standard compiler
== Firmware replacement ==
TI continued to rely on RSA cryptographic signing keys only 512 bits long for many years after it was known that longer keys were necessary for security. 512-bit keys had been publicly cracked in 1999 as part of the RSA Factoring Challenge.

In 2009, a group of enthusiasts used brute force and distributed methods to find all of the cryptographic signing keys for the TI calculator firmware, allowing users to directly flash their own operating systems to the devices. The key for the TI-83 Plus calculator was first published by someone at the unitedti.org forum. They needed several months to crack it. The other keys were found after a few weeks by the unitedti.org community through a distributed computing project. Texas Instruments then began sending out DMCA take-down requests to a variety of different websites mirroring the keys, including unitedTI and reddit.com. They then became subject to the Streisand effect and were mirrored on a number of different sites.

== Successor ==
The TI-84 Plus series was introduced in April 2004 as a further update to the TI-83 Plus line. Despite the new appearance, there are very few actual changes. The main improvements of the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition are a modernized case design, changeable faceplates (Silver Edition only), a few new functions, more speed and memory, a clock, and USB port connectivity. The TI-84 Plus also has a brighter screen with a clearer contrast, though this caused a bug with the LCD driver in some calculators sold. The TI-84 Plus has 3 times the memory of the TI-83 Plus, and the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition has 9 times the memory of the TI-83 Plus. They both have 2.5 times the speed of the TI-83 Plus. The operating system and math functionality remain essentially the same, as does the standard link port for connecting with the rest of the TI calculator series.

While mobile devices and the internet have superseded any calculator&#x27;s capabilities, standardized testing precludes the use of those devices. Furthermore, textbooks have been tailored for the TI-83 effectively giving the calculator a &quot;monopoly in the field of high school mathematics.&quot;

<text>A scientific calculator is an electronic calculator, either desktop or handheld, designed to perform calculations using basic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced (trigonometric, hyperbolic, etc.) mathematical operations and functions. They have completely replaced slide rules as well as books of mathematical tables and are used in both educational and professional settings.

In some areas of study and professions scientific calculators have been replaced by graphing calculators and financial calculators which have the capabilities of a scientific calculator along with the capability to graph input data and functions, as well as by numerical computing, computer algebra, statistical, and spreadsheet software packages running on personal computers. Both desktop and mobile software calculators can also emulate many functions of a physical scientific calculator. Standalone scientific calculators remain popular in secondary and tertiary education because computers and smartphones are often prohibited during exams to reduce the likelihood of cheating.

== Functions ==
When electronic calculators were originally marketed they normally had only four or five capabilities (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root). Modern scientific calculators generally have many more capabilities than the original four- or five-function calculator, and the capabilities differ between manufacturers and models. 

The capabilities of a modern scientific calculator include:

* Scientific notation
* Floating-point decimal arithmetic
* Logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base
* Trigonometric functions (some including hyperbolic trigonometry)
* Exponential functions and roots beyond the square root
* Quick access to constants such as  and 

In addition, high-end scientific calculators generally include some or all of the following:

* Cursor controls to edit equations and view previous calculations (some calculators such as the &quot;LCD-8310&quot;, badge engineered under both &quot;Olympia&quot; and &quot;United Office&quot; keep the number of the previous result on-screen for convenience while the new calculation is being entered.)
* Hexadecimal, binary, and octal calculations, including basic Boolean mathematics
* Complex numbers
* Fractions calculations
* Statistics and probability calculations
* Programmability — see Programmable calculator
* Equation solving and computer algebra 
* Matrix calculations
* Calculus
* Letters that can be used for spelling words or including variables into an equation
* Conversion of units
* Physical constants
* Vector calculations
* Random number generation

While most scientific calculators have traditionally used a single-line display similar to traditional pocket calculators, many of them have more digits (10 to 12), sometimes with extra digits for the floating-point exponent. A few have multi-line displays, with some models from Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments (both US manufacturers), Casio, Sharp, and Canon (all three Japanese makers) using dot matrix displays similar to those found on graphing calculators.

== Uses ==

Scientific calculators are used widely in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions, especially those that were once looked up in mathematical tables, such as trigonometric functions or logarithms. They are also used for calculations of very large or very small numbers, as in some aspects of astronomy, physics, and chemistry.

They are very often required for math classes from the junior high school level through college, and are generally either permitted or required on many standardized tests covering math and science subjects; as a result, many are sold into educational markets to cover this demand, and some high-end models include features making it easier to translate a problem on a textbook page into calculator input, e.g. by providing a method to enter an entire problem in as it is written on the page using simple formatting tools.

==History==

The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic ideas above was the programmable Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A, released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs. The HP-9100 series was built entirely from discrete transistor logic with no integrated circuits, and was one of the first uses of the CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first calculator based on reverse Polish notation (RPN) entry. HP became closely identified with RPN calculators from then on, and even today some of their high-end calculators (particularly the long-lived HP-12C financial calculator and the HP-48 series of graphing calculators) still offer RPN as their default input mode due to having garnered a very large following.

The HP-35, introduced on February 1, 1972, was Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s first pocket calculator and the world&#x27;s first handheld scientific calculator. Like some of HP&#x27;s desktop calculators it used RPN. Introduced at US$395, the HP-35 was available from 1972 to 1975.

Texas Instruments (TI), after the production of several units with scientific notation, introduced a handheld scientific calculator on January 15, 1974, in the form of the SR-50. TI&#x27;s long-running TI-30 series being one of the most widely used scientific calculators in classrooms.

Casio, Canon, and Sharp, produced their graphing calculators, with Casio&#x27;s FX series (beginning with the Casio FX-1 in 1972). Casio was the first company to produce a Graphing calculator (Casio fx-7000G).

<doc id="439720" wikidata="Q7402" url="?curid=439720" title="Emperor Xiaowu of Jin">
<text>Emperor Xiaowu of Jin (; 362 – 6 November 396), personal name Sima Yao (), courtesy name Changming (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty in China. During his reign, Jin saw his dynasty survive a major attempt by Former Qin to destroy it, but he would nevertheless be the last Jin emperor to actually exercise imperial power, as his sons Emperor An and Emperor Gong would be controlled by regents and warlords. Emperor Xiaowu died an unusual death—he was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after he insulted her.

== Early life ==
Sima Yao was born in 362, when his father Sima Yu was Prince of Kuaiji and prime minister for his grandnephew, Emperor Ai. Sima Yao&#x27;s mother, Li Lingrong, was originally a servant involved in textile production but, based on a magician&#x27;s words that she would bear his heir (his sons all having died early by that point), Sima Yu took her as his concubine and she gave birth to Sima Yao. As he was born at dawn, she named him Yao, with the courtesy name Changming, both meaning &quot;dawn&quot;. A year later she gave birth to his brother, Sima Daozi. As the oldest surviving son of Sima Yu, Sima Yao was designated as the heir apparent early in his life, and in 365, when he was just three years old, Emperor Fei offered the greater title of Prince of Langya to his father and the title of Prince of Kuaiji to him. Sima Yu declined, both personally and on his son&#x27;s behalf, and Emperor Fei did not insist on them taking on the greater titles.

In 371, having lost a devastating battle to the Former Yan general Murong Chui in 369, the paramount general Huan Wen accused Emperor Fei of impotence and of not being the biological father of his sons. He then deposed him and made Sima Yu the new emperor (as Emperor Jianwen), although actual power was in Huan&#x27;s hands. In 372, Emperor Jianwen grew ill and he named Sima Yao crown prince on 12 September but in his will, he offered the throne to Huan, if he wanted it. When his official Wang Tanzhi () objected, Emperor Jianwen gave approval for an amendment, written by Wang, wherein Huan was only compared to the statesmen Zhuge Liang and Wang Dao. Nevertheless, when Emperor Jianwen died, many officials were apprehensive of Huan, and not immediately willing to declare Crown Prince Yao as the new emperor. Finally, at the instigation of Wang Biaozhi (), Crown Prince Yao took the throne as Emperor Xiaowu.

== Early reign ==
The new emperor was only 10 years old. Therefore, his cousin Empress Dowager Chu (Emperor Kang&#x27;s wife and niece of Xie Shang) served as regent, but the decisions were actually being made by Xie An and Wang Tanzhi; Huan Wen, apparently fearful of being entrapped, declined an offer to be regent. In 373, Huan Wen died and the fears of a Huan usurpation dissipated as his brother and successor, Huan Chong, was committed to the survival of the imperial government.

A major issue for the Jin government was the continued military pressure exerted by the powerful northern rival, Former Qin. In 373, Former Qin attacked and seized Jin&#x27;s Liang (梁州, modern southern Shaanxi) and Yi (益州, modern Sichuan and Chongqing) provinces. Internally, however, Jin was apparently well-governed by Xie and Huan Chong.

On 1 October 375, Emperor Xiaowu married Wang Fahui (the daughter of the official, Wang Yun ()) as his empress. He was 13 and she was 15. He also started studying the Chinese classic texts and writing poetry. In 376, Empress Dowager Chu officially removed herself from the regent position and returned her powers to Emperor Xiaowu, although the decisions were still largely being made by Xie.

In 376, the Jin vassal, Former Liang, was attacked by Former Qin. Jin forces, under Huan Chong&#x27;s command, attempted to relieve the pressure on Former Liang by attacking Former Qin, but Former Liang fell quickly and Huan Chong withdrew his forces. In apprehension of a Former Qin attack, Jin evacuated much of its population north of the Huai River to regions south of the river.

In 378, Former Qin made major attacks against the important Jin cities of Xiangyang, Weixing (魏興, in modern Ankang, Shaanxi), and Pengcheng. While general Xie Xuan was able to immediately recapture Pengcheng after it fell, Xiangyang and Weixing were taken by Former Qin forces in 379.

On 24 October 380, Empress Wang died. Emperor Xiaowu did not have another empress for the rest of his life.

In 381, Emperor Xiaowu began to study Buddhist sutras and he established a Buddhist study hall inside his palace, inviting monks to live within.

In 383, Huan Chong made a counterattack against Former Qin, hoping to recapture Xiangyang and the southwest. However, after initial losses, Huan abandoned the campaign.

== The Battle of Fei River ==

In November 383, Former Qin&#x27;s emperor, Fu Jiān, launched a major attack against Jin, intending to destroy it and unite China. At the Battle of Fei River, however, his forces panicked after trying to retreat to draw Jin forces across the river, and his army was routed with great losses, including his brother and prime minister, Fu Rong. Former Qin began to collapse after this defeat and never again posed a threat to Jin.

== Middle reign ==
After defeating Former Qin forces, Xie Xuan spearheaded a campaign to regain lost territory, and Jin captured most of the Former Qin provinces south of the Yellow River, as well as regaining Liang and Yi provinces. However, Prime Minister Xie An, who was most credited with the victory, began to lose favor in Emperor Xiaowu&#x27;s eyes; Xie&#x27;s son-in-law, Wang Guobao (), unhappy that Xie did not give him important posts, began to flatter both Emperor Xiaowu and his brother, Sima Daozi, the Prince of Kuaiji, as a means of undercutting Xie. Xie remained prime minister, however, until his death in 385; he was replaced by Sima Daozi. Both Emperor Xiaowu and Sima became obsessed with feasting and drinking, and neither spent much time on affairs of state.

In 387, Emperor Xiaowu named his oldest son, five-year-old Sima Dezong, crown prince, notwithstanding the fact that Sima was developmentally disabled—so severely that even after he grew older, he was described as not being able to talk, dress himself, or to tell whether he was full or hungry while eating.

In 390, Emperor Xiaowu began to tire of how his brother, Sima Daozi, was taking his favors for granted, and he decided to look for counterbalancing forces. He made the officials Wang Gong (王恭, Empress Wang&#x27;s brother) and Yin Zhongkan () key regional governors, despite warnings that both Wang and Yin were talented but narrow-minded, and might create issues later.

== Late reign ==
By 395, the conflict between Emperor Xiaowu and Sima had flared into the open, but because of the intercession of Empress Dowager Li, Emperor Xiaowu did not remove his brother. After further mediation by Xu Miao (), the relationship between the brothers seemed to be restored.

By 396, Emperor Xiaowu was spending so much of his time on drinking and women that he was not tending to important matters of state. His favorite consort was the beautiful Honoured Lady Zhang. On 6 November 396, when she was almost 30 years old, Emperor joked at a feast saying, &quot;Based on your age, you should yield your position. I want someone younger.&quot; That night, after Emperor Xiaowu fell drunk, she ordered all the eunuchs away, bribing them with wine, and then ordered her servant girls to suffocate Emperor Xiaowu by putting a blanket over his face. She further bribed the attendants and claimed that the emperor died suddenly in his sleep. The death was not investigated and the next day, Sima Dezong assumed the throne as Emperor An, with Sima Daozi as regent.

<doc id="439721" wikidata="Q1100720" url="?curid=439721" title="Cleveland Torso Murderer">
<text>The Cleveland Torso Murderer, also known as the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run, was an unidentified serial killer who was active in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in the 1930s. The killings were characterized by the dismemberment of thirteen known victims and the disposal of their remains in the impoverished neighborhood of Kingsbury Run. Most victims came from an area east of Kingsbury Run called &quot;The Roaring Third&quot; or &quot;Hobo Jungle&quot;, known for its bars, gambling dens, brothels, and vagrants. Despite an investigation of the murders, which at one time was led by famed lawman Eliot Ness, the murderer was never apprehended. In 2024, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office teamed up with the DNA Doe Project to exhume some of the victims and use investigative genetic genealogy to identify them.

==Murders==

The official number of murders attributed to the Cleveland Torso Murderer is twelve, although recent research has shown there could have been as many as twenty or more. The twelve known victims were killed between 1935 and 1938. Some investigators, including lead detective Peter Merylo, believed that there may have been thirteen or more victims in the Cleveland, Youngstown, and Pittsburgh areas between the 1920s and 1950s. Two strong candidates for addition to the &quot;official&quot; list are the unknown victim nicknamed the &quot;Lady of the Lake,&quot; found on September 5, 1934, and Robert Robertson, found on July 22, 1950.

The victims of the Torso Murderer were usually drifters whose identities were never determined, although there were a few exceptions. Victims numbers 2, 3, and 8 were identified as Edward Andrassy, Florence Polillo, and possibly Rose Wallace, respectively. Andrassy and Polillo were both identified by their fingerprints, while Wallace was tentatively identified via her dental records. The victims appeared to be lower class individualseasy prey during the Great Depression. Many were known as &quot;working poor,&quot; who had nowhere else to live but the ramshackle shanty towns, or &quot;Hoovervilles,&quot; in the area known as the Cleveland Flats.

The Torso Murderer always beheaded and often dismembered their victims, occasionally severing the victim&#x27;s torso in half or severing their appendages. In many cases the cause of death was the decapitation or dismemberment itself. Most of the male victims were castrated. Some victims showed evidence of chemical treatment being applied to their bodies, which caused the skin to become red, tough and leathery. Many were found after a considerable period of time following their deaths, occasionally in excess of a year. In an era when forensic science was largely in its infancy, these factors further complicated identification, especially since the heads were often undiscovered.

During the time of the &quot;official&quot; murders, Eliot Ness, leader of The Untouchables, was serving as Cleveland&#x27;s Public Safety Director, a position with authority over the police department and ancillary services, including the fire department. Ness contributed to the arrest and interrogation of one of the prime suspects, Dr. Francis Sweeney, and personally conducted raids into shantytowns and eventually burned them down. Ness&#x27;s reasoning for doing so was to catalogue fingerprints to easily identify any new victims, and to get possible victims out of the area in an attempt to stop the murders.

Four days after the burning, on August 22, 1938, Ness launched an equally draconian operation where he personally dispatched six two-man search teams on a large area of Cleveland, stretching from the Cuyahoga River to East 55th Street to Prospect Avenue, under the guise of conducting city fire inspections. While the search never turned up any new or incriminating information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the Torso Murderer, it did serve to focus renewed public attention on the inadequate and unsanitary living conditions in the downtown area. Teams uncovered hundreds of families living in hazardous fire traps without toilets or running water. The interests of social reform did ultimately come to light even if those of law enforcement did not. At one point, the Torso Murderer taunted Ness by placing the remains of two victims in full view of his office at City Hall. The man who Ness believed to be the killer would later also provoke him by sending postcards.

==Victims==
Most researchers consider there to be twelve victims, although some have counted as many as twenty or forty. Evidence suggests a woman dubbed the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; could be included. There was a second victim who was also considered to be a victim of the Torso Murderer in 1950 named Robert Robertson due to the fact that his head was also cut off in a manner very similar to the confirmed victims. Only three victims were positively identified; the other ten were six John Does and four Jane Does. Exhumations of unidentified victims started in August 2024 after the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office partnered with the DNA Doe Project to identify the victims through genetic genealogy.

===Edward Andrassy===

Edward Anthony Andrassy, age 29, was discovered on September 23, 1935, in a gully at the base of Jackass Hill where East 49th Street dead-ends into Kingsbury Run. Andrassy&#x27;s head was discovered buried near the rest of his body, which was found to be emasculated and only wearing socks. The autopsy report stated that Andrassy was decapitated in the mid-cervical region with a fracture of the mid-cervical vertebrae. The coroner also noted that he had rope burns around his wrists. The cause of death was decapitation; hemorrhage and shock. He had been dead for two to three days. At one time, Andrassy had been an orderly in the psychiatric ward at Cleveland City Hospital. However, at the time of his death, he was unemployed and had no visible means of financial support.

===John Doe I===
The decapitated remains of another white male were also located in weeds at the foot of East 49th Street and Praha Avenue next to Andrassy. Evidence suggested that the unidentified victim&#x27;s body was saturated with oil and set afire after death, causing the skin to become reddish and leathery. It also appeared as though the victim&#x27;s body hair had either been shaved or burned off. The unidentified male became known as John Doe I.

===Florence Polillo===

Florence Genevieve Polillo, age 44, was discovered at 2315 to 2325 East 20th Street in Cleveland. Florence was found dismembered and had been wrapped with paper and packed into half-bushel baskets, but her head was never discovered. The autopsy report stated that her cause of death was a slit throat. Due to the lack of the head, the coroner could not definitively rule her death a homicide.

===John Doe II (The Tattooed Man)===

The decapitated torso of an unidentified man was located on June 5, 1936, between the New York Central and Nickel Plate Road tracks next to an old freight shed in front of the Nickel Plate Road police building. His head was found near the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit tracks.

The victim&#x27;s body was nude but unmutilated and found only about fifteen hundred feet away from the head. There was no blood on the ground, indicating he had been killed elsewhere. A railroad worker testified that the head was not in the vicinity at 3:00 p.m. that day, and an eyewitness described seeing a late-model Cadillac close to the crime scene at about 11:00 p.m. that same night.

The physical evidence of the decapitation suggested it had been done while the victim was alive, and the autopsy report stated that the body was drained of blood. The head had been cut off between the first and second cervical vertebrae. There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol in the victim&#x27;s body, and nothing to suggest that he had been tortured or bound before being killed. John Doe II had six tattoos, hence the nickname &quot;The Tattooed Man&quot;.

===John Doe III===
On July 22, 1936, the severely decomposed, decapitated remains of a white male were located near a homeless camp in the Big Creek area of Brooklyn, west of Cleveland. This was the only known West Side victim of the Torso Murderer. Police conducted a thorough search of the area and found the man&#x27;s head, which was a skull at that point. Cheaply made, bloodstained clothing was found nearby. A pathologist discovered a large quantity of dried blood that had seeped into the ground beneath the man&#x27;s body, indicating he was killed at that location.

For the first time the murderer had ventured far away from Kingsbury Run, and instead of transporting the victim, he had killed him in the place he was discovered. The victim&#x27;s long hair, poor clothing and location near a homeless camp suggested he was one of the many vagrants who rode in and out of Cleveland on the nearby railroad tracks. However, the advanced state of decay of the body made it impossible to get any fingerprints, and the head would have been decomposed and unrecognizable by that point. Searches through missing persons reports were unsuccessful. The unidentified male became known as John Doe III.

===John Doe IV===
A homeless person discovered two halves of a male torso and lower legs floating in a stagnant pool near East 37th Street while waiting for an eastbound freight train. The torso was removed and sent to the morgue, where the coroner noted the body had been severed between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae as well as between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. A search was made for the rest of the body. Police found a dirty felt hat labelled &#x27;Laudy&#x27;s Smart Shop, Bellevue, Ohio&#x27;, which appeared to have blood spots on the top. A blue work shirt, covered with blood, was found wrapped in newspaper along the bank of the creek where the body was found. A fire crew dredged the water in the creek in attempt to locate more parts of the body. The head was never found, nor the body identified. The victim&#x27;s kidneys and stomach were removed, as were his genitals. The coroner declared the probable cause of death as decapitation. The unidentified male became known as John Doe IV.

===Jane Doe I===
On February 23, 1937, the upper portion of an unidentified female victim was found washed up on Euclid Beach on 156th Street. The legs, arms, and head were never found, likely because they were less buoyant than the torso and possibly sank to the bottom of the lake. Three months later the lower half of the torso washed ashore at East 30th Street. The upper extremities were disarticulated at the level of the glenoid fossa, better known as the socket of the shoulder joint. The neck and head were also disarticulated between the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae. Multiple hesitation knife marks at the surface of the skin were present. There was considerable water and gravel found in both pleural cavities. The probable cause of death was officially undetermined via the coroner&#x27;s case file. The unidentified female became known as Jane Doe I.

===Jane Doe II===
The eighth victim was located beneath the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge on June 6, 1937. Lying in a rotting burlap bag, along with a newspaper from June 1936, was the partial skeleton of a woman who had been dead approximately one year. The body was decapitated and missing a rib. She was tentatively identified as 40-year-old prostitute Rose Wallace, who had vanished from the same bar Polillo had, but this could not be confirmed. Wallace was known to have disappeared ten months earlier on August 21, 1936, while it was estimated that the victim had been dead for one year when found. Officially the victim remains unidentified and is known as Jane Doe II.

===John Doe V===
On July 6, 1937, the upper portion of a man&#x27;s torso wrapped in a burlap sack for chicken feed, plus his two thighs, were discovered floating in the Cuyahoga River in the Cleveland Flats just below Kingsbury Run. The head, as well as the internal organs within the abdominal cavity and the heart, were never found. The unidentified male became known as John Doe V.

===Jane Doe III===
On April 8, 1938, a woman&#x27;s leg was located in the Cuyahoga River in the Cleveland Flats. A month later on May 2, two burlap bags containing a woman&#x27;s nude bisected torso; thighs and feet were discovered floating in the river to the east of the West 3rd Street Bridge. Her head and arms were never found. She was the only victim to have morphine in her system, estimated at 0.002 gm. per 100 gm. sample. The unidentified female became known as Jane Doe III.

===Jane Doe IV and John Doe VI===
On August 16, 1938, a dismembered body was found at a dump at the end of East Ninth Street in Cleveland, Ohio, by men combing for pieces of scrap metal. The body of a woman was wrapped in rags, brown paper, and cardboard. Uncharacteristically, the head and hands were found with the rest of the body. The victim&#x27;s head had been disarticulated at the level of the third intervertebral disc. The unidentified female became known as Jane Doe IV.

On the same day, the body of John Doe VI was discovered at a nearby location on the Cleveland lakefront, in plain view of Safety Director Eliot Ness&#x27;s office at City Hall. Similar to the other victims, the head was severed from the body and the victim remains unidentified. The head was disarticulated at the level of the third inter-vertebral disc and had knife marks on the dorsum of the second and third cervical vertebrae. Extremities at all the major joints were all disarticulated as well. The coroner ruled the cause of death as undetermined though he noted it was probably a homicide.

==Possible victims==
===Lady of the Lake===
The lower half of a woman&#x27;s torso, thighs still attached but amputated at the knees, washed up on the shores of Lake Erie just east of Bratenahl on September 5, 1934. A subsequent search yielded only a few other body parts. The head was never found. She was nicknamed the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;. She had an abdominal scar from a likely hysterectomy, which was common and made it more difficult to identify her. After she was found, several people reported seeing body parts in the water, including a group of fishermen who believed to have seen a head.

The Lady of the Lake was found virtually in the same spot as Jane Doe I. Both victims had on their skin a chemical which was believed to have been lime chloride. It is supposed that the killer meant to use a quickening lime to decompose the bodies quicker, but mistakenly used lime that would preserve the bodies instead.

===Robert Robertson===
On July 22, 1950, Robert Robertson, age 41, was discovered at 2138 Davenport Avenue in Cleveland. Police believed he had been dead six to eight weeks and appeared to have been intentionally decapitated, fitting the profile of other victims. Robertson was estranged from his family, had an arrest record, and was an alcoholic on the fringes of society. Despite widespread newspaper coverage linking his death to the Torso Murderer, detectives treated it as an isolated crime.

==Other possible related murders==
Between 1921 and 1942, nine people, eight of them unidentified, were found dead and dismembered in swamps or around train yards near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The so-called &quot;Murder Swamp Killings&quot; have been theorized to be additional victims of the Torso Murderer. The almost identical similarities between the Pittsburgh victims to those in Cleveland, both of which were directly connected by a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, were enough to convince Cleveland investigator Peter Merylo that the Pittsburgh murders were related.

The headless body of an unidentified male was found in a boxcar in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on July 1, 1936. Three headless victims were found in boxcars near McKees Rocks on May 3, 1940. All bore similar injuries to those inflicted by the Torso Murderer. Dismembered bodies were also found in the swamps near New Castle between 1921 and 1934 and between 1939 and 1942.

==Possible link to Black Dahlia Murder==
In December 1938, the Torso Murderer allegedly sent a letter to Ness, claiming that he had moved to California and killed a woman there and had buried the head in Los Angeles. In the letter, the killer referred to himself as a &quot;DC&quot; or Doctor of Chiropractic. An investigation uncovered animal bones.

A decade later, this &quot;confession&quot; resulted in authorities considering the possibility that the Torso Murderer had some connection to the Black Dahlia case, in which the bisected remains of 22-year-old Elizabeth Short were found in the unfinished Leimert Park housing development of Los Angeles on January 15, 1947. Both Short and the Torso Murderer victims had been thoroughly cleaned after death, and a butcher knife was believed to have been used in both cases. However, Short was not decapitated, as was a signature for the Cleveland victims. Furthermore, the murder took place a near-decade after the letter was received. Aside from circumstantial evidence and sheer speculation, there is nothing connecting Short to the Torso Murderer.

==Suspects==
Authorities interrogated around 9,100 people during the search to find the Torso Murderer. There were only two main suspects: Frank Dolezal and Francis Sweeney. On August 24, 1939, a 52-year-old Cleveland resident named Frank Dolezal (May 4, 1887 – August 24, 1939), who at one point lived with Polillo and also had connections to Andrassy and Wallace, was arrested as a suspect in Polillo&#x27;s murder; he later died under suspicious circumstances in the Cuyahoga County jail while in the custody of Sheriff Martin O&#x27;Donnell. Dolezal was later posthumously exonerated of involvement in the Torso slayings.

The other lead suspect, Dr. Francis Edward “Frank” Sweeney (May 5, 1894 – July 9, 1964), was a veteran of World War I who was part of a medical unit that conducted amputations in the field and at one point suffered nerve damage from a gas attack. After the war, Sweeney became an alcoholic due to pathological anxiety and depression derived from his wartime experiences. His heavy drinking began in 1929; by 1934 his alcoholism led to a separation from his wife.

Sweeney was personally interviewed by Ness. Before the interrogation, Sweeney was found to be so intoxicated that he was held in a hotel room for three days until he sobered up. Under questioning, he is said to have &quot;failed to pass&quot; two very early polygraph machine tests. Both tests were administered by polygraph expert Leonarde Keeler, who told Ness that Sweeney was the culprit. Ness apparently felt there was little chance of obtaining a successful prosecution, however, especially as Sweeney was the first cousin of one of Ness&#x27;s political opponents, U.S. Congressman Martin L. Sweeney, who had hounded Ness publicly about his failure to catch the killer.

After Sweeney committed himself to an institution, there were no more leads or connections that police could assign to him as a possible suspect. From his confinement, Sweeney sent threatening postcards and harassed Ness and his family into the 1950s; the postcards only stopped arriving after his death. Sweeney died in a veterans&#x27; hospital in Dayton, Ohio, on July 9, 1964.

While Sweeney was considered a viable suspect, the evidence against him was purely circumstantial. In 1929, Sweeney was a surgical resident at St. Alexis Hospital in the Kingsbury Run area. He also had an office on the same street where a man named Emil Fronek claimed a doctor had tried to drug him in 1934. Fronek&#x27;s story was ultimately discounted as he could not relocate the building with police the following day. Upon finding a victim with drugs in her system and looking through buildings, it was found that Sweeney did have an office next to a coroner, in the area where Fronek had suggested he had been drugged. Sweeney would practice in their morgue, which would have been a clean and convenient location to kill victims.

In addition to Dolezal and Sweeney, authorities also considered Willie Johnson, an African-American male who committed a similar murder in June 1942. Johnson had been spotted by a young girl while disposing of a trunk, which was later found to contain the torso of 19-year-old Margaret Frances Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s head and arms were found in nearby bushes, while her legs would be found at Johnson&#x27;s home two weeks later. It was claimed that Johnson was acquainted with Wallace and, possibly, Polillo, but, while Coroner Samuel Gerber touted him as a suspect, he was never conclusively linked to the Torso Murders. Johnson was tried and convicted of Wilson&#x27;s murder and, after a lengthy psychological evaluation, executed by electric chair on March 10, 1944.

In 1997, another theory postulated that there may have been no single Torso Murderer—that the killings could have been committed by different people. This was based on the assumption that the autopsy results were inconclusive. Merylo believed that the Torso Murderer could have been a transient who was riding the rails, as most of the murders occurred near railroad tracks, and believed this was why there were murders in other states that were similar to the killings in Cleveland. Merylo went undercover as a hobo to investigate this idea.

== In popular culture ==
The 2018 film &quot;The Kingsbury Run&quot; was based on a modern copycat of the murders. The murders and the hunt for the perpetrators were also covered in an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;. The award-winning graphic novel &quot;Torso&quot; written by Brian Michael Bendis tells the hunt for the killer by Eliot Ness.

American author John Peyton Cooke wrote a fictionalized account of the murders in his novel &quot;Torsos&quot;, which was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award for Best Gay Men&#x27;s Mystery for 1993, and was noted by Marilyn Stasio in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; for its atmospheric depiction of Cleveland, Ohio, during the Great Depression.

&quot;The Unknown Beloved&quot; by Amy Harmon is a fictionalized treatment of the Cleveland Torso Murders.

&quot;American Demon,&quot; written by author Daniel Stashower, details the murders and the subsequent investigation by Eliot Ness.

&quot;Trail of Cthulhu&quot;, a tabletop role-playing game inspired by the works of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, contains an introductory adventure in the first edition rulebook entitled &quot;The Kingsbury Horror&quot; which is based on the Torso Murders.

<doc id="439722" wikidata="Q1011901" url="?curid=439722" title="Jarrell, Texas">
<text>Jarrell is a city in Williamson County, Texas, United States. The total population is 1,753 according to the 2020 census.

==History==
Founded in 1909 by real estate developer O.D. Jarrell, along with E. C. Haeber and B. N. Dover, the town was settled at the intersection of an old stagecoach road and the Bartlett Western Railroad that was under construction. Soon after the railroad was completed, a saloon, two stores, a post office, and a bank were built. Because of the proximity of Jarrell to the railroad, Jarrell received all of the people and most of the buildings of nearby Corn Hill, Texas, thus killing that town. The city reached a population peak of 500 residents in 1914. The closing of the railway in 1935 and the decline of the cotton industry, however, led to a long-term recession. At one point, Jarrell had only 200 residents. After this low point, the city experienced a recovery that increased its population to 410 by 1990. Over 15 new businesses opened in Jarrell in 2009.

In 2001 Jarrell incorporated as a city. Wayne Cavalier became the first mayor for the City of Jarrell.

==Geography==
===Climate===

The climate in the area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Jarrell has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

===Tornadoes===
Jarrell has been affected by two major tornadoes in its history. The first one was an F3 that occurred on May 17, 1989, killing one person and injuring 28 people. Damage was incurred mainly on the southern side of town.
On May 27, 1997, an F5 tornado devastated the northern side of town. The hardest-hit area was the Double Creek Estates subdivision, which was completely obliterated, with all of the homes in the neighborhood being destroyed. Twenty-seven people were killed in this tornado.
==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,753 people, 417 households, and 365 families residing in the city.

== Government ==
Jarrell is a type A General-Law city. 

==Education==

Jarrell is served by the Jarrell Independent School District. The district currently has three elementary schools, one middle school and one high school.

Between 2012 and 2019, student enrollment more than doubled. The district&#x27;s middle school was built in 2014, but underwent an expansion in 2018–2019 to gain more classroom and science labs so that it could better accommodate the growing population of students. The high school is also being expanded, including the addition of a performing arts center.

In 2023, Jarrell ISD formed its own ISD Police Department.

==Infrastructure==

Jarrell sits directly along Interstate 35, with access to Ronald Reagan Boulevard.

Emergency services are provided by the Jarrell Fire Department, operating under Williamson County ESD#5.

The Jarrell Police Department was created in 2006. In 2014, Chief Andres Gutierrez was sentenced to 54 months in federal prison and three years of supervised release after pleading guilty to a wire fraud/theft of honest services charge.

==Notable People==
* Preston Smith, 40th Governor of Texas: born in Corn Hill which later was absorbed by Jarrell.

<doc id="439725" wikidata="Q2289034" url="?curid=439725" title="Singapore Democratic Alliance">
<text>The Singapore Democratic Alliance (abbreviation: SDA) is an opposition political coalition between Singapore Justice Party (SJP), Singapore Malay National Organization (PKMS), Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), National Solidarity Party (NSP) and Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP) in 2001. As of 2023, only SJP and PKMS are in the alliance.

==History==
Prior to the founding in 2001, then-opposition Member of Parliament (MP) for Potong Pasir Chiam See Tong was a member of Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). Chiam resigned to join Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP) ahead of the 1997 elections due to a leadership schism with another member, Chee Soon Juan, who was made the party&#x27;s secretary-general.

The party was first established in 2001 by Chiam where he want to provide a common grouping under which different opposition parties could stand as a political coalition in elections against the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP). The alliance was initially a four-party coalition, which consist of his party of SPP (which adopted the party&#x27;s logo at the time), as well as the National Solidarity Party (NSP), the Singapore Justice Party (SJP) and the Singapore Malay National Organization (PKMS). Notable members include Cheo Chai Chen and Tan Lead Shake of the SDP and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) respectively, later joined the SDA where they represent the NSP. The alliance of four parties contested in both the 2001 and 2006 elections. It was the first coalition in post-independence since 1963, after the now-defunct Singapore Alliance Party.

After the 2006 elections, two parties withdrew from the SDA before the next election; In 2007, the NSP withdrew in hopes of rejuvenating the party, and later on 2 March 2011, the SPP, after Chiam, mostly for health reasons, was relieved of his role as chairman after the Council voted for three days earlier, and SPP further cited their disagreements (notably the PKMS) for attempting to invite Reform Party (RP), a party which was newly formed on 3 July 2008, to SDA, and also fielding a successor for the ward (who later went on to choose Chiam&#x27;s wife, Lina Loh) while Chiam would go to contest Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC. SDA now consists of PKMS and SJP. The chairperson was later succeeded by the SJP&#x27;s leader Desmond Lim, notable for helping Chiam in managing his town council funds.

However, the separation of Chiam&#x27;s SPP saw waning on the alliance, where they fell short on winning the elections. In the 2011 elections, neither the NSP (who field a large slate of candidates for the election), SDA, or SPP were successful: SPP&#x27;s Loh was made a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament although losing the contest to a three-time PAP candidate Sitoh Yih Pin, by a wafer-thin margin of 0.72% or 114 votes; candidate Desmond Lim became the only candidate forfeiting his electoral deposit (S$16,000) in the only three-cornered contest in the newly formed Punggol East SMC (a ward carved out from the neighbouring Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, which the alliance also contest); and members who joined as independents contesting in Tanjong Pagar GRC (the election&#x27;s only uncontested constituency) was disqualified during nomination day. In the 2015 election, SDA fielded their only team of six in the only contested constituency of Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC, but with no success.

In the 2013 by-election, Lim contested again, but later conceded defeat during vote counting; ultimately, he garnered only 0.53% of the valid votes cast for the election, resulting him as the second candidate in history (after United People&#x27;s Front candidate Harbans Singh) to have his deposit forfeited on both times, and consequently set its record-worst score for a candidate in post-independence Singapore.

The party contested in the 2020 election, with the election marked Lim&#x27;s last election leading the party. Their party only contested Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, which produced a rare three-cornered contest against a third party, Peoples Voice, making it only the second time in the election&#x27;s history a multi-cornered fight occurred within a GRC (the first being 1992&#x27;s by-election under Marine Parade GRC). The party scored 23.67% of the votes while PV ended up losing their deposits after garnering 12.18%. Prior to the elections, there was a joint alliance between the four parties, Singaporeans First, People&#x27;s Power Party, Reform Party and Democratic Progressive Party, who initially announced to form an alliance of their own, but ended up applying for the SDA on 1 April and has never materialized.

<text>Theodor Adrian von Renteln (15 September 1897 – 1946 (disputed)) was a German Nazi activist and politician. During World War II, he was General Commissioner of &quot;Generalbezirk Litauen&quot; and was involved in perpetrating the Holocaust in Lithuania.

Of Baltic German origin, von Renteln studied law and economics in Berlin and Rostock, but became a journalist. In 1928, he joined the NSDAP and the following year, he became the founder and head of the National Socialist Schoolchildren&#x27;s League (NSS). In 1931, he was appointed the head of the Hitler Youth, but he gave up leadership of the two organizations upon his election to the Reichstag in 1932.

In 1932–1933 he led the Combat League of the Commercial Middle Class (&quot;NS-Kampfbund für den Gewerblichen Mittelstand&quot;), an organisation allegedly &quot;Deflecting Jewish Atrocity and Boycott-Mongering&quot;, participating in the boycott of Jewish businesses and other forms of persecution. In June 1933, he was appointed President of the National Socialist Council of Industry and Trade (&quot;Nationalsozialistische Handwerks-, Handels-, und Gewerbeorganisation&quot; or NS-HAGO), holding this position until 1935, when this organisation was merged with the German Labor Front (DAF). Von Renteln became a staff leader of the German Labor Front. In 1940, he was appointed the Reich Leader of the Trade and Artisanship Section of the NSDAP (&quot;Hauptamtsleiter Handel und Handwerk in der Reichsleitung der NSDAP&quot;). He was also the head of the Supreme Court of the Reich Labor Front.

In July 1941, he was appointed the &quot;Generalkommissar&quot; of &quot;Generalbezirk Litauen&quot; (roughly modern Lithuania), where he took harsh measures against the Jewish population. On 26 August 1941 he ordered that all telephones and lines were to be stripped, postal service be cut off, and bridges to the Kaunas (Kovno) Ghetto be surrounded with barbed wire fences to prevent people from jumping off. This order also forbade the Jews of the Kovno ghetto to use doors, window frames, or houses for fuel. In 1943, he was implicated in the clearing of the Vilna Ghetto, deporting 20,000 Jews to concentration or death camps, as well as in plundering.

According to some accounts, after World War II, he was captured by the Russians, tried, and hanged for war crimes in 1946. According to other sources, after the war he lived under a false identity in South America and died there. His death has never been fully confirmed.

<doc id="439738" wikidata="Q1411292" url="?curid=439738" title="Fidelity Investments">
<text>Fidelity Investments, formerly known as Fidelity Management &amp; Research (FMR), is an American multinational financial services corporation based in Boston, Massachusetts. Established in 1946, the company is one of the largest asset managers in the world, with $5.8 trillion in assets under management, and $15.0 trillion in assets under administration, . 

Fidelity Investments operates a brokerage firm, manages a large family of mutual funds, provides fund distribution and investment advice, retirement services, index funds, wealth management, securities execution and clearance, asset custody, and life insurance.

==History==
The Fidelity Fund incorporated in Massachusetts on May 1, 1930, with Edward C. Johnson II serving as president. The corporate structure changed in 1946 and became known as Fidelity Management &amp; Research (FMR).

In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets and subsequently spun it off in 1980 into an independent entity owned by its employees.

In 1982, FMR company started offering 401(k) products. In 1984, it offered computerized stock trading.

In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.

In 2001, Geode Capital Management was established to run and incubate investment strategies for FMR. In 2003, it was spun off as an independent company.

In 2003, the company launched its first ETF, called the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Tracking Stock Fund (ONEQ).

In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.

In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.

In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.

In 2014, Abigail Johnson became president and CEO of Fidelity Investments (FMR) and chairman of Fidelity International (FIL).

In 2018, Fidelity launched a separate entity dedicated to institutional cryptoasset custody and cryptocurrency trading.

In May 2019, it was reported that the firm would soon be offering cryptocurrency trading to institutional customers.

In October 2019, the company launched Fidelity Digital Asset Services, which will handle cryptocurrency custody and trade execution for institutional investors. Subsequently, in March 2021, Fidelity filed for introducing a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC.

Fidelity&#x27;s assets under management climbed 26% in 2019 to a record $3.2 trillion, which helped boost revenue to $20.9 billion and operating income to $6.9 billion.

At the end of January 2020, Fidelity launched &quot;Stocks By The Slice&quot;, a program aimed at investors wishing to capitalize on fractional-share ownership and micro-investing. Micro-investing is a type of investment strategy that is designed to make investing regular, accessible and affordable, especially for those who may not have a lot of money to invest or who are new to investing.

In March 2020, Fidelity opened a new investor center in Chesnut Hill, MA.

In March 2021, FMR&#x27;s operating income rose 4.6%. In August 2021, Fidelity announced plans to hire 16,000 employees in 2021, including 9,000 during the second half of the year.

In April 2022, Fidelity Investments announced that it will start offering Bitcoin as an investment option, specifically in its 401(k) plans by the middle of the year. It is also the first major 401(k) provider to offer cryptocurrency as an investment for retirement savers, according to CNN. However, this option will only be offered to participants whose employers have elected to include it in their plan, as of now.

In June 2023, Fidelity applied with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In November 2023, they filed another application with the SEC to launch a Spot Ethereum ETF. The Bitcoin fund was granted approval and launched on January 11, 2024.

==Current operations==
===Mutual funds===
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company&#x27;s largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets, making it the largest non-indexed fund in the U.S. and the largest fund managed by an individual. William Danoff has managed Contrafund since 1990.

Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets. Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. Founded by Ned Johnson in 1963 as the Fidelity International Fund during what Peter Lynch called the &quot;great fund boom&quot;, it was renamed the Magellan Fund in 1965. As Lynch recounted, the early sales staff of the Magellan Fund was mostly part-time, traveling employees until the 1973–1974 stock market crash led to a severe decline in interest.

Magellan was managed by Johnson from May 2, 1963, to Dec. 31, 1971, Lynch from May 31, 1977, to May 31, 1990, and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012. Under Lynch&#x27;s leadership Magellan averaged 29% a year, more than doubling the growth rate of the benchmark S&amp;P 500, and remains the best-performing mutual fund in history over such an extended period. 

In 2018, Fidelity Investments introduced a new line of zero-expense-ratio mutual funds for individual investors. Fidelity&#x27;s first two zero expense ratio funds, ZERO Total Market Index Fund and ZERO International Index Fund have since grown to more than $1 billion in assets. Later that year, Fidelity introduced two more zero-expense funds. Together, the four Fidelity zero-expense-ratio equity funds provide market exposure to more than two-thirds of industry index assets.

===Brokerage===
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the U.S. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms, banks and trusts, family offices, and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010. By 2023 the firm had over 45 million brokerage accounts with over $4.5 Trillion in AUM and nearly $12 Trillion in AUA.

===Benefits outsourcing===
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015. Other services provided include pension administration, health &amp; welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.

===Devonshire Investors===
The company&#x27;s Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.

Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity. The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston. It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; in 2000 and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe, MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.

It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.

In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global. It formed ProBuild in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.

=== Donor-advised fund ===
Fidelity manages a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF), Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider.

=== Eight Roads ===
Fidelity International (FIL) also runs its own proprietary investing arm called Eight Roads. It is a global platform with 100+ investment professionals across China, Japan, India, Singapore and the UK. In 2018, Eight Roads launched a new European fund. In June 2019, Fidelity announced it may demerge Eight Roads from its core business.

==Investigation about insiders&#x27; private investments==

A private venture capital firm, F-Prime Capital Partners, managed on behalf of owners and other key leaders of Fidelity Investments, has been described as directly competing with Fidelity Investments public funds. A 2016 Reuters investigation identified multiple cases where F-Prime Capital Partners was able to make investments at a fraction of the price of Fidelity Investments. Because of SEC regulations, investments by F-Prime Capital Partners preclude Fidelity from making the same early investments. The investigation describes that this competition forces Fidelity to delay investing until later and at much higher prices than F-Prime Capital Partners, resulting in lower returns for Fidelity fund shareholders.

Corporate governance experts have stated that the practice is not illegal, but that it poses a clear corporate conflict of interest. Fidelity spokesmen have stated that they are following all laws and regulations.

The same Reuters investigation documents six cases (out of 10) where Fidelity Investments became one of the largest investors of F-Prime Capital companies after the start-up companies became publicly traded. Legal and academic experts said that major investments by Fidelity mutual funds - with their market-moving buying power - could be seen as propping up the values of the F-Prime Capital investments, to the benefit of Fidelity insiders.

Fidelity declined to comment on this aspect of the investigation.

==Legal issues==
===Document retention fines===
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined four FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.

In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.

===Misrepresentations===
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity&#x27;s Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.

==Ownership and management==

===Johnson Family===

The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a &quot;significant&quot; portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father. Abigail was named CEO in 2014, and chairman in 2016.

===Employees and ex-employees===

Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.

===Paul McCartney marketing campaign===
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing &quot;Never Stop Doing What You Love&quot;, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm&#x27;s spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled &quot;This Is Paul&quot;.

<doc id="439739" wikidata="Q1814900" url="?curid=439739" title="Tahir ibn Husayn">
<text>Ṭāhir ibn Ḥusayn, (, &quot;Tahir bin al-Husayn&quot;), also known as Dhul-Yamīnayn (, &quot;the ambidextrous&quot;), and al-Aʿwar (, &quot;the one-eyed&quot;), was a general and governor during the Abbasid Caliphate. Specifically, he served under al-Ma&#x27;mun during the Fourth Fitna and led the armies that would defeat al-Amin, making al-Ma&#x27;mun the &quot;caliph&quot;. 

Tahir bin al-Husayn was then appointed governor of Khorasan as a reward, which marked the beginning of the Tahirids.

== Early life ==

Tahir was born in Pushang which was a village near the ancient city of Herat in Khorasan. He was from a Persian &quot;dehqan&quot; noble family who had distinguished themselves since the Abbasid Revolution, and were previously awarded minor governorships in eastern Khorasan for their service to the Abbasids. His great-grandfather Ruzaiq was a &quot;mawla&quot; of Talha ibn Abd Allah al-Khuza&#x27;i, an Arab nobleman from the Khuza&#x27;a tribe, who served as the governor of Sistan. Ruzaiq&#x27;s son Mus&#x27;ab was the governor of Pushang and Herat. Mus&#x27;ab&#x27;s son, Husayn, who was the father of Tahir, continued to his father&#x27;s role as the governor of Pushang and Herat.

Under the governor of Khorasan, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, there were riots in the province because of the latter&#x27;s cruelty and persecution of other noble families, which included the family of Tahir; Tahir was imprisoned for some time and was mistreated. When he was released he fought on the side of Harthama ibn A&#x27;yan against Rafi ibn al-Layth in 808 when the latter rebelled at Samarkand, but when the Abbasid &quot;caliph&quot; Harun al-Rashid deposed Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, and sent general Harthama ibn A&#x27;yan against Rafi, he returned to obedience. During the event, Tahir lost an eye after an accident, which gained him the nickname &quot;al-A&#x27;war&quot; (&quot;the one-eyed&quot;). Tahir seems to have been quickly offended if someone picked him about his eye, even threatening a poet, who had humiliated him about his lost eye in a poem. The caliph Harun al-Rashid later died in 809, and was succeeded by his son al-Amin.

== Abbasid civil war ==

In 810, the caliph al-Amin, and his brother, Al-Ma&#x27;mun, came in conflict which each others, which later led to a civil war; in January 811, al-Amin formally began the Great Abbasid Civil War when he appointed Ali ibn Isa as governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000, drawn from an elite group known as &quot;abna′&quot;, and sent him to depose al-Ma&#x27;mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma&#x27;mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali&#x27;s approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma&#x27;mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000–5,000 men, under Tahir. Tahir was sent to confront Ali&#x27;s advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir&#x27;s own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle (3 July 811) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.

Tahir&#x27;s unexpected victory was decisive: al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s position was secured, while his main opponents, the &quot;abna′&quot;, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another &quot;abna′&quot; army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala after a series of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Banu Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa&#x27;s son, Husayn. However, al-Amin&#x27;s efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians&#x27; reluctance to get involved in the civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the &quot;abna′&quot; to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab support backfired on al-Amin, as the &quot;abna′&quot; began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma&#x27;mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the &quot;abna′&quot;, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin&#x27;s case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma&#x27;mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while his vizier Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of &quot;Dhu &#x27;l-Ri&#x27;asatayn&quot; (&quot;he of the two headships&quot;), signifying his control over both civil and military administration.

In spring 812, Tahir, reinforced with more troops under Harthama ibn A&#x27;yan, resumed his offensive. He invaded Khuzistan, where he defeated and killed the Muhallabid governor Muhammad ibn Yazid, whereupon the Muhallabids of Basra surrendered to him. Tahir also took Kufa and al-Mada&#x27;in, advancing on Baghdad from the west while Harthama closed in from the east. At the same time, al-Amin&#x27;s authority crumbled as supporters of al-Ma&#x27;mun took control of Mosul, Egypt and the Hejaz, while most of Syria, Armenia and Azerbaijan fell under the control of the local Arab tribal leaders. As Tahir&#x27;s army closed on Baghdad, the rift between al-Amin and the &quot;abna′&quot; was solidified when the desperate Caliph turned to the common people of the city for help and gave them arms. The &quot;abna′&quot; began deserting to Tahir in droves, and in August 812, when Tahir&#x27;s army appeared before the city, he established his quarters in the suburb of Harbiyya, traditionally an &quot;abna′&quot; stronghold. 

The Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy characterized the subsequent siege of the city as &quot;an episode almost without parallel in the history of early Islamic society&quot; and &quot;the nearest early Islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution&quot;, as Baghdad&#x27;s urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war. Indeed, it was this &quot;revolutionary&quot; situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers&#x27; professional expertise, that brought about its fall: in September 813, Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world, allowing al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s men to occupy the city&#x27;s eastern suburbs. Tahir then launched a final assault, in which al-Amin was captured and executed at Tahir&#x27;s orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama.

== Governor of Khorasan and death ==

Tahir was afterwards transferred out of the public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa. However, he was later recalled from the post, and was rewarded with the governorship of Khorasan. Tahir then began consolidating his authority over the region, appointing several officials to certain offices, including Muhammad ibn Husayn Qusi, who was appointed as the governor of Sistan. Tahir later declared independence from the Abbasid empire in 822 by omitting any mention of al-Ma&#x27;mun during a Friday sermon. However, he died the same night. According to some sources, he was poisoned by the orders of al-Ma&#x27;mun. Nevertheless, al-Ma&#x27;mun appointed Tahir&#x27;s son to continue at his father&#x27;s post. Tahir is said to have said his last words in Persian, his native language.

<text>(born February 26, 1964) is a Japanese artist and video game designer, best known for designing Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise. Although Yuji Naka made a tech demo around which &quot;Sonic&quot; gameplay was based, the character in his prototype was a ball that lacked any specific features and was based on Ohshima&#x27;s game proposal. Sonic Team considered numerous potential animal mascots before deciding on Ohshima&#x27;s design, with an armadillo or hedgehog being the top choices because their spikes worked well with the concept of rolling into enemies.

After leaving Sonic Team, Ohshima formed an independent game company called Artoon in 1999. There he went on to work on such games &quot;as Pinobee&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2002), and &quot;Blinx 2: Masters of Time &amp; Space&quot; (2004). In 2010, Artoon was absorbed into AQ Interactive, and Ohshima and other key members of Artoon left to form Arzest. Early in his career, he was credited under the nickname &quot;Big Island&quot; in a number of games, which is a literal translation of his family name.

<text>MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services.

Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund. The first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had $645.3 billion in assets under management as of September 30, 2024.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1924 by Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr. L. The company&#x27;s oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company&#x27;s inception and reported to be &quot;the world&#x27;s first open-end investment fund&quot;. The company used &quot;brokerage channels&quot; to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years. During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.

In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm&#x27;s broadened scope of products and services.

In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.

In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS&#x27;s assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.

During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made &quot;false and misleading&quot; statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. This was part of a wide-ranging investigation; see 2003 mutual fund scandal for additional details. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. MFS implemented company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. This ended &quot;soft-dollar&quot; arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.

From 2010 to 2020, assets under management grew from $253 billion to $528.4 billion.

In January 2025, MFS launched its first ETF products, including five different actively managed funds.

<doc id="439764" wikidata="Q5108907" url="?curid=439764" title="Christ Gospel Churches International">
<text>Christ Gospel Church (&quot;CGC&quot;) is a fundamentalist, Pentecostal non-denominational church organization founded in the 1950s by in Louisville, Kentucky, after Hicks split from William Branham&#x27;s congregation.

==Doctrines==

Christ Gospel Church&#x27;s Pentecostal emphasis is seen in teaching the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of glossolalia, or speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4,11,38).¹ However, church teachings do not believe that evidence of glossolalia is a requirement for salvation; rather, it is a gift that Christians can accept as they desire. The church also teaches that water baptism by immersion is a commandment for all Christians (Acts 2:38; 8:12; 9:5,18).¹ 

The church believes that worship should embrace all kinds of music (e.g., traditional hymns, choruses, country gospel, urban gospel, classical) and musical instruments (e.g., drums, guitars, pianos, saxophones, trumpets, violins). An example of the church&#x27;s uniquely intense style of worship can be found in the Harp Warriors&#x27; prayer meeting particularly popular with its younger members.

Concerning theology, the church teaches &quot;old-fashioned Holiness&quot; in matters of conduct and dress, such as refraining from watching television or attending movie theaters, and women wearing dresses or skirts rather than pants. 
The emphasis of Hicks&#x27; teachings was, among other things, that the Bible, particularly and exclusively the King James Version, is the infallible Word of God and that it calls on Christians to grow to spiritual maturity, both in their moral development and in their spiritual love relationship with Jesus Christ, in order to be in the Bride of Christ. The core of her distinctive approach to Scripture was founded on her belief that the Tabernacle used by the Israelites from the Exodus to the Conquest of Canaan was laid out in the form of a cross and serves as a picture or metaphor of Christian believers&#x27; spiritual experiences as they grow to maturity in Christ Jesus, as taught in the New Testament (Hebrews 9:8-11; Ephesians 2:19-22).

Hicks taught the doctrine of the Rapture of a select group of Christians called overcomers. Hicks also said on numerous occasions that Jesus Christ communicated with her both audibly and in person. These concepts can be found throughout Hicks&#x27;s numerous publications and in church teachings, which are offered on the church website. Neither Hicks&#x27; books nor the church generally cites or refers to any other denomination or spiritual leader.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref.

==International outreach==
Mission outreach is an important part of Christ Gospel Churches&#x27; ministry.

Over 1500 churches world-wide are affiliated with Christ Gospel Churches International Inc (CGCII). Each country&#x27;s Christ Gospel affiliated organization is an independent legal entity run by local church leaders. All follow the ecclesiastical model of faith expressed by Christ Gospel Churches International Inc.

Support for Mexico ministries is a major focus of Christ Gospel Churches International, Inc.

Christ Gospel Church is among the fastest growing evangelical groups in Mexico. Today, there are over 500 churches, an orphans&#x27; home, and two Bible schools.

CGCII provides seed funds to many local affiliated churches world-wide for the development of Christian congregations, church buildings, and many charitable works. Depending on local needs, CGCII also supports schools, orphanages, and feeding programs in Haiti, India, and Africa.

==Distribution==

Christ Gospel Churches International claims some 70 congregations in the United States, over 400 in India, about 500 in Mexico, and affiliates in several countries of Africa and Central America. There are congregations in El Salvador, England, the Faroe Islands, Germany, Guatemala, Haiti, Iceland, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Mongolia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, and various countries of South America, including Colombia and Ecuador. In all, the movement claims over 1,400 affiliated congregations in 135 countries (2008). Its international offices are located in Jeffersonville, Indiana, where it operates a Bible Institute correspondence course based on Hicks&#x27; own works, publishing ministry, broadcast ministry, and audio ministry.

<text>Abū Naṣr Manṣūr ibn ʿAlī ibn ʿIrāq al-Jaʿdī (; c. 960 – 1036) was a Persian Muslim mathematician and astronomer. He is well known for his work with the spherical sine law.

Abu Nasri Mansur was born in Gilan, Persia, to the ruling family of Khwarezm, the Afrighids. He was thus a prince within the political sphere. He was a student of Abu&#x27;l-Wafa and a teacher of and also an important colleague of the mathematician, Al-Biruni. Together, they were responsible for great discoveries in mathematics and dedicated many works to one another.

Most of Abu Nasri&#x27;s work focused on mathematics, but some of his writings were on astronomy. In mathematics, he had many important writings on trigonometry, which were developed from the writings of Ptolemy. He also preserved the writings of Menelaus of Alexandria and reworked many of the Greeks theorems.

He died in the Ghaznavid Empire (modern-day Afghanistan) near the city of Ghazna.

<doc id="439771" wikidata="Q6490518" url="?curid=439771" title="Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney">
<text>[[Larry Holmes]] vs. [[Gerry Cooney]] was a heavyweight boxing match that took place on June 11, 1982, in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. It was one of the most highly anticipated fights of the early 1980s.

==Setup==
Larry Holmes had been the WBC heavyweight champion since 1978, when he beat Ken Norton by a fifteen-round split decision at the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Over the course of his illustrious career, on the way to almost tying the great Rocky Marciano&#x27;s record of 49-0, losing in the 49th fight, a decision to Michael Spinks, fought such fighters as Tim Witherspoon, Earnie Shavers, Mike Weaver, Trevor Berbick, Leon Spinks and, most notably, Muhammad Ali.

Gerry Cooney, on the other hand, had been a professional fighter since 1977, and he was able to beat boxers such as Jimmy Young and others. The turning point of his career came when he beat Ken Norton, in May 1981, by knockout in round one at the Madison Square Garden in New York.

Anticipation over a Holmes-Cooney confrontation began to take shape in early 1981, but the fight took over a year to happen, partly because 1981 in particular was a very busy year for boxing with many other big fights, partly because Holmes was obliged to defend against Berbick, Spinks and Renaldo Snipes in that order. Cooney only had one fight in 1981, against Norton. Holmes-Cooney was originally scheduled for March 1982, but was postponed until June when Cooney injured his back in training.

By 1982, promoter Don King and manager Dennis Rappaport began one of the most massive and racially toned campaigns in boxing history to raise public interest for a fight between Holmes and Cooney. After they were both signed to fight, an intense promotional tour followed. Holmes and Cooney attended press conferences at several United States cities, Cooney was shown on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Hollywood stars took an interest in the fight (Sylvester Stallone in particular hung out with Gerry Cooney, others, such as Woody Allen, attended the fight live) and Cooney was cast as &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;. There had not been a White world Heavyweight champion in 22 years and Cooney would try to change that. White supremacist groups had announced they would have &quot;agents&quot; ready to shoot at Holmes the moment he entered the ring, and Black groups retaliated by answering that they would also have armed people on hand in case Holmes was attacked. Because of this, there were police snipers on the roofs of every major hotel surrounding the venue, once again, the Caesars Palace hotel and casino. Snipers were used because the fight was held in the hotel&#x27;s parking lot; any attacker could have been easily shot by police snipers.

The fight was televised live on closed-circuit and pay-per-view television all over the world. A week after the bout, it was re-broadcast on HBO, and later still, on ABC-TV.

==The fight==
Wilfredo Gómez knocked out Juan Antonio Lopez in ten rounds to retain his WBC super bantamweight title in the semi-final fight, and Holmes and Cooney then took center stage without any incidents. Holmes versus Cooney was refereed by Mills Lane. The announcer that night named Holmes first. Some thought that this was unprecedented; it is tradition in boxing that the challenger be named first and the champion last. The announcement was considered shameful and intensely disrespectful toward the champion Holmes by the boxing community. In fact, when Holmes had challenged Norton for the title, Norton had been introduced first. Moreover, Chuck Hull had introduced Wilfredo Gomez, the defending WBC world Super-Bantamweight champion, before introducing challenger Juan Antonio Lopez, in the bout just prior to the Holmes-Cooney main event that same evening. Nevertheless, when the boxers touched gloves before the first round began, Holmes told Cooney, &quot;Let&#x27;s have a good fight.&quot;

Holmes dropped Cooney in round two, but Cooney got up and landed a damage-causing shot to the body by the end of round four. Holmes and Cooney fought closely from rounds five to eight, trading punches in mid-ring. This was the point where Cooney&#x27;s inactivity started affecting him, however, and Holmes again dropped the championship hopeful in round thirteen, which proved to be the final round. By round ten, Cooney&#x27;s punches began landing low, and this caused him to fall further behind on the judges&#x27; scorecards, with referee Lane deducting three points from him for the infractions.

By round thirteen, Cooney seemed to believe that he would lose the fight and was just trying to last the fifteen round distance. He had suffered a cut on his left eye and was taking heavy punishment. Midway through the round, a Holmes cross landed flush on Cooney&#x27;s left cheek, and Cooney&#x27;s legs buckled. He landed against the ropes, near his corner, and Holmes moved in, intent on finishing his job. Cooney&#x27;s trainer, Victor Valle, prevented him from doing so, however, by throwing a towel from Cooney&#x27;s corner, signifying that they were quitting.

The fight holds the attendance record for a boxing match in Nevada with 29,214 attendees paying a total of $6,239,050.

The fight was close on the judges&#x27; scorecards at the time of the stoppage: Holmes was ahead by a score of 115-109 on judge Jerry Roth&#x27;s card, but only by two points, 113-111, on each Duane Ford and Dave Morettis&#x27; cards, meaning that, technically, after round twelve was over, Cooney still had a chance of winning the fight on points by a split decision.

==Aftermath==
Cooney had a series of problems after this fight, and he fought sporadically until 1990, when he retired for good after being knocked out in two rounds by George Foreman. Holmes, on the other hand, was Heavyweight champion until he lost his belt to Michael Spinks in 1985. He retired from boxing in 1986, but he returned for a fight against Mike Tyson in 1988. A brief retirement after the loss followed until he returned to fight at the age of 41 in 1991, where he fought 21 more matches until his final retirement in 2002.

HBO presented a documentary on the fight as part of its &quot;Legendary Nights&quot; series on memorable boxing bouts.

Holmes and Cooney are now very good friends and Holmes has helped Cooney with Cooney&#x27;s organization, Fighters&#x27; Initiative for Support and Training (FIST), which helps former boxers to obtain other jobs and medical insurance after they retire.

Early in 2020, Holmes and Cooney discussed the idea of meeting in an exhibition fight with the sports writer Brian Niemietz of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, but the idea was dropped following that year&#x27;s COVID-19 pandemic.

==Undercard==
Confirmed bouts:
*Wilfredo Gomez knocked out Juan Antonio Lopez in the 10th round to retain his WBC Super Bantamweight title.
*Trevor Berbick Outpointed Greg Page in a 10-round decision.
*Larry Holmes&#x27; brother Mark Holmes stopped Billy Cage in the third round.
*James Tillis outpointed Earnie Shavers in a 10-round decision.

<text>Mary Angela Docter (born February 11, 1961) is an American speed skater from Madison, Wisconsin. She competed in four Olympic Games (in 1980, 1984, 1988 and 1992), placing sixth in the 3,000 meter in 1980 and 1984.

After the 1988 Olympic Games, she admitted that she got stoned three nights during the week prior to competition. She finished 19th in the 3,000 meters and 11th in the 5,000 meters event.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, after Docter qualified for the 1992 team in three speed-skating events — 1,500, 3,000 and 5,000 meters — she told the media about her drug addiction over the past 10 years, revealing its destructive nature and how she finally confronted the problem by seeking help.

Docter competed in tennis and athletics in high school, and later attended the University of Wisconsin. She is the sister of fellow Olympic athlete Sarah Docter.

BLC&#x27;s education licensure programs are approved by the Minnesota Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board (PELSB).

While the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program is based on standards from the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs, it is not accredited.

==Campus==
Bethany Lutheran College is made up of 15 buildings. Classes are held primarily in five buildings: Meyer Hall, Honsey Hall, Tweit Hall, the Sports and Fitness Center, and the Ylvisaker Fine Arts Center. Many student services are housed in Old Main, including the cafeteria. There are four stand-alone residence halls, and the top three floors of Old Main house an additional residence hall (Anderson Hall). In addition, the campus houses a library, a chapel, the Bethany Activity Center and an advancement building.

== Residential life ==

=== Residency requirement ===
Full-time students are required to live on-campus for their first academic year, unless they are living with parents nearby, are married or have children, or are over 20-years old. Sixty-five percent of all students live on campus.

=== Residence halls ===
Bethany Lutheran College&#x27;s residence halls are separated by gender, with two halls for women and three for men. Visitors are only allowed to visit halls housing opposite-gender students during specific visitation hours. All residence halls include student lounges (including kitchens in non-apartment halls) and free laundry facilities. All residence halls are staffed by residence hall coordinators who live in the residence halls, oversee student resident assistants, and provide student support.

==== Women&#x27;s residence halls ====
Anderson Hall houses freshman through seniors and consists of a variety of dorm room layouts housing one to four students. Edgewood Place houses primarily upper-classmen women and consists of 16 two- and three-bedroom apartments, housing three to six students each. These apartments include full kitchens.

Bethany also produces an alumni magazine titled &quot;Bethany Magazine&quot; which is published three times a year.

=== Clubs and organizations ===
BLC has twenty-four student clubs and organizations, not including their fine-arts activities, athletics, or speech and debate team. Bethany&#x27;s speech and debate team is designated as part of the Communication Department, not a student-led organization.

=== LGBT prohibition ===

Bethany prohibits same-sex relationships and &quot;public promotion&quot; of homosexuality in its standards of conduct for students. This is consistent with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod&#x27;s interpretation of Biblical teachings on the subject.

<doc id="439781" wikidata="Q1125869" url="?curid=439781" title="Christian Congregation in Brazil">
<text>The Christian Congregation in Brazil () was founded in Brazil by the Italian-American missionary Luigi Francescon (1866–1964), as part of the larger Christian Congregation movement.

==History==

Louis Francescon came for the first time to Brazil from Chicago, Illinois in 1910. After arriving in São Paulo, Francescon went to Santo Antonio da Plantina, Paraná. His eleven missionary trips were quite successful among fellow Italian immigrants and Brazilian nationals. The &quot;Christian Congregation of Brazil&quot; is one of the most dynamic and it is fast-growing. In 2016, the Christian Congregation in the Brazil had around 2.8 million members in 2020 and 24,272 temples (2021) in that country and more than 50,000 temples in all world and an intense missionary work abroad. In the metro area of São Paulo, the church shows its strength: there are 500,000 followers, distributed in 2,000 churches and a mother-church in the Brás district that houses a 9,800 member congregation in the Brás district. Francescon was among the early founders of the Italian-American Pentecostal church in Chicago. He had left the First Italian Presbyterian Church of Chicago because of his belief in Water Baptism by immersion. Later, he accepted the doctrines of anointing with oil, miracles, and Holy Spirit baptism at the North Avenue Full Gospel Mission led by William Howard Durham. Evangelists from Chicago went to the Italian colonies in the United States planting churches mostly in the Northeast. Most of those churches were incorporated into the Christian Church of North America, with a few affiliated with the Christian Congregation in the United States.

<doc id="439784" wikidata="Q7330580" url="?curid=439784" title="Richie Sexson">
<text>Richmond Lockwood Sexson (born December 29, 1974) is an American former professional baseball first baseman who played in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee Brewers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Mariners, and New York Yankees from 1997 to 2008. Sexson was a two-time MLB All-Star and was inducted onto the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor. Sexson was also the field manager for the Windy City ThunderBolts in the West division of the Frontier League for the 2023 season.

==Amateur career==
Sexson was born in Portland, Oregon. He attended Prairie High School in Brush Prairie, Washington, and was an All-State performer in baseball, basketball, and football. He also set the school record for the most runs batted in (RBIs) and home runs in a career.

Sexson was offered a scholarship to play both college baseball and college basketball for the Portland Pilots.

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Indians===
The Cleveland Indians selected Sexson in the 24th round (671st overall) of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft. He reached the major leagues in late 1997, playing in five games for Cleveland. Sexson had a breakout year in 1999 with 31 home runs, and 116 RBIs in 134 games.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On July 28, 2000, the Indians traded Sexson to the Milwaukee Brewers in a seven-player deal to get the Indians a closer and two starting pitchers.

In 2001, Sexson hit 45 home runs, which tied the Brewers record set by Gorman Thomas in 1979. His 178 strikeouts also broke the Brewers record, but this was surpassed the following season by José Hernández. On September 25, 2001, Sexson and teammate Jeromy Burnitz each hit three home runs in a 9–4 win against the Arizona Diamondbacks. It was the first and, as of the 2021 season, only time that two players hit three home runs in the same game, let alone two teammates. In 2002, Sexson represented the Brewers in the MLB All-Star Game which was played in Milwaukee. In 2003, he played in all 162 games and again tied the Brewers record of 45 home runs while hitting .272 and earning a selection to the 2003 MLB All-Star Game. Prince Fielder broke Sexson&#x27;s and Thomas&#x27;s team record in 2007, hitting 50 home runs.

Sexson was the first of three players in Brewers history to have 100 or more RBIs in three consecutive seasons along with Fielder in 2007–2009 and Ryan Braun in 2008–10.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
In December 2003, the Brewers traded Sexson along with pitcher Shane Nance and a player to be named later (Noochie Varner) to the Arizona Diamondbacks for infielders Junior Spivey, Craig Counsell, Lyle Overbay, catcher Chad Moeller, and pitchers Chris Capuano and Jorge de la Rosa. On April 26, Sexson hit his 200th career home run an estimated 503 feet off Cubs pitcher Francis Beltrán. Sexson missed most of the rest of the 2004 season after twice suffering a reverse subluxation of his left shoulder while attempting to check his swing.

===Seattle Mariners===
Prior to the 2005 season, Sexson signed a four-year contract with the Seattle Mariners worth $50 million. Sexson played well in the 2005 season, hitting 39 home runs and 121 RBIs and put up similar numbers the following year, hitting 34 home runs and 107 RBIs. However, Sexson struggled mightily in the 2007 season, batting .205 with 21 home runs and 63 RBIs, and again in the 2008 season, hitting just .218 with 11 home runs and 30 RBIs for Seattle.
On May 8, 2008, in a game against the Texas Rangers, Sexson charged the mound towards Rangers starting pitcher Kason Gabbard and threw his batting helmet at him after Gabbard threw a head-high pitch over the middle of the plate, to which Sexson reacted as if it had hit him. Sexson later stated he was frustrated and had a lot going on in his head, including his son being in the hospital and his club&#x27;s recent struggles. He was suspended six games for the incident. He later appealed the suspension, and it was dropped to five games.

On July 10, 2008, Sexson was released by the Mariners.

===New York Yankees===
On July 18, 2008, Sexson signed with the New York Yankees. Sexson did well in his Yankee debut, by collecting his first hit as a Yankee in the first inning with a single and also bringing in Bobby Abreu for the first run that inning. He went 1–3 with one RBI, one walk, and one strikeout. His only home run (a grand slam) as a New York Yankee came on August 5, 2008, against the Texas Rangers. Sexson was designated for assignment on August 15, 2008, after batting .250 with one home run in 22 games for New York. He was released on August 24, 2008.

=== Windy City ThunderBolts ===
On October 20, 2022, Sexson was announced as the new field manager of the Windy City ThunderBolts. This was the first professional managerial position for Sexson after coaching at Summit High School in Bend, Oregon. Sexson&#x27;s first coaching staff hire was Chris Coleman as the third base coach and infield coordinator. He led the team to a 43–52 record (.453 winning percentage), and stepped down from his role at the conclusion of the 2023 season.

==Personal life==
In May 2005, Sexson pleaded guilty in Clark County, Washington, to second degree negligent driving after initially being charged with drunk driving. He was ordered to pay a $538 fine. Since 2014, he has been a baseball coach at Summit High School in Bend, Oregon.

<doc id="439791" wikidata="Q80053" url="?curid=439791" title="Tabriz">
<text>Tabriz (; ; ) is a city in the Central District of Tabriz County, in the East Azerbaijan province of northwestern Iran. It serves as capital of the province, the county, and the district. It is the sixth-most-populous city in Iran.

Tabriz is in the Quru River valley in Iran&#x27;s historic Azerbaijan region between long ridges of volcanic cones in the Sahand and Eynali mountains. Tabriz&#x27;s elevation ranges between above sea level. The valley opens up into a plain that gently slopes down to the eastern shores of Lake Urmia, to the west. The city was named World Carpet Weaving City by the World Crafts Council in October 2015 and Exemplary Tourist City of 2018 by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

With a population of over 1.7 million (2016), Tabriz is the largest economic hub and metropolitan area in northwest Iran. The population is bilingual with most people speaking Azerbaijani as their native language and Persian as their second language. Tabriz is a major heavy industries hub for automobiles, machine tools, refineries, petrochemicals, textiles and cement production industries. The city is famous for its handicrafts, including hand-woven rugs and jewelry. Local confectionery, chocolate, dried nuts and traditional Tabrizi food are recognized throughout Iran as some of the best. Some of the most esteemed cultural institutions in northwest Iran are located in Tabriz, which is also a center for intellectual activity.

Tabriz contains many historical monuments, representing Iran&#x27;s architectural transition throughout its long history. Most of Tabriz&#x27;s preserved historical sites belong to Ilkhanid, Safavid and Qajar. Among these sites is the grand Bazaar of Tabriz, which is designated a World Heritage Site. From the early modern era, Tabriz was pivotal in the development of its three neighboring regions; namely the Caucasus, Eastern Anatolia and Central Iran. As the country&#x27;s closest hub to Europe, many aspects of early modernization in Iran began in Tabriz. The Qajar dynasty was forced to cede the Caucasian territories to Imperial Russia following the two Russo-Persian Wars in the first half of the 19th century. Until 1925, the city was the traditional residence of the Qajar crown princes.

== Etymology ==

According to some sources, including &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the name &quot;Tabriz&quot; derives from &quot;tap-riz&quot;, meaning &quot;flowing hot&quot;, in reference to the area&#x27;s many thermal springs.

Other sources claim that in AD 246, to avenge his brother&#x27;s death, king Tiridates II of Armenia repelled Ardashir I of the Sassanid Empire and changed the name of the city from Shahistan to Tauris, deriving from in Grabar &quot;ta-vrezh&quot; &quot;this revenge&quot;. In AD 297, it became the capital of Tiridates III, king of Armenia. However, this story is of popular origin and based on accounts of Vardan Areveltsi, a 13th-century Armenian historian; no ancient source records such an event. The historical Armenian name for the city was Tavrezh ().

&quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot; points to a connection between the &quot;ancient stronghold of Tarui-Tarmakisa&quot; (or Tarwi-Tarwakisa), which existed in the 8th century BC, and the city of Tabriz; Ernst Emil Herzfeld&#x27;s &quot;Archaeological History of Iran&quot; directly equates &quot;Tarwakisa&quot; with Tabriz (cf Proto-Iranian &quot;&quot; &quot;able to overcome&quot;). However, some researchers believe that Tabriz may be considered a pre-Iranian toponym.

== History ==
===Early history===
The early history of Tabriz is not well documented. The earliest civilization signs in the city belongs to an Iron Age grave yard of 1st millennium B.C. which were unearthed in late 1990s in northern side of Blue Mosque. The city also inscribed as old as 714 B.C. on as Tarui or Tauris, on the Assyrian King Sargon II&#x27;s epigraph in 714 B.C.

Egyptologist David Rohl suggested that the legendary Garden of Eden was near Tabriz. Archaeologist Eric H. Cline commented on Rohl&#x27;s views, writing that &quot;his suggestions have not caught on with the scholarly establishment. His argument is not helped by the fact that it depends upon speculations regarding the transmission of place-names for both the various rivers and nearby related areas from antiquity to the present. In the end, while Rohl&#x27;s suggestion is not out of the question, it seems no more probable than any other hypothesis, and less likely than those suggested by Speiser, Zarins, and Sauer.&quot;

Since the earliest documented history of Tabriz, it has been chosen as the capital for several rulers commencing from Atropates era and his dynasty. It is likely the city has been destroyed multiple times either by natural disasters or by the invading armies. The earliest elements of the present Tabriz are claimed to be built either at the time of the early Sassanids in the 3rd or 4th century AD, or later in the 7th century. The city used to be called &quot;T&#x27;awrēš&quot; in Middle Persian.

=== From the Arab conquest to the Constitutional Revolution ===

After the Muslim conquest of Iran, the Arabian Azd tribe from Yemen resided in Tabriz. The development of post-Islamic Tabriz began as of this time. The Islamic geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi says that Tabriz was a village before Rawwad from the tribe of Azd arrive at Tabriz. In 791 AD, Zubaidah, the wife of Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, rebuilt Tabriz after a devastating earthquake and beautified the city so much as to obtain the credit for having been its founder.

In the Ramadan of 1208, Tabriz, as well as its adjacent cities and territories were conquered by the Kingdom of Georgia under Tamar the Great, as a response to the massacre of 12,000 Christians in the Georgian-controlled city of Ani on Easter day by Muslims. In nearby Ardebil, conquered by the Georgians as well, as many as 12,000 Muslims were killed. The Georgians then pushed further, taking Khoy and Qazvin along the way.

After the Mongol invasion, Tabriz came to eclipse Maragheh as the later Ilkhanid Mongol capital of Azerbaijan until it was sacked by Timur in 1392.

Chosen as a capital by Abaqa Khan, fourth ruler of the Ilkhanate, for its favored location in the northwestern grasslands, in 1295, his successor Ghazan Khan made it the chief administrative centre of an empire stretching from Anatolia to the Oxus River and from the Caucasus to the Indian Ocean. Under his rule, new walls were built around the city, and numerous public buildings, educational facilities, and caravansarais were erected to serve traders travelling on the ancient Silk Road. The Byzantine Gregory Chioniades is said to have served as the city&#x27;s Orthodox bishop during this time.

In the 10th century, Ardabil briefly held the status of Azarbayjan&#x27;s capital, only to be swiftly supplanted by Tabriz, situated 130 miles to the west. Tabriz swiftly rose to prominence as a pivotal commercial hub, facilitating trade between the Far East, Central Asia, and vital routes. It served as a nexus linking Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean, Anatolia, Constantinople, and extending northward through the Caucasus to the Ukraine, Crimea, and Eastern Europe.
In the 13th century, many western expediters who visited Tabriz on their way to the east were amazed by the richness of the city, its magnificent buildings and its institutions.

Marco Polo travelled the Silk Road, passing Tabriz about 1275, described it as: &quot;a great city surrounded by beautiful and pleasant gardens. It is excellently situated so the goods brought to here coming from many regions. Latin merchants specially Genevis go there to buy the goods that come from foreign lands.&quot;

From 1375 to 1468, Tabriz was the capital of Qara Qoyunlu state in Azerbaijan, until defeat of Qara Qoyunlu ruler, Jahan Shah by Ag Qoyunlu warriors. Ag Qoyunlus selected Tabriz as their capital from 1469 to 1501. Some of the existing historical monuments including the Blue Mosque belong to the Qara Qoyunlu period.

In 1501, Ismail I entered Tabriz and proclaimed it the capital of his Safavid state. In 1514, after the Battle of Chaldiran, Tabriz was sacked by Selim I. On 16 July 1534, prior to Ottoman conquest of Baghdad, Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha occupied Tabriz. In 1555, Tahmasp I transferred its capital to Qazvin to avoid the growing threat of the Ottoman army to his capital.

Between 1585 and 1603, Tabriz was under occupation by Ottomans. After it was retaken by the Safavids under Abbas the Great, the city grew as a major commerce centre, conducting trade with the Ottoman Empire, Russia, and the Caucasus. Tabriz was occupied and sacked by Ottoman Murad IV in 1635, during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39), before being returned to Iran in the Treaty of Zohab in 1639. The city was completely devastated by a strong earthquake in 1641.

In summer of 1721, a large earthquake shocked Tabriz, killing about eighty thousand of its residents. The devastation continued in 1724–1725, when the city was invaded by an Ottoman army. During this round of invasion, the Ottomans imprisoned many in Tabriz and killed about two hundred thousand residents. The city was subsequently retaken by the Iranian army, after which a widespread famine, combined with the spread of fatal diseases, killed more of those who still remained. In addition, another earthquake is disputed to have occurred in 1727 further adding to the region&#x27;s instability at the time. In 1780, a major earthquake hit near Tabriz and killed as many as two hundred thousand people, leaving only about thirty thousand survivors.

At the end of the 18th century, the city was divided into several districts, each ruled by a family, until 1799, when the Qajar Prince Abbas Mirza was appointed as the governor of the city. During the Qajar Empire the city was the residence for the crown prince. The crown prince normally served as governor of Azerbaijan province as well. Some of the most important events in this period were the wars between Qajar Iran and neighbouring Imperial Russia. Prior to the forced cession of Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories—comprising what is now Georgia, southern Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia—to Imperial Russia following the two Russo-Persian Wars of the first half of the 19th century, Tabriz, being strategically located, was instrumental to the implementation of Iranian rule in its Caucasian territories. During the last Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), the city was captured for Russia in 1828 by General Prince Eristov, who marched into the city with 3,000 soldiers. After Abbas Mirza and Ivan Paskevich signed the peace treaty, which granted for the irrevocable cession of the last remaining Caucasian territories, the Russian army retreated from the city. Nevertheless, Russian political and military influence remained a major force in Tabriz and north-northwestern Iran even until the fall of the Russian empire in the early 20th century. After the retreat of the Russian army, Abbas Mirza, the Qajar Crown Prince, launched a modernization scheme from Tabriz, during which he introduced Western-style institutions, imported industrial machinery, installed the first regular postal service, and undertook military reforms in the city. He also began a rebuilding campaign and established a modern taxation system.

=== Contemporary era ===
Thanks to the geographical closeness to the West and to communications with nearby countries&#x27; enlightenment movements, Tabriz became the centre of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution movements between 1905 and 1911, which led to the establishment of a parliament in Iran and the formation of a constitution. Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan, two Tabrizi reformists who led Tabriz people&#x27;s solidarity against the absolute monarchy, had a great role in achievement to the goals of Iran&#x27;s constitutional revolution. In 1909, Tabriz was occupied by the Russian forces. Four months after the constitutional revolution&#x27;s success, in December 1911, the Russians reinvaded Tabriz. After crushing the local resistance by invading Russian troops, they started suppressing the constitutional revolutionaries and residents of the city. Following the invasion, Russian troops executed about 1,200 of Tabriz residents. As a result of the campaign, Tabriz was occupied by the Russian forces between 1911 and 1917.
From the very start of World War I, Iran declared neutrality. When the war erupted on a full scale, Tabriz and much of northwestern-northern Iran had already been &quot;de facto&quot; occupied by Russia for several years. In later years of World War I, the Ottoman troops intervened and took control of the city by defeating the Russian troops stationed there. By this time, the Ottoman army led by Enver Pasha threatened the whole Russian army in the Caucasus region. Russian troops recaptured the city from the Ottomans at a later stage of the war. By escalation of the revolution in Russia, the Russian armies in Iranian Azerbaijan were evacuated, and the actual power passed into the hands of the local committee of the democrat party, with Ismail Nawbari at its head. Following Russia&#x27;s retreat, the Ottomans captured the city once again for a few months until the decisive end of the war, and retreated thereafter. After World War I, a new era in the county&#x27;s history began. Reza Pahlavi, brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, declared himself the king of the country following a coup d&#x27;état. He started with promises of modernization programs in Iran which was concentrated on the unification of the country, under the idea of &quot;one country, one nation&quot;. This included centralization of the power and imposing restrictions on the local culture, heritage, and language in Iranian Azerbaijan, and the city of Tabriz. The modernization and nationalization plan of Reza Shah continued until the surge of World War II.

At the final year of the World War II despite the declaration of the neutrality by the Iranian government, the country was occupied by the allied forces. The allied forces then urged Reza Pahlavi to abdicate and installed his son Mohammad Reza as the new king of the country. The postwar situation was further complicated by Soviet aid to set up a local government called Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government in Northwest Iran, having Tabriz as its capital. The new Soviet-backed local government was run by Ja&#x27;far Pishevari and held power for one year starting from 1946. Pishevari&#x27;s government gave more freedom to speech and education in Azerbaijani language and promoted local cultural heritage and gained some popularity among the residents. However, after the withdrawal of Soviet forces, Pishevari&#x27;s limited armed forces were crushed by the Imperial Iranian army and the Iranian government retook control of the city. One of the major establishments in the period of Pishevari&#x27;s government was opening of the University of Tabriz which played a major role in the later political movements and protests in the region.
For the next 30 years, after the collapse of Azerbaijan&#x27;s autonomous government, Tabriz enjoyed a stable era until the revolution in 1979. During this period the city received significant investment in its industries and transformed into a heavy-industry hub in the northwestern Iran. The need for a strong workforce increased immigration from all around Azerbaijan toward Tabriz. During this era and because of the continuous policy of the government centralization in Tehran as well as changes in communication and transportation, the city lost its historical dominance, but turned into the gate for reform and modernization of the country.

Starting with 1978 and with the heat of the Iranian Revolution, revolutionary movements of some of Tabriz residents played a major role in the revolution. After the revolution, the residents of the city were unsatisfied with the outcome, mainly because of the ignorance of the revolutionary government about the rights of the Azerbaijani minority. Another major source of dissatisfaction was the support of most of Iranian Azerbaijanis including Tabriz residents from a more liberal cleric, Grand Ayatollah Shariatmadari, who was against the content of the new constitution which was mixing religion and state together. The unrest in the city calmed down after brutal crush of the protesters in Tabriz and after house arrest of Shariatmadari.

In the 1980s, due to the Iran–Iraq War, like the rest of the country, most of the construction and development projects in the city were stopped in order to fund the war costs. In addition to the indirect effects of the war, city&#x27;s industrial zone, especially the oil refinery was also a major target for airstrikes by Iraqi&#x27;s air forces because of the closeness to the Iraqi borderlines, and their strategic roles in the country&#x27;s economy. With the escalation of the war, the attacks turned to War of the Cities and the air attacks later turned into the random strikes on the residential areas of the city in the later phase of the war.

In recent years, Tabriz is much more stable and the new developments in the city are rapidly changing the face of the city.

===Capital of dynasties, empires, and kingdoms before modern day===
Tabriz was chosen as the capital by several rulers commencing from the time of Atropates. It was the capital of the Ilkhanate (Mongol) dynasty since 1265. During the Ghazan Khan era, who came into power in 1295, the city reached its highest splendour. The later realm stretched from the Amu Darya in the East to the Egypt borders in the West and from the Caucasus in the North to the Indian Ocean in the South. It was again the capital of Iran during the Qara Qoyunlu dynasty from 1375 to 1468 and then during the Ag Qoyunlu within 1468–1500 and it was capital of Iran in the Safavid period from 1501 until their defeat in 1555.

During the Qajar dynasty, Tabriz was used as residence centre of Iranian Crown Prince (1794–1925).

=== Excavation sites ===
In 2002, during a construction project at the north side of the Blue Mosque (Part of Silk Road Project), an ancient graveyard was revealed. This was kept secret until a construction worker alerted the authorities. Radiocarbon analysis by Allameh Tabatabai University has shown the background of the graves to be more than 3,800 years old. A museum of these excavations including the Blue Mosque was opened to the public in 2006.

The other excavation site is in Abbasi Street at the site of Rab&#x27;-e Rashidi, which was the location for an academic institution since approximately 700 years ago. It was established in Ilkhanid period.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
The predominant language spoken in Tabriz is Azerbaijani language (Azerbaijani people call it &quot;Turku&quot; (&quot;تۆرکۆ&quot;) or &quot;Turki&quot; (تۆرکی) language), which is a Turkic language mutually intelligible with modern Turkish dialects. The language has a strong Iranian superstratum since it has been in close contact with the Persian language for many centuries. Similar to the other parts of Iran, the official language is Persian and the most inhabitants have native or near-native knowledge of Persian language, which is the major medium of education. Nevertheless, the Iranian constitution respects the right to speak and have limited educational facilities in other native languages, including Azerbaijani. For the first time, an academic program on Azerbaijani language opened at the University of Tabriz in 1999. Other than Azerbaijani, there is a notable minority of Armenian speakers and a smaller minority of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic speakers.

It is believed that before the gradual increase and the dominance of Azerbaijani language in the area, other Iranian languages similar to Persian were spoken in Azerbaijan and Tabriz. The 13th-century manuscript Safina-yi Tabriz has poems in what its Tabriz-born author has called the Tabrizi language (&quot;Zabān-e-Tabrizi&quot;) which is similar to Persian.

=== Religion ===
After being crowned at Tabriz in 1501, Shah Ismail I announced the Twelver branch of Shia Islam as the official religion of the Safavid Empire. As a result of this royal order, the mostly Sunni population of Tabriz was force converted to Shiism. Currently, the majority of people are followers of Shia Islam.

The city has a visible Armenian Apostolic minority who follow Christianity. There used to be a small Jewish community, but most of them have moved to Tehran. There is also a small, embattled community of the Baháʼí Faith in the city.

===Population===
The Iranian national census was first completed in 1956 and published decennially until 2006, when, thereafter, the Statistical Center of Iran began to conduct them every five years. The 1976 census notes a total population more than double of the decade before, a result of rural to urban migration during the White Revolution. At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 1,378,931 in 378,329 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,495,452 people in 455,494 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 1,558,693 people in 497,898 households. The majority of the city&#x27;s population are Azerbaijani people, followed by Persians, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, and other People of Caucasus.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
Tabriz is located in northwest of Iran in East Azerbaijan province between Eynali and Sahand mountains in a fertile area inshore of Aji River and Quri River.
The local area is earthquake-prone and during its history, the city has been devastated and rebuilt several times.

=== Climate ===
Tabriz has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BS&quot;) bordering on a humid continental climate with hot summers (Köppen: &quot;Dsa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Dc&quot;). The annual precipitation is around , a good deal of which falls as snow during the winter months and rain in spring and autumn. The city enjoys a mild and fine climate in spring and autumn, is hot and dry in summer, while snowy and cold in winter. The average annual temperature is . Cool winds blow from east to west, mostly in summer.

Jean Chardin, a French traveler, visited Tabriz during the Safavid era, noting the climate in Tabriz in his travel logs: &quot;Cold weather exists for most of the year. Since the city is northerly, snow exists on the peaks of its mountains for nine months out of the year. The wind blows during mornings and nights, while rain showers form in all seasons except summer. The weather is relatively cloudy the entire year.&quot;

Highest recorded temperature: on 26 July 1966&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 20 January 1964
=== Environment pollution ===
Air pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Tabriz. Air pollution is due to an increase of the number of cars commuting in the city and polluting industries such as thermal power plants, petrochemical complexes and the oil refinery in the west of the city. Air pollution levels increased continuously in the second half of the 20th century. With a mandate of national environmental codes by heavy industries, industrial air pollution has reduced in recent years. However, the air quality in the city is far from world norms for clean air.

An immediate environmental threat is the shrinkage and drying out of the Lake Urmia located in the outskirts of Western Tabriz. The lake has faced a grave crisis since the late 20th century. Water depth reduction, increasing water salinity to saturation level and the appearance of vast salt fields around the lake, are alarming indications of gradual total desiccation of a unique ecosystem. This occurred due to global warming and ever-increasing demands for inadequate freshwater sources in the basin. It is feared that in the near future low-lying clouds of airborne salt and minerals may hover over large areas around the lake, posing serious health hazards.

== Governance ==

Authority for the city lies with the Mayor, who is elected by a municipal board. The municipal board is periodically elected by the city&#x27;s residents. The Municipal central office is located in the Tabriz Municipality Palace.

=== Literature ===
&lt;poem&gt;Sahand, o mountain of pure snow,
Descended from Heaven with Zoroaster
Fire in your heart, snow on your shoulders,
with storm of centuries,
And white hair of history on your chest ...&lt;/poem&gt;

Yadollah Maftun Amini (born in 1926)

The city of Tabriz, historically located at the westernmost end of Iran&#x27;s trade route and situated along the Silk Road, has long been a hub of commerce as well as culture and art. This strategic position facilitated both economic prosperity and the flourishing of cultural exchanges. In the modern era, the establishment of Memorial School in the late 19th century, followed by the founding of the University of Tabriz, along with the presence of intellectual movements, further boosted the city&#x27;s cultural development.

Tabriz is also the birthplace of one of Iran&#x27;s most prominent schools of painting, known as the &quot;Tabriz School.&quot; This artistic movement flourished during the periods of the Ilkhanate, Jalayirids, Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu, and Safavid dynasties, leaving a lasting impact on Iranian art.

The proximity to Sahand, a mountain in the south of the city, has been a source of inspiration for contemporary revolutionaries and poets alike. The power of this inspiring source, however, goes to much earlier times. Tabriz was a house for numerous Iranian writers, poets, and illumination movements. In old times the city notables supported poets and writers by organizing periodical meetings. Within its long history, it was a residence for many well known Iranian writers and poets. The list can start from the old-time Rumi, Qatran, Khaqani to recent years Samad Behrangi, Gholam-Hossein Sa&#x27;edi, Parvin E&#x27;tesami. The prominent Iranian Azerbaijani poet Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar was born in Tabriz. The culture, social values, language and music is a mixture of what exists in the rest of Iran.

Tabriz also has a special place in Persian literature, as the following sample of verses from some of Iran&#x27;s best poets and authors illustrates:


ساربانا بار بگشا ز اشتران
شهر تبريز است و کوی دلبران

Oh Sārbān, have the camels&#x27; cargo unloaded,
This is Tabriz, the neighborhood of the beloved ones.
―&quot;Molana&quot;

عزیزی در اقصای تبریز بود
که همواره بیدار و شبخیز بود

A beloved lived in Tabriz away from sight,
who was always alert and awake at night
―&quot;Bustan of Sadi&quot;

تا به تبریزم دو چیزم حاصل است
نیم نان و آب مهران رود و بس

As long as I live in Tabriz, two things I need not worry about,
The half loaf of bread and the water of Mehranrud [river] are enough!
―&quot;Khaqani&quot;

اين ارك بلند شهر تبريز است
افراشته قامتِ رسايش را

This is the tall Arg of Tabriz City,
Raised its outstanding height there!
―&quot;Maftun&quot;

=== Music ===
A century-long autocratic nation-building policy of central governments in Iran has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favour of a government-sanctioned culture. As a result, Tabriz, by the turn of the 20th century had nearly become devoid of its once characteristic cultural identity. Thanks to the more liberal policies of the Khatami era (1998–2006), a cultural renaissance took place and the local music was revitalized.

The traditional Azerbaijani music is divided into two distinct types, the music of &quot;ashugh&quot; and the &quot;mugham&quot;. Mugham, despite its similarity to Persian classical music, was not common among Iranian Azerbaijanis. In recent years, however, mugham is gaining popularity among the educated middle-class young generation. For instance, Nasir Atapur, from Tabriz, was the laureate of Mugam contest 2007.

The ashugh music had survived in a mountainous region of Qaradağ and presently is identified as the characteristic form of music in all Azerbaijan. The ashugh music, throughout its long history, had been associated with nomadic life in mountainous regions and used to be dismissed as back-country folklore. The recent identity renaissance of Azerbaijani speaking people has elevated the status of Ashughs as the guardians of national culture. The newfound unprecedented popularity and frequent concerts and performances in urban settings have resulted in rapid innovative developments aiming to enhance the urban-appealing aspects of these ashugh performances. The main factor for these developments was the opening of academic style music classes in Tabriz by master Ashugs, such as Aşiq Imran Heydəri.

Ashugs (Aşiq in Azerbaijani language stemmed from the Arabic word for lover) were travelling bards who sang and played saz, an eight or ten string plucking instrument in the form of a long-necked lute. Their roots can be traced back to at least the 7th century according to the Turkic epic Dede Korkut. Naturally, the music has evolved in the course of the grand migration and ensuing feuds with the original inhabitants the acquired lands. Still, the essence of the original epics, i.e. metamorphic description of life in pastoral terms with direct reference to the mountainous landscape, persists to the present time. The characteristic aspect of the Ashugh music is its frequent allusions to a mountain with the intention of arousing an emotional state with a tone of mild melancholy in a listener. The first verses of a contemporary Ashug song, composed by Məhəmməd Araz, may well represent the essence of Ashugh music may clarify the said statement.

&quot;Bəlkə bu yerlərə birdə gəlmədim&quot; (I may not come to these mountains again)

&quot;duman səlamət qal dağ səlamət qal&quot; (Farewell to the Mist and to the mountain)

&quot;arxamca su səpir göydə bulutlar&quot; (Clouds sprinkle drops of rain)

&quot;leysan səlamət qal yağ səlamət qal&quot; (Farewell to summer days, farewell to the rain)

=== Painting ===

&quot;Tabrizian style&quot; painting was shaped in the era of Ilkhanids, Kara Koyunlu and the Safavids. The paintings date back to the early 14th century and show significant influence from Chinese and Chinese-influenced pictures. Over the years Tabriz became the centre of the noteworthy school of Persian miniature painting. A fictional account of &quot;Tabrizian style&quot; painting in the Safavids era is narrated by Orhan Pamuk in &quot;My Name Is Red&quot;.

=== Cuisine ===

Famous dishes in Tabriz include:

&quot;Aash&quot; is a kind of soup prepared with bouillon, various vegetables, carrots, noodles and spices.

&quot;Abgoosht&quot; or &quot;Shorva&quot; () is a hearty soup made of mutton and chickpeas. It has been cooked in Iran for many years and, until recently, was the main dish of most families in Tabriz.

&quot;Chelow kabab&quot;, kebab and roasted tomatoes (and roasted hot peppers occasionally) served on a plate of steamed rice&quot;,&quot; is the national dish of Iran. Tabriz is famous for the quality of its &quot;chelow kabab&quot;.

&quot;Dolma&quot; is a traditional food, prepared by filling an eggplant, capsicum, tomato or zucchini with a mixture of meat, split pea, onion and various spices.

&quot;Garniyarikh&quot; (meaning &quot;the torn abdomen&quot; in Azerbaijani) is a kind of dolma filled with meat, garlic, almonds and spices.

&quot;Tabriz meatballs&quot; are large meatballs composed of ground meat, rice, and leeks, alongside various other ingredients. The word &quot;kofta&quot; is derived from Persian &quot;kūfta&quot;: in Persian, &quot;kuftan&quot; (کوفتن) means &quot;to beat&quot; or &quot;to grind&quot;.
There are also confections, biscuits and cookies which are Tabriz specialties, including Qurabiya, Tabrizi Lovuez, Riss, Nougat, Tasbihi, Latifeh, Ahari, Lovadieh, and Lokum.
==Main sights==

<text>A mechane (; , &quot;mēkhanḗ&quot;) or machine was a crane used in Greek theatre, especially in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Made of wooden beams and pulley systems, the device was used to lift an actor into the air, usually representing flight. This stage machine was particularly used to bring gods onto the stage from above, hence the Latin term &quot;deus ex machina&quot; (&quot;god from the machine&quot;). Euripides&#x27; use of the mechane in &quot;Medea&quot; (431 BC) is a notable use of the machine for a non-divine character. It was also often used by Aeschylus.

==Use in ancient Rome==
Stage machines were also used in ancient Rome, e.g. during the sometimes highly dramatic performances at funerals. For Julius Caesar&#x27;s funeral service, Appian reports a mechane that was used to present a blood-stained wax effigy of the deceased dictator to the funeral crowd. The mechane was used to turn the body in all directions. Geoffrey Sumi proposes that the use of the mechane &quot;hinted at Caesar&#x27;s divinity.&quot; This is highly unlikely because Appian doesn&#x27;t describe the mechane as a genuine &quot;deus-ex-machina&quot; device. Furthermore Caesar&#x27;s apotheosis wasn&#x27;t legally conducted until 42 BC and Caesar had only been worshipped unofficially as &quot;divus&quot; during his lifetime. First and foremost, Marcus Antonius attempted to arouse the masses as a means to strengthen Caesar&#x27;s esteem as well as his own political power.

==Religious significance==
In Christian liturgy the mechane has also been identified with the cross. Ignatius calls the cross the &quot;theatre mechane&quot; of Jesus Christ.

<text>Mysidae is the largest family of crustaceans in the order Mysida, with over 1000 species in around 170 genera.

==Characteristics==
Members of the family Mysidae are distinguished from other mysids by the fact that the first pereopod (walking leg) has a well-developed exopod (outer branch), the carpopropodus of the endopod (inner branch) of the 3rd to 8th pereopods is divided into sub-segments and there are statocysts on the endopod of the uropods (posterior appendages). Female petalophthalmidans have two or three oostegites (flexible bristly flaps) forming the base of the marsupium or brood pouch under the thorax, apart from the subfamily Boreomysinae, which has seven pairs of oostegites.

==Subfamilies and genera==

<text>Temasek (also spelt Temasik or Tumasik) is an early recorded name of a settlement on the site of modern Singapore. The name appears in early Malay and Javanese literature, and it is also recorded in Yuan and Ming Chinese documents as &quot;Danmaxi&quot; ( or ). Two distinct settlements were recorded in Temasek – Long Ya Men (Malay: &quot;Batu Berlayar&quot;) and Ban Zu (Malay: &quot;Pancur&quot;). Temasek is used in modern-day Singapore for national honours as well as institutions and corporations.

==Name==
The origin of the name Temasek was derived from the Malay word &quot;tasik&quot; meaning &quot;lake&quot; or &quot;sea&quot;, and may mean here &quot;place surrounded by the sea&quot;, or Sea Town. Another suggestion is that it may be a reference to a king of Srivijaya, Maharaja &quot;Tan ma sa na ho&quot;. The name appears as &quot;Tumasik&quot; in the Old Javanese eulogy written in 1365, Nagarakretagama, which basically the word &quot;tasik&quot; &quot;sea&quot; infixed by &quot;-um-&quot; (active verb infix). The name is also mentioned twice in the &quot;Malay Annals&quot; and referred to in the Javanese work &quot;Pararaton&quot;. Temasek is described in the account by the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan who visited the island around 1330 and wrote about a Malay settlement called &quot;Danmaxi&quot;, a transcription of the name Temasek. In a version of Marco Polo&#x27;s account of his travel, a place named &quot;Chiamassie&quot; that could be Temasik was mentioned in relation to the island kingdom of &quot;Malayur&quot;. Temasek may have also been mentioned in Vietnamese records as &quot;Sach Ma Tich&quot; in the 14th century.

George Hendrik Werndly, writing in 1736, provided another explanation of Temasek’s origin and meaning. Citing Petrus van der Vorm, he suggested that it was an Arabic expression Tamasûkh ( تمسوق ), a composite of tama (تم), and sûkh ( سوق ), meaning “market”, “marketplace”, or “place of purchase”. Tamasûkh was a play on Ujong Tanah (“end of land”), which aptly describes Singapore’s special position at the end of both the Malay Peninsula, as well as an imaginary line conceived by navigators to divide the Indian Ocean between the “lands above the wind”–that is India and the Middle East–and the “lands below the wind”–the islands of the Malay Archipelago. 
Sometime in the 14th century, the name Temasek was replaced by Singapura, a Malay name derived from Sanskrit meaning &quot;Lion City&quot;. Legend has it that the name was given by Sang Nila Utama when he visited the island in 1299 and saw an unknown creature, which he was informed was a lion. Although Chinese records continued to use the name Temasek for some time afterwards (for example in the Mao Kun map) and it was also used in The &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, the name Temasek had become obsolete and did not appear in European maps and documents from 1500 to 1800. It was revived in colonial and more modern times, and is now used as names for institutions, corporations and national honours in Singapore.

==History==
While the early history of Singapore is obscured by myth and legend, some conclusions can be drawn from archaeological evidence and from written references by travellers. Archaeology points to an urbanised settlement on the site by the 14th century. At its height, the city boasted a large earthen city wall and moat; many of the buildings were built with stone and brick foundations. Remains of old pottery, coins, jewellery and other artefacts have been found, with many of these artefacts believed to be imported from various parts of China, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. These are sometimes seen as evidence of the city&#x27;s status as a regional trade centre. An aquatic route, part of the larger Silk route, passed through Temasek.

From the 7th to the 11th centuries, the island of Singapore was controlled by the Srivijaya empire based in Sumatra. Diplomatic relationships between Temasek and Vietnam may have begun in the 13th century. Temasek was a fortified city and trading centre in the 14th century. It was recorded that during the Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to &quot;Long Ya Men&quot; (&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth Gate&quot;, thought to be the entrance of Keppel Harbour) in 1320 to obtain tame elephants. The people of &quot;Long Ya Men&quot; then returned in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. In around 1330, the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan visited the island and mentioned two distinct settlements in Temasek: &quot;Long Ya Men&quot; and &quot;Ban Zu&quot; (a transcription of the Malay name &quot;pancur&quot; meaning a &quot;spring&quot;). In his work &quot;Daoyi Zhilüe&quot;, Wang described &quot;Long Ya Men&quot; as the two hills of Temasek that looked like &quot;Dragon&#x27;s teeth&quot; between which a strait runs, and wrote:
Wang further mentioned that lakawood and tin were products there and the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, but Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (西洋) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). The description of the people may be the first known record of the Orang Laut who inhabited the region.

&quot;Ban Zu&quot; was described as being sited on a hill, thought to be today&#x27;s Fort Canning Hill, located behind &quot;Long Ya Men&quot;. In contrast to those of &quot;Long Ya Men&quot; who were prone to acts of piracy, the inhabitants here were described as honest. They also &quot;wear their hair short, with turban of gold-brocaded satin&quot;, and red-coloured clothing. Ruins of the settlement on the hill were still visible in the early 19th century and was described by the Resident John Crawfurd. In 1928, several pieces of gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century were discovered at Fort Canning Hill. Wang also reported that the Siamese attacked the city moat of Temasek with around 70 ships a few years before he visited, and the city successfully resisted the attack for a month.

By the 14th century, the Srivijaya empire had declined, and the Majapahit and Ayutthaya Kingdom became dominant in the region and alternatively made claim to Temasek. The Nagarakretagama written in 1365 listed Tumasik as a vassal of the Majapahit. Portuguese sources indicate that during the late 14th century, Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara from Palembang. Parameswara was driven from Palembang by the Javanese after Parameswara challenged the Majapahit by setting up a lion throne that symbolised a revival of Palembang&#x27;s claim over the Srivijaya empire. According to a Portuguese account, Parameswara fled to Temasek, and eight days later killed the local chief with the title Sang Aji, named Sangesinga in a later account. It has been proposed that Temasek changed its name to &quot;Singapura&quot; in this period rather than in 1299 as suggested by the legend of Sang Nila Utama given in the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;.

Portuguese sources indicate that Parameswara ruled Singapura for five years, he was then attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. Singapura came under the influence of the Malacca in the 15th century and, after the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese, the control of the Malay Sultanate of Johor in the 16th century. A settlement there was finally burnt to the ground by the Portuguese in 1613 and the island sank into obscurity for two hundred years until the early 19th century with the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles.
===Doubts over identification with Longyamen===
The Mao Kun map shows on the position of the Singapore Straits, a navigational route and instructions for sailing from Longyamen to Pedra Branca. In addition, it marks the name &quot;Longyamen&quot; on what appears to be Lingga Island, off the Sumatran west coast. Supported by the testimony of Fei Xin, who sailed on four occasions with Zheng He, that Longyamen was situated to the north-west of Sanfoqi, a polity believed to be Palembang, W.P. Groeneveldt believed Longyamen was the Strait of Lingga. 

J.V.G. Mills, who questioned the association of Keppel Harbour with Longyamen, carefully compared the sailing instructions on the Mao Kun Map with corresponding directions given in relevant itineraries found in three Ming era Chinese rutters, namely Shun Feng Xiang Song (順風相送, “Fair Winds for Escort”, dated circa 1430), Bing Qian (兵鈐, Military Manual, dated 1674) and Dong Xi Yang Kao (東西洋考, “A Study of the Eastern and Western Oceans”, dated 1617). Mill’s conclusion was that the Longyamen was the main Singapore Strait, and not Keppel Harbour. This is precisely as drawn on the Mao Kun Map.

Significantly the instructions from Shun Feng Xiang Song and Dong Xi Yang Kao referred to a Temasek Gate (淡馬錫門) by which vessels passed no matter if they were sailing in and out of Longyamen from Karimun or Pedra Branca. Wang Dayuan&#x27;s actual words were that &quot;[Longyamen] is intersected with two mountains belonging to the Temasek natives, akin to a dragon teeth-like formation, with a water channel running through the middle”. Teochews settlers who first came to Singapore in 1819 referred to the Telok Blangah area by Keppel Harbour as Sek-lak-mung (石叻門), meaning the “Gate of Selat”, or the &quot;Gate of the Strait&quot;. This shows Temasek Gate was Keppel Harbour and supports that Longyamen was the main Singapore Straits. Moreover, Wang Dayuan&#x27;s writing was clear that the &quot;dragon teeth&quot; were mountains/hills, and not rocks.

==Singapore&#x27;s national honours==
The Republic&#x27;s two most important national honours are titled Bintang Temasek (&quot;The Star of Temasek&quot; for acts of exceptional courage and skill or exhibiting conspicuous devotion to duty in circumstances of extreme danger) and the Darjah Utama Temasek (&quot;Order of Temasek&quot;, for outstanding and exceptional contributions to the country).

<text>Keith Hamilton Cobb (born January 28, 1962) is an American actor.

==Career==
He is best known for his roles as the ruthless Nietzschean mercenary Tyr Anasazi in the science-fiction series &quot;Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s Andromeda&quot; from 2000 to 2005 and as Noah Keefer on &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1994 to 1996.

Cobb was born in North Tarrytown, New York; he graduated from New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in 1987. A classically trained actor, he appeared in a number of Shakespearean productions in the New York area before breaking into television in the mid 1990s. One of his first movies was the 1995 film &quot;Eyes Beyond Seeing&quot; in which he plays a mental patient who claims to be Jesus Christ.

In 1996, Cobb was named on &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the &quot;50 most beautiful people&quot;.

In 1999, Cobb was in two episodes of the &quot;Beastmaster&quot; television series, portraying a character very similar to his character from &quot;Andromeda&quot;.

He left the &quot;Andromeda&quot; TV series at the start of the fourth season, citing dissatisfaction over the development of his character and went back to stage productions.

Cobb&#x27;s 2015 play &quot;American Moor&quot; explores the experiences of Black actors performing texts as written and directed by white writers and directors. The play garnered great academic acclaim. The play debuted Off-Broadway at the Cherry Lane Theatre in August 2019.

He continues to act in theater productions, including roles as Oberon and Duke Theseus in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in New York&#x27;s Geva Theater Center, and the bigoted Juror #10 in &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; at Briggs Opera House in White River Junction, Vermont.

==Filmography==

==Awards and nominations==
In 1995 Cobb won the Soap Opera Digest Award - Outstanding Male Newcomer for his role of Noah Keefer on &quot;All My Children&quot; and in 1996 won the Soap Opera Digest Award - Hottest Soap Couple for his work on &quot;All My Children&quot; (shared with Sydney Penny).

<text>Aegypiinae is one of two subfamilies of Accipitridae that are referred to as Old World vultures, the other being the Gypaetinae. They are not closely related to the Gypaetinae, and are instead a sister group to the serpent-eagles (Circaetinae).

Presently found throughout much of Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe, fossil evidence indicates that as recently as the Late Pleistocene, they ranged into Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The subfamily Aegypiinae was introduced (as the family Aegypiidae) in 1924 by the British zoologist William Lutley Sclater with &quot;Aegypius&quot; Savigny, 1809, as the type genus.

The cladogram of the Aegypiinae shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae by Therese Catanach and collaborators that was published in 2024.

<text>Polar drift is a geological phenomenon caused by variations in the flow of molten iron in Earth&#x27;s outer core, resulting in changes in the orientation of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and hence the position of the magnetic north- and south poles.

The North magnetic pole is approximately from the geographic North Pole. The pole drifts considerably each day, which results in a change of 5-60 km per year. The speed of the change was around 10 km/year for the majority of the 20th century, then increased in the 1990s to over 50 km/year, but slowed down slightly after 2020.
The South magnetic pole is constantly shifting due to changes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.
 it was calculated to lie at , placing it off the coast of Antarctica, between Adélie Land and Wilkes Land. 

In 2015, it lay at (est). That point lies outside the Antarctic Circle and it is moving northwest by about per year. Its current distance from the actual Geographic South Pole is approximately . The nearest permanent science station is Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station. Wilkes Land contains a large gravitational mass concentration.

<doc id="439822" wikidata="Q7239850" url="?curid=439822" title="Prefetch input queue">
<text>Fetching the instruction opcodes from program memory well in advance is known as prefetching and it is served by using a prefetch input queue (PIQ). The pre-fetched instructions are stored in a queue. The fetching of opcodes well in advance, prior to their need for execution, increases the overall efficiency of the processor boosting its speed. The processor no longer has to wait for the memory access operations for the subsequent instruction opcode to complete. This architecture was prominently used in the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

==Introduction==

Pipelining was brought to the forefront of computing architecture design during the 1960s due to the need for faster and more efficient computing. Pipelining is the broader concept and most modern processors load their instructions some clock cycles before they execute them. This is achieved by pre-loading machine code from memory into a &quot;prefetch input queue&quot;.

This behavior only applies to von Neumann computers (that is, not Harvard architecture computers) that can run self-modifying code and have some sort of instruction pipelining. Nearly all modern high-performance computers fulfill these three requirements.

Usually, the prefetching behavior of the PIQ is invisible to the programming model of the CPU. However, there are some circumstances where the behavior of PIQ is visible, and needs to be taken into account by the programmer.

When an x86 processor changes mode from real mode to protected mode and vice versa, the PIQ has to be flushed, or else the CPU will continue to translate the machine code as if it were written in its last mode. If the PIQ is not flushed, the processor might translate its codes wrong and generate an invalid instruction exception.

When executing self-modifying code, a change in the processor code immediately in front of the current location of execution might not change how the processor interprets the code, as it is already loaded into its PIQ. It simply executes its old copy already loaded in the PIQ instead of the new and altered version of the code in its RAM and/or cache.

This behavior of the PIQ can be used to determine if code is being executed inside an emulator or directly on the hardware of a real CPU. Most emulators will &quot;probably&quot; never simulate this behavior. If the PIQ-size is zero (changes in the code &quot;always&quot; affect the state of the processor immediately), it can be deduced that either the code is being executed in an emulator or the processor invalidates the PIQ upon writes to addresses loaded in the PIQ.

==Performance evaluation based on queuing theory==
It was A.K Erlang (1878-1929) who first conceived of a queue as a solution to congestion in telephone traffic. Different queueing models are proposed in order to approximately simulate the real time queuing systems so that those can be analysed mathematically for different performance specifications.

Queuing models can be represented using Kendall&#x27;s notation:

:A1/A2/A3/A4

where:

* A1 is the distribution of time between two arrivals
* A2 is the service time distribution
* A3 is the total number of servers
* A4 is the capacity of system

# M/M/1 Model (Single Queue Single Server/ Markovian): In this model, elements of queue are served on a first-come, first-served basis. Given the mean arrival and service rates, then actual rates vary around these average values randomly and hence have to be determined using a cumulative probability distribution function.
# M/M/r Model: This model is a generalization of the basic M/M/1 model where multiple servers operate in parallel. This kind of model can also model scenarios with impatient users who leave the queue immediately if they are not receiving service. This can also be modeled using a Bernoulli process having only two states, success and failure. The best example of this model is our regular land-line telephone systems.
# M/G/1 Model (Takacs&#x27; finite input Model) : This model is used to analyze advanced cases. Here the service time distribution is no longer a Markov process. This model considers the case of more than one failed machine being repaired by single repairman. Service time for any user is going to increase in this case.

Generally in applications like prefetch input queue, M/M/1 Model is popularly used because of limited use of queue features. In this model in accordance with microprocessors, the user takes the role of the execution unit and server is the bus interface unit.

==Instruction queue==
The processor executes a program by fetching the instructions from memory and executing them. Usually the processor execution speed is much faster than the memory access speed. Instruction queue is used to prefetch the next instructions in a separate buffer while the processor is executing the current instruction.

With a four stage pipeline, the rate at which instructions are executed can be up to four times that of sequential execution.

The processor usually has two separate units for fetching the instructions and for executing the instructions.

The implementation of a pipeline architecture is possible only if the bus interface unit and the execution unit are independent. While the execution unit is decoding or executing an instruction which does not require the use of the data and address buses, the bus interface unit fetches instruction opcodes from the memory.

This process is much faster than sending out an address, reading the opcode and then decoding and executing it. Fetching the next instruction while the current instruction is being decoded or executed is called pipelining.

The 8086 processor has a six-byte prefetch instruction pipeline, while the 8088 has a four-byte prefetch. As the Execution Unit is executing the current instruction, the bus interface unit reads up to six (or four) bytes of opcodes in advance from the memory. The queue lengths were chosen based on simulation studies.

An exception is encountered when the execution unit encounters a branch instruction i.e. either a jump or a call instruction. In this case, the entire queue must be dumped and the contents pointed to by the instruction pointer must be fetched from memory.

==Drawbacks==

Processors implementing the instruction queue prefetch algorithm are rather technically advanced. The CPU design level complexity of the such processors is much higher than for regular processors. This is primarily because of the need to implement two separate units, the BIU and EU, operating separately.

As the complexity of these chips increases, the cost also increases. These processors are relatively costlier than their counterparts without the prefetch input queue.

However, these disadvantages are greatly offset by the improvement in processor execution time. After the introduction of prefetch instruction queue in the 8086 processor, all successive processors have incorporated this feature.

==x86 example code==

code_starts_here:
 mov bx, ahead
 mov word ptr cs:[bx], 9090h
ahead:
 jmp near to_the_end
 ; Some other code
to_the_end:
This self-modifying program will overwrite the &quot;jmp to_the_end&quot; with two NOPs (which is encoded as &quot;0x9090&quot;). The jump &quot;jmp near to_the_end&quot; is assembled into two bytes of machine code, so the two NOPs will just overwrite this jump and nothing else. (That is, the jump is replaced with a do-nothing-code.)

Because the machine code of the jump is already read into the PIQ, and probably also already executed by the processor (superscalar processors execute several instructions at once, but they &quot;pretend&quot; that they don&#x27;t because of the need for backward compatibility), the change of the code will not have any change of the execution flow.

===Example program to detect size===
This is an example NASM-syntax self-modifying x86-assembly language algorithm that determines the size of the PIQ:
code_starts_here:
 xor bx, bx ; zero register bx
 xor ax, ax ; zero register ax

 mov dx, cs
 mov [code_segment], dx ; &quot;calculate&quot; codeseg in the far jump below (edx here too)

around:
 cmp ax, 1 ; check if ax has been altered
 je found_size
 ; 0x90 = opcode &quot;nop&quot; (NO oPeration)
 mov byte [nop_field+bx], 0x90
 inc bx

 db 0xEA ; 0xEA = opcode &quot;far jump&quot;

What this code does is basically that it changes the execution flow, and determines by brute force how large the PIQ is. &quot;How far away do I have to change the code in front of me for it to affect me?&quot;
If it is too near (it is already in the PIQ) the update will not have any effect. If it is far enough, the change of the code will affect the program and the program has then found the size of the processor&#x27;s PIQ.
If this code is being executed under multitasking OS, the context switch may lead to the wrong value.

<text>Gyps is a genus of Old World vultures that was proposed by Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809. Its members are sometimes known as griffon vultures. &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures have a slim head, a long slender neck with downy feathers, and a ruff around the neck formed by long buoyant feathers. The crown of their big beaks is a little compressed, and their big dark nostrils are set transverse to the beak. They have six or seven wing feathers, of which the first is the shortest and the fourth the longest.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Gyps&quot; was introduced in 1809 by the French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny to accommodate the Eurasian griffon vulture. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;gups&quot; meaning &quot;vulture&quot;. The genus contains eight extant species.

Two fossil species have been described:
* † Maltese vulture &quot;G. melitensis&quot; Lydekker, 1890 – Fossil remains were found in Middle to Late Pleistocene sites all over the central and eastern Mediterranean.
* † &quot;G. bochenskii&quot; Boev, 2010 – Fossil remains were found near Varshets in northwestern Bulgaria that were dated to the Late Pliocene.

<text>Karpathos (, ), also Carpathos, is the second largest of the Greek Dodecanese islands, in the southeastern Aegean Sea. Together with the neighboring smaller Saria Island it forms the municipality of Karpathos, which is part of the regional unit Karpathos-Kasos. Because of its remote location, Karpathos has preserved many peculiarities of dress, customs and dialect, the last resembling those of Crete and Cyprus. The island has also been called Carpathus in Latin and Scarpanto in Italian.

== Etymology ==
Homer calls the island Krapathos, with metathesis of two letters in the first syllable. Other names of the island include Tetrapolis and Anemoessa.

==Municipality==
The present municipality of Karpathos was formed at the 2011 local government reform, by the merger of the following two former municipalities, that became municipal units:
* Karpathos
* Olympos

The municipality has an area of 324.800 km2, and the municipal unit spans 219.924 km2.

== Mythology ==
Karpathos is the mythological homeland of the Titan Iapetus, and the birthplace of Proteus.

==History==

The island of Karpathos was in both ancient and medieval times closely connected with Rhodes. Its current name is mentioned, with a slight shift of one letter, in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; as Krapathos (). Apollonius of Rhodes, in his epic &quot;Argonautica&quot;, made it a port of call for the Argonauts travelling between Libya and Crete (). The island is also mentioned by Diodorus who claims it was a colony of the Dorians, Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo.The Karpathians sided with Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 431 BCE and lost their independence to Rhodes in 400 BCE. In 42 BCE, the island fell to Rome. After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 CE, the island became part of the Byzantine Empire.

Of its Christian bishops, the names that are known of are; Olympius, who was a supporter of Nestorius, Zoticus (in 518), Mennas (in 553), Ioannes, Leo (in 787), and Philippus (in 879). In the 14th century, the island was a see of the Latin Church, four of whose bishops bore the name Nicolaus. No longer a residential bishopric, Karpathos (in Latin Carpathus) is today listed by the Catholic Church as an archiepiscopal titular see.

In 1304, Karpathos was given as fief to the Genoese corsairs Andrea and Lodovico Moresco, but in 1306 it fell to Andrea Cornaro, a member of the Venetian Cornaro family. The Cornaro controlled Karpathos until 1538, when it passed into the possession of the Ottoman Turks.

During the Greek War of Independence from 1821 to 1822, the island rebelled, but afterwards it fell again under Ottoman rule. In 1835, Sultan Mahmud II conceded to the island the privilege of the &quot;maktu&quot; tax system; that is, the tax was calculated as an annual lump sum, and not on a household basis. The Ottoman rule ended on 12 May 1912, when the Italians occupied the island and the rest of the Dodecanese, during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12. On that day, sailors from the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; battleship &quot;Vittorio Emanuele&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Alpino&quot; landed in Karpathos. With the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), Karpathos joined the other islands of the Dodecanese in the Italian possession of the Italian Aegean Islands. The Italians occupied the island until September 1943, when Italy surrendered. Afterwards, Karpathos was occupied by German forces, who eventually left the island on 4 October 1944. The island was ceded by Italy to Greece with the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947. The island formally joined the Kingdom of Greece on 7 March 1948, together with the other Dodecanese islands.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, due to the economic problems after World War II, a number of Karpathians emigrated to the U.S. eastern seaboard cities; Karpathos today has a significant Greek-American constituency who have returned to their island and invested heavily. Inhabitants of the mountains to the north are more traditional.

==Exploration==
Among 19th-century explorers of the island were the British explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent in the spring of 1885. Most of their energies were spent in excavating the site of Vroukounta in the far north of the island. Some of their finds are now in the British Museum, London.

==Geography==

The island is located about southwest of Rhodes, in the part of the Mediterranean which is called the &quot;Carpathian Sea&quot; (). The Sea of Crete, a sub-basin of the Mediterranean Sea, has its eastern limit defined by the island of Karpathos. Karpathos&#x27; highest point is Kali Limni, at . Karpathos comprises 11 villages. Pigadia (official name &quot;Karpathos&quot;), the capital and main port of the island, is located in the southeast of the island. The capital is surrounded by the villages of Menetes, Arkasa, Finiki, Pyles, Othos, Volada and Aperi. The villages of Mesochori and Spoa are located in central Karpathos while Olympos and the second port of Karpathos Diafani are in the north.

The island Saria was once united with Karpathos, but an earthquake divided them. Saria preserves many important antiquities.
===Climate===
Karpathos has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;). The island has one of the mildest winters in Europe, and according to the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, the lowest temperature that has been recorded, was on 9 February 1976 and 14 February 2004. 

==Transportation==
Karpathos Island National Airport, with its relatively large runway, is located on the south side (Afiartis area). Karpathos is connected to neighboring islands and to the mainland via ferries and airplanes. The ferries provide transport to and from Piraeus (via Crete and Rhodes). Scheduled domestic flights connect the island with Rhodes, Kasos, Crete and Athens daily. Additionally, charter flights from various European cities are frequently scheduled during the high season (April–October).Within the island, cars are the preferred mode of transportation. The port, the airport, the main villages and other popular locations are connected by an adequate system of municipal roads, most of which are paved. During the summer months, small private boats depart from Pigadia to various locations daily, including Olympos (via Diafani) and some inaccessible beaches. Fixed-rate taxis (&quot;agoraia&quot;) and municipal buses are also available all year long.

==Population==
The municipality&#x27;s 2021 census population was 6,567 inhabitants. This number more than doubles in the summer months as many Karpathian expatriates come to the island for their vacation with their families. Also, taking into consideration the number of tourists that visit, there can be up to 20,000 people on the island during the summer months. The population density is greatest on the 15th of August due to the Panagias festival (Dormition of Mary), which is considered the most important festival on the island. Individuals travel from around the world to attend the festival and view the many traditions that still remain on the island.

=== Census ===
== Beaches ==

The beaches of Karpathos island can be divided into four large groups: the beaches on the east coast are smaller and gravelly but without wind; the beaches of the southern part of the island, near the airport, are made of fine white sand; the sandy beaches on the west coast are the most exposed to the Meltemi and they are available only in low wind conditions; the beaches of the north of the island are accessible only by sea and partly by jeep.
* East coast: Amoopi, Karpathos Beach (Vrontis), Achata, Kato Latos (reachable only on foot), Kyra Panagia, Apella, Agios Nikolaos (Spoa).
* South coast: Mihaliou o Kipos (known by inhabitants of the village of Othos as &quot;Shell beach&quot;), Damatria, Diakoftis, Devils Bay, Agrilaopotamos (nude beach), Pounta beach.
* West coast: Lefkos beach, Mesohori, Finiki, Arkasa Leucadius.
* North coast: Diafani, Alimounta (Saria island), Palatia (Saria island), Kalamia, Vananda, Apokapos (or Papa-Mina), Opsi, Kantri, Forokli, Kapi, Nati, Philios (or Agios Minas), Agnontia.

<text>David Behrman (born August 16, 1937) is an American composer and a pioneer of computer music. In the early 1960s he was the producer of Columbia Records&#x27; &quot;Music of Our Time&quot; series, which included the first recording of Terry Riley&#x27;s &quot;In C&quot;. In 1966 Behrman co-founded Sonic Arts Union with fellow composers Robert Ashley, Alvin Lucier and Gordon Mumma. He wrote the music for Merce Cunningham&#x27;s dances &quot;Walkaround Time&quot; (1968), &quot;Rebus&quot; (1975), &quot;Pictures&quot; (1984) and &quot;Eyespace 40&quot; (2007). In 1978, he released his debut album &quot;On the Other Ocean&quot;, a pioneering work combining computer music with live performance.
==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Behrman&#x27;s father, S. N. Behrman, was a successful playwright and Hollywood screenplay writer. His mother Elza Heifetz Behrman was the sister of violinist Jascha Heifetz.

Behrman attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where his classmates included Carl Andre, Hollis Frampton and Frank Stella. There he also developed a lifelong friendship with composer and pianist Frederic Rzewski. While attending summer camp at Indian Hill in 1953 he was taught modern music by Wallingford Riegger. He received a BA from Harvard in 1959. At Harvard, he formed a lifelong friendship with Christian Wolff and where he continued his friendship with Frederic Rzewski. He attended the summer school at Darmstadt in 1959, where he met La Monte Young and Nam June Paik. He received a Master of Arts from Columbia University in 1963.

===Teaching===
He has been a member of the Avery Graduate Arts Program faculty at Bard College since 1998. He was co-director of the Center for Contemporary Music at Mills College in 1975–1980, and has taught also at the California Institute of the Arts, Ohio State University, Rutgers University, and Technische Universität Berlin.

==Music==
Behrman is known as a minimalist composer. His music has often involved interactions between live performers and computers, usually with the computer generating sounds triggered by some aspect of the live performance, usually certain pitches, but sometimes other aspects of the live sound, such as volume in &quot;QRSL&quot; (as recorded by Maggi Payne on &quot;The Extended Flute&quot; (CRI807). Many of his significant works, such as &quot;On the Other Ocean&quot;, &quot;Interspecies Small Talk&quot;, are based on a pitch sensing computer music system.

==Personal life==
Behrman was briefly married to Japanese video artist, sculptor and avant-garde performance artist Shigeko Kubota. The marriage ended in 1969. He has been married since 1979 to media-artist Terri Hanlon.

Behrman lives in New York City.

<doc id="439831" wikidata="Q847841" url="?curid=439831" title="Will Penny">
<text>Will Penny is a 1968 American Western film written and directed by Tom Gries and starring Charlton Heston, Joan Hackett and Donald Pleasence. The picture was based upon an episode of the 1960 Sam Peckinpah television series &quot;The Westerner&quot; starring Brian Keith called &quot;Line Camp,&quot; also written and directed by Tom Gries. Heston mentioned that this was his favorite film in which he appeared. The supporting cast features Lee Majors, Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, and Slim Pickens.

==Plot==
A trail drive is coming to an end, with the resulting payoff of the now out-of-work trail hands. A trio of punchers, Blue, Dutchy, and an aging Will Penny decide to drift south and avoid the oncoming winter. Will trades his position riding on the train with the cattle to a young cowboy who wants to visit his dying father and tells Will there may be work at the Flat Iron ranch.

One morning Blue is about to fire at a bull elk near a river bottom. Mysteriously, the elk is shot by an unseen party. As Blue and Dutchy move in to claim the elk anyway, they encounter the shooter, a &quot;rawhider&quot; and his family. The two groups contest the right to the meat. Gunfire erupts, and Will shows up, shoots and kills one of the rawhider&#x27;s sons. The rawhider swears a biblical revenge. Dutchy accidentally wounds himself in the exchange, so the trio head out to find a doctor and first come to a nearby trail store, where they encounter Catherine Allen and her son Horace. After getting a few drinks of whiskey they move on to the nearest town and leave Dutchy at the doctor. Blue decides to look for a job in the town, while Will proceeds alone. He comes across a horse without a rider and locates a dead cowboy, thrown from his saddle. Will turns the body over to the Flat Iron ranch that the cowboy rode for and is offered a job.

Will hires on to ride the far-off boundaries of Flat Iron ranch over the winter. As he arrives at the upper range, he finds Catherine and Horace staying in the line-rider&#x27;s cabin after being abandoned by their guide. He rides away to inspect the fence line, warning them that they must be gone when he returns in one week.

The next morning as Will is sleeping outside near the fence, he is ambushed and savagely beaten up and knifed by the rawhider group. They rob and leave Will for dead, but he drags himself to the cabin, where he is slowly nursed back to health by Catherine.

As the winter passes, Will and Catherine fall in love, and Will develops fatherly affection for Horace.

As Will and Catherine prepare for Christmas, the Quint family bursts into the cabin, force Will into doing the chores, and coerce Catherine to decide on one of the ne&#x27;er do well, belligerent, hair-trigger sons. After some days, Catherine distracts the two Quint sons so Will can make an escape. At that same time his two former saddle pals Blue and Dutchy arrive looking for him. Will and Blue return to attack the cabin to free Catherine and Horace, using a bag of sulfur in the chimney to smoke out the rawhiders and then shoot them all.

With the rawhiders dead the Flat Iron trail boss arrives, Will realizes that he is too old and set in his ways to settle down into a domestic life with Catherine, against her protestations. Deeply regretful about what he is leaving behind, he rides away with Dutchy and Blue to collect on a bet with the store owner on Dutchy’s survival and continue his life as a trail hand. He donated his wages from the ranch to Catherine.

==Reviews==
&quot;The admirable thing about the movie is its devotion to real life. These are the kind of people, we feel, who must really have inhabited the West: common, direct, painfully shy in social situations and very honest.&quot; — Roger Ebert, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;

&quot;And I got to really like the guy. A lot of people told me that I wouldn&#x27;t like him, but I liked him. And he tried very hard. I mean, &quot;Will Penny&quot; is far and away the best thing he&#x27;s ever done.&quot; — Bruce Dern on Charlton Heston

&quot;Intelligent and thoughtful, Will Penny is a good Western and even a better character study. The West is more than deglamorized here; we get a good approximation of what a real cowboy&#x27;s life might have been like around the turn of the century.&quot; — DVD Savant, DVDTalk

&quot;The villains in Will Penny are so unbelievable and so unrealistic that they almost seem like they came out of a Western spoof, rather than the serious, realistic Western which Will Penny aspires to be (and achieves in most other aspects of the story).&quot; — Erik Rupp, Vista Records

&quot;This is one of the classic movies of all time. It will last for all eternity as a classic in writing and in acting.&quot; — Ange Kenos, &quot;OPA Magazine&quot;

&quot;Charlton Heston told me this was the film he is most proud of and was his favorite screen role.&quot; — Rick Schmidlin, producer of the re-edited version of &quot;Touch of Evil.&quot;

<doc id="439833" wikidata="Q527830" url="?curid=439833" title="Pink-backed pelican">
<text>The pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) is a bird of the pelican family. It is a resident breeder in the swamps and shallow lakes of Africa and southern Arabia; it has also apparently been extirpated from Madagascar.

==Taxonomy==
The pink-backed pelican was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other pelicans in the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus rufescens&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;red-backed pelican&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds &quot;. Latham had been sent a specimen from West Africa. The specific epithet &quot;rufescens&quot; is Latin for &quot;reddish&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

It is a relatively small pelican, although by no means is it a small bird. Its length is from , wingspan is and body mass is from . The bill is in length. The plumage is grey and white, with a pinkish hue on the back occasionally apparent (never in the deep pink of a flamingo). The top of the bill is yellow and the pouch is usually greyish. Breeding adults have long feather plumes on the head.

It shares its habitat with the great white pelican, which is generally larger and has white instead of greyish plumage.

==Habitat and breeding==
The pink-backed pelican is found in a range of aquatic habitats, but prefers quiet backwaters with shallow water, avoiding steep, vegetated lake banks. It prefers for freshwater lakes, swamps, large slow-flowing rivers, and seasonal pools but also frequents reservoirs, seasonally flooded land and flood-plains near river mouths. It may occur on alkaline and saline lakes and lagoons, and can sometimes be found along the coast in bays and estuaries (although seldom on open seashore). The species tends to roost and breed in trees (e.g. mangroves), but will also roost on sandy islands, cliffs, coral reefs and sand-dunes.

Nesting trees have many nests built close together. These nests are re-used every year until the trees collapse, although the birds will normally remain in the area. The species nests colonially in trees, reeds or low bushes along waterfronts as well as (less often) on the ground on sandy islands and in mangroves.

Its nest is a large heap of sticks and may be 10–50 m above the ground. The female lays two to three large white eggs and later the chicks feed by plunging their heads deep into the adult&#x27;s pouch and taking the partially digested regurgitated fish.

==Diet==
Food is usually fish (of any size up to 450 g, usually in the 80-290 g range) and amphibians, and is usually obtained by fishing in groups. Among the fish preyed upon are cichlids like &quot;Haplochromis&quot; and &quot;Tilapia&quot;.

<text>Roy J. Bittan (born July 2, 1949) is an American musician best known as a long-time member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band. Nicknamed &quot;The Professor&quot;, Bittan joined the E Street Band in 1974. He plays the piano, organ, accordion and synthesizers. Bittan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 as a member of the E Street Band.

Aside from his membership in the E Street Band, Bittan has worked as a session musician for singer-songwriters and rock and pop artists.

==Life and career==
Bittan was born in Queens, New York and is Jewish. He is a longtime member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band and has performed on the majority of Springsteen&#x27;s albums, beginning with &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975). In Springsteen&#x27;s band introductions, Bittan&#x27;s &quot;Professor&quot; moniker was given because (supposedly) he was the only member of the group with a college degree. Bittan provided backing vocals for the song &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, along with Steven Van Zandt and Mike Appel. His voice is also featured slightly on the vocal weaving in &quot;Out in the Street&quot;. However, from the Born in the U.S.A. Tour on, his voice was no longer used. When Springsteen decided to break his connection with the E Street Band in 1989, Bittan was the only member he retained.

With the E Street Band, Bittan uses a Yamaha grand piano, preferring the bright sound to cut through the group&#x27;s sound compared with other acoustic models. He has also been known to use Yamaha, Korg and Kurzweil keyboards as part of his live rig. Bittan is an avid accordion player, which was a skill he seldom used with the E Street Band until he played &quot;American Land&quot; as the closing number on the 2007–2008 Magic Tour and later played the instrument on &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; after the death of bandmate Danny Federici.

Aside from his membership in the E Street Band, Bittan has worked as a session musician for singer-songwriters and rock and pop artists, including Bonnie Tyler, Jon Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Jackson Browne, Lucinda Williams, Tracy Chapman, Chicago, Catie Curtis, Dire Straits, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, Ian Hunter, Meat Loaf, Stevie Nicks, Bob Seger, Lou Reed, Celine Dion, Nelly Furtado, Patty Smyth, and Jim Steinman.

Bittan played piano on Meat Loaf&#x27;s 1977 hit album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;. Composer Jim Steinman wanted Bittan for the album due to his love for Springsteen&#x27;s early work, particularly on &quot;Born to Run&quot;. Following those sessions, Bittan regularly and nearly exclusively collaborated with Steinman, appearing on three more Meat Loaf albums (most notably &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell)&quot;, Steinman&#x27;s solo album &quot;Bad for Good&quot;, an Air Supply single, a Barbra Streisand single, an album by Pandora&#x27;s Box, &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, and others.

Bittan also played on the Dire Straits album &quot;Making Movies&quot; (1980). Mark Knopfler&#x27;s decision to have the keyboardist on the album&#x27;s lineup was reportedly influenced by his affection for &quot;Because the Night&quot;, a keyboard-driven hit song cowritten by Springsteen and Patti Smith.

Bittan played on the 1978 second solo album from Peter Gabriel, appearing on the songs &quot;On the Air&quot;, &quot;Mother of Violence&quot;, &quot;D.I.Y.&quot; and &quot;White Shadow&quot;. Bittan also played on two David Bowie albums, &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976) and &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; (1980).

Bittan influenced the sound Stevie Nicks created for her solo debut away from Fleetwood Mac, &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (1981). About the time that the album reached number one in the United States (and Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The River&quot; Tour concluded), Bittan joined as a sideman on a short tour with Nicks along with some of the other top musicians of the day: Benmont Tench on organ, bass guitarist Bob Glaub, Waddy Wachtel on guitar, Russ Kunkel on drums, and Bobbeye Hall on percussion. Bittan also played on Nicks&#x27; second solo album &quot;The Wild Heart&quot; and has continued to play with her sporadically.

Bittan produced and played accordion on Lucinda Williams&#x27;s album &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;. He also played accordion on Nelly Furtado&#x27;s album &quot;The Spirit Indestructible&quot; on a track entitled &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot;.

Bittan released his first solo album, &quot;Out of the Box&quot;, in 2014.

<doc id="439840" wikidata="Q1580058" url="?curid=439840" title="Gostak">
<text>&quot;Gostak&quot;, a meaningless noun, occurs in the phrase &quot;the gostak distims the doshes&quot;, which exemplifies how it is possible to derive meaning from the syntax of a sentence even if the referents of the terms are entirely unknown. It is an example of a nonce word.

The phrase, coined in 1903 by Andrew Ingraham became popularised through its quotation in 1923 by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards in their book &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot;, and has since been referenced in a number of cultural contexts.

==History==
Coined in 1903 by Andrew Ingraham, the sentence became more widely known through its quotation in 1923 by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards in their book &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot; (p. 46).

Ogden and Richards refer to Ingraham as an &quot;able but little known writer&quot;, and quote his following dialogue:
==Deriving meaning==
This can be seen in the following dialogue:

:Q: What is the gostak?
:A: The gostak is what distims the doshes.
:Q: What&#x27;s distimming?
:A: Distimming is what the gostak does to the doshes.
:Q: Okay, but what are doshes?
:A: The doshes are what the gostak distims.

In this case, it is possible to describe the grammatical and syntactical relationships between the terms in the sentence — that &quot;gostak&quot; is a noun subject, &quot;distimming&quot; is a transitive verb, and &quot;doshes&quot; is a plural direct object — even though there is no fact of the matter about what a &quot;gostak&quot; or &quot;distimming&quot; or &quot;doshes&quot; actually are.

==Cultural references==
The phrase appears in a number of subsequent cultural contexts including:

===Science fiction===

Miles Breuer wrote a story, published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; for March 1930 and now considered a classic, titled &quot;The Gostak and the Doshes&quot; whose protagonist travels to an alternate Earth in which the phrase is a political slogan, one that induces sufficient umbrage throughout the populace to declare justified, righteous war. The protagonist attempts to discern the meaning, but every definition he receives is some rewording of the phrase. Other writers have picked up on the reference, notably David Gerrold.

===Interactive fiction===

The phrase is the namesake of an interactive fiction game called &quot;The Gostak&quot;, written by Carl Muckenhoupt. Most of the text of the game is in an entirely unknown language (fundamentally English in syntax and grammar, but with much of the vocabulary and even idiomatic constructions changed) which the player must decipher, not only to understand the game&#x27;s text but also to type commands in the same language. For example, the game opens with the following text:

&quot;The Gostak&quot; won the 2001 XYZZY Awards for Best Use of Medium and Best Individual Puzzle.

<doc id="439841" wikidata="Q25077" url="?curid=439841" title="13 May incident">
<text>The 13 May incident was an episode of Sino-Malay sectarian violence that took place in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, on 13 May 1969. The riot occurred in the aftermath of the 1969 Malaysian general election, when opposition parties such as the Democratic Action Party and Gerakan made gains at the expense of the ruling coalition, the Alliance Party.

Official reports by the government placed the number of deaths due to the riots at 196, although international diplomatic sources and observers at the time suggested a toll of close to 600, while others named much higher figures, with most of the victims being ethnic Chinese. The race riots led to a declaration of a state of national emergency by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, resulting in the suspension of parliament. A National Operations Council was established as a caretaker government to temporarily govern the country between 1969 and 1971.

This event was significant in Malaysian politics, as it forced the first prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to step down from office and hand over the reins to Abdul Razak Hussein. Abdul Razak&#x27;s government shifted their domestic policies to favour Malays with the implementation of the New Economic Policy, and the Malay party UMNO restructured the political system to advance Malay dominance in accordance with the ideology of &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; ( &quot;Malay supremacy&quot;).

==Precursors==
===Ethnic divide===
On 31 August 1957, Malaya gained its independence from colonial rule. The country, however, suffered from a sharp division of wealth between the Chinese, who dominated most urban areas and were perceived to be in control of a large portion of the nation&#x27;s economy, and the Malays, who were generally poorer and lived in more rural areas. The special privileged position of Malay political power, however, is guaranteed under Article 153 of the constitution, written during Malayan independence.

There were heated debates between Malay groups wanting radical measures to institutionalise Malay supremacy (&quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot;), while Chinese groups called for their &quot;racial&quot; interest to be protected, and non-Malay opposition party members arguing for a &#x27;Malaysian Malaysia&quot; rather than Malay privilege. In 1963, amid a background of racial tension, Malaysia was formed as a federation that incorporated Malaya (Peninsular Malaysia), Singapore, North Borneo, and Sarawak.

There had been several incidents of racial conflict between Malays and Chinese before the 1969 riots. For example, in Penang, hostility between the races turned into violence during the centenary celebration of George Town in 1957, which resulted in several days of fighting and several deaths, and there were further disturbances in 1959 and 1964 as well as a riot in 1967, which originated as a protest against currency devaluation but turned into racial killings. In Singapore, antagonism between the races led to the 1964 race riots, which contributed to the separation of Singapore from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.

===1969 national election===
In the 1969 general election, the governing coalition of the Alliance Party faced a strong challenge from opposition parties, in particular the two newly formed and mainly Chinese parties, the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Parti Gerakan. The election was preceded by outbreaks of racial incidents that contributed to a tense atmosphere. A Malay political worker was killed by a Chinese gang in Penang, while a Chinese Labour Party activist was shot and killed in a clash with police in Kuala Lumpur. Radical opponents called for a boycott of the election and threatened violence, but the funeral procession of the shot activist, which drew large crowds of more than ten thousand and was held before election day, passed largely peacefully despite a number of disruptive incidents.

The general election was held on 10 May 1969, without any incidents. The result showed that the Alliance had won less than half of the popular vote, a large setback for the ruling coalition. On the national level, the Alliance had gained a majority of seats in parliament, albeit a significantly reduced one. The number of seats won by the Chinese component of the Alliance, the Malaysian Chinese Association, had been reduced by half. On the state level, the Alliance had only gained the majority in Selangor by co-operating with the sole independent candidate as the opposition had tied with the Alliance for control of the Selangor state legislature (although immediately after the election, it was unclear that the Alliance would still have control). The Alliance lost control of Kelantan (to the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party) and Perak, and the opposition Gerakan won control of the state government in Penang.

===Post-election celebrations===
On the nights of 11 and 12 May, the DAP and Gerakan celebrated their success in the election, with permission being sought by Tan Chee Khoon from the police. In particular, a large Gerakan procession welcomed the Gerakan leader, V. David. Opposition parades passed through Malay communities such as Kampung Baru and were alleged to be highly provocative, with non-Malays taunting Malays while bearing slogans such as &quot; (finish off all the Malays) and &quot; (Kuala Lumpur now belongs to the Chinese). Some opposition supporters were said to have driven past the residence of the Selangor chief minister and demanded that he abandon the house in favour of a Chinese person.

Celebrations by opposition parties were seen as an attack on Malay political power. Although the election results still favoured the Malays despite losses, the Malay newspaper &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot; suggested in an editorial that the results had jeopardised the future of Malay rule and that prompt action was required to shore it up. On 12 May, members of UMNO Youth indicated to Selangor&#x27;s Menteri Besar, Harun Idris, that they wanted to hold a victory parade. UMNO then announced a procession that would start from Idris&#x27;s residence. Tunku Abdul Rahman would later call the retaliatory parade &quot;inevitable, as otherwise the party members would be demoralised after the show of strength by the Opposition and the insults that had been thrown at them&quot;. Malays were brought from the rural areas into Kuala Lumpur, which was then a predominantly Chinese city. Thousands of Malays, some of them armed, arrived to join the parade.

==Rioting==
===Early events===
The UMNO procession was planned for 7:30 pm on 13 May. That morning, Malays began to gather at the residence of Harun Idris on Jalan Raja Muda, on the edge of Kampung Baru, although some were already there as early as Sunday evening. They came from various parts of the state, such as Morib (Harun&#x27;s constituency) and Banting, and some may have came from parts of Perak. According to the National Operations Council&#x27;s (NOC) official report, at around 6:30 pm, fistfights broke out in Setapak between a group of Malays from Gombak travelling to the rally and Chinese bystanders who taunted them, and this escalated into bottle- and stone-throwing. News of the fighting then reached the gathering crowd in Jalan Raja Muda, and shortly before 6:30 pm, many Malays broke off from the rallying point at Idris&#x27;s house and headed through adjoining Chinese sections. The Malays, armed with &quot;parangs&quot; and kris, burned cars and shops, killed, and looted in the Chinese areas. According to &quot;Time&quot;, at least eight Chinese people were killed in the initial attack. Once violence broke out, it spread rapidly and uncontrollably throughout the city within 45 minutes, to Jalan Campbell, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman (Batu Road), Kampung Datuk Keramat, Kampung Pandan, Cheras, and Kampung Kerinchi.

===Retaliations and armed response===
According to John Slimming, who wrote an account of the riot in 1969, the Chinese were taken by surprise and did not retaliate for more than an hour. The NOC&#x27;s official report, however, suggested that Chinese secret society elements had prepared for trouble and were in action when the violence started in Kampung Baru. On Batu Road, Chinese and Indian shopkeepers began to form themselves into an improvised defence force, while a Malay mob attempting to storm the Chow Kit Road area were met with armed secret society gang members and ran. The Chinese attacked Malays who were found in Chinese areas, and Malay patrons in cinemas were singled out and killed. The Chinese also attempted to burn down the UMNO headquarters on Batu Road and besieged the Salak South police station.

Early in the evening, the rioters were met by police, who used tear gas in an attempt to control them. A 24-hour curfew for Kuala Lumpur was announced on the radio at 7:35 pm and repeated on television at 8:00 pm. Later, between 8:30 and 9:00 pm, a shoot-to-kill order was given by Inspector General of Police Mohamed Salleh bin Ismael. This was followed by another shoot-to-kill order from the Chief of Armed Forces, General Tunku Osman Jiwa. The army was deployed, and they entered the areas affected by rioting at around 10:00 pm. Many people who were unaware of the curfew order were shot. Some were also shot while standing in their own doorways and gardens. Foreign correspondents reported seeing members of the Royal Malay Regiment firing into Chinese shophouses for no apparent reason.

By 5:00 am the next morning, the authorities at Kuala Lumpur Hospital reported that there were about 80 dead at the facility. Members of the hospital staff also reported that the initial casualties between 7:00 and 8:30 pm had all been Chinese suffering from parang slashes and stab wounds, but that between 8:30 and 10:30 pm, the victims were equally divided between Chinese and Malays. However, after about 10:30 pm, the casualties were almost all Chinese, with nearly all of them suffering from gunshot wounds.

===Later events===
The army gathered at crucial road junctions and patrolled the main streets, but even though a curfew had been announced, young men in areas such as Kampung Baru and Pudu ignored the order. Although most of the killings occurred on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the burning and looting of Chinese shops and houses by Malays continued, with most incidents of serious arson occurring on Thursday night and Friday; over 450 houses were burnt. People displaced by the riots, most of them Chinese, were sent to official refugee centres in different parts of town—the Malays to Stadium Negara and the Chinese to Stadium Merdeka, Chinwoo Stadium, and Shaw Road School. By Sunday, the number of Chinese refugees had increased to 3,500 in Merdeka Stadium, 1,500 in Chinwoo Stadium, and 800 in Shaw Road School, while the Malays in Stadium Negara had decreased from 650 on Thursday to 250 on Sunday. Over a thousand refugees were still left in Merdeka Stadium a month after the riot.

The curfew was relaxed briefly but quickly reimposed on Thursday morning. It was lifted again for three hours on Saturday morning. The curfew was gradually relaxed as the situation slowly returned to normal, but by the end of the month, it was still in force from 3:00 pm until 6:30 am.

The violence was concentrated in urban areas, and except for minor disturbances in Malacca, Perak, Penang, and neighbouring Singapore, where the populations of Chinese people were larger, the rest of the country remained calm.

On 28 June 1969, rioting broke out again in Sentul when Malays attacked Indians, and 15 were killed.

===Casualties===
According to disputed police figures, a total of 196 people were killed in the riots. The official figures gave 143 of the dead as Chinese, 25 Malay, 13 Indian, and 15 others (undetermined), although unofficial figures suggested a higher number of Chinese deaths. The police were authorised to bury any dead bodies found or dispose of them in any way they could without inquests or inquiries, and many of these were disposed of undocumented, which made estimation of the number of deaths difficult. Some were reported to have been thrown into the Klang River, and some were believed to have been disposed of in pools in tin mines. A mass burial of the victims was also captured on film at the Sungai Buloh leper colony near Kuala Lumpur. Western diplomatic sources at that time put the toll at close to 600, and Slimming estimated the number to be around 800 in the first week by including hundreds who were officially missing; other observers and correspondents suggested four-figure numbers.

According to official figures, 439 individuals were also recorded as injured. 753 cases of arson were logged, and 211 vehicles were destroyed or severely damaged.

==Immediate effects==
Immediately after the riot, the government assumed emergency powers and suspended parliament, which would reconvene again in 1971. It also suspended the press and established the National Operations Council (NOC).

===Declaration of emergency===
The government ordered an immediate curfew throughout the state of Selangor. Security forces, comprising some 2,000 Royal Malay Regiment soldiers and 3,600 police officers, were deployed and took control of the situation. On 14 and 16 May, a state of emergency and accompanying curfew were declared throughout the country.

On 15 May, the NOC, also known as the &quot;Majlis Gerakan Negara&quot; (MAGERAN), headed by Abdul Razak Hussein, was established following a proclamation of emergency by the sultan of Malaysia, Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu. Parts of the constitution were also suspended. With parliament suspended, the NOC became the supreme decision-making body for the next 18 months. State and District Operations Councils took over state and local governments. The NOC implemented security measures to restore law and order in the country, including the establishment of an unarmed vigilante corps, a territorial army, and police force battalions.

Newspaper publications were suspended on 15 May but resumed on 18 May, and censorship was then applied on 21 May. Foreign publications were banned, citizens found in possession of foreign news clippings were detained, and foreign reporters were criticised over allegations of racial bias by the army. The restoration of order in the country was gradually achieved. Curfews continued in most parts of the country but were gradually scaled back. Peace was restored in the affected areas within two months. In February 1971, parliamentary rule was re-established. The proclamation of emergency and Emergency Ordinance 1969 were never revoked, however.

==Official assessment==
The NOC released a report on 9 October 1969, which cited &quot;racial politics&quot; as the primary cause of the riots, but it was reluctant to assign blame to the Malays.

It also attributed the cause of the riots in part to both the Malayan Communist Party and secret societies:

It however said that the &quot;trouble turned out to be a communal clash between the Malays and the Chinese&quot; rather than an instance of communist insurgency. The report also denied rumours of lack of evenhandedness by the security forces in their handling of the crisis.

Tunku Abdul Rahman, in a book released two weeks before the report, blamed the opposition parties for the violence, as well as the influence of the communists, and thought that the incidents were sparked by Chinese communist youths. He absolved the majority of the Malays, Chinese, and Indians of any responsibility and considered the Malays who converged in Kuala Lumpur on 13 May to be merely responding to &quot;intolerable provocations&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The Rukun Negara, the de facto Malaysian pledge of allegiance, was a reaction to the riot. It was introduced on 31 August 1970 as a way to foster unity among Malaysians.

The Malay nationalist Mahathir Mohamad, who was then a lesser-known politician and lost his seat as an UMNO candidate in the 10 May election, blamed the riot on the government and especially on Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman for being &quot;simple-minded&quot; and not planning for a prosperous Malaysia where the Malays have a share of the economic stake. Abdul Rahman in turn blamed &quot;extremists&quot; such as Mahathir for the racial clashes, which led to Mahathir&#x27;s expulsion from UMNO. This propelled him to write his seminal work &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;, in which he posited a solution to Malaysia&#x27;s racial tensions based on aiding the Malays economically through an affirmative action programme.

This included the New Economic Policy and the creation of Kuala Lumpur as a Federal Territory out of Selangor state in 1974, five years later.

After the riots, Abdul Rahman was forced into the background, with the day-to-day running of the country handed to the deputy prime minister, Abdul Razak Hussein, who was also the director of the NOC. On 22 September 1970, when the parliament reconvened, Abdul Rahman resigned his position as prime minister, and Razak Hussein took over.

In his 2007 book, &quot;May 13: Declassified Documents on the Malaysian Riots of 1969&quot;, Kua Kia Soong argued that, based on declassified British embassy dispatches, the riot was a coup d&#x27;état staged against Tunku Abdul Rahman by UMNO political leaders in association with the army and the police.

In an attempt to form a broader coalition, the Barisan Nasional was formed in place of the Alliance Party, with former opposition parties such as Gerakan, PPP, and PAS invited to join the coalition.

After the 1969 riot, UMNO also began to restructure the political system to reinforce its power. It advanced its own version of &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot;, whereby &quot;the politics of this country has been, and must remain for the foreseeable future, native [i.e., Malay] based: that was the secret of our stability and our prosperity and that is a fact of political life which no one can simply wish away.&quot; This principle of &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; has been repeatedly used in successive elections by UMNO to galvanise Malay support for the party, and it remained the guiding principle of successive governments.

<text>Earl of Portland is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England, firstly in 1633 and secondly in 1689. What proved to be a long co-held title, Duke of Portland, was created in 1716 and became extinct in 1990 upon the death of the ninth Duke, at which point the earldom passed to the most senior agnatic (solely male-line) cousin, namely one of the 6th degree.

==First creation (1633)==
The title of Earl of Portland was first created for the politician Richard Weston, 1st Baron Weston, in 1633. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1621 to 1628 and Lord High Treasurer from 1628 to 1635. He had already been created Baron Weston of Nayland in the County of Suffolk in 1628; this title was also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He served as Joint Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. His son, the third Earl, was killed at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665. He was unmarried and was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was childless and on his death in 1688, the titles became extinct.

==Second creation (1689)==

The title was created for a second time in 1689 in favour of William Bentinck, the Dutch favourite and close advisor of King William III. He was made Baron Cirencester and Viscount Woodstock at the same time he was given the earldom, also in the Peerage of England.

The first Earl was succeeded in 1709 by his son from his first marriage, Henry Bentinck, who became the second Earl. He had represented Southampton and Hampshire in the House of Commons. In 1716, he was created Marquess of Titchfield and Duke of Portland in the Peerage of Great Britain.

His grandson, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, was a noted politician. He was Prime Minister in 1783 and from 1807 to 1809, and he also served as Home Secretary and as Lord President of the Council. In 1801, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Cavendish (to form Cavendish-Bentinck). He was the husband of Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, and was a descendant on his mother&#x27;s side of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

The third Duke was succeeded by his eldest son, William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland. The fourth Duke was also a politician and served as Lord Privy Seal in 1827 and as Lord President of the Council from 1827 to 1828. He married Henrietta Scott, daughter of Major-General John Scott, in 1795 and assumed by Royal licence the same year the additional surname of Scott in the manner of Cavendish-Bentinck. His eldest son and heir apparent, William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, Marquess of Titchfield, represented two constituencies in Parliament but died unmarried in 1824, 15 years before his father. The fourth Duke was therefore succeeded by his second son, William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland. The fifth Duke is remembered as a capable architect and engineer but eccentric, who excavated an underground art gallery and library under his estate at Welbeck Abbey.

The fifth Duke died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland, who was the only son from the first marriage of Lieutenant-General Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck, younger son of Lord Charles Bentinck, the third son of the third Duke. Charles&#x27; first son, also named Charles, was a maternal great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1880, the sixth Duke also succeeded his stepmother as second Baron Bolsover. He was a Conservative politician and served as Master of the Horse from 1886 to 1892 and from 1895 to 1905.

His eldest son, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland, was also a Conservative politician and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1927 to 1929 and in 1932. The seventh Duke had no sons and was succeeded by his third cousin, Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck, 8th Duke of Portland, a great-grandson of Major-General Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, fourth son of the third Duke. The barony of Bolsover became extinct upon the death of the seventh Duke. 

The great estates which had been entailed with the dukedom for generations, including Welbeck Abbey, were separated from the title by the sixth Duke, who broke the entail and created a trust which ultimately ensured that his granddaughter Lady Anne Cavendish-Bentinck inherited the ducal wealth on the death of her father, the seventh duke.

The eighth Duke was a colonial administrator in British Kenya and served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Kenya. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland, a diplomat who had served as British Ambassador to Poland. The ninth Duke&#x27;s only son, William James Cavendish-Bentinck (1925–1966), died before him without issue. Upon the ninth Duke&#x27;s death in 1990 at the age of 93, the dukedom of Portland and the marquessate of Titchfield became extinct.

The ninth Duke was succeeded in his other peerages by his sixth cousin, Henry Bentinck, 11th Earl of Portland. He was the great-great-great-great-grandson of Willem Bentinck, 1st Count Bentinck (1704–1774), eldest son of the first Earl from his second marriage, who had been created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1732 (with a Royal licence of 1886 to use the title in England). , the titles are held by his only son, the twelfth Earl, born in Australia, who is also Count Bentinck of the Holy Roman Empire. He is an actor known by his professional name, Tim Bentinck.

==Other members of the Cavendish-Bentinck family==
Several other members of the Cavendish-Bentinck family have also gained distinction. Lord William Bentinck, second son of the third Duke, was a prominent soldier, politician and colonial administrator. The aforementioned Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck was a lieutenant-general in the British Army. His grandson Lord Henry Cavendish-Bentinck was a Conservative politician. Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, fourth son of the third Duke, was a major-general in the army and a Tory MP. His only son George Cavendish-Bentinck was a Conservative politician. Lord George Bentinck, fifth son of the fourth Duke, was a Tory politician. John Charles Bentinck, grandson of the Hon. William Bentinck, eldest son from the second marriage of the 1st Earl, was also a major-general in the army. His younger son Sir Henry John William Bentinck was also a noted soldier. Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, wife of the second Duke, was a wealthy heiress and collector. Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, maternal grandmother of Elizabeth II, was a Cavendish-Bentinck before marriage.

==Seat==
The seat of the Dukes of Portland was Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire. Welbeck Abbey and its many acres continued in the senior branch of the family (becoming Cavendish-Bentinck) through the ancestry of a daughter of the 7th Duke. The mansion was in the early 21st century restored as a family home after many years of institutional use. The Dukes of Portland also owned the village of Pegswood in Northumberland.

The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland at Welbeck Abbey was the churchyard of St Winifred&#x27;s Church in the nearby village of Holbeck.

<text>Tayside () was one of the nine regions used for local government in Scotland from 16 May 1975 to 31 March 1996. The region was named after the River Tay.

==History==

Tayside region was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts, following recommendations made by the 1969 Wheatley Report. Tayside region covered the whole area of the counties of Angus, Dundee (which was a county of a city), Kinross-shire and most of Perthshire. Tayside region was divided into three districts: Angus, Dundee, and Perth and Kinross.

Tayside region was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. Each of Tayside&#x27;s three districts became a separate council area, with some adjustments to boundaries around Dundee.

Tayside Regional Council directly operated local bus services in the City of Dundee from 1975 until 1986, when bus deregulation under terms of the Transport Act 1985 was implemented. The restructured Tayside Buses became employee-owned in 1991, was sold to National Express in 1997 and McGill&#x27;s Bus Services in 2020, and today trades as Xplore Dundee.

Tayside continues to have a joint electoral, valuation, and health board. It retained its police and fire services until they were merged, on 1 April 2013, into bodies known as Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, which cover the whole of Scotland. Provision of healthcare across the region also continues via NHS Tayside.

Angus Council, Dundee City Council and Perth and Kinross Council formed Tayside Contracts as their commercial arm and to provide shared services, such as road and housing maintenance, winter maintenance (snow clearing and gritting), catering and cleaning services across the former Tayside area. Tayside Contracts services are open to the public and all profits from the company are equally fed back into each of the three councils to bolster revenue to the local authorities to provide cash for services as a boost to central government and council tax income.

==Political control==
The first election to the regional council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council were:

===Elections===

Election results were as follows:

==Premises==

The regional council established its headquarters at Tayside House at 28 Crichton Street in Dundee. It was already under construction when the council was created, and the council started moving into the building in May 1976. After the regional council&#x27;s abolition, ownership of the building passed to the three successor councils. Dundee City Council bought out the other two councils&#x27; interests in the building in 1997 and used it as its own offices until 2011, after which the building was demolished.

<text>Grampian () was one of nine local government regions of Scotland. It was created in 1975 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and took its name from the Grampian Mountains. The regional council was based in Aberdeen.

The region was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which divided the region into the three single-tier council areas of Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, and Moray.

== History ==
The Grampian region was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which created a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland. Grampian covered the combined area of four former counties, which were abolished for local government purposes at the same time:
* Aberdeenshire
* Aberdeen (which was a county of a city)
* Kincardineshire
* Moray (except Grantown-on-Spey and Cromdale, which went to Highland region)

Grampian was divided into five districts: City of Aberdeen, Banff and Buchan, Gordon, Kincardine and Deeside and Moray.

Grampian region was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary authorities. The region was divided into three single-tier council areas. The former City of Aberdeen and Moray districts each became council areas (although &#x27;City of Aberdeen&#x27; was renamed &#x27;Aberdeen City&#x27; to coincide with the reforms), and Banff and Buchan, Gordon, and Kincardine and Deeside merged into a new Aberdeenshire council area.

== Geography ==
The Grampian region was encompassed almost all of what could be considered the north-east of Scotland. 
Aberdeen was the major city of the region. Other major towns are the former royal burgh of Elgin, the major fishing port of Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Inverurie, Westhill, Stonehaven, Forres, Ellon and Portlethen. Grampian Regional Council was based at Woodhill House, Westburn Road, Aberdeen.

== Political control ==
The first election to the regional council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:
===Leadership===
The conveners of the council were:

=== Elections ===
Election results were as follows:

== Modern day use ==
Grampian continues to have a regional NHS board. The region also had a regional fire and rescue service and Police service before they were merged into Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Police Scotland respectively in 2013. Grampian also had its own Television region called Grampian Television until it was dissolved and incorporated in STV North in 2006.

== Successor council areas ==
==Premises==

The regional council was based at Woodhill House in the western suburbs of Aberdeen. The site had formerly been occupied by a large house, which had been bought by the old Aberdeenshire County Council in 1967. The new building was designed in 1971 to be a headquarters for the county council, to replace its old offices at County Buildings in the centre of Aberdeen. The possibility that local government reform may be coming was taken into account in the design of the building, which was completed and occupied in phases from early 1975 onwards. An official opening ceremony for the building was held in May 1977.

On the abolition of the regional council in 1996 the building passed to the new Aberdeenshire Council.

<text>Ernest Bramah (20 March 186823 June 1942), the pseudonym of Ernest Brammah Smith, was an English author. He published 21 books and numerous short stories and features. His humorous works were often ranked with Jerome K. Jerome and W. W. Jacobs, his detective stories with Conan Doyle, his politico-science fiction with H. G. Wells, and his supernatural stories with Algernon Blackwood. George Orwell acknowledged that Bramah&#x27;s book &quot;What Might Have Been&quot; influenced his &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Bramah created the characters Kai Lung and Max Carrados.

==Early career==
Ernest Brammah Smith (the spelling of his middle name on his birth certificate was recorded by the register as &#x27;Brammah&#x27;, not &#x27;Bramah&#x27;) was born in Manchester, England in 1868, the son of Charles Clement Smith and Susannah (Brammah) Smith. Aged 16, he quit Manchester Grammar School, having been near the bottom in each subject. He became a farmer, first as a pupil and then in his own right. He was assisted financially by his father, who had transformed in a short time from a factory hand to a wealthy man. The farming enterprise cost his father £100,000 in modern money, but it was while farming that Bramah began to contribute local vignettes to the &quot;Birmingham News&quot;. Later he wrote a satirical book about his adventures in farming. It had few buyers, and was remaindered and pulped, though his father agreed to assist him financially while he made his way in Grub Street as a writer. He eventually obtained a position as secretary to Jerome K. Jerome and became editor of one of Jerome&#x27;s magazines. After quitting Jerome, Smith edited other journals for a publishing business that later went bankrupt.

==Writing career==

Bramah attained commercial and critical success with his creation of Kai Lung, an itinerant storyteller. He first appears in &quot;The Wallet of Kai Lung&quot; which was rejected by eight publishers before Grant Richards published it in 1900. It was still in print a hundred years later. The Kai Lung stories are humorous tales set in China, often with fantasy elements such as dragons and gods.

With Kai Lung, Bramah developed a style of narration typified by the following passages:
*&quot;Kai Lung rose guardedly to his feet, with many gestures of polite assurance and having bowed several times to indicate his pacific nature, he stood in an attitude of deferential admiration. At this display the elder and less attractive of the maidens fled, uttering loud and continuous cries of apprehension to conceal the direction of her flight&quot;.
*&quot;In particular, there is among this august crowd of Mandarins one Wang Yu, who has departed on three previous occasions without bestowing the reward of a single cash. If the feeble and covetous Wang Yu will place in his very ordinary bowl the price of one of his exceedingly ill-made pipes, this unworthy person will proceed.&quot;
*&quot;After secretly observing the unstudied grace of her movements, the most celebrated picture-maker of the province burned the implements of his craft, and began life anew as a trainer of performing elephants.&quot;

The Kai Lung stories include many proverbs and aphorisms, such as the following:
* &quot;He who lacks a single tael sees many bargains&quot;
* &quot;It is a mark of insincerity of purpose to spend one’s time in looking for the sacred Emperor in low-class teashops&quot;
* &quot;It has been said there are few situations in life that cannot be honourably settled, and without loss of time, either by suicide, a bag of gold or by thrusting a despised antagonist over the edge of a precipice on a dark night&quot;

Bramah also wrote political science fiction. &quot;What Might Have Been&quot;, published in 1907 and republished as &quot;The Secret of the League&quot; in 1909, is an anti-socialist dystopia representing Bramah&#x27;s conservative political opinions. It was acknowledged by George Orwell as a source for &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Orwell credited it with giving a considerably accurate prediction of the rise of Fascism.

At a time when the English Channel had yet to be crossed by an aeroplane, Bramah foresaw aerial express trains traveling at 10,000 feet, a nationwide wireless-telegraphy network, a prototype fax machine and a cypher typewriter similar to the German Enigma machine. 

In 1914, Bramah created Max Carrados, a blind detective. Given the outlandish idea that a blind man could be a detective, in the introduction to the second Carrados book &quot;The Eyes of Max Carrados,&quot; Bramah compared his hero&#x27;s achievements to those of real-life blind people such as Nicholas Saunderson, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, Blind Jack of Knaresborough the road builder, John Fielding the Bow Street Magistrate (of whom it was said he could identify 3,000 thieves by their voices), and Helen Keller.

In 1929, Bramah wrote the book &quot;English Regal Copper Coins&quot; which was published by Methuen. The book concentrates on British copper coinage from 1671 during the reign of Charles II until the end of pure copper coin production in 1860. The book is still used widely by numismatic auction houses throughout the world with Bramah reference numbers. The section on coin rarity as a percentage of production for each year is still considered useful to date.

==&quot;Interesting times&quot; and other quotations==
Bramah has been credited with the invention of the saying, quoted often as an ancient Chinese curse, &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot;, along with &quot;May you come to the attention of those in authority&quot; and &quot;May you find what you are looking for&quot;. However, these do not appear in the Kai Lung stories.

==Archives at Harry Ransom Center==

Bramah&#x27;s manuscripts, correspondence and additional materials including his work for Jerome K. Jerome and as staff member for the magazine &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Idler&quot; and the Grosvenor Press are held at the University of Texas Harry Ransom Center. A letter of 27 April 1923 from Bramah to Grant Richards explains that he had never been to China.

==Personal life and death==
Bramah was a very private man who did not make public any details of his personal life. He was married to Lucy Maisie Smith. He died at the age of 74 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, leaving an estate valued at £15,172 (£ as of 2025). After his death, his widow presented a collection of all his published books to the Hammersmith borough libraries, for reference use only. Bramah had lived in Hammersmith for some 30 years, not far from Ravenscourt Park.

<doc id="439862" wikidata="Q1156152" url="?curid=439862" title="Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.">
<text>Thomas Ludwig John D&#x27;Alesandro Jr. (August 1, 1903 – August 23, 1987) was an American politician who served as the 41st mayor of Baltimore from 1947 to 1959. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1939 until 1947. He was known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was the patriarch of the D&#x27;Alesandro political family, which includes Nancy Pelosi, the 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives; and Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro III, the 44th mayor of Baltimore.

==Early life==
D&#x27;Alesandro was born in Baltimore on August 1, 1903. He was the son of Maria Antonia Petronilla (née Foppiani) and Tommaso F. D&#x27;Alessandro. His father was born in Montenerodomo, Abruzzo, Italy, and his mother was born in Baltimore, to parents from Genoa, Liguria, Italy. D&#x27;Alesandro attended Calvert Business College in Baltimore. Before beginning his political career, he worked as an insurance and real estate broker.

==Career==
D&#x27;Alesandro served as a member of the Maryland State House of Delegates from 1926 to 1933. After serving in Annapolis, D&#x27;Alesandro was then appointed as General Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue, a post in which he served during 1933–1934. He then was elected to serve on the Baltimore City Council from 1935 to 1938.

D&#x27;Alesandro was then elected to the 76th Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1939, until he resigned on May 16, 1947. While in Congress, D&#x27;Alesandro strongly supported the Bergson Group, a &quot;political action committee set up to challenge the Roosevelt Administration&#x27;s policies on the Jewish refugee issue during the Holocaust, and later lobbied against British control of Palestine&quot; despite his equally strong support for Roosevelt&#x27;s other policies.

Following his service in Congress he was the Mayor of Baltimore for 12 years from May 1947 to May 1959. D&#x27;Alesandro served on the Federal Renegotiation Board from 1961 to 1969 after being appointed by President John F. Kennedy. On September 21, 1966, President Lyndon Baines Johnson&#x27;s assistant Mildred Stegall requested a routine FBI name check on D&#x27;Alesandro. FBI records released on January 6, 2021 showed D&#x27;Alesandro had been the subject of a Special Inquiry investigation in March and April 1961, revealing numerous allegations of association with criminals in Baltimore.

===Political campaigns===
D&#x27;Alesandro was a strong contender for Governor of Maryland in 1954, but dropped out after being implicated in receiving undeclared money from Dominic Piracci, a parking garage owner convicted of fraud, conspiracy, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Piracci was the father of Margie Piracci D&#x27;Alesandro, the wife of D&#x27;Alesandro&#x27;s oldest son and namesake Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro III. Mayor D&#x27;Alesandro was later exonerated and never indicted.

After withdrawing, D&#x27;Alesandro tacitly supported University of Maryland President Curley Byrd, who lost, 54.5% to 45.5%, to Theodore McKeldin, the Republican incumbent and D&#x27;Alesandro&#x27;s predecessor as Mayor of Baltimore.

In 1958, D&#x27;Alesandro ran for the United States Senate in a bid to defeat Republican incumbent J. Glenn Beall. D&#x27;Alesandro first had to spend money and time defeating perennial candidate/contractor George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary. D&#x27;Alesandro then ran a strong campaign, losing to Beall in a close race, the first election D&#x27;Alesandro had ever lost.

In 1959, D&#x27;Alesandro was defeated in a bid for another term for Mayor of Baltimore by J. Harold Grady.

===Retrospective analysis===
In 2017, in an effort to counter D&#x27;Alesandro&#x27;s daughter Nancy&#x27;s efforts to remove statues of Confederate figures from the halls of Congress, conservative commentators noted that in 1948, D&#x27;Alesandro dedicated the Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee Monument in his capacity as Mayor of Baltimore, along with the then-Governor of Maryland, William Preston Lane Jr. His son, Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro III, who later served as Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971, said about his father &quot;His whole life was politics. He was not what you would call a flaming liberal, but he was a progressive.&quot;

==Personal life==
D&#x27;Alesandro was married to Annunciata M. (&quot;Nancy&quot;) Lombardi (1909–1995). Together, the couple had six children, five sons and a daughter:

* Thomas Ludwig John D&#x27;Alesandro III (1929–2019), attorney and politician who served as the mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971.
* Nicholas M. D&#x27;Alesandro (1930–1934)
* Franklin Delano Roosevelt D&#x27;Alesandro (1933–2007), who also served in the U.S. Army.
* Hector Joseph D&#x27;Alesandro (1935–1995)
* Joseph Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro (1937–2004)
* Nancy Patricia D&#x27;Alesandro Pelosi (born 1940), politician who served as the speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011 and from 2019 to 2023; she is the first woman elected Speaker and the first woman in American history to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress.

D&#x27;Alesandro did not speak Italian but spoke Yiddish. 

Two months after being present at Nancy&#x27;s swearing in as a congresswoman, D&#x27;Alesandro died on August 23, 1987, in Baltimore, Maryland.

<doc id="439863" wikidata="Q160196" url="?curid=439863" title="Martin Heinrich Klaproth">
<text>Martin Heinrich Klaproth (1 December 1743 – 1 January 1817) was a German chemist. He trained and worked for much of his life as an apothecary, moving in later life to the university. His shop became the second-largest apothecary in Berlin, and the most productive artisanal chemical research center in Europe.

Klaproth was a major systematizer of analytical chemistry, and an independent inventor of gravimetric analysis. His attention to detail and refusal to ignore discrepancies in results led to improvements in the use of apparatus. He was a major figure in understanding the composition of minerals and characterizing the elements. 
Klaproth discovered uranium (1789) 
and zirconium (1789). 
He was also involved in the discovery or co-discovery of 
titanium (1795), 
strontium (1793), 
cerium (1803), and 
chromium (1797) and confirmed the previous discoveries of 
tellurium (1798) and 
beryllium (1798).

Klaproth was a member and director of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He was recognized internationally as a member of the Royal Society in London, the Institut de France, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Career==
Klaproth was born in Wernigerode. He was the son of a tailor, and attended the Latin school at Wernigerode for four years.

For much of his life he followed the profession of apothecary. In 1759, when he was 16 years old, he apprenticed at Quedlinburg. In 1764, he became a journeyman. He trained in pharmacies at Quedlinburg (1759–1766); Hanover (1766–1768, with August Hermann Brande); Berlin (1768); and Danzig (1770).

In 1771, Klaproth returned to Berlin to work for Valentin Rose the Elder as manager of his business. Following Rose&#x27;s death, Klaproth passed the required examinations to become senior manager. Following his marriage in 1780, he was able to buy his own establishment, the Apotheke zum Baren. Between 1782 and 1800, Klaproth published 84 papers based on researches carried out in the Apotheke&#x27;s laboratory. His shop was the most productive site of artisanal chemistry investigations in Europe at that time.

Beginning in 1782, he was the assessor of pharmacy for the examining board of the Ober-Collegium Medicum. In 1787 Klaproth was appointed lecturer in chemistry to the Prussian Royal Artillery.

In 1788, Klaproth became an unsalaried member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1800, he became the salaried director of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He sold the apothecary and moved to the academy, where he convinced the university to build a new laboratory. Upon completion in 1802, Klaproth moved the equipment from his apothecary laboratory into the new building.
When the University of Berlin was founded in 1810 he was selected to be the professor of chemistry.

He died in Berlin on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1817.

==Contributions==
An exact and conscientious worker, Klaproth did much to improve and systematise the processes of analytical chemistry and mineralogy. His appreciation of the value of quantitative methods led him to become one of the earliest adherents of the Lavoisierian doctrines outside France.

Klaproth was the first to discover uranium, identifying it first in torbernite but doing the majority of his research on it with the mineral pitchblende. 
On 24 September 1789 he announced his discovery to the Royal Prussian Academy of sciences in Berlin. He also discovered zirconium in 1789, separating it in the form of its &quot;earth&quot; zirconia, oxide ZrO. Klaproth analyzed a brightly-colored form of the mineral called &quot;hyacinth&quot; from Ceylon. He gave the new element the name zirconium based on its Persian name &quot;zargun&quot;, gold-colored.

Klaproth characterised uranium and zirconium as distinct elements, though he was unable to isolate them.

Klaproth independently discovered cerium (1803), a rare earth element, around the same time as Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, in the winter of 1803.

William Gregor of Cornwall was the first to identify the element titanium in 1791, correctly concluding that he had found a new element in the ore ilmenite from the Menachan valley. He proposed the name &quot;menachanite&quot;, but his discovery attracted little attention. 
Klaproth verified the presence of an oxide of an unknown element in the ore rutile from Hungary in 1795. Klaproth suggested the name &quot;titanium&quot;. It was later determined that menachanite and titanium were the same element, from two different minerals, and Klaproth&#x27;s name was adopted.

Klaproth clarified the composition of numerous substances until then imperfectly known, including compounds of then newly recognised elements tellurium, strontium and chromium.

Chromium was discovered in 1797 by Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and independently discovered in 1798 by Klaproth and by Tobias Lowitz, in a mineral from the Ural mountains. Klaproth confirmed chromium&#x27;s independent status as an element.

The existence of tellurium was first suggested in 1783 by Franz-Joseph Mueller von Reichenstein, an Austrian mining engineer who was examining Transylvanian gold samples. Tellurium was also discovered independently by Hungarian Pál Kitaibel in 1789. Mueller sent some of his mineral to Klaproth in 1796. Klaproth isolated the new substance and confirmed the identification of the new element tellurium in 1798. He credited Mueller as its discoverer, and suggested that the heavy metal be named &quot;tellus&quot;, Latin for &#x27;earth&#x27;.

In 1790 Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank determined that the mineral strontianite, found near Strontian in Scotland, was different from barium-based minerals. 
Klaproth was one of several scientists involved in the characterization of strontium compounds and minerals. 
Klaproth, Thomas Charles Hope, and 
Richard Kirwan independently studied and reported on the properties of strontianite, the preparation of compounds of strontium, and their differentiation from those of barium. In September 1793, Klaproth published on the separation of strontium from barium, and in 1794 on the preparation of strontium oxide and strontium hydroxide. 
In 1808, Humphry Davy became the first to successfully isolate the pure element.

Louis Nicolas Vauquelin reported the existence of a new element common to emerald and beryl in 1798, and suggested that it be named &quot;glucine&quot;. Klaproth confirmed the presence of a new element, and became involved in a lengthy and ongoing debate over its name by suggesting &quot;beryllia&quot;. The element was first isolated in 1828, independently by Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy. Only in 1949 did IUPAC rule exclusively in favor of the name beryllium.

Klaproth published extensively, collecting over 200 papers by himself in &quot;Beiträge zur chemischen Kenntnis der Mineralkörper&quot; (5 vols., 1795–1810) and &quot;Chemische Abhandlungen gemischten Inhalts&quot; (1815). He also published a &quot;Chemisches Wörterbuch&quot; (1807–1810), and edited a revised edition of F. A. C. Gren&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch der Chemie&quot; (1806).

Klaproth became a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1795, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1804.
He also belonged to the Institut de France.

The crater Klaproth on the Moon is named after him.

In 1823, botanist Carl Sigismund Kunth published a genus of flowering plants (belonging to the family Loasaceae), from Central America as &quot;Klaprothia&quot; in his honour.

His son Julius was a famous orientalist.

<text>Haskovo ( ) is a city in the region of Northern Thrace in southern Bulgaria and the administrative centre of the Haskovo Province, not far from the borders with Greece and Turkey. According to Operative Program Regional Development of Bulgaria, the urban area of Haskovo is the seventh largest in Bulgaria and has a population of 184,731 inhabitants. Haskovo has a population of 64,564 as of 2022, making it Bulgaria&#x27;s 12th largest city.

The first settlement found in Haskovo is from circa 5000 BC. Haskovo celebrated its 1,000th anniversary as a town in 1985. To mark the event, a new clock tower was erected in the centre of the town.

Haskovo Cove in Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named after the city of Haskovo.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Haskovo has a temperate climate (Köppen: Cfa, Trewartha: Do), closely bordring on a continental climate, with an average yearly temperature of about . Winters are cold, albeit not as snowy as the western and northern parts of the country. Summers are hot, and late-summer is somewhat dry.

==Etymology==
The name of the town is derived from its earlier Ottoman-era name &quot;Hasköy&quot;, which is a hybrid Arabic-Turkish compound meaning &quot;special village&quot; (Turkish &quot;has&quot; &quot;special&quot; via Arabic خَاصّ + Turkish &quot;köy&quot; &quot;village&quot;). It was so named after it became the centre of an Ottoman administrative district in the region. The ancient Thracian name of the settlement was &quot;Marsa (&quot;Greek&quot;:&quot; Μάρσα&quot;)&quot;, by which it was known until as late as 1782. By 1830, it was known by its Turkish name, &quot;Hasköy&quot;. The Bulgarian (and common Slavic) placename suffix &quot;-ovo&quot; replaced the Turkish &quot;köy&quot; after the city switched to Bulgarian from Ottoman rule.

==History==
According to archeologists, the area of Haskovo was originally settled about seven thousand years ago. In and around Haskovo, evidence has been preserved that confirms its long history during the prehistoric, Thracian, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine periods. In the 9th century – during the First Bulgarian Empire – a fortress was built in Haskovo that soon was transformed into a town. The town was located at the centre of a sizable region between the Klokotnitsa, Harmanliyska, and Maritsa rivers.

===Ottoman era===
The village and surrounding area became part of the Ottoman Empire shortly after the conquest of Edirne in 1361. During the time of Mehmed the Conqueror, Hasköy, as it was then known, was settled by around 750 people, consisting of 150 Muslim families spread across 12 neighbourhoods: Hacı Mahmud, Îsâ Fakih, Sofular, Saraç İnebey, Saraç Musa, Hacı Kayalı, Cüllâh, Hacı İsmâil, Kadı, Debbâğlar, Hacı Bayezid and Dervişan. The village acquired a largely agricultural character during most of the Ottoman period; there was also a thriving cottage industry and craftsmen such as saddlers, tanners, shoemakers, furriers and soapmakers, dyers, and chandlers made their home in Hasköy. In 1515 the population increased to 1400 people in 274 households, and in 1530 it was recorded that there was one Friday mosque (&quot;cami&quot;) as well as six smaller mosques in the village.

In 1592, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha commissioned the building of two caravanserais, two baths, shops, a mosque and an almshouse at the request of the people. According to the Austrian historian and orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, Sinan Pasha also inaugurated the nearby Uzuncaova (Uzundzhovo) fair, which would become famous in all of Ottoman Bulgaria.

The town&#x27;s importance increased in the 19th century. With its markets and fairs Hasköy became a significant centre of commerce in the Sanjak (District) of Filibe. At the same time, an increasing number of Bulgarians and other minorities came to settle in the town. By the second half of the century the population had grown to about 6000 people, of whom 3500 were non-Muslims and only 2500 were Turks. In the 1870s Hasköy was a hotbed of revolutionary activity during the Bulgarian National Revival and subsequent Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, after which &quot;de facto&quot; Ottoman control of the town came to an end.

===Modern era===

Haskovo was part of Eastern Rumelia from 1878–1885, and was then incorporated into the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria, which declared full independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. It was renamed Haskovo after Bulgarian independence.

After the liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878, the Haskovo region became popular for high-quality tobacco production. However, presently there is no cigarette production in the region anymore after the once big Tobacco company &quot;Haskovo-BT&quot; closed in 2005. Currently, the biggest enterprises produce food, machinery, and textiles.

== Population ==
The population of Haskovo was 14,191 in 1887. Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns. It reached its peak in the period 1987–1991, when the population exceeded 90,000.In December 2017, Haskovo&#x27;s population was 71,214 people within the city limits. The Haskovo Municipality, with the legally affiliated adjacent villages, had a population of 87,780.

===Ethnic and religious composition===

According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:
*Bulgarians: 54,869 (79.3%)

*Others: 400 (0.8%)
*Indefinable: 709 (0.7%)

Total: 76,397

In Haskovo Municipality 63,963 declared as Bulgarians, 16,890 as Turks, 3859 as Roma and 8,984 did not declare their ethnic group. Most of the 28,444 Turks (12.5%) in Haskovo Province are concentrated within the city and the municipality, while the Bulgarians have a higher proportion in the province than the city, numbering 180,541 (79.4%).

According to the 2001 census, the Orthodox Christians are around 80% vs. around 20% Muslims.

==Culture==
The most notable cultural landmarks in Haskovo are the &quot;Ivan Dimov&quot; drama theater, renovated in 2004, the Museum of History, and an art gallery. The annual Colourful Thrace Sings and Dances folk festival takes place in the nearby park Kenana.

A 32-metre-high monument of the Mother of God and the Infant Jesus was erected on the Hill of Youth near Haskovo in 2003. The monument was inaugurated on 8 September on the occasion of the Nativity of Holy Virgin Mary, when the day of the town of Haskovo is celebrated. It was entered into the Guinness Book of Records as the highest monument to the Mother of God in the world.

Haskovo has recently invested in renovating its town center, with a variety of new sculptures and fountains erected.

Municipal landmarks include the Thracian Aleksandrovo tomb as well as Uzundzhovo&#x27;s Church of the Assumption, built originally as a mosque during Ottoman times. In 1395 the &quot;Eski cami&quot; (the Old Mosque) was built as one of the first in the Balkans. Its minaret is slightly inclined.

=== Sacred architecture ===
* The monument &quot;Holy Mother of God&quot; entered the Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s tallest statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Infant. The monument was erected with respect, love and gratitude to the Mother of God. It was opened in 2003 with the consecration of water by Metropolitan Arseniy. In 2005 it was entered in the Guinness Book of World Records, and since 2009 it is in the list of the Hundred National Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.
* The bell tower - with impressive dimensions and unforgettable views rises above the town of Haskovo. The almost 29-meter-high bell tower was erected in 2010 next to the Holy Mother of God monument and quickly took its place in the resulting architectural ensemble.
* The Old Mosque (Eski Mosque) is the earliest mosque in the Bulgarian lands. It was built immediately after the invasion of the Ottoman Turks in Bulgaria, in the year 797 AH (1395 AD). In 1968 the Eski Mosque was declared a cultural monument. Currently, the mosque is significantly dug into the ground (probably due to the rising level of the surrounding streets).
* The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin in the village of Uzundzhovo, near Haskovo, is unique not only in its architecture, but also in the history it tells. Created as a Christian temple, it was destroyed by the Ottoman Empire and a mosque was built in its place. At the beginning of the 20th century, Turkey returned the property to Bulgaria and then began the reconstruction of the mosque into a church. In 2007 the church was restored mainly by the Municipality of Haskovo. During the restoration, two medieval inscriptions in Arabic with religious and philosophical themes were found, which have not yet been precisely dated. In the last century, the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the village of Uzundzhovo was declared a cultural monument.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Haskovo is twinned with:

* Edirne, Turkey
* Enguera, Spain
* Leicester, England, United Kingdom
* Shatura, Russia
* Veszprém, Hungary
* Viseu, Portugal
==Economy==

The branch structure of the economy of Haskovo municipality is diverse and consists of Bulgarian and international companies of different sizes. These companies sell their products in both foreign and domestic markets.

The future development of the municipality is related to the full use of natural and climatic conditions in the field of agriculture - efforts to develop promising market-oriented agricultural production, creation of agricultural consulting centers and others. The historical features and the rich culture of the region, in combination with the well-developed transport and tourist infrastructure, are a favorable factor for the development of tourism. The partnership relations established by the municipality with cities from England, Austria, France, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the US, Russia, Serbia, Belarus also have a valuable contribution in this respect.

<doc id="439875" wikidata="Q624356" url="?curid=439875" title="California State Route 91">
<text>State Route 91 (SR 91) is a major east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California that serves several regions of the Greater Los Angeles urban area. A freeway throughout its entire length, it officially runs from Vermont Avenue in Gardena, just west of the junction with the Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110, I-110), east to Riverside at the junction with the Pomona (SR 60 west of SR 91) and Moreno Valley (SR 60 and I-215 east of SR 91) freeways.

Though signs along the portion from Vermont Avenue west to Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) in Hermosa Beach along Artesia Boulevard are still signed as SR 91, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) no longer controls this portion of the highway, as this segment was relinquished to local jurisdictions in 2003.

SR 91 inherited its route number from the mostly decommissioned U.S. Route 91 (US 91), which passed through the Inland Empire in a northeasterly direction on its way to Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and points beyond. Those segments of US 91 are now parallel to, or have been replaced altogether by, I-15.

==Route description==
From the Harbor Freeway (I-110) to its interchange with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) in northern Long Beach, SR 91 is named the Gardena Freeway. Between the Long Beach Freeway and its interchange with the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) in Buena Park, it is named the Artesia Freeway. From the Santa Ana Freeway to its eastern terminus at the interchange of the Pomona, Moreno Valley, and Escondido Freeways, it is named the Riverside Freeway.

Control cities on the route vary by location. Heading westbound, between SR 60/I-215 and the Orange County line, the control city is Beach Cities. With SR 241 heading towards Irvine, Laguna Beach, and the rest of south Orange County, the control city becomes Los Angeles between the Orange–Riverside county line and I-5. I-5 directs travelers to Los Angeles so between I-5 and Pioneer Boulevard, the control city is Artesia. Between Pioneer Boulevard and SR 1, the control city becomes Beach Cities again besides Carmenita Road in Cerritos, the control city is in Long Beach. Heading eastbound, the control city for the entire route is Riverside. The Beach Cities control city may have to do with SR 91&#x27;s former western terminus in Hermosa Beach.

SR 91 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 91 is part of the State Scenic Highway System from SR 55 to the east city limit of Anaheim, in the western part of the Santa Ana Canyon, and is eligible for the system through the canyon to Interstate 15.

===Gardena Freeway===
The Gardena Freeway is a freeway in southern Los Angeles County. It is the westernmost freeway portion of State Route 91. It begins just west of the Harbor Freeway at the intersection with Vermont Avenue in the eastern edge of the city of Gardena, proceeding eastward approximately six miles (10 km) until it intersects the Long Beach Freeway. Thereafter, SR 91 is known as the Artesia Freeway.

Until 1991, the Gardena Freeway was known as the Redondo Beach Freeway. The name change reflected the successful efforts of the cities of Torrance and Redondo Beach to block the extension of the freeway westward to its intended terminus at the cancelled Pacific Coast Freeway in Redondo Beach. In 1997, the California government dedicated the portion of SR 91 between Alameda Street and Central Avenue to former assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr.

===Artesia Freeway===
The Artesia Freeway is a freeway in southeastern Los Angeles County and northwestern Orange County. It runs east–west from its western terminus at the Long Beach Freeway in northern Long Beach to its eastern terminus at the Santa Ana Freeway in Buena Park. (SR 91 continues west of the Long Beach Freeway as the Gardena Freeway, and east of the Santa Ana Freeway as the Riverside Freeway.) The &quot;Artesia Freeway&quot; name originally was assigned to the entire length of SR 91 west of the Santa Ana Freeway in the early 1970s since it was, in sense, the freeway realignment of SR 91 from the paralleling Artesia Boulevard.

During the 1984 Summer Olympics, a stretch of the highway was home to the cycling men&#x27;s road team time trial event.

As the only freeway to link Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, SR 91 is one of the most heavily congested routes in Southern California.

===Riverside Freeway===


Between the Santa Ana Freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5), in Buena Park and the 91 Freeway&#x27;s eastern terminus at a junction with Interstate 215 and State Route 60 in Riverside, the 91 Freeway&#x27;s assigned name is the Riverside Freeway. Past the I-215/SR 60/SR 91 junction, the Riverside Freeway continues as I-215.

The freeway through the Santa Ana Canyon is paralleled by the 91/Perris Valley Line of Metrolink. Named after SR 91, the line also connects Los Angeles to Orange and Riverside counties.

A weigh station for both directions is located between the Imperial Highway and Yorba Linda Boulevard/Weir Canyon Road exits.

In 2003, Caltrans permanently closed off the Coal Canyon Road westbound and eastbound exits and entrances for environmental purposes; however, there are still traces of unmaintained road where the former exit lay, showing evidence that the ramps still exist, available to use as runaway ramps or for emergency stops. 

In 2015, Caltrans permanently closed off the Grand Boulevard eastbound exit and westbound entrance to accommodate the widening of the freeway. If the ramps had stayed open, more businesses and houses would have been demolished. The ramps were scrapped with the widening and there is no emergency exit.

The Riverside Freeway first opened in 1963 signed as U.S. Route 91 and U.S. Route 395 and the last section was built in 1975.

The 91 Express Lanes are high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) contained entirely within the median of the Riverside Freeway in Orange and Riverside counties. The 91 Express Lanes run from the junction of SR 91 with the SR 55 Freeway (Costa Mesa Freeway) in Anaheim to its junction with I-15 in Corona. Before the extension in 2017, they ended at the Riverside County line. With the extension of the toll lanes, the HOV lane between I-15 and Green River Road was converted into a HOT lane. The primary purpose of the toll lanes is to provide a faster output for drivers due to the congestion the highway experiences during peak hours, and to promote carpooling. The toll lanes opened in 1995 and when they opened, it was the country&#x27;s first fully-automated toll collection system to feature value pricing.

The 91 Express Lanes consist of two primary lanes in each direction, separated from the main lanes of the Riverside Freeway with white, , plastic lane markers (as opposed to concrete barriers or a similar solid barrier, or even just double white lines separating many other California HOT lanes). Entry and exit points for the 91 Express Lanes are only located at their west and east ends, and at the Orange–Riverside county line where the toll road originally terminated before 2017.

, the toll rates differ between the counties. In the Riverside County segment, drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. The Orange County segment instead uses a preset variable pricing system based on the time of day, with the highest toll rate set at $9.10 being charged at 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm eastbound on Fridays. Carpools with three or more people, motorcycles, and clean air vehicles are charged 50 percent of the posted toll when traveling eastbound from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm on weekdays, and travel toll-free at all other times, if they use the designated carpool lane at the toll collection points. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle is required to carry a FasTrak transponder. The 91 Express Lanes&#x27; system predates the introduction of the FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; version, with a switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants, so that or the standard FasTrak tag without the switch may be used. However, carpools with three or more people, motorcycles, and clean air vehicles must still apply for a &quot;special Access account&quot; to receive the carpool discounts. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for the carpool discounts.

==History==
===Original US 91: Barstow to Nevada===

The Arrowhead Trail, an auto trail connecting Salt Lake City with Los Angeles, initially took a longer route via present US 95 and former US 66 between Las Vegas and Needles, as the more direct Old Spanish Trail was in very poor condition. The &quot;Silver Lake cutoff&quot;, which would save about 90 miles (145 km), was proposed by 1920, and completed in 1925 as an oiled road by San Bernardino County. The Bureau of Public Roads and the state of Nevada both urged its inclusion in the state highway system, the former as part of the federal aid highway connecting Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, and the state legislature did that in 1925, with it becoming an extension of Route 31. (Across the state line, State Route 6 continued through Las Vegas to Arizona.) The initial plan for the U.S. Highway system simply stated that Route No. 91 would run from Las Vegas &quot;to an intersection with Route No. 60&quot; (which became US 66 in 1926), but in 1926 the cutoff was chosen, ending at US 66 at Daggett, just east of Barstow. (The roadway south from Las Vegas later became part of US 95.) The route was added to the federal-aid secondary system in 1926, which helped pay for a mid-1930s widening and paving, including some realignments (parts of the old road are now known as Arrowhead Trail). The new routing generally followed the present I-15, except through Baker (where it used Baker Boulevard) and into Barstow (where it followed former SR 58 to First Avenue, ending at Main Street, which carried US 66).

===SR 18: former extension of US 91 through Santa Ana Canyon to Long Beach===
US 91 was extended southwest to Long Beach in the late 1940s. Beginning at Barstow, the extension overlapped US 66 over Cajon Pass to San Bernardino. From San Bernardino west through Riverside and Santa Ana Canyon to Olive, the state took over a mostly paved county highway in 1931 as part of an extension of Route 43 to Newport Beach via Santa Ana. Two branches leading west from Route 43 near Olive along mostly constructed county roads were added in 1933: Route 175 along Orangethorpe Avenue and Artesia Boulevard from near the mouth of the canyon west to Route 60 (now SR 1) in Hermosa Beach (unconstructed through Compton until the mid-1950s), and Route 178 along Lincoln Avenue and Carson Street from Olive west to Route 168 (now SR 19) in Lakewood. When state routes were marked in 1934, Route 175 became Sign Route 14, and Sign Route 18 included all of Route 178 and most of Route 43 into the San Bernardino Mountains. When US 91 was extended to Long Beach, it overlapped SR 18 from San Bernardino to Lakewood, where it turned south along SR 19 to the Los Alamitos Traffic Circle. There it turned west along US 101 Alternate to near downtown Long Beach, where it ended at SR 15 (Atlantic Avenue), at a terminus shared with US 6. (This routing along SR 19 and US 101 Alt. also became an extension of SR 18.)

In 1935, the state improved the alignment between Fairmont Boulevard and Gypsum Canyon Road, including a bypass of the old road, which curved along the south slope of the canyon, east of Weir Canyon Road. In the late 1930s, the Prado Dam project resulted in the bypassing of a longer section, replacing Prado Road, an abandoned road curving to the east end of the dam, Pomona Rincon Road, Auto Center Drive, Pomona Road, and Yorba Street with the present Green River Road, Palisades Drive, part of SR 91, and 6th Street.

===SR 14: present SR 91 to Hermosa Beach===
Before the present freeway was constructed, SR 14 ran along Gould Avenue, Redondo Beach Boulevard, Compton Boulevard, Alameda Street, Artesia Avenue, La Habra Boulevard, Firestone Boulevard and Orangethorpe Avenue. In the 1964 renumbering, SR 14 was renumbered to SR 91.

Prior to 1991, the Gardena Freeway was known as the Redondo Beach Freeway, referring to Caltrans&#x27;s original intention for the freeway portion of the route to continue all the way to the never-built Pacific Coast Freeway.

Before 1997, Caltrans controlled maintenance of SR 91 up to State Route 1 in Hermosa Beach. The portion between Vermont Avenue and Western Avenue was relinquished to Gardena in 1997. In 2003, the western portion, from SR 1 to Western Avenue, was relinquished to the cities that the road goes through.

The first segment of the freeway was built in 1965 as US 91, and the last segment was built in 1975. Despite the relinquishments, however, Artesia Boulevard between I-110 and SR 1 is still signed off as SR 91.

===Construction of the 91 Express Lanes===
Due to rapid population growth and the decline in the availability of affordable housing closer to job centers in Orange County, new residential development began in earnest in western Riverside County from the 1980s through today. This development is occurring in or around existing cities such as Riverside, Corona, Moreno Valley, Lake Elsinore, Murrieta, and Temecula. This development also led to the incorporation of the cities of Wildomar, Menifee, Eastvale, and Jurupa Valley.

As there are very few direct routes between Orange and Riverside counties because of the Santa Ana Mountains that separate them, the Riverside Freeway is subject to high traffic volumes, composed primarily of commuters traveling between their jobs in Orange County and their homes in Riverside County (often referred to by traffic reporters as &quot;The Corona Crawl&quot;). Typical peak period delays were 30–40 minutes in each direction in the ten miles (16 km) of the tollway before construction.

Solutions to the traffic problem were limited. The chosen solution was to create a toll road in the median of the freeway. This original section of the 91 Express Lanes operated between the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55) interchange in eastern Anaheim and the Orange–Riverside county line, a distance of about . The project was developed in partnership with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) by California Private Transportation Company (CPTC), which formally transferred ownership of the facility to the State of California prior to opening the project to traffic on December 27, 1995. Caltrans then leased the toll road back to CPTC for a 35-year operating period. The new lanes have been officially designated a part of the state highway system. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) is responsible for providing police services at CPTC&#x27;s expense. Maintenance and operational costs for the facility are also the responsibility of CPTC.

In April 2002, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) reached an agreement in concept to purchase the private toll road project for $207.5 million. The OCTA took possession of the toll road on January 3, 2003, marking the first time the 91 Express Lanes was managed by public officials. Within a few months, OCTA turned the lanes into the HOT / tollway hybrid that it is today. One of the primary investors in CPTC, Cofiroute USA, continues to manage and operate the lanes under a management contract with OCTA.

Opening in 1995, the 91 Express Lanes was the first privately funded tollway built in the United States since the 1940s, and the first fully automated tollway in the world.

The express lanes have been controversial because of a non-compete agreement that the state made with CPTC. The clause, which was negotiated by Caltrans and never was brought to the legislature, prevented any improvements along of the Riverside Freeway to ensure profit for the express lanes. This includes restricting the state from widening the free lanes or building mass transit near the freeway. CPTC filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over freeway widening related to the interchange with the Eastern Transportation Corridor, which was dismissed once the purchase with OCTA was finalized. Following the settlement, an additional lane was added for a segment eastbound from SR 241 to SR 71.

However, as a result of the controversy, more toll road advocates favor creating local agencies similar to transportation corridor agencies to build and maintain future tollways. New toll roads would be financed with tax-exempt bonds on a stand-alone basis, meaning that taxpayers would not be responsible for repaying any debt if toll revenues fall short. Also, there would be a less restrictive non-compete clause: they would be compensated only for any revenue loss caused by improvements near the toll roads.

In the mid-2010s, the Riverside County Transportation Commission extended the 91 Express Lanes east from their previous terminus at the Orange–Riverside county line to the I-15 interchange in Corona; this extension opened to traffic on March 20, 2017. Both Orange and Riverside County transportation agencies co-manage the 91 Express Lanes.

==Future==
In 2005, evaluations were made about the feasibility of constructing two tunnels through the Santa Ana Mountains which could carry 72,000 cars per day and allow for a commuter rail service between Corona and Irvine. The financial and technical evaluations found that in the current financial environment, building the tunnels would not be financially or technologically feasible. Additional study of the Irvine Corona Expressway tunnel project has been deferred until such time as financial considerations improve and/or technological advancements warrant reexamination. If built, the Irvine-Corona Expressway would follow a similar route to the 91 Freeway and is designed to reduce the growing traffic congestion on SR 91 that prompted the construction of the 91 Express Lanes. If completed, the Irvine-Corona Expressway is projected to be the longest traffic tunnel in North America, approximately . One tunnel would be a reversible two-lane freeway for autos and trucks, the direction reversed based on time of day. It would carry westbound traffic in the morning hours, and eastbound traffic during the afternoon and early evening hours. The second tunnel would be slated exclusively for light rail commuter train service. The proposed tunnels are opposed by environmental groups, cities in Orange County near the terminus of the proposed road, and by the Irvine Company, which believes that the tunnel is not necessary and distracts from short-term solutions such as freeway widening.

Numerous other projects by the Orange County Transportation Authority are currently underway or in the planning phases for distant completion, some as far out as the year 2030.

<text>Khorog ( ), also Khorugh ( ) or Kharagh ( ), is the capital of Gorno-Badakhshan, Tajikistan. It is also the capital of the Shughnon District of Gorno-Badakhshan. It has a population of 30,500 (2020 ).

Khorog is above sea level in the Pamir Mountains (ancient Mount Imeon) at the confluence of the rivers Ghunt and Panj. The city is bounded to the south (Nivodak) and to the north (Tem) by the deltas of the Shakhdara and Ghunt, respectively. The two rivers merge in the eastern part of the city flow through the city, dividing it almost evenly until its delta in the Panj, on the border with Afghanistan. Khorog is known for its poplar trees that dominate the flora of the city.

==History==
Until the late 19th century, Khorog was in an area disputed between the Emir of Bukhara, Shah of Afghanistan, Russia and Britain. The Russians emerged the winners of the region after The Great Game, which fixed the current northern border of Afghanistan on the Panj River and established the territory of Russian Pamir around Khorog.

Before 1896, when the Russians arrived and built a fort, the main town in the area was Kala-i Bar Panj (or Bar Panja Qal&#x27;a) somewhat downriver on the Afghan side. Following the fall of czarist Russia and the rise of the Soviet Union, Khorog became the capital of Gorno-Badakhshan in 1925. Soviet leaders encouraged the migration of settlers to the area with promises of pay, medals and automobiles, but with no industry and little arable land, the effort was not successful.

Khorog occupied headlines in July 2012 due to a government forces clash with guerrillas. Over 40 people, including 12 soldiers were killed (many reports indicated that the number of casualties could be higher). The country’s security forces moved in to arrest suspects in the murder of secret services General Abdullo Nazarov. The alleged criminals were linked to former guerrilla leader-turned-border patrol commander Tolib Ayombekov. Ayombekov is alleged to have been involved in drug trafficking and the smuggling of tobacco and precious stones for many years. In 2014, 2018, 2021 and most recently in May 2022, Khorog was the scene of violent clashes and demonstrations against suspected human rights violations by security forces.

Pamir&#x27;s botanical garden is the most popular view of Khorog. It was established in 1940 to test the survival rate of various plants in mountain climate conditions. More than 30,000 varieties of plants have been checked according to official statistics, which now covers around 4,000 types of garden collection. Located close to Khorog, the botanic garden of Pamir opens up a great panoramic view of the entire city.

==Facilities and education==
Modern Khorog is one of the poorest areas of Tajikistan, with the non-profit Aga Khan Foundation providing almost the only source of cash income. However, the city does have its own university (Khorog State University, founded in 1992), twelve schools, and several hospitals. There is a museum, the Khorog Regional Museum, an Ismaili Centre, and the second-highest botanical garden in the world, the Pamir Botanical Garden.
Khorog is also host to the Aga Khan Lycee and one of the three campuses of the University of Central Asia. The university was founded in 2000 by the governments of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and The Aga Khan. It is the world’s first internationally chartered institution of higher education. UCA has three Schools – School of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Development and the School of Professional and Continuing Education. The Khorog campus offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in Global Economics and Earth and Environmental Sciences.

==Transportation==
There is a bridge to the Afghan side of the river. Khorog is situated along the Pamir Highway at the point where it leaves the Panj valley and heads east up the Ghunt valley. The Pamir highway is the main road in Gorno-Badakhshan and connects the Tajik capital of Dushanbe toward the west to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the northeast.

The highway is very difficult to pass in both directions, especially during winter and spring. Khorog also has a small airport, which can accommodate smaller airplanes like AN-28 turboprop and the Yakovlev YAK-40, or helicopters. Currently, in 2023, there are no regular flights between Khorog and Dushanbe.

==Climate==
Khorog experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers.
== Notable people ==
The following is a list of well-known people who were born or brought up in Khorog:

* Oleg Fesov, prominent Pamiri musical artist
* Ulfatmo Mamadambarova, singer and musician and Honoured Artist of Tajikistan
* Muhammadboqir Muhammadboqirov, Tajik opposition politician killed in clashes with government forces in 2022
* Shodi Shabdolov, chairman of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 1991 to 2016

==Sports==
Khorog is the locality of highest altitude where bandy has been played.

<text>Kulob or Khatlon is a city in Khatlon Region in southern Tajikistan. Located southeast of the capital Dushanbe on the river Yakhsu (a right tributary of Panj), it is one of the largest cities in the country. Its population is estimated at 106,300 for the city proper and 214,700 for the city with the outlying communities (2020). The city is served by Kulob Airport.

== History ==
===Greek inscription===
During the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great, the region of modern Kulob was part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. A Greek inscription dating to the period 200195BC has been discovered in which a person named Heliodotos dedicates a fire altar to Hestia for the sake of the king Euthydemus I and his son Demetrius I.

===Later history===

The historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari refers to Khatlon as early as AD 737, although its founding is said to have been much earlier. The Sufi mystic Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani died while travelling through Central Asia in 1384 and was buried in Khatlon in a tomb which still stands.
The city was conquered by the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan and subsequently formed part of the Timurid Empire. It was incorporated into the Khanate of Bukhara in 1559 and subsequently usually aligned with the Emirate of Bukhara against Kokand and Afghanistan after the 18th century. Its name was changed to Kulob in 1750. The local lord Surrah Khan imprisoned the British and Kokand agent Abdul Mejid on behalf of Bukhara in 1861 before the disorder in the emirate prompted him to release the party. 

Following agreements between the British and Russian Empires over the disposition of Afghanistan, the city and its hinterland were incorporated into the Russian Empire as part of its conquest of most of Central Asia. After the Russian Revolution, Kulob was only incorporated into the Soviet Union in March 1921 and was organized as part of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. Kulob was one of the largest cities in the republic.

During the Tajikistani Civil War in the early 1990s, the city served as the main base of the Popular Front militias. Danghara, a village in the Kulob area, is the birthplace of Tajikistan&#x27;s president Emomali Rahmon. In September 2006, Kulob celebrated its 2700th anniversary.

After Tajikistan&#x27;s independence in 1991, Kulob was one of the three citiesalongside Dushanbe and Qurghonteppawhere the Russian 201st Motor Rifle Division was deployed. Following a number of scandals with local residents, Russia unexpectedly pulled its troops from Kulob in November 2015, effectively abandoning the base there.

<text>Bokhtar (), previously known as Qurghonteppa, Kurganteppa and Kurgan-Tyube, is a city in southwestern Tajikistan, which serves as the capital of the Khatlon region. Bokhtar is the largest city in southern Tajikistan, and is located south of Dushanbe and north of Kunduz, Afghanistan.

== Population ==
As of 2019, the city&#x27;s population was estimated at 110,800, making it the third-largest city in the country. The population fluctuates depending on the season, due to the many Tajik migrant workers in Russia.

Along with the capital Dushanbe, Bokhtar is more demographically diverse than other major Tajik cities such as Khujand, Kulob or Istaravshan. Its population includes Tajiks, Uzbeks, Russians, Pashtuns, Tatars, Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Greeks, and many more. The city had a large number of ethnic Russians who worked in the industrial and agricultural complexes in and around the city.

Bokhtar is a stronghold of Tajikistan&#x27;s political opposition.

== Overview ==
During the civil war in Tajikistan, Bokhtar (then Qurghonteppa) became the epicenter of conflict by the summer of 1992, and was seriously damaged. Many of the local Kulobi and Uzbeks were forced to flee in 1992, following attacks by the pro-opposition Gharmi forces.

The city was officially renamed from Qurghonteppa to Bokhtar on 22 January 2018. The name change was one of many in Tajikistan targeting places whose names derive from the Uzbek and Kyrgyz languages.

Near Bokhtar are the ruins of a Buddhist monastery complex called Ajina Tepe, believed to be built in the 7th or 8th centuries CE. It features a 12-meter-long image of Buddha in Nirvana.

Bokhtar International Airport provides flights to a handful of cities in Tajikistan, Russia and Kazakhstan.

== Climate ==
Bokhtar has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;), with cool winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is quite low. It is highest in the spring, while summers are very dry.

== Notable people ==
*Sergei Mandreko (1971-2022) - football coach
*Nurudin N. Mukhitdinov (1959-) - politician

== Trivia ==
Finnish electronic duo Pan Sonic have a track entitled &quot;Radio Qurghonteppa&quot; on their 2010 farewell album Gravitoni.

<doc id="439887" wikidata="Q1043568" url="?curid=439887" title="Prime Minister of Vietnam">
<text>The Prime Minister of Vietnam () is the head of government of Vietnam who presides over the meetings of the Government (formerly the Council of Ministers). The prime minister directs the work of government members, and may propose deputy prime ministers to the National Assembly.

The head of government is responsible to the National Assembly and serves as the deputy chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. Moreover, prime minister is also the chairman of the Council for National Education, Standing Member of the Central Military Commission and the Central Police Party Committee. The tenure of a prime minister is five years, and the term is renewable once. The current prime minister Phạm Minh Chính has served since 2021. In case of incapacity, a deputy prime minister assumes the office of acting prime minister until the prime minister resumes duty, or until the appointment of a new prime minister.

The powers and prestige of the prime minister have varied through the years. Phạm Văn Đồng, unified Vietnam&#x27;s first prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. Since the death of Phạm Hùng in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked third in the order of precedence of the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.

==History==

Ho Chi Minh, who also served as the country&#x27;s president, was appointed Vietnam&#x27;s first prime minister in 1946 by the National Assembly, after having served months as the acting chairman of the Provisional Government and foreign minister in the aftermath of the 1945 August Revolution. Both the 1946 and 1959 constitutions state that the National Assembly had the power to appoint and relieve the prime minister of his duties. The prime minister presided over the Council of Ministers, the highest executive body of state, from 1981 until it was renamed to Government in the 1992 constitution. The office of prime minister was renamed in the 1980 constitution to that of Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

Phạm Văn Đồng, served as North Vietnamese prime minister from 1955 until 1976, when he became prime minister of a unified Vietnam, and then until 1987, when he resigned. At his resignation, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Vietnamese history, and the oldest serving prime minister in the world. He often lamented that he was one of the world&#x27;s weakest prime ministers, on one occasion saying; &quot;I can do nothing. When I say something, nobody listens. If I propose changing a deputy minister, it turns out to be impossible. I cannot even choose my own ministers.&quot; Since the death of Phạm Hùng in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked third in the order of precedence of the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo.

==Duties, powers and responsibilities==

The National Assembly by a proposal of the president of Vietnam elects the prime minister. The prime minister is responsible to the National Assembly, and the Assembly elects all ministers to government. Activity reports by the prime minister must be given to the National Assembly, while the Standing Committee of the National Assembly supervises the activities of the Central Government and the prime minister. Finally, the deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the prime minister and other members of government.

The prime minister is the only member of government who must be a member of the National Assembly. This is because the prime minister is accountable to the National Assembly, and he reports to it, or to its Standing Committee, and to the president. The prime minister issues directives and supervises the implementation of formal orders given by the president, the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. Cabinet members and members of the Central Government in general are responsible to the prime minister and the National Assembly for the fields they specialise in. According to the Constitution of Vietnam, the following are the duties, powers and responsibilities of the prime minister:
* To head the Central Government, and direct the works of members of the Central Government, the People&#x27;s Councils at all levels and to chair the meetings of the Cabinet;
* To propose to the National Assembly that ministries, or organs with ministerial rank, be established or dissolved; to present to the National Assembly or, when the latter is not in session, to its Standing Committee, for approval, proposals on the appointment, release from duty, or dismissal of deputy prime ministers, cabinet ministers and other members of the Government;
* To appoint, release from duty, or dismiss deputy ministers and officials of equal rank; to approve the election, release from duty, secondment and dismissal of chairmen and deputy chairmen of People&#x27;s Committees of provinces and cities under direct central rule;
* To suspend or annul decisions, directives and circulars of cabinet ministers and other Government members, decisions and directives of People&#x27;s Councils and chairmen of People&#x27;s Committees of provinces and cities under direct central rule that contravene the Constitution, the law, or other formal written documents of superior State organs;
* To suspend the execution of resolutions of People&#x27;s Councils of provinces and cities under direct central rule that contravene the Constitution, the law, or the formal written orders of superior State organs; at the same time to propose to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly to annul them;
* To make regular reports to the people through the mass media on major issues to be settled by the Government.
* When the prime minister is absent, he must choose one of his deputy prime ministers to direct the work of the government.

The prime minister serves concurrently as the secretary of the CPV Government Caucus Commission. The National Assembly chairman serves as the commission&#x27;s deputy. Currently there are ten members of the commission, all of whom hold government posts. Commission members are appointed by the Politburo, and the commission itself is responsible to the Politburo and the Secretariat. The decision-making process within the commission is based on the principles of collective leadership.

<text>Merton Park is an area within the district of Morden in the London Borough of Merton. Bordering areas are Colliers Wood, Morden, South Wimbledon and Raynes Park. It is southwest of Charing Cross. It lies east of Kingston upon Thames, west of Mitcham and north of Sutton. 

Farmland in the area was bought by John Innes in 1864 and developed in the following decades. Innes provided in his will for his home, the Manor House, to become what is now the John Innes Centre which remains a leading centre for plant genetics albeit now in Norwich. While in Merton it created new plant varieties such as the ‘Merton Thornless’ blackberry and the Malling-Merton (MM) series of apple rootstocks, as well as John Innes composts.

==History==
Until the last quarter of the 19th century, the parish of Merton was mainly rural. The area now known as Merton Park was farmland bought by City wine merchant John Innes in 1864 following the rapid development of Wimbledon to the north. He took as his model the garden suburbs (particularly Bedford Park in Chiswick) and between 1870 and 1904 developed the tree-lined roads of detached and semi-detached houses for which the area is known. 

Innes bought Manor Farm for his own home, and in the 1890s had it rebuilt as the Manor House by architect Henry Goodall Quartermain. Around 1872, Innes became Lord of the Manor of Merton. After his death in 1904 he left most of the grounds of the Manor House to be converted into a public park, with the rest becoming the John Innes Horticultural Institution . The first director was William Bateson, who had coined the word &quot;genetics&quot; and would found The Genetics Society in 1919. The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane worked part-time at the Institution from 1927 to 1937. When Sir Alfred Daniel Hall became director after Bateson&#x27;s death in 1926, one of his earliest tasks was to appoint as assistant director &quot;a man of high quality in the study of genetics&quot; as Hall lacked a background in genetics. Upon the recommendation of Julian Huxley, the council appointed Haldane in March 1927, with the terms: &quot;Mr. Haldane to visit the Institution fortnightly for a day and a night during the Cambridge terms, to put in two months also at Easter and long vacations in two continuous blocks and to be free in the Christmas vacation.&quot; He was officer in charge of Genetical Investigations. Haldane was credited with helping the John Innes become &quot;the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain&quot;.

The genetics research of Dorothea De Winton and Haldane required the reliable cultivation of large numbers of primulas; after large losses in the 1933-34 season William Lawrence and John Newell formulated composts that would give consistently good and reliable results. In 1938 they published their recipes for what became known as John Innes composts. New fruit varieties released by the Institution included the blackberries ‘Merton Early’ (1936) and ‘Merton Thornless’ (1941), and the Malling-Merton (MM) series of apple rootstocks. The Institution moved to Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire, in 1950 and subsequently to Norwich, where it is now known as the John Innes Centre.

==Government==
A notable feature of the Merton Park ward is that it regularly returns Merton Park Ward Independent Residents to Merton London Borough Council. Five MPWRA have also been Deputy Mayor of Merton: Peter Southgate in 2005/06, Krysia Williams in 2008/09, Karin Forbes in 2009/10, John Sargeant in 2013/14 and Edward Foley 2019/20.

The John Innes Society is a charity that promotes good design and area embellishment in Merton Park.

==Geography==
The approximate boundaries of the Merton Park area can be considered to be The Broadway (A219) to the north, Morden Road (A24) to the east, Martin Way to the south and Cannon Hill Lane to the west. Additionally, the area north of Kingston Road between Merton Hall Road, Avebury Road and Kingswood Road is often included. This definition of the area does not correspond directly with the Local Government ward of the same name which for administrative convenience includes areas as far south as Morden South railway station.

The area contains two state schools: Merton Park Primary and Rutlish School (boys) and is almost entirely residential in character without shops or pubs except a bar at the Old Rutlishians (&#x27;Old Ruts&#x27;) playing field and clubhouse in Poplar Road.

Residential roads in Merton Park include:
Dorset Road (B285),
Hartfield Road (B285),
Mostyn Road (B2850),
Kenley Road,
Windermere Avenue,
Sandbourne Avenue,
Gladstone Road,
Russell Road,
Pelham Road,
Merton Road (A219),
The Broadway (A219),
Poplar Road,
Cannon Hill Lane (In SW20),
Aylward Road (In SW20).
Several of these are named after former Prime Ministers.

==Transport==
Merton Park is relatively rich in public transport, being served by National Rail, London Underground, and London Trams. 

The area is served by Wimbledon railway station with access to the District Line, South Western Railway, Thameslink and Southern Services, Wimbledon Chase Railway Station, (located just outside the area), and South Merton Railway Station, both providing a 2 t.p.h. Thameslink service towards Central London or Sutton. Wimbledon station provides access to London Waterloo and the District line.

Morden tube station provides access to the Northern Line.

The London Trams also serve the area from Merton Park tram stop. The tram stop occupies part of the former Merton Park railway station, which closed in 1997.

==Landmarks==
The area is centred on the historic parish church, St Mary&#x27;s. The church was founded in the 12th century by the Augustinian order of the nearby Merton Priory of which only the Western Gate remains. John Innes is buried in the churchyard.

The northern section of Merton Park each side of Kingston Road (A238) and Below Dorset Road to the B286 are now conservation areas. 

Parks in the area include:

* John Innes Park &amp; Recreation Ground
* Mostyn Gardens
* Kendor Gardens
* Church Lane Playing Fields
* St Mary&#x27;s Glebe

==Notable people==
* John Innes, property developer and philanthropist
* William Bateson, geneticist and first director of the horticultural institution 
* Sir Alfred Daniel Hall, agricultural educator
* J. B. S. Haldane, geneticist
* Dorothea De Winton, geneticist
* John Dimmer, recipient of the Victoria Cross in 1914, lived here.
* Folk singer Sandy Denny was born in the Nelson Hospital.
* Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones lived on Mostyn Road after they moved back to the UK from America in 1986. They left the area in 1991.

<text>Dr Thomas Wright FRS FRSE FGS (9 November 180917 November 1884) was a Scottish surgeon and palaeontologist.

Wright published a number of papers on the fossils which he had collected in the Cotswolds and elsewhere, including &quot;Lias Ammonites of the British Isles&quot;, and monographs on the British fossil echinoderms of the Oolitic (Jurassic) and Cretaceous formations.

==Life==
Wright was born in Paisley on 9 November 1809, the son of Thomas Wright and his wife, Barbara Jarvis, and was educated at Paisley Grammar School.
He studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland based in Dublin. He returned to Scotland to practice and received his doctorate (MD) from St Andrews University in 1846.
In 1846 he moved to Cheltenham, where he became medical officer of health to the urban district, and surgeon at Cheltenham General Hospital.

In his leisure time, he took up geological pursuits, became a member of the Cotteswold Naturalists&#x27; Club, and made a collection of Jurassic fossils.
In 1855 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Sir William Jardine. In 1859 he was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in London. He won the Wollaston Medal in 1878 and became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1879.

In the early 1880s, he served as president of the Midland Union of Natural History Societies.

After his death, part of his fossil collection was sold to the British Museum.

==Family==
He married twice: firstly around 1830 to Elizabeth May; secondly in 1845 to Mary Ricketts (died 1878), youngest daughter of Sir Robert Tristram Ricketts.

He had one son, Thomas Lawrence Wright, and two daughters, the elder of which married the geologist Edward Wethered.

<text>Mayhaw is the name given to the fruit of the species of Crataegus&quot; series &quot;Aestivales that are common in wetlands throughout the southern United States. The principal species are &quot;C. aestivalis&quot;, the eastern mayhaw, and &quot;C. opaca&quot;, the western mayhaw.

Mayhaws grow in moist soil in river and creek bottoms under hardwood trees. The fruit is also found in bayous surrounding lakes, such as Caddo Lake on the Texas/Louisiana border. The fruit ripens in late April through May, thus the name may-haw. Mayhaws are often collected out of the water from boats, and the fruit is used to make jelly.

Families would go on outings to collect mayhaws and create stockpiles of the jelly to last throughout the year, but the tradition has declined with the increasing urbanization of the South and the destruction of the mayhaw&#x27;s native habitat. The fruit has also been cultivated to grow outside of wetlands, and this is increasingly the source of the jelly.

== In culture ==
Many communities associate themselves with the fruit because of its reputation as a celebrated delicacy of Southern U.S. cuisine. For example, Colquitt, Georgia, holds a mayhaw festival in April. Daisetta, Texas; El Dorado, Arkansas; Marion, Louisiana; and Starks, Louisiana, all celebrate a mayhaw festival each May.

The mayhaw is the state fruit tree of Louisiana.

<text>Farrer Herschell, 1st Baron Herschell, (2 November 1837 – 1 March 1899), was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in 1886, and again from 1892 to 1895.

==Life==

===Childhood and education===
Herschell was born on 2 November 1837 in Brampton, Hampshire. His parents were Helen Skirving Mowbray and the Rev. Ridley Haim Herschell, who was a native of Strzelno, in Prussian Poland. When Ridley was a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity and took a leading part in founding the British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Among the Jews. He eventually settled down to the charge of a Nonconformist chapel near the Edgware Road, in London, where he ministered to a large congregation.

Farrer was educated at a grammar school in South London and attended lectures at the University of Bonn as a teenager, where his family lived for six months in 1852. In 1857 he took his BA degree with honours in Greek and mathematics at University College London, receiving prizes in logic and political economy. He was regarded as the best speaker at the University College London Union Debating Society and was editor of a &quot;University Review&quot; along with R.D. Littler. He later served as an examiner in common law for the University of London from 1872 to 1876.

=== Early career ===
Herschell&#x27;s reputation persisted after he became a law student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. On 12 January 1858 he entered the chambers of Thomas Chitty, the famous special pleader. His fellow pupils included Archibald Levin Smith, subsequently Master of the Rolls, and Arthur Charles who became a judge of the Queen&#x27;s Bench. He subsequently read with James Hannen, who went on to become Lord Hannen. His fellow pupils gave him the &quot;sobriquet&quot; &quot;Chief Baron&quot; because of his air of superiority. On 17 November 1860 he was called to the bar and joined the Northern Circuit.

For four or five years he did not obtain much work, although he was financially secure. He spoke to Charles Russell and William Court Gully about the possibility of leaving England and instead working for the British Consular Courts in China. However, Herschell soon made himself useful to Edward James, the then leader of the Northern Circuit, and to John Richard Quain, the leading stuffgownsman. For the latter he noted briefs and drafted legal opinions. When, in 1866, Quain took silk, Herschell inherited much of his junior practice. In 1872, Herschell took silk and the following year, he became Recorder of Carlisle.

===Member of Parliament===
By 1874, his business had become so good that he turned his thoughts to politics and election to Parliament. In February of that year there was a general election, with the result that the Conservative Party came into power with a parliamentary majority of fifty. The two Radicals, Thomas Charles Thompson and John Henderson who had been returned for City of Durham were unseated, and an attack was then made on the seats of two other Radicals, Isaac Lowthian Bell and Charles Mark Palmer who had been returned for North Durham. Herschell was briefed for one of the latter. He made such an impression on the local Radical leaders that they asked him to stand for City of Durham. After two weeks&#x27; electioneering, he was elected as junior member.

Between 1874 and 1880, Herschell was assiduous in his attendance of the House of Commons. He was not a frequent speaker, but his few efforts garnered him a favourable reputation as a debater. On one occasion, he carried a resolution in favour of abolishing actions for breach of promise of marriage except when actual pecuniary loss had ensued, the damages in such cases to be measured by the amount of such loss. He also prominently opposed the Fugitive Slave Circular. In 1878, he also pointed out the unconstitutionality of Lord Hartington&#x27;s proposal to censure the government for bringing Indian troops to Malta. He was noticed by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, who in 1880 appointed Herschell Solicitor General.

===Solicitor General===
Herschell was knighted on 13 May 1880, within weeks of his appointment as Solicitor General, a position he was to hold until 1885. During this time, he turned down positions as a Lord of Appeal and Master of the Rolls. As Solicitor General, he drafted multiple bills, most notably the Irish Land Act 1881, the Corrupt Practices Act 1883, the Bankruptcy Act 1883, the County Franchise Act 1884. He also assisted Sir Mackenzie Chalmers with the drafting of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882.

He also drafted the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 which halved the representation of Durham City, thus requiring him to quit his seat. Betting on the local support of the Cavendish family, he contested the North Lonsdale division of Lancashire, but in spite of the powerful influence of Lord Hartington, he was badly beaten at the poll. Gladstone, however, again obtained a majority in Parliament. Herschell felt the Solicitor General&#x27;s post slipping away from him, and along with it all prospects of promotion. Lord Selborne and Sir Henry James, however, successively declined Gladstone&#x27;s offer of the Woolsack, and Herschell suddenly found himself Lord Chancellor.

===Lord Chancellor===

On 6 February 1886, he became Lord Chancellor and was sworn of the Privy Council. He was also elevated to the peerage as Baron Herschell of the city of Durham. However, his first chancellorship lasted barely four months, because in June 1886 Gladstone&#x27;s Home Rule Bill was rejected in the Commons and his ministry fell.

In August 1892, when Gladstone returned to power, Herschell again became Lord Chancellor. In May 1893, he was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Knight Grand Cross (GCB). In September 1893, when the second Home Rule BiIl came on for second reading in the House of Lords, Herschell took advantage of the opportunity to justify his own 1885 sudden conversion to Home Rule, and that of his colleagues, by comparing it to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s conversion to Catholic emancipation in 1829 and to that of Sir Robert Peel to Free Trade in 1846. In 1895, however, his second chancellorship came to an end with the defeat of the Rosebery ministry.

He was perhaps seen at his judicial best in &quot;Vagliano v. Bank of England&quot; (1891) and &quot;Allen v. Flood&quot; (1898). Latterly he showed a tendency to interrupt counsel overmuch. The latter case is an example of this. The question involved was what constituted a &quot;molestation of a man in the pursuit of his lawful calling&quot;. At the close of the argument of counsel, whom he had frequently interrupted, one of their lordships observed that although there might be a doubt as to what amounted to such molestation in point of law, the House could well understand, after that day&#x27;s proceedings, what it was in actual practice.

===Other public service===
In addition to his political and judicial work, Herschell rendered many public services. He became a deputy lieutenant of the County Palatine of Durham in 1885 and of the County of Kent in 1890. In 1888 he presided over an inquiry directed by the House of Commons, with regard to the Metropolitan Board of Works. He acted as chairman of two royal commissions, one on Indian currency, the other on vaccination. In 1890, he was appointed Captain of Deal Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. He took a great interest in the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, not only promoting the acts of 1889 and 1894, but also in sifting the truth of allegations which had been brought against the management of that society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1892.

In June 1893 he was appointed chancellor of the University of London succeeding the Earl of Derby. His views of reform, according to Victor Dickins, the accomplished registrar of the university, were liberal and frankly stated, though at first they were not altogether popular. He disarmed opposition by his intellectual power, rather than conciliated it by compromise, and sometimes was perhaps a little forceful in his approach various matters of controversy.

His characteristic power of detachment was well illustrated by his treatment of the proposal to remove the university to the site of the Imperial Institute at South Kensington. Although he was then chairman of the institute, the most irreconcilable opponent of the removal never questioned his absolute impartiality. Herschell had been officially connected with the Imperial Institute from its inception. He was chairman of the provisional committee appointed by Edward Prince of Wales to formulate a scheme for its organisation, and he took an active part in the preparation of its royal charter and constitution in conjunction with Lord Thring, Lord James, Sir Frederick Abel and Sir John Hollams. He was the first chairman of its council, and, except during his tour in India in 1888, when he brought the institute to the notice of the Indian authorities, he was hardly absent from a single meeting. For his special services in this connection he received the Order of the Bath in 1893, this being the only instance of a Lord Chancellor being decorated with an order. In 1893 he became, at its foundation, president of the Society of Comparative Legislation.

In 1897 he was appointed, jointly with Lord Justice Collins, to represent Great Britain on the Venezuela Boundary Commission, which met in Paris in the spring of 1899. Such a complicated business involved a careful study of maps and historic documents. Not content with this, he accepted in 1898 a seat on the Anglo-American Arbitration Commission appointed to adjudicate in the Alaska boundary dispute and to adjust boundaries and other important questions pending between Great Britain and Canada on the one hand and the United States on the other hand. He started for the US in July of that year, and was received cordially at Washington D.C.. His fellow commissioners elected him their president.

===Death===
In February 1899, while the commission was in full swing, Herchell slipped in the street and fractured his pelvis. His constitution, which at one time was a robust one, had been undermined by constant hard work, and proved unequal to sustaining the shock. On 1 March, only two weeks after the accident, he died at the Shoreham Hotel, Washington, a post-mortem examination revealing heart disease. John Hay, United States Secretary of State, at once telegraphed to Joseph Hodges Choate, the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, the deep sorrow felt by President William McKinley. The prime minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, said the next day in the Canadian House of Commons that he regarded Herschell&#x27;s death as a misfortune to Canada and to the British Empire.

A funeral service held in St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Washington, was attended by the president and vice-president of the United States, by the cabinet ministers, the judges of the Supreme Court, the members of the joint high commission, and a large number of senators and other representative men. The body was brought to London in a British man-of-war, HMS Talbot and a second funeral service was held in Westminster Abbey, which was attended by Lord Halsbury, Lord Kimberley, Arthur Balfour and other representatives of the British, American, and Canadian governments. He was buried on 22 March 1899 at Tincleton, Dorset, in the parish church where he had been married.

==Personal life==
Herschell left a widow whom he had married in 1876, Agnes Adela, daughter of Edward Leigh Kindersley and granddaughter of Vice-Chancellor Richard Torin Kindersley. Lady Herschell died at Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques on 23 February 1902. They left a son, Richard Herschell (1878–1929), who succeeded as second baron, and three daughters: Helen Mowbray Herschell, Muriel Fanny Herschell, and Agnes Freda Forres.

He was a member of a number of social clubs, including Brooks&#x27;s, the Athenaenum Club, the Windham Club, the Devonshire Club, and the National Liberal Club. He also received honorary degrees from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge.

<doc id="439896" wikidata="Q13426137" url="?curid=439896" title="Joseph Hodges Choate">
<text>Joseph Hodges Choate (January 24, 1832 – May 14, 1917) was an American lawyer and diplomat. He was chairman of the American delegation at the Second Hague Conference, and ambassador to the United Kingdom.

Choate was associated with many of the most famous litigations in American legal history, including the Kansas prohibition cases, the Chinese exclusion cases, the Isaac H. Maynard election returns case, the Income Tax Suit, and the Samuel J. Tilden, Jane Stanford, and Alexander Turney Stewart will cases. In the public sphere, he was influential in the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

==Early life==
Choate was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on January 24, 1832. He was the son of Margaret Manning (&quot;née&quot; Hodges) Choate and physician George Choate. Among his siblings were William Gardner Choate, a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Dr. George Cheyne Shattuck Choate, and a sister, Caroline Choate (von Gersdorff).

His father&#x27;s first cousin (his first cousin once removed) was Rufus Choate, a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. His paternal grandparents were George Choate and Susanna Choate, and his maternal grandparents were Gamaliel Hodges and Sarah (née Williams) Hodges.

Choate graduated from Harvard College in 1852 and Harvard Law School in 1854.

==Career==


After graduation from law school, Choate was admitted first to the Massachusetts in 1855, followed by admission to the New York bar in 1856, after which he entered the law office of Scudder &amp; Carter in New York City.

His success in his profession was immediate, and in 1860 he became junior partner in the firm of Evarts, Southmayd &amp; Choate, the senior partner in which was William M. Evarts. This firm and its successor, that of Evarts, Choate &amp; Beaman, remained for many years among the leading law firms of New York and of the country, the activities of both being national rather than local.

During these busy years, Choate was associated with many of the most famous legal cases in American legal history, including the Tilden, Alexander Turney Stewart, and Jane Stanford will cases, the Kansas prohibition cases, the Chinese exclusion cases (in which he argued against the law&#x27;s validity), the Isaac H. Maynard election returns case, and the Income Tax Suit. In 1871, he became a member of the Committee of Seventy in New York City, which was instrumental in breaking up the Tweed Ring, and later assisted in the prosecution of the indicted officials. He served as president of the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, and the New York City Bar Association. In the retrial of the General Fitz-John Porter case, he obtained a reversal of the decision of the original court-martial.

His greatest reputation was won perhaps in cross-examination. In politics, he allied himself with the Republican Party on its organization, being a frequent speaker in presidential campaigns, beginning with that of 1856. He never held political office, although he was a candidate for the Republican U.S. senatorial nomination for New York against Senator Thomas C. Platt in 1897. During this time he was a &quot;true believer&quot; in the cause of Cuban independence, being heavily informed and swayed by Cuban exiles in New York City, including Tomás Estrada Palma. In 1894, he was president of the New York state constitutional convention.

===U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom===
He was appointed, by President McKinley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom to succeed John Hay in 1899, and remained in this position after Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s ascendancy to the presidency until the spring of 1905. In England, he won great personal popularity, and accomplished much in fostering the good relations of the two great English-speaking powers. He represented the president at the funeral of Queen Victoria. He was one of the representatives of the United States at the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907.

===Later life===
Upon the outbreak of the World War I, he ardently supported the cause of the Allies. He severely criticized President Wilson&#x27;s hesitation to recommend America&#x27;s immediate cooperation, but shortly before his death retracted his criticism. He was chairman of the mayor&#x27;s committee in New York for entertaining the British and French commissions in 1917. His death was hastened by the physical strain of his constant activities in this connection.

==Personal life==

On October 16, 1861, he married Caroline Dutcher Sterling Choate (1837–1929), who had been born in Salisbury, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Caroline Mary (née Dutcher) Sterling and Frederick Augustine Sterling and a distant relative of Frederick A. Sterling. Caroline was an artist and an advocate for women&#x27;s education, helping to establish both Brearley School and Barnard College.

Joseph and Caroline were the parents of five children, two of whom predeceased their parents:

* Ruluff Sterling Choate (September 24, 1864 – April 5, 1884)
* George Choate (born January 28, 1867 – 1937)
* Josephine Choate (January 9, 1869 – July 20, 1896)
* Mabel Choate (December 26, 1870 – 1958), who did not marry and became a gardener and philanthropist.
* Joseph Hodges Choate Jr. (February 2, 1876 – 1968), who married Cora Lyman Oliver, daughter of General Robert Shaw Oliver, in 1903.

The family owned a large country house, known as Naumkeag, which was designed by Stanford White and is today open to the public as a nonprofit museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

Choate died on May 14, 1917, at his residence, 8 East 63rd Street in Manhattan. 
His funeral was held on May 17 at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in New York, where it was attended by the British Ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the French Minister of Education, M. Hovelacque, and the Assistant Secretary of State, William Phillips, among many others. He was buried in the Stockbridge Cemetery in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Memorial services were held on May 22 in London, England, and on May 31 at Trinity Church on Wall Street.

===Descendants===
Through his granddaughter, Helen Choate Platt (1906–1974), he is the great-grandfather of diplomat Nicholas Platt (b. 1936), the former U.S. Ambassador to Zambia, the Philippines, and Pakistan; and the great-great-grandfather of actor Oliver Platt (b. 1960).

===Honors and legacy===
He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by the University of Edinburgh in March 1900; another LL.D. from Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university; an honorary doctorate (D.C.L.) by the University of Oxford in June 1902; and an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews in October 1902. He was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

In 1919, two years after his death, members of the Harvard Club of New York City established the Joseph Hodges Choate Memorial Fellowship at Harvard University to commemorate his life and legacy. It is awarded each year to a student from the University of Cambridge on the recommendation of the Cambridge Vice-Chancellor for study in any Department of Harvard University.

<text>Rufus Choate () (October 1, 1799July 13, 1859) was an American lawyer, orator, and Senator who represented Massachusetts as a member of the Whig Party. He is regarded as one of the greatest American lawyers of the 19th century, arguing over a thousand cases in a lifetime practice extending to virtually every branch of the law then recognized. Notably, he was one of the pioneers of the legal technique of arousing jury sympathy in tort cases. In one instance, he successfully won a record judgement of $22,500 for a badly injured widow, the most ever awarded to a plaintiff at the time.

Along with his colleague and close associate Daniel Webster, he is also regarded as one of the greatest orators of his age. Among his most famous orations are his &quot;Address on The&quot; &quot;Colonial Age of New England&quot; delivered at the centennial celebration of the settlement of Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1831 and his &quot;Address on The Age of the Pilgrims as the Heroic Period of Our History&quot; before the New England Society of New York in 1843. Through these addresses, Choate became one of the most prominent advocates of promoting the Puritan settlers as the first founders of the American republic.

A staunch nationalist and unionist, Choate was among several former Whigs to oppose the Republican Party over concerns that it was a &quot;sectional party&quot; whose platform threatened to separate the Union. In turn, he publicly voiced his support for Democratic candidate James Buchanan over Republican John C. Frémont in the 1856 presidential election.

==Early life==
Rufus Choate was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the son of Miriam (Foster) and David Choate, a teacher and Revolutionary War veteran. He was a descendant of an English family which settled in Massachusetts in 1643. His first cousin, physician George Choate, was the father of George C. S. Choate and Joseph Hodges Choate. Rufus Choate&#x27;s birthplace, Choate House, remains virtually unchanged to this day.

A precocious child, at six he is said to have been able to repeat large parts of the Bible and of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; from memory. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated as valedictorian of his class at Dartmouth College in 1819, was a tutor there in 1819–1820.

In the fall of 1820 he was entered at the Dane Law School in Cambridge, under the instruction of Chief Justice Parker and Professor Asahel Stearns. In the following year Choate studied in Washington, D.C. in the office of William Wirt, then Attorney General of the United States.

==Career==

He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1823 and practiced at what was later South Danvers (now Peabody) for five years, during which time he served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1825–1826) and in the Massachusetts Senate (1827).

In 1828, he moved to Salem, where his successful conduct of several important lawsuits brought him prominently into public notice. In 1830 he was elected to Congress as a Whig from Salem, defeating the Jacksonian candidate for re-election, Benjamin Crowninshield, a former United States Secretary of the Navy, and in 1832 he was re-elected. His career in Congress was marked by a speech in defence of a protective tariff.

In 1834, before the completion of his second term, he resigned and established himself in the practice of law in Boston. Already his reputation as a speaker had spread beyond New England, and he was much sought after as an orator for public occasions. His skill was so great that when he argued cases at the Norfolk County Courthouse, students from the nearby Dedham High School would be dismissed to listen to his orations. For several years, he devoted himself unremittingly to his profession but, in 1841, succeeded fellow Dartmouth graduate Daniel Webster in the United States Senate. Shortly afterwards he delivered an address at the memorial services for President William Henry Harrison at Faneuil Hall.

In the Senate, he spoke on the tariff, the Oregon boundary, in favor of the Fiscal Bank Act, and in opposition to the annexation of Texas. On Webster&#x27;s re-election to the Senate in 1845, Choate resumed his law practice. He later served a short term as attorney-general of Massachusetts in 1853–1854. In 1846, Choate convinced a jury that the accused, Albert Tirrell, did not cut the throat of his lover, or, if he did so, he did it while sleepwalking, under the &#x27;insanity of sleep&#x27;. His successful use of sleepwalking as a defense against murder charges was the first time in American legal history this defense was successful in a murder prosecution. He was a faithful supporter of Webster&#x27;s policy as declared in the latter&#x27;s Seventh of March Speech of 1850 and labored to secure for him the presidential nomination at the Whig National Convention in 1852. In 1853, he was a member of the state constitutional convention.

In 1856, he refused to follow most of his former Whig associates into the Republican Party and gave his support to Democrat James Buchanan, whom he considered the representative of a national instead of a sectional party.

== Speeches ==
&quot;The Colonial Age of New England&quot;, 1831.

&quot;The Importance of Illustrating New-England History by a Series of Romances like the Waverly Novels&quot;, 1833.

&quot;The Age of the Pilgrims as the Heroic Period of Our History,&quot; 1843.

&quot;The Positions and Functions of the American Bar, as an Element of Conservatism in the State&quot;, 1845.

&quot;American Nationality&quot;, 1856,

&quot;The Eloquence of Revolutionary Periods&quot;, 1857.

== Health ==
In 1850 Choate traveled Europe for three months to improve his health. He was accompanied by his old friend and well-known lawyer, the Hon. Joseph M. Bell, who married Choate&#x27;s sister, and later his daughter Helen.

In 1859, failing health led him to seek rest yet again in Europe. In June 1859, he sailed from Boston to England, became worse and left the ship at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he died on July 13. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston.

== Family ==
With his wife Helen Olcott, whom he married on March 29, 1825, Choate had seven children: Catherine Bell (1826–1830), an infant child (1828–1828), Helen Olcott Bell (1830–1918), Sarah (1831–1875), Rufus (1834–1866), Miriam Foster (1835–??), and Caroline (1837–1840).

== Legacy ==
Choate&#x27;s private library contained seven thousand books with three thousand volumes in his law library. His childhood home is preserved by the Trustees of Reservations on the Crane Wildlife Refuge. A statue of him stands in the Suffolk County Courthouse in Boston.

<text>The prime minister of Mongolia () is the head of government of Mongolia and heads the Government of Mongolia. The prime minister is appointed by the Mongolian parliament or the State Great Khural, and can be removed by the parliament with a vote of no confidence.

The incumbent prime minister is Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene, who has served since 27 January 2021. He replaced Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh, who was resigned on 22 January 2021.

==Powers==
The prime minister has full powers to hire and fire cabinet ministers and appoints the governors of the 21 aimags of Mongolia, as well as the governor of the capital, Ulaanbaatar.

==History==
The office of prime minister was established by the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia in 1912, shortly after Outer Mongolia first declared independence from the Manchu Qing Dynasty. This was not recognized by many nations in the 1910s. By the time of Mongolia&#x27;s second (and more generally recognized) declaration of independence from the occupation by Beiyang China in 1921, the office was controlled by a communist group known as the time Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. 1924 the party established the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, and the prime minister&#x27;s post was superseded by one known by the chairman of the council of people&#x27;s commissars. This was changed to chairman of the council of ministers in 1946. The title of prime minister was only revived in 1990, when the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party gradually released its hold on power. Regardless of the changes of name, however, the modern Mongolian government recognizes the office as having existed continuously since 1912, and counts all holders of the office as prime ministers.

There is some confusion as to the first holder of the office. A lama named Tseren (or Tserenchimed) held office as &quot;prime minister&quot; (actually the Interior minister) during a provisional government, and is sometimes cited as the first holder of the modern office. However, the Mongolian government considers Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren, the first formal office-holder, to be the first. There is also some confusion over the status of Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav, some consider him to have only been acting Prime Minister, while some consider him to have been a full Prime Minister. The Mongolian government takes the latter view.

<doc id="439906" wikidata="Q7945967" url="?curid=439906" title="W. S. Graham">
<text>William Sydney Graham (19 November 1918 – 9 January 1986) was a Scottish poet, who was often associated with Dylan Thomas and the neo-romantic group of poets. Graham&#x27;s poetry was mostly overlooked in his lifetime; however, partly thanks to the support of Harold Pinter, his work was eventually acknowledged. He was represented in the second edition of the &quot;Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse&quot; (Harmondsworth, UK, 1962) and the &quot;Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2001).

==Early life and work==

Graham was born in Greenock. In 1932, he left school to become an apprentice draughtsman and then studied structural engineering at Stow College, Glasgow. He was awarded a bursary to study literature for a year at Newbattle Abbey College in 1938. Graham spent the war years working at a number of jobs in Scotland and Ireland before moving to Cornwall in 1944. His first book, &quot;Cage Without Grievance&quot; was published in 1942.

==Graham and the neo-romantics==
The 1940s were prolific years for Graham, and he published four more books during that decade. These were &quot;The Seven Journeys&quot; (1944), &quot;2ND Poems&quot; (1945), &quot;The Voyages of Alfred Wallis&quot; (1948) and &quot;The White Threshold&quot; (1949). The style of these early poems led critics to see Graham as part of the neo-romantic group that included Dylan Thomas and George Barker. The affinities between these three poets derive from a common interest in poets like Gerard Manley Hopkins, Arthur Rimbaud and Hart Crane, and, in the case of Thomas and Graham, a taste for the Bohemian lifestyle of the London literary scene.

In 1947, Graham received the Atlantic Award for Literature, and lectured at New York University whilst spending a year on a reading touring of the United States. He moved to London to be nearer the hub of its Bohemian world. Here he came into contact with T. S. Eliot, then editor of Faber and Faber, who published &quot;The White Threshold&quot;, which includes varied recollections of his childhood and youth in Scotland. Faber and Faber remained Graham&#x27;s publishers for the rest of his life.

==&quot;The Nightfishing&quot; and legacy==
In 1954, Graham returned to Cornwall to live near the St Ives, Cornwall artists&#x27; colony. Here he became friendly with several of the resident painters, including Bryan Wynter and Roger Hilton. The following year, Faber and Faber published his &quot;The Nightfishing,&quot; a book whose title poem marked a dramatic change in Graham&#x27;s poetry. The poem moved on from his earlier style and moved away from the neo-romantic/apocalyptic tag. Unfortunately for the poet, the poem&#x27;s appearance coincided with the rise of the Movement with their open hostility to the neo-romantics. Despite the support of Eliot and Hugh MacDiarmid, the book was neither a critical nor a popular success.

It was to be fifteen years before Graham published another book, &quot;Malcolm Mooney&#x27;s Land&quot; (1970). This, and his last book, &quot;Implements in Their Places&quot; are truly original and enduring poetic achievements, for which Graham is slowly coming to be recognised. For many years, he had lived in semi-poverty on his income as a writer, but in 1974 he received a Civil List pension of £500 per year. Perhaps because of this alleviation of his financial circumstances, Graham began to publish with more frequency, with &quot;Implements in their Places&quot; (1977), &quot;Collected Poems 1942–1977&quot; (1979) and an American-published &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1980). He died in Madron, Cornwall in 1986. His last collection &quot;Aimed at Nobody&quot; was published posthumously in 1993, and a book of &quot;Uncollected Poems&quot; appeared in 1990. Faber brought out a new &quot;Selected Poems&quot; in 1996. &quot;The Nightfisherman: Selected Letters&quot; was published in 1999 and &quot;New Collected Poems&quot; in 2005.

All of Graham&#x27;s poems have a location, a plot and setting (or narrative) as Graham insisted &quot;the first act of engagement of reader and poem was in reading it aloud. This tested the syntax, pace and tone of poem and reader.&quot;

Posthumous publication activity indicates Graham&#x27;s reputation has grown in recent years. Some might argue this is partly due to Harold Pinter&#x27;s often-expressed enthusiasm for the poet, or attribute his increasing recognition to the widespread advocacy of poets associated with the British Poetry Revival. However, Graham&#x27;s work was represented in the anthology &quot;Conductors of Chaos&quot; (1996) by a selection introduced by the poet and critic Tony Lopez, who also wrote a book-length study, &quot;The Poetry of W. S. Graham&quot; (1989).

==Marriage, death and recognition==

He married another poet, Agnes Kilpatrick Dunsmuir (1909–1999), known as Nessie Dunsmuir. Graham died on 9 January 1986, aged 67. In 2006, 20 years after his death, memorial plaques were unveiled in Fore Street, Madron where he spent his final years, and at his birthplace, 1 Hope Street, Greenock.

In an event to mark his centenary year, a memorial stone to Graham was unveiled in the Makars&#x27; Court, Edinburgh on 14 June 2018, and Graham&#x27;s daughter Rosalind Mudaliar donated his writing chair to the Scottish Poetry Library. Copyright in Graham&#x27;s works is held by his daughter, Rosalind Mudaliar.

<text>was a Japanese Buddhist priest, credited with founding the Rinzai school, the Japanese line of the Linji school of Zen Buddhism. In 1191, he introduced this Zen approach to Japan, following his trip to China from 1187 to 1191, during which he was initiated into the Linji school by the master Hsü an. It is also said that he popularized green tea in Japan, following this same trip. He was also the founding abbot of Japan&#x27;s first Zen temple Shōfuku-ji and Kennin-ji. He is often known simply as Eisai/Yōsai Zenji (栄西禅師), literally &quot;Zen master Eisai&quot;.

==Biography==

Born in Bitchū Province (modern-day Okayama, Okayama), Eisai was ordained as a monk in the Tendai sect. Dissatisfied with the state of Buddhism at the time, in 1168 he set off on his first trip to Mount Tiantai in China, the origin of the sect, where he learned of the primacy of the Chan (later known in Japan as Zen) school in Chinese Buddhism of the time. He spent only six months in China on this first trip, but returned in 1187 for a longer stay as a disciple of Xuan Huaichang, a master in the Linji (Rinzai) line, at Jingde Si (Ching-te-ssu, 景德寺) monastery.

After his certification as a Zen teacher, Eisai returned to Japan in 1191, bringing with him Zen scriptures and green tea seeds. He immediately founded the Shōfuku-ji in Kyūshū, Japan&#x27;s first Zen temple. The prayer rituals and recitation of sutras that Eisai integrated into his monastic routines can be traced back to the Rules of Purity established during the Chinese Song dynasty.

Eisai set about slowly propagating the new faith, trying to gain the respect of both the Tendai school and the Imperial court through careful diplomacy. Faced with the sometimes violent opposition of traditional schools of Buddhism such as Tendai, Shingon and Pure Land, Eisai finally left Kyoto for the north-east to Kamakura in 1199, where the &quot;shōgun&quot; and the newly ascendant warrior class enthusiastically welcomed his teachings. Hōjō Masako, Yoritomo&#x27;s widow, allowed him to build Jufuku-ji, the first Zen temple in Kamakura. Eisai founded Kennin-ji in Kyoto in 1202 on land gifted to him by Yoritomo&#x27;s son, the second Kamakura &quot;shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoriie. Eisai died in 1215 at the age of 74, and is buried in Kennin-ji&#x27;s temple grounds.

One feature of Eisai&#x27;s activity not often noted is his continued eclecticism. He never renounced his status as a Tendai monk, and until the end of his life continued to engage in Tendai esoteric practices. Though he is credited with transmission of the Rinzai line to Japan, it remained for later teachers to establish a distinctly Japanese Zen free of admixture with the teachings of other schools. Among his notable disciples was Eihei Dōgen, who himself traveled to China and returned to found the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan.

==Importing green tea==

Eisai is also credited with the beginning of the tea tradition in Japan, by bringing green tea seeds from China, back from his second trip in 1191, and writing the book 喫茶養生記, &quot;Kissa Yōjōki&quot; (in English, &quot;Drinking Tea for Health&quot;). Legend says that he planted the seeds &quot;in the garden of the Ishigamibo at Seburiyama in Hizen&quot;.

In addition to his book, Eisai also garnered attention from another act involving his tea; using it as treatment for &quot;shōgun&quot; Sanetomo. This is a record of his treatment from the &quot;Azuma Kagami&quot;:

:&quot;The &quot;shōgun&quot; was taken a bit ill, and various attendants attempted to treat him. This was not so serious but was from overindulgence in wine the previous evening. The priest Yojo, who had come to perform incantations and learned the situation, brought a bowl of tea from his temple, saying it was good medicine. He also asked the attendants to give the &quot;shōgun&quot; a scroll of writings about the virtues of tea, and the &quot;shōgun&quot; was said to have been greatly pleased. Priest Yojo indicated he had written it recently during his breaks from meditation.&quot;

Eisai was more focused on the medicinal aspects than anything else, and the main reason for this was the common conception of the time that the world was in &quot;mappō&quot;, the Latter age of the Dharma, which was considered by many to be a time of decline. Eisai lived through an era of heavy fighting in Japan, so &quot;mappō&quot; played a big role in his promotion of tea, as he thought it was a cure for many ailments and hence would help people get through this perceived difficult time.

In &quot;Kissa Yōjōki&quot;, the beginning bulk of text after the prefaces concern the alignment of the five elements of Chinese science (earth, fire, water, wood, and metal) with five major organs (the liver, lungs, heart, spleen, and kidneys) and the respective five flavors that each major organ preferred (acidic, pungent, bitter, sweet, and salty). Eisai claimed that the standard Japanese fare of the time contained abundant amounts of each, except for the bitter flavor, which was the cause of the many heart diseases the Japanese suffered from. He asserted that his green tea was essential for providing the bitter flavor, and thereby keeping the heart healthy.

== Promotion of Buddhism ==
During the Nara and Heian periods in Japan, Buddhism was used as a tool to unify the country. Eisai was a firm believer that it should be Zen Buddhism to aid the protection of the country. He identified previously established schools of Buddhism as responsible for contributing to Japan&#x27;s struggles.

During this time, three major scriptures were used to promote this idea of a unified Buddhist Japan: the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot;, and the &quot;Humane King Sutra&quot; (&quot;Ninnōkyō&quot;). Eisai&#x27;s famous written piece, , was heavily influenced by the &quot;Humane King Sutra&quot;, which states, &quot;The preservation of Buddhism is inextricably bound to the preservation of their own country&quot;. The &quot;Kōzen gokokuron&quot; was written with the intention to correct established schools of Buddhism by giving them examples of moral practice and to convince the Minamoto military rulers to support Zen Buddhism and a Zen government. The writing promotes the Zen ideals to bring Buddhism back to its morals and practices.

Eisai&#x27;s writing depends heavily on the idea that Buddhism is critical for a functioning society. The &quot;Kōzen gokokuron&quot; is often regarded as nationalistic propaganda, and due to the compromises he made when working to install Zen Buddhism in Japan, people disregard the significance of the &quot;Kōzen gokokuron&quot; when reading it from a &quot;pure&quot; Zen perspective.

<text>The First Army was a formation of the British Army that existed during the First and Second World Wars. The First Army included Indian and Portuguese forces during the First World War and American and French units during the Second World War.

==First World War==
The First Army was part of the British Army during the First World War and was formed on 26 December 1914 when the corps of the British Expeditionary Force were divided into the First Army under Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig and the Second Army under Horace Smith-Dorrien. First Army had the Ist, IVth and the Indian Corps under command. It made advances of 1,200 yards at the beginning of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 before the momentum died out. The First Army suffered reverses at Vimy Ridge in May 1916 and at Fromelles the following month. From 1917, the First Army also included the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. The First Army took part in the 1918 offensive that drove the Germans back and virtually ended the war.

===Commanders===
* 26 December 1914 – 22 December 1915 General Sir Douglas Haig
* 22 December 1915 – 4 February 1916 General Sir Henry Rawlinson
* 4 February – 7 August 1916 General Sir Charles Monro
* 7 August – 30 September 1916 Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Haking (temporary)
* 30 September 1916 – 1918 General Sir Henry Horne

==Second World War==

The British First Army was reformed during the Second World War. It was formed to command the American and British land forces which had landed as part of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, in Morocco and Algeria on 8 November 1942. It was commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Kenneth Anderson. The First Army headquarters was formally activated on 9 November 1942 when Anderson arrived in Algiers to assume command of the redesignated Eastern Task Force.

The First Army initially consisted of American and British formations only. After the surrender of French forces following the German abrogation of their armistice agreement with Vichy France, French units were also added to the First Army&#x27;s order of battle. It eventually consisted of four corps, the US II Corps, the British V Corps, British IX Corps and French XIX Corps.

After the landings, Anderson&#x27;s forces rushed east in a bid to capture Tunis and Bizerte before German forces could reach the two cities in large numbers. They failed. Following that lack of success, a period of consolidation was forced upon them. The logistics support for the First Army was greatly improved and bases for its accompanying aircraft greatly multiplied. By the time General Sir Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s British Eighth Army approached the Tunisian border from the east, following its long pursuit of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel&#x27;s forces after El Alamein, the First Army was again ready to strike.

Supported by elements of XII Tactical Air Command and No. 242 Group RAF, the First Army carried the main weight of General Sir Harold Alexander&#x27;s 18th Army Group&#x27;s offensive to conclude the Tunisian Campaign and finish Axis forces in North Africa off. The victory was won in May 1943 in a surrender that, in numbers captured at least, equalled Stalingrad. Shortly after the surrender, the First Army was disbanded, having served its purpose.

===Commanders===
*July 1942 – August 1942 Lieutenant-General Edmond Schreiber
*August 1942 – July 1943 Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson
