<text>Earl of Carlisle is a title that has been created three times in the Peerage of England.

== History ==
The first creation came in 1322, when Andrew Harclay, 1st Baron Harclay, was made Earl of Carlisle. He had already been summoned to Parliament as Lord Harclay (or Lord Harcla) in 1321. However, Lord Carlisle was executed for treason in 1323, with his titles forfeited.

The second creation came in 1622, when James Hay, 1st Viscount Doncaster, was made Earl of Carlisle. He was a great favourite of James I and had already been created Lord Hay in the Peerage of Scotland in 1606, as well as Baron Hay, of Sawley in the County of York, and Viscount Doncaster in 1618. The latter titles were in the Peerage of England. Lord Carlisle was the member of a junior branch of the Hay family, headed by the Earl of Erroll. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Earl. In 1637, he also succeeded his maternal grandfather, Charles Goring, 2nd Earl of Norwich, as second Baron Denny (a title created by writ in 1604; see Earl of Norwich). However, Carlisle was childless and on his death in 1660, all the titles became extinct.

The third creation came in 1660, when Sir Charles Howard was made Baron Dacre of Gillesland, in the County of Cumberland, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, in the County of Northumberland, and Earl of Carlisle. A member of the prominent Howard family, he was the great-grandson of Lord William Howard, third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Lord William Howard&#x27;s wife was Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre (of Gillesland), a title which had fallen into abeyance on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. Through this marriage, Naworth Castle and Henderskelfe Castle (which later became the site of Castle Howard) came into the Howard family. Lord Carlisle had earlier supported the Parliamentarian cause in the Civil War, and he is supposed to have been created &quot;Baron Gilsland&quot; and &quot;Viscount Howard of Morpeth&quot; by Oliver Cromwell in 1657 (it is certain that he was summoned to Cromwell&#x27;s House of Lords the same year as &quot;Lord Viscount Howard&quot;).

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Morpeth, Cumberland and Carlisle in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He was a prominent statesman and served as First Lord of the Treasury from 1701 to 1702, and in 1715. His third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, the fifth Earl. He was an influential politician and held office as First Lord of Trade, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, as Lord Steward of the Household and as Lord Privy Seal.

His eldest son, the sixth Earl, also gained political prominence. He served as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests and as Lord Privy Seal, and was Minister without Portfolio between 1830 and 1834 in the famous Whig government of Lord Grey. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He was a noted politician and served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was a clergyman and served as Rector of Londesborough in Yorkshire. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Wentworth George Howard, fifth son of the sixth Earl. He represented Cumberland East in Parliament as a Liberal and was also a well-regarded painter.

His eldest son, the tenth Earl, was Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament for Birmingham South. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl. He married as his first wife Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland (see Lord Ruthven of Freeland for earlier history of this title). On his death in 1963, the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. In 1982, he also succeeded his mother as twelfth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. , the peerages are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1994. Lord Carlisle unsuccessfully contested Easington in the 1987 general election and Leeds West in the 1992 general election.

Several other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. Sir Charles Howard, fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth, eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented Yorkshire before his early death from tuberculosis. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the 10th Hussars and fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, where he was killed in action. His eldest son Frederick John Howard was Member of Parliament for Youghal. The Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Edward John Howard, fourth son of the fifth Earl, was Dean of Lichfield. His third son Edward Henry Howard was a vice-admiral in the Navy.

Admiral the Hon. Edward Granville George Howard, fourth son of the sixth Earl, was created Baron Lanerton in 1874. The aforementioned the Hon. Charles Wentworth George Howard, fifth son of the sixth Earl, represented East Cumberland in Parliament for almost forty years. Lady Harriet Howard, third daughter of the sixth Earl, was the wife of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland. She was Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria and an active Whig in society circles. The Hon. Geoffrey William Algernon Howard, fifth son of the ninth Earl, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. His second son was George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe.

The heir apparent to the earldom, when one exists, is styled &quot;Viscount Morpeth&quot;.

The principal family seat today is Naworth Castle, while Castle Howard is now held by a cadet branch of the family.

<doc id="434134" wikidata="Q491273" url="?curid=434134" title="Earl of Shaftesbury">
<text>Earl of Shaftesbury is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1672 for Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Baron Ashley, a prominent politician in the Cabal then dominating the policies of King Charles II. He had already succeeded his father as second Baronet of Rockbourne in 1631 and been created Baron Ashley, of Wimborne St Giles in the County of Dorset, in 1661, and he was made Baron Cooper, of Paulett in the County of Somerset, at the same time he was given the earldom.

These titles are also in the Peerage of England. Baron Ashley is used as a courtesy title by the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent. The Cooper baronetcy, of Rockbourne in the County of Southampton, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1622 for the Earl&#x27;s father, John Cooper. He sat as Member of Parliament for Poole.

The current holder is Nicholas Ashley-Cooper (born 1979).

==History==
The first Earl was succeeded by his son, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 2nd Earl of Shaftesbury. He represented Melcombe Regis and Weymouth in the House of Commons. His son, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, succeeded as the 3rd Earl upon his death. The 3rd Earl sat as a Member of Parliament, but is chiefly remembered as a writer and philosopher. On his death, the titles passed to his son, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, who became the 4th Earl. The 4th Earl notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset and Councillor of the Colony of Georgia. He died in 1771, at which time, his son inherited the title of 5th Earl.

Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 5th Earl of Shaftesbury, was educated at Winchester and served as Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset. Cropley Ashley-Cooper, younger brother of the 5th Earl, inherited the title of 6th Earl upon the death of his older brother in 1811. The 6th Earl represented Dorchester in Parliament. He served as member of the Privy Council and Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. Upon his death, the title was passed to his son. The 7th Earl was a prominent politician, social reformer and philanthropist. He was known as the reforming Lord Shaftesbury in the 19th century, who fought for the abolition of slavery. His eldest son, the 8th Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull and Cricklade. He was succeeded by his son, the 9th Earl, who was the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Lord Lieutenant of Belfast, County Antrim and Dorset and Lord Steward of the Household. The 9th Earl was predeceased by his elder son Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley, in 1947; on the 9th Earl&#x27;s death in 1961, the titles passed to his grandson, the 10th Earl, son of Lord Ashley.

In 2004, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury, was murdered by his third wife, Jamila M&#x27;Barek, and her brother. They were convicted of the crime in 2007, two years after the 10th Earl&#x27;s body was found dismembered in the French Alps. The 10th Earl was succeeded by his elder son Anthony Ashley Cooper, 11th Earl of Shaftesbury. In May 2005, six months after succeeding to the earldom, the 11th Earl died of a heart attack in New York City, while visiting his younger brother Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, who succeeded him as 12th Earl.

===Other family members===
Other prominent members of the family include Liberal politician Evelyn Ashley, second son of the 7th Earl; his son, noted politician Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple, was a member of the Conservative Party, and his daughter Edwina married Louis Mountbatten and was to be last Vicereine of India.

Upon that marriage the Earls of Shaftesbury began close social links to the royal family. Lady Mountbatten was a leading member of London society. Edwina&#x27;s mother was Amalia Mary Maud Cassel (1879–1911), daughter of the international magnate Sir Ernest Cassel, a friend and private financier to the future King Edward VII and one of the richest men in Europe.

When her grandfather died in 1921, Edwina inherited his vast fortune, which included £2 million, the country seat of Broadlands, Romsey, Hampshire; Brook House in London; Moulton Paddocks estate in Newmarket, Suffolk; Classiebawn Castle, Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland; and a seaside house at Branksome Dene in Bournemouth. They married on 18 July 1922 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. The monarch&#x27;s immediate family attended; the then-Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) was the best man. The relationship between the families continues, as descendants have often been royal godchildren.

It was at Broadlands that Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, spent their honeymoon night in 1947. In turn, Prince Charles and his first wife, Lady Diana Spencer, spent their honeymoon night there in 1981.

==St Giles House==
The family seat is St Giles House (sometimes referred to as Ashley House) near Wimborne St Giles in Dorset. The estate at Wimborne St Giles came into the ownership of the Ashley family around the year 1460, through the marriage of Egidia Hamelyn and Robert Ashley, the 5th great grandfather of the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.

Early owners of the estate included the Malmayne family. Matilda Malmayne, heiress of the estate, married Edmund Plecy. The Plecy male line became extinct towards the end of the fourteenth century, and the estate was transferred to Edmund and Matilda&#x27;s descendant Joan Plecy, as heiress. Lady Joan Plecy was soon married to Sir John Hamelyn (d. 1399), but with no male heirs, the estate went to Sir John&#x27;s daughter Egidia, by his second wife, who married Robert Ashley. The estate has belonged to the Ashleys and Ashley-Coopers ever since.

Construction on St Giles House began in 1651, by Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, later to become 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. The manor house is built on top of the ruins of the previous estate home. This large house and surrounding grounds include , along with a seven-acre lake and a avenue of trees. The family also owns Lough Neagh, the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles.

As noted by Christopher Hussey in his article on St Giles&#x27; House, &quot;The whole, so little changed in two centuries, is a splendid example of the Kent manner changing into the rococo of the mid-century.&quot; However, following World War II, the contents of these rooms have been gradually dispersed in a number of sales. The record of these and a number of published articles indicate that the design of the furniture shows a highly accomplished progression from the architectural Palladian style to the full fanciful rococo style. The accomplished design, together with the high level of craftsmanship, clearly indicate a metropolitan origin for the majority of these pieces, but unfortunately the surviving Shaftesbury Account Books contain few references to London cabinet-makers other than William Hallett, his name appearing a number of times between 1745 and 1757 with references to &#x27;carved chairs,&#x27; &#x27;the Blew Bed,&#x27; and &#x27;Mahogany Cisterns.&#x27; The payments to other cabinet-makers mentioned in accounts are small in nature and probably indicate their local origins.

The Shaftesburys are known to have had connections with London cabinet makers. The 4th Earl&#x27;s wife, Lady Susannah Noel, daughter of Baptist Noel, 3rd Earl of Gainsborough, was one of the 26 aristocratic subscribers to the first edition of Thomas Chippendale&#x27;s Director (1754). His second wife, Lady Mary Bouverie, was the daughter of the 1st Viscount Folkestone who was a major patron of William Hallett and Benjamin Goodison, her brother the 2nd Viscount acquiring pieces from the Royal cabinetmakers William Vile and John Cobb.

==South Carolina==
The Ashley and Cooper rivers in South Carolina were named for the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who was the Chief Lord Proprietor of the Carolina Colony. Charleston was founded on the western bank of the Ashley in 1670 (at Charles Towne Landing), before moving across to its current peninsular location ten years later.

<doc id="434138" wikidata="Q1137044" url="?curid=434138" title="Count Belisarius">
<text>Count Belisarius is a historical novel by Robert Graves, first published in 1938, recounting the life of the Roman general Belisarius (AD 500–565).

Just as Graves&#x27;s Claudius novels (&quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God and His Wife Messalina&quot;) were based on &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; of Suetonius and other Roman sources, &quot;Count Belisarius&quot; is largely based on Procopius&#x27;s &quot;History of Justinian&#x27;s Wars&quot; and &quot;Secret History&quot;. However, Graves&#x27;s treatment of his sources has been criticized by the historian Anthony Kaldellis, who writes that &quot;There are many historical novels set in the early sixth century, but none can be recommended that are both historically accurate and well-written. R. Graves&#x27;s &quot;Count Belisarius&quot;... is at least well-written.&quot;

&quot;Count Belisarius&quot; purports to be a biography written by Eugenius, a eunuch who is a servant of Belisarius&#x27; wife Antonina. The novel covers the entire life of Belisarius, with the bulk of the text being devoted to accounts of his life while on campaign in North Africa and Italy. Antonina was often with him during these years, and Graves uses stories about her connections to the court of the Emperor Justinian and his Empress Theodora to incorporate political intrigue and other information into the story of Belisarius&#x27; military exploits.

<doc id="434140" wikidata="Q2328818" url="?curid=434140" title="Hulder">
<text>A hulder (or huldra) is a seductive forest creature found in Scandinavian folklore. Her name derives from a root meaning &quot;covered&quot; or &quot;secret&quot;. In Norwegian folklore, she is known as huldra (&quot;the [archetypal] hulder&quot;, though folklore presupposes that there is an entire Hulder race and not just a single individual). She is known as the [[skogsrå]] &quot;forest spirit&quot; or Tallemaja &quot;pine tree Mary&quot; in Swedish folklore, and  in Sámi folklore. Her name suggests that she is originally the same being as the völva divine figure Huld and the German Holda.

The word hulder is only used of a female; a &quot;male hulder&quot; is called a &quot;huldrekall&quot; and also appears in Norwegian folklore. This being is closely related to other underground dwellers, usually called &quot;tusser&quot; (sg., &quot;tusse&quot;).

Though described as beautiful, the huldra is noted for having a distinctive inhuman feature—an animal&#x27;s tail (usually a cow&#x27;s or a fox&#x27;s) and/or a back resembling a hollowed-out tree.

==Folklore==

The hulder is one of several &quot;rå&quot; (keeper, warden), including the aquatic &quot;sjörå&quot; or &quot;havsfru&quot;, later identified with a mermaid, and the &quot;bergsrå&quot; in caves and mines who made life tough for the poor miners.

More information can be found in the collected Norwegian folktales of Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe.

===Relations with humans===

The hulders were held to be kind to charcoal burners, watching their charcoal kilns while they rested. Knowing that she would wake them if there were any problems, they were able to sleep, and in exchange they left provisions for her in a special place. A tale from Närke illustrates further how kind a hulder could be, especially if treated with respect (Hellström 1985:15).

==Toponyms==

A multitude of places in Scandinavia are named after the Hulders, often places by legend associated with the presence of the &quot;hidden folk&quot;. Here are some examples showing the wide distribution of Hulder-related toponyms between the northern and southern reaches of Scandinavia, and the terms usage in different language groups&#x27; toponyms.

===Danish===
* &quot;Huldremose&quot; (Hulder Bog) is a bog on Djursland, Denmark famous for the discovery of the Huldremose Woman, a bog body from 55BC.

===Norwegian===
* &quot;Hulderheim&quot; is southeast on the island of Karlsøya in Troms county, Norway. The name means &quot;Home of the Hulder&quot;.
* &quot;Hulderhusan&quot; is an area on the southwest part of Norway&#x27;s largest island, Hinnøya, whose name means &quot;Houses of the Hulders&quot;.

===Sámi===
* &quot;Ulddaidvárri&quot; is a place in Kvænangen Municipality in Troms county (Norway). The name means &quot;Mountain of the Hulders&quot; in North Sámi.
* &quot;Ulddašvággi&quot; is a valley southwest of Alta in Finnmark county (Norway). The name means &quot;Hulder Valley&quot; in North Sámi. The peak guarding the pass over from the valley to the mountains above has a similar name, Ruollačohkka, meaning &quot;Troll Mountain&quot;—and the large mountain presiding over the valley on its northern side is called Háldi, which is a term similar to the above-mentioned Norwegian rå, that is a spirit or local deity which rules a specific area.

==In Popular Culture==
In the mobile game &quot;Year Walk,&quot; one of the Watchers is a Huldra.

They are mentioned in Seanan MacGuire&#x27;s October Daye series in the book &quot;A red-rose chain&quot;.

Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novella &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot;, published in the collection &quot;Fragile Things&quot;, includes references to Hulder legends.

In the subsequent &quot;Year Walk: Bedtime Stories for Awful Children,&quot; the first chapter is devoted to the Huldra.

In chapter 40 (chapter XL: &quot;A day in Hälsingland&quot;, section: &quot;The Animals&#x27; New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;) of the novel &quot;Nils Holgersson&#x27;s Wonderful Journey through Sweden&quot;, a narrated legend mentions the Huldra.

In the video game &quot;Bramble: The Mountain King,&quot; developed by Dimfrost Studios in 2023, the boss Skogsrå is a Huldra.

<doc id="434143" wikidata="Q774818" url="?curid=434143" title="Molalla River">
<text>The Molalla River is a tributary of the Willamette River in the northwestern part of Oregon in the United States. Flowing northwest from the Cascade Range through Table Rock Wilderness, it passes the city of Molalla before entering the larger river near Canby. The Molalla is the largest Willamette tributary unblocked by a dam.

==Course==
The river&#x27;s headwaters are in Clackamas County, near the Table Rock Wilderness, in the Cascade Range. Flowing generally north-northwest from the mountains, the river enters the Willamette Valley and flows past the city of Molalla. It is joined by the Pudding River shortly before entering the Willamette near the city of Canby. The confluence is about from the Willamette&#x27;s mouth on the Columbia River. The Molalla River is the largest free-flowing tributary of the Willamette.

Named tributaries from source to mouth are Henry, Ogle, Mining Iron, Lake, Scorpion, Hay Barn, Minnette, Dungeon, Avalanche, and Bull creeks, followed by Table Rock Fork. Below that are Horse, Gawley, Cow, Bear, Shotgun, Pine, and Trout creeks followed by the North Fork Molalla River. Then come Russell, Cedar, Dickey, Woodcock, Milk, and Gribble creeks, then the Pudding River.

===Discharge===
The average discharge of the river at the mouth is . Above the confluence with the Pudding River, the average discharge is , about half of the flow at the mouth.

==History==
During the early 19th century, the area around the river was populated by the Molala people. During that time, an extensive system of trails along the river allowed trade between the peoples of the Willamette Valley and eastern Oregon. As late as the 1920s, the trails were used by Native Americans from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation to reach huckleberry-picking grounds near Table Rock.

Starting in about 1840, European-American settlers began farming in the bottomlands along the lower Molalla. Spurred by passage of the Donation Land Claim Act, the influx continued, and by 1860 there were 75 households in the Molalla area. Wheat was the most common crop, and these early settlers also cultivated potatoes and root vegetables such as turnips and cabbages, and planted apple trees. They fished, hunted, gathered huckleberries, and kept sheep, cows, pigs and chickens.

Gold mining occurred along the Molalla after the discovery of placer gold in 1860. Many claims were filed during the next 40 years. Four mining companies, of which the Ogle Mountain Mining Company was the biggest, had operations in the watershed by the early 20th century. The company operated a mine along Ogle Creek, a Molalla tributary, between 1903 and 1915.

In the 20th century, the watershed became an area of intense logging. Timber companies built forest roads and a spur railroad, set up timber camps, constructed splash dams, and used the river and Milk Creek for transporting logs. Between 1941 and 1945, hundreds of log trucks passed through Molalla every day.

==Bridges==

This is a list of bridges and other crossings of the Molalla River from its confluence with the Willamette River upstream to its source in the Cascade Range.


===Knight&#x27;s Bridge===
Knight&#x27;s Bridge was a wooden covered bridge built in 1877 over the Molalla River on the western city limit of Canby. The bridge was destroyed in 1947. In 1964, a steel bridge with a concrete deck replaced the former crossing. It is long with a deck width of and carries Knight&#x27;s Bridge Road, a two-lane thoroughfare, over the river.

==Recreation==
===Parks===
Molalla River State Park is a day-use area, part of the Willamette Greenway, where the Molalla, Pudding, and Willamette rivers converge, north of Canby. Used mainly for recreation by local residents, its attractions include fishing, boating, water-skiing, picnicking, and wildlife viewing. It has a nature trail, restrooms, a boat launch, and an area for flying radio-controlled aircraft. Among its features is a rookery for great blue herons, among the largest in the Willamette Valley.

Feyrer Park, a county park, is along the river southeast of Molalla at Dickey Prairie. It has 20 sites for camping in tents or recreational vehicles (RV)s, all supplied with water and electric hook-ups. Other amenities include picnic tables, horseshoe pits, and access to fishing.

===Hiking===
Table Rock Wilderness, of rugged forest land added to the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1984, is southeast of Molalla along the headwaters of the river. Overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, it has four trailheads—Table Rock, Old Bridge, Rooster Rock, and Bull Creek—linked to a network of hiking and horse-riding trails.

===Boating===
Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run the upper reaches of the Molalla River as well as the lower. Under certain conditions, the stretch from Copper Creek to Table Rock Fork can be navigated by boaters capable of handling technical class III (intermediate) to IV (advanced) water on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Below that comes a stretch, about long, of class III to III+ water. Hazards on these upper miles may include narrow chutes, sudden drops, and logs in the water. The next , Turner Bridge to Glen Avon Bridge, are rated technical class III to IV with hazards similar to the upper reaches but also including scouting difficulties as well as a dangerous undercut at a rapids called Goldilocks.

The lower reaches are much gentler. The run from Glen Avon Bridge to Freyer Park is rated class II (novice). Here the most difficult rapids occur in the first half of the run. Below that come of class I (beginner) water from Freyer Park to the Oregon 213 Bridge.

===Fishing===
The river supports populations of smallmouth bass near the confluence with the Willamette River and of wild cutthroat trout in the upper reaches and tributaries. Trout fishing is limited to catch and release as is angling for wild steelhead or Chinook salmon, which also frequent the Molalla.

<doc id="434152" wikidata="Q1057365" url="?curid=434152" title="Roof of the World">
<text>The Roof of the World or Top of the World is a metaphoric epithet or phrase used to describe the highest region in the world, also known as High Asia. The term usually refers to the mountainous interior of Asia, including the Pamirs, the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, the Hindu Kush, the Tian Shan, the country of Nepal, and the Altai Mountains.

== Attested usage ==
The British explorer John Wood, writing in 1838, described &quot;Bam-i-Duniah&quot; (Roof of the World) as a &quot;native expression&quot; (presumably Wakhi), and it was generally used for the Pamirs in Victorian times: In 1876, another British traveler, Sir Thomas Edward Gordon, employed it as the title of a book and wrote in Chapter IX:
: &quot;We were now about to cross the famous &#x27;Bam-i-Dunya&#x27;, &#x27;The Roof of the World&#x27; under which name the elevated region of the hitherto comparatively unknown Pamir tracts had long appeared in our maps.[...] Wood, in 1838, was the first European traveler of modern times to visit the Great Pamir,&quot;. 
Older encyclopedias also used &quot;Roof of the World&quot; to describe the Pamirs:
*&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, 11th ed. (1911): &quot;PAMIRS, a mountainous region of central Asia...the Bam-i-Dunya (&#x27;The Roof of the World&#x27;)&quot;.
*&quot;The Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;, 1942 edition: &quot;the Pamirs (Persian = roof of the world)&quot;.
* Hachette, 1890: &quot;Le Toit du monde (Pamir)&quot;, French for &quot;Roof of the World (Pamir)&quot;.
* Der Große Brockhaus, Leipzig 1928–1935: &quot;Dach der Welt, Bezeichnung für das Hochland von Pamir&quot;, i.e., &quot;roof of the world, term describing the Pamir highlands&quot;, and (in translation): &quot;Pamir highlands, the nodal point of the mountain systems of Tien-Shan, Kun-lun, Karakoram, the Himalayas and Hindukush, and therefore called the roof of the world.&quot;

With the awakening of public interest in Tibet, the Pamirs, &quot;since 1875 ... probably the best explored region in High Asia&quot;, went out of the limelight and the description &quot;Roof of the World&quot; has been increasingly applied to Tibet and the Tibetan Plateau, and occasionally, especially in French (&quot;Toit du monde&quot;), even to Mount Everest, but the traditional use is still alive.

<text>The University of Regina is a public university located in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Founded in 1911 as a private denominational high school of the Methodist Church of Canada, it began an association with the University of Saskatchewan as a junior college in 1925, and was disaffiliated by the Church and fully ceded to the university in 1934; in 1961 it attained degree-granting status as the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan. It became an autonomous university in 1974. The University of Regina has an enrolment of over 15,000 full and part-time students. The university&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Carillon&quot;, is a member of CUP.

The University of Regina is a research university reputed for having a focus on experiential learning and offers internships, professional placements and practicums in addition to cooperative education placements in 41 programs. In 2009 the University of Regina launched the UR Guarantee Program, a program guaranteeing participating students a successful career launch after graduation by supplementing education with experience to achieve specific educational, career and life goals. Partnership agreements with provincial crown corporations, government departments and private corporations have helped the University of Regina both place students in work experience opportunities and help gain employment post-study. Record enrolment was seen in September 2023 with a quarter of those students being international.

==History==

===Origins===

The University of Regina is a non-denominational university, which grew out of Regina College, founded in 1911. In direct response to the award of the University of Saskatchewan to Saskatoon rather than Regina, the Methodist Church of Canada established Regina College in 1911 on College Avenue in Regina, Saskatchewan, starting with an enrolment of 27 students; it was adjacent to the now long-defunct St Chad&#x27;s College (a theological seminary for the training of Anglican clergy) and Qu&#x27;Appelle Diocesan School, also on College Avenue. James Henry Puntin (architect) designed several buildings on campus including: Regina Methodist College (1910); East &amp; West Towers (1914); Ladies Residence (1914); Gymnasium (1925); Power Plant (1927); Music &amp; Arts Building (1928). &quot;In 1928, Darke Hall was built on College Avenue, [d]escribed...as &quot;an admirable theatre, one which few cities can rival.&quot;

In 1934 Regina College became part of the University of Saskatchewan. The University of Saskatchewan a single, public provincial university created in 1907 was modeled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modeled on the &quot;University of Toronto Act&quot;, 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership. In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.

Regina College commenced a formal association with the University of Saskatchewan as a junior college offering accredited university courses in 1925 though continuing as a denominational college of the now-United Church of Canada, the successor to the Methodist Church. Regina College continued as a Junior College until 1959, when it received full degree-granting status as a second campus of the University of Saskatchewan.
However, in 1934, the United Church was financially hard pressed by the Great Depression and in any case its history from the great Egerton Ryerson of urgent advocacy of universal free public education made its involvement in private schools anomalous. It accordingly fully surrendered Regina College to the University of Saskatchewan. Regina College and its successor Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan and University of Regina have retained the Methodist motto &quot;as one who serves&quot; (Luke 22.27).

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In 1961 the college was renamed the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus. In 1974 it became the independent University of Regina.

The original United Church affiliation is, however, symbolically commemorated in the convocation furniture, resumed by the university for ceremonial use from one of the last downtown United Churches, which closed in the 1990s.

===University of Saskatchewan affiliation===

With the transfer of control to the University of Saskatchewan the range of courses offered was somewhat broadened. During this period Campion and Luther Colleges, which maintained private high schools in Regina under the auspices respectively of the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches, also retained junior college status in affiliation with the University of Saskatchewan; the Anglican Church (then known as the Church of England in Canada), whose St Chad&#x27;s College had operated a theological training facility in Regina but had never established substantial numbers in Canada west of Ontario compared with larger denominations, meanwhile merged with Emmanuel College in Saskatoon and withdrew from tertiary education in Regina.

The upgrading process accelerated in 1961 when the college was granted full-degree-granting status as the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan and students completing degrees at Regina Campus were granted degrees of the University of Saskatchewan.

===Regina Campus===
The arts and sciences programs evolved with the growth of Regina Campus, which held its first convocation in 1965. The new campus was begun in 1966 on Wascana Lake, to the southeast of the old campus whose buildings, however, remain in use: the old Girls&#x27; Residence is now used by the Regina Conservatory of Music; the Normal School, having at various times housed not only the teacher-training facility that is now the university&#x27;s Department of Education but the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History, war-training facilities during World War II when it was temporarily resumed by the federal crown and latterly the university&#x27;s Fine Arts Department, is now the Canada-Saskatchewan Soundstage.

The original design of Regina Campus (as of Wascana Centre itself) and its initial buildings, in a stark concrete modernist style, were by Minoru Yamasaki, the architect of the original World Trade Center in New York.
;Yamasaki&#x27;s original vision: 
The Dr. John Archer Library, the main library of the university, was opened in 1967, one of the original three buildings of the new campus (the others being the classroom and laboratory buildings), and named after Dr. John Archer in 1999. Further building has been substantially in accord with Yamasaki&#x27;s vision, notwithstanding some controversy over the years as to the suitability of its austere style for the featureless Regina plain; by 1972 with the demolition of Yamasaki&#x27;s 1955 Pruitt–Igoe housing project in St. Louis, Missouri—such demolition being considered by some to be the beginning of postmodern architecture—Yamasaki&#x27;s modernist aesthetic was already somewhat passé in the view of many architects.
Campion College and later Luther College, which like Regina College had also been denominational junior colleges affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan, established &quot;federated college&quot; status on the model of Victoria, Trinity, St Michael&#x27;s and University Colleges at the University of Toronto (and ultimately the collegiate system of Oxford and Cambridge) and built facilities at the new campus. (St Chad&#x27;s, a fourth denominational college in Regina, operated by the Anglican Church of Canada on the former Anglican diocesan property on College Avenue immediately to the east of Regina College, merged with Emmanuel College on the Saskatoon campus in 1964 and, after a period of continuing to operate its private girls&#x27; high school closed its Regina facilities in 1970.)

In September 2000, the 600 City of Regina Wing of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association, erected a bronze war memorial plaque dedicated to the former personnel of No. 2 Initial Training School, who trained in the Conservatory of Music building during the Second World War.

===An independent University of Regina===

Because there was no follow-through regarding plans by the University of Saskatchewan to establish additional faculties at Regina (rather than the Saskatoon campus), the Faculty Council was formed to study the feasibility of creating an autonomous institution. A Royal Commission under a Supreme Court of Canada justice, Emmett Hall, found there to be &quot;two campus groups warring within the bosom of a single university.&quot;

As a result, the University of Regina was established as an independent institution on 1 July 1974 and the first University of Regina degrees were conferred at the spring convocation in 1975—although its development was slow until the 21st century, when a renewed burst of building and expansion occurred. That being said, several of the university&#x27;s faculties are significantly smaller in the 21st century than they were in the 1970s as priorities have shifted from liberal arts to vocational training.

The original Regina College buildings on College Avenue continue in use; the old Girls&#x27; Residence is now the Regina Conservatory of Music; in 1997 the Fine Arts Department moved from the old Normal School building to the new W.A. Riddell Centre and the Normal School was substantially renovated to become the Canada-Saskatchewan Soundstage.

The campus has experienced a recent spurt of growth and expansion, having been static for some two decades after the construction of the Language Institute at the end of the 1970s. Since the late 1990s, several new buildings have been added including the Dr. William A. Riddell Centre; the Wakpá Tower (South) and Paskwāw Tower (North) Residences; the Centre for Kinesiology, Health &amp; Sport; First Nations University of Canada and Research &amp; Innovation Centre; along with a significant expansion of the Education Building.

The building of the Wakpá Tower (South) and Paskwāw Tower (North) Residences also involved a significant redevelopment of the landscaping of the campus around a new oval as an aesthetic and community hub of campus. Future plans include construction on the east side of the Ring Road. The goal is to accommodate an enrolment of 25,000.

In the summer of 2005 the University of Regina hosted the 2005 Canada Games. Many events took place in the newly completed state-of-the-art Centre for Kinesiology, Health and Sport. The administration of the games proceeded from the University of Regina Students Union offices and various other locations.

The Regina Research Park is located immediately adjacent to the main campus and conducts many of its initiatives in conjunction with university departments. In recent years, local benefactors have substantially endowed the university with scholarships and chairs in various disciplines.

In 2015, The University of Regina opened La Cité universitaire francophone (La Cité) which is the first French University in Saskatchewan. The university offers French language classes for French students learning the language and the culture of la francophone and Fransaskois. It also offers La Rotonde which is a place to learn about French culture.

International enrolment at Saskatchewan post-secondary institutions more than doubled between 2014-15 and 2022-23. International students have spoken out saying Saskatchewan lacks the infrastructure to support the influx. The increase to 25% international of U of Regina&#x27;s student body has come with increased incidences of racism directed at U of Regina students. International student tuition and fees for a bachelor of science at U of Regina total $24,882/year, domestic students pay $8,877/year.

==Federated colleges, regional colleges and associates==

The university has three federated colleges:
* Campion College
* First Nations University of Canada
* Luther College
Campion and Luther colleges had been high schools offering junior college courses accredited by the University of Saskatchewan on the same basis as the old Regina College, out of premises located elsewhere in Regina. Campion College became a junior college of the University of Saskatchewan like Regina College in 1923, later severed that association in favour of one with St Boniface College in Manitoba, and returned to federated college status with the University of Saskatchewan in 1964. It built its facilities on the new Regina Campus in 1968 and subsequently vacated its original high school premises on 23rd Avenue. Its Regina Campus building was designed in accordance with Minoru Yamasaki&#x27;s original plan for the campus, with a &quot;podium,&quot; contemplated as eventually being joined with the campus-wide ground floor. Thus far this has not occurred and Campion&#x27;s building remains isolated.
Luther College opened its building on the new Regina Campus in 1971 but continues to operate its high school on Royal Street, on the site of the first Government House of the North-West Territories. By this point the original Yamasaki plan for the campus was being reconsidered and the Luther College complex is isolated to the east of the principal campus buildings, though it is connected by an all-weather corridor via Campion College.

The First Nations University of Canada grew out of the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College, established in 1976 and then housed in a building immediately west of College West. It was an original foundation at the University of Regina. Its new building to the east of Luther College replaced its original facilities to the west of College West and was opened by Prince Edward in 2003 and visited by the Queen in 2005 when she installed a commemorative stone to symbolise the special relationship between Canada&#x27;s First Nations and the sovereign.

The United Church, having vacated tertiary education in Regina when it ceded Regina College to the University of Saskatchewan, and the Anglican Church, having removed its St Chad&#x27;s College from Regina to Saskatoon, do not maintain any presence at the University of Regina. The Christian and Missionary Alliance Church formerly maintained the residential Canadian Bible College in Regina and offered some of its courses for accreditation with the University of Regina but was unable to obtain university status in Saskatchewan and vacated to Calgary in 2003.

Additionally, the University of Regina has two &quot;Affiliated Colleges:&quot; The Gabriel Dumont Institute and the Saskatchewan Polytechnic (formerly Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology, SIAST). The university also has two &quot;Associated Colleges:&quot; Athol Murray College of Notre Dame and Briercrest College and Seminary. These institutions offer collaborative, associated, or articulated programs in conjunction with the University of Regina.

Saskatchewan&#x27;s network of Regional Colleges further extend program delivery across the province. The University of Regina offers courses through Cumberland College, Northlands College, North West Regional College, Great Plains College, Carlton Trail Regional College, Parkland College, and the South East Regional College.

==Faculties==
The University of Regina has ten faculties and one school that offer a variety of programs at the certificate, diploma, undergraduate and graduate degree levels.
The University of Regina also has one graduate school, the Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy. It delivers Masters and Doctoral programs in conjunction with the University of Saskatchewan.

The University of Regina also offers a number of pre-professional transfer programs with other universities and professional colleges: Agriculture and Bioresources, Chiropractic, Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Nutrition, Occupational Therapy, Optometry, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, and Veterinary Medicine.

At the centre of a predominantly English speaking campus, La Cité universitaire francophone at the University of Regina offers a wide range of French programs, services and activities. La Cité directs and supports research projects related to francophones in minority situations, as well as unique university-community initiatives that contribute to the development of the Fransaskois community.

===Co-operative education===
The University of Regina is one of the universities with co-operative education in Saskatchewan. Many of the university undergraduate students are enrolled in the co-op program, with the highest percentage being in the faculties of science and engineering. The Faculty of Arts offers an innovative internship program for its undergraduate students.

==Residences==
 
Regina College originally housed male and female student residences which were converted to academic use when the college became affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan in 1934. (The old Girls&#x27; Residence now accommodates the Regina Conservatory of Music.)

The Main (Wascana) Campus has residence space for about 1,200 students on-campus. Each bedroom is single-occupant, but many spaces on campus are designed to facilitate double occupancy, increasing capacity if required to address high demand without building additional residence space. The University of Regina residences have enlivened campus life from the somewhat bleak atmosphere of its founding days:

*College West, the first on-campus residential accommodation, constructed in 1972. Offers apartment-style residence living. The building also houses classrooms, academic and business offices and the Bookstore, previously located first in the Classroom Building and then the Administration Humanities Building.
*La Résidence in the Language Institute, gives priority to francophone students and those studying international languages. Offers dorm-style residence living. It maintains a French-speaking student atmosphere.
*Wakpá Tower (South) and Paskwāw Tower (North) Residences, completed in 2004. Two symmetrical, twelve-floor towers housing apartment, studio, and dorm-style residences. These buildings form the centre pinnacle for the campus and also house both External/Alumni Relations and the Faculty of Graduate Studies &amp; Research.
*Kīšik Towers Residences, which opened in 2015. These twin 14-storey buildings offer two bedroom or four bedroom apartments, studio apartments and single dorms with private washrooms.
*Luther College Residences, part of Luther College (the university&#x27;s second federated college and second on-campus residence), opened in 1971. Luther offers more traditional dorm-style residences with some shared facilities.

The University of Regina internally designates a significant portion of spaces annually to incoming (first year) students in an effort to facilitate the growing number of non-resident (international, out-of-province, rural) students choosing to live on-campus.

==Sports==

The University of Regina is a member of U Sports and fields men and women&#x27;s teams in various sports. Its teams bear the name &quot;Cougars&quot; in all sports, except the Regina Rams, which were originally a community junior football team competing in PJFC football without affiliation with the university, and who joined University ranks in 1999 as a member of the Canada West Conference of U Sports. Men&#x27;s varsity teams include the Regina Rams (football), basketball, cross country, hockey, swimming, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. Women&#x27;s varsity teams include basketball, cross country, hockey, soccer, swimming, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. The University of Regina is also home to several varsity club teams, including cheerleading, curling, dance team, rowing, men&#x27;s rugby sevens, women&#x27;s rugby sevens, women&#x27;s softball, synchronized swimming, ultimate, and triathlon.

In the summer of 2005, the university hosted the Canada Summer Games.

==Media==
The university&#x27;s student newspaper is &quot;The Carillon&quot;. It for many years was an organ of radical student dissent and in the 1960s and 70s frequently had a very high community profile as its editorial postures occasioned vigorous denunciation by university administration figures and in the conservative general press. As student mores in subsequent generations have become less disputatious &quot;The Carillon&quot; has evolved into a less political paper which currently is a somewhat conventional newsletter of campus affairs.

The university is home to the School of Journalism, which was one of the first established in western Canada. The School publishes a student periodical, &quot;The Crow&quot;, and hosts the annual Minifie lecture, in honour of one of Canada&#x27;s most illustrious journalists, James M. Minifie (1900–1974).

The University of Regina does not have its own campus radio station, although the independent community radio station CJTR-FM actively solicits volunteers among the school&#x27;s student body.

The University of Regina is home to the Interactive Media and Performance Labs (IMP Labs), which includes programming for the student body as well as members of the community. The Labs have been particularly recognized through the IMP Labs Hip Hop Project with Scott Collegiate. The directors of this program, Dr. Charity Marsh and Chris Beingessner, received the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Arts Awards for Arts and Learning through the Saskatchewan Arts Board.

==Indigenous programs==
The University of Regina provides services to Indigenous people in more remote communities. The University of Regina&#x27;s SUNTEP program was developed in partnership with specific Indigenous communities to meet specific needs within Indigenous communities. Indigenous Elders are present on campus at University of Regina to provide social supports. Through the University of Regina&#x27;s Kâspohtamatâtân Mentorship Program Indigenous students act as role models to younger students still in their home communities. The University of Regina has established an Aboriginal Career Centre to assist with the transition to a fulfilling career.

<text>Conrad Grebel ( – 1526) was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement.

==Early life==
Conrad Grebel was born, probably in Grüningen in the canton of Zürich, about 1498 to Junker Jakob and Dorothea (Fries) Grebel, the second of six children. He spent his early life in Grüningen, and then came to Zürich with his family around 1513. He spent several years abroad in study, worked as a proofreader in Basel, married in 1522, and became a Christian minister around 1523.

==Education==
Conrad Grebel is thought to have studied for six years at the &quot;Carolina&quot;, the Latin school of the Grossmünster Church in Zürich. He enrolled at the University of Basel in October 1514. While there he studied under Heinrich Loriti, a noted humanist scholar. His father acquired a stipend from Emperor Maximilian for Conrad to study at the University of Vienna. In 1515 he began attending there and remained until 1518. While there, Grebel developed a close friendship with Joachim Vadian, an eminent Swiss humanist professor from St. Gall. After spending three years in Vienna he returned to Zürich for about three months. His father acquired a scholarship for Conrad from the King of France to attend the University in Paris. He spent two years in study there, and joined the boarding academy of his former teacher in Basel, Loriti. In Paris Grebel engaged in a loose lifestyle, and was involved in several brawls with other students. When Grebel&#x27;s father received word of his son&#x27;s demeanor, he cut off Conrad&#x27;s funds and demanded that he return to Zürich. Conrad Grebel spent about six years in three universities, but without finishing his education or receiving a degree.

In 1521 Grebel joined a group gathered to study with Huldrych Zwingli. With him they studied the Greek classics, the Latin Bible, the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. It was in this study group that Grebel met and developed a close friendship with Felix Manz.

==Ministry==
Conrad Grebel probably experienced a conversion in the spring of 1522. His life showed a dramatic change, and he became an earnest supporter of the preaching and reforms of Zwingli. He rose to leadership among Zwingli&#x27;s young and enthusiastic followers. This close following and enthusiastic support of Zwingli was challenged by the Second Disputation in Zürich in October 1523. Grebel and Zwingli broke over abolishing the Mass. Zwingli argued before the council for abolishing the Mass and removing images from the church. But when he saw that the city council was not ready for such radical changes, he chose not to break with the council, and even continued to officiate at the Mass until it was abolished in May 1525. Grebel saw this as an issue of obeying God rather than men, and, with others, could not conscientiously continue in that which they had condemned as unscriptural. These young radicals felt betrayed by Zwingli, while Zwingli looked on them as irresponsible.

About 15 men broke with Zwingli, and, while taking no specific action at that time, they regularly met together for prayer, fellowship and Bible study. During this time of waiting for direction from God, they sought religious connections outside of Zürich. Grebel wrote to both Andreas Karlstadt and Martin Luther in the summer of 1524, and to Thomas Müntzer in September. Karlstadt traveled to Zürich and met with them in October of that year. Despite apparent similarities, no connection between the Zürich radicals and Karlstadt ever came to fruition. In his letter to Müntzer, Grebel encouraged Müntzer in his opposition to Luther, but also reproached him for several errors he felt he was making. He urged Müntzer not to take up arms. The letter was returned to Grebel, having never reached Müntzer.

The final question to completely sever ties between the radicals and Zwingli was the question of infant baptism. A public debate was held on 17 January 1525. Zwingli argued against Grebel, Manz and George Blaurock. The city council decided in favor of Zwingli and infant baptism, ordered the Grebel group to cease their activities, and ordered that any unbaptized infants must be submitted for baptism within 8 days. Failure to comply with the council&#x27;s order would result in exile from the canton. Grebel had an infant daughter, Issabella, who had not been baptized, and he resolutely stood his ground. He did not intend for her to be baptized.

The group met together for counsel on 21 January in the home of Felix Manz. This meeting was illegal according to the new decision of the council. George Blaurock asked Grebel to baptize him upon a confession of faith. Afterward, Blaurock baptized the others who were present. As a group they pledged to hold the faith of the New Testament and live as fellow disciples separated from the world. They left the little gathering full of zeal to encourage all men to follow their example.

Being well known in Zürich, Grebel left the work to others and set out on an evangelistic mission to the surrounding cities. In February, Grebel baptized Wolfgang Ulimann by immersion in the Rhine River. Ulimann was in St. Gall, and Grebel traveled there in the spring. Conrad Grebel and Wolfgang Ulimann spent several months preaching with much success in the area of St. Gall. In the summer he went to Grüningen and preached with great effect. In October 1525 he was arrested and imprisoned. While in prison, Grebel was able to prepare a defense of the Anabaptist position on baptism. Through the help of some friends, he escaped in March 1526. He continued his ministry and was at some point able to get his pamphlet printed. Grebel removed to the Maienfeld area in the Canton of Grisons (where his oldest sister lived). Shortly after arrival he died there, probably around July or August.

==Works and significance==
The extant works of Conrad Grebel consist of 69 letters written by him from September 1517 to July 1525, three poems, a petition to the Zürich council, and portions of a pamphlet written by him against infant baptism, as quoted by Zwingli in his counterarguments. Three letters written to Grebel (Benedikt Burgauer, 1523; Vadian, 1524; and Erhard Hegenwalt, 1525) have been preserved. The majority of the 69 letters written by Grebel are from his student years, however, and shed little light on his ministry as an Anabaptist.

Though his entire life was less than 30 years, his Christian ministry was compressed into less than four years, and his time as an Anabaptist was only about a year and a half, Conrad Grebel&#x27;s impact earned him the title &quot;the Father of Anabaptists&quot;. Grebel performed the first known adult baptism associated with the Reformation, and was referred to as the &quot;ringleader&quot; of the Anabaptists in Zürich. Zwingli complained of no major differences with Grebel on cardinal points of theology, and minimized Grebel&#x27;s differences as &quot;unimportant outward things, such as these, whether infants or adults should be baptized and whether a Christian may be a magistrate.&quot; Yet these differences reveal a deep division of thought on the nature of the church, and the relationship of the church and the Christian to the world. The beliefs of Conrad Grebel and the Swiss Brethren have left an impression on the life and thought of Amish, Baptist, Schwarzenau Brethren/German Baptist, and Mennonite churches, as well as numerous pietistic and free church movements. The Bruderhof Communities, founded in 1920, draw inspiration from the beliefs and actions of Conrad Grebel and the other reformation era Anabaptists. Where others only longed for restitution or shrank from too much reform, Grebel and his group acted decisively and at great personal risk. Freedom of conscience and separation of church and state are two great legacies of the Anabaptist movement initiated by these Swiss Brethren.

With Petr Chelčický (1390–1460) of Bohemia, Conrad Grebel is considered one of the first nonresistant Christians of the Reformation.

In 1961 a Mennonite University College was named after him in Waterloo, Ontario.

==Family==
The Grebels had been a prominent Swiss family for over a century before Conrad&#x27;s birth. His father Jakob was an iron merchant and served as a magistrate in Grüningen from 1499 to 1512. After that he served as a representative on the council of the Canton of Zürich, and was also frequently called upon as an ambassador for Zürich to meetings of the Swiss Confederation. Jakob Grebel disagreed with his son&#x27;s religious sentiments, but he also thought Zwingli&#x27;s measures against the Anabaptists were too harsh. Jakob Grebel was executed in Zürich on 30 October 1526, having been convicted of receiving illegal funds from foreign rulers. Some scholars consider his opposition to the measures of Zwingli as a likely reason behind the execution.

Against his family&#x27;s wishes, Conrad Grebel married Barbara on 6 February 1522. Children were born to this union, and relatives raised the children after the death of Conrad. Ironically, the children were raised in the Reformed faith, and the family name once again became prominent in Zürich. His grandson, also named Conrad, was the city&#x27;s treasurer in 1624, and a later descendant also named Conrad Grebel was burgomaster in 1669. Even in recent times, Grebel descendants have served the courts and parishes of Zürich.

==Legacy==
In 1961 a Mennonite University College, Conrad Grebel University College, was named after him in Waterloo, Ontario.

<doc id="434161" wikidata="Q1344173" url="?curid=434161" title="Nephelinite">
<text>Nephelinite is a fine-grained or aphanitic igneous rock made up almost entirely of nepheline and clinopyroxene (variety augite). If olivine is present, the rock may be classified as an olivine nephelinite. Nephelinite is dark in color and may resemble basalt in hand specimen. However, basalt consists mostly of clinopyroxene (augite) and calcic plagioclase.

Basalt, alkali basalt, basanite, tephritic nephelinite, and nephelinite differ partly in the relative proportions of plagioclase and nepheline. Alkali basalt may contain minor nepheline and does contain nepheline in its CIPW normative mineralogy. A critical ratio in the classification of these rocks is the ratio nepheline/(nepheline plus plagioclase). Basanite has a value of this ratio between 0.1 and 0.6 and also contains more than 10% olivine. Tephritic nephelinite has a value between 0.6 and 0.9. Nephelinite has a value greater than 0.9. Le Maitre (2002) defines and discusses these and other criteria in the classification of igneous rocks.

Nephelinite is an example of a silica-undersaturated igneous rock. The degree of silica saturation can be evaluated with normative mineralogy calculated from chemical analyses, or with actual mineralogy for completely crystallized igneous rocks with equilibrated assemblages. Silica-oversaturated rocks contain quartz (or another silica polymorph). Silica-undersaturated mafic igneous rocks contain magnesian olivine but not magnesian orthopyroxene, and/or a feldspathoid. Silica-saturated igneous rocks fall in between these two classes.

Silica-undersaturated, mafic igneous rocks are much less abundant than silica-saturated and oversaturated basalts. Genesis of the less common mafic rocks such as nephelinite is usually ascribed to more than one of the following three causes:
* relatively high pressure of melting;
* relatively low degree of fractional melting in a mantle source;
* relatively high dissolved carbon dioxide in the melt.
Nephelinites and similar rocks typically contain relatively high concentrations of elements such as the light rare earths, as consistent with a low degree of melting of mantle peridotite at depths sufficient to stabilize garnet. Nephelinites are also associated with carbonatite in some occurrences, consistent with source rocks relatively rich in carbon dioxide.

Nephelinite is found on ocean islands such as Oʻahu, although the rock type is very rare in the Hawaiian Islands. It is found in a variety of continental settings. An example is the Hamada nephelinite lava flow in southwest Japan which occurred in the late Miocene age. Nephelinite is also associated with the highly alkalic volcanism of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcanic field in Tanzania. Nyiragongo, another African volcano known for its semipermanent lava lake activity, erupts lava made of melilite nephelinite. The unusual chemical makeup of this igneous rock may be a factor in the unusual fluidity of its lavas.
Olivine nephelinite flows also occur in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field in east-central British Columbia and at Volcano Mountain in central Yukon Territory. Melilite olivine nephelinite intrusives of Cretaceous age are found in the area around Uvalde, Texas.

<doc id="434162" wikidata="Q311529" url="?curid=434162" title="Elton Mayo">
<text>George Elton Mayo (26 December 1880 – 7 September 1949) was an Australian born psychologist, industrial researcher, and organizational theorist. Mayo was formally trained at the University of Adelaide, acquiring a Bachelor of Arts Degree graduating with First Class Honours, majoring in philosophy and psychology, and was later awarded an honorary Master of Arts Degree from the University of Queensland (UQ).

While in Queensland, Mayo served on the University&#x27;s war committee and pioneered research into the psychoanalytic treatment of shell-shock. As a psychologist Mayo often helped soldiers returning from World War I recover from the stresses of war and with a Brisbane physician, pioneered the psychoanalytic treatment of shell-shock and conducted psycho-pathological tests. He was a lecturer in psychology and mental philosophy at the UQ between 1911 and 1922, when he sailed to the United States. In 1926 he was appointed to the Harvard Business School (HBS) as a professor of industrial research.

In Philadelphia he conducted research at a textile plant in order to develop a method to reduce the very high rate of turnover in the plant. Mayo&#x27;s association with the Hawthorne studies as well as his research and work in Australia led to his enjoying a public acclaim granted to few social scientists of his day.

Mayo has been credited with making significant contributions to a number of disciplines, including business management, industrial sociology, philosophy, and social psychology. His field research in industry had a significant impact on industrial and organizational psychology. According to Trahair, Mayo &quot;is known for having established the scientific study of what today is called organizational behavior when he gave close attention to the human, social, and political problems of industrial civilization.&quot; (p. 15).

Mayo&#x27;s work helped to lay the foundation for the human relations movement. He emphasized that alongside the formal organization of an industrial workplace there exists an informal organizational structure as well. Mayo recognized the &quot;inadequacies of existing scientific management approaches&quot; to industrial organizations, and underlined the importance of relationships among people who work for such organizations. His ideas on group relations were advanced in his 1933 book &quot;The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization&quot;, which was based partly on his Hawthorne research.

==Early life and education==
Mayo was the eldest son of George Gibbes Mayo, a draftsman and later a civil engineer, and his wife, Henrietta Mary Mayo (née Donaldson). His grandfather George Mayo (1807–1894) was a well-known South Australian medical practitioner. Elton attended several schools in Australia (Queen&#x27;s School, St Peter&#x27;s College, and the University of Adelaide) and after 1901 attended medical school of University of Edinburgh and in London, neither of which he completed. In 1903 he went to West Africa, and upon returning to London, began writing articles for magazines and teaching English at the Working Men&#x27;s College. He returned to Adelaide in 1905 to a partnership in the printing firm of J. H. Sherring &amp; Co., but in 1907 he went back to the university to study philosophy and psychology under William Mitchell. He won the Roby Fletcher prize in psychology and graduated with honours (B.A., 1910; M.A., 1926) and was named the David Murray research scholar in scientific studies. In 1911 he became foundation lecturer in mental and moral philosophy at the new University of Queensland and in 1919–23 held the first chair of philosophy there. He moved on to the University of Pennsylvania, but spent the second half of his career at Harvard Business School (1926–1947), where he was professor of industrial research.

Two influences on his career from his time at the University of Queensland were Mayo&#x27;s friendship with the social anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski and his work with shell-shock cases returning from the First World War. Malinowski first met Mayo on his way to and from the Trobriand Islands; they became close friends and were regularly in touch until Malinowski&#x27;s death in 1942. The work with shell-shock soldiers provided a focus for Mayo&#x27;s interests in clinical psychology and developed his skills in psychotherapy. In this he was strongly influenced by the work on hysteria and obsession of the French psychiatrist, Pierre Janet, who became a critic of Sigmund Freud. For the rest of his working life, Mayo was an active psychotherapist and this practical experience was an important influence on his theoretical and methodological work in America.

One of Mayo&#x27;s (1924) earliest research efforts involved workers at a Philadelphia textile mill. The mill had been experiencing a high rate of turnover. Mayo believed that the repetitive work in the spinning department gave rise to mental abnormalities in the workers. He found that the introduction of rest periods helped reduce turnover. The research helped make Mayo more widely known in the U.S.

Mayo helped to lay the foundation for the human relations movement, and was known for his industrial research including the Hawthorne Studies and his book &quot;The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization&quot; (1933). The research he conducted under the rubric of the Hawthorne Studies in the late 1920s and early 1930s, underlining the importance of groups in affecting the behaviour of individuals at work.

Elton Mayo laid the &quot;ground rules for interviewing&quot;, the principles of which have been subsequently repeated in numerous &#x27;how to&#x27; books on leadership, coaching and mentoring over the last half century.

===Hawthorne studies===
Fritz J. Roethlisberger, Mayo&#x27;s graduate assistant, and William J. Dickson, head of the Department of Employee Relations at Western Electric, conducted the bulk of the practical research, with Mayo rarely visiting the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois. Mayo&#x27;s team carried out a number of &quot;experiments&quot; to look at ways of improving productivity. The research involved manipulating length of rest and lunch periods and piecework payment plans. Mayo concluded that productivity partly depended on the informal social patterns of interaction in the work group.

Mayo, in communicating to business leaders, advanced the idea that managers who understand the nature of informal ties among workers can make decisions for management&#x27;s benefit. Mayo concluded that people&#x27;s work performance is dependent on both social relationships and job content. He suggested a tension between workers&#x27; &quot;logic of sentiment&quot; and managers&#x27; &quot;logic of cost and efficiency&quot; which could lead to conflict within organizations.

Parsons, however, showed that the Hawthorne studies, which were not really experiments, were too confounded to enable researchers to draw firm conclusions. The Hawthorne effect was later named for the phenomenon where people change their behavior when they are aware that they are being observed.

The qualitative aspects of the research suggested that norms of co-operation among workers were related to productivity.

===&quot;The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization&quot;===

The books begins with an account of the research on human fatigue and efficiency conducted in the early 20th century.

==Mayo&#x27;s credentials==
Although biographers agree about Mayo&#x27;s contributions, there is no consensus about his credentials. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, biographical dictionaries, and some published texts indicate that Mayo was a psychologist. Some authors and critics have discussed Mayo&#x27;s credentials and his various other job titles during his career in the United States. Cullen does not mention that Mayo was a psychologist although Cullen noted that Mayo let interlocutors call him &quot;Dr. Mayo,&quot; letting himself be cast as a Ph.D. in one of the social sciences, without correcting the mistake. Mayo&#x27;s biographer Trahair wrote, &quot;Mayo was not a psychologist, sociologist, or anthropologist, although sometimes he was cast as such&quot; (p. 357). Trahair also wrote that &quot;after the great war Mayo&#x27;s reputation grew as a successful academic, clinical psychologist and public speaker&quot; (p. 89). Of course having a reputation as a clinical psychologist does not necessarily make one a clinical psychologist (the public often thinks of psychotherapists, regardless of training, as clinical psychologists or even psychiatrists).

Cullen indicated that Mayo was not a medical doctor, writing that in April 1903, Mayo &quot;enrolled at a small medical school at Saint George&#x27;s Hospital at London...At this point, Mayo&#x27;s interest in medicine was all but non-existent&quot; (p. 28). Having dropped out by December 1903, Mayo &quot;wrote home and finally revealed to his family the truth; he did not and could not become a doctor&quot; (p. 28). Miner wrote: &quot;An effective speaker and proficient in cultivating influential friends and mentors, he nevertheless had little by way of academic credentials and practically no training in the conduct of scientific research&quot; (p. 60).

==Criticisms==
Mayo&#x27;s contributions to management theory were criticised by intellectual Daniel Bell. Writing in 1947, Bell criticised Mayo and other social scientists for &quot;adjusting men to machines,&quot; rather than enlarging human capacity or human freedom. Many, including Reinhard Bendix and Lloyd H. Fisher, criticized Mayo for generalizing his results of the Hawthorne studies. The two state that Mayo&#x27;s research concerned small, isolated groups, and it was not clear that the conditions and supervision he achieved could have been replicated in large groups and factory settings. His theories are also based upon the assumption that humans, by nature, want to cooperate and form groups, and he never allows for the possibility of José Ortega y Gasset&#x27;s idea of &quot;the stranger,&quot; built upon the proposition that humans, by nature, are suspicious of others. More recently, in 2003, James Hoopes criticised Mayo for &quot;substituting therapy for democracy.&quot; Re-analyses of the original Hawthorne data indicate that the quality of the research was poor.

==Family==
Elton Mayo married Dorothea McConnel on 18 April 1913. Dorothea was the eldest daughter of James Henry McConnel ( 1850 – 7 June 1914) of Cressbrook Station, Queensland and the sister of Ursula McConnel.
They had two daughters:
*Patricia Elton Mayo married Dunstan Curtis. She was a sociologist, author of &quot;The Making of a Criminal&quot; (1970) and &quot;Roots of Identity&quot;
*Gael Elton Mayo, better known as Ruth Elton Mayo (1923–1992), British artist and novelist.

The medical doctor Helen Mayo (1878–1967) was his sister, and the Supreme Court judge Sir Herbert Mayo (1885–1972) was his brother.

<text>The Rose Cross (also called Rose Croix and Rosy Cross) is a symbol largely associated with the legendary Christian Rosenkreuz, a Christian Kabbalist and alchemist said to have been the founder of the Rosicrucian Order. The Rose Cross is a cross with a rose at its centre, which is usually red, golden, or white. It symbolizes the teachings of a Western esoteric tradition with Christian tenets.

As a key Rosicrucian symbol, the Rosy Cross was also used by the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross (1750s–1790s), and is still used by the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (1865–present).

==Symbolism==

The Rosicrucian manifestos were written during the Protestant Reformation in Germany, and have an underlying theme of reform. In 1520, Martin Luther had a seal made with a five-petaled white rose encapsulating a heart, with a simple cross in the centre. Johannes Valentinus Andreae, a likely candidate for the authorship of the third Rosicrucian manifesto, the &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;, came from a family whose crest featured an X-shaped cross with roses in the four corners.

Many allegorical and esoteric explanations for the Rose Cross have arisen over the centuries. Some groups, such as the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, purport that the rosy cross predates Christianity, where &quot;the cross represents the human body and the rose represents the individual&#x27;s unfolding consciousness.

It has also been suggested that the rose represents silence while the cross signifies &quot;salvation, to which the Society of the Rose-Cross devoted itself by teaching mankind the love of God and the beauty of brotherhood, with all that they implied.&quot;
Others saw the Rosy Cross as a symbol of the human process of reproduction elevated to the spiritual:
: &quot;The fundamental symbols of the Rosicrucians were the rose and the cross; the rose female and the cross male, both universal phallic ... As generation is the key to material existence, it is natural that the Rosicrucians should adopt as its characteristic symbols those exemplifying the reproductive processes. As regeneration is the key to spiritual existence, they therefore founded their symbolism upon the rose and the cross, which typify the redemption of man through the union of his lower temporal nature with his higher eternal nature.&quot;

It is further a symbol of the philosopher&#x27;s stone, the ultimate product of alchemy.

==Rosicrucianism==

The Rosicrucian manifestos tell an allegorical story of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood, founded in the early 14th century, or between the 13th and 14th centuries,
as an invisible college of mystic sages, by a sage having the symbolic name of Christian Rosenkreuz in order
: &quot;to prepare a new phase of the Christian religion to be used during the coming age now at hand, for as the world and man evolve so also must religion change.&quot;

Paracelsus, who was called the &quot;Luther of Medicine&quot;,
describes these mystics sages as
: &quot;persons who have been exalted [&quot;verzueckt&quot;] to God, and who have remained in that state of exaltation, and have not died ... nobody knew what became of them, and yet they remained on the earth.&quot;

Some modern Rosicrucian groups suggest that the Rosicrucian Order has been active since the beginning of the Renaissance period, not only as an hermetic Order, but also through forerunners – geniuses of the western world, sometimes known to also be Freemasons – in the literary, cultural, ethical, political, religious and scientific fields.

In the late 18th century, von Eckartshausen, a German Christian mystic, described the true Adepts of the Rose Cross in the following terms:
: &quot;These sages, whose number is small, are children of light, and are opposed to darkness. They dislike mystification and secrecy; they are open and frank, have nothing to do with secret societies and with external ceremonies. They possess a spiritual temple, in which God is presiding.&quot;
Later, in the early 20th century, Max Heindel, a Rosicrucian Initiate, believed that the roots of the Brothers of the Rose Cross, immersed in the Western mystery tradition, are almost impossible to trace as
: &quot;theirs is a work which aims to encourage the evolution of humanity, they have labored far back into antiquity—under one guise or another.&quot;

==Initiatory groups==

The &quot;Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreutz&quot;, also known as the Fraternity of the Golden and Rosy Cross, was founded in the 1750s and is believed to be the first Rosicrucian order which existed outside of allegory. Their ten-grade system went on to influence Masonic and Hermetic initiatory groups, such as the SRIA.

===Freemasonry===
Connections between Freemasonry and Rose Cross exist from times preceding the formation of the original Grand Lodge (landmarks of Andersen, in 1717). The Rosy Cross is also a symbol found in some Masonic Christian bodies
and employed by individuals and groups formed during the last centuries for the study of Rosicrucianism and allied subjects,
but derived from the adoption of a red rose.

The Masonic Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia was founded in England in 1865 and uses the same grade system as the Gold und Rosenkreutz. The English group has since inspired other Masonic and initiatory Societas Rosicruciana organizations internationally.

Within the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite concordant body of Freemasonry, the Eighteenth Degree is specifically concerned with the rose cross and confers the title of &quot;Knight Rose Croix&quot;. Of one version of the degree, Albert Pike wrote in 1871,
: The Degree of Rose Cross teaches three things — the unity, immutability and goodness of God; the immortality of the Soul; and the ultimate defeat and extinction of evil and wrong and sorrow, by a Redeemer or Messiah, yet to come, if he has not already appeared.

Thomas De Quincey suggested that Freemasonry was possibly an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism.

===Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn===

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was founded by three members of the SRIA, and made use of the rosy cross as well, including &quot;The Ritual of the Rose Cross&quot;, designed for spiritual protection and as preparation for meditation. Based on the Rosicrucian symbolism of the red rose and the cross of gold, it is also a key symbol of the Golden Dawn&#x27;s second order.

According to Israel Regardie, the Golden Dawn&#x27;s rosy cross contains attributes for the classical elements, classical planets, zodiac, Hebrew alphabet, alchemical principles, the hexagram and pentagram, the sefirot of the Tree of Life, and the formula of INRI. On the back side of the rosy cross is inscribed the motto of the Zelator Adeptus minor at the bottom, &quot;The master Jesus Christ, God and Man&quot; between four Maltese crosses, and in the center, written in Latin, &quot;Blessed be the Lord our God who hath given us the Symbol Signum.&quot;
Regardie says of the rosy cross in &quot;The Golden Dawn&quot;:

: The Rose-Cross is a &quot;lamen&quot; or badge synthesizing a vast concourse of ideas, representing in a single emblem the great work itself – the harmonious reconciliation in one symbol of diverse and apparently contradictory concepts, the reconciliation of divinity and manhood. It is a highly important symbol to be worn over the heart during every important operation. It is a glyph, in one sense, of the higher Genius to whose knowledge and conversation the student is eternally aspiring. In the rituals it is described as the &quot;Key of Sigils and Rituals&quot;.

This &quot;lamen&quot; is a complete synthesis of the masculine, positive, or rainbow scale of color attributions, which is also called the &quot;Scale of the King&quot;. The four arms of the cross belong to the four elements and are colored accordingly. The white portion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the planets.

The petals of the rose refer to the twenty-two paths on the Tree of Life and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It is the cross in Tiphareth, the receptacle and the center of the forces of the &quot;sephiroth&quot; and the paths. The extreme center of the rose is white, the reflected spiritual brightness of &quot;kether&quot;, bearing upon it the red rose of five petals and the golden cross of six squares: Four green rays issue from around the angles of the cross. Upon the white portion of the &quot;lamen&quot;, below the rose, is placed the hexagram, with the planets.

Around the pentagrams, which are placed one upon each elemental colored arm, are drawn the symbols of the spirit and the four elements. Upon each of the floriated (the arms) of the cross are arranged the three alchemical principles of sulfur, salt, and mercury. The white rays issuing from behind the rose at the inner angles between the arms of the cross are the rays of the divine light issuing and coruscating from the reflected light of &quot;kether&quot; in its center; and the letters and symbols on them refer to the analysis of the key word: I.N.R.I.

==Thelema==
The symbol of the rosy cross played a substantial role within the system of Thelema as developed by Aleister Crowley. In a cosmological context, the rose is Nuit, the infinitely expanded goddess of the night sky, and the cross is Hadit, the ultimately contracted atomic point. For Crowley, it was the job of the adept to identify with the appropriate symbol so to experience the mystical conjunction of opposites, which leads to attainment. In this sense, the rose cross is a grand symbol of the Great Work:

Crowley also believed that this process is reflected in the sexual act:

The rosy cross is further symbolic of the grade of Adeptus Minor in the A∴A∴, the Qabalistic sphere of Tiphareth on the Tree of Life, the magical formula INRI, and the concepts of Light (LVX) and Life.

===Ordo Templi Orientis===

The rose cross also has a place in the system of Ordo Templi Orientis. It is associated with the Fifth Degree, the title of which is &quot;Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix, and Knight of the Pelican and Eagle.&quot; Of it, Crowley writes in &quot;An Intimation with Reference to the Constitution of the Order&quot;:

==Fellowship of the Rosy Cross==

The Fellowship of the Rosy Cross is a Christian mystical organization in England established in 1915 by A.E. Waite. It developed after the end of Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn. Waite made its rites to reflect his interest in the history of the Rosicrucian Order, Freemasonry, and Christian mystical teachings through the ages. Most of its members were also Freemasons or theosophists. One of its most noted members was the novelist Ch. Williams who was a member from 1917 to at least 1928 and possibly later.
There were plans to establish a branch in the United States, but they appear never to have been fulfilled. The order is still extant in England today. represents the brotherhood as a Christian order that dates from the Middle Ages.

==Modern forms==
One modern form of the &quot;Rosie Cross&quot; is found in a Rosicrucian Christian symbol that places a crown of red roses ennobling a white rose at the centre of the cross; radiating behind is the golden five-pointed star, an allusion also to &#x27;the Five Points of Fellowship&#x27;.
It is the symbol of the fraternity that has prepared a great lodge (Mount Ecclesia) for the brethren to be gathered.

The Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) is the largest Rosicrucian group today, extending worldwide through twenty-three grand lodges or jurisdictions.
The AMORC uses two main versions of the symbol: One is a gold Latin cross with a rose at its center. The other is a downward pointing triangle with a Greek (equilateral) cross inscribed within the triangle and a top oval reminiscent of an Egyptian Ankh. In both cases the symbolism suggests that
: &quot;together, the rose and cross represent the experiences and challenges of a thoughtful life well-lived.&quot;

In addition, the gold Latin cross version is interpreted as a person with arms outstretched in worship, and the rose at its center as the unfolding of the human soul over many lifetimes of work.

<doc id="434167" wikidata="Q1281844" url="?curid=434167" title="Nepheline syenite">
<text>Nepheline syenite is a holocrystalline plutonic rock that consists largely of nepheline and alkali feldspar. The rocks are mostly pale colored, grey or pink, and in general appearance they are not unlike granites, but dark green varieties are also known. Phonolite is the fine-grained extrusive equivalent.

==Petrology==
Nepheline syenites are silica-undersaturated and some are peralkaline (terms discussed in igneous rock). Nepheline is a feldspathoid, a solid-solution mineral, that does not coexist with quartz; rather, nepheline would react with quartz to produce alkali feldspar.

They are distinguished from syenites not only by the presence of nepheline but also by the occurrence of many other minerals rich in alkalis and in rare earths and other incompatible elements. In nepheline syenites, alkali feldspar dominates, commonly represented by orthoclase and the exsolved lamellar albite, form perthite. In some rocks the potash feldspar, in others the soda feldspar predominates. Fresh clear microcline is very characteristic of some types of nepheline syenite.

Sodalite, colorless and transparent in thin section, but frequently pale blue in the hand specimens, is the principal feldspathoid mineral in addition to nepheline. Reddish-brown to black aenigmatite occurs also in these rocks. Extremely iron-rich olivine is rare, but is present in some nepheline syenite. Other minerals common in minor amounts include sodium-rich pyroxene, biotite, titanite, iron oxides, apatite, fluorite, melanite garnet, and zircon. Cancrinite occurs in several nepheline-syenites. A great number of interesting and rare minerals have been recorded from nepheline syenites and the pegmatite veins which intersect them.

==Macroscopic aspects==
Macroscopic aspects of nepheline syenite are similar to those of granite. The presence of nepheline and absence of quartz are the fundamental difference. Biotite is generally of low content and the main mafic minerals are clinopyroxene (±) and amphibole (±). The macroscopic colour is grey, being little darker than granite. There is high-grade metamorphic rock originated from nepheline syenite that is characterized by gneiss texture of very rare occurrence. It is called nepheline syenite gneiss or litchfieldite. An example is found at Canaã village, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

==Texture==
The rock is holocrystalline, generally equigranular, equidirectional, and gross with grain size of 2 mm to 5 mm. In certain rare cases, the rock contains alkaline feldspar phenocrysts of 2 cm to 5 cm in length and 5 mm to 2 cm in thickness. The phenocrysts demonstrate orientation and eventually show cumulative texture.

==Mineral composition==
The main minerals are alkali feldspar, nepheline, clinopyroxene (±), amphibole (±), and biotite (±). Nepheline is the main feldspathoid. Quartz and orthopyroxene are absent. According to the IUGS classification nomenclature (International Union of Geological Sciences, Streckeisen, 1978), nepheline syenite has 10% &lt; &quot;F&quot;/(&quot;F&quot; + &quot;A&quot; + &quot;P&quot;) &lt; 60% and &quot;P&quot;/(&quot;A&quot; + &quot;P&quot;) &lt; 10% (where &quot;F&quot; – feldspathoids, &quot;A&quot; – alkali feldspar, and &quot;P&quot; – plagioclase volume fractions). Phonolite is the fine-grained equivalent. In case nepheline is less than 10%, the rock is called alkaline syenite with nepheline or pulaskite. The similar rock without quartz and nepheline is denominated alkaline syenite or syenite. Because of the presence of feldspathoids, nepheline syenite is classified to be a typical alkaline rock.

The alkaline feldspar is not potassic, but generally sodic-potassic, which is characterized by interlocking anorthoclase, called perthite. In the alkali feldspar almost pure albite domains are observed. Nepheline generally shows partial alteration into natrolite and cancrinite. The clinopyroxene is sodic whose composition varies from hedenbergite to aegirine-augite. This mineral eventually presents resorption shape. The reaction rim constituted by amphibole and/or biotite is commonly observed. The amphibole is of high alkali, such as alkaline hornblende and riebeckite. The alkaline clinopyroxene and amphibole are characteristics of typical alkaline rocks. Biotite is annite, with high Fe/Mg ratio.

The accessory minerals are magnetite, ilmenite, apatite, and titanite. Eventually, sodalite is found along hydrothermal fractures. Different from granite, zircon is rare and, if present, it is as xenocrysts. On the other hand, nepheline syenite gneiss contains abundant and large zircon crystals.

==Genesis==
Silica-undersaturated igneous rocks typically are formed by low degrees of partial melting in the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Carbon dioxide may dominate over water in source regions. Magmas of such rocks are formed in a variety of environments, including continental rifts, ocean islands, and supra-subduction positions in subduction zones. Nepheline syenite and phonolite may be derived by crystal fractionation from more mafic silica-undersaturated mantle-derived melts, or as partial melts of such rocks. Igneous rocks with nepheline in their normative mineralogy commonly are associated with other unusual igneous rocks such as carbonatite.

==Distribution==
Nepheline syenites and phonolites occur, for example, in Brazil, Canada, Cameroon, China, Greenland, Italy, Norway, the Pyrenees, Sweden, the Transvaal region, the Ural Mountains, in the USA Magnet Cove igneous complex of Arkansas, the mountains of the Central Montana Alkali Province, and as well as on oceanic islands.

Phonolite lavas formed in the East African rift in particularly large quantity, and the volume there may exceed the volume of all other phonolite occurrences combined, as discussed by Barker (1983).

Nepheline-normative rocks occur in close association with the Bushveld Igneous Complex, possibly formed from partial melting of the wall rocks to that large ultramafic layered intrusion.

Nepheline syenites are rare; there is only one occurrence in Great Britain (Loch Borralan) and one in France and Portugal. They are known also in Bohemia and in several places in Norway, Sweden and Finland. In the Americas these rocks have been found in Texas, Arkansas, New Jersey (Beemerville Complex) and Massachusetts, also in Ontario, British Columbia and Brazil. South Africa, Madagascar, India, Tasmania, Timor and Turkestan are other localities for the rocks of this series.

Rocks of this class also occur in Brazil (Serra de Tingua) containing sodalite and often much augite, in the western Sahara and Cape Verde Islands; also at Zwarte Koppies in the Transvaal, Madagascar, São Paulo in Brazil, Paisano Pass in West Texas, United States, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The rock of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, is a mica-foyaite rich in albite and aegirine: it accompanies granite and essexite. Litchfieldite is another well-marked type of nepheline-syenite, in which albite is the dominant feldspar. It is named after Litchfield, Maine, United States, where it occurs in scattered blocks. Biotite, cancrinite and sodalite are characteristic of this rock. A similar nepheline-syenite is known from Hastings County, Ontario, and contains hardly any orthoclase, but only albite feldspar. Nepheline is very abundant and there is also cancrinite, sodalite, scapolite, calcite, biotite and hornblende. The lujaurites are distinguished from the rocks above described by their dark color, which is due to the abundance of minerals such as augite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and other kinds of amphibole. Typical examples are known near Lujaur on the White Sea, where they occur with umptekites and other very peculiar rocks. Other localities for this group are at Julianehaab in Greenland with sodalite-syenite; at their margins they contain pseudomorphs after leucite. The lujaurites frequently have a parallel-banding or gneissose structure. Sodalite-syenites in which sodalite very largely or completely takes the place of nepheline occur in Greenland, where they contain also microcline-perthite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and eudialyte.

Cancrinite syenite, with a large percentage of cancrinite, has been described from Dalekarlia, Sweden and from Finland. Urtite from Lujaur Urt on the White Sea consists very largely of nepheline, with aegirine and apatite, but no feldspar. Jacupirangite (from Jacupiranga in Brazil) is a blackish rock composed of titaniferous augite, magnetite, ilmenite, perofskite and nepheline, with secondary biotite.

==Nomenclature==
There is a wide variety of silica-undersaturated and peralkaline igneous rocks, including many informal place-name varieties named after the locations in which they were first discovered. In many cases these are plain nepheline syenites containing one or more rare minerals or mineraloids, which do not warrant a new formal classification. These include;

&quot;Foyaite&quot;: foyaites are named after Foya in the Serra de Monchique, in southern Portugal. These are K-feldspar-nepheline syenites containing &lt;10% ferromagnesian minerals, usually pyroxene, hornblende and biotite.

&quot;Laurdalite&quot;: The laurdalites, from Laurdal in Norway, are grey or pinkish, and in many ways closely resemble the larvikites of southern Norway, with which they occur. They contain anorthoclase feldspars, biotite or greenish augite, much apatite and in some cases, olivine.

&quot;Ditroite&quot;: Ditroite derives its name from Ditrau, Transylvania, Romania. It is essentially a microcline, sodalite and cancrinite variety of nepheline syenite. It contains also orthoclase, nepheline, biotite, aegirine, acmite.

==Chemical composition==
The chemical peculiarities of the nepheline-syenites are well marked. They are exceedingly rich in alkalis and in alumina (hence the abundance of felspathoids and alkali feldspars), with silica varying from 50 to 56%, while lime, magnesia and iron are never present in great quantity, though somewhat more variable than the other components. A worldwide average of the major elements in nepheline syenite tabulated by Barker (1983) is listed below, expressed as weight percent oxides.

Nepheline syenite is characterized by high ratio of (Na2O+K2O)/SiO2 and (Na2O+K2O)/Al2O3, which are represented respectively by the existence of nepheline and alkaline mafic minerals. Therefore, it is classified geochemically as alkaline rock. This rock has low Fe and Mg contents, in total about 3wt%, and in this sense it is classified to be felsic rock. However, the SiO2 content is not so high, being 53% to 62wt%, which is equivalent to andesite and diorite. In this sense, it corresponds to intermediate rock. Light rare-earth elements are highly concentrated, indicating that the magma is highly differentiated.

* SiO2: 54.99%
* TiO2: 0.60%
* Al2O3: 20.96%
* Fe2O3: 2.25%
* FeO: 2.05%
* MnO: 0.15%
* MgO: 0.77%
* CaO: 2.31%
* Na2O: 8.23%
* K2O: 5.58%
* H2O: 1.47%
* P2O5: 0.13%

The normative mineralogy of this average composition contains about 22% nepheline and 66% feldspar.

Because nepheline syenite lacks quartz and is rich in feldspar and nepheline, it is used in the manufacturing of glass and ceramics.

==Applications==
Industrial use of nepheline syenite includes refractories, glass making, ceramics and, in pigments and fillers. In these applications the nepheline syenite is ground and dark minerals are carefully separated leaving a mixture of primarily feldspar and nepheline. This mixture is higher in alkali and aluminium and typically lower in iron and silica than feldspars from pegmatites making it a good raw material. In 1994 production of nepheline syenite in Canada and Norway, the largest producing countries, was 600,000 tonnes and 330,000 tonnes respectively.

Requirements for nepheline syenite as a raw material for glass manufacturer include:
*Al2O3 &gt;23%; &gt;14% Na2O + K2O; Fe2O3 &lt;0.1%, 
*Absence of refractory minerals.
*Coarsely ground, typically -40# to +200# mesh.

The typical mineralogical and chemical analysis of a ceramic grade nepheline syenite are:

<text>Christian Rosenkreuz (also spelled Rosenkreutz, Rosencreutz, Christiani Rosencreütz and Christian Rose Cross) is the legendary, possibly allegorical, founder of the Rosicrucian Order (Order of the Rose Cross). He is presented in three manifestos that were published early in the 17th century. These were:
*&quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; (published 1614 in Kassel, Germany) This manifesto introduced the founder, &quot;Frater C.R.C.&quot;
*&quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot; (published 1615 in Kassel, Germany) 
*&quot;The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot; (published 1616 in Strasbourg, France).

==Story==
According to the narrative in the Fama Fraternitatis, Christian Rosenkreuz was a medieval German aristocrat, orphaned at the age of four and raised in a monastery, where he studied for twelve years. On his journeys to the Holy Land as well as through northern Africa and Spain, he is said to have discovered and learned various forms of esoteric wisdom. This journey, which would have taken place in the early 15th century, would have placed him among Turkish, Arab, Jewish, and Persian sages, and possibly Sufi or Zoroastrian masters. Upon returning to his homeland, Rosenkreuz founded the &quot;Fraternity of the Rose Cross&quot; with himself (Frater C.R.C.) as head of a group of 8 members. Under his direction a Temple, called Sanctus Spiritus, or &quot;The House of the Holy Spirit&quot;, was built for the members to return to and meet each year.

In his tomb, discovered 120 years later by a Brother of the Order, it is described that his body was in a perfect state of preservation – as Rosenkreuz had earlier predicted — in a heptagonal chamber erected by himself as a &quot;compendium of the universe&quot;. Inside the tomb were illustrations on the ceiling and the floor representing the heavens and terrestrial worlds, with the seven walls containing various books and instruments belonging to the order. It is described that on the sarcophagus in the center of the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz was an altar upon which was written the words &quot;Jesus mihi omnia, nequaquam vacuum, libertas evangelii, dei intacta gloria, legis jugum&quot; (&quot;Jesus is everything to me, by no means empty, the freedom of the gospel, the untouched glory of God, the yoke of the law&quot;). These words appear to testify to the builder&#x27;s Christian character, yet have been interpreted by some to bear further cosmological significance.

Rosenkreuz&#x27;s crypt, according to the description presented in the legend, is located in the interior of the Earth, recalling the alchemical motto V.I.T.R.I.O.L.:  Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem (&quot;Visit the interior of the Earth; by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone&quot;).

==Historicity==
No verifiable account of Christian Rosenkreuz as a real person exists, while support for his real personage is generally limited to myths and legends. The writer, poet, and playwright Maurice Magre (1877–1941), for example, treated Christian Rosenkreuz as a real person, however made no reference to any source verifying his claim. Today, Magre is historically accepted as a writer of fantastic fiction. In his legendary account, Magre describes Rosenkreuz as the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family that flourished in the 13th century. Their castle allegedly stood in the Thuringian Forest on the Border of Hesse, and they had embraced Albigensian (i.e., Cathar) doctrines, combining Gnostic and Christian beliefs. According to Magre, the whole family was put to death by Konrad von Marburg except for the youngest son, who was only five years old. The boy was then allegedly carried away by a monk who was an Albigensian adept from Languedoc, and then placed in a monastery that had come under the influence of the Albigenses. There, he was educated and made the acquaintance of four of the Brethren who were to be later associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood.

Magre claims his story derives from oral tradition, however, it is likely he read the &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; and invented the backstory for Christian Rosenkreuz, since Magre&#x27;s account closely follows details from the &quot;Fama&quot; – except where Magre inserts details about Rosenkreuz&#x27;s birth and early life. Magre appears to have been unfamiliar with the other manifestos, in particular the &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot;, where details on Rosenkreuz&#x27;s life differ from those stated in Magre&#x27;s account. For example, Magre states that Rosenkreuz and his family lived in the 13th century, whereas the &quot;Confessio&quot; says Rosenkreuz was born in 1378 (14th century).

Some occultists including Rudolf Steiner, Max Heindel and (much later) Guy Ballard, have stated that Rosenkreuz later reappeared as the Count of St. Germain, a courtier, adventurer, and alchemist who reportedly died on 27 February 1784. Steiner once identified one of Rembrandt&#x27;s paintings &quot;A Man in Armour&quot; as a portrait of Christian Rosenkreuz, apparently in a 17th century manifestation. Others believe Rosenkreuz to be a pseudonym used by some famous historical figure – usually Francis Bacon.

==Dates of birth and death==

The year of Christian Rosenkreuz&#x27;s death is not stated directly, but in the second Manifesto the year 1378 is presented as being the birth year of &quot;our Christian Father&quot;. It is elsewhere stated that Rosenkreuz lived for 106 years, which if added to the original date would mean he died in 1484.

==Founding of the Brotherhood==
According to the Fama, Rosenkreuz was 16 when he was in Damcar and he stayed there for 3 years. He then moved on to Egypt for a short time and then moved on to Fez where he stayed for another 2 years. From Fez, he moved on to Spain where he spent an undetermined amount of time. After Spain, Rosenkreuz returned home to Germany. Five years after returning to Germany it is stated that he founded his Brotherhood. If Rosenkreuz had spent approximately the same amount of time in Spain as he did in Damcar and Fez in the story, this might see him in his late 20s or early 30s at the time of the founding of his Brotherhood. This would place the date of its founding in or about c. 1400–1403.

==Numeric symbolism of dates==
The details of Christian Rosenkreuz&#x27;s story may be taken symbolically, seen in the light of how other hermetic or alchemical texts of its time hid details. For example, the work of Francis Bacon. These numbers and years then shouldn&#x27;t be taken literally by students of occultism, who instead might consider them to be allegorical or symbolic statements to be understood by the initiated. Some might also think of the Manifestos as containing particular numerology that follows a Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects. Others may see possible symbolism through Kabbalistic gematria.

==Allegorical symbolism==
The Manifestos are clear about their intended use of symbolism. As directly stated in the Confessio: &quot;We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.&quot; The metaphorical nature of the legends lends a nebulous quality to the origins of Rosicrucianism. The opening of Rosenkreuz&#x27;s tomb on the other may be interpreted to represent cycles in nature or cosmic events. Some may see the opening of new possibilities for mankind consequent on the advances of the 16th and early 17th centuries. Similarly, Rosenkreuz&#x27;s pilgrimage seems to refer to the transmutation steps of the Great Work.

Similar legends may be found in Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s description of the Holy Grail as the &quot;Lapis Exillis&quot;, guarded by the Knights Templar, or in the Philosophers&#x27; stone of the alchemists, the &quot;Lapis Elixir&quot;.

<text>Thomas Bradley (December 29, 1917September 29, 1998) was an American politician, athlete, police officer, and lawyer who served as the 38th Mayor of Los Angeles from 1973 to 1993. Bradley was Los Angeles&#x27; first black mayor, first liberal mayor, and longest-serving mayor. A member of the Democratic Party, Bradley&#x27;s multiracial liberal political coalition was a forerunner of future President of the United States Barack Obama&#x27;s coalition in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.

Bradley went to college at the University of California, Los Angeles, serving as captain of the track team. Bradley joined the Los Angeles Police Department after graduation. Disenchanted with the racism prevalent in the LAPD, Bradley became a lawyer. Bradley won election to the Los Angeles City Council, becoming its first black member in 1963. Bradley ran to be the first black mayor of a major U.S. city in the 1969 L.A. mayoral election. Bradley lost to incumbent conservative mayor Sam Yorty before defeating Yorty in 1973 and 1981. 

In 1973 Bradley became the first liberal mayor of Los Angeles and the first black mayor of a major city with a white majority. Bradley was the second black mayor of a major city after Kenneth A. Gibson in Newark. The Bradley coalition transformed Los Angeles from a conservative, white-dominated city to a liberal multiracial one. Mayor Bradley appointed more women and people of color to political positions than all his predecessors combined. He was widely respected and renowned for his hard work ethic. Bradley was re-elected by landslides in 1977, 1981, and 1985. Bradley&#x27;s main political opponent as mayor was Chief of the LAPD Daryl Gates, and several Bradley budgets cut funding to the LAPD. Bradley was lauded for running the first profitable Summer Olympics in 1984. The Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport is named after him and opened weeks before the 1984 Olympics. Bradley&#x27;s promotion of public transit led to the creation of the Los Angeles Metro in 1990. 

Bradley ran to be the first black Governor of any state since Reconstruction in 1982 and 1986 but was defeated both times by Republican candidate George Deukmejian. Bradley&#x27;s narrow and unexpected 1982 loss was at odds with the polls and was attributed to the racist vote, giving rise to the political term &quot;the Bradley effect&quot;. Bradley was considered a possible vice-presidential nominee in 1984 by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale. Bradley was re-elected a final time as Los Angeles mayor in 1989, with a majority of the vote but diminished support. Bradley&#x27;s approval ratings dropped after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which led to the resignation of Bradley&#x27;s longtime rival Gates. Bradley announced his retirement in 1993. A panel of 69 scholars that year ranked him the third-best mayor of any city in the United States since 1960 and among the nine best mayors in American history.

==Early life and education==

Bradley was born on December 29, 1917, to Lee Thomas and Crenner Bradley. Thomas and Bradley were poor sharecroppers who lived in a small log cabin outside Calvert, Texas. He had four siblings — Lawrence, Willa Mae, Ellis (who had cerebral palsy) and Howard. The children&#x27;s grandfather had been enslaved. The family moved to Arizona to pick cotton and then in 1924 to the Temple-Alvarado area of Los Angeles during the Great Migration, where Lee was a Santa Fe Railroad porter and Crenner was a maid.

Bradley attended Rosemont Elementary School, Lafayette Junior High School and Polytechnic High School, where he was the first black student to be elected president of the Boys League and the first to be inducted into the Ephebians national honor society. He was captain of the track team and all-city tackle for the high school football team. Bradley went to UCLA in 1937 on an athletic scholarship and joined Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Among the jobs he had while at college was as a photographer for comedian Jimmy Durante.

==Career==
===Early career===
Bradley left his studies to join the Los Angeles Police Department in 1940. He became one of 400 black officers in a police department that had 4,000 officers. He recalled &quot;the downtown department store that refused him credit, although he was a police officer, and the restaurants that would not serve blacks.&quot; He told a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter:

When I came on the department, there were literally two assignments for black officers. You either worked Newton Street Division, which has a predominantly black community, or you worked traffic downtown. You could not work with a white officer, and that continued until 1964.

Bradley and Ethel Arnold met at the New Hope Baptist Church and were married May 4, 1941. They had three daughters, Lorraine, Phyllis and a baby who died on the day she was born. He and his wife &quot;needed a white intermediary to buy their first house in Leimert Park, then a virtually all-white section of the city&#x27;s Crenshaw district.&quot;

Bradley was attending Southwestern University Law School while a police officer and began his practice as a lawyer when he retired from the police department. Upon his leaving the office of mayor in 1993, he joined the law offices of Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison, specializing in international trade issues.

Tom Bradley&#x27;s entry into politics came when he decided to become the president of the United Club. The club was part of the California Democratic Council, a liberal, reformist group organized in the 1950s by young Democrats energized by Adlai E. Stevenson&#x27;s presidential campaigns. It was predominantly white and had many Jewish members, thus marking the beginnings of the coalition, which along with Latinos, that would carry him to electoral victory so many times. His choice of a Democratic circle also put him at odds with another political force in the African American community, representatives of poor, all-black areas who were associated with the political organization of Jesse M. Unruh, then an up-and-coming state assemblyman. The early stage of Bradley&#x27;s political career was marked by clashes with African American leaders like onetime California Lieutenant Governor and former U.S. Representative Mervyn Dymally, an Unruh ally.

Bradley was a Prince Hall Freemason.

===Los Angeles City Council===

In June 1961, the post for 10th District was vacated by Charles Navarro when he was elected city controller. Bradley, a police lieutenant living at 3397 Welland Avenue, was one of 12 people to apply for the position. The City Council, which had the power to fill a vacancy, instead appointed Joe E. Hollingsworth. When the position was up for election again, in April 1963, Bradley ran against Hollingsworth.

There were only two candidates, Hollingsworth and Bradley, and also two elections — one for the unexpired term left by Controller Navarro, ending June 30, and one for a full four-year term starting July 1. Bradley won the first, 17,760 to 10,540 votes, and the second election, 17,552 to 10,400 votes. By then he had retired from the police force, and he was sworn in as a councilman at the age of 45 on April 15, 1963, the first African-American elected to City Council.

One of his first votes was in opposition to a proposed study by City Attorney Roger Arnebergh and Police Chief William H. Parker of the &quot;Dictionary of American Slang&quot;, ordered in an 11–4 vote by the council. Councilman Tom Shepard&#x27;s motion said the book was &quot;saturated not only with phrases of sexual filth, but wordage defamatory of minority ethnic groups and definitions insulting religions and races.&quot;

When asked why he did not participate in public demonstrations, Bradley said that he saw his position on the City Council as a way to bring groups together. He expressed a desire to establish a human relations commission for the city.

===Campaign for Mayor of Los Angeles===

In 1969, Bradley first challenged incumbent Mayor Sam Yorty, a conservative Democrat for mayor in the nonpartisan election. Armed with key endorsements (including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;), Bradley held a substantial lead over Yorty in the primary, but was a few percentage points shy of winning the race outright. However, Yorty pulled out a come-from-behind victory to win reelection. Yorty questioned Bradley&#x27;s credibility in fighting crime and painted a picture of Bradley, a fellow Democrat, as a threat to Los Angeles because he would supposedly open up the city to Black Nationalists. Bradley did not use his record as a police officer in the election. With the race factor, even many liberal white voters became hesitant to support Bradley. It would be another four years, in 1973, before Bradley would unseat Yorty.

Powerful downtown business interests at first opposed Bradley. But with passage of the 1974 redevelopment plan and the inclusion of business leaders on influential committees, corporate chiefs moved in behind him. A significant feature of this plan was the development and building of numerous skyscrapers in the Bunker Hill financial district.

===Mayor of Los Angeles===

Bradley served for 20 years as mayor of Los Angeles, surpassing Fletcher Bowron with the longest tenure in that office.
Bradley contributed to the financial success of the city by helping develop the satellite business hubs at Century City and Warner Center. Bradley was a strong supporter of public transit throughout his political career, and he was a driving force behind the construction of Los Angeles&#x27; light rail network. Upon his election as mayor in 1973, Bradley sought to build a comprehensive rail system in Los Angeles. He also pushed for expansion of Los Angeles International Airport and development of terminals in use today. The Tom Bradley International Terminal is named in his honor.

Bradley was offered a cabinet-level position in the administration of President Jimmy Carter, which he turned down. Bradley introduced President Carter at the May 5, 1979, dedication ceremony for the Los Angeles Placita de Dolores.

In 1984, Bradley presided over the first profitable Summer Olympics. That year Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale considered Bradley as a finalist for the vice presidential nomination, which eventually went to U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro of Queens, New York. Bradley was mayor when the city hosted the 1984 Summer Olympics and when the city became the second-most-populated U.S. city after New York, also in 1984.

Although Bradley was a political liberal, he believed that business prosperity was good for the entire city and would generate jobs, an outlook like that of his successor, Richard Riordan. For most of Bradley&#x27;s administration, the city appeared to agree with him. But in his fourth term, with traffic congestion, air pollution and the condition of Santa Monica Bay worsening, and with residential neighborhoods threatened by commercial development, the tide began to turn. In 1989, he was elected to a fifth term, but the ability of opponent Nate Holden to attract one-third of the vote, despite being a neophyte to the Los Angeles City Council and a very late entrant to the mayoral race, signaled that Bradley&#x27;s era was drawing to a close.

Other factors in the waning of his political strength were his decision to reverse himself and support a controversial oil drilling project near the Pacific Palisades and his reluctance to condemn Louis Farrakhan, the Black Muslim minister who made speeches in Los Angeles and elsewhere that many considered anti-Semitic. Further, some key Bradley supporters lost their City Council reelection bids, among them veteran Westside Councilwoman Pat Russell. Bradley chose to leave office in 1993 rather than seek election to a sixth term.

===Gubernatorial campaigns===

Bradley ran for Governor of California twice, in 1982 and 1986, but lost both times to Republican George Deukmejian. He was the first African American to head a gubernatorial ticket in California.

In 1982, the election was extremely close. Bradley led in the polls going into election day, and in the initial hours after the polls closed, some news organizations projected him as the winner. Ultimately, Bradley lost the election by about 100,000 votes, about 1.2% of the 7.5 million votes cast.

These circumstances gave rise to the term the &quot;Bradley effect&quot;, which refers to a tendency of voters to tell interviewers or pollsters that they are undecided or likely to vote for a black candidate, but then actually vote for his white opponent. In 1986, Bradley lost the rematch to Deukmejian by a vote of 4,505,601 (61%) to 2,781,714 (37%).

==Death and Legacy==
Bradley had a heart attack while driving his car in March 1996 and underwent a triple bypass operation. Later, he suffered a stroke &quot;that left him unable to speak clearly.&quot; On September 23, 1998, he was admitted to a hospital in West Los Angeles to be treated for gout. He initially seemed to be faring well, but suffered another heart attack on the morning of September 29 and was pronounced dead at 9:00 a.m., aged 80. His body lay at the Los Angeles Convention Center for public viewing. He was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery.

Tom Bradley&#x27;s political coalition originated with liberal African Americans and liberal white Americans, particularly Jewish Americans. This Bradley coalition expanded to include liberal and moderate whites, Latinos, and Asian Americans and proved a model which would later go nationwide for President Barack Obama coalition in the 2008 United States presidential election. Bradley was the first liberal mayor of Los Angeles, which previously was politically a conservative western town. After the Reagan Revolution led to a drop in federal funding, Bradley changed to become a more business-oriented mayor. Bradley&#x27;s main political opponents were Sam Yorty and LAPD Chief Daryl Gates. Bradley cut funding to the LAPD several times but was unable to reform it. 

A 1993 panel survey of 69 historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Bradley ranked as third-best mayor in the United States since 1960. Bradley was ranked the ninth-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. When the survey was limited only to mayors that were in office post-1960, the results saw Bradley ranked the third-best.

<doc id="434177" wikidata="Q18353783" url="?curid=434177" title="Tracing garbage collection">
<text>In computer programming, tracing garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management that consists of determining which objects should be deallocated (&quot;garbage collected&quot;) by tracing which objects are &quot;reachable&quot; by a chain of references from certain &quot;root&quot; objects, and considering the rest as &quot;garbage&quot; and collecting them. Tracing is the most common type of garbage collection – so much so that &quot;garbage collection&quot; often refers to the tracing method, rather than others such as reference counting – and there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation.

== Reachability of an object ==
Informally, an object is reachable if it is referenced by at least one variable in the program, either directly or through references from other reachable objects. More precisely, objects can be reachable in only two ways:

# A distinguished set of roots: objects that are assumed to be reachable. Typically, these include all the objects referenced from anywhere in the call stack (that is, all local variables and parameters in the functions currently being invoked), and any global variables.
# Anything referenced from a reachable object is itself reachable; more formally, reachability is a transitive closure.

The reachability definition of &quot;garbage&quot; is not optimal, insofar as the last time a program uses an object could be long before that object falls out of the environment scope. A distinction is sometimes drawn between syntactic garbage, those objects the program cannot possibly reach, and semantic garbage, those objects the program will in fact never again use. For example:

Object x = new Foo();
Object y = new Bar();
x = new Quux();
/* At this point, we know that the Foo object 
 * originally assigned to x will never be
 * accessed: it is syntactic garbage.

/* In the following block, y *could* be semantic garbage;
 * but we won&#x27;t know until x.check_something() returns
 * some value -- if it returns at all.
if (x.check_something()) {
 x.do_something(y);
System.exit(0);
The problem of precisely identifying semantic garbage can easily be shown to be partially decidable: a program that allocates an object formula_1, runs an arbitrary input program formula_2, and uses formula_1 if and only if formula_2 finishes would require a semantic garbage collector to solve the halting problem. Although conservative heuristic methods for semantic garbage detection remain an active research area, essentially all practical garbage collectors focus on syntactic garbage.

Another complication with this approach is that, in languages with both reference types and unboxed value types, the garbage collector needs to somehow be able to distinguish which variables on the stack or fields in an object are regular values and which are references: in memory, an integer and a reference might look alike. The garbage collector then needs to know whether to treat the element as a reference and follow it, or whether it is a primitive value. One common solution is the use of tagged pointers.

== Strong and weak references ==
The garbage collector can reclaim only objects that have no references pointing to them either directly or indirectly from the root set. However, some programs require weak references, which should be usable for as long as the object exists but should not prolong its lifetime. In discussions about weak references, ordinary references are sometimes called strong references. An object is eligible for garbage collection if there are no strong (i.e. ordinary) references to it, even though there still might be some weak references to it.

A weak reference is not merely just any pointer to the object that a garbage collector does not care about. The term is usually reserved for a properly managed category of special reference objects which are safe to use even after the object disappears because they &quot;lapse&quot; to a safe value (usually codice_1). An unsafe reference that is not known to the garbage collector will simply remain dangling by continuing to refer to the address where the object previously resided. This is not a weak reference.

In some implementations, weak references are divided into subcategories. For example, the Java Virtual Machine provides three forms of weak references, namely soft references, phantom references, and regular weak references. A softly referenced object is only eligible for reclamation if the garbage collector decides that the program is low on memory. Unlike a soft reference or a regular weak reference, a phantom reference does not provide access to the object that it references. Instead, a phantom reference is a mechanism that allows the garbage collector to notify the program when the referenced object has become &quot;phantom reachable&quot;. An object is phantom reachable, if it still resides in memory and it is referenced by a phantom reference, but its finalizer has already executed. Similarly, Microsoft.NET provides two subcategories of weak references, namely long weak references (tracks resurrection) and short weak references.

== Weak collections ==
Data structures can also be devised which have weak tracking features. For instance, weak hash tables are useful. Like a regular hash table, a weak hash table maintains an association between pairs of objects, where each pair is understood to be a key and value. However, the hash table does not actually maintain a strong reference on these objects. Special behavior takes place when either the key or value or both become garbage: the hash table entry is spontaneously deleted. There exist further refinements such as hash tables which have only weak keys (value references are ordinary, strong references) or only weak values (key references are strong).

Weak hash tables are important for maintaining associations between objects, such that the objects engaged in the association can still become garbage if nothing in the program refers to them any longer (other than the associating hash table).

The use of a regular hash table for such a purpose could lead to a &quot;logical memory leak&quot;: the accumulation of reachable data which the program does not need and will not use.

== Basic algorithm ==
Tracing collectors are so called because they trace through the working set of memory. These garbage collectors perform collection in cycles. It is common for cycles to be triggered when there is not enough free memory for the memory manager to satisfy an allocation request. But cycles can often be requested by the mutator directly or run on a time schedule. The original method involves a naïve &quot;mark-and-sweep&quot; in which the entire memory set is touched several times.

=== Naïve mark-and-sweep ===
In the naive mark-and-sweep method, each object in memory has a flag (typically a single bit) reserved for garbage collection use only. This flag is always &quot;cleared&quot;, except during the collection cycle. 

The first stage is the &quot;mark stage&quot; which does a tree traversal of the entire &#x27;root set&#x27; and marks each object that is pointed to by a root as being &#x27;in-use&#x27;. All objects that those objects point to, and so on, are marked as well, so that every object that is reachable via the root set is marked.

In the second stage, the &quot;sweep stage&quot;, all memory is scanned from start to finish, examining all free or used blocks; those not marked as being &#x27;in-use&#x27; are not reachable by any roots, and their memory is freed. For objects which were marked in-use, the in-use flag is cleared, preparing for the next cycle.

This method has several disadvantages, the most notable being that the entire system must be suspended during collection; no mutation of the working set can be allowed. This can cause programs to &#x27;freeze&#x27; periodically (and generally unpredictably), making some real-time and time-critical applications impossible. In addition, the entire working memory must be examined, much of it twice, potentially causing problems in paged memory systems.

=== Tri-color marking ===
Because of these performance problems, most modern tracing garbage collectors implement some variant of the &quot;tri-color marking&quot; abstraction, but simple collectors (such as the &quot;mark-and-sweep&quot; collector) often do not make this abstraction explicit. Tri-color marking works as described below.

Three sets are created &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;grey&quot;:

* The white set, or &quot;condemned set&quot;, is the set of objects that are candidates for having their memory recycled.
* The black set is the set of objects that can be shown to have no outgoing references to objects in the white set, and to be reachable from the roots. Objects in the black set are not candidates for collection.
* The grey set contains all objects reachable from the roots but yet to be scanned for references to &quot;white&quot; objects. Since they are known to be reachable from the roots, they cannot be garbage-collected and will end up in the black set after being scanned. 

In many algorithms, initially the black set starts as empty, the grey set is the set of objects which are directly referenced from roots and the white set includes all other objects. Every object in memory is at all times in exactly one of the three sets. The algorithm proceeds as following:

# Pick an object o from the grey set
# Move each white object that o references to the grey set. This ensures that neither this object nor any object it references can be garbage-collected.
# Move o to the black set
# Repeat the last three steps until the grey set is empty.

When the grey set is empty, the scan is complete; the black objects are reachable from the roots, while the white objects are not and can be garbage-collected.

Since all objects not immediately reachable from the roots are added to the white set, and objects can only move from white to grey and from grey to black, the algorithm preserves an important invariant no black objects reference white objects. This ensures that the white objects can be freed once the grey set is empty. This is called &quot;the tri-color invariant&quot;. Some variations on the algorithm do not preserve this invariant but use a modified form for which all the important properties hold.

The tri-color method has an important advantage it can be performed &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, without halting the system for significant periods of time. This is accomplished by marking objects as they are allocated and during mutation, maintaining the various sets. By monitoring the size of the sets, the system can perform garbage collection periodically, rather than as needed. Also, the need to touch the entire working set on each cycle is avoided.

== Implementation strategies ==

=== Moving vs. non-moving ===
Once the unreachable set has been determined, the garbage collector may simply release the unreachable objects and leave everything else as it is, or it may copy some or all of the reachable objects into a new area of memory, updating all references to those objects as needed. These are called &quot;non-moving&quot; and &quot;moving&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;non-compacting&quot; and &quot;compacting&quot;) garbage collectors, respectively.

At first, a moving algorithm may seem inefficient compared to a non-moving one, since much more work would appear to be required on each cycle. But the moving algorithm leads to several performance advantages, both during the garbage collection cycle itself and during program execution:
* No additional work is required to reclaim the space freed by dead objects; the entire region of memory from which reachable objects were moved can be considered free space. In contrast, a non-moving GC must visit each unreachable object and record that the memory it occupied is available.
* Similarly, new objects can be allocated very quickly. Since large contiguous regions of memory are usually made available by a moving GC, new objects can be allocated by simply incrementing a &#x27;free memory&#x27; pointer. A non-moving strategy may, after some time, lead to a heavily fragmented heap, requiring expensive consultation of &quot;free lists&quot; of small available blocks of memory in order to allocate new objects.
* If an appropriate traversal order is used (such as cdr-first for list conses), objects can be moved very close to the objects they refer to in memory, increasing the chance that they will be located in the same cache line or virtual memory page. This can significantly speed up access to these objects through these references.

One disadvantage of a moving garbage collector is that it only allows access through references that are managed by the garbage collected environment, and does not allow pointer arithmetic. This is because any pointers to objects will be invalidated if the garbage collector moves those objects (they become dangling pointers). For interoperability with native code, the garbage collector must copy the object contents to a location outside of the garbage collected region of memory. An alternative approach is to &quot;pin&quot; the object in memory, preventing the garbage collector from moving it and allowing the memory to be directly shared with native pointers (and possibly allowing pointer arithmetic).

=== Copying vs. mark-and-sweep vs. mark-and-don&#x27;t-sweep ===
Not only do collectors differ in whether they are moving or non-moving, they can also be categorized by how they treat the white, grey and black object sets during a collection cycle.

The most straightforward approach is the &quot;semi-space collector&quot;, which dates to 1969. In this moving collector, memory is partitioned into an equally sized &quot;from space&quot; and &quot;to space&quot;. Initially, objects are allocated in &quot;to space&quot; until it becomes full and a collection cycle is triggered. At the start of the cycle, the &quot;to space&quot; becomes the &quot;from space&quot;, and vice versa. The objects reachable from the root set are copied from the &quot;from space&quot; to the &quot;to space&quot;. These objects are scanned in turn, and all objects that they point to are copied into &quot;to space&quot;, until all reachable objects have been copied into &quot;to space&quot;. Once the program continues execution, new objects are once again allocated in the &quot;to space&quot; until it is once again full and the process is repeated. 

This approach is very simple, but since only one semi space is used for allocating objects, the memory usage is twice as high compared to other algorithms. The technique is also known as &quot;stop-and-copy&quot;. Cheney&#x27;s algorithm is an improvement on the semi-space collector.

A mark and sweep garbage collector keeps a bit or two with each object to record if it is white or black. The grey set is kept as a separate list or using another bit. As the reference tree is traversed during a collection cycle (the &quot;mark&quot; phase), these bits are manipulated by the collector. A final &quot;sweep&quot; of the memory areas then frees white objects. The mark and sweep strategy has the advantage that, once the condemned set is determined, either a moving or non-moving collection strategy can be pursued. This choice of strategy can be made at runtime, as available memory permits. It has the disadvantage of &quot;bloating&quot; objects by a small amount, as in, every object has a small hidden memory cost because of the list/extra bit. This can be somewhat mitigated if the collector also handles allocation, since then it could potentially use unused bits in the allocation data structures. Or, this &quot;hidden memory&quot; can be eliminated by using a Tagged pointer, trading the memory cost for CPU time. However, the mark and sweep is the only strategy that readily cooperates with external allocators in the first place.

A &quot;mark and don&#x27;t sweep&quot; garbage collector, like the mark-and-sweep, keeps a bit with each object to record if it is white or black; the grey set is kept as a separate list or using another bit. There are two key differences here. First, black and white mean different things than they do in the mark and sweep collector. In a &quot;mark and don&#x27;t sweep&quot; collector, all reachable objects are always black. An object is marked black at the time it is allocated, and it will stay black even if it becomes unreachable. A white object is unused memory and may be allocated. Second, the interpretation of the black/white bit can change. Initially, the black/white bit may have the sense of (0=white, 1=black). If an allocation operation ever fails to find any available (white) memory, that means all objects are marked used (black). The sense of the black/white bit is then inverted (for example, 0=black, 1=white). Everything becomes white. This momentarily breaks the invariant that reachable objects are black, but a full marking phase follows immediately, to mark them black again. Once this is done, all unreachable memory is white. No &quot;sweep&quot; phase is necessary. 

The mark and don&#x27;t sweep strategy requires cooperation between the allocator and collector, but is incredibly space efficient since it only requires one bit per allocated pointer (which most allocation algorithms require anyway). However, this upside is somewhat mitigated, since most of the time large portions of memory are wrongfully marked black (used), making it hard to give resources back to the system (for use by other allocators, threads, or processes) in times of low memory usage. 

The mark and don&#x27;t sweep strategy can therefore be seen as a compromise between the upsides and downsides of the mark and sweep and the stop and copy strategies.

=== Generational GC (ephemeral GC) ===
It has been empirically observed that in many programs, the most recently created objects are also those most likely to become unreachable quickly (known as &quot;infant mortality&quot; or the &quot;generational hypothesis&quot;). A generational GC (also known as ephemeral GC) divides objects into generations and, on most cycles, will place only the objects of a subset of generations into the initial white (condemned) set. Furthermore, the runtime system maintains knowledge of when references cross generations by observing the creation and overwriting of references. When the garbage collector runs, it may be able to use this knowledge to prove that some objects in the initial white set are unreachable without having to traverse the entire reference tree. If the generational hypothesis holds, this results in much faster collection cycles while still reclaiming most unreachable objects.

In order to implement this concept, many generational garbage collectors use separate memory regions for different ages of objects. When a region becomes full, the objects in it are traced, using the references from the older generation(s) as roots. This usually results in most objects in the generation being collected (by the hypothesis), leaving it to be used to allocate new objects. When a collection doesn&#x27;t collect many objects (the hypothesis doesn&#x27;t hold, for example because the program has computed a large collection of new objects it does want to retain), some or all of the surviving objects that are referenced from older memory regions are promoted to the next highest region, and the entire region can then be overwritten with fresh objects. This technique permits very fast incremental garbage collection, since the garbage collection of only one region at a time is all that is typically required.

Ungar&#x27;s classic generation scavenger has two generations. It divides the youngest generation, called &quot;new space&quot;, into a large &quot;eden&quot; in which new objects are created and two smaller &quot;survivor spaces&quot;, past survivor space and future survivor space. The objects in the older generation that may reference objects in new space are kept in a &quot;remembered set&quot;. On each scavenge, the objects in new space are traced from the roots in the remembered set and copied to future survivor space. If future survivor space fills up, the objects that do not fit are promoted to old space, a process called &quot;tenuring&quot;. At the end of the scavenge, some objects reside in future survivor space, and eden and past survivor space are empty. Then future survivor space and past survivor space are exchanged and the program continues, allocating objects in eden. In Ungar&#x27;s original system, eden is 5 times larger than each survivor space.

Generational garbage collection is a heuristic approach, and some unreachable objects may not be reclaimed on each cycle. It may therefore occasionally be necessary to perform a full mark and sweep or copying garbage collection to reclaim all available space. In fact, runtime systems for modern programming languages (such as Java and the .NET Framework) usually use some hybrid of the various strategies that have been described thus far; for example, most collection cycles might look only at a few generations, while occasionally a mark-and-sweep is performed, and even more rarely a full copying is performed to combat fragmentation. The terms &quot;minor cycle&quot; and &quot;major cycle&quot; are sometimes used to describe these different levels of collector aggression.

=== Stop-the-world vs. incremental vs. concurrent ===

Simple &quot;stop-the-world&quot; garbage collectors completely halt execution of the program to run a collection cycle, thus guaranteeing that new objects are not allocated and objects do not suddenly become unreachable while the collector is running.

This has the disadvantage that the program can perform no useful work while a collection cycle is running (sometimes called the &quot;embarrassing pause&quot;). Stop-the-world garbage collection is therefore mainly suitable for non-interactive programs. Its advantage is that it is both simpler to implement and faster than incremental garbage collection.

&quot;Incremental&quot; and &quot;concurrent&quot; garbage collectors are designed to reduce this disruption by interleaving their work with activity from the main program. &quot;Incremental&quot; garbage collectors perform the garbage collection cycle in discrete phases, with program execution permitted between each phase (and sometimes during some phases). &quot;Concurrent&quot; garbage collectors do not stop program execution at all, except perhaps briefly when the program&#x27;s execution stack is scanned. However, the sum of the incremental phases takes longer to complete than one batch garbage collection pass, so these garbage collectors may yield lower total throughput.

Careful design is necessary with these techniques to ensure that the main program does not interfere with the garbage collector and vice versa; for example, when the program needs to allocate a new object, the runtime system may either need to suspend it until the collection cycle is complete, or somehow notify the garbage collector that there exists a new, reachable object.

=== Precise vs. conservative and internal pointers ===
Some collectors can correctly identify all pointers (references) in an object; these are called &quot;precise&quot; (also &quot;exact&quot; or &quot;accurate&quot;) collectors, the opposite being a &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;partly conservative&quot; collector. Conservative collectors assume that any bit pattern in memory could be a pointer if, interpreted as a pointer, it would point into an allocated object. Conservative collectors may produce false positives, where unused memory is not released because of improper pointer identification. This is not always a problem in practice unless the program handles a lot of data that could easily be misidentified as a pointer. False positives are generally less problematic on 64-bit systems than on 32-bit systems because the range of valid memory addresses tends to be a tiny fraction of the range of 64-bit values. Thus, an arbitrary 64-bit pattern is unlikely to mimic a valid pointer. A false negative can also happen if pointers are &quot;hidden&quot;, for example using an XOR linked list. Whether a precise collector is practical usually depends on the type safety properties of the programming language in question. An example for which a conservative garbage collector would be needed is the C language, which allows typed (non-void) pointers to be type cast into untyped (void) pointers, and vice versa.

A related issue concerns &quot;internal pointers&quot;, or pointers to fields within an object. If the semantics of a language allow internal pointers, then there may be many different addresses that can refer to parts of the same object, which complicates determining whether an object is garbage or not. An example for this is the C++ language, in which multiple inheritance can cause pointers to base objects to have different addresses. In a tightly optimized program, the corresponding pointer to the object itself may have been overwritten in its register, so such internal pointers need to be scanned.

== Performance ==
Performance of tracing garbage collectors – both latency and throughput – depends significantly on the implementation, workload, and environment. Naive implementations or use in very memory-constrained environments, notably embedded systems, can result in very poor performance compared with other methods, while sophisticated implementations and use in environments with ample memory can result in excellent performance. 

In terms of throughput, tracing by its nature requires some implicit runtime overhead, though in some cases the amortized cost can be extremely low, in some cases even lower than one instruction per allocation or collection, outperforming stack allocation. Manual memory management requires overhead due to explicit freeing of memory, and reference counting has overhead from incrementing and decrementing reference counts, and checking if the count has overflowed or dropped to zero.

In terms of latency, simple stop-the-world garbage collectors pause program execution for garbage collection, which can happen at arbitrary times and take arbitrarily long, making them unusable for real-time computing, notably embedded systems, and a poor fit for interactive use, or any other situation where low latency is a priority. However, incremental garbage collectors can provide hard real-time guarantees, and on systems with frequent idle time and sufficient free memory, such as personal computers, garbage collection can be scheduled for idle times and have minimal impact on interactive performance. Manual memory management (as in C++) and reference counting have a similar issue of arbitrarily long pauses in case of deallocating a large data structure and all its children, though these only occur at fixed times, not depending on garbage collection.

; Manual heap allocation:
* search for best/first-fit block of sufficient size
* free list maintenance

; Garbage collection:
* locate reachable objects
* copy reachable objects for moving collectors
* read/write barriers for incremental collectors
* search for best/first-fit block and free list maintenance for non-moving collectors

It is difficult to compare the two cases directly, as their behavior depends on the situation. For example, in the best case for a garbage collecting system, allocation just increments a pointer, but in the best case for manual heap allocation, the allocator maintains freelists of specific sizes and allocation only requires following a pointer. However, this size segregation usually cause a large degree of external fragmentation, which can have an adverse impact on cache behaviour. Memory allocation in a garbage collected language may be implemented using heap allocation behind the scenes (rather than simply incrementing a pointer), so the performance advantages listed above don&#x27;t necessarily apply in this case. In some situations, most notably embedded systems, it is possible to avoid both garbage collection and heap management overhead by preallocating pools of memory and using a custom, lightweight scheme for allocation/deallocation.

The overhead of write barriers is more likely to be noticeable in an imperative-style program which frequently writes pointers into existing data structures than in a functional-style program which constructs data only once and never changes them.

Some advances in garbage collection can be understood as reactions to performance issues. Early collectors were stop-the-world collectors, but the performance of this approach was distracting in interactive applications. Incremental collection avoided this disruption, but at the cost of decreased efficiency due to the need for barriers. Generational collection techniques are used with both stop-the-world and incremental collectors to increase performance; the trade-off is that some garbage is not detected as such for longer than normal.

== Determinism ==
* Tracing garbage collection is not deterministic in the timing of object finalization. An object which becomes eligible for garbage collection will usually be cleaned up eventually, but there is no guarantee when (or even if) that will happen. This is an issue for program correctness when objects are tied to non-memory resources, whose release is an externally visible program behavior, such as closing a network connection, releasing a device or closing a file. One garbage collection technique which provides determinism in this regard is reference counting.
* Garbage collection can have a nondeterministic impact on execution time, by potentially introducing pauses into the execution of a program which are not correlated with the algorithm being processed. Under tracing garbage collection, the request to allocate a new object can sometimes return quickly and at other times trigger a lengthy garbage collection cycle. Under reference counting, whereas allocation of objects is usually fast, decrementing a reference is nondeterministic, since a reference may reach zero, triggering recursion to decrement the reference counts of other objects which that object holds.

== Real-time garbage collection ==

While garbage collection is generally nondeterministic, it is possible to use it in hard real-time systems. A real-time garbage collector should guarantee that even in the worst case it will dedicate a certain number of computational resources to mutator threads. Constraints imposed on a real-time garbage collector are usually either work based or time based. A time based constraint would look like: within each time window of duration formula_5, mutator threads should be allowed to run at least for formula_6 time. For work based analysis, MMU (minimal mutator utilization) is usually used as a real-time constraint for the garbage collection algorithm.

One of the first implementations of hard real-time garbage collection for the JVM was based on the Metronome algorithm, whose commercial implementation is available as part of the IBM WebSphere Real Time. Another hard real-time garbage collection algorithm is Staccato, available in the IBM&#x27;s J9 JVM, which also provides scalability to large multiprocessor architectures, while bringing various advantages over Metronome and other algorithms which, on the contrary, require specialized hardware.

One major challenge for real-time garbage collection on modern multi-core architectures is in designing a non-blocking concurrent garbage collection, not letting the concurrent threads block each other and create unpredictable pauses. A study of algorithms that allow non-blocking real-time concurrent garbage collection appears in a paper by Pizlo et al. in Microsoft Research.

<doc id="434178" wikidata="Q3122244" url="?curid=434178" title="Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick">
<text>Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick ( 1272 – 12 August 1315) was an English magnate, and one of the principal opponents of King Edward II and his favourite, Piers Gaveston. Guy was the son of William de Beauchamp, the first Beauchamp earl of Warwick, and succeeded his father in 1298. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Falkirk and subsequently, as a capable servant of the crown under King Edward I. After the succession of Edward II in 1307, however, he soon fell out with the new king and the king&#x27;s favourite, Piers Gaveston. Warwick was one of the main architects behind the Ordinances of 1311, that limited the powers of the king and banished Gaveston into exile.

When Gaveston returned to England in 1312—contrary to the rulings of the Ordinances—he was taken into custody by Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Warwick abducted Gaveston and, together with Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, had him executed. The act garnered sympathy and support for the king, but Warwick and Lancaster nevertheless managed to negotiate a royal pardon for their actions. After the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, King Edward&#x27;s authority was once more weakened, and the rebellious barons took over control of government. For Warwick the triumph was brief; he died the next year.

Guy de Beauchamp is today remembered primarily for his part in the killing of Gaveston, but by his contemporaries he was considered a man of exceptionally good judgement and learning. He owned what was for his time a large collection of books, and his advice was often sought by many of the other earls. Next to Lancaster, he was the wealthiest peer in the nation, and after his death his lands and title were inherited by his son, Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick.

== Family background ==
Guy de Beauchamp was the first son and heir of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (c. 1238 – 1298). His mother was Maud FitzJohn, daughter of John Fitzgeoffrey, who was Justiciar of Ireland and a member of the council of fifteen that imposed the Provisions of Oxford on King Henry III. William was the nephew of William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick, and when his uncle died without issue in 1268, he became the first Beauchamp earl of Warwick. In 1271 or 1272 his first son was born, and in reference to the new family title, William named his son after the legendary hero Guy of Warwick. William de Beauchamp was a capable military commander, who played an important part in the Welsh and Scottish wars of King Edward I.

A marriage between Guy and Isabel de Clare, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, was contemplated, or possibly even took place and then annulled. It was not until early 1309 that Guy married Alice de Toeni, a wealthy Hertfordshire heiress. By this time Guy had already succeeded as Earl of Warwick, after his father&#x27;s death in 1298.

By his wife, Alice, Guy had two daughters and two sons—Thomas, his heir and successor, and John de Beauchamp, Lord Beauchamp KG (1315 – 2 December 1360), who carried the royal standard at the Battle of Crécy.
*Maud de Beauchamp (died 1366), married before Easter term 1332 Geoffrey de Say, 2nd Lord Say, by whom she had issue. The Barons Saye and Sele are their descendants.
*Elizabeth de Beauchamp (c. 1316 – 1359), married before Easter term 1332 Thomas Astley, 3rd Lord Astley, by whom she had two sons, William Astley, 4th Lord Astley and Sir Thomas Astley, ancestor of the Astleys of Patshull and of Everley.

By an unknown mistress (or mistresses), Earl Guy also had three daughters:
*Isabel de Beauchamp; married John de Clinton.
*Emma de Beauchamp; married Roland de Oddingseles.
*Lucia de Beauchamp (also known as Lucy); married Robert de Napton, Knt., the son of Sir Adam Napton. Lucia and Sir Robert had a son Adam Napton, who married Margaret Helier.

== Service to Edward I ==
Edward I knighted Guy de Beauchamp at Easter 1296. Warwick&#x27;s career of public service started with the Falkirk campaign in 1298. Here he distinguished himself, and received a reward of Scottish lands worth 1,000 marks a year. At this point his father was already dead, but it was not until 5 September that Guy did homage to the king for his lands, and became Earl of Warwick and hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire for life. He continued in the king&#x27;s service in Scotland and elsewhere. In 1299 he helped negotiate the Treaty of Montreuil betrothing Prince Edward of Caernarfon to the French princess Isabella and he was also present at the king&#x27;s own wedding to Margaret of France at Canterbury, and in 1300 he took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock Castle. The next year he was a signatory to a letter to the Pope, rejecting Rome&#x27;s authority over the Scottish question, and also participated in negotiations with the French over the release of the Scottish king John Balliol. He was present at the Siege of Stirling in 1304, serving under Edward, the Prince of Wales. In March 1307 he made preparations to accompany Prince Edward to France, but this journey never took place.

Early in 1307, Edward I made his last grant to Warwick, when he gave him John Balliol&#x27;s forfeited lordship of Barnard Castle in County Durham. On 7 July that year, near Burgh by Sands in Cumberland, Warwick was present when King Edward died. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, he carried the ceremonial swords at the coronation of King Edward II on 25 February 1308.

== Conflict with Edward II ==
Before his death, the old king had exiled Prince Edward&#x27;s favourite Piers Gaveston, and Warwick was among those charged with preventing Gaveston&#x27;s return. The new king, however, not only recalled his favourite, but soon also gave him the title of earl of Cornwall. Warwick was the only one of the leading earls who did not seal the charter, and from the start took on an antagonistic attitude to Edward II. Gaveston was a relative upstart in the English aristocracy, and made himself unpopular among the established nobility by his arrogance and his undue influence on the king. He gave mocking nicknames to the leading men of the realm, and called Warwick the &quot;Black Dog of Arden&quot;.
Gaveston was once more forced into exile, but Edward recalled him in less than a year. The king had spent the intervening time gathering support, and at the time, the only one to resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick. With time, however, opposition to the king grew. Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father&#x27;s Scottish campaigns, a policy that opened the Border region up to devastating raids from the Scots. This affected Warwick greatly, with his extensive landed interest in the north. Tensions grew to the point where the king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms. They still did, and at the parliament of March 1310, the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform of the royal government.

The leaders of these so-called Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the side of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the most experienced of the earls, and took on a modifying role in the group. Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln&#x27;s son-in-law and heir, was the king&#x27;s cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, but at this point he took a less active part in the reform movement. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; he was certainly the most aggressive. The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king&#x27;s financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers. It also—once more—ordered Gaveston to be exiled, to return only at the risk of excommunication.

== Gaveston&#x27;s death ==
Gaveston&#x27;s third and final exile was of even shorter duration, and after two months, he was reunited with King Edward II in England. Archbishop Winchelsey responded by excommunicating Gaveston, as the Ordinances had stipulated. Lancaster, who had by this time succeeded his father-in-law Lincoln, had taken over leadership of the baronial opposition. While the King departed for York, a number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston. Gaveston ensconced himself at Scarborough Castle, and on 19 May 1312, agreed on a surrender to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, as long as his security would be guaranteed.

Pembroke lodged his prisoner in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle. Here, in the presence of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hill—on Lancaster&#x27;s lands—and decapitated. According to the &quot;Annales Londonienses&quot; chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back to where they found it. Gaveston&#x27;s body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.

The brutality and questionable legality of the earls&#x27; actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, as he had been made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.

== Death and historical assessment ==

In mid-July Warwick had to withdraw from government to his estates on account of illness. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which his family had been benefactors. In value, his possessions were second only to those of the earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England.
His lands, though primarily centred on Warwickshire and Worcestershire, were spread over nineteen counties as well as Scotland and the Welsh Marches. His heir was his eldest son, whom he had named Thomas after the earl of Lancaster. Thomas, born probably on 14 February 1314, did not succeed to his father&#x27;s title until 1326, as Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick. In the meanwhile Warwick&#x27;s possessions went into the hands of the king, who donated Warwick&#x27;s hunting dogs to the earl of Pembroke. A younger son, named John, also became a peer, as John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp. Like his elder brother, he distinguished himself in the French wars, and was a founding member of the Order of the Garter.

Guy de Beauchamp is probably best remembered for his opposition to King Edward II, and for his part in the death of Gaveston. To contemporaries, however, he was considered a man of considerable learning and wisdom. His library, of which he donated 42 books to Bordesley Abbey during his lifetime, was extensive. It contained several saints&#x27; lives as well as romances about Alexander and King Arthur. As mentioned, Edward I entrusted the supervision of his son to Warwick. Likewise, when the earl of Lincoln died in 1311, he supposedly instructed his son-in-law Thomas of Lancaster to heed the advice of Warwick, &quot;the wisest of the peers&quot;. Chronicles also praised Warwick&#x27;s wisdom; the &quot;Vita Edwardi Secundi&quot; says that &quot;Other earls did many things only after taking his opinion: in wisdom and council he had no peer&quot;. Later historians have reflected this view; in the 19th century, William Stubbs called Warwick &quot;a discriminating and highly literate man, the wisdom of whom shone forth through the whole kingdom&quot;. He was politically and economically well connected by traditional ties of kinship and marriage.

Warwick&#x27;s death came at an inconvenient time and Thomas of Lancaster proved unequal to the task of governing the nation, so that further years of conflict and instability followed. Nevertheless, the problems of Edward II&#x27;s reign were deep, and in the words of Michael Hicks: &quot;one must doubt whether even Warwick could have brought unity as one chronicler supposed&quot;.

<text>Santa Anita Park is a Thoroughbred racetrack in Arcadia, California, United States. It offers some of the prominent horse racing events in the United States during early fall, winter and in spring. The track is home to numerous prestigious races, including both the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap. It has also hosted the year-end Breeders&#x27; Cup races eleven times, more than any other racetrack. In 1984, Santa Anita was the site of equestrian events at the 1984 Olympics. Since 2011, the Stronach Group are the current owners.

==History==

&quot;Rancho Santa Anita&quot; was owned originally by former San Gabriel Mission Mayor-Domo, Claudio Lopez, and named after a family member, &quot;Anita Cota&quot;. The ranch was later acquired by rancher Hugo Reid, a Scotsman. The property&#x27;s most widely known owner would be multimillionaire Lucky Baldwin, a successful businessman in San Francisco who greatly enhanced his wealth through an investment in the famous Comstock Lode. Baldwin became a successful breeder and owner of Thoroughbred racehorses and in 1904 built a racetrack adjacent to the present site. On February 4, 1909 the California State Legislature passed an anti-racetrack gambling bill known as the Walker–Otis Law. Similar in its goal to New York State&#x27;s 1908 Hart–Agnew Law, the California law resulted in the permanent closing of the Baldwin racetrack. In 1912 the racing facility burned to the ground.

In 1933, California legalized parimutuel wagering and several investor groups worked to open racetracks. In the San Francisco area, a group headed by Dr. Charles H &quot;Doc&quot; Strub was having trouble locating a site. In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer Hal Roach was in need of further funds. These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club opened the present day track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first formally-established racetrack in California. Architect Gordon Kaufmann designed its various buildings in a combination of Colonial Revival and a type of Art Deco known as Streamline Moderne, painted primarily in Santa Anita&#x27;s signature colors of Persian Green and Chiffon Yellow.

In February 1935, the first Santa Anita Handicap was run. The race&#x27;s $100,000 purse, largest of any race ever in the United States until that time, produced its nickname the Big &#x27;Cap. 
In its heyday, the track&#x27;s races attracted such stars as Betty Grable, Lana Turner, Edgar Bergen, Jane Russell, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, and Esther Williams, among others. Bing Crosby, Joe E. Brown, Al Jolson, and Harry Warner were all stockholders.
In 1940, Seabiscuit won the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start.

In 1942, racing at Santa Anita was suspended due to the Second World War. Santa Anita was used as an assembly center for Japanese Americans excluded from the West Coast. For several months in 1942, over 18,000 people lived in horse stables and military-style barracks constructed on the site, including actor George Takei, then a young boy. After the track reopened in 1945, it went through the postwar years with prosperity. A downhill turf course, which added a distinctly European flair to racing at Santa Anita, was added in 1953.

Due to its proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Anita has traditionally been associated with the film and television industries. The racetrack sequences in the Marx Brothers 1937 classic &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; were filmed there, and &quot;The Story of Seabiscuit&quot; with Shirley Temple was filmed on location in 1949. It was also featured in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937). Several stars, including Bing Crosby, Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn, Alex Trebek, and MGM mogul, Louis B. Mayer, have owned horses that raced at the park.

The 1958 Santa Anita Derby was attended by 61,123 people, making the attendance that day a record crowd. They had come to watch Silky Sullivan come from 28 lengths off the pace and win—going away.

The 1960s brought about a major renovation of Santa Anita Park, including a much-expanded grandstand as well as major seating additions. In 1968, Del Mar Racetrack relinquished its dates for a fall meeting. A group of horsemen including Clement Hirsch intervened and established the not-for-profit Oak Tree Racing Association. Oak Tree had no facilities of its own and rented Santa Anita Park for its first autumn meeting in 1969. The Oak Tree Association became the operator of the autumn meet at Santa Anita Park. This meet usually ran from the end of September until early November. Many key stakes races were held during the Oak Tree Meeting, including many preps to the Breeders&#x27; Cup races. The Oak Tree meet relocated to Hollywood Park for 2010 but the California Horse Racing Board awarded the fall dates to Santa Anita in its own right in 2011. This prompted a renaming of many stakes races held at the fall meeting that were formerly associated with Oak Tree. For example, the Norfolk, Goodwood, Yellow Ribbon, Lady&#x27;s Secret, and Oak Leaf, were renamed at the FrontRunner, Awesome Again, Rodeo Drive, Zenyatta and Chandelier respectively.

Prosperity continued at Santa Anita throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1984, Santa Anita hosted the equestrian events at the 1984 Olympics, and in 1985, the track set an attendance record of 85,527 people on Santa Anita Handicap Day. Recognizing the potential revenue boon to the State of California, the California Legislature expanded off track betting, bring operating betting parlors within closer driving distance of the race-day tracks. While the Santa Anita meeting could still draw large crowds, attendance had decreased by a third. Only 56,810 people were at the park for Santa Anita Derby Day 2007 to witness a Grade I event.

In 1997, Santa Anita Park was acquired by Meditrust when it purchased the Santa Anita Companies for its unique real estate investment trust paired share corporate structure. Following the elimination of the special tax treatment accorded Pair Share REITs, Meditrust sold the track to Magna Entertainment Corp. In 2006, Gulfstream Park and Santa Anita cohosted the Sunshine Millions, a day of competition with $3.6 million in stakes races between horses bred in the State of Florida and those bred in the State of California.

At Santa Anita, harness racing was also conducted.

At Santa Anita Park&#x27;s European-style paddock there are statues of jockeys George Woolf, Johnny Longden, Bill Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay Jr. plus a memorial bust of announcer Joe Hernandez and one of trainer Charlie Whittingham with his dog, Toby. There is also a lifesize bronze of Seabiscuit in the walking ring at Seabiscuit Court; a similar bronze of John Henry was unveiled near the Seabiscuit statue in December 2009. Buried near the paddock is Emperor of Norfolk, the best horse Lucky Baldwin ever owned, along with three other great Baldwin horses: Volante, Silver Cloud, and Rey El Santa Anita, all four of them winners of the prestigious American Derby. In 2012, a lifesize bronze of Zenyatta was unveiled prior to the running of the race renamed in her honor.

Since 1950, Santa Anita Park has annually presented the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award to a rider who demonstrates high standards of personal and professional conduct, on and off the racetrack.

South African native Trevor Denman served as Santa Anita&#x27;s full-time announcer from the 1983 Oak Tree meet until his retirement from the position in 2015. Denman is noted for his calls beginning with &quot;And awaaay they go...&quot; and his distinctive gravelly voice. Queensland, Australia native Michael Wrona was chosen to succeed Denman in March 2016. At the end of 2018, The Stronach Group named Frank Mirahmadi as Santa Anita&#x27;s announcer. 

Starting in 2014, Santa Anita began adding more racing cards due to the closure of Hollywood Park Racetrack, hosting Hollywood Park&#x27;s old spring dates from late April until June.

In mid-March 2020, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, racing resumed without fans; two weeks later, racing was suspended until May 15, 2020.

During the January 2025 Southern California wildfires Santa Anita&#x27;s parking lots were used to distribute relief supplies to affected residents, as well as for emergency staging for agencies including Southern California Edison. Three days of live racing were cancelled due to fire and air quality concerns, as the track lied within close proximity to the Eaton Fire.

===Horse fatalities of 2019===
In early March 2019, all races were cancelled following the 21st fatality of the winter season; racing resumed late in the month. Races were postponed so that the dirt surface could be studied. Seven of the 21 deaths occurred during races on the dirt oval with nine happening during training on dirt and the others occurring on the turf track.

Thirty-seven horses died at the facility in 2019, causing the above noted suspension of races, and resulting in the California Racing Commission considering rule changes. Following the death of the 30th horse in late June, trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, who had trained four of the horses that died, was banned forever by the Stronach Group from all of its facilities.

===Santa Anita Assembly Center===


In February 1942, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to exclude &quot;any or all persons&quot; from certain areas in the name of national defense, the Western Defense Command began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for &quot;evacuation&quot; from the newly created military zones. Seventeen temporary &quot;assembly centers&quot; were designated to house the evicted population until construction on the more permanent and isolated internment camps was finished. Most, like the Santa Anita Assembly Center, were converted from former uses like racing tracks or fairgrounds.

Santa Anita was turned over to the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the government body responsible for oversight of the temporary detention facilities, in March 1942, and army engineers soon after built 500 barracks on the parking lot and converted the horse stables and the area underneath the grandstand into residential &quot;apartments&quot;. Japanese-Americans began arriving in April, most coming from the surrounding Los Angeles County, and the center&#x27;s population soon topped 18,000, peaking at 18,719 by August of that year. Six mess halls, each seating approximately 850 at a time, fed some 3,000 people daily at a cost of 33 cents per person. The sanitary facilities faced similar overcrowding, with a ratio of 30 people to each shower &quot;after&quot; the number of showers was increased from 150 to 225 in early July. Consequently, those in the center spent a significant portion of their time in Santa Anita waiting in line for meals or to use the sanitary facilities.

The Assembly Center remained open for seven months, and in the meantime, Japanese-Americans took up jobs in camp at the camouflage net factory, the hospital or various administrative departments, and set up schools to ensure their children&#x27;s education would not be interrupted. Transfer to War Relocation Authority camps began on August 26, 1942, when 901 Japanese-Americans left for Poston, Arizona, and over the next month the remaining Japanese-Americans were sent to Poston and several other camps. The Santa Anita Assembly Center closed on October 27, 1942.

==Course attributes==
Santa Anita has a one-mile (1,609 m) natural dirt main track which rings a turf course measuring 0.9 mile, or . In addition, it has an unusual hillside turf course which crosses the dirt and had been used mainly to run turf races at a distance of &quot;about&quot; 6½ furlongs (exact distance is ), as well as longer races at 1.25 miles, 1.5 miles and 1 mile 1,232 yards. This type of track is one of the few of its kind in America.

In August 2020, Santa Anita broke ground on a new backstretch turf chute. The new turf chute is expected to be finished in time for the 2020/2021 winter meet, and will be used primarily for turf sprints at distances up to 6½ furlongs. Santa Anita effectively ended downhill turf sprints following an incident in the 2019 San Simeon Stakes; under their plans, the hillside turf course will continue to be used for distance races.

To comply with a State of California mandate, Santa Anita replaced its dirt racing surface with a new synthetic surface, a mixture of silica sand, synthetic fibers, elastic fiber, granulated rubber and a wax coating. The new track opened for training on Sept 4, 2007 and hosted its first live race on Sept 26, 2007. The track lost 11 racing dates in 2008 due to a drainage problem with the new material, but intensive maintenance and the addition of a liquid binder greatly improved the artificial surface. Santa Anita restored the all natural dirt surface in December 2010.

Santa Anita occupies . It has a -long grandstand, which is a historic landmark that seats 26,000 guests. The grandstand facade is rendered in an Art Deco style and is largely the original from the 1930s. The track infield area, which resembles a park with picnic tables and large trees, can accommodate 50,000 or more guests. The Park also contains 61 barns, which house more than 2,000 horses, and an equine hospital.

==Proposed redevelopment==
In 2000, the racetrack was named to America&#x27;s &quot;Most Endangered Historic Places&quot; list. The Santa Anita Racetrack was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, but continued to be threatened by developer&#x27;s plans. A themed entertainment complex proposal was aborted, but there were new plans are in the works for the parking and support areas adjacent to the historic race track and grandstands.

In 2006, there was a proposal to close Santa Anita Park and use its location as the site of a new retail/entertainment complex. The Arcadia City Council approved a plan In April 2007 to develop an 830,000 square foot commercial, retail, and office complex in the south parking area, where the barracks that housed interned Japanese Americans during World War II are located. The proposal planned to tear down the South Ticket Gate and the 1938 Saddling Barn, and to install a simulcast facility in the center of the historic grandstand. In April 2008, a plan was approved to use large parts of the existing track parking lot to construct a mall, the &quot;Shops at Santa Anita&quot;.

, the plans to build another mall next to Santa Anita Park were abandoned. Protests against the project by the Westfield Group, owner of the adjacent Westfield Santa Anita mall (built in 1974 on the site of the old barns and training track), and the bankruptcy of Magna International, owner of Santa Anita Park, were a factor in the decision.

<text>The Watersheds of Indiana consist of six distinct Indiana watershed regions that drain into five major bodies of water.

==Illinois River watershed==

With the Kankakee River, the Illinois River watershed stretches from the Illinois border in northwest Indiana and up into Michigan&#x27;s Berrien County, adjacent to St. Joseph County.

This drainage area include most of the state known as the Northwest Indiana, including the city of La Porte but excluding the area north of the Valparaiso Moraine which drains into Lake Michigan.

==Lake Michigan watersheds==
There are two watersheds in the state that drain into Lake Michigan. In the northwest part of the state, it includes the Grand Calumet River area in Lake and Porter counties, and includes the cities of Gary and Hammond. This watershed is defined by the Valparaiso Moraine.

The second, and larger Lake Michigan watershed is the St. Joseph River watershed, which drains the north central and northeastern part of the state. It includes the cities of South Bend, Elkhart, Mishawaka and Goshen.

==Maumee River watershed==
The smallest watershed in the state is the Maumee River watershed in the northeast part of the state on the border with Ohio. It includes most of the city of Fort Wayne as well as the cities of New Haven, Woodburn, and Auburn. The Maumee eventually empties into Lake Erie at Toledo, Ohio.

==Ohio River watershed==
The Ohio River watershed includes the extreme southern part of the state as well as the extreme southwestern Indiana counties. This drainage area includes the cities of Evansville, Richmond and New Albany as well as the Indiana suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Wabash River watershed==

By far the largest watershed in the state, the Wabash River drainage area contains the several large cities, including Indianapolis and the extreme western part of Fort Wayne. Other cities included in the area are Bloomington, Muncie, Lafayette, Anderson and Terre Haute. This watershed also includes most of Indiana&#x27;s prime farm land. The area within the Lower Wabash Valley is also known as &quot;Watermelon Country&quot;, largely due to its sandy soil on which watermelons and cantaloupes thrive. Cities within this area include Vincennes, Sullivan. Many towns of this area have &quot;Watermelon Festivals&quot; such as Owensville, Poseyville and Vincennes (Knox County) usually at harvest time (first weeks of August).

<doc id="434187" wikidata="Q923162" url="?curid=434187" title="Thomas Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick">
<text>Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick, KG (c. 14 February 131313 November 1369), sometimes styled as Lord Warwick, was an English nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. His reputation as a military leader was so formidable that he was nicknamed &quot;the devil Warwick&quot; by the French.
In 1348 he became one of the founders and the third Knight of the Order of the Garter.

Thomas was undoubtedly a brave warrior in battle and proved to be a strong military leader. For example, the 14th century Anonimalle Chronicle states that when news arrived of his landing at Calais, the Duke of Burgundy, whose forces were camped nearby, made a hasty retreat under cover of darkness to avoid an encounter with &#x27;the devil Warwick&#x27;. 

He fought in Scotland as captain of the army against the Scots in 1337 at the age of 24. He also fought in the Hundred Years Wars with France, commanding the English victory at the Battle of Crécy in 1346.

==Early life==

Thomas de Beauchamp was born at Warwick Castle, Warwickshire, England to Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick and Alice de Toeni. He served in Scotland frequently during the 1330s, being captain of the army against the Scots in 1337. He was hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire from 1333 until his death (in 1369). In 1344, he was also made High Sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire for life. 

==Victor at Crécy and Poitiers==

Warwick was Marshal of England from 1343/4 until 1369, and was one of the commanders at the great English victories at Crécy and Poitiers, as well as the Siege of Calais (1346).

Thomas de Beauchamp fought in all the French wars of King Edward III; he commanded the centre at the Battle of Crecy (where many of his relatives were killed, including his younger half-brother Alan la Zouche de Mortimer). He was trusted to be guardian of the sixteen-year-old Black Prince. 

He began the rebuilding of the Collegiate Church of Saint Mary in Warwick, supposedly using money received from the ransom of the archbishop of Sens, whom he captured at Poitiers, but that is an oversimplification.

==Marriage and children==
He married Katherine Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. They had six sons and ten daughters:
* Guy de Beauchamp (died 28 April 1360); married Philippa de Ferrers, daughter of Henry de Ferrers, 2nd Lord Ferrers of Groby, and Isabel de Verdun, by whom he had two daughters: Elizabeth (died c. 1369), and Katherine, who became a nun. His daughters were, by entail, excluded from their grandfather&#x27;s inheritance.
*Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick (16 March 13398 August 1401), married Margaret Ferrers, daughter of William Ferrers, 3rd Lord of Groby, and Margaret de Ufford, by whom he had issue, including Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick.
* Reinbrun de Beauchamp (died 1361)
* William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny (c. 13438 May 1411); inherited the honour of Abergavenny. On 23 July 1392, married Lady Joan FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel and Lady Elizabeth de Bohun, by whom he had a son, Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester, and a daughter, Joan de Beauchamp, Countess of Ormond. Queen consort Anne Boleyn was a notable descendant of the latter.
* Roger de Beauchamp (died 1361)
* Maud de Beauchamp (died 1403); married Roger de Clifford, 5th Baron de Clifford, by whom she had issue, including Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford.
* Philippa de Beauchamp; married Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, by whom she had nine children.
* Alice Beauchamp (died 1383); married firstly John Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp of Somerset, and secondly Sir Matthew Gournay. She died childless.
* Joan de Beauchamp; married Ralph Basset, 3rd Baron Basset of Drayton. She died childless.
* Isabel de Beauchamp (died 29 September 1416); married firstly John le Strange, 5th Baron Strange by whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth (1373-1383), and secondly, William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. Upon the latter&#x27;s death, she became a nun. She died without living issue.
* Margaret de Beauchamp; married first Guy de Montfort. This marriage was childless. After his death in 1261, she became a nun until 1269.
* Elizabeth de Beauchamp; married Thomas de Ufford KG.
* Anne de Beauchamp; married Walter de Cokesey.
* Juliana de Beauchamp
* Katherine de Beauchamp; became a nun at Shouldham Priory.
* Ramburne de Beauchamp; had one issue named Eleanora.

Catherine Grandison, Countess of Salisbury was not his daughter, although she is presented as such in William Painter&#x27;s &quot;Palace of Pleasure&quot; and in the Elizabethan play &quot;Edward III&quot;, which may be by William Shakespeare.

==Death==
Beauchamp&#x27;s wife Katherine died on 4 August 1369. Beauchamp died three months later at Calais aged 56, on 13 November 1369, of the Black Death and was buried alongside his wife in the chancel of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Warwick, Warwickshire.

<text>Bioremediation broadly refers to any process wherein a biological system (typically bacteria, microalgae, fungi in mycoremediation, and plants in phytoremediation), living or dead, is employed for removing environmental pollutants from air, water, soil, flue gasses, industrial effluents etc., in natural or artificial settings. The natural ability of organisms to adsorb, accumulate, and degrade common and emerging pollutants has attracted the use of biological resources in treatment of contaminated environment. In comparison to conventional physicochemical treatment methods bioremediation may offer advantages as it aims to be sustainable, eco-friendly, cheap, and scalable.

Most bioremediation is inadvertent, involving native organisms. Research on bioremediation is heavily focused on stimulating the process by inoculation of a polluted site with organisms or supplying nutrients to promote their growth. Environmental remediation is an alternative to bioremediation.

While organic pollutants are susceptible to biodegradation, heavy metals cannot be degraded, but rather oxidized or reduced. Typical bioremediations involves oxidations. Oxidations enhance the water-solubility of organic compounds and their susceptibility to further degradation by further oxidation and hydrolysis. Ultimately biodegradation converts hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water. For heavy metals, bioremediation offers few solutions. Metal-containing pollutant can be removed, at least partially, with varying bioremediation techniques. The main challenge to bioremediations is rate: the processes are slow.

Bioremediation techniques can be classified as (i) &quot;in situ&quot; techniques, which treat polluted sites directly, vs (ii) &quot;ex situ&quot; techniques which are applied to excavated materials. In both these approaches, additional nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and pH buffers are added to enhance the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms. In some cases, specialized microbial cultures are added (biostimulation). Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, bioventing, bioattenuation, biosparging, composting (biopiles and windrows), and landfarming. Other remediation techniques include thermal desorption, vitrification, air stripping, bioleaching, rhizofiltration, and soil washing. Biological treatment, bioremediation, is a similar approach used to treat wastes including wastewater, industrial waste and solid waste. The end goal of bioremediation is to remove harmful compounds to improve soil and water quality.

== &quot;In situ&quot; techniques ==
=== Bioventing ===
Bioventing is a process that increases the oxygen or air flow into the unsaturated zone of the soil, this in turn increases the rate of natural &quot;in situ&quot; degradation of the targeted hydrocarbon contaminant. Bioventing, an aerobic bioremediation, is the most common form of oxidative bioremediation process where oxygen is provided as the electron acceptor for oxidation of petroleum, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenols, and other reduced pollutants. Oxygen is generally the preferred electron acceptor because of the higher energy yield and because oxygen is required for some enzyme systems to initiate the degradation process. Microorganisms can degrade a wide variety of hydrocarbons, including components of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and jet fuel. Under ideal aerobic conditions, the biodegradation rates of the low- to moderate-weight aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic compounds can be very high. As molecular weight of the compound increases, the resistance to biodegradation increases simultaneously. This results in higher contaminated volatile compounds due to their high molecular weight and an increased difficulty to remove from the environment.

Most bioremediation processes involve oxidation-reduction reactions where either an electron acceptor (commonly oxygen) is added to stimulate oxidation of a reduced pollutant (e.g. hydrocarbons) or an electron donor (commonly an organic substrate) is added to reduce oxidized pollutants (nitrate, perchlorate, oxidized metals, chlorinated solvents, explosives and propellants). In both these approaches, additional nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and pH buffers may be added to optimize conditions for the microorganisms. In some cases, specialized microbial cultures are added (bioaugmentation) to further enhance biodegradation.

Approaches for oxygen addition below the water table include recirculating aerated water through the treatment zone, addition of pure oxygen or peroxides, and air sparging. Recirculation systems typically consist of a combination of injection wells or galleries and one or more recovery wells where the extracted groundwater is treated, oxygenated, amended with nutrients and re-injected. However, the amount of oxygen that can be provided by this method is limited by the low solubility of oxygen in water (8 to 10 mg/L for water in equilibrium with air at typical temperatures). Greater amounts of oxygen can be provided by contacting the water with pure oxygen or addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the water. In some cases, slurries of solid calcium or magnesium peroxide are injected under pressure through soil borings. These solid peroxides react with water releasing H2O2 which then decomposes releasing oxygen. Air sparging involves the injection of air under pressure below the water table. The air injection pressure must be great enough to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the water and resistance to air flow through the soil.

=== Biostimulation ===
Bioremediation can be carried out by bacteria that are naturally present. In biostimulation, the population of these helpful bacteria can be increased by adding nutrients.

Bacteria can in principle be used to degrade hydrocarbons. Specific to marine oil spills, nitrogen and phosphorus have been key nutrients in biodegradation. The bioremediation of hydrocarbons suffers from low rates.

Bioremediation can involve the action of microbial consortium. Within the consortium, the product of one species could be the substrate for another species.

Anaerobic bioremediation can in principle be employed to treat a range of oxidized contaminants including chlorinated ethylenes (PCE, TCE, DCE, VC), chlorinated ethanes (TCA, DCA), chloromethanes (CT, CF), chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, various energetics (e.g., perchlorate, RDX, TNT), and nitrate. This process involves the addition of an electron donor to: 1) deplete background electron acceptors including oxygen, nitrate, oxidized iron and manganese and sulfate; and 2) stimulate the biological and/or chemical reduction of the oxidized pollutants. The choice of substrate and the method of injection depend on the contaminant type and distribution in the aquifer, hydrogeology, and remediation objectives. Substrate can be added using conventional well installations, by direct-push technology, or by excavation and backfill such as permeable reactive barriers (PRB) or biowalls. Slow-release products composed of edible oils or solid substrates tend to stay in place for an extended treatment period. Soluble substrates or soluble fermentation products of slow-release substrates can potentially migrate via advection and diffusion, providing broader but shorter-lived treatment zones. The added organic substrates are first fermented to hydrogen (H2) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The VFAs, including acetate, lactate, propionate and butyrate, provide carbon and energy for bacterial metabolism.

=== Bioattenuation ===
During bioattenuation, biodegradation occurs naturally with the addition of nutrients or bacteria. The indigenous microbes present will determine the metabolic activity and act as a natural attenuation. While there is no anthropogenic involvement in bioattenuation, the contaminated site must still be monitored.

=== Biosparging ===
Biosparging is the process of groundwater remediation as oxygen, and possible nutrients, is injected. When oxygen is injected, indigenous bacteria are stimulated to increase rate of degradation. However, biosparging focuses on saturated contaminated zones, specifically related to ground water remediation.

UNICEF, power producers, bulk water suppliers, and local governments are early adopters of low cost bioremediation, such as aerobic bacteria tablets which are simply dropped into water.

== &quot;Ex situ&quot; techniques ==

=== Biopiles ===
Biopiles, similar to bioventing, are used to remove petroleum pollutants by introducing aerobic hydrocarbons to contaminated soils. However, the soil is excavated and piled with an aeration system. This aeration system enhances microbial activity by introducing oxygen under positive pressure or removes oxygen under negative pressure.

=== Windrows ===

Windrow systems are similar to compost techniques where soil is periodically turned in order to enhance aeration. This periodic turning also allows contaminants present in the soil to be uniformly distributed which accelerates the process of bioremediation.

=== Landfarming ===

Landfarming, or land treatment, is a method commonly used for sludge spills. This method disperses contaminated soil and aerates the soil by cyclically rotating. This process is an above land application and contaminated soils are required to be shallow in order for microbial activity to be stimulated. However, if the contamination is deeper than 5 feet, then the soil is required to be excavated to above ground. While it is an &quot;ex situ&quot; technique, it can also be considered an &quot;in situ&quot; technique as Landfarming can be performed at the site of contamination.

== &quot;In situ&quot; vs. &quot;Ex situ&quot; ==
&quot;Ex situ&quot; techniques are often more expensive because of excavation and transportation costs to the treatment facility, while i&quot;n situ&quot; techniques are performed at the site of contamination so they only have installation costs. While there is less cost there is also less of an ability to determine the scale and spread of the pollutant. The pollutant ultimately determines which bioremediation method to use. The depth and spread of the pollutantare other important factors.

==Heavy metals==
Heavy metals are introduced into the environment by both anthropogenic activities and natural factors. Anthropogenic activities include industrial emissions, electronic waste, and mining. Natural factors include mineral weathering, soil erosion, and forest fires. Heavy metals including cadmium, chromium, lead and uranium are unlike organic compounds and cannot be biodegraded. However, bioremediation processes can potentially be used to minimize the mobility of these material in the subsurface, lowering the potential for human and environmental exposure. Heavy metals from these factors are predominantly present in water sources due to runoff where it is uptake by marine fauna and flora.

Hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) and uranium (U[VI]) can be reduced to less mobile and/or less toxic forms (e.g., Cr[III], U[IV]). Similarly, reduction of sulfate to sulfide (sulfidogenesis) can be used to immobilize certain metals (e.g., zinc, cadmium).

The mobility of certain metals including chromium (Cr) and uranium (U) varies depending on the oxidation state of the material. Microorganisms can be used to lower the toxicity and mobility of chromium by reducing hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI) to trivalent Cr(III). Reduction of the more mobile U(VI) species affords the less mobile U(IV) derivatives. Microorganisms are used in this process because the reduction rate of these metals is often slow in the absence of microbial interactions Research is also underway to develop methods to remove metals from water by enhancing the sorption of the metal to cell walls. This approach has been evaluated for treatment of cadmium, chromium, and lead. Genetically modified bacteria has also been explored for use in sequestration of Arsenic. Phytoextraction processes concentrate contaminants in the biomass for subsequent removal.

Metal extractions can in principle be performed in situ or ex situ where in situ is preferred since it is less expensive to excavate the substrate.

Bioremediation is not specific to metals. In 2010 there was a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Populations of bacteria and archaea were used to rejuvenate the coast after the oil spill. These microorganisms over time have developed metabolic networks that can utilize hydrocarbons such as oil and petroleum as a source of carbon and energy. Microbial bioremediation is a very effective modern technique for restoring natural systems by removing toxins from the environment.

== Pesticides ==
Of the many ways to deal with pesticide contamination, bioremediation promises to be more effective. Many sites around the world are contaminated with agrichemicals. These agrichemicals often resist biodegradation, by design. Harming all manners of organic life with long term health issues such as cancer, rashes, blindness, paralysis, and mental illness. An example is Lindane which was a commonly used insecticide in the 20th century. Long time exposure poses a serious threat to humans and the surrounding ecosystem. Lindane reduces the potential of beneficial bacteria in the soil such as nitrogen fixation cyanobacteria. As well as causing central nervous system issues in smaller mammals such as seizures, dizziness, and even death. What makes it so harmful to these organisms is how quickly distributed it gets through the brain and fatty tissues. While Lindane has been mostly limited to specific use, it is still produced and used around the world.

Actinobacteria has been a promising candidate &quot;in situ&quot; technique specifically for removing pesticides. When certain strains of Actinobacteria have been grouped together, their efficiency in degrading pesticides has enhanced. As well as being a reusable technique that strengthens through further use by limiting the migration space of these cells to target specific areas and not fully consume their cleansing abilities. Despite encouraging results, Actinobacteria has only been used in controlled lab settings and will need further development in finding the cost effectiveness and scalability of use.

== Limitations of bioremediation ==
Bioremediation can be used to mineralize organic pollutants, to partially transform the pollutants, or alter their mobility. Heavy metals and radionuclides generally cannot be biodegraded, but can be bio-transformed to less mobile forms. In some cases, microbes do not fully mineralize the pollutant, potentially producing a more toxic compound. For example, under anaerobic conditions, the reductive dehalogenation of TCE may produce dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), which are suspected or known carcinogens. However, the microorganism &quot;Dehalococcoides&quot; can further reduce DCE and VC to the non-toxic product ethene. The molecular pathways for bioremediation are of considerable interest. In addition, knowing these pathways will help develop new technologies that can deal with sites that have uneven distributions of a mixture of contaminants.

Biodegradation requires microbial population with the metabolic capacity to degrade the pollutant. The biological processes used by these microbes are highly specific, therefore, many environmental factors must be taken into account and regulated as well. It can be difficult to extrapolate the results from the small-scale test studies into big field operations. In many cases, bioremediation takes more time than other alternatives such as land filling and incineration. Another example is bioventing, which is inexpensive to bioremediate contaminated sites, however, this process is extensive and can take a few years to decontaminate a site.&gt;

Another major drawback is finding the right species to perform bioremediation. In order to prevent the introduction and spreading of an invasive species to the ecosystem, an indigenous species is needed. As well as a species plentiful enough to clean the whole site without exhausting the population. Finally the species should be resilient enough to withstand the environmental conditions. These specific criteria may make it difficult to perform bioremediation on a contaminated site. 

In agricultural industries, the use of pesticides is a top factor in direct soil contamination and runoff water contamination. The limitation or remediation of pesticides is the low bioavailability. Altering the pH and temperature of the contaminated soil is a resolution to increase bioavailability which, in turn, increased degradation of harmful compounds.

The compound acrylonitrile is commonly produced in industrial setting but adversely contaminates soils. Microorganisms containing nitrile hydratases (NHase) degraded harmful acrylonitrile compounds into non-polluting substances.

Since the experience with harmful contaminants are limited, laboratory practices are required to evaluate effectiveness, treatment designs, and estimate treatment times. Bioremediation processes may take several months to several years depending on the size of the contaminated area.

== Genetic engineering ==
The use of genetic engineering to create organisms specifically designed for bioremediation is under preliminary research. Two category of genes can be inserted in the organism: degradative genes, which encode proteins required for the degradation of pollutants, and reporter genes, which encode proteins able to monitor pollution levels. Numerous members of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; have been modified with the &quot;lux&quot; gene for the detection of the polyaromatic hydrocarbon naphthalene. A field test for the release of the modified organism has been successful on a moderately large scale.

There are concerns surrounding release and containment of genetically modified organisms into the environment due to the potential of horizontal gene transfer. Genetically modified organisms are classified and controlled under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 under United States Environmental Protection Agency. Measures have been created to address these concerns. Organisms can be modified such that they can only survive and grow under specific sets of environmental conditions. In addition, the tracking of modified organisms can be made easier with the insertion of bioluminescence genes for visual identification.

Genetically modified organisms have been created to treat oil spills and break down certain plastics (PET).

== Additive manufacturing ==
Additive manufacturing technologies such as bioprinting offer distinctive benefits that can be leveraged in bioremediation to develop structures with characteristics tailored to biological systems and environmental cleanup needs, and even though the adoption of this technology in bioremediation is in its early stages, the area is seeing massive growth.

<text>The French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools bans wearing conspicuous religious symbols in French public (e.g., government-operated) primary and secondary schools. The law is an amendment to the French Code of Education that expands principles founded in existing French law, especially the constitutional requirement of &quot;laïcité&quot;: the separation of state and religious activities.
The bill passed France&#x27;s national legislature and was signed into law by President Jacques Chirac on 15 March 2004 (thus the technical name is law 2004-228 of 15 March 2004) and came into effect on 2 September 2004. The full title of the law is &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;Law #2004-228 of 15 March 2004, concerning, as an application of the principle of the separation of church and state, the wearing of symbols or garb which show religious affiliation in public primary and secondary schools&quot;).

The law does not mention any particular religious symbol, and thus bans Christian (veil, signs), Muslim (veil, signs), Sikh (turban, signs), Jewish (yarmulke, signs) and other religious signs. It is, however, considered by many to target the wearing of headscarves (a khimar, considered by many Muslims to be an obligatory article of faith as part of hijab) by Muslim schoolgirls. For this reason, it is occasionally referred to as the French headscarf ban in the foreign press. In addition, the law is seen by some as disproportionately affecting Muslims, arguing that Christians rarely wear oversized crosses, and Sikhs have successfully lobbied to be able to wear a simple under-turban, whereas Jews have greater opportunities to enroll children in private Jewish religious schools owing to their long presence in the country.
==Background==
===Islamic point of view on headscarves===
In Islam, Hijab is a duty prescribed on all Muslim women, though in the matter discussed in this article it only applies to women. Hijab is often equated with the idea of modesty in all senses including personal, physical and social. While it prescribes restrictions and practices for both men (such as, for example, restraining one&#x27;s thoughts from objectification of women and covering the aspects of oneself that attract others to them, incorporating the chest and between the navel and knee for many Muslims) and women, it is most known for its religious prescription for a woman to dress modestly and cover her hair.

While for most Muslims the concept of hijab is seen as balanced and consistent with ideas of gender equality, others see the religious prescription on female covering as chauvinistic, patriarchal, oppressive and an enforcement on women and against their rights. Most Muslims living in Western societies concede outright that the forcing of women to wear the headscarf is against Islamic precepts and cannot be accepted, but social pressure can in some cases be strong.

A number of Islamic feminists see the wearing of the headscarf, and particularly of the full-face veil such as the niqāb, as oppressive of women. French activist and politician Fadela Amara has thus stated: &quot;The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, secular spaces of France&#x27;s public school system.&quot;

===French education system===
Education is compulsory in France up to the age of 16. The French system of primary and secondary education consists of:
# government-operated schools (&quot;enseignement public&quot;);
# private schools receiving government subsidies (&quot;enseignement privé sous contrat&quot;), the vast majority of private schools; and
# private schools not receiving government subsidies (&quot;enseignement privé hors contrat&quot;).
Schools in the first two categories are required to apply the same national curricula as defined by the Ministry of Education. The curriculum for schools in the third category is free, provided that students receive at least some minimal skills in writing, mathematics, etc. The law discussed in this article only applies to government-operated schools, in the first category.

The French government highly subsidises private elementary and secondary schools, even those affiliated with religious organizations, as long as they apply the same curriculum as the public schools, with the same academic standards, and that they do not discriminate on grounds of religious affiliation nor make religious education compulsory. It is for instance common that children of agnostic or otherwise non-religious families, or children of families from other religions (including non-Catholic Christians), are put in Catholic schools, if their parents judge these schools to offer better conditions of education or to be more convenient. Consequently, families can use private schools at moderate costs. While there are no accessible official national statistics on the costs of private schools, typical prices per year for low-income families are in the range of a few hundred euros. The average costs are €500 a year per student; however, this statistic includes very expensive, exclusive schools. In addition, according to the figures from the secretariat, more than half of schools have established a price schedule taking into account a family&#x27;s income; as a result, costs to parents can be as little as €20 to €30 per school month per student.

In addition, the French government operates a distant learning agency, the CNED, which is another solution for families impacted by the normal rules or schedules of public schools.

===History===
Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. Schools directly operated by the national or local governments must not endorse or promote any religious dogma (whether endorsing an existing religion or endorsing atheism or any other philosophy). Schools funded totally or in part by the national and local governments by law must not force students into religious education; they should remain equally accessible to children of any, or no, faith. For example, even though a majority of the population nominally professes Catholicism (although far fewer regularly practice Catholicism), government-operated French schools have no communal prayers, religious assemblies, or Christian crosses on the walls. The Constitution of France says that France is a &quot;laïque&quot; (roughly, secular) Republic.
In France, historically, differences between religions (or later between religious and non-religious people) have often resulted in deep divisions of society, from the 16th-century Wars of Religion to the late 19th-century Dreyfus Affair. The relations between the Church of France and the state were disputed under Louis XIV (see Gallicanism); they were severely strained under the Revolution of 1789, when the constitutional government of the National Assembly promulgated the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the Church divided into the constitutional clergy, who accepted it, and the ultramontanes who did not. Roman Catholicism was recognised as the faith of the majority of French citizens, but Napoleon also named Judaism and the Lutheran and Reformed Churches as officially recognised by the state. Although these four &#x27;official&#x27; religions received state funding and protection (until the 1905 law as above), they were not given the status of a religion of the state. France had begun to view faith as a matter for each individual citizen rather than for a nation as a whole.

As a result of this history, religious manifestations are considered undesirable in government-operated schools; primary and secondary schools are supposed to be neutral spaces where children can learn away from political or religious pressures, controversies and quarrels. Because of this neutrality requirement, students are normally prohibited from conducting religious proselytising or political activism on the premises.

Civil servants are expected to stay neutral with respect to politics or religion when they discharge their duties. More generally, they are expected to keep a certain reserve and not make comments or demonstrations that may be interpreted as political, religious, or other bias in the course of their duties or as an endorsement of particular religious or partisan political views by the government. Teaching personnel in government-operated schools must not, by law, endorse any political or religious point of view; they may also face sanctions for wearing overt religious symbols.

===1980s and 1990s===

For many years school administrators have accepted, or tolerated, that schoolchildren wear symbols of their various religions, such as a Christian student wearing a cross, or a Jewish student wearing a kippah. However, there was some leeway and uncertainty in those matters, and occasionally some students faced disciplinary action for overly ostentatious attire.

Many people find crosses and yarmulkes acceptable, but not headscarves, for a variety of reasons. Some feminists do not consider them as religious symbols, but as symbols of female alienation, or dangerous signs of mounting &quot;communautarisme&quot; (ethnicisation of social relationships, which the French do not view favorably), rising Islamist movements, or attacks on the Republic, are sometimes deemed &#x27;foreign&#x27; and &#x27;un-French&#x27;. However, some people regard the wearing of headscarves as a feminist choice and do not view this as fundamentally different from other choices relating to clothing. The fact that most Muslims in France come from former French colonies has added a racist/antiracist tint to the debate. The issue has deeply divided France and debate has raged on ever since.

The issue of religion has wider implications than the mere wearing of headscarves, which contributed to the complexity of the debate. Occasionally, Muslim students have refused to attend certain classes when they or those influencing them deemed aspects of their faith to be contradicted (such as swimming classes or physical education); or insisted on attending them in Islamic garb, thus raising the question of whether this purported solution denatured the intended activity.

The wearing of the headscarf was also criticized as a means to enforce peer pressure on the girls not wearing it. One defense against this argument was that the ratio of Muslim girls to other girls was not always high in classrooms, and that scarf wearing did not necessarily reflect proselytizing intent; but a countervailing relevant issue was that the relevant group being pressured was Muslim girls not wearing the scarf, who could sometimes be endangered inside or outside school unless they submitted to wearing the scarf like their classmates.

Because of the absence of unambiguous law, action was taken on a case-by-case basis against students wearing ostensible religious garb, with differences of practice between establishments. School administrators, in such cases, were taken into legal, social and media quarrels far beyond their ordinary responsibilities. This was highlighted by the 1989 &quot;Affaire du Foulard&quot; (&quot;the headscarf affair&quot;), when three young girls were expelled from their school in Creil, near Paris, for refusing to take off their headscarves. This caused such an uproar that administrators realized something had to be done soon to regain control.

Because of these difficulties, public powers sought a more consistent approach. In 1989, the Minister of Education requested the legal analysis of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; on the issue of whether or not school administrators could, or should, expel students for wearing religious symbols, within the current framework of applicable regulations, laws, constitutional rights and international conventions. The general assembly of the &quot;Conseil&quot; gave a detailed analysis, containing the following opinion:
It results from the above that, in teaching establishments, the wearing by students of symbols by which they intend to manifest their religious affiliation is not by itself incompatible with the principle of laïcité, as it constitutes the free exercise of freedom of expression and of manifestation of religious creeds, but that this freedom should not allow students to sport signs of religious affiliation that, due to their nature, or the conditions in which they are worn individually or collectively, or due to their ostentatious and provocative character, would constitute an act of pressure, provocation, proselytism or propaganda, or would harm the dignity or the freedom of the student or other members of the educative community, or would compromise their health or safety, or would perturb the educational activities or the education role of the teaching personnel, or would trouble public order in the establishment or the normal functioning of the public service.

On 2 November 1992, the &quot;Conseil&quot; ruled that a school regulation prohibiting all philosophical or religious signs, including those that were worn, was excessively sweeping and against the principle of &quot;laïcité&quot;.

On 14 March 1994, the &quot;Conseil&quot; ruled that a school regulation prohibiting any headgear was excessive (the intent of this regulation was to prohibit the wearing of certain religious signs). The &quot;Conseil&quot; found that this regulation was excessively sweeping, without a clear need for it to be so.

On 10 March 1995, the &quot;Conseil&quot; upheld the expelling of three students from a highschool, on the basis that the three students gravely perturbed classes, infringing on school rules and the alleged prohibition of proselytism. One factor was the insistence of the students on wearing the scarf during sports classes, which was deemed inappropriate attire for such an activity. It also upheld some stipulations of the school regulations which restricted the wearing of signs of a religious, philosophical or political character, with the same legal analysis as the 1989 one cited above.

On 11 September 1995, three families appealed before the &quot;Conseil&quot; rulings of lower administrative courts, which had upheld decisions by high schools to exclude their daughters because they wore the veil; and the Minister of Education appealed rulings of lower courts that had declared illegal three exclusion decisions. The actual legal reasons differed slightly; however, in every case, on 27 November 1996, the &quot;Conseil&quot; ruled that the children had been inappropriately expelled, considering that the headscarf worn by the student, while it expressed the student&#x27;s religious beliefs, did not have a protest or ostentatious character, nor did wearing it constitute in any case an act of pressure or proselytism.

The opinion and the decisions of the &quot;Conseil&quot;, which established some kind of case law, still left a considerable margin of appreciation to school administrators, which led to many tensions and embarrassments. It was thus argued that clear and consistent rules should be enacted.

===Stasi commission&#x27;s report===

In July 2003, French President Jacques Chirac set up an investigative committee (&quot;commission Stasi&quot;) to examine how the principle of &quot;laïcité&quot; should apply in practice. It consisted of 20 people headed by Bernard Stasi, then ombudsman of France (&quot;médiateur de la République&quot;). While an obvious focus of the commission was wearing religious attire in public schools, the commission noted in its report that the issues went further.

The Stasi Commission published its report on 11 December 2003, considering that ostentatious displays of religion violated the secular rules of the French school system. The report recommended a law against pupils wearing &quot;conspicuous&quot; signs of belonging to a religion, meaning any visible symbol meant to be easily noticed by others. Prohibited items would include headscarves for Muslim girls, yarmulkes for Jewish boys, and turbans for Sikh boys. The Commission recommended allowing the wearing of discreet symbols of faith such as small crosses, Stars of David or Fatima&#x27;s hands.

The Senate commission based its report on multiple sources: school representatives, headmasters, teachers; political associations, such as Ni Putes Ni Soumises or SOS Racisme; representatives of the main religions; or leaders of human-rights organizations.
The Commission&#x27;s report emphasised that publicly funded schools in France should transmit knowledge, teach students critical awareness, assure autonomy and openness to cultural diversity, and encourage personal development. Schooling aims both to train students for a professional career, and to make them into good citizens of the French Republic. The report states that such a mission presupposes fixed common rules, like gender equality and respect for secularity.

Most of the debate has centered on hijab – the Islamic dress code, which may include a headscarf for women, but more generally, on the wearing of religious or political symbols in schools. The wearing of headscarves in school started comparatively recently in mainland France (since the late 1980s), and has become the focus of the conflict. The increasing number of visible headscarves has been attributed by some to a rise in extremist activity in France, in particular in poor immigrant suburbs. However intellectuals such as Xavier Ternisien of Le Monde Diplomatique have maintained that the indubitable rise in religious observance is not linked with Islamic extremism, but with the frustration of children of immigrants no longer accepting to remain invisible as their parents often were. Further it is often associated with the idea of Muslim communities feeling settled and established in, and thus a part of, in French society such that they feel comfortable in expressing their identity.

The Commission identified the following positions with regard to wearing the Muslim headscarf:
* For those wearing it, the headscarf can have different meanings. The wearers may have exercised a free personal choice to wear the headscarf; or external pressure may have forced them to do so. Most French people find this idea of constraint or pressure particularly intolerable when it relates to young girls (some girls start wearing a headscarf before the age of 11).

The purpose of dressing according to hijab varies from person to person. Some women see the headscarf as a way to preserve their modesty and prevent any sexual attractions as in western countries. Some see it as a form of liberation above the sexualisation and consumerism of modern society. Others see it as a patriarchal article intended to keep women hidden and subservient.

The representatives of the main religions and leaders of human rights organisations have expressed several objections to a law banning the wearing of religious symbols. They believe it will lead to the stigmatisation of Muslims, exacerbate anti-religious sentiment, promote the image of a France that restricts personal freedom, and encourage Muslim girls to drop out of schools if they feel forced to choose between schooling and their faith.

The Commission said that the Republic must clarify this situation.

A section of the report which received less media attention recommended that the school system make Yom Kippur and &quot;Eid&quot; (festival) into vacation days each year: currently, only some Christian holidays are vacation days (see Holidays in France); students who want to celebrate other festivities have to take some work day off with the authorisation of their parents. However, for critics and Muslims this did not balance out affairs: the banning of Muslim girls from freely choosing to wear an article of faith, seen by them as a religious obligation, could not be balanced with the permission to celebrate a religious festival, which is not obligatory at all.

The report also recommended enacting a ban on conspicuous symbols of political affiliation. The French National Assembly has not taken up these proposals.

The Commission also noted that occasionally pupils refuse to attend school because of the presence of teachers of the opposite sex, or refuse to attend certain classes (such as gymnastics or swimming lessons). The Commission suggested that only schools or state-recognised doctors (not simply parents) should have the right to grant exemptions.

==Law creation and interpretations==
In December 2003, President Jacques Chirac decided to act on the part of the Stasi report which recommended banning conspicuous religious symbols from schools. This meant that the legislature could adopt the recommendations, according to the emergency procedure, in January or February, ready for application at the start of the next school year in September 2004.

On 10 February 2004, the lower house voted by a large majority (494 for, 36 against, 31 abstentions) in support of the ban, which includes the caveat that the ban will be reviewed after it has operated for one year.

The initiators of the law are said to have particularly targeted two items of clothing: the headscarf and the veil (French: &quot;foulard&quot; and &quot;voile&quot; respectively); however the law mentions neither and just addresses &quot;ostentatious&quot; (&quot;conspicuous&quot;) symbols. Because of its terse, broad, vague terms, the law will leave a lot of its interpretation to the administrative and judicial authorities.

The headscarf (sometimes referred to as the hijab in both French and English) covers the hair, ears, neck, and sometimes the shoulders, but not the face. Most Muslim girls who cover their heads in school wear such a headscarf. More rarely, girls may also wear a complete dress covering their body (&quot;djelbab&quot;). The full or Afghan burka, which covers the entire body except for a slit or grille to see through, occurs more commonly as the dress of an adult woman than that of a schoolgirl. A recent controversy occurred when a mother who wore a full burka became a representative of parents in a city school. Rather than encourage public participation of such women, her participation in school deliberations while entirely covered was highly criticised. It was finally tolerated.

In order to enforce the law, effective decisions whether certain items are &quot;ostentatious&quot; or not will have to be taken. In order to achieve that:
* the Minister of Education will issue &quot;circulaires&quot;, or instructions for its services; it seems that large crosses, full hijabs or yarmulkes would be banned, while small symbols such as small Stars of David or crosses in pendants would not be;
* headmasters will have to judge whether particular attire is or not acceptable with respect to the law;
* if necessary, families will go to administrative courts to challenge the school authorities&#x27; decision; a final decision may not be reached until the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; at litigation (supreme administrative court), decides some points of jurisprudence.
The law itself may not be challenged before French courts (since this would have warranted action before the Constitutional Council before the signing of the law); however, the courts may significantly curtail its application — especially given the inherent margin of appreciation of what is ostentatious or not.

The law will apply in France and its overseas territories (which France administers as a part of its metropolitan territory), but it is likely that appropriate enforcement measures will depend on the local context, given the margin of appreciation offered by the law. Overseas Countries and Territories with a large Muslim community will receive some exemptions. For example, it was suggested that Mayotte girls may wear small bandanas and light veils (&quot;kishall&quot;).

==Public reaction==
===France===
The proposed ban was extremely controversial, with both sides of the political spectrum being split on the issue.

In 2004, French Cardinal Bernard Panafieu, the Archbishop of Marseilles called the ban &quot;unenforceable&quot;. While agreeing that some Muslim immigrants have had trouble adjusting to a &quot;lay, pluralistic society&quot; he asserted that the ban was wrong as it prevented Muslims from &quot;asserting their identity&quot; and that it would be &quot;better to act through persuasion than by compulsion&quot; if the state wanted to limit the use of religious symbols.

====Population====
On 14 February 2004, the Associated Press reported that &quot;Thousands of people, many of them women wearing headscarves, marched in France ... to protest a law banning the Islamic coverings and other religious apparel in public schools.&quot;

Polls suggest that a large majority of the French favour the ban. A January 2004 survey for Agence France-Presse showed 78% of teachers in favour. A February 2004 survey by CSA for &quot;Le Parisien&quot; showed 69% of the population for the ban and 29% against. For Muslims in France, the February survey showed 42% for and 53% against. Among surveyed Muslim women, 49% approved the proposed law, and 43% opposed it.

Complex reasons may influence why an individual either supports or opposes this amendment. They range from ensuring sex equality, preventing girls from being pressured into wearing the headscarf, boys into wearing turbans (for example), or a desire to see the Muslim community assimilated into French society on the one hand; to uphold freedoms of expression or conscience or religion, preventing the state from imposing restrictions on what a person can or cannot wear, preventing state victimisation of a minority group and opposing what may be seen as discrimination against Muslims on the other.

====Political reactions====
While all major political parties were somewhat divided on the issue, all major parties (the majority UMP and UDF, the opposition PS) supported the law.

However, André Victor, member of Workers&#x27; Struggle wrote in his article &quot;Islamic Hijab and the Subjugation of Women&quot; 25 April 2003 that &quot;Sarkozy has spoken out against hijab on passport photos, and presumably earned the approval of millions of voters, which was probably the real purpose of this exercise in demagoguery[...] Therefore, this policy leads to increase the weight of the most reactionary religious authorities within the immigrant population.&quot;

====Legal arguments====
Some critics have raised a legal point: they see the law as incompatible with the European convention on fundamental human rights. The Stasi Commission responded: &quot;The European Court in Strasbourg protects laïcité when it is a fundamental value of the State. It allows limits to the freedom of expression in public services, especially when it is a matter of protecting minors against external pressures.&quot; The Commission considers that the expression of an individual&#x27;s religion in the French state has to comply with the basic rules regarding the secular nature of the state and has to comply with the requirements of equality between the sexes and the safeguarding of the rights of minors. Similar debates on the education of girls in headscarves have long raged in secular-yet-Muslim Turkey; the European Court of Human Rights upheld the laws of Turkey, which are more restrictive than the French law; it therefore seems highly unlikely it would declare the French law contrary to the Convention.

Another piece of legal criticism is that a full-fledged law was not needed to enforce a measure that basically amounts to a new set of school regulations. Any binding document of lesser value (such as a &quot;décret&quot; or an &quot;arrêté ministeriel&quot;) would have had a similar effect. Since the writing of the Napoleonic Code, a principle of French law has been that it must be, in the words of the great legislator Portalis, &quot;general and abstract.&quot; Critics therefore argue that, by legislating on issues that could be solved with texts other than laws, the French legislature lowers the values of the law in general. Article 34 of the Constitution of France vests power in Parliament to legislate on the &quot;fundamental principles of teaching&quot;, leaving the application of these principles to the executive branch. By legislating on such minutiae, the argument goes, Parliament may have overstepped the &quot;domain of the law&quot; (&quot;domaine de la loi&quot;) that is set out by the Constitution only for the sake of pleasing the media and some interest groups.
However, a counter-argument is that the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, ruling according to current statute law, considered that sweeping prohibitions of religious attire or headgear by administrative authorities was contrary to law.

===Opposition===
==== Human rights NGOs ====
Some international human rights&#x27; organisations criticised the law. Human Rights Watch stated:
The proposed law is an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious practice. For many Muslims, wearing a headscarf is not only about religious expression, it is about religious obligation.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said:
In February 2004, the Commission issued a public statement expressing concern over the proposed new law. The Commission expressed particular concern that the proposed restrictions may violate France&#x27;s international human rights commitments. The Commission also stated that though increased immigration in France in recent years has created new challenges for the French government, including integration of these immigrants into French society as well as problems of public order, these challenges should be addressed directly, and not by inappropriately limiting the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and belief. The French government&#x27;s promotion of its understanding of the principle of secularism should not result in violations of the internationally recognized individual right to freedom of religion or belief.

In 2012, the United Nations Human Rights Committee stated that the expulsion of a Sikh pupil from his school in 2008 because of his Sikh turban or keski was a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights signed by France.

==== Jihadists ====
Several members of Al-Qaeda criticized the law: Ayman al-Zawahiri criticized the law in 2004 and considered it to be part of an ongoing campaign against Islam by &quot;Crusaders&quot;, Abu Mus’ab al-Zarqawi criticized the law in 2005. In 2009 Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb called France the &quot;mother of all evils&quot; and urged revenge against France for its “fierce war on our daughters who wore Hijab”.

====International====
Various commentators outside of France condemned the law based on what they saw as its racist implications. Susan Price, an Australian activist, argued that &quot;the wedge-politics of racism has always been used to divide the working class, which in France pulled off spectacular rolling strikes against the government in 2003,&quot; adding that &quot;the current attack must also be seen as part of a continuum of racist policies which go back to the mid-1990s and the &#x27;Fortress Europe&#x27; policies of the major European capitalist governments&quot; designed &quot;to appeal to the support base of Jean-Marie Le Pen’s right-wing National Front (FN).&quot;

Similar arguments were made at the time by American anti-racist activist, Sharon Smith, who added the claim that Muslim women in France opposing the 2004 law were fighting against the same &quot;state-imposed oppression&quot; as women in Afghanistan were opposing by seeking freedom to choose to refrain from wearing burkas.

==Enforcement==
The law came into effect on 2 September 2004, with the new school year. In September 2005, the Ministry of Education reported that only 12 students showed up with distinctive religious signs in the first week of classes, compared to 639 in the preceding year. A number of students have elected to take state-provided distance-learning classes from CNED. There was one case of a Sikh student in the &quot;académie&quot; of Créteil, who refused to remove his turban.

The decision caused an outcry from many Muslims across the world, calling it a violation of freedom of practicing their religion. In addition to protests of a few thousand people in Paris, there were protests of up to a few hundred people in other countries, especially in the Muslim world.

As a consequence of the law, the years following the ban has seen an increasing number of Islamic secondary schools being established, some Muslim female students chose to study at home, and others left France with their families.

==Interpretation==

In some schools, the ban was also applied to long skirts and headbands, or anything else that the school thought suggested expression of a religious identity. There are intentionally no specific rules, sometimes resulting in arbitrary interpretations by individual school employees. According to Luc Ferry, the Minister of National Education when the law was passed, the schools were empowered to prohibit anything, even hairstyles or wearing clothing of a color that the school decided had a religious meaning. Between January 2014 and April 2015, the Collective Against Islamophobia in France documented 130 cases of schools across France objecting to girls&#x27; clothing, mostly involving longer skirts, but also cases involving headbands that school officials said were too wide, or sweaters.

In April 2015, a 15-year-old schoolgirl in northeastern France was sent home for wearing a plain black maxi skirt, a white shirt, and a pale pink sweater to school, with no head scarf. The school deemed wearing a long skirt to be a &quot;provocation&quot; and an &quot;ostentatious sign&quot; of her religion, especially since several other girls had worn maxi skirts recently, and sent her home to change clothes. This incident caused worldwide controversy and infuriated many of the country&#x27;s Muslims, who saw the school system&#x27;s punishment of the girl as racially and religiously discriminatory.

== Abaya ban ==
France banned Muslim girls in state schools from wearing abayas. In August 2023, French education minister, Gabriel Attal, said that the long, flowing dresses worn by some Muslim women, would be banned as they breached the &quot;principle of secularism&quot;, particularly by those pupils &quot;wearing religious attire like abayas and long shirts.”

On 4 September, first day of the new academic year, French schools sent 67 Muslim girls to home for refusing to remove their abayas.

On 5 September, a 15-year-old girl living in the French City of Lyon reached school wearing jeans, T-shirt and an open Kimono - a common and popular traditional Japanese garment. The school however denied her entry. On behalf of the girl student, Human rights lawyer Nabil Boudi on September 22, 2023 lodged a complaint in the United Nations alleging racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, over “discrimination the girl student faced on the grounds of her religious affiliation&quot;.

<text>A fell (from Old Norse &quot;fell&quot;, &quot;fjall&quot;, &quot;mountain&quot;) is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain or moor-covered hill. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, Iceland, the Isle of Man, parts of northern England, and Scotland.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;fell&quot; comes from Old Norse &quot;fell&quot; and &quot;fjall&quot; (both forms existed). It is cognate with Danish &quot;fjeld&quot;, Faroese &quot;fjall&quot; and &quot;fjøll&quot;, Icelandic &quot;fjall&quot; and &quot;fell&quot;, Norwegian &quot;fjell&quot; with dialects &quot;fjøll&quot;, &quot;fjødd&quot;, &quot;fjedd&quot;, &quot;fjedl&quot;, &quot;fjill&quot;, &quot;fil(l)&quot;, and &quot;fel&quot;, and Swedish &quot;fjäll&quot;, all referring to mountains rising above the alpine tree line.

== British Isles ==


In northern England, especially in the Lake District and in the Pennine Dales, the word &quot;fell&quot; originally referred to an area of uncultivated high ground used as common grazing usually on common land and above the timberline. Today, generally, &quot;fell&quot; refers to the mountains and hills of the Lake District and the Pennine Dales.

Names that originally referred to grazing areas have been applied to these hilltops. This is the case with Seathwaite Fell, for example, which would be the common grazing land used by the farmers of Seathwaite. The fellgate marks the road from a settlement onto the fell (see photograph for example), as is the case with the Seathwaite Fell. In other cases the reverse is true; for instance, the name of Wetherlam, in the Coniston Fells, though understood to refer to the mountain as a whole, strictly speaking refers to the summit; the slopes have names such as Tilberthwaite High Fell, Low Fell and Above Beck Fells.
The word &quot;fell&quot; is also used in the names of various breeds of livestock, bred for life on the uplands, such as Rough Fell sheep, Fell terriers and Fell ponies.

It is also found in many place names across the north of England, often attached to the name of a community; thus the township of Cartmel Fell.

In northern England, there is a Lord of the Fells – this ancient aristocratic title being associated with the Lords of Bowland.

Groups of cairns are a common feature on many fells, often marking the summit – there are fine examples on Wild Boar Fell in Mallerstang Dale, Cumbria, and on Nine Standards Rigg just outside Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria.

As the most mountainous region of England, the Lake District is the area most closely associated with the sport of fell running, which takes its name from the fells of the district. &quot;Fellwalking&quot; is also the term used locally for the activity known in the rest of Great Britain as hillwalking.

The word &quot;fell&quot; also enjoys limited use in Scotland; with, for example, the Campsie Fells in central Scotland, to the north-east of Glasgow. One of the most famous examples of the use of the word &quot;fell&quot; in Scotland is Goat Fell, the highest point on the Isle of Arran. Criffel and the nearby Long Fell in Galloway may be seen from the northern Lake District of England. Peel Fell in the Kielder Forest is on the border between the Scottish Borders to the north and the English county of Northumberland to the south.

== Fennoscandia ==

===Norway===
In Norway, &quot;fjell&quot;, in common usage, is generally interpreted as simply a summit or area of greater altitude than a hill, which leads to a great deal of local variation in what is defined as a &quot;fjell&quot;. Fjell is mostly used about areas above the forest line. Distinct summits can be referred to as &quot;et fjell&quot; (a mountain). High plateaus (&quot;vidde&quot; landscape) such as Hardangervidda are also regarded as fjell. Professor of geography at the University of Bergen, Anders Lundeberg, has summed up the problem by stating, &quot;There simply is no fixed and unambiguous definition of &quot;fjell&quot;.&quot; Ivar Aasen defined &quot;fjell&quot; as a &quot;tall &quot;, primarily referring to a &quot;berg&quot; that reaches an altitude where trees do not grow, lower &quot;berg&quot; are referred to as &quot;berg&quot;, &quot;ås&quot; (hill, ridge) or &quot;hei&quot; (moor, heathland). The fixed expression &quot;til fjells&quot; refers to mountains (or uplands) as a collective rather than a specific location or specific summit (the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;til fjells&quot; is an old genitive form remaining only in fixed expressions). According to Ivar Aasen, &quot;berg&quot; refers to cliffs, bedrock and notable elevations of the surface underpinned by bedrock; &quot;berg&quot; also refers to the substance of bedrock. For all practical purposes, &quot;fjell&quot; can be translated as &quot;mountain&quot; and the Norwegian language has no other commonly used word for mountain.

In Sweden, &quot;fjäll&quot; generally refers to any mountain or upland high enough that forest will not naturally survive at the top, in effect a mountain tundra. &quot;Fjäll&quot; is primarily used to describe mountains in the Nordic countries, but also more generally to describe mountains shaped by massive ice sheets, primarily in Arctic and subarctic regions. There are however dialectal differences in usage, with comparatively low mountains or plateaus, sometimes tree-covered, in Bohuslän and Västergötland (e.g. and ) being referred to as &quot;fjäll&quot;, similar to how the word is used in Norwegian 

===Finland===

In Finnish, the mountains characteristic of the region of Lapland are called &quot;tunturi&quot; (plural: &quot;tunturit&quot;), i.e. &quot;fell&quot;. A &quot;tunturi&quot; is a hill high enough that its top is above the tree line and has alpine tundra. In Finnish, the geographical term &quot;vuori&quot; is used for mountains recently uplifted and with jagged terrain featuring permanent glaciers, while &quot;tunturi&quot; refers to the old, highly eroded, gently shaped terrain without glaciers, as found in Finland. They are round inselbergs rising from the otherwise flat surroundings. The tree line can be at a rather low altitude, such as 600 m in Enontekiö, owing to the high latitude. The fells in Finnish Lapland form vestiges of the Karelides mountains, formed two billion years ago. The term &quot;tunturi&quot; is also generally used to refer to treeless plains at high altitudes in far north regions. The term &quot;tunturi&quot;, originally a word limited to far-Northern dialects of Finnish and Karelian, is a loan from Sami, compare Proto-Sami &quot;*tuontër&quot;, South Sami &quot;doedtere&quot;, Northern Sami &quot;duottar&quot;, Inari Sami &quot;tuodâr&quot; &quot;uplands, mountains, tundra&quot;, Kildin Sami &quot;tūndâr&quot;, which means &quot;uplands, treeless mountain tract&quot; and is cognate with Finnish &quot;tanner&quot; &quot;hard ground&quot;. From this Sami word, the word &quot;tundra&quot; is borrowed, as well, through the Russian language. Hills that are over 50 m high, but do not reach the tree line are referred to as &quot;vaara&quot;, while the general term for hills including hills of 50 m or less is &quot;mäki&quot;. In place names, however, &quot;tunturi&quot;, &quot;vaara&quot; and &quot;vuori&quot; are used inconsistently, e.g. Rukatunturi is technically a &quot;vaara&quot;, as it lacks alpine tundra.

===Förfjäll===

The term &quot;förfjäll&quot; (literally &quot;fore-fell&quot;) is used in Sweden and Finland to denote mountainous zones lower and less dissected than the fell proper. However, its more pronounced relief, its often higher amount of plateaux, and its coherent valley systems distinguishes the &quot;förfjäll&quot; also from the undulating hilly terrain (&quot;bergkullsterräng&quot;) and the plains with residual hills (&quot;bergkullslätt&quot;). Generally, the &quot;förfjäll&quot; do not surpass 1000 m ASL. As a geomorphic unit, the &quot;förfjäll&quot; extends across Sweden as a 650 km-long and 40 km to 80 km-broad belt from Dalarna in the south to Norrbotten in the north.

<doc id="434196" wikidata="Q6222916" url="?curid=434196" title="Tiburcio Vásquez">
<text>Tiburcio Vásquez (April 11, 1835 – March 19, 1875) was a Californio &quot;bandido&quot; who was active in California from 1854 to 1874. The Vasquez Rocks, north of Los Angeles, were one of his many hideouts and are named after him.

== Early life ==
Tiburcio Vásquez was born in Monterey, Alta California, Mexico (present-day California, United States) on April 11, 1835 to José Hermenegildo Vásquez and María Guadalupe Cantúa. In accordance with Spanish tradition, Vásquez&#x27;s birth was celebrated on the saint’s feast day of his namesake, St. Tiburtius; thus, he always referred to his birthday as August 11, 1835. His great-grandfather came to Alta California with the De Anza Expedition of 1776. He grew up in a moderately well-off, middle-class family who owned land, granted to them by the Mexican government, due to his father’s military service as a Spanish soldier. He spent plenty of time on his father’s and his Uncle Felipe Vásquez’s ranchos, learning the skills of ranching. He was noted as excellent in marksmanship and horsemanship from a young age. Vásquez was slightly built, and about . He flourished in Monterey’s early social scene, and he loved to attend the balls and dances that were popular in town. His family had sent him to a public school established by the government where he became proficient in both English and Spanish, an uncommon skill for the times.

By 1852, Vásquez had become a protégé of Anastacio García, one of California&#x27;s most dangerous bandits. In 1854, Vásquez was present at the slaying of Monterey Constable William Hardmount, during a fight with García at a fandango. Vásquez denied any involvement in the murder, yet still fled, becoming an outlaw. With Alta California ceasing to exist (once becoming the U.S. state of California), and no longer under Mexican governance, thousands of settlers from states and territories further east arrived to claim land in California. This left many Mexicans feeling slighted and forgotten; Vásquez would later claim that his (eventual) crimes were retribution for discrimination by the settlers and white &quot;norteamericanos&quot; (‘North Americans’), insisting that he was a defender of Mexican-American rights. For the next 20 years, Vásquez and García played leading roles in Monterey County&#x27;s murderous Roach-Belcher feud, ending when García was executed by hanging in 1875.

== Northern California ==
In 1856, a sheriff&#x27;s posse caught up with Vásquez while he was rustling horses near Newhall, and he spent the next five years behind bars in San Quentin prison. There, Vásquez helped organize, and participated in, four bloody prison breaks which left twenty convicts dead. By 1866, he had committed numerous burglaries, cattle thefts, and highway robberies in Sonoma County. He was captured after a store burglary in Petaluma and sent to prison again for three years. His &quot;trademark&quot; was &quot;binding [his victims&#x27;] hands behind their back and leaving them face down in the dust.&quot;

In 1870, Vásquez organized a bandit gang, which included the notorious Juan Soto and, later, Procopio Bustamante. After numerous bandit raids, Vásquez was shot and badly wounded in a gunfight with Santa Cruz police officer Robert Liddell. Vásquez managed to escape, and his sisters nursed him back to health.

In 1873, he gained statewide, and then nationwide, notoriety. Vásquez and his gang stole $2,200 from Snyder&#x27;s Store in Tres Pinos, now called Paicines, in San Benito County. Three were killed, but not by Vásquez. Posses began searching for Vásquez, and Governor Newton Booth placed a $1,000 reward on his head. Sheriff John H. Adams from San Jose pursued the band to Southern California; Vásquez escaped after a gunfight.

== Southern California ==
Vásquez hid for a while in Southern California, where he was less well known. With his two most trusted men, he rode over the old Tejon Pass, through the Antelope Valley, and rested at Jim Hefner&#x27;s ranch at Elizabeth Lake. Vásquez&#x27;s brother, Francisco, lived nearby. After resting, Vásquez rode on to Littlerock Creek, which became his first Southern California hideout.

Vásquez was popular in the Mexican-American community, and had many friends and family members from Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south. He was handsome, literate and charming, played guitar, and was a skillful dancer. Women were attracted to him, and he had many love affairs. He enjoyed reading romantic novels and writing poetry for his female admirers. He had several affairs with married women, one of which eventually led to his downfall.

Vásquez returned to the San Joaquin Valley. On November 10, 1873, he and his gang robbed the Jones store at Millerton in Fresno County. On December 26, 1873, he and his band sacked the town of Kingston in Fresno County, robbing all the businesses and making off with $2,500 in cash and jewelry.

Governor Booth was now authorized by the California State Legislature to spend up to $15,000 to bring the law down on Vásquez. Posses were formed in Santa Clara, Monterey, San Joaquin, Fresno, and Tulare counties. In January 1874, Booth offered $3,000 for Vásquez&#x27;s capture alive, and $2,000 if he was brought back dead. These rewards were increased in February to $8,000 and $6,000, respectively. Alameda County Sheriff Harry Morse was assigned specifically to track down Vásquez.

Heading towards Bakersfield, Vásquez and gang member Clodoveo Chávez rode to the rock promontory near Inyokern now known as Robbers Roost. Near that spot, at Coyote Holes, they robbed a stagecoach from the Cerro Gordo Mines near Owens Lake of its silver. During the robbery Vásquez shot and wounded a man who did not obey his orders.

The gang moved to Elizabeth Lake and Soledad Canyon, robbing a stage coach of $300, stealing six horses and a wagon near present-day Acton, and robbing lone travelers. Vásquez was believed to be hiding out at what are now known as Vásquez Rocks. Shallow caves, deep crevices, and numerous overhangs created a maze for any posse to thread. The tallest rock, 150 feet (46 m) high, provided an excellent lookout point.

For the next two months, Vásquez escaped attention. However, he then made an error that led to his capture. On April 15, 1874, he and his band held the prominent sheepman Alessandro Repetto for ransom. Pursuing posses from Los Angeles almost trapped the gang in the San Gabriel Mountains, but once again, Vásquez and his men escaped.

== Arrest and execution ==

Vásquez took up residence at the adobe home of &quot;Greek George&quot; Caralambo in the northwest corner of Rancho La Brea, located 200 yards (183 m) south of the present-day Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. Greek George was a former camel driver for in the Army Camel Corps. Allegedly, Vásquez seduced and impregnated his own niece. Either the girl&#x27;s family or Greek George&#x27;s wife&#x27;s family betrayed Vásquez to Los Angeles County Sheriff William R. Rowland. Rowland sent a posse to the ranch and captured Vásquez on May 14, 1874. Greek George&#x27;s adobe was situated near the present-day Melrose Place in West Hollywood, very close to where the movie industry set up shop a few decades later.

Vásquez remained in the Los Angeles County jail for nine days. He had numerous requests for interviews by many newspaper reporters, but agreed to see only three: two from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and one from the &quot;Los Angeles Star&quot;. He told them his aim was to return California to Mexican rule. He insisted he was an honorable man and claimed he had never killed anyone.

In late May, Vásquez was moved by steamship to San Francisco. He eventually stood trial in San Jose. Vásquez quickly became a celebrity among many of his fellow Hispanic Californians. He admitted that he was an outlaw, but again denied he had ever killed anyone. A note purportedly written by Clodoveo Chávez, one of his gang members, was dropped into a Wells Fargo box. Chávez wrote that he, not Vásquez, had shot the men at Tres Pinos. Nevertheless, at his trial Vásquez admitted participating in the Tres Pinos raid. In January 1875, Vásquez was convicted and sentenced to hang for murder. His trial had taken four days and the jury deliberated for only two hours before finally finding him guilty of one count of murder in the Tres Pinos robbery.

Visitors still flocked to Vásquez&#x27;s jail cell, many of them women. He signed autographs and posed for photographs. Vásquez sold the photos from the window of his cell and used the money to pay for his legal defense. After his conviction, he appealed for clemency. It was denied by Governor Romualdo Pacheco. Vásquez calmly met his fate in San Jose on March 19, 1875. He was 39 years old.

== Legacy ==
Vásquez&#x27;s legacy has been subject to much debate over the ensuing decades since his execution. For quite a long time after his death, popular culture tended to regard Vásquez as a mere dangerous bandit of the Southwest. The Chicano Civil Rights Movement prompted the publication of Chicano scholarship and artistic works that challenged this notion and instead posited a more nuanced perspective on Vásquez as a victim of injustice and resistance fighter against Anglo-American discrimination. Chicano scholars and artists used Vásquez&#x27;s story as an example of the persistent anti-Californio discrimination following the Mexican-American War. To this day, many continue to visit and pay respects to Vásquez&#x27;s grave. He was buried in Santa Clara Mission Cemetery in Santa Clara, California.

With his refined manners, Californio background, and affection for the ladies, Vásquez is thought to have been one of several sources for the bandit-hero character Zorro.

The actor Anthony Caruso played Vásquez in &quot;Stories of the Century.&quot;

Armand Alzamora (1928–2009) played Vásquez in the 1957 episode, &quot;The Last Bad Man&quot; of the syndicated anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The segment focuses on Vásquez&#x27;s early life of crime, his hatred for the US takeover of California, the prison escape, and his hanging at the age of 39.

Vásquez was the main subject of a play by famous Chicano playwright and director Luis Valdez in his 1982 stage play &quot;Bandido!&quot; The play helped popularize the story of Tiburcio Vásquez to a new generation of young Chicanos and Chicanas in the latter 20th century. Through the lens of satire, Valdez uses the life story of Vásquez not just as a storytelling device to critique the traditional mythology of Manifest Destiny but also harmful stereotypes towards Mexican-Americans. As with Valdez’s other works, themes of poverty and discrimination against Californios like Vásquez are used to draw attention to the intergenerational socio-political problems that face the Chicano community to the current day.

In 1971, at the height of the Chicano Rights Movement, a coalition of local groups in Alameda California, including the Brown Berets, established a nonprofit health clinic named after Vásquez aimed at fighting health disparities among Chicano and migrant communities.

The trunk and knife that belonged to Vásquez are on display at the Andres Pico Adobe in Mission Hills, part of the San Fernando Valley Historical Society collection.

<doc id="434202" wikidata="Q261309" url="?curid=434202" title="Western white pine">
<text>Western white pine (Pinus monticola), also called silver pine and California mountain pine, is a species of pine in the family Pinaceae. It occurs in mountain ranges of northwestern North America and is the state tree of Idaho.

== Description ==
Western white pine is a large tree, regularly growing to tall. It is a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and long. The cones, appearing even on young trees, are long and slender, long and broad (closed), opening to broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, long, and have a long slender wing long.

The branches are borne in regular whorls, produced at the rate of one a year; this is pronounced in narrow, stand-grown trees, while open specimens may have a more rounded form with wide-reaching limbs. When mature, the tree has bark that appears to be cut into small, checkered units.

=== Similar species ===
It is related to the Eastern white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;), differing from it in having larger cones, slightly longer-lasting leaves (2–3 years, rather than 1.5–2 years) with more prominent stomatal bands, and a somewhat denser and narrower habit.

== Distribution ==
The species occurs in humid areas of the mountains of the Western United States and Western Canada such as the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade Range, the Coast Range, and the northern Rocky Mountains. It can be found in elevations of above sea level in eastern Washington and Oregon&#x27;s Blue Mountains and on the western face of the Sierra Nevada as far south as the headwaters of the Kern River. The tree often occurs in forests with fir and hemlock species, especially those which are tolerant of shade. It benefits from disturbances that clear away competing species, including low fires that do not destroy all of its cone-protected seeds. It is also well adapted to poor, rocky soils.

== Ecology ==
Once abundant in northern Idaho, Western white pine&#x27;s population was drastically affected from the late 19th century to the late 20th century by logging, wildfires, white pine blister rust, and a bark beetle epidemic. Since 1970, millions of Western white pine seedlings have been planted to make up for the losses.

The white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;) is a fungus that was accidentally introduced from Europe in 1909. The United States Forest Service estimates that 90% of the Western white pines have been killed by the blister rust west of the Cascades. Large stands have been succeeded by other pines or non-pine species. The rust has also killed much of the whitebark pine outside of California. Blister rust is less severe in California, and Western white and whitebark pines have survived there in great numbers.

Resistance to the blister rust is genetic; due to Western white pine&#x27;s genetic variability, some individuals are relatively unaffected. The Forest Service has a program for locating and breeding rust-resistant Western white pine and sugar pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild.

== Uses ==
The gum was reportedly chewed by Native Americans to treat coughs. The pitch was used to fasten arrowheads and coat fishing and whaling instruments. European colonists used both Western and Eastern white pine as softwood lumber. Both species are considered excellent for molding and carving. First the Eastern and then the Western species were used in the building of transcontinental railroads in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, white pine was used to build houses and make matches.

Western white pine is widely grown as an ornamental tree.

<doc id="434212" wikidata="Q93052" url="?curid=434212" title="Robert Fano">
<text>Roberto Mario &quot;Robert&quot; Fano (11 November 1917 – 13 July 2016) was an Italian-American computer scientist and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He became a student and working lab partner to Claude Shannon, whom he admired zealously and assisted in the early years of information theory.

==Early life and education==
Fano was born in Turin, Italy in 1917 to a Jewish family and grew up in Turin. Fano&#x27;s father was the mathematician Gino Fano, his older brother was the physicist Ugo Fano, and Giulio Racah was a cousin. Fano studied engineering as an undergraduate at the School of Engineering of Torino (Politecnico di Torino) until 1939, when he emigrated to the United States as a result of anti-Jewish legislation passed under Benito Mussolini. He received his S.B. in electrical engineering from MIT in 1941, and upon graduation joined the staff of the MIT Radiation Laboratory. After World War II, Fano continued on to complete his Sc.D. in electrical engineering from MIT in 1947. His thesis, titled &quot;Theoretical Limitations on the Broadband Matching of Arbitrary Impedances&quot;, was supervised by Ernst Guillemin.

==Career==
Fano&#x27;s career spans three areas, microwave systems, information theory, and computer science.

Fano joined the MIT faculty in 1947 to what was then called the Department of Electrical Engineering. Between 1950 and 1953, he led the Radar Techniques Group at Lincoln Laboratory. In 1954, Fano was made an IEEE Fellow for &quot;contributions in the field of information theory and microwave filters&quot;. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, to the National Academy of Engineering in 1973, and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978.

Fano was known principally for his work on information theory. He developed Shannon–Fano coding in collaboration with Claude Shannon, and derived the Fano inequality. He also invented the Fano algorithm and postulated the Fano metric.

In the early 1960s, Fano was involved in the development of time-sharing computers. From 1963 until 1968 Fano served as the founding director of MIT&#x27;s Project MAC, which evolved to become what is now known as the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He also helped to create MIT&#x27;s original computer science curriculum.

In 1976, Fano received the Claude E. Shannon Award for his work in information theory. In 1977 he was recognized for his contribution to the teaching of electrical engineering with the IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal.

Fano retired from active teaching in 1984, and died on 13 July 2016 at the age of 98.

==Bibliography==
In addition to his work in information theory, Fano also published articles and books about microwave systems, electromagnetism, network theory, and engineering education. His longer publications include:

*&quot;The Theory of Microwave Filters&quot; and &quot;The Design of Microwave Filters&quot;, chapters 9 and 10 in George L. Ragan, ed., &quot;Microwave Transmission Circuits&quot;, vol. 9 in the &quot;Radiation Laboratory Series&quot; (with A. W. Lawson, 1948).
*&quot;Electromagnetic Energy Transmission and Radiation&quot; (with Lan Jen Chu and Richard B. Adler, 1960).
*&quot;Electromagnetic Fields, Energy, and Forces&quot; (with Chu and Adler, 1960).

<doc id="434213" wikidata="Q2716721" url="?curid=434213" title="Up (film series)">
<text>The &quot;Up&quot; series of documentary films follows the lives of ten boys and four girls in England, beginning in 1964, when they were seven years old. The first film was titled &quot;Seven Up!&quot;, with later films adjusting the number in the title to match the age of the subjects at the time of filming. The documentary has had nine episodes—one every seven years—thus spanning 56 years. The series has been produced by Granada Television for ITV, which has broadcast all of them except &quot;42 Up&quot; (1998), which was broadcast on BBC One. Individual films and the series as a whole have received numerous accolades; in 1991, the then-latest installment, &quot;28 Up&quot;, was chosen for Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of the ten greatest films of all time.

The children were selected for the original programme to represent the range of socio-economic backgrounds in Britain at that time, on the assumption that each child&#x27;s social class would determine their future. The first instalment was made as a one-off edition of Granada Television&#x27;s series, &quot;World in Action&quot;, directed by Canadian Paul Almond, with involvement by &quot;a fresh-faced young researcher, a middle-class Cambridge graduate&quot;, Michael Apted, whose role in the initial programme included &quot;trawling the nation&#x27;s schools for 14 suitable subjects&quot;. About the first programme, Apted has said:It was Paul&#x27;s film ... but he was more interested in making a beautiful film about being seven, whereas I wanted to make a nasty piece of work about these kids who have it all, and these other kids who have nothing. After Almond&#x27;s direction of the original programme, director Michael Apted continued the series with new instalments every seven years, filming material from those of the fourteen who chose to participate. The aim of the continuing series is stated at the beginning of &quot;7 Up&quot; as: &quot;Why did we bring these together? Because we wanted a glimpse of England in the year 2000. The union leader and the business executive of the year 2000 are now seven years old.&quot; The most recent instalment, the ninth, titled &quot;63 Up&quot;, premiered in the UK on ITV in 2019. A special episode featuring celebrity fans of the series, &quot;7 Up &amp; Me&quot;, also aired on ITV in 2019. Apted is reported to have said, &quot;I hope to do &quot;84 Up&quot; when I&#x27;ll be 99&quot;; however, he died in 2021. There has been no confirmation that the series is concluded in the aftermath of Apted&#x27;s death, but there is also no known plan to film a &quot;70 Up&quot; entry for 2026 with a new director.

==Creation==
The first film in the series, &quot;Seven Up!&quot; (1964), was directed by Paul Almond, and was commissioned by Granada Television as a programme in the &quot;World in Action&quot; series. From &quot;7 Plus Seven&quot; until &quot;63 Up&quot; the films were directed by Michael Apted, who had been a researcher on &quot;Seven Up!&quot; and was involved in finding the original children, with Gordon McDougall. The premise of the film was taken from the Jesuit motto &quot;Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man&quot;. The 1998 edition, &quot;42 Up&quot;, was broadcast on BBC One but was still produced by Granada Television.

==List of films and premiere dates==
==Participants==
The subjects are first seen on a group visit to London Zoo in 1964, where the narrator announces &quot;We brought these 20 children together for the very first time.&quot; The series then follows fourteen of the children: Bruce Balden, Jackie Bassett, Symon Basterfield, Andrew Brackfield, John Brisby, Peter Davies, Susan Davis, Charles Furneaux, Nicholas Hitchon, Neil Hughes, Lynn Johnson, Paul Kligerman, Suzanne Lusk and Tony Walker.

The participants were chosen in an attempt to represent different social classes in Britain in the 1960s. Apted states in the &quot;42&quot; commentary track that he was asked to find children at the extremes. Because the show was not originally intended to become a repeating series, no long-term contract was signed with the participants. According to Apted, participants in the subsequent programmes since &quot;Seven Up!&quot; have been paid a sum for their appearance in each instalment, as well as equal parts of any prize the film may win. Each subject is filmed in about two days and the interview itself takes more than six hours.

Apted has said that it was a poor decision to include only four female participants.

===Andrew===
Andrew Brackfield was one of three boys chosen from the same pre-preparatory school in the wealthy London district of Kensington (the other two being Charles and John). The three are introduced in &quot;Seven Up!&quot; singing &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; in Latin. At the age of seven, when asked which newspaper he reads, if any, Andrew stated that he reads &quot;The Financial Times&quot; (although he later revealed he was in fact just repeating what his father had told him when asked the same question). All three could say which prep schools, public schools and universities they planned to attend (Oxford or Cambridge in all cases); two named the specific Oxbridge college they intended to join.

Andrew&#x27;s academic career culminated in his studying at Trinity College, Cambridge. Andrew subsequently became a solicitor, married and raised a family. He is the only one of the three Kensington boys to have appeared in all the &quot;Up&quot; films. Both Andrew and his wife, Jane, are most satisfied with how their children have turned out, followed by their relationship.

===Charles===
Charles Furneaux did not get into Oxford, saying in &quot;21&quot; he was glad to have avoided the &quot;prep school–Marlborough–Oxbridge conveyor belt&quot; by going to Durham University instead; however, he later attended Oxford as a post-graduate student. Charles has worked in journalism in varying capacities over the years, including as a producer for the BBC, and in the making of documentary films, including &quot;Touching the Void&quot;. When contacted to appear in &quot;28&quot;, Charles declined; a subsequent phone conversation during which Apted, by his own admission, &quot;went berserk&quot;, destroyed the relationship to the degree that Charles has refused to participate in all subsequent films, and even attempted to force Granada to remove archive images of him from the films in which he did not appear.

During an on-stage interview at London&#x27;s National Film Theatre in December 2005, Apted alleged that Charles had attempted to sue him when he refused to remove Charles from the archive sequences in &quot;49&quot;. Apted also commented on the irony that as a documentary maker himself, Charles was the only one who refused to continue.

By the time of &quot;63&quot;, all references to Charles have been removed save for fleeting glimpses of joint shots with Andrew and John.

===John===
John Brisby KC, who was vocal on politics by 14, attended Oxford and became a barrister. He married Claire, the daughter of Sir Donald Logan, a former ambassador to Bulgaria. Brisby devotes himself to charities related to Bulgaria, and hopes to reclaim family land there that had been nationalised. He is a great-great-grandson of the first Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Todor Burmov.

Brisby said in &quot;35&quot; that he only does the films to give more publicity to his chosen charities. In &quot;56&quot;, he criticised Apted&#x27;s decision to originally portray him as part of the &quot;privileged upper class&quot;. He disclosed that his father had died when he was 9 and his mother worked to put him through elite private schools; he had attended Oxford on a scholarship. In &quot;56&quot;, he remains a litigator who feels very blessed in almost all aspects of his life. In &quot;63&quot;, he refers to the series as a &quot;poison pill&quot; but also says he sees that it has value.

===Suzy===
Suzanne (Suzy) Lusk comes from a wealthy background and was first filmed at an independent London day school. Her parents divorced around the time of &quot;7 Plus Seven&quot;. She then dropped out of school at the age of 16, deciding to travel to Paris. By 21, she had formed a strong negative opinion about marriage and being a parent, though this soon changed dramatically. By &quot;28&quot;, she was married with two sons, and credited her marriage with bringing her the optimism and happiness that was not evident in the earlier films. Her husband, Sir Rupert Dewey, is a solicitor in Bath and they have three children, two boys and a girl. She became a bereavement counsellor. In &quot;7 Plus Seven&quot;, she stated that she thought Apted&#x27;s project was pointless and silly, a point that she restated in &quot;21&quot;. At &quot;49&quot;, she was convinced that she would not participate again, but in &quot;56&quot;, she admitted that she felt an obligation to the project regardless of how she feels about it. Suzy did not appear in &quot;63&quot; aside from footage from previous films.

===Jackie===
Jackie Bassett was one of three girls (the others being Lynn and Sue) who were chosen from the same primary school, in a working-class neighbourhood of east London. She eventually went to a comprehensive school and married at age 19. Jackie went through several different jobs, divorced, remarried and moved to Scotland, divorced again and raised her three sons as a single parent. As of &quot;56&quot;, she had been receiving disability benefit for 14 years, due to rheumatoid arthritis. Her family remains close and lives near each other in Scotland.

===Lynn===
Lynn Johnson, after attending the same primary school as Jackie and Sue, went on to attend a grammar school. She married at 19, had two daughters, and became a children&#x27;s librarian at 21. She later became a school librarian and remained in that position until being made redundant due to budget cuts. At &quot;56&quot;, she continued to believe her career as a librarian was of great value and it helped define her life. She was a doting grandmother with three grandchildren, and still married to her husband Russ, whom she considered her soulmate. In May 2013, after a short illness, Lynn became the first participant to die. She served as Chair of Governors of St Saviour&#x27;s primary school in Poplar, London, for over 25 years; after her death, a section of the school library was renamed in her memory.

In &quot;63&quot;, after much of the earlier footage, particularly from &quot;56&quot;, Russ and her daughters recall her death and discuss its effect on them.

===Sue===
Susan (Sue) Davis attended the same primary school as Jackie and Lynn and following that attended a comprehensive school. Sue married at 24 and had two children before getting divorced. She has been engaged to her current boyfriend, Glenn, for 21 years as of &quot;63&quot;. She works as a university administrator for Queen Mary, University of London, despite not having gone to university herself, and is fond of amateur dramatics. By &quot;63&quot;, she is looking forward to retiring in the near future.

===Tony===
Tony Walker was chosen from a primary school in the East End of London and was introduced along with his classmate Michelle, who Douglas Keay, the narrator, stated was Tony&#x27;s &quot;girlfriend&quot;. At age 7, Michelle described Tony as a &quot;monkey&quot;. He wanted to be a jockey at 7 and was at a stable training as one by 14. By 21, his chance had come and gone after riding in three races before giving it up. He was proud to have competed against Lester Piggott. He then gained &quot;the Knowledge&quot; and made a comfortable life for himself and his family as a London taxi driver. His later dream of becoming an actor has met with modest success; he has had small parts as an extra (almost always playing a cabbie) in several TV programmes since 1986, including &quot;The Bill&quot; and twice in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, most recently in 2003. His wife, Debbie, was carrying their third child in &quot;28&quot;, and she reveals in &quot;35&quot; that she lost that baby but has since had another; she admits that losing their third child placed a tremendous stress on their relationship. Tony admitted in &quot;35&quot; that being in a monogamous relationship was becoming a strain, and by &quot;42&quot;, he had actually committed adultery, though he and his wife have got past it and are still together. By &quot;42&quot;, he had moved to Essex, and by &quot;49&quot;, owned two homes, including a holiday home in Spain. In &quot;63&quot;, he and his wife had settled in the English countryside.

===Paul===
Paul Kligerman was at an orphanage (called Children&#x27;s Home) in the East End of London at 7, his parents having divorced and he having been left with his father. Soon after &quot;Seven Up!&quot;, his father and stepmother moved the family to Australia, where he has remained in the Melbourne area ever since. By 21, he had long hair and a girlfriend whom he is still married to. After leaving school he was employed as a bricklayer and later set up his own business. In &quot;49&quot;, he is working for a sign-making company. In &quot;21&quot;, &quot;49&quot; and &quot;63&quot;, Paul was reunited with Symon, who had attended the same boarding school; portions of their time together are included in all three films. By &quot;56&quot;, Paul had started work at a local retirement village with his wife Susan. He does odd jobs and maintenance of the small units and gardens.

===Symon===
Symon Basterfield, given name also spelt Simon in previous films, chosen from the same orphanage (called Children&#x27;s Home) in the East End of London as Paul, is the only mixed-race participant. He never got to know his black father, and had left the orphanage in the East End of London to live with his white mother by the time of the &quot;7 Plus Seven&quot; filming; her depression is alluded to as the cause for his being in the home. As filming for &quot;35&quot; took place, he was going through a divorce from his first wife and mother of his five children, and he elected not to participate. Symon returned for &quot;42&quot; and &quot;49&quot;, remarried with one son and one stepdaughter. In &quot;49&quot;, he and his wife had become foster parents. By &quot;56&quot;, he regretted his lack of formal education, which he felt limited his income over the years. He remains happily married and looks forward to the next chapters of his life. In &quot;63&quot;, his relationship with his children from his first marriage is mending and he has 10 grandchildren.

===Nick===
William Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Hitchon was born on 22 October 1957 and raised on a small farm in Arncliffe, a tiny village in the Yorkshire Dales. (He was only 6 when &quot;Seven Up!&quot; was first broadcast, and therefore always remained a year younger than the episodes&#x27; nominal age.) He was educated in a one-room school four miles&#x27; walk from his home, and later at a boarding school. He went to Oxford University (where, he mentions in &quot;63 Up&quot;, Theresa May was a contemporary) and then moved to the United States to work as a nuclear physicist. He married Jackie, another British immigrant, who participated in &quot;28&quot; but was displeased with how her comments were received by viewers, many of whom apparently concluded that the marriage was doomed. She declined to appear in &quot;35&quot; and &quot;42&quot;. By &quot;49&quot;, the couple had divorced and Nick had remarried, this time to Cryss Brunner, ten years his senior, and at that time taught in Minneapolis. Nick was a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department from 1982 to 2022, serving as department chair from 1999 to 2002. He appeared as a guest on NPR&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; aired 21 June 2014, and spoke briefly about his participation in the &quot;Up&quot; series. By &quot;63&quot;, he had developed a cancerous mass in his throat and had recently lost his father, leading him to contemplate mortality and the future of his family after his death (he says at one point that if there is a &quot;70&quot; edition of the series, he will not be alive to participate in it). Nick retired from the university in spring 2022 and died on 23 July 2023 at the age of 65.

===Peter===
Peter Davies went to the same middle-class Liverpool suburban school as Neil, who, like Peter, wanted to be an astronaut. Peter drifted through university, and by age 28, he was an underpaid and seemingly uninspired school teacher. Peter dropped out of the series after &quot;28&quot;, following a tabloid press campaign against him after he criticised the government of Margaret Thatcher in his interview. The director&#x27;s commentary for &quot;42&quot; revealed that he later divorced, took up study of the law, became a lawyer, remarried, had children and moved back to Liverpool. He returned in &quot;56&quot; to promote his band, the Liverpool-based country-influenced The Good Intentions; the group was still together, although one member had died, in &quot;63&quot;.

===Neil===
Neil Hughes, from a Liverpool suburb, turned out to be perhaps the most unpredictable of the group. At seven he was a happy child, funny and full of life and hope, but by &quot;7 Plus Seven&quot;, he was nervous and stressed. By &quot;21&quot;, he was living in a squat in London, having dropped out of Aberdeen University after one term, and was finding work as he could on building sites. During the interview, he was in an agitated state. At 28, he was still homeless, although now in Scotland; by 35, he was living in a council house in the Shetland Islands off the north coast of Scotland, writing and appearing in the local pantomime. By &quot;42&quot;, he was living in Bruce&#x27;s apartment in London and Bruce had become a source of emotional support. He was involved in local council politics, as a Liberal Democrat in the London Borough of Hackney, and had completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Open University. He was first elected to Wick ward on Hackney London Borough Council in 1996, and resigned his seat in 2000.

By &quot;49&quot;, he was a district councillor in the Eden district of Cumbria, in North West England. He was first elected for Shap on Eden District in 2003. He was a candidate for Eden Lakes on Cumbria County Council in 2005 and 2009, coming second to the Conservative candidate on both occasions. In 2013, following new division boundaries, Neil was elected to Eden Lakes, and did not stand again for Shap. He was re-elected to Eden Lakes in 2017.

He stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Stockton North in the 2005 general election and for Carlisle in the 2010 general election, finishing third on both occasions. Neil stood for Penrith and the Border—which covers the same area he represents as a councillor—at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. In 2015, he came fourth, whilst in 2017, he came third. At the 2019 general election, Hughes contested the Labour–Conservative marginal seat of Workington in Cumbria. Finishing fourth, he increased the party&#x27;s vote share, but lost his deposit.

By &quot;63&quot;, Neil has married; however, he and his wife have separated due to unspecified difficulties. He is a lay Baptist preacher, district councillor and also has a home in France.

===Bruce===
Bruce Balden, as a child, was concerned with poverty and racial discrimination and wanted to become a missionary. He was attending a private boarding school. At the age of seven, he said that his greatest desire was to see his father, a soldier in Southern Rhodesia, and he seemed brave though a little abandoned. In &quot;21&quot;, Bruce was studying mathematics at Oxford University. After graduation, he worked in an insurance company for a short term. He then began to teach maths at a school in the East End of London. He said that he enjoyed being a part of people&#x27;s advancement. In &quot;35&quot;, he was taking a sabbatical leave and teaching maths and English in Sylhet, Bangladesh, as well as helping teachers design courses. He subsequently returned to London and continued teaching in the East End. Just before &quot;42&quot;, he married a fellow teacher: Apted broke the seven-year structure to film the wedding, which was also attended by Neil. Eventually becoming worn down by teaching in the East End, Bruce got a teaching position at St Albans School, Hertfordshire, a prestigious public school. Between &quot;42&quot; and &quot;49&quot;, he had two sons. In &quot;56&quot;, he admitted he still had a hard time expressing his innermost feelings, in particular to his wife, but was a happily devoted father and husband. Still teaching at St Albans School with his wife, he had no regrets about the development of his career.

==Participation record==

==Motifs==
A number of themes have appeared repeatedly over the course of the series. Questions about religion, family, class, happiness and psychological state dominate many of the interviews, as well as inquiries about the worries and concerns subjects have for their future. In addition, questions often take a personal tone, with Apted noting that viewers often respond to his questioning of Neil&#x27;s sanity or his perception of Tony&#x27;s success in life as being too personal, but that he has been able to do this because of the friendship he has developed with the subjects over the course of their lives.

==Critical responses, including awards==

The series has received high praise over the years. Roger Ebert said that it is &quot;an inspired, even noble, use of the film medium&quot;, that the films &quot;penetrate to the central mystery of life&quot;, and that the series is among his top ten films of all time. Michael Apted won an Institutional Peabody Award in 2012 for his work on the &quot;Up&quot; series. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;28 Up&quot; placed 26th.

The &quot;Up&quot; series has been criticised by both ethnographers and the subjects themselves for its editing style. Mitchell Duneier has pointed out that Apted has the ability to assert causal relationships between a character&#x27;s past and present that might not actually exist. Apted has acknowledged this fact, pointing out that in &quot;21 Up&quot; he believed Tony would soon be in prison, so he filmed him around dangerous areas for use in later films. Apted also portrayed the troubled marriage of Nick earlier in the film, although his time frame for anticipating their divorce was premature. Apted has stated in interviews that his &quot;tendency to play God&quot; with the interviews was &quot;foolishness and wrong.&quot; In &quot;21 Up&quot;, the women participants were offended that all the questions concerned domestic affairs, marriage and children, rather than politics. A &quot;New Yorker&quot; article by Rebecca Mead noted &quot;[Apted] can be unbearably patronizing toward his subjects, particularly the working-class women, while he sets his more affluent participants up to look ludicrous.&quot; However, she did note that &quot;To his credit, Apted has shown participants arguing back against the show&#x27;s premise and against his own prejudices. One of the most exhilarating moments in the series occurs in &#x27;49 Up&#x27;, when Jackie [...] rounds on Apted, castigating him for his decades of underestimating her. Apted&#x27;s implied humility is ultimately, if belatedly, Jackie&#x27;s vindication.&quot;

==Influence on participants==

Over the course of the project the programme has in varying degrees had a direct effect on the lives of its participants. The series participants often speak of the series having become popular enough that they were recognised in public. For instance, in &quot;56 Up&quot;, Tony related an anecdote about giving a ride to Buzz Aldrin, and being surprised when a passerby asks him, not Aldrin, for an autograph.

The participants&#x27; opinions regarding being involved in the series are often mentioned, and varied greatly among the participants. John refers to the programme as a poison pill that he is subjected to every seven years, while Paul&#x27;s wife credits the series for keeping their marriage together. Michael Apted has commented that one of the big surprises between filming &quot;42 Up&quot; and &quot;49 Up&quot; was the impact of reality television—i.e., that the subjects wanted to talk about their contribution to the series in the light of this genre.

In addition, there have been instances of the interactions of participants being engineered by the programme&#x27;s producers. For instance, Paul and Nick were flown back to England at Granada&#x27;s expense for the filming of &quot;35 Up&quot; and &quot;42 Up&quot; respectively. In addition, Paul was flown back again for &quot;49 Up&quot; and visited Symon; Symon and his wife were in turn flown to Australia to visit Paul in &quot;63 Up&quot;. As well, Bruce was affected by Neil&#x27;s plight and offered him temporary shelter in his home shortly before &quot;42 Up&quot;, allowing Neil time to get settled in London; despite Neil&#x27;s eccentricities during his two-month stay, they clearly remained friends, with Neil later giving a reading at Bruce&#x27;s wedding. In &quot;56 Up&quot;, Suzy and Nick are interviewed together, having become friends due to their shared rural upbringing.

==Cultural and broader influences==

The original hypothesis of &quot;Seven Up!&quot; was that class structure is so strong in the UK that a person&#x27;s life path would be set at birth. The producer of the original programme had at one point thought to line the children up on the street, have three of them step forward and narrate &quot;of these twenty children, only three will be successful&quot; (an idea which was not used). The idea of class immobility held up in most, but not all, cases as the series has progressed. The children from the working classes have by and large remained in those circles, though Tony seems to have become more middle class. Apted has said that one of his regrets is that they did not take feminism into account, and consequently had fewer girls in their study and did not select them on the basis of any possible careers they might choose.

Although it began as a political documentary, the series has become a film of human nature and existentialism. In the director&#x27;s commentary for &quot;42 Up&quot;, Apted comments that he did not realise the series had changed tone from political to personal until &quot;21 Up&quot;, when he showed the film to American friends who encouraged him to submit it (successfully) to American film festivals. Apted also comments that this realisation was a relief to him and allowed the films to breathe a little more.

The series has also been satirised. &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; 2007 episode &quot;Springfield Up&quot; is narrated by an Apted-like filmmaker who depicts the past and current lives of a group of Springfield residents he has revisited every eight years. The &quot;37 Up&quot; segment of &quot;Tracey Ullman: A Class Act&quot;, first aired in 1992, parodies the series. Harry Enfield parodied the series in a spoof titled &quot;2 Up&quot; with his characters Tim Nice-but-Dim and Wayne Slob. The Australian comedy TV series &quot;The Late Show&quot; satirised the series with a version in which participants were interviewed every seven minutes.

<doc id="434214" wikidata="Q5205292" url="?curid=434214" title="DJ Dextrous">
<text>Errol Francis, better known as DJ Dextrous, is a British DJ, producer and composer.

==Personal life==
Dextrous was born and raised in Stoke Newington, London Borough of Hackney, London, England. He was classmates with DJ Hype and Smiley and PJ from the group Shut Up and Dance, and DJed at Brooke House Secondary School, where he played trumpet in the brass band, and sang in the school choir. Rude Boy Keith, his partner from their King of the Jungle record label also attended the boys school at the same time, as well as Daddy Earl (twin brother of Smiley and DJ Hype&#x27;s MC).

==Career==
Dextrous took his DJing up a gear when he started to play at parties and small clubs in 1987. At around the same time, he began putting his studio together, based around an Atari 520STFM, Casio HT3000 keyboard, Casio CZ-101 Synth and Yamaha &quot;TX7&quot; Sound Module. He released his first record in 1992, on Ruff Quality Recordings (the sister label of Shut Up and Dance Records) entitled &quot;Ruffneck Biznizz&quot; which topped the Kiss FM House charts. This track was one of the precursors to the jungle scene, with its sped up breakbeats and reggae/dub basslines.
In 1993, Dextrous met Teebone and they started producing together under a number of aliases including Fusion Forum, producing tracks like &quot;Vintage Keys&quot; and &quot;Summer Mist&quot;, on Reinforced Records.

===Music labels===
Dextrous decided to start his own label, King of the Jungle Records, with Rude Boy Keith (real name Keith Lawrence), who was working for Shut Up and Dance at the time, and who also attended Brooke House School during the time Dextrous, DJ Hype, Smiley and PJ were there. Dextrous and Rude Boy Keith also became a DJ and MC double act that travelled far and wide, spreading their sound through dubplate specials and PA-ing their latest recordings. During that time, the pair signed to Suburban Base to release &quot;Da Kings of the Jungle&quot; trilogy. Dextrous was one of the leading lights within the ever-growing jungle scene, and could also be heard on Sunday mornings playing on Kool FM, one of the main pirate radio stations in London. 

Never one to keep still, Dextrous parted company with the radio station and then subsequently King of the Jungle Records in 1995. By then, he had already launched two further record labels, State of the Art Recordings alongside partners Paul Brown and Jon Stewart, and Subversive Recordings (formerly Subliminal Recordings) which featured a number of collaborations with longtime production partner Teebone including &quot;Selectors Roll&quot; which featured on the Suburban Base compilation album, &quot;Drum &amp; Bass Selection 3 (The Dub Plate Selection)&quot; and &quot;Top Gun&quot;. These labels allowed Dextrous further creative freedom, the former being his platform to express his jazz roots. As a trio, Paul, Jon and Dex recorded under the moniker Solid State. Collectively, they have been credited as one of the pioneers of the liquid funk scene. Together they created the sound they branded &quot;urban fusion&quot; to cover all of the creative influences evident in their music, including jazz, dub, Detroit techno, garage, funk and reggae. During this time, Solid State recorded for Fabio&#x27;s Creative Source label as well as Renegade Recordings and Alan McGee&#x27;s Eruption Records (Creation Records&#x27; sister label).

===Aliases===
Dextrous has recorded drum and bass/jungle and several other genres including broken beats, UK garage, nu jazz, R&amp;B, dub and jazz fusion under many aliases:

* Transcendent Minds
* Solid State
* DJ Rus De Tox
* Forbidden Zone
* Fusion Forum
* Retro-Spec
* Da Kings of the Jungle
* Back2Back
* The Regulators
* Tit 4 Tat
* E.F.Jay

He also regularly composes the library/production music for radio and TV.

==Awards==
He provided the music for the documentary &quot;Feltham Sings&quot;, which won the BAFTA Award and an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Original Music for TV&quot; in 2003. He was also nominated for a Royal Television Society award for &quot;Best Original Music for TV&quot; in the same year. 

== Discography ==

<text>The Workers Internationalist League was a Trotskyist group in Britain founded in the summer of 1983 by the Internationalist Faction of the Workers Socialist League. It was the British affiliate of the Trotskyist International Liaison Committee until that body was renamed the International Trotskyist Committee.

Although a small group, it immediately moved to producing a paper which was called &quot;Workers&#x27; International News&quot; in mimicry of the magazine of the war-time Workers International League. For a small group of no more than 35 members this was a major undertaking.

The main concern of the new group was to clarify its ideas and where to concentrate their work. Therefore, the question of how to orient to the Labour Party was a major area of debate. On the one hand, comrades around Mike Jones, close to the views of the Workers&#x27; Party (Argentina) (PO), were for working in the Labour Party Young Socialists and were hostile to the United Secretariat of the Fourth International forces then in the Labour Party. This was an important question for the group as the Italian section of the TILC moved to join the USFI group in that country. On the other extreme of the group, Chris Erswell was supportive of the Italian TILC group&#x27;s orientation.

Meanwhile, the senior leader of the WIL, Pete Flack, found himself isolated when the rest of the National Committee opposed the Italian tactic of fusion with the USFI. The WIL was being pulled in different directions by other Trotskyist tendencies, with the TILC, PO and the Workers Power group all representing different poles of attraction. This became obvious at the first national conference of the group, held in December 1983.

The conference solved none of the problems of the group and in January 1984 eleven supporters of the TILC left the WIL to establish the Workers International Review Group. The TILC refused to make them their official British section, instead choosing TILC sympathisers still in the WIL. They formed a Tendency for Political Clarification which was itself clarified when 3 of its 5 members left to join Workers Power. The remaining two members of the tendency then formed a Liaison Committee with the Workers International Review Group which led to the formation of the Revolutionary Internationalist League in November 1984, which was the British section of the International Trotskyist Committee (formed that summer from the TILC) until its split in 1991. The rump WIL would seem to have expired in the meantime.

<doc id="434220" wikidata="Q850118" url="?curid=434220" title="Claves">
<text>Claves (; ) are a percussion instrument consisting of a pair of short, wooden sticks about 20–25 centimeters (8–10 inches) long and about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter. Although traditionally made of wood (typically rosewood, ebony or grenadilla) many modern manufacturers offer claves made of fiberglass or plastic.

When struck, claves produce a bright, penetrating clicking noise. This makes them useful when playing in large dance bands. Claves are sometimes hollow and carved in the middle to amplify the sound.

== History ==

Claves have been very important in the development of Afro-Cuban music, such as the son and guaguancó.They are also often used in Samba music. They are often used to play an ostinato, or repeating rhythmic figure, throughout a piece known as the clave.

Many examples of clave-like instruments can be found around the world.

== Technique ==

The basic principle when playing claves is to allow at least one of them to resonate. The usual technique is to hold one lightly with the thumb and fingertips of the non-dominant hand, with the palm up. This forms the hand into a resonating chamber for the clave. Holding the clave on top of fingernails makes the sound clearer. The other is held by the dominant hand at one end with a firmer grip, much like how one normally holds a drumstick. With the end of this clave, the player strikes the resting clave in the center.

Traditionally, the striking clave is called &quot;el macho&quot; (&quot;the male&quot;) and the resting clave is called &quot;la hembra&quot; (&quot;the female&quot;). This terminology is used even when the claves are identical.

A roll can be achieved on the claves by holding one clave between the thumb and first two fingers, and then alternating pressure between the two fingers to move the clave back and forth. This clave is placed against the resonating clave to produce a roll.

== Use in popular music ==
Some salsa singers play this percussion while singing. 

Among the bands to have used claves are the Beatles in their recordings &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and The Who in their song &quot;Magic Bus&quot;.

Claves are also utilized in the interstitial spaces of the &quot;Night Court&quot; theme.

== Use in classical music ==
Many composers looking to emulate Afro-Cuban music will often use claves such as Arturo Márquez with &quot;Danzón No. 2&quot; or George Gershwin with his &quot;Cuban Overture&quot;.

Steve Reich&#x27;s &quot;Music for Pieces of Wood&quot; is written for five pairs of claves.

<doc id="434221" wikidata="Q186447" url="?curid=434221" title="James Webb Space Telescope">
<text>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.

Although the Webb&#x27;s mirror diameter is 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it produces images of comparable resolution because it observes in the longer-wavelength infrared spectrum. The longer the wavelength of the spectrum, the larger the information-gathering surface required (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) for an image comparable in clarity to the visible spectrum of the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. In January 2022 it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point, about from Earth. The telescope&#x27;s first image was released to the public on 11 July 2022.

The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led Webb&#x27;s design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University operates Webb. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman.

The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.

Webb&#x27;s primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which together create a mirror, compared with Hubble&#x27;s . This gives Webb a light-collecting area of about , about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 μm), and near infrared (0.8–2.5 μm) spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.5 μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below , so that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. Its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

Initial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays. A major redesign was accomplished in 2005, with construction completed in 2016, followed by years of exhaustive testing, at a total cost of US$10 billion.

== Features ==
The mass of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is about half that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Webb has a gold-coated beryllium primary mirror made up of 18 separate hexagonal mirrors. The mirror has a polished area of , of which is obscured by the secondary support struts, giving a total collecting area of . This is over six times larger than the collecting area of Hubble&#x27;s diameter mirror, which has a collecting area of . The mirror has a gold coating to provide infrared reflectivity and this is covered by a thin layer of glass for durability.

Webb is designed primarily for near-infrared astronomy, but can also see orange and red visible light, as well as the mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument being used. It can detect objects up to 100 times fainter than Hubble can, and objects much earlier in the history of the universe, back to redshift z≈20 (about 180 million years cosmic time after the Big Bang). For comparison, the earliest stars are thought to have formed between z≈30 and z≈20 (100–180 million years cosmic time), and the first galaxies may have formed around redshift z≈15 (about 270 million years cosmic time). Hubble is unable to see further back than very early reionization at about z≈11.1 (galaxy GN-z11, 400 million years cosmic time).

The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for several reasons:
* high-redshift (very early and distant) objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, and therefore their light can be observed only via infrared astronomy;
* infrared light passes more easily through dust clouds than visible light;
* colder objects such as debris disks and planets emit most strongly in the infrared;
* these infrared bands are difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.
Ground-based telescopes must look through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure at right). Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane, also exist in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, vastly complicating analysis. Existing space telescopes such as Hubble cannot study these bands since their mirrors are insufficiently cool (the Hubble mirror is maintained at about ) which means that the telescope itself radiates strongly in the relevant infrared bands.

Webb can also observe objects in the Solar System at an angle of more than 85° from the Sun and having an apparent angular rate of motion less than 0.03 arc seconds per second. This includes Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, their satellites, and comets, asteroids and minor planets at or beyond the orbit of Mars. Webb has the near-IR and mid-IR sensitivity to be able to observe virtually all known Kuiper Belt Objects. In addition, it can observe opportunistic and unplanned targets within 48 hours of a decision to do so, such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

=== Location and orbit ===
Webb operates in a halo orbit, circling around a point in space known as the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point, approximately beyond Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. Its actual position varies between about from L2 as it orbits, keeping it out of both Earth and Moon&#x27;s shadow. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits above Earth&#x27;s surface, and the Moon is roughly from Earth. Objects near this Sun–Earth point can orbit the Sun in synchrony with the Earth, allowing the telescope to remain at a roughly constant distance with continuous orientation of its sunshield and equipment bus toward the Sun, Earth and Moon. Combined with its wide shadow-avoiding orbit, the telescope can simultaneously block incoming heat and light from all three of these bodies and avoid even the smallest changes of temperature from Earth and Moon shadows that would affect the structure, yet still maintain uninterrupted solar power and Earth communications on its sun-facing side. This arrangement keeps the temperature of the spacecraft constant and below the necessary for faint infrared observations.

=== Sunshield protection ===

To make observations in the infrared spectrum, Webb must be kept under ; otherwise, infrared radiation from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments. Its large sunshield blocks light and heat from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and its position near the Sun–Earth keeps all three bodies on the same side of the spacecraft at all times. Its halo orbit around the L2 point avoids the shadow of the Earth and Moon, maintaining a constant environment for the sunshield and solar arrays. The resulting stable temperature for the structures on the dark side is critical to maintaining precise alignment of the primary mirror segments.

The sunshield consists of five layers, each approximately as thin as a human hair. Each layer is made of Kapton E film, coated with aluminum on both sides. The two outermost layers have an additional coating of doped silicon on the Sun-facing sides, to better reflect the Sun&#x27;s heat back into space. Accidental tears of the delicate film structure during deployment testing in 2018 led to further delays to the telescope deployment.

The sunshield was designed to be folded twelve times so that it would fit within the Ariane 5 rocket&#x27;s payload fairing, which is in diameter, and long. The shield&#x27;s fully deployed dimensions were planned as .

Keeping within the shadow of the sunshield limits the field of regard of Webb at any given time. The telescope can see 40 percent of the sky from any one position, but can see all of the sky over a period of six months.

=== Optics ===

Webb&#x27;s primary mirror is a -diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector with a collecting area of . If it had been designed as a single, large mirror, it would have been too large for existing launch vehicles. The mirror is therefore composed of 18 hexagonal segments (a technique pioneered by Guido Horn d&#x27;Arturo), which unfolded after the telescope was launched. Image plane wavefront sensing through phase retrieval is used to position the mirror segments in the correct location using precise actuators. Subsequent to this initial configuration, they only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus. This is unlike terrestrial telescopes, for example the Keck telescopes, which continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading. The Webb telescope uses 132 small actuation motors to position and adjust the optics. The actuators can position the mirror with 10 nanometer accuracy.

Webb&#x27;s optical design is a three-mirror anastigmat, which makes use of curved secondary and tertiary mirrors to deliver images that are free from optical aberrations over a wide field. The secondary mirror is in diameter. In addition, there is a fine steering mirror which can adjust its position many times per second to provide image stabilization. Point light sources in images taken by Webb have six diffraction spikes plus two fainter ones, due to the hexagonal shape of the primary mirror segments.

=== Scientific instruments ===


The Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is a framework that provides electrical power, computing resources, cooling capability as well as structural stability to the Webb telescope. It is made with bonded graphite-epoxy composite attached to the underside of Webb&#x27;s telescope structure. The ISIM holds the four science instruments and a guide camera.
* NIRCam (Near Infrared Camera) is an infrared imager which has spectral coverage ranging from the edge of the visible (0.6 μm) through to the near infrared (5 μm). There are 10 sensors each of 4 megapixels. NIRCam serves as the observatory&#x27;s wavefront sensor, which is required for wavefront sensing and control activities, used to align and focus the main mirror segments. NIRCam was built by a team led by the University of Arizona, with principal investigator Marcia J. Rieke.
* NIRSpec (Near Infrared Spectrograph) performs spectroscopy over the same wavelength range. It was built by the European Space Agency (ESA) at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands. The leading development team includes members from Airbus Defence and Space, Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, and the Goddard Space Flight Center; with Pierre Ferruit (École normale supérieure de Lyon) as NIRSpec project scientist. The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution mode using a prism, an R~1000 multi-object mode, and an R~2700 integral field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Switching of the modes is done by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism called the Filter Wheel Assembly, and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating Wheel Assembly mechanism. Both mechanisms are based on the successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the Infrared Space Observatory. The multi-object mode relies on a complex micro-shutter mechanism to allow for simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects anywhere in NIRSpec&#x27;s field of view. There are two sensors, each of 4 megapixels.
* MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) measures the mid-to-long-infrared wavelength range from 5 to 27 μm. It contains both a mid-infrared camera and an imaging spectrometer. MIRI was developed as a collaboration between NASA and a consortium of European countries, and is led by George Rieke (University of Arizona) and Gillian Wright (UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Edinburgh, Scotland). The temperature of the MIRI must not exceed : a helium gas mechanical cooler sited on the warm side of the environmental shield provides this cooling.
* FGS/NIRISS (Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph), led by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) under project scientist John Hutchings (Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre), is used to stabilize the line-of-sight of the observatory during science observations. Measurements by the FGS are used both to control the overall orientation of the spacecraft and to drive the fine steering mirror for image stabilization. The CSA also provided a Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) module for astronomical imaging and spectroscopy in the 0.8 to 5 μm wavelength range, led by principal investigator René Doyon at the Université de Montréal. Although they are often referred together as a unit, the NIRISS and FGS serve entirely different purposes, with one being a scientific instrument and the other being a part of the observatory&#x27;s support infrastructure.

NIRCam and MIRI feature starlight-blocking coronagraphs for observation of faint targets such as extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks very close to bright stars.

=== Spacecraft bus ===

The spacecraft bus is the primary support component of the JWST, hosting a multitude of computing, communication, electric power, propulsion, and structural parts. Along with the sunshield, it forms the spacecraft element of the space telescope. The spacecraft bus is on the Sun-facing &quot;warm&quot; side of the sunshield and operates at a temperature of about .

The structure of the spacecraft bus has a mass of , and must support the space telescope. It is made primarily of graphite composite material. The assembly was completed in California in 2015. It was integrated with the rest of the space telescope leading to its 2021 launch. The spacecraft bus can rotate the telescope with a pointing precision of one arcsecond, and isolates vibration to two milliarcseconds.

Webb has two pairs of rocket engines (one pair for redundancy) to make course corrections on the way to L2 and for station keepingmaintaining the correct position in the halo orbit. Eight smaller thrusters are used for attitude controlthe correct pointing of the spacecraft. The engines use hydrazine fuel ( at launch) and dinitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer ( at launch).

=== Servicing ===
Webb is not intended to be serviced in space. A crewed mission to repair or upgrade the observatory, as was done for Hubble, would not be possible, and according to NASA Associate Administrator Thomas Zurbuchen, despite best efforts, an uncrewed remote mission was found to be beyond available technology at the time Webb was designed. During the long Webb testing period, NASA officials referred to the idea of a servicing mission, but no plans were announced. Since the successful launch, NASA has stated that nevertheless limited accommodation was made to facilitate future servicing missions. These accommodations included precise guidance markers in the form of crosses on the surface of Webb, for use by remote servicing missions, as well as refillable fuel tanks, removable heat protectors, and accessible attachment points.

=== Software ===
Ilana Dashevsky and Vicki Balzano write that Webb uses a modified version of JavaScript, called Nombas ScriptEase 5.00e, for its operations; it follows the ECMAScript standard and &quot;allows for a modular design flow, where on-board scripts call lower-level scripts that are defined as functions&quot;. &quot;The JWST science operations will be driven by ASCII (instead of binary command blocks) on-board scripts, written in a customized version of JavaScript. The script interpreter is run by the flight software, which is written in the programming language C++. The flight software operates the spacecraft and the science instruments.&quot;

== Comparison with other telescopes ==

The desire for a large infrared space telescope traces back decades. In the United States, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (later called the Spitzer Space Telescope) was planned while the Space Shuttle was in development, and the potential for infrared astronomy was acknowledged at that time. Unlike ground telescopes, space observatories are free from atmospheric absorption of infrared light. Space observatories opened a &quot;new sky&quot; for astronomers.

However, there is a challenge involved in the design of infrared telescopes: they need to stay extremely cold, and the longer the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful design. One method is to put the key instruments in a dewar with an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium. The coolant will slowly vaporize, limiting the lifetime of the instrument from as short as a few months to a few years at most.

It is also possible to maintain a low temperature by designing the spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, as with the extended missions of the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, which operated at reduced capacity after coolant depletion. Another example is Hubble&#x27;s Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple of years, but was then replaced during the STS-109 servicing mission with a cryocooler that worked continuously. The Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sunshields and radiators, with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler.

Webb&#x27;s delays and cost increases have been compared to those of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. When Hubble formally started in 1972, it had an estimated development cost of US$300 million (), but by the time it was sent into orbit in 1990, the cost was about four times that. In addition, new instruments and servicing missions increased the cost to at least US$9 billion by 2006 ().

== Development history ==
=== Background (development to 2003) ===
Discussions of a Hubble follow-on started in the 1980s, but serious planning began in the early 1990s. The &quot;Hi-Z&quot; telescope concept was developed between 1989 and 1994: a fully baffled aperture infrared telescope that would recede to an orbit at 3 Astronomical unit (AU). This distant orbit would have benefited from reduced light noise from zodiacal dust. Other early plans called for a NEXUS precursor telescope mission.

Correcting the flawed optics of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its first years played a significant role in the birth of Webb. In 1993, NASA conducted STS-61, the Space Shuttle mission that replaced HST&#x27;s camera and installed a retrofit for its imaging spectrograph to compensate for the spherical aberration in its primary mirror.

The HST &amp; Beyond Committee was formed in 1994 &quot;to study possible missions and programs for optical-ultraviolet astronomy in space for the first decades of the 21st century.&quot; Emboldened by HST&#x27;s success, its 1996 report explored the concept of a larger and much colder, infrared-sensitive telescope that could reach back in cosmic time to the birth of the first galaxies. This high-priority science goal was beyond the HST&#x27;s capability because, as a warm telescope, it is blinded by infrared emission from its own optical system. In addition to recommendations to extend the HST mission to 2005 and to develop technologies for finding planets around other stars, NASA embraced the chief recommendation of HST &amp; Beyond for a large, cold space telescope (radiatively cooled far below 0 °C), and began the planning process for the future Webb telescope.

Preparation for the 2000 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey (a literature review produced by the United States National Research Council that includes identifying research priorities and making recommendations for the upcoming decade) included further development of the scientific program for what became known as the Next Generation Space Telescope, and advancements in relevant technologies by NASA. As it matured, studying the birth of galaxies in the young universe, and searching for planets around other starsthe prime goals coalesced as &quot;Origins&quot; by HST &amp; Beyond became prominent.

As hoped, the NGST received the highest ranking in the 2000 Decadal Survey.

An administrator of NASA, Dan Goldin, coined the phrase &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot;, and opted for the next big paradigm shift for astronomy, namely, breaking the barrier of a single mirror. That meant going from &quot;eliminate moving parts&quot; to &quot;learn to live with moving parts&quot; (i.e. segmented optics). With the goal to reduce mass density tenfold, silicon carbide with a very thin layer of glass on top was first looked at, but beryllium was selected at the end.

The mid-1990s era of &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; produced the NGST concept, with an aperture to be flown to , roughly estimated to cost US$500 million. In 1997, NASA worked with the Goddard Space Flight Center, Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies, and TRW to conduct technical requirement and cost studies of the three different concepts, and in 1999 selected Lockheed Martin and TRW for preliminary concept studies. Launch was at that time planned for 2007, but the launch date was pushed back many times (see table further down).

In 2002, the project was renamed after NASA&#x27;s second administrator (1961–1968), James E. Webb (1906–1992). Webb led the agency during the Apollo program and established scientific research as a core NASA activity.

In 2003, NASA awarded TRW the US$824.8 million prime contract for Webb. The design called for a de-scoped primary mirror and a launch date of 2010. Later that year, TRW was acquired by Northrop Grumman in a hostile bid and became Northrop Grumman Space Technology.

=== Early development and replanning (2003–2007) ===
Development was managed by NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, with John C. Mather as its project scientist. The primary contractor was Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, responsible for developing and building the spacecraft element, which included the satellite bus, sunshield, Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) which connects the Optical Telescope Element to the spacecraft bus, and the Mid Boom Assembly (MBA) which helps to deploy the large sunshields on orbit, while Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies was subcontracted to develop and build the OTE itself, and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM).

Cost growth revealed in spring 2005 led to an August 2005 re-planning. The primary technical outcomes of the re-planning were significant changes in the integration and test plans, a 22-month launch delay (from 2011 to 2013), and elimination of system-level testing for observatory modes at wavelengths shorter than 1.7 μm. Other major features of the observatory were unchanged. Following the re-planning, the project was independently reviewed in April 2006.

In the 2005 re-plan, the life-cycle cost of the project was estimated at US$4.5 billion. This comprised approximately US$3.5 billion for design, development, launch and commissioning, and approximately US$1.0 billion for ten years of operations. The ESA agreed in 2004 to contributing about €300 million, including the launch. The CSA pledged CA$39 million in 2007 and in 2012 delivered its contributions in equipment to point the telescope and detect atmospheric conditions on distant planets.

=== Detailed design and construction (2007–2021) ===
In January 2007, nine of the ten technology development items in the project successfully passed a Non-Advocate Review. These technologies were deemed sufficiently mature to retire significant risks in the project. The remaining technology development item (the MIRI cryocooler) completed its technology maturation milestone in April 2007. This technology review represented the beginning step in the process that ultimately moved the project into its detailed design phase (Phase C). By May 2007, costs were still on target. In March 2008, the project successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). In April 2008, the project passed the Non-Advocate Review. Other passed reviews include the Integrated Science Instrument Module review in March 2009, the Optical Telescope Element review completed in October 2009, and the Sunshield review completed in January 2010.

In April 2010, the telescope passed the technical portion of its Mission Critical Design Review (MCDR). Passing the MCDR signified the integrated observatory can meet all science and engineering requirements for its mission. The MCDR encompassed all previous design reviews. The project schedule underwent review during the months following the MCDR, in a process called the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which led to a re-plan of the mission aiming for a 2015 launch, but as late as 2018. By 2010, cost over-runs were impacting other projects, though Webb itself remained on schedule.

By 2011, the Webb project was in the final design and fabrication phase (Phase C).

Assembly of the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, which was done via robotic arm, began in November 2015 and was completed on 3 February 2016. The secondary mirror was installed on 3 March 2016. Final construction of the Webb telescope was completed in November 2016, after which extensive testing procedures began.

In March 2018, NASA delayed Webb&#x27;s launch an additional two years to May 2020 after the telescope&#x27;s sunshield ripped during a practice deployment and the sunshield&#x27;s cables did not sufficiently tighten. In June 2018, NASA delayed the launch by an additional 10 months to March 2021, based on the assessment of the independent review board convened after the failed March 2018 test deployment. The review identified that Webb launch and deployment had 344 potential single-point failures – tasks that had no alternative or means of recovery if unsuccessful, and therefore had to succeed for the telescope to work. In August 2019, the mechanical integration of the telescope was completed, something that was scheduled to be done 12 years before in 2007.

After construction was completed, Webb underwent final tests at Northrop Grumman&#x27;s historic Space Park in Redondo Beach, California. A ship carrying the telescope left California on 26 September 2021, passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived in French Guiana on 12 October 2021.

=== Cost and schedule issues ===
NASA&#x27;s lifetime cost for the project is expected to be US$9.7 billion, of which US$8.8 billion was spent on spacecraft design and development and US$861 million is planned to support five years of mission operations. Representatives from ESA and CSA stated their project contributions amount to approximately €700 million and CA$200 million, respectively.

A study in 1984 by the Space Science Board estimated that to build a next-generation infrared observatory in orbit would cost US$4 billion (US$7B in 2006 dollars, or $10B in 2020 dollars). While this came close to the final cost of Webb, the first NASA design considered in the late 1990s was more modest, aiming for a $1 billion price tag over 10 years of construction. Over time this design expanded, added funding for contingencies, and had scheduling delays.

By 2008, when the project entered preliminary design review and was formally confirmed for construction, over US$1 billion had already been spent on developing the telescope, and the total budget was estimated at US$5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review (CDR) with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski to call for external review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of US$1.5 billion (for a total of US$6.5 billion). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost.

On 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives&#x27; appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed US$1.9 billion from NASA&#x27;s overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for Webb. US$3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day. The committee charged that the project was &quot;billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management&quot;. In response, the American Astronomical Society issued a statement in support of Webb, as did Senator Mikulski. A number of editorials supporting Webb appeared in the international press during 2011 as well. In November 2011, Congress reversed plans to cancel Webb and instead capped additional funding to complete the project at US$8 billion.

While similar issues had affected other major NASA projects such as the Hubble telescope, some scientists expressed concerns about growing costs and schedule delays for the Webb telescope, worrying that its budget might be competing with those of other space science programs. A 2010 &quot;Nature&quot; article described Webb as &quot;the telescope that ate astronomy&quot;. NASA continued to defend the budget and timeline of the program to Congress.

In 2018, Gregory L. Robinson was appointed as the new director of the Webb program. Robinson was credited with raising the program&#x27;s schedule efficiency (how many measures were completed on time) from 50% to 95%. For his role in improving the performance of the Webb program, Robinsons&#x27;s supervisor, Thomas Zurbuchen, called him &quot;the most effective leader of a mission I have ever seen in the history of NASA.&quot; In July 2022, after Webb&#x27;s commissioning process was complete and it began transmitting its first data, Robinson retired following a 33-year career at NASA.

On 27 March 2018, NASA pushed back the launch to May 2020 or later, with a final cost estimate to come after a new launch window was determined with the ESA. In 2019, its mission cost cap was increased by US$800 million. After launch windows were paused in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Webb was launched at the end of 2021, with a total cost of just under US$10 billion.

No single area drove the cost. For future large telescopes, there are five major areas critical to controlling overall cost:
* System complexity
* Critical path and overhead
* Verification challenges
* Programmatic constraints
* Early integration and test considerations

=== Partnership ===
NASA, ESA and CSA have collaborated on the telescope since 1996. ESA&#x27;s participation in construction and launch was approved by its members in 2003 and an agreement was signed between ESA and NASA in 2007. In exchange for full partnership, representation and access to the observatory for its astronomers, ESA is providing the NIRSpec instrument, the Optical Bench Assembly of the MIRI instrument, an Ariane 5 ECA launcher, and manpower to support operations. The CSA provided the Fine Guidance Sensor and the Near-Infrared Imager Slitless Spectrograph and manpower to support operations.

Several thousand scientists, engineers, and technicians spanning 15 countries have contributed to the build, test and integration of Webb. A total of 258 companies, government agencies, and academic institutions participated in the pre-launch project; 142 from the United States, 104 from 12 European countries (including 21 from the U.K., 16 from France, 12 from Germany and 7 international), and 12 from Canada. Other countries as NASA partners, such as Australia, were involved in post-launch operation.

=== Naming concerns ===

In 2002, NASA administrator (2001–2004) Sean O&#x27;Keefe made the decision to name the telescope after James E. Webb, the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and much of the Apollo programs.

In 2015, concerns were raised around Webb&#x27;s possible role in the lavender scare, the mid-20th-century persecution by the U.S. government targeting homosexuals in federal employment. In 2022, NASA released a report of an investigation, based on an examination of more than 50,000 documents. The report found &quot;no available evidence directly links Webb to any actions or follow-up related to the firing of individuals for their sexual orientation&quot;, either in his time in the State Department or at NASA.

== Mission goals ==
The James Webb Space Telescope has four key goals:
* to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe after the Big Bang
* to study galaxy formation and evolution
* to understand star formation and planet formation
* to study planetary systems and the origins of life

These goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason, Webb&#x27;s instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like the Hubble Telescope, but will have a much greater capacity to perform infrared astronomy. Webb will be sensitive to a range of wavelengths from 0.6 to 28 μm (corresponding respectively to orange light and deep infrared radiation at about ).

Webb may be used to gather information on the dimming light of star KIC 8462852, which was discovered in 2015, and has some abnormal light-curve properties.

Additionally, it will be able to tell if an exoplanet has methane in its atmosphere, allowing astronomers to determine whether or not the methane is a biosignature.

=== Orbit design ===

Webb orbits the Sun near the second Lagrange point () of the Sun–Earth system, which is farther from the Sun than the Earth&#x27;s orbit, and about four times farther than the Moon&#x27;s orbit. Normally an object circling the Sun farther out than Earth would take longer than one year to complete its orbit. But near the point, the combined gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun allow a spacecraft to orbit the Sun in the same time that it takes the Earth. Staying close to Earth allows data rates to be much faster for a given size of antenna.

The telescope circles about the Sun–Earth point in a halo orbit, which is inclined with respect to the ecliptic, has a radius varying between about and , and takes about half a year to complete. Since is just an equilibrium point with no gravitational pull, a halo orbit is not an orbit in the usual sense: the spacecraft is actually in orbit around the Sun, and the halo orbit can be thought of as controlled drifting to remain in the vicinity of the point. This requires some station-keeping: around per year from the total ∆&quot;v&quot; budget of . Two sets of thrusters constitute the observatory&#x27;s propulsion system. Because the thrusters are located solely on the Sun-facing side of the observatory, all station-keeping operations are designed to slightly undershoot the required amount of thrust in order to avoid pushing Webb beyond the semi-stable point, a situation which would be unrecoverable. Randy Kimble, the Integration and Test Project Scientist for the JWST, compared the precise station-keeping of Webb to &quot;Sisyphus [...] rolling this rock up the gentle slope near the top of the hill – we never want it to roll over the crest and get away from him&quot;.
=== Infrared astronomy ===

Webb is the formal successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is on infrared astronomy, it is also a successor to the Spitzer Space Telescope. Webb will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars and galaxies. Observing in the infrared spectrum is a key technique for achieving this, because of cosmological redshift, and because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas. This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared spectrum, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes a space telescope preferable for infrared observation.

The more distant an object is, the younger it appears; its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because the universe is expanding, as the light travels it becomes red-shifted, and objects at extreme distances are therefore easier to see if viewed in the infrared. Webb&#x27;s infrared capabilities are expected to let it see back in time to the first galaxies forming just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.

Infrared radiation can pass more freely through regions of cosmic dust that scatter visible light. Observations in infrared allow the study of objects and regions of space which would be obscured by gas and dust in the visible spectrum, such as the molecular clouds where stars are born, the circumstellar disks that give rise to planets, and the cores of active galaxies.

Relatively cool objects (temperatures less than several thousand degrees) emit their radiation primarily in the infrared, as described by Planck&#x27;s law. As a result, most objects that are cooler than stars are better studied in the infrared. This includes the clouds of the interstellar medium, brown dwarfs, planets both in our own and other solar systems, comets, and Kuiper belt objects that will be observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).

Some of the missions in infrared astronomy that impacted Webb development were Spitzer and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Spitzer showed the importance of mid-infrared, which is helpful for tasks such as observing dust disks around stars. Also, the WMAP probe showed the universe was &quot;lit up&quot; at redshift 17, further underscoring the importance of the mid-infrared. Both these missions were launched in the early 2000s, in time to influence Webb development.

== Ground support and operations ==
The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), in Baltimore, Maryland, on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University, was selected in 2003 as the Science and Operations Center (S&amp;OC) for Webb with an initial budget of US$162.2 million intended to support operations through the first year after launch. In this capacity, STScI was to be responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to the astronomical community. Data was to be transmitted from Webb to the ground via the NASA Deep Space Network, processed and calibrated at STScI, and then distributed online to astronomers worldwide. Similar to how Hubble is operated, anyone, anywhere in the world, will be allowed to submit proposals for observations. Each year several committees of astronomers will peer review the submitted proposals to select the projects to observe in the coming year. The authors of the chosen proposals will typically have one year of private access to the new observations, after which the data will become publicly available for download by anyone from the online archive at STScI.

The bandwidth and digital throughput of the satellite is designed to operate at 458 gigabits of data per day for the length of the mission (equivalent to a sustained rate of 5.42 Mbps). Most of the data processing on the telescope is done by conventional single-board computers. The digitization of the analog data from the instruments is performed by the custom SIDECAR ASIC (System for Image Digitization, Enhancement, Control And Retrieval Application Specific Integrated Circuit). NASA stated that the SIDECAR ASIC will include all the functions of a instrument box in a package and consume only 11 milliwatts of power. Since this conversion must be done close to the detectors, on the cold side of the telescope, the low power dissipation is crucial for maintaining the low temperature required for optimal operation of Webb.

The telescope is equipped with a solid-state drive (SSD) with a capacity of 68 GB, used as temporary storage for data collected from its scientific instruments. By the end of the 10-year mission, the usable capacity of the drive is expected to decrease to 60 GB due to the effects of radiation and read/write operations.

=== Micrometeoroid strike ===
The C3 mirror segment suffered a micrometeoroid strike from a large dust mote-sized particle between 23 and 25 May, the fifth and largest strike since launch, reported 8 June 2022, which required engineers to compensate for the strike using a mirror actuator. Despite the strike, a NASA characterization report states &quot;all JWST observing modes have been reviewed and confirmed to be ready for science use&quot; as of 10 July 2022.

== From launch through commissioning ==
=== Launch ===

The launch (designated Ariane flight VA256) took place as scheduled at 12:20 UTC on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket that lifted off from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The telescope was confirmed to be receiving power, starting a two-week deployment phase of its parts and traveling to its target destination. The telescope was released from the upper stage 27 minutes 7 seconds after launch, beginning a 30-day adjustment to place the telescope in a Lissajous orbit around the L2 Lagrange point.

The telescope was launched with slightly less speed than needed to reach its final orbit, and slowed down as it travelled away from Earth, in order to reach L2 with only the velocity needed to enter its orbit there. The telescope reached L2 on 24 January 2022. The flight included three planned course corrections to adjust its speed and direction. This is because the observatory could recover from underthrust (going too slowly), but could not recover from overthrust (going too fast) – to protect highly temperature-sensitive instruments, the sunshield must remain between telescope and Sun, so the spacecraft could not turn around or use its thrusters to slow down.

An orbit is unstable, so JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around L2 (known as station-keeping) to prevent the telescope from drifting away from its orbital position. It was designed to carry enough propellant for 10 years, but the precision of the Ariane 5 launch and the first midcourse correction were credited with saving enough onboard fuel that JWST may be able to maintain its orbit for around 20 years instead. Space.com called the launch &quot;flawless&quot;.

=== Transit and structural deployment ===

Webb was released from the rocket upper stage 27 minutes after a flawless launch. Starting 31 minutes after launch, and continuing for about 13 days, Webb began the process of deploying its solar array, antenna, sunshield, and mirrors. Nearly all deployment actions are commanded by the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, except for two early automatic steps, solar panel unfolding and communication antenna deployment. The mission was designed to give ground controllers flexibility to change or modify the deployment sequence in case of problems.
At 7:50p.m. EST on 25 December 2021, about 12 hours after launch, the telescope&#x27;s pair of primary rockets began firing for 65 minutes to make the first of three planned mid-course corrections. On day two, the high gain communication antenna deployed automatically.

On 27 December 2021, at 60 hours after launch, Webb&#x27;s rockets fired for nine minutes and 27 seconds to make the second of three mid-course corrections for the telescope to arrive at its L2 destination. On 28 December 2021, three days after launch, mission controllers began the multi-day deployment of Webb&#x27;s all-important sunshield. On 30 December 2021, controllers successfully completed two more steps in unpacking the observatory. First, commands deployed the aft &quot;momentum flap&quot;, a device that provides balance against solar pressure on the sunshield, saving fuel by reducing the need for thruster firing to maintain Webb&#x27;s orientation.

On 31 December 2021, the ground team extended the two telescoping &quot;mid booms&quot; from the left and right sides of the observatory. The left side deployed in 3 hours and 19 minutes; the right side took 3 hours and 42 minutes. Commands to separate and tension the membranes followed between 3 and 4 January and were successful. On 5 January 2022, mission control successfully deployed the telescope&#x27;s secondary mirror, which locked itself into place to a tolerance of about one and a half millimeters.

The last step of structural deployment was to unfold the wings of the primary mirror. Each panel consists of three primary mirror segments and had to be folded to allow the space telescope to be installed in the fairing of the Ariane rocket for the launch of the telescope. On 7 January 2022, NASA deployed and locked in place the port-side wing, and on 8 January, the starboard-side mirror wing. This successfully completed the structural deployment of the observatory.

On 24 January 2022, at 2:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time, nearly a month after launch, a third and final course correction took place, inserting Webb into its planned halo orbit around the Sun–Earth L2 point.

The MIRI instrument has four observing modes – imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy, medium-resolution spectroscopy and coronagraphic imaging. &quot;On Aug. 24, a mechanism that supports medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS), exhibited what appears to be increased friction during setup for a science observation. This mechanism is a grating wheel that allows scientists to select between short, medium, and longer wavelengths when making observations using the MRS mode,&quot; said NASA in a press statement.

===Commissioning and testing===
On 12 January 2022, while still in transit, mirror alignment began. The primary mirror segments and secondary mirror were moved away from their protective launch positions. This took about 10 days, because the 132 actuator motors are designed to fine-tune the mirror positions at microscopic accuracy (10 nanometer increments) and must each move over 1.2 million increments (12.5 mm) during initial alignment.

Mirror alignment requires each of the 18 mirror segments, and the secondary mirror, to be positioned to within 50 nanometers. NASA compares the required accuracy by analogy: &quot;If the Webb primary mirror were the size of the United States, each [mirror] segment would be the size of Texas, and the team would need to line the height of those Texas-sized segments up with each other to an accuracy of about 1.5 inches&quot;.

Mirror alignment was a complex operation split into seven phases, that had been repeatedly rehearsed using a 1:6 scale model of the telescope. Once the mirrors reached , NIRCam targeted the 6th magnitude star HD 84406 in Ursa Major. To do this, NIRCam took 1560 images of the sky and used these wide-ranging images to determine where in the sky each segment of the main mirror initially pointed. At first, the individual primary mirror segments were greatly misaligned, so the image contained 18 separate, blurry, images of the star field, each containing an image of the target star. The 18 images of HD 84406 are matched to their respective mirror segments, and the 18 segments are brought into approximate alignment centered on the star (&quot;Segment Image Identification&quot;). Each segment was then individually corrected of its major focusing errors, using a technique called phase retrieval, resulting in 18 separate good quality images from the 18 mirror segments (&quot;Segment Alignment&quot;). The 18 images from each segment, were then moved so they precisely overlap to create a single image (&quot;Image Stacking&quot;).

With the mirrors positioned for almost correct images, they had to be fine tuned to their operational accuracy of 50 nanometers, less than one wavelength of the light that will be detected. A technique called &quot;dispersed fringe sensing&quot; was used to compare images from 20 pairings of mirrors, allowing most of the errors to be corrected (&quot;Coarse Phasing&quot;), and then introduced light defocus to each segment&#x27;s image, allowing detection and correction of almost all remaining errors (&quot;Fine Phasing&quot;). These two processes were repeated three times, and Fine Phasing will be routinely checked throughout the telescope&#x27;s operation. After three rounds of Coarse and Fine Phasing, the telescope was well aligned at one place in the NIRCam field of view. Measurements will be made at various points in the captured image, across all instruments, and corrections calculated from the detected variations in intensity, giving a well-aligned outcome across all instruments (&quot;Telescope Alignment Over Instrument Fields of View&quot;). Finally, a last round of Fine Phasing and checks of image quality on all instruments was performed, to ensure that any small residual errors remaining from the previous steps, were corrected (&quot;Iterate Alignment for Final Correction&quot;). The telescope&#x27;s mirror segments were then aligned and able to capture precise focused images.

In preparation for alignment, NASA announced at 19:28 UTC on 3 February 2022, that NIRCam had detected the telescope&#x27;s first photons (although not yet complete images). On 11 February 2022, NASA announced the telescope had almost completed phase 1 of alignment, with every segment of its primary mirror having located and imaged the target star HD 84406, and all segments brought into approximate alignment. Phase 1 alignment was completed on 18 February 2022, and a week later, phases 2 and 3 were also completed. This meant the 18 segments were working in unison, however until all 7 phases are complete, the segments were still acting as 18 smaller telescopes rather than one larger one. At the same time as the primary mirror was being commissioned, hundreds of other instrument commissioning and calibration tasks were also ongoing.

== Allocation of observation time ==
Webb observing time is allocated through a General Observers (GO) program, a Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program, and a Director&#x27;s Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) program. The GTO program provides guaranteed observing time for scientists who developed hardware and software components for the observatory. The GO program provides all astronomers the opportunity to apply for observing time and will represent the bulk of the observing time. GO programs are selected through peer review by a Time Allocation Committee (TAC), similar to the proposal review process used for the Hubble Space Telescope.

=== Early Release Science program ===
In November 2017, the Space Telescope Science Institute announced the selection of 13 Director&#x27;s Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) programs, chosen through a competitive proposal process. The observations for these programs – Early Release Observations (ERO) – were to be obtained during the first five months of Webb science operations after the end of the commissioning period. A total of 460 hours of observing time was awarded to these 13 programs, which span science topics including the Solar System, exoplanets, stars and star formation, nearby and distant galaxies, gravitational lenses, and quasars. These 13 ERS programs were to use a total of 242.8 hours of observing time on the telescope (not including Webb observing overheads and slew time).

=== General Observer Program ===
For GO Cycle 1 there were 6,000 hours of observation time available to allocate, and 1,173 proposals were submitted requesting a total of 24,500 hours of observation time. Selection of Cycle 1 GO programs was announced on 30 March 2021, with 266 programs approved. These included 13 large programs and treasury programs producing data for public access. The Cycle 2 GO program was announced on 10 May 2023. Webb science observations are nominally scheduled in weekly increments. The observation plan for every week is published on Mondays by the Space Telescope Science Institute. In Cycle 4 the telescope showed its continued popularity in the astronomy community by garnering 2,377 proposals for 78,000 hours of observing time, nine times more than the available amount.

== Scientific results ==
The JWST completed its commissioning and was ready to begin full scientific operations on 11 July 2022. With some exceptions, most experiment data is kept private for one year for the exclusive use of scientists running that particular experiment, and then the raw data will be released to the public. JWST observations substantially advanced understanding of exoplanets, the first billion years of the universe, and many other astrophysical and cosmological phenomena.

=== First full-color images ===
The first full-color images and spectroscopic data were released on 12 July 2022, which also marked the official beginning of Webb&#x27;s general science operations. U.S. President Joe Biden revealed the first image, &quot;Webb&#x27;s First Deep Field&quot;, on 11 July 2022. Additional releases around this time include:
* Carina Nebula young, star-forming region called NGC 3324 about 8,500 light-years from Earth, described by NASA as &quot;Cosmic Cliffs&quot;.
* WASP-96b including an analysis of atmosphere with evidence of water around a giant gas planet orbiting a distant star 1120 light-years from Earth.
* Southern Ring Nebula clouds of gas and dust expelled by a dying star 2,500 light-years from Earth.
* Stephan&#x27;s Quintet a visual display of five galaxies with colliding gas and dust clouds creating new stars; four central galaxies are 290 million light-years from Earth.
* SMACS J0723.3-7327 a galaxy cluster at redshift 0.39, with distant background galaxies whose images are distorted and magnified due to gravitational lensing by the cluster. This image has been called &quot;Webb&#x27;s First Deep Field&quot;. It was later discovered that in this picture the JWST had also revealed three ancient galaxies that existed shortly after the Big Bang. Its images of these distant galaxies are views of the universe 13.1 billion years ago.
On 14 July 2022, NASA presented images of Jupiter and related areas by the JWST, including infrared views.

In a preprint released around the same time, NASA, ESA and CSA scientists stated that &quot;almost across the board, the science performance of JWST is better than expected&quot;. The document described a series of observations during the commissioning, when the instruments captured spectra of transiting exoplanets with a precision better than 1000 ppm per data point, and tracked moving objects with speeds up to 67 milliarcseconds/second, more than twice as fast as the requirement. It also obtained the spectra of hundreds of stars simultaneously in a dense field towards the Milky Way&#x27;s Galactic Center. Other targets included:
* Moving targets: Jupiter&#x27;s rings and moons (particularly Europa, Thebe and Metis), asteroids 2516 Roman, 118 Peitho, 6481 Tenzing, 1773 Rumpelstilz, 216 Kleopatra, 2035 Stearns, 4015 Wilson-Harrington and 
* NIRCam grism time-series, NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec BOTS mode: the Jupiter-sized planet HAT-P-14b
* NIRISS aperture masking interferometry (AMI): A clear detection of the very low-mass companion star AB Doradus C, which had a separation of only 0.3 arcseconds to the primary. This observation was the first demonstration of AMI in space.
* MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS): a hot super-Earth planet L 168-9 b (TOI-134) around a bright M-dwarf star (red dwarf star)

=== Bright early galaxies ===
Within two weeks of the first Webb images, several preprint papers described a wide range of high redshift and very luminous (presumably large) galaxies believed to date from 235 million years (z=16.7) to 280 million years after the Big Bang, far earlier than previously known. On 17 August 2022, NASA released a large mosaic image of 690 individual frames taken by the NIRCam on Webb of numerous very early galaxies. Some early galaxies observed by Webb like CEERS-93316, which has an estimated redshift of approximately z=16.7 corresponding to 235.8 million years after the Big Bang, are high redshift galaxy candidates. In September 2022, primordial black holes were proposed as explaining these unexpectedly large and early galaxies. In May 2024, the JWST identified the most distant known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0, seen just 290 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of 14.32. Part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), this discovery highlights a galaxy significantly more luminous and massive than expected for such an early period. Detailed analysis using JWST&#x27;s NIRSpec and MIRI instruments revealed this galaxy&#x27;s remarkable properties, including its significant size and dust content, challenging current models of early galaxy formation.

=== Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations ===
In June 2023 detection of organic molecules 12 billion light-years away in a galaxy called SPT0418-47 using the Webb telescope was announced.

On 12 July 2023, NASA celebrated the first year of operations with the release of Webb&#x27;s image of a small star-forming region in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, 390 light years away.

In September 2023, two astrophysicists questioned the accepted Standard Model of Cosmology, based on the latest JWST studies.

In December 2023, NASA released Christmas holiday-related images by JWST, including the Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster and others.

In May 2024, the JWST detected the farthest known black hole merger. Occurring within the galaxy system ZS7, 740 million years after the Big Bang, this discovery suggests a fast growth rate for black holes through mergers, even in the young Universe.

<text>Refrancore (Piedmontese: &quot;Ël Francó&quot; or &quot;Arfrancor&quot;) is a village and &quot;comune&quot; in the northwestern Italian province of Asti in the Piedmont region, located some east of Asti in the Basso Monferrato. The territory of the &quot;comune&quot; extends over an area of and is largely devoted to agriculture, in particular to vineyards growing the Grignolino and Barbera wine grapes.

Although having only around 1,600 official residents, the population and activity within the village is enhanced by the presence of holiday homes and surrounding hamlets which officially lie within other village boundaries.

==History and main sights==
The name Refrancore derives from a battle fought between the Franks and Lombards. The battle was won by the Lombards and the blood spilt by the Franks tinted a local stream red giving the area the Latin name &quot;Rivus ex sanguine Francorum&quot; which literally means “A stream full of the Franks’ blood”. This became abbreviated to &quot;Rivusfrancorum&quot; and eventually Refrancore.

At one time there was a small castle on the hill above the village, a drawing of which appears in the Codex Astensis. The last remains of the castle were razed in the 19th century in preparation for the construction of a church which was never actually built.

On the hill near the site of the Castle there is a 15th-century &quot;ricetto&quot; fort which has remained almost entirely intact. Presently it is used as a kindergarten and old people&#x27;s home. The chapel which was part of the fort has been restored.

In the main square there is a clock tower which is all that remains of the 18th-century parish church which was demolished at the start of the 20th century.

<text>A pitch-accent language is a type of language that, when spoken, has certain syllables in words or morphemes that are prominent, as indicated by a distinct contrasting pitch (linguistic tone) rather than by loudness or length, as in some other languages like English. Pitch-accent languages also contrast with fully tonal languages like Vietnamese, Thai and Standard Chinese, in which practically every syllable can have an independent tone. Some scholars have claimed that the term &quot;pitch accent&quot; is not coherently defined and that pitch-accent languages are just a sub-category of tonal languages in general.

Languages that have been described as pitch-accent languages include: most dialects of Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Baltic languages, Ancient Greek, Vedic Sanskrit, Tlingit, Turkish, Japanese, Limburgish, Norwegian, Swedish of Sweden, Western Basque, Yaqui, certain dialects of Korean, Shanghainese, and Livonian.

Pitch-accent languages tend to fall into two categories: those with a single pitch-contour (for example, high, or highlow) on the accented syllable, such as Tokyo Japanese, Western Basque, or Persian; and those in which more than one pitch-contour can occur on the accented syllable, such as Punjabi, Swedish, or Serbo-Croatian. In this latter kind, the accented syllable is also often stressed another way.

Some of the languages considered pitch-accent languages, in addition to accented words, also have accentless words (e.g., Japanese and Western Basque); in others all major words are accented (e.g., Blackfoot and Barasana).

The term &quot;pitch accent&quot; is also used to denote a different feature, namely the use of pitch when speaking to give selective prominence (accent) to a syllable or mora within a phrase.

==Characteristics of pitch-accent languages==
===Definitions===
Scholars give various definitions of a pitch-accent language. A typical definition is as follows: &quot;Pitch-accent systems [are] systems in which one syllable is more prominent than the other syllables in the same word, a prominence that is achieved by means of pitch&quot; (Zanten and Dol (2010)). That is to say, in a pitch-accent language, in order to indicate how a word is pronounced it is necessary, as with a stress-accent language, to mark only one syllable in a word as accented, not specify the tone of every syllable. This feature of having only one prominent syllable in a word or morpheme is known as &quot;culminativity&quot;.

Another property suggested for pitch-accent languages to distinguish them from stress languages is that &quot;Pitch accent languages must satisfy the criterion of having &quot;invariant tonal contours&quot; on accented syllables ... This is not so for pure stress languages, where the tonal contours of stressed syllables can vary freely&quot; (Hayes (1995)). Although this is true of many pitch-accent languages, there are others, such as the Franconian dialects, in which the contours vary, for example between declarative and interrogative sentences.

According to another proposal, pitch-accent languages &quot;can only use F0&quot; (i.e., pitch) to mark the accented syllable, whereas stress languages may also use duration and intensity (Beckman). However, other scholars disagree, and find that intensity and duration can also play a part in the accent of pitch-accent languages.

A feature considered characteristic of stress-accent languages is that a stress-accent is &quot;obligatory&quot;, that is, that every major word has to have an accent. This is not always true of pitch-accent languages, some of which, like Japanese and Northern Bizkaian Basque, have accentless words. But there are also some pitch-accent languages in which every word has an accent.

One feature shared between pitch-accent languages and stress-accent languages is &quot;demarcativeness&quot;: prominence peaks tend to occur at or near morpheme edges (word/stem initial, word/stem penult, word/stem final).

Often, however, the difference between a pitch-accent language, a stress-accent language, and tonal language is not clear. &quot;It is, in fact, often not straightforward to decide whether a particular pitch system is best described as tonal or accentual. ... Since raised pitch, especially when it coincides with vowel length, makes a syllable perceptually more prominent, it can often require detailed phonetic and phonological analysis to disentangle whether pitch is playing a more stress-like or a more tone-like role in a particular language&quot; (Downing).

Larry Hyman argues that tone is made up of a variety of different typological features, which can be mixed and matched with some independence from each other. Hyman claims that there can be no coherent definition of pitch-accent, as the term describes languages that have non-prototypical combinations of tone system properties (or both a tone system, usually still non-prototypical, and a stress system simultaneously). Since all pitch-accent languages can be analysed just as well in purely tonal terms, in Hyman&#x27;s view, the term &quot;pitch-accent&quot; should be superseded by a wider understanding of what qualifies as a tone system - thus, all &quot;pitch-accent&quot; languages are tone languages, and there is simply more variety within tone systems than has historically been admitted.

===Characteristics of the accent===
====High vs. low accent====
When one particular tone is marked in a language in contrast to unmarked syllables, it is usual for it to be a high tone. There are, however, a few languages in which the marked tone is a low tone, for example the Dogrib language of northwestern Canada, the Kansai dialect of Japanese, and certain Bantu languages of the Congo such as Ciluba and Ruund.

====Disyllabic accents====
One difference between a pitch accent and a stress accent is that it is not uncommon for a pitch accent to be realised over two syllables. Thus in Serbo-Croatian, the difference between a &quot;rising&quot; and a &quot;falling&quot; accent is observed only in the pitch of the syllable following the accent: the accent is said to be &quot;rising&quot; if the following syllable is as high as or higher than the accented syllable, but &quot;falling&quot; if it is lower (see Serbo-Croatian phonology#Pitch accent).

In Vedic Sanskrit, the ancient Indian grammarians described the accent as being a high pitch (&quot;udātta&quot;) followed by a falling tone (&quot;svarita&quot;) on the following syllable; but occasionally, when two syllables had merged, the high tone and the falling tone were combined on one syllable.

In Standard Swedish, the difference between accent 1 and accent 2 can only be heard in words of two or more syllables, since the tones take two syllables to be realised. In Värmland as well as Norrland accent 1 and 2 can be heard in monosyllabic words however. In the central Swedish dialect of Stockholm, accent 1 is an LHL contour and accent 2 is an HLHL contour, with the second peak in the second syllable.

In Welsh, in most words the accent is realised as a low tone on the penultimate syllable (which is also stressed) followed by a high tone on the final; but in some dialects this LH contour may take place entirely within the penultimate syllable.

Similarly in the Chichewa language of Malawi a tone on a final syllable often spreads backwards to the penultimate syllable, so that the word is actually pronounced &quot;Chichēwā&quot; with two mid-tones, or &quot;Chichěwā&quot;, with a rising tone on the penultimate syllable. Sentence-finally it can become &quot;Chichěwà&quot; with a rising tone on the penultimate and a low tone on the final.

====Peak delay====
A phenomenon observed in a number of languages, both fully tonal ones and those with pitch-accent systems, is peak delay. In this, the high point (peak) of a high tone does not synchronise exactly with the syllable itself, but is reached at the beginning of the following syllable, giving the impression that the high tone has spread over two syllables. The Vedic Sanskrit accent described above has been interpreted as an example of peak delay.

====One-mora accents====
Conversely, a pitch accent in some languages can target just part of a syllable, if the syllable is bi-moraic. Thus in Luganda, in the word &quot;Baganda people&quot; the accent is considered to occur on the first mora of the syllable &quot;ga(n)&quot;, but in &quot;Buganda (region)&quot; it occurs on the second half (with spreading back to the first half). In Ancient Greek, similarly, in the word () &quot;houses&quot; the accent is on the first half of the syllable &quot;oi&quot;, but in () &quot;at home&quot; on the second half. An alternative analysis is to see Luganda and Ancient Greek as belonging to the type of languages where there is a choice of different contours on an accented syllable.

===High tone spread===
====Anticipation====
In some pitch-accent languages, the high pitch of the accent can be anticipated in the preceding syllable or syllables, for example, Japanese &quot;head&quot;, Basque &quot;the friend&#x27;s grandmother&quot;, Turkish &quot;you would not get angry&quot;, Belgrade Serbian &quot;pepper&quot;, Ancient Greek &quot;it demands&quot;.

====Forwards spreading====
Forwards spreading of a tone is also common in some languages. For example, in the Northern Ndebele language of Zimbabwe, the tonal accent on the prefix &quot;ú-&quot; spreads forward to all the syllables in the word except the last two: &quot;to laugh&quot;; &quot;to make one another laugh&quot;. Sometimes the sequence HHHH then becomes LLLH, so that in the related language Zulu, the equivalent of these words is and with an accent shifted to the antepenultimate syllable.

In Yaqui, the accent is signalled by an upstep before the accented syllable. The high pitch continues after the accent, declining slightly, until the next accented syllable. Thus it is the opposite of Japanese, where the accent is preceded by high pitch, and its position is signalled by a downstep after the accented syllable.

====Plateau between accents====
In other languages the high pitch of an accent, instead of dropping to a low on the following syllable, in some circumstances can continue in a plateau to the next accented syllable, as in Luganda &quot;it is in Buganda&quot; (contrast &quot;it is in Bunyoro&quot;, in which &quot;Bunyóró&quot; is unaccented apart from automatic default tones).

Plateauing is also found in Chichewa, where in some circumstances a sequence of HLH can change to HHH. For example, + &quot;with a bicycle&quot; makes with a plateau.

In Western Basque and Luganda, the default high tones automatically added to accentless words can spread in a continuous plateau through the phrase as far as the first accent, for example, in Basque &quot;John&#x27;s friend&#x27;s grandmother&quot;, Luganda &quot;people in the city&quot;.

===Simple pitch-accent languages===
According to the first two criteria above, the Tokyo dialect of Japanese is often considered a typical pitch-accent language, since the pronunciation of any word can be specified by marking just one syllable as accented, and in every word the accent is realised by a fall in pitch immediately after the accented syllable. In the examples below the accented syllable is marked in bold (the particle &quot;ga&quot; indicates that the word is subject):
* &quot;pillow&quot;
* &quot;you&quot;
* &quot;head&quot;
* &quot;fish&quot; (unaccented)

In Japanese there are also other high-toned syllables, which are added to the word automatically, but these do not count as accents, since they are not followed by a low syllable. As can be seen, some of the words in Japanese have no accent.

In Proto-Indo-European and its descendant, Vedic Sanskrit, the system is comparable to Tokyo Japanese and Cupeño in most respects, specifying pronunciation through inherently accented morphemes such as and (Vedic &quot;-rá-&quot; and &quot;-tá-&quot;) and inherently unaccented morphemes. The examples below demonstrate the formation of such words using morphemes:
* PIE &gt; &quot;&quot; &quot;shining&quot; (Vedic &quot;r̥jrás&quot;)
* PIE &gt; &quot;&quot; &quot;heard (of), famous&quot; (Vedic &quot;śrutás&quot;)

If there are multiple accented morphemes, the accent is determined by specific morphophonological principles. Below is a comparison of Vedic, Tokyo Japanese and Cupeño regarding accent placement:
* Vedic /&quot;gáv-ā́&quot;/ &gt; &quot;gáv-ā&quot; &quot;with the cow&quot;
* Japanese /&quot;yón-dára&quot;/ &gt; &quot;yón-dara&quot; &quot;if (he) reads&quot;
* Cupeño /&quot;ʔáyu-qá&quot;/ &gt; &quot;ʔáyu-qa&quot; &quot;(he) wants&quot;

The Basque language has a system very similar to Japanese. In some Basque dialects, as in Tokyo Japanese, there are accented and unaccented words; in other dialects all major words have an accent. As with Japanese, the accent in Basque consists of a high pitch followed by a fall on the next syllable.

Turkish is another language often considered a pitch-accent language (see Turkish phonology#Word-accent). In some circumstances, for example in the second half of a compound, the accent can disappear.

Persian has also been called a pitch-accent language in recent studies, although the high tone of the accent is also accompanied by stress; and as with Turkish, in some circumstances the accent can be neutralised and disappear. Because the accent is both stressed and high-pitched, Persian can be considered intermediate between a pitch-accent language and a stress-accent language.

===More complex pitch accents===
In some simple pitch-accent languages, such as Ancient Greek, the accent on a long vowel or diphthong could be on either half of the vowel, making a contrast possible between a rising accent and a falling one; compare () &quot;at home&quot; vs. () &quot;houses&quot;. Similarly in Luganda, in bimoraic syllables a contrast is possible between a level and falling accent: &quot;Buganda (region)&quot;, vs. &quot;Baganda (people)&quot;. However, such contrasts are not common or systematic in these languages.

In more complex types of pitch-accent languages, although there is still only one accent per word, there is a systematic contrast of more than one pitch-contour on the accented syllable, for example, H vs. HL in the Colombian language Barasana, accent 1 vs. accent 2 in Swedish and Norwegian, rising vs. falling tone in Serbo-Croatian, and a choice between level (neutral), rising, and falling in Punjabi.

Other languages deviate from a simple pitch accent in more complicated ways. For example, in describing the Osaka dialect of Japanese, it is necessary to specify not only which syllable of a word is accented, but also whether the initial syllable of the word is high or low.

In Luganda the accented syllable is usually followed immediately after the HL of the accent by an automatic default tone, slightly lower than the tone of the accent, e.g., &quot;we are going&quot;; however, there are some words such as &quot;they will see&quot;, where the automatic default tone does not follow the accent immediately but after an interval of two or three syllables. In such words it is therefore necessary to specify not only which syllable has the accent, but where the default tone begins.

Because of the number of ways languages can use tone some linguists, such as the tonal languages specialist Larry Hyman, argue that the category &quot;pitch-accent language&quot; can have no coherent definition, and that all such languages should simply be referred to as &quot;tonal languages&quot;.

==Languages==
===Proto-Indo-European===
The theoretical proto-language Proto-Indo-European, the putative ancestor of most European, Iranian and North Indian languages, is usually reconstructed to have been a free pitch-accent system. (&quot;Free&quot; here refers to the position of the accent since its position was unpredictable by phonological rules and so could be on any syllable of a word, regardless of its structure.) From comparisons with the surviving Indo-European daughter languages, it is generally believed that the accented syllable was higher in pitch than the surrounding syllables. Among daughter languages, a pitch-accent system is found in Vedic Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, the Baltic languages and some South Slavic languages, although none of them preserves the original system intact.

===Vedic Sanskrit===

Vedic Sanskrit, the earliest form of the Indian language Sanskrit, is believed to have had a pitch accent that was very similar to that of ancestor language Proto-Indo-European. Most words had exactly one accented syllable, but there were some unaccented words, such as finite verbs of main clauses, non-initial vocatives, and certain pronouns and particles. Occasionally, a compound word occurred with two accents: &quot;ápa-bhartávai&quot; &quot;to take away&quot;.

The ancient Indian grammarians describe the accented syllable as being &quot;raised&quot; (&quot;udātta&quot;), and it appears that it was followed in the following syllable by a downwards glide, which the grammarians refer to as &quot;sounded&quot; (&quot;svarita&quot;). In some cases, language change merged an accented syllable with a following svarita syllable, and the two were combined in a single syllable, known as &quot;independent svarita&quot;.

The precise descriptions of ancient Indian grammarians imply that the &quot;udātta&quot; was characterised by rising pitch and the &quot;svarita&quot; by falling pitch. In the tradition represented by the Rigveda, a collection of hymns, the highest point of the accent appears not to have been reached until the beginning of the &quot;svarita&quot; syllable. In other words, it was an example of &quot;peak delay&quot; (see above).

In the later stages of Sanskrit, the pitch accent was lost and a stress accent remained. The stress in Sanskrit, however, was weaker than that in English and not free but predictable. The stress was heard on the penultimate syllable of the word if it was heavy, on the antepenultimate if the antepenultimate was heavy and the penultimate light, and otherwise on the pre-antepenultimate.

===Ancient Greek===

In Ancient Greek, one of the final three syllables of a word carried an accent. Each syllable contained one or two vocalic morae, but only one can be accented, and accented morae were pronounced at a higher pitch. In polytonic orthography, accented vowels were marked with the acute accent. Long vowels and diphthongs are thought to have been bimoraic and, if the accent falls on the first mora, were marked with the circumflex. Long vowels and diphthongs that were accented on the first mora had a high–low (falling) pitch contour and, if accented on the second mora, may have had a low–high (rising) pitch contour:

The Ancient Greek accent was melodic, as is suggested by descriptions by ancient grammarians but also by fragments of Greek music such as the Seikilos epitaph, in which most words are set to music that coincides with the accent. For example, the first syllable of the word () is set to three notes rising in pitch, the middle syllable of () is higher in pitch than the other two syllables, and the circumflex accent of () has two notes, the first a third higher than the second.

In addition to the two accents mentioned above (the acute and the circumflex), Ancient Greek also had a grave accent. It was used only on the last syllable of words, as an alternative to an acute. The acute was used when the word was cited in isolation or came before a pause, such as a comma or a full stop, or an enclitic. Otherwise, a grave was written. The exact interpretation of the grave is disputed: it may have indicated that the accent was completely suppressed or that it was partly suppressed but not entirely absent.

By comparing the position of the Ancient Greek and Vedic Sanskrit accents, the accent of the ancestor language Proto-Indo-European can often be reconstructed. For example, in the declension of the word for &quot;father&quot; in these two languages, the position of the accent in some cases is identical:
In later stages of Greek, the accent changed from a pitch accent to a stress accent, but remained largely on the same syllable as in Ancient Greek. The change is thought to have taken place by the 4th century AD. Thus, the word () (&quot;man, person&quot;), which is believed to have been pronounced in ancient times with the first syllable always higher than the other two, is now pronounced with the first syllable either higher or lower than the other two.

===Baltic languages===
Two languages of the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family survive today: Lithuanian and Latvian. (Another Baltic language, Old Prussian, died out in the 18th century.) Both languages have a tonal accent that is believed to derive from the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language.
Possible relationshipsbetween Baltic tones
 Baltic

 / /\ \
 / / F \
 / / | \ \
 F R L B F
 Lith. Latvian

 F – falling (acute)
 R – rising (circumflex)
 L – level
 B – broken

Baltic tones are often classified as either &quot;acute&quot; or &quot;circumflex&quot;. However, these labels indicate a diachronic correspondence rather than a phonetic one. For example, the &quot;acute&quot; accent is falling in Lithuanian but a high level tone in Latvian and is presumed to have been rising in Old Prussian and Classical Greek. The &quot;circumflex&quot; is rising in Lithuanian but falling in Latvian, Prussian and Classical Greek.

In the tree diagram on the right, as adopted from Poljakov, names for (original) Baltic tones have been equated with those of modern Standard Lithuanian and the falling tone in Latvian is depicted as derived from a Baltic rising tone. According to some it was Lithuanian that &quot;switched the places&quot; of the Baltic tones. This might explain why most languages call a rising tone &quot;acute&quot; while in Baltic terminology a falling tone is &quot;acute&quot;. Some controversy surrounds Poljakov&#x27;s model, and it has been harshly criticized by Frederik Kortlandt. Kortlandt contends that broken tone in Latvian and Žemaitian is a reflex of a now disappeared glottal stop in Balto-Slavic not preserved in Aukštaitian (Standard Lithuanian) or Slavic languages and not a recent development of acute.

====Lithuanian====

Long segments in Lithuanian can take one of two accents: rising or falling. &quot;Long segments&quot; are defined as either long vowels, diphthongs or a sequence of a vowel followed by a sonorant if they are in a stressed position. Pitch can serve as the only distinguishing characteristic for minimal pairs that are otherwise orthographically identical, e.g., &quot;kar̃tų&quot; &#x27;time:gen.pl&#x27; vs. &quot;kártų&quot; &#x27;hang:irr.3&#x27; (rising and falling tone indicated by a tilde and an acute accent respectively.)

====Latvian====
In Latvian, long segments (the same criteria as in Lithuanian) can take on one of three pitches (&quot;intonācijas&quot; or more specifically &quot;zilbes intonācijas&quot;) either &quot;stiepta&quot; (&quot;level&quot;), &quot;lauzta&quot; (&quot;broken&quot;) or &quot;krītoša&quot; (&quot;falling&quot;) indicated by Latvian linguists with a tilde, circumflex or a grave accent respectively (in IPA, however, the tilde is replaced by a macron because the former is already reserved to denote nasalized vowels.) Some authors note that the level pitch is realized simply as &quot;ultra long&quot; (or overlong.) Endzelīns (1897) identifies &quot;level diphthongs&quot; as consisting of 3 moras not just two. Broken pitch is, in turn, a falling pitch with superadded glottalization. And, indeed, the similarity between the Latvian broken pitch and Danish stød has been described by several authors. At least in Danish phonology, stød (unlike Norwegian and Swedish pitch accents) is not considered a pitch accent distinction but, rather, variously described as either glottalization, laryngealization, creaky voice or vocal fry. Some authors point out that the so-called broken pitch is not a pitch accent but a &quot;pitch register&quot; distinction similar to the &quot;ngã&quot; register of Northern Vietnamese.

Outside of Central Vidzeme (Standard Latvian), the three-way system has been simplified, in Eastern Latvian (Latgale) only broken and falling pitches are distinguished. Speakers of Rīga Latvian and other more westward varieties differentiate only between level and broken pitches with the falling pitch being merged with the broken one. Thus the Standard Latvian &quot;minimal triplet&quot; or &quot;minimal set&quot; of (hall), (grass) and (medicine) in Rīga Latvian would be reduced to &quot;hall&quot; (level pitch) and &quot;grass&quot; (broken pitch) and &quot;medicine&quot; would be pronounced with a broken pitch just like &quot;grass&quot;. Speakers around Ērgļi tend to have just levelled pitch.

====Livonian====
The extinct Livonian language is a Finnic language rather than Baltic but was influenced by Latvian. In the late 19th century, Danish linguist Vilhelm Thomsen identified a characteristic in the speech of a Livonian sailor that to him seemed very similar to the Danish &quot;stød&quot;. The feature was later the subject of research by several Finno-Ugricists. Although the (Indo-European) Latvian and (Uralic) Livonian are phylogenetically unrelated (being from different language families) both have influenced each other heavily in terms of phonology. Whether Livonian acquired this feature from Latvian or vice versa is debated; however, as Livonian is the only Finno-Ugric language to have this feature, the majority of researchers believe it was a product of Latvian influence on Livonian and not the other way around. It is possible that &quot;Livonian stød&quot; would be classified as a pitch accent only by Latvian classification just like the identical Latvian &quot;lauztā intonācija&quot;, otherwise it would be considered a pitch register, glottalization or similar categories as discussed above.

The Livonian-Estonian-Latvian dictionary at www.murre.ut.ee uses an apostrophe after a vowel to indicate broken pitch, for example, &quot;Mi’nnõn u’m vajāg&quot; instead of just &quot;Minnõn um vajāg&quot;.

===Norwegian and Swedish===
Norwegian and Swedish are stress-accent languages, but in addition to the stress, two-syllable words with the stress on the first syllable in most dialects also have differences in tone. There are two kinds of tonal accent, referred to as the acute and grave accents, but they are also called &quot;accent 1&quot; and &quot;accent 2&quot; or &quot;tone 1&quot; and &quot;tone 2&quot;. Over 150 two-syllable word pairs are differentiated only by their use of the accent. Tone 1 is used generally for words whose second syllable is the definite article and for words that were monosyllabic in Old Norse.

For example, in most Norwegian dialects, the word (farmers) is pronounced with tone 1, while tone 2 is used when pronouncing (beans or prayers). Differences in spelling occasionally let readers distinguish written words, but most minimal pairs are written alike. An example in Swedish is the word , which means &quot;the duck&quot; when using tone 1 and &quot;the spirit&quot; when using tone 2. In some dialects of Swedish, including those spoken in Finland, the distinction is absent. There are significant variations in the realization of pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects), accent 1 is falling, and accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary; but in most of eastern Norway (the so-called low-pitch dialects), accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable.

The word accents give Norwegian and Swedish a &quot;singing&quot; quality that makes them easy to distinguish from other languages. In Danish (except for some southern dialects), the pitch accent of Swedish and Norwegian corresponds to the glottalization phenomenon known as stød.

=== Rhinelandic dialects ===

A pitch accent is found in the following Rhinelandic languages or dialects: Limburgish, Ripuarian and Moselle Franconian (excluding Luxembourgish). They are sometimes collectively referred to as West Central German tonal languages.

In these dialects there is a distinction between two different tonal contours, known as &quot;tonal accent 1&quot; and &quot;tonal accent 2&quot;. As with Lithuanian, the distinction is made only in stressed syllables and, for the most part, only when the syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong or vowel that is followed in the same syllable by a sonorant (&quot;r, l, m, n, ŋ&quot;). No distinction of tones is made in stressed syllables containing a short vowel only. Although the accentual system resembles that of Swedish, the two are thought to have arisen independently. Unlike Swedish, where the distinction in tones is not made in monosyllables (except for in northern and western dialects), in the Franconian dialects it very frequently occurs in monosyllables, e.g., (Ripuarian dialect) &quot;zɛɪ&quot;1 &quot;sieve&quot; vs. &quot;zɛɪ&quot;2 &quot;she&quot;.

The tonal accents are referred to under a variety of names. Tonal accent 1 is called &#x27; (&quot;thrusting tone&quot;) in Dutch or &#x27; in German, while tonal accent 2 is named &quot;&quot; (&quot;slurring tone&quot;) in Dutch and &quot;Schleifton&quot; in German, apparently referring to the double peak it has in areas such as Limburg.

The two accents have different realisations in different dialects. For example, in Cologne, accent 1 has a sharp fall near the beginning of the syllable, and accent 2 remains level for a while before falling. In Arzbach, near Koblenz, on the other hand, accent 1 rises slightly or remains level, while it is accent 2 that falls sharply, that is, more or less the reverse of the Cologne pattern. In Hasselt in Belgian Limburg, accent 1 rises then falls, and with accent 2 there is a fall and then a rise and another fall. The three types are known as Rule A, Rule B and Rule 0, respectively. Although traditionally accent 2 has been analysed as the marked variant, in certain Rule A areas (especially Cologne, where accent 2&#x27;s realization is nigh-indistinguishable from an unpitched long vowel) accent 1 is thought of as the marked variant. Grammars of the Cologne dialect will treat the pitches as &quot;ungeschärft&quot; (accent 2) and &quot;geschärft&quot; (accent 1). Adam Wrede&#x27;s influential dictionary of the Cologne dialect also treats accent 2 as indistinct; the above examples &quot;zɛɪ1&quot; &quot;sieve&quot; and &quot;zɛɪ2&quot; &quot;she,&quot; &quot;they&quot; are transcribed (zeiː) and (zei) respectively. (The differing transcriptions of the vowel are due to the pronunciation being different in Cologne than the surrounding dialects)

It has recently been observed that in interrogative sentences, however, all three types have nearly identical intonations. In all dialects in accent 1, there is then a rise and then a fall. In accent 2, there is then a fall, a rise and then another fall.

Since the contour of the accent changes in different contexts, from declarative to interrogative, those dialects apparently contradict Hayes&#x27;s proposed criterion for a pitch-accent language of the contour of a pitch-accent remaining stable in every context.

===West South Slavic languages===
The West South Slavic languages include Serbo-Croatian (Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian) and Slovenian, spoken in the former Yugoslavia.

The late Proto-Slavic accentual system was based on a fundamental opposition of a short/long circumflex (falling) tone, and an acute (rising) tone, the position of the accent being free as was inherited from Proto-Balto-Slavic. Common Slavic accentual innovations significantly reworked the original system primarily with respect to the position of the accent (Dybo&#x27;s law, Illič-Svityč&#x27;s law, Meillet&#x27;s law etc.), and further developments yielded some new accents, such as the so-called neoacute (Ivšić&#x27;s law), or the new rising tone in Neoštokavian dialects (the so-called &quot;Neoštokavian retraction&quot;).

As opposed to other Slavic dialect subgroups, West South Slavic dialects have largely retained the Proto-Slavic system of free and mobile tonal accent (including the dialect used for basis of Modern Standard Slovene and the Neoštokavian dialect used for the basis of standard varieties of Serbo-Croatian: Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian), though the discrepancy between the codified norm and actual speech may vary significantly.

====Serbo-Croatian====
The Neoštokavian dialect used for the basis of standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian distinguishes four types of pitch accents: short falling (ȅ), short rising (è), long falling (ȇ), and long rising (é). There are also unaccented vowels: long (ē) and short (e). The accent is said to be relatively free, as it can be manifested on any syllable except the last. The long accents are realized by pitch change within the long vowel; the short ones are realized by the pitch difference from the subsequent syllable.

Accent alternations are very frequent in inflectional paradigms by both types of accent and placement in the word (the so-called &quot;mobile paradigms&quot;, which were present in the PIE itself but became much more widespread in Proto-Balto-Slavic). Different inflected forms of the same lexeme can exhibit all four accents: &quot;lònac&quot; &#x27;pot&#x27; (nominative sg.), &quot;lónca&quot; (genitive sg.), &quot;lȏnci&quot; (nominative pl.), &quot;lȍnācā&quot; (genitive pl.).

Restrictions on the distribution of the accent depend on the position of the syllable but also on its quality, as not every kind of accent is manifested in every syllable.
# A falling tone generally occurs in monosyllabic words or the first syllable of a word (&quot;pȃs&quot; &#x27;belt&#x27;, &quot;rȏg&quot; &#x27;horn&#x27;; &quot;bȁba&quot; &#x27;old woman&#x27;, &quot;lȃđa&quot; &#x27;river ship&#x27;; &quot;kȕćica&quot; &#x27;small house&#x27;, Kȃrlovac). The only exception to this rule are the interjections, i.e., words uttered in the state of excitement (&quot;ahȁ&quot;, &quot;ohȏ&quot;)
# A rising tone generally occurs in any syllable of a word except the ultimate and never in monosyllabic words (&quot;vòda&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;, &quot;lúka&quot; &#x27;harbour&#x27;; &quot;lìvada&quot; &#x27;meadow&#x27;, &quot;lúpānje&quot; &#x27;slam&#x27;; &quot;siròta&quot; &#x27;female orphan&#x27;, &quot;počétak&quot; &#x27;beginning&#x27;; &quot;crvotòčina&quot; &#x27;wormhole&#x27;, &quot;oslobođénje&quot; &#x27;liberation&#x27;).

Thus, monosyllables generally have falling tone, and polysyllabic words generally have falling or rising tone on the first syllable and rising in all the other syllables except the last. The tonal opposition rising vs. falling is generally possible only in the first accented syllable of polysyllabic words, but the opposition by length, long vs. short, is possible even in the nonaccented syllable and the post-accented syllable (but not in the preaccented position).

Proclitics (clitics that latch on to a following word), on the other hand, can &quot;steal&quot; a falling tone (but not a rising tone) from the following monosyllabic or disyllabic words (as seen in the examples /vîdiːm/→/ně‿vidiːm/, /ʒěliːm/→/ne‿ʒěliːm/). The stolen accent is always short and may end up being either falling or rising on the proclitic. That phenomenon is obligatory in Neoštokavian idiom and therefore in all three standard languages, but it is often lost in spoken dialects because of the influence of other dialects (such as in Zagreb because of the influence of Kajkavian dialect).

====Slovenian====
In Slovenian, there are two concurrent standard accentual systems: the older, tonal, with three &quot;pitch accents&quot;, and the younger, dynamic (i.e., stress-based), with louder and longer syllables. The stress-based system was introduced because two thirds of Slovenia has lost its tonal accent. In practice, however, even the stress-based accentual system is just an abstract ideal, and speakers generally retain their own dialect even when they try to speak Standard Slovenian. For example, speakers of urban dialects in the west of Slovenia without distinctive length fail to introduce a quantitative opposition when they speak the standard language.

The older accentual system is tonal and free (&quot;jágoda&quot; &#x27;strawberry&#x27;, &quot;malína&quot; &#x27;raspberry&#x27;, &quot;gospodár&quot; &#x27;master, lord&#x27;). There are three kinds of accents: short falling (è), long falling (ȇ) and long rising (é). Non-final syllables always have long accents: &quot;rakîta&quot; &#x27;crustacea&#x27;, &quot;tetíva&quot; &#x27;sinew&#x27;. The short falling accent is always in the final syllable: &quot;bràt&quot; &#x27;brother&#x27;. Three-way opposition among accents can only then be present: &quot;deskà&quot; &#x27;board&#x27; : &quot;blagọ̑&quot;  &#x27;goods, ware&#x27; : &quot;gospá&quot; &#x27;lady&#x27;. Accent can be mobile throughout the inflectional paradigm: &quot;dȃr&quot; — &quot;darȗ&quot;, &quot;góra — gorẹ́&quot; — &quot;goràm&quot;, &quot;bràt — bráta&quot; — &quot;o brȃtu&quot;, &quot;kráva — krȃv&quot;, &quot;vóda — vodọ̑&quot; — &quot;na vọ̑do&quot;). The distinction is made between open &quot;-e-&quot; and &quot;-o-&quot; (either long or short) and closed &quot;-ẹ-&quot; and &quot;-ọ-&quot; (always long).

===Basque===
The Basque language of northeastern Spain and southwestern France has a number of different dialects and a number of accentual patterns. Only western varieties seem to have a tonal accent, and eastern varieties have a stress accent (the stress-accent dialects also differ one from another). According to an analysis first suggested by J.R. Hualde, Northern Bizkaian has most nouns accentless in their absolutive singular form, but they have a default high tone (shown by underlining below), which continues throughout the word except for the first syllable. These examples come from the Gernika (Guernica) dialect:
*&quot;Gerníké&quot; &quot;Guernica&quot;
*&quot;basóá&quot; &quot;forest&quot;
*&quot;patátíé&quot; &quot;potato&quot;
*&quot;guntsúrrúné&quot; &quot;kidney&quot;

There are, however, a few nouns (often borrowings) with a lexical accent. As in Japanese, the accent consists of a high tone, followed by a low one:
*&quot;Bílbo&quot; &quot;Bilbao&quot;
*&quot;apáriže&quot; &quot;supper&quot;

In addition, some suffixes (including all plural suffixes) are preaccenting and so cause an accent on the syllable before the suffix:
*&quot;ándrak&quot; &quot;women&quot;
*&quot;txakúrren&quot; &quot;of dogs&quot; (genitive plural)
*&quot;Gerníkétik&quot; &quot;from Guernica&quot;

Other suffixes do not cause any extra accent:
*&quot;txakúrrén&quot; &quot;of the dog&quot; (genitive singular)

When a preaccenting suffix is added to an already-accented word, only the first accent is retained:
*&quot;Bílbotik&quot; &quot;from Bilbao&quot;

The accent from Ondarroa is similar but the accent of the word, if any, always appears on the penultimate syllable:
*&quot;Bilbótik&quot; &quot;from Bilbao&quot; (Ondarroa pronunciation)

Intonation studies show that when an accentless word is spoken either in isolation or before a verb, it acquires an accent on its last syllable (or, in Ondarroa, on its penultimate syllable). However, that is an intonational accent, rather than a lexical accent:
*&quot;lagúná etorri da&quot; &quot;the friend (&quot;laguna&quot;) has come&quot;

When an accentless word in those dialects of Basque is followed by an accented word, the automatic high tones continue in a plateau as far as the accent:
*&quot;lagúnén ámúma ikusi dot&quot; &quot;I have seen the friend&#x27;s grandmother (&quot;amúma&quot;)&quot;

That also applies if the accent is intonational. In the following sentence, all words are unaccented apart from the intonational accent before the verb:
*&quot;lagúnén álábíá etorri da&quot; &quot;the friend&#x27;s daughter has come&quot;

When an accented word is focused, the pitch of the accented syllable is raised, but if the word is accentless, there is no rise in pitch on that word but only on the accented word. In the following phrase, only the word &quot;amúma&quot; &quot;grandmother&quot; is thus accented, whether the focus is on &quot;John&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, or &quot;grandmother&quot;, or none of these:
*&quot;Jonén lágúnén ámúma&quot; &quot;John&#x27;s friend&#x27;s grandmother&quot;

Another pitch accent area in Basque is found in western Navarre, near the border with France in the towns of Goizueta and Leitza. There is a strong stress accent there on the second or the first syllable of every word, like with central dialects of Basque, but there is also a pitch contrast superimposed on the stress: &quot;mendik&quot; (rise-dip-rise) &quot;the mountain&quot; vs. &quot;mendik&quot; (rise-fall) &quot;the mountains&quot;.

===Turkish===

Although the Turkish accent is traditionally referred to as &quot;stress&quot;, recent studies have pointed out that the main correlate of lexical accent is actually pitch. In a word like &quot;sözcükle&quot; &quot;with a word&quot;, the accented second syllable is thus higher than the other two but has less intensity (loudness).

Turkish word-accent is found especially in geographical names (&quot;İstanbul&quot;, Ankara&quot;, &quot;Yunanistan&quot; &quot;Greece&quot;, &quot;Adana&quot;), foreign borrowings (&quot;salata&quot; &quot;salad&quot;, &quot;lokanta&quot; &quot;restaurant&quot;), some proper names (Erdoğan&quot;, &quot;Kenedi&quot;), compound words (&quot;başkent&quot; &quot;capital city&quot;), some words referring to relatives (&quot;anne&quot; &quot;mother&quot;), and certain adverbs (&quot;şimdi&quot; &quot;now&quot;, &quot;yalnız&quot; &quot;only&quot;). It is also caused by certain suffixes, some of which are &quot;pre-accenting&quot; and so cause an accent on the syllable preceding them, such as negative &quot;-me-/-ma-&quot;, question particle &quot;mi?&quot;, or copula &quot;-dir&quot; &quot;it is&quot; (&quot;gelmedi&quot; &quot;he did not come&quot;, &quot;geldi mi?&quot; &quot;did he come?&quot;, &quot;güzeldir&quot; &quot;it is beautiful&quot;). The accented syllable is slightly higher in pitch than the following syllable. All other words, when pronounced in isolation, either have a slightly raised pitch on the final syllable or are pronounced with all the syllables level.

Turkish also has a phrase-accent and focus-accent. An accent on the first word of a phrase usually causes an accent in the following words or suffixes to be neutralised, e.g., &quot;çoban salatası&quot; &quot;shepherd salad&quot;, &quot;Ankara&#x27;dan da&quot; &quot;also from Ankara&quot;, &quot;telefon ettiler&quot; &quot;they telephoned&quot;, with only one accent.

A controversy exists over whether Turkish has accentless words, like Japanese and Basque. Some scholars, such as Levi (2005) and Özçelik (2016), see the final raised pitch sometimes heard in words such as &quot;arkadaş&quot; (&quot;friend&quot;) or &quot;geldi&quot; (&quot;he came&quot;) as a mere phrasal tone or boundary tone. Others, such as Kabak (2016), prefer the traditional view that the final accent in such words is a kind of stress.

===Persian===

The accent of Persian words used to be always referred to as &quot;stress&quot; but is recognised as a pitch accent in recent works. Acoustic studies show that accented syllables have some of the characteristics of stressed syllables in stress-accent languages (slightly more intensity, more length, more open vowels), but that effect is much less than would normally be expected in stress-accent languages. The main difference is one of pitch, with a contour of (L)+H*.

Normally, the pitch falls again at the end of the syllable (if final) or on the next syllable.

Persian nouns and adjectives are always accented on the final syllable. Certain suffixes, such as the plural &quot;-ha&quot;, shift the accent to themselves:
*&quot;ketâb&quot; &quot;book&quot;
*&quot;ketâb-hâ&quot; &quot;books&quot;
*&quot;ketâb-i&quot; &quot;bookish&quot;

Other suffixes, such as possessives and the indefinite &quot;-i&quot;, are clitic and so are unaccented:
*&quot;ketâb-etun&quot; &quot;your book&quot;
*&quot;ketâb-i&quot; &quot;a book&quot;

In verbs, the personal endings in the past tense are clitic but are accented in the future tense:
*&quot;gereft-am&quot; &quot;I took&quot;
*&quot;gerefte-am&quot; &quot;I have taken&quot;
*&quot;xâham gereft&quot; &quot;I will take&quot;

When prefixes are added, the accent shifts to the first syllable:
*&quot;mi-gir-am&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m taking&quot;
*&quot;na-gereft-am&quot; &quot;I did not take&quot;
*&quot;be-gir-am&quot; &quot;I should take&quot;

In the vocative (&quot;xânom!&quot; &quot;madam&quot;) and sometimes elsewhere, such as &quot;bale!&quot; &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;agar&quot; &quot;if&quot;, the accent is also on the first syllable.

In compound verbs, the accent is on the first element:
*&quot;kâr kard-am&quot; &quot;I worked&quot;

However, in compound nouns, the accent is on the second element:
*&quot;ketâb-xâne&quot; &quot;bookcase&quot;

In the &quot;ezâfe&quot; construction, the first noun is optionally accented but generally loses its pitch:
*&quot;mardom-e Irân&quot; / &quot;mardom-e Irân&quot; &quot;the people of Iran&quot;

When a word is focussed, the pitch is raised, and the words that follow usually lose their accent:
*&quot;nâme-ye mâmân-am bud ru miz&quot; &quot;it was my mom&#x27;s letter that was on the table&quot;

However, other researchers claim that the pitch of post-focus words is reduced but sometimes still audible.

===Japanese===
Standard Japanese and certain other varieties of Japanese are described as having a pitch accent, which differs significantly among dialects. In Standard Japanese, the &quot;accent&quot; may be characterized as a downstep rather than as pitch accent. The pitch of a word rises until it reaches a downstep and then drops abruptly. In a two-syllable word, a contrast thus occurs between &quot;high–low&quot; and &quot;low–high&quot;. Accentless words are also &quot;low–high&quot;, but the pitch of following enclitics differentiates them.

The Ōsaka accent (Kansai dialect) (marked red on the map to the right) differs from the Tokyo accent in that in some words, the first syllable of the word (always &quot;low&quot; in Tokyo Japanese unless accented) can be &quot;high&quot;. To give a full description of the accent of a word, therefore, it is necessary to specify not only the position of the accent (downstep) but also the height of the first syllable.

===Korean===
Standard (Seoul) Korean uses pitch only for prosody. However, several other dialects retain a Middle Korean pitch-accent system.

In the dialect of North Gyeongsang, in southeastern South Korea, any syllable and the initial two syllables may have a pitch accent in the form of a high tone. For example, in trisyllabic words, there are four possible tone patterns:
===Shanghainese===
The Shanghai dialect of Wu Chinese is marginally tonal, with characteristics of a pitch accent.

Not counting closed syllables (those with a final glottal stop), a monosyllabic Shanghainese may carry one of three tones: &quot;high&quot;, &quot;mid&quot;, &quot;low&quot;. The tones have a contour in isolation, but for the following purposes, it can be ignored. However, &quot;low&quot; tone always occurs after voiced consonants and only then. Thus, the only tonal distinction is after voiceless consonants and in vowel-initial syllables, and there is only a two-way distinction between &quot;high&quot; tone and &quot;mid&quot; tone.

In a polysyllabic word, the tone of the first syllable determines the tone of the entire word. If the first tone is &quot;high&quot;, the following syllables are mid. If it is either &quot;mid&quot; or &quot;low&quot; and not closed&quot;,&quot; the second syllable is &quot;high&quot;, and any following syllables are &quot;mid&quot;. If it is &quot;low&quot; and closed, the following syllables are mid. Thus, a mark for the high tone is all that is needed to note the tone in Shanghainese:

===Bantu languages===
The Bantu languages are a large group of some 550 languages, spread over most of south and central Africa. Proto-Bantu is believed to have had two tones: H and L. However, it does not appear to have had a pitch-accent system, as defined above, since words with such forms as HL, HH, LH, and LL were all found: *&quot;káda&quot; &quot;charcoal&quot;, *&quot;cómbá&quot; &quot;fish&quot;, *&quot;nyangá&quot; &quot;horn&quot; and *&quot;tope&quot; &quot;mud&quot;. In other words, some words like *&quot;cómbá&quot; could have two high tones, and others had one tone or none.

However, in the course of time, processes such as Meeussen&#x27;s Rule, by which sequences such as HHH became HLL, LHL, or LLH, tended to eliminate all but one tone in a word in many Bantu languages, making them more accent-like. Thus in Chichewa, the word for &quot;fish&quot; (&quot;nsómba&quot;) now has HL tones, exactly like the word for &quot;charcoal&quot; (&quot;khála&quot;).

Another process that makes for culminativity in some Bantu languages is the interaction between stress and tone. The penultimate syllable of a word is stressed in many Bantu languages, and some of them have a tendency for high tones to be on the penultimate. For example, in Chitumbuka, every phonological phrase is accented with a falling tone on the penultimate: &quot;ti-ku-phika sî:ma&quot; &quot;we are cooking porridge&quot;. In other languages, such as Xhosa, the high tone is attracted to the antepenultimate although the penultimate being stressed.

Ciluba and Ruund, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are two Bantu languages that are interesting for their &quot;tone reversal&quot;. Low tone is phonologically active in places that other languages of the same family have a high tone. Thus, in a word like *&quot;mukíla&quot; &quot;tail&quot;, most other Bantu languages have a high tone on the second syllable, but Chiluba has &quot;mukìla&quot; and Ruund has &quot;mukìl&quot;, with a low-toned accent.

====Luganda====

Luganda, a language of Uganda, has some words with apparent tonal accents. They can be either high or falling (rising tones do not occur in Luganda). Falling tones are found on bimoraic syllables or word-finally:
*&quot;ensî&quot; &quot;country&quot;
*&quot;ekibúga&quot; &quot;city&quot;
*&quot;eddwâliro&quot; &quot;hospital&quot;

Some words, however, have two accents, which are joined in a plateau:
*&quot;Kámpálâ&quot; &quot;Kampala&quot;

Other words are accentless:
*&quot;ekitabo&quot; &quot;book&quot;

However, accentless words are not always without tones but usually receive a default tone on all syllables except the first one or the first mora:
*&quot;ekítábó&quot; &quot;book&quot;
*&quot;Bunyóró&quot; &quot;Bunyoro&quot; (name of region)

A double consonant at the beginning of a word counts as a mora. In such words, the first syllable also can have a default tone:
*&quot;Ttóró&quot; &quot;Toro&quot; (a region)

Default tones are also heard on the end of accented words if there is a gap of at least one mora after the accent (the default tones are lower in pitch than the preceding accent):
*&quot;amasérengétá&quot; &quot;south&quot;
*&quot;eddwâlíró&quot; &quot;hospital&quot;

The default tones are not always heard but disappear in certain contexts, such as if a noun is the subject of a sentence or used before a numeral:
*&quot;Mbarara kibúga&quot; &quot;Mbarara is a city&quot;
*&quot;ebitabo kkúmi&quot; &quot;ten books&quot;

In some contexts such as affirmative verb + location, or phrases with &quot;of&quot;), the high tone of an accent (or of a default tone) can continue in a plateau all the way until the next accented syllable:
*&quot;mu maséréngétá gá Úgáńda&quot; &quot;in the south of Uganda&quot;
*&quot;alí mú Búgáńda&quot; &quot;he is in Buganda&quot;

The situation with verbs is more complicated, however, since some of the verbal roots have their own inherent word-accent, but also, the prefixes added to the verb also often have an accent. Also, some tenses (such as negative tenses and relative clause tenses) add an accent on the final syllable.

When two or three accents come in a row in a verb, H-H becomes H-L, and H-H-H becomes H-L-L. However, the default tones are not added on the syllables with deleted accents, which leads to forms like &quot;bálilabá&quot; (from &quot;*bá-lí-lába&quot;) &quot;they will see&quot;. There, not one but two low-toned syllables follow the accent.

Another rule is that if two accents in the same verb are not next to each other, they form a plateau. Thus, the negative tense &quot;tágulâ&quot; &quot;he does not buy&quot; is pronounced &#x27;tágúlâ&quot;&#x27;&quot;, with a plateau.

====Chichewa====

Chichewa, a language widely spoken in Malawi, is tonal but has accentual properties. Most Chichewa simple nouns have only one high tone, usually on one of the last three syllables. (See Chichewa tones.)
*&quot;chímanga&quot; &quot;maize&quot;
*&quot;chikóndi&quot; &quot;love&quot;
*&quot;chinangwá&quot; &quot;cassava&quot; (usually pronounced &quot;chinăngwā&quot;, with rising tone on the penultimate)

However, many number of nouns have no high tone but are accentless. Unlike the accentless words in Luganda, however, they do not acquire any default tones but are pronounced with all the syllables low:
*&quot;chipatala&quot; &quot;hospital&quot;

A few nouns (often but not always compounds) have two high tones. If they are separated by only one syllable, they usually join in a plateau:
*&quot;chizólówezí&quot; &quot;habit&quot;
*&quot;bírímánkhwe&quot; &quot;chameleon&quot;

Most verbal roots in Chichewa are accentless. However, a few verbs also have lexical accents, but they are not inherited from Proto-Bantu. When there is an accent, it is always heard on the final &quot;-a&quot; of the verb:
*&quot;thokozá-ni&quot; &quot;give thanks (pl.)&quot;

Some accents are added by prefixes and suffixes. For example, the infinitive prefix &quot;ku-&quot; is postaccenting, adding a tone on the following syllable, while the suffix &quot;-nso&quot; &quot;again/also&quot; is preaccenting:
*&quot;fotokoza&quot; &quot;explain&quot; (toneless)
*&quot;kufótokoza&quot; &quot;to explain&quot;
*&quot;kufótokozánso&quot; &quot;to explain again&quot;

The verbal system is complicated by the fact that overlying the tones of the verb and suffixes is a series of tonal patterns that changes by tense. There are at least eight patterns for affirmative tenses and other different patterns for relative clause verbs and negative verbs.

For example, the present habitual tense has tones on the first and penultimate syllables, the recent past has a tone after the tense-marker -&quot;na&quot;-, the subjunctive has a tone on the final syllable and the potential is toneless. The tones apply, with minor variations, to all verbs, whether the stem is long or short:
*&quot;ndímafotokóza&quot; &quot;I (usually) explain&quot;
*&quot;ndinafótokoza&quot; &quot;I explained (just now)&quot;
*&quot;ndifotokozé&quot; &quot;I should explain&quot;
*&quot;ndingafotokoze&quot; &quot;I could explain&quot;

When a verb has a penultimate accent, most other tones tend to be suppressed. For example, in the negative future, both the tone of the future-tense marker, &quot;-dzá-&quot;, and the tone of the negative marker, &quot;sí-&quot; (both normally high), are neutralised:
*&quot;sindidzafotokóza&quot; &quot;I will not explain&quot;

Those and other processes cause most verb tenses to have only one or two high tones, which are at the beginning, the penultimate or the final of the verb stem or at a prefix or sometimes even both. That gives the impression that the tones in the resultant words have a clearly-accentual quality.

===English===
Most dialects of English are classified as stress-accent languages. However, there are some dialects in which tone can play a part in the word accent.

====Hong Kong English====
Lexical words in Hong Kong English are assigned at least one H (high) tone. Disyllabic words may have the tone pattern H-o (clóckwise), H-H (sómetímes), o-H (creáte), where &quot;o&quot; stands for tonelessness. Trisyllabic words receive any one of seven possible tone assignments H-H-H (kángároo), H-H-o (hándwríting), H-o-H (róundabóut), H-o-o (thréátening), o-H-H (abóut-túrn), o-H-o (esséntial), o-o-H (recomménd). Toneless syllables receive other pitch assignments depending on their positions: word-initial toneless syllables are M(id)-toned, utterance-final toneless syllables are Low, and word-medial toneless syllables vary across two major sub-dialects in the community surfacing as either H or M. Because lexical stipulation of Hong Kong English tones are {H, o} privative, one is easily misled into thinking of Hong Kong English as a pitch-accented language. It is, however, probably more accurate to think of Hong Kong English as a language with lexical tones.

====South African English====
In Broad South African English, (phonetically ) is often deleted, such as in word-initial stressed syllables (as in &quot;house&quot;), but at least as often, it is pronounced even if it seems to be deleted. The vowel that follows in the word-initial syllable often carries a low or low rising tone. In rapid speech, that can be the only trace of the deleted . Potentially minimal tonal pairs are thus created, like &quot;oh&quot; (neutral or high falling ) vs. &quot;hoe&quot; (low or low rising ).

====Welsh English====
A distinctive feature of Welsh English is the rising pitch on the last syllable of major words, imitating the rising pitch of word-final syllables in Welsh (see below). An important factor in the realisation of stress in both Welsh and Welsh English is the length of the post-stress consonant, which tends to be longer than the stressed vowel itself.

=== Welsh ===
In Welsh a stress accent usually comes on the penultimate syllable (with a few exceptions accented on the final, such as the word &quot;Cymraeg&quot; &quot;Welsh&quot;), and is usually on a low pitch followed by a rising pitch. &quot;In Welsh, the stressed syllable is associated with lower pitch than less stressed or unstressed syllables ... However, the post-stress syllable in Welsh is typically produced on a higher pitch.&quot; It is believed that this came about because late Brythonic (the ancestor of Welsh) had a penultimate accent that was pronounced with a high pitch. When the final vowels of words were lost, the high pitch remained on what was now the final syllable, but the stress moved to the new penultimate. Thus LHL changed to LH, with the stress on the low syllable.

Although it is usually said that the high pitch is in the final syllable of the word, an acoustic study of Anglesey Welsh found that in that dialect at least the peak of the tone was actually in the penultimate syllable, thus the last two syllables were L+H* L.

===Yaqui===
The Yaqui are a native American people living mostly in Mexico but also in Arizona. About 17,000 people are said to speak Yaqui, which is a Uto-Aztecan language.

Yaqui has a tonal accent in which the accent is on the first or the second mora of the word. A long vowel has two moras in Yaqui, and a short vowel or diphthong has one mora. After the accent, the high tone continues with a very slight decline until the end of the word.

About two thirds of words have an accent on the first mora, and all tones of the word are then high:
*&quot;kárí&quot; &quot;house&quot;
*&quot;hamút&quot; &quot;woman&quot;
*&quot;tééká&quot; &quot;sky&quot; (where &quot;ee&quot; represents a long vowel)
*&quot;teéká&quot; &quot;lay down&quot;

In some words with a long first vowel, the accent moves to the second syllable, and the vowel of the first syllable then becomes short:
*&quot;bákót&quot; &quot;snake&quot;
*&quot;bakóttá&quot; &quot;snake (object of verb)&quot;

In a certain kind of reduplication, the accent moves to the first mora, and the next consonant is then usually doubled. At the same time, since a long vowel cannot follow the accent, the vowel after the accent is also shortened:
*&quot;teéká&quot; &quot;lay down&quot;
*&quot;téttéká&quot; &quot;in the process of laying something down&quot;

At the end of a phrase, the pitch drops, with a low boundary tone.

To an English-speaker, the first high tone in Yaqui &quot;sounds very much like a stress&quot;. However, acoustic studies show that the amplitude of the accented syllable is not really greater than the other syllables in the word are.

<text>Ni Putes Ni Soumises (which roughly translates as &quot;Neither Whores nor Submissives&quot;) is a French feminist movement, founded in 2002, which has secured the recognition of the French press and the National Assembly of France. It is generally dependent on public funding. It is also the name of a book written by Fadela Amara, one of the leaders of the movement, with the help of &quot;Le Monde&quot; journalist Sylvia Zappi.

In 2005 this movement inspired the creation of the similarly named movement in Sweden.

Fadela Amara was appointed as junior minister for urban policy in François Fillon&#x27;s first government in May 2007. She left the government in 2010, and was named France&#x27;s inspector general for social affairs in January 2011.

NPNS was set up by a group of young French women, including Samira Bellil, in response to the violence being directed at them in the predominantly Muslim immigrant suburbs (&quot;banlieues&quot;) and public housing (&quot;cités&quot;) of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, where organised gang-rapes are referred to as &quot;tournantes&quot;, or &quot;pass-arounds&quot;.

==Goals ==
Ni Putes Ni Soumises fights against violence targeting women, including domestic violence and gang rape, as well as social pressures.

The movement&#x27;s platform for victims of domestic violence helps women and their children escape dangerous situations and supports them in the rebuilding of their lives after the fact. Its support team is made up of lawyers, psychologists, an educational specialist and a legal counsel.

Ni Putes Ni Soumises also supports the White Ribbon Campaign, which runs from 25 November to 6 December every year, and uses this as an opportunity to promote 3919, the national domestic violence helpline.

Ni Putes Ni Soumises also carries out awareness-raising seminars in schools in order to encourage students to think about gender equality and break the cycle of sexism. In this way, the movement was able to reach out to 950 students in 2016.

The slogan used by the movement is meant both to shock and mobilise. Members particularly protest against changes of attitudes toward women, claiming there is an increased influence of Islamic extremism in those French suburbs with large immigrant populations. A particular concern is the treatment of Muslim women. Members claim that they may be pressured into wearing veils, leaving school, and marrying early. However, the movement represents women of all faiths and ethnic origins, all of whom may find themselves trapped by poverty and the ghettoisation of the &quot;cités&quot;.

A translation of the key points of NPNS&#x27;s national appeal on its official website:
*No more moralising: our condition has worsened. The media and politics have done nothing, or very little, for us.
*No more wretchedness. We are fed up with people speaking for us, with being treated with contempt.
*No more justifications of our oppression in the name of the right to be different and of respect toward those who force us to bow our heads.
*No more silence in public debates about violence, poverty and discrimination.

==Early history==

=== Samira Bellil and Sohanne Benziane ===
Two high-profile cases gave a particular impetus to NPNS during 2003. The first was that of Samira Bellil, who published a book called &quot;Dans l&#x27;enfer des tournantes&quot; (&quot;In Gang Rape Hell&quot;). In the culture of the banlieues, organised gang-rapes are referred to as &quot;tournantes&quot;, or &quot;pass-arounds&quot;.

In her book, Bellil recounts her life as a girl under &quot;la loi des cités&quot; (the law of the ghetto) where she was gang raped on more than one occasion, the first time at age 13, afraid to speak out, and ultimately seen only as a sexual object, alienated and shunned by her family and some of her friends.

The second case was that of 17-year-old Sohanne Benziane, who was burned alive by an alleged small-time gang leader.

=== Protest marches ===
In the wake of these events, members of &quot;Ni Putes Ni Soumises&quot; staged a march through France, which started in February 2003 and passed through over 20 cities before culminating in a 30,000-strong demonstration in Paris on 8 March 2003. The march was officially called &quot;la Marche des femmes des quartiers contre les ghettos et pour l&#x27;égalité&quot; (The March of Women from the public housing against ghettoes and for equality).

Representatives of Ni Putes Ni Soumises were received by French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin. Their message was also incorporated into the official celebrations of Bastille Day 2003 in Paris, when 14 giant posters each of a modern woman dressed as Marianne, the symbol of the French Republic, were hung on the columns of the Palais Bourbon, the home of the Assemblée nationale (the lower house of the French parliament).

The following five propositions were accepted by the French government:
#The publication of an educational guide dealing with respect, to be distributed in the housing projects and schools.
#The establishment of safe houses away from the housing projects for girls and women in immediate distress, where they can be safe in relative anonymity.
#The creation of six pilot sites where women will be able to have their voices heard.
#The organisation of training seminars for women to develop their particular strengths.
#Special provisions made in police stations for girls and women who have been the victims of violence.

=== Maison de la Mixité ===
The inauguration of the Maison de la Mixitié, the movement&#x27;s premises in Paris&#x27; 20th arrondissement, took place in 2006. Then-President Jacques Chirac and then-future-President François Hollande both attended the event.

== Recent history ==
In November 2016 Ni Putes Ni Soumises elected a new leadership team, with Stéphanie Rameau, a long-serving member and activist in the movement, voted president.

In May 2017 Ni Putes Ni Soumises moved into its new premises at 80 rue de Paris in Montreuil, a largely working-class suburb of Paris.

== Criticisms ==

&quot;Ni Putes Ni Soumises&quot; has been criticized by various French feminists and left-wing authors (Sylvie Tissot, Elsa Dorlin, Étienne Balibar, Houria Bouteldja, etc.), who claimed that it overshadowed the work of other feminist NGOs and that it supported an Islamophobic instrumentalization of feminism by the French Right.

Houria Bouteldja qualified &quot;Ni Putes ni Soumises&quot; as an Ideological State Apparatus (AIE). The debate among the French Left concerning the 2004 law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools, mainly targeted against the &quot;Hijab&quot;, is to be seen under this light. They underline that, first, sexism is not specific to immigrant populations, French culture itself not being devoid of sexism, and second, that the focus on mediatic and violent acts passes under silence the precarization of women.

Sylvie Tissot writes that Amara collaborated with the &quot;Cercle de l&#x27;Oratoire&quot;, and Mohammed Abdi, the current president of the NGO, is a member of this think-tank.

<text>DKNY is a New York City–based American fashion house for men and women, founded in 1984 by Donna Karan. The company specializes in a wide range of fashion products, including clothing, footwear, accessories and fragrances. 

==History==
Karan worked for 15 years at Anne Klein, including 10 as its head designer. In 1984 Karan and her late husband Stephan Weiss were offered the opportunity to start their own business by the owner of Anne Klein, Takihyo LLC.

The company became a publicly traded in 1996.

In 2001, it was purchased by the French conglomerate corporation LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy). In 2015, Donna Karan left as chief designer at Donna Karan International, to focus on her Urban Zen brand and Urban Zen Foundation philanthropy. LVMH sold Donna Karan International, with the &#x27;Donna Karan&#x27; and &#x27;DKNY&#x27; brands, to the G-III Apparel Group in 2016 for $650 million. G-III, based in New York City, is a manufacturer and distributor of clothing and accessories under their owned brands, licensed brands, and private label brands.

==Donna Karan New York==
Donna Karan&#x27;s mainline label &quot;Donna Karan New York&quot;, also referred as &quot;Donna Karan Collection&quot;, debuted for fall 1985 with the women&#x27;s collection &quot;Seven Easy Pieces&quot;, &quot;where a handful of interchangeable items work together to create an entire wardrobe that goes from day to evening, week day to weekend, season to season&quot;. In July 1991, she launched her first menswear collection.

The &quot;New York&quot; part on the label is there to set &quot;the pace, the attitude&quot; of the fashion house&#x27;s offering.

==DKNY and other divisions==
Inspired by her daughter Gaby, Donna Karan founded DKNY in 1989 as a younger, more affordable diffusion line to run alongside her existing Donna Karan New York label. Many labels and brands have branched off of the original DKNY brand/label including DKNY Jeans, DKNY Active, DKNY Underwear, DKNY Juniors, DKNY Kids, DKNY Pure. DKNY Men, launched in 1992, consists of tailored suits, dress wear, formalwear, casual wear, sportswear, and shoes.

The Donna Karan Beauty collection, which specializes in fragrances, was launched in 1992. In 2001, the Donna Karan Home collection, which includes traditional luxury bedding and accessories, and DKNY Home, which has more contemporary and fashion-forward bedding, were introduced.

For its advertisement campaigns, DKNY has been working with several high-profile photographers, including Collier Schorr (2017). Cara Delevingne was the face of DKNY for multiple seasons in the mid 2010s. Subsequent DKNY campaigns have featured Emily Ratajkowski (2017) and Kaia Gerber (2024).

==Stores==
Stores opened in London in 1997 and New York City in 1999. The DKNY headquarters is located at 550 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York. There are currently seventy Donna Karan collection and DKNY stores globally, including twenty stores in China including Hong Kong and Shanghai, two stores in Canada including Vancouver, B.C. and Montreal, four in Dubai and also two stores in Doha. The fashion house also has stores in Denmark. 

Since 2005, Donna Karan has offered online shopping of its DKNY and associated lines at the label&#x27;s web site. Products range from DKNY and DKNY Jeans womenswear, accessories, underwear, shoes, baby clothing, the PURE collection to DKNY menswear. The latter was available up until the spring 2002 season. Since then, only the DKNY Jeans label, underwear, eyewear and watches have been offered online for men.

==Controversy==
In 2013, DKNY became embroiled in controversy over street photography it admitted it used in one of its stores, without permission, from the New York City street photographer Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York (HONY). After Stanton learned of the use of his photography, he publicly asked DKNY to donate $100,000 to the YMCA to help with summer programs. Amidst strong criticism on social media sites, DKNY apologized and donated $25,000 to the YMCA. Stanton then asked his followers on the HONY Facebook page to make up the difference to reach his initial goal of $100,000, which was reached on March 1, 2013.

In July 2016, French luxury giant LVMH, which has owned Karan&#x27;s company since 2001, even though she stayed on to run the brands—shelved her flagship line Donna Karan International shortly after she left in June 2015 and said it would &quot;substantially increase its focus&quot; on her DKNY brand, which revolutionized women&#x27;s fashion in the &#x27;80s with Karan&#x27;s &quot;Seven Easy Pieces&quot; concept of a wardrobe made up of a handful of interchangeable items. Today, she is looking to sell off its Donna Karan business, less than a year after the fashion designer stepped down from her namesake brand. LVMH is targeting a &quot;single, specific American buyer&quot; for both the DKNY and Donna Karan International businesses after several &quot;months of disappointing performance&quot; under its new designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osbourne.

Since then, LVMH has successfully sold DKNY to the G-III Apparel Group in 2016 for $650 million.

<doc id="434256" wikidata="Q841898" url="?curid=434256" title="USS Dayton (CL-105)">
<text>USS &quot;Dayton&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship was launched 19 March 1944 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. H. Rueger, and commissioned 7 January 1945, Captain Paul William Steinhagen in command. Construction for &quot;Dayton&quot; was underwritten in part by the citizens of the City of Dayton Ohio through the purchase of war bonds.

==Design==


The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Dayton&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Dayton&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Dayton&quot; was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, on 8 March 1943. She was launched on 19 March 1944 and was commissioned for active service on 7 January 1945 with the hull number CL-105. After completing her shakedown cruise, she traveled to the Pacific Ocean, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 15 May. There, she took part in combat training, before getting underway to join the 3rd Fleet for offensive operations against Japanese forces. She reached San Pedro Bay, Leyte, in the Philippines on 16 June. There, she joined Task Force 38, and she was assigned to the subordinate unit Task Group 38.1, along with five aircraft carriers, three fast battleships, four other cruisers, and several destroyers.

Two weeks later, on 1 July, the fleet sortied to carry out a series of air strikes on Japanese targets in the Home Islands. &quot;Dayton&quot; formed part of the anti-aircraft screen that protected the aircraft carriers during these operations. The attacks began on 7 July and were carried out intermittently over the following eleven days. During this period, on 18 July, &quot;Dayton&quot; was temporarily transferred to Task Group 35.4, along with the cruisers , , and and eight destroyers. The unit carried out a sweep for Japanese coastal shipping that night, but failed to locate any significant targets. &quot;Dayton&quot; thereafter returned to TG 38.1 and remained with it for the next month during the initial occupation operations. The ships entered Sagami Bay on 27 August with the rest of TF 38 to begin preparations for the formal surrender of Japan, which took place aboard the battleship on 2 September. &quot;Dayton&quot; entered Tokyo Bay on 10 September as part of the occupation force. She remained there through 7 November, apart from a brief voyage to Eniwetok for periodic maintenance. &quot;Dayton&quot; left Japan on 7 November and reached San Pedro, California, twelve days later. The ship received one battle star during her short wartime career.

On 24 January 1946, &quot;Dayton&quot; departed San Pedro for Pearl Harbor, arriving there on the 30th. From there, she got underway bound for Japan, but while still en route on 7 February, she received a change in orders transferring her to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. She took part in training exercises held off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, later that year before sailing for her new home port at Norfolk, Virginia. The ship embarked on a tour of the Mediterranean Sea on 3 February 1947. During the cruise, she participated in maneuvers off Malta, visited a series of foreign ports including Istanbul, Turkey, and acted as the flagship of Commander of Naval Forces, Mediterranean. She arrived back in the United States on 30 November, stopping first at Boston. She thereafter took part in training operations held off the coast of New England, operating out of Newport, Rhode Island into 1948. Another voyage to the Mediterranean followed from 9 February to 26 June. &quot;Dayton&quot; was then decommissioned on 1 March 1949 at Boston. After more than a decade in the reserve fleet, the ship was stricken from the naval register on 1 September 1961 and sold to ship breakers on 6 April 1962.

<text>Port Augusta (&quot;Goordnada&quot; in the revived indigenous Barngarla language) is a coastal city in South Australia about by road from the state capital, Adelaide. Most of the city is on the eastern shores of Spencer Gulf, immediately south of the gulf&#x27;s head, comprising the city&#x27;s centre and surrounding suburbs, Stirling North, and seaside homes at Commissariat Point, Blanche Harbor and Miranda. The suburb of Port Augusta West is on the western side of the gulf on the Eyre Peninsula. Together, these localities had a population of 13,515 people in the .

Formerly a seaport, the city supports regional agriculture and services many mines in the South Australian interior to its north. A significant industry was electricity generation until 2019, when its coal-burning power stations were shut down. A solar farm opened in 2020.

==History==
Port Augusta is part of Aboriginal Australians&#x27; Nukunu country, in which the local language is Barngarla. The last speaker of the language died in 1964, but successful efforts have been made to revive it based on a 3500-word dictionary compiled in the 1840s by German Lutheran pastor Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann. Its original Barngarla name is &quot;Goordnada&quot;.

It is a natural harbour, which was proclaimed on 24 May 1852 by Alexander Elder (brother of Thomas Elder) and John Grainger, having discovered it while aboard the Government schooner &quot;Yatala&quot;, captained by Edward Dowsett. The port was named after Augusta Sophia, Lady Young, the wife of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry Edward Fox Young. Lady Young was the daughter of Charles Marryat Snr., who had been a slaveholder in the British West Indies. Her brother was the Anglican minister Dean of Adelaide Charles Marryat.

== Flora and fauna ==
Marine species include resident species and migrating visitors. Occasional sightings are made of whales, sunfish, swordfish and turtles.

==Demographics==
The city and its surrounds had a population of 13,515 people in the . It was therefore the fourth largest urban area outside of Adelaide after Mount Gambier, Whyalla and Port Lincoln. 83.4% of residents were born in Australia and 20.8% were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The most prevalent employment was community and personal service workers (17.7%), professionals (14.9%), technicians and trades workers (14.0%), labourers (13.1%), clerical and administrative workers (11.1%), sales workers (9.3%), machinery operators and drivers (9.3%), and managers (8.3%). The unemployment rate was 6.5% (South Australia: 5.4%). The median weekly household income was A$1277 per week.

==Transport==
Port Augusta is at the head of Spencer Gulf, a natural barrier to land transport, leading to the city being considered to be the &quot;crossroads of Australia&quot;, the junction of major road and rail links.

===Road===
Port Augusta is located at the eastern end of the Eyre Highway to Perth and at the northern end of the Augusta Highway to Adelaide. It is situated at the southern end of the Stuart Highway to Darwin. Virtually all road traffic across southern Australia passes through Port Augusta across the top of Spencer Gulf.

Twice-daily coach services operate between Port Augusta, other country centres and Adelaide.

===Rail===

In 1878, the town became the southern terminus of a proposed north–south transcontinental line headed for Darwin away. As part of its commitments undertaken at Federation, the federal government took over this narrow-gauge railway in 1911 and named it the &quot;Central Australia Railway&quot; in 1926. In 1929, it was extended to its last terminus at Alice Springs.

Between 1913 and 1917, a long, east–west transcontinental railway, the Trans-Australian Railway, was built from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. It was built to standard gauge as part of a long-term plan to harmonise gauges between the mainland states. The choice created a break of gauge at Port Augusta until the standard gauge track was extended to Port Pirie in 1937. The last component of the all-through standard gauge line from Adelaide to Darwin was only completed in 2003.

Port Augusta is a stopping place of two long-distance &quot;experiential&quot; train services: the east-west &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; transcontinental service and &quot;The Ghan&quot; service between Adelaide and Darwin.

The not-for-profit Pichi Richi Railway, established in the 1970s on the southernmost section of the Central Australia Railway (CAR) at Quorn, was not connected to Port Augusta after the CAR closed in 1980. An ambitious project to build a line from Stirling North to the centre of Port Augusta was completed in 2001 and now provides half-day and full-day heritage railway journeys on selected dates from March to November.

===Aviation===
Port Augusta Airport, from the city, handles about 16,000 &quot;fly-in fly-out&quot; passengers a year who work at many mines in the north of South Australia. , no other flights were available at the airport.

==Climate==
Port Augusta has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh), with hot summers, mild winters and minimal precipitation year-round. Some authors define it as hot semi-arid climate (BSh). Temperatures vary throughout the year, with average maxima ranging from in January to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Mean annual rainfall is very low: , spread between 72.2 precipitation days. There are 142.1 clear days and 92.4 cloudy days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 3 August 2014 to on 24 January 2019. Port Augusta has desert vegetation, although the city maintains with governmental aid with some plants adapted to aridity. Port Augusta is regarded as a desert environment by the local government.

==Economy==
===Electricity generation===
From the mid-1920s, the town was supplied with direct current electricity, which changed to alternating current in 1948.

Electricity was generated at the Playford B (240 MW) and Northern power stations (520 MW) from brown coal mined at Leigh Creek, 250 km to the north. The only coal-fired electricity generating plants in South Australia, in 2009 they produced 33% of the state&#x27;s electricity, but over 50% of the state&#x27;s CO2 emissions from electricity generation.

Playford B has not been operational since 2012. In October 2015, Alinta Energy announced the permanent closure of both Northern and Playford B in early 2016. The Northern Power Station went offline in May 2016.

In 2016, a local community group was lobbying for assistance to replace the coal-fired plants with a solar thermal power station. The premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill announced in August 2017 that construction would begin in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2020. The Aurora Solar Thermal Power Project is expected to cost to build, including a loan from the Federal Government, and deliver 150MW of electricity. SolarReserve has a contract to supply all of the electricity required by the state government&#x27;s offices from this power project.

=== Arid-zone horticulture ===
Separately, Sundrop Farms has a combined solar power tower, greenhouse and desalination plant which is used to produce tomatoes near the old power station site. It opened in October 2016 and produces 39MW of thermal energy from over 23,000 mirrors and a tower, used for heating, electricity, and desalination to irrigate tomatoes in greenhouses. Sundrop has a 10-year contract to supply Coles Supermarkets with at least 15,000 tonnes of truss tomatoes per year.

=== Tourism ===
Port Augusta has been able to capitalise on the growing eco-tourism industry due to its proximity to the Flinders Ranges. The Pichi Richi Railway is a major drawcard, connecting Port Augusta to Quorn via the Pichi Richi Pass.

Within Port Augusta is the City of Port Augusta&#x27;s Wadlata Outback Centre, providing tourists with an introduction to life in the Australian outback. The centre recorded over 500,000 visitors in 2006.
North of the town, on the Stuart Highway, is the Australian Arid Lands Botanic Garden, a unique and award-winning garden, opened in 1996, which &quot;showcases a diverse collection of arid zone habitats in a picturesque setting of more than 250 hectares&quot;. The gardens have a cafe/restaurant with views across the saltbush plains to the escarpment of the Flinders Ranges. The PACC annual report shows more than 100,000 people visited the gardens in 2006.

Southwest of town is the El-Alamein army base.

=== Proposed multi-commodity port ===
In February 2019, the site of the former Playford power stations was sold by Alinta Energy to Cu-River Mining as a prospective port development site. The company intended to construct a transshipment facility suitable for the export of iron ore, wheat and other commodities.

==Media==
The major publication of the town is &quot;The Transcontinental&quot;, a weekly newspaper that was first issued in October 1914 and continues to be located on Commercial Road. In 1971, a brief experiment, known as the &quot;Northern Observer&quot; (7 July 1971 – 30 August 1971), occurred when &quot;The Transcontinental&quot; and &quot;The Recorder&quot; from Port Pirie were published under a combined title in Port Pirie.

Historically, the town published the &quot;Dispatch&quot; (1877–1916), which, as was common at the time, evolved through a series of name changes: &quot;Port Augusta Dispatch&quot; (18 August 1877 – 6 August 1880); &quot;Port Augusta Dispatch and Flinders&#x27; Advertiser&quot; (13 August 1880 – 17 October 1884); &quot;Port Augusta Dispatch&quot; (20 October 1884 – 16 March 1885); and, &quot;Port Augusta Dispatch, Newcastle and Flinders Chronicle&quot; (18 March 1885 – 21 April 1916). For a short period, due to the short-lived discovery of gold at Teetulpa, a sister publication &quot;Teetulpa News and Golden Age&quot; (1886–1887) was printed by the &quot;Dispatch&quot;.

Another publication, the &quot;Port Augusta and Stirling Illustrated News&quot; (1901), was printed briefly in the town by James Taylor, but was curtailed so he could focus on his printing business.

==Politics==
===State and federal===

Since the 2020 redistribution, Port Augusta was split between the state electoral district of Stuart and electoral district of Giles. In federal politics, the city is part of the division of Grey, and has been represented by Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey since 2007. Grey is held with a margin of 8.86% and is considered safe-liberal. The results shown are from the largest polling station in Port Augusta – which is located at Port Augusta TAFE college.

===Local===
Port Augusta is in the City of Port Augusta local government area. The City of Port Augusta is believed to have had the longest serving mayor in Australia, Joy Baluch, who died after 30 years of service on 14 May 2013. The council is based at the Port Augusta Civic Centre; prior to 1983, it operated out of the now-disused Port Augusta Town Hall.

<doc id="434266" wikidata="Q319075" url="?curid=434266" title="Antipater the Idumaean">
<text>Antipater I the Idumaean (113 or 114 BCE – 43 BCE) was the founder of the Herodian dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas and had formerly held that name. A native of Idumaea (a region southeast of Judah in which the Edomites settled during the classical period) Antipater became a powerful official under the later Hasmonean kings and subsequently became a client of Roman General Pompey when Pompey conquered Judah in the name of the Roman Republic.

After Julius Caesar defeated Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus, Antipater sided with Caesar during the Roman Civil War. During Caesar&#x27;s Egyptian campaign, Antipater joined Mithridates of Pergamon&#x27;s army marching to rescue Caesar in Alexandria. Caesar made him chief minister of Judea, as Judah became known to the Romans, with the right to collect taxes. Eventually Caesar made Antipater&#x27;s sons Phasaelus and Herod the governors of Jerusalem and Galilee, respectively. After the assassination of Caesar, Antipater was forced to side with the Liberators against the Caesarians. The pro-Roman politics of Antipater led to his increasing unpopularity among the devout, non-Hellenised Jews. He died by poison. The diplomacy and artful politics of Antipater, as well as his insinuation into the Hasmonean court, paved the way for the rise of his son Herod the Great, who used this position to marry the Hasmonean princess Mariamne, endear himself to Rome and become king of Judea under Roman influence.

==Background==
Though historians understand that Antipater&#x27;s family had converted to Judaism in the second century BCE, different stories circulated in the wake of his sons coming to power. They demonstrate the tensions that existed between the Jewish people and the powerful Edomites who appear at this time. Nicolaus of Damascus, the court historian for Herod the Great, wrote that Herod&#x27;s ancestors were among the historical elite in Jerusalem who had been taken by King Nebuchadnezzar into Babylonian captivity in the sixth century BCE. This account serves two purposes; when the Persian King Cyrus sent the captives in Babylon back to Judea, it is likely that some chose to settle elsewhere. A legitimate dispersion such as this would shroud the fact that Herod&#x27;s ancestry is undocumented in the meticulous records of returned Jewish families. Claiming a heritage among the Jews from as early as the Babylonian captivity provides credibility for a pro-Roman and Hellenized Herod as a king over the Jews, for they were highly contemptuous of him. Josephus explains this rendering by critiquing its author: Nicolaus wrote to please Herod and would do so at the cost of truthfulness.

Instead Josephus explains that Antipater&#x27;s family converted to Judaism during the forced conversions by the Sadducee-influenced Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus. Hyrcanus threatened that any Idumaean who wished to maintain their land would need to be circumcised and enter into the traditions of the Jews. Josephus acknowledges Herod as being &quot;by birth a Jew&quot; and Antipater as being &quot;of the same people&quot; with the Jews. Nevertheless, this influential family came to be resented by many Jews for their Edomite ancestry, a fact used by the Hasmoneans and their supporters against them. As such, in a polemic against Herod to discredit him in the eyes of the Romans as unfit to become king of the Jews, Antigonus the Hasmonean is quoted by Josephus as referring to Herod as &quot;no more than a private man, and an Idumean, i.e. a half Jew&quot;.

Early Church Fathers often portray Herod polemically, and as such, their accounts of his familial origin reflected poetic license in place of historical accuracy. According to Sextus Julius Africanus, Antipater&#x27;s father was named Herod, not Antipas, Epiphanius of Salamis furthered this claim by writing Antipas was the name of this Herod&#x27;s father. Neither of these genealogies are accepted by scholars. Per Africanus, Antipater was a &quot;hierodule&quot; of Apollo at a temple in Ashkelon where his father served as priest. To explain Antipater&#x27;s Idumaean character, Africanus claims Antipater was kidnapped by the Idumeans, and following his father&#x27;s failure to pay ransom, he was taken down to Idumaea proper where he was raised in the teachings of Judaism.

Antipater married Cypros, a Nabataean noblewoman, which helped endear the Nabateans to him. Their marriage helped bring about a close friendship between him and King Aretas to whom Cypros was related. The two men had such a relationship that Antipater entrusted his children to his friend when he went to war with the Hasmonean Aristobulus II. They had four sons: Phasael, Herod, Joseph, and Pheroras, and a daughter, Salome, one of several Salomes among the Herodians. Antipater also had a brother named Phalion, who was killed in battle against Aristobulus at Papyron.

Antipater served as a governor of Idumea under King Alexander Jannaeus and Queen Salome Alexandra, the parents of the feuding heirs. Josephus writes that he was a man of great authority among the Idumeans, both wealthy and born into a dignified family. Indeed, it is clear in the various forms of assistance that Antipater provides to both Hyrcanus II, brother of Aristobulus, and the Romans, that he possessed great resources and brilliant military and political capabilities.

==At the Hasmonean court==
Antipater laid the foundation for Herod&#x27;s ascension to the throne of Judea partly through his activities in the court of the Hasmoneans, the heirs of the Maccabees, who were the hereditary leaders of the Jews, and partly by currying favor with the Romans who were growing more involved and dominant over the region at this time.

Soon after Hyrcanus succeeded his widowed mother as ruler and took the office of the high priest, he was attacked by his brother and surrendered. Hyrcanus agreed to retire from public life. Antipater, who seems to have succeeded his father as governor of Idumæa, had reason to fear that King Aristobulus would not retain him in this position. Antipater was known as a seditious and trouble-making man, and he exploited the weak-willed Hyrcanus for the sake of his ambition. After Hyrcanus stepped down, Antipater persuaded him to contend against his brother for his rightful position and even convinced the unsuspecting and reluctant Hyrcanus that his younger brother intended to kill him. He arranged for Hyrcanus to come under the protection of King Aretas III in Petra. Together they attacked Aristobulus in Jerusalem, and there was a great upheaval that drew the attention of Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, the Roman magistrate Pompey had assigned to the eastern Mediterranean province.

Although Pompey and his lieutenant Scaurus initially ruled in Aristobulus’ favor when the brothers brought their case forward, on the third intervention Pompey ordered the brothers to wait. Aristobulus impatiently provoked a political offense that brought Pompey to appoint Hyrcanus the ethnarch of Judea. Hyrcanus proved ineffective as either an administrator, or more importantly, as tax collector. Antipater was able to insinuate himself into a position of influence, and soon exercised the authority that ostensibly belonged to Hyrcanus as high priest. Antipater recognized Rome&#x27;s growing dominance in the region and exploited it to his advantage. Due to his loyalty to Rome and reliability as a statesman, he was placed in charge of Judea, with responsibilities and privileges that included mediating civil disturbance and tax collecting.

==Roman procurator and appointments of sons==
With Hyrcanus established, Antipater thrived and laid the foundation for his family&#x27;s success by navigating conflicts of loyalty and power-shifting within the Roman elite. When Julius Caesar and Pompey went to war in 49/48 BCE, Antipater at first sided with Pompey; when Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus, Antipater shifted his allegiance to Caesar. While Caesar was besieged in Alexandria in 47 BCE, Antipater and Mithridates of Pergamon rescued him with 13,000 men and the aid of numerous nearby friends. For his &quot;demonstrations of valor&quot; Caesar elevated Antipater to Roman citizenship, freed him from taxes, and showered him with honors and declarations of friendship.

Later when accused by Aristobulus’ son, Antigonus, who returned from Roman bondage to contest for power, Antipater made a great scene of his scars from fighting for Caesar&#x27;s life in Egypt. He defended himself with a history of unfailing loyalty to the Romans. This appeal persuaded Caesar who then appointed Antipater the first Roman procurator of Judea. This amity allowed the Jews a special degree of protection and freedom to govern themselves and enjoy Rome&#x27;s good will. Josephus notes that with his newfound rights and honors, Antipater immediately began to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem that Pompey had destroyed when subduing Aristobulus. He established order by tempering civil disturbances in Judea and threatening to become a &quot;severe master instead of a gentle governor&quot; should the people grow seditious and unruly. Matters in Judea were finally calm for a time.

At this time came the defining point in Antipater&#x27;s legacy, whereby he made his sons, Phasael, governor of Jerusalem, and Herod governor of Galilee, to the north of Samaria between the Sea of Galilee and Mediterranean. Herod quickly set about ridding Galilee of what his court historian calls &quot;robbers,&quot; although they may also have been people resisting Roman rule. His activities eventually resulted in complaints raised with the Sanhedrin.

==Assassination and legacy==
After the assassination of Julius Caesar, Antipater was forced to side with Cassius against Mark Antony. When Cassius came to Syria to collect troops, he began to demand harsh tributes, so much so that some entire cities and city curators were sold into slavery. Cassius demanded 700 talents out of Judea, so Antipater split the cost between his two sons. One aristocrat tasked with collecting tribute was Malichus, who disdained Antipater and enraged Cassius by not collecting with haste. However, Antipater saved Malichus from death by expending 100 talents of his own and placating Cassius’ anger.

Although Antipater saved Malichus&#x27; life a second time from a different ruler, Malichus continued to despise Antipater and seek his murder. Josephus presents two opposing reasons, one which would help secure Hyrcanus against the rising threat of Herod, and the other being his desire to quickly dispose of Hyrcanus and take power himself. He devised multiple assassination attempts which Antipater evaded, but he successfully bribed one of Hyrcanus’ cup-bearers to poison and kill Antipater.

Antipater&#x27;s work as power-broker between the Hasmoneans, the Arabians, and the Romans inaugurated dramatic dynamics and steep changes in the history of the Jewish nation. The diplomacy and artful politics of Antipater produced the Herodian dynasty; he paved the way for the rise of his son Herod the Great, who married the Hasmonean princess Mariamne, endeared himself to Rome, and usurped the Judean throne to become king of Judea under Roman influence.

<text>Milan Rastislav Štefánik (; 21 July 1880 – 4 May 1919) was a Slovak politician, diplomat, aviator and astronomer. During World War I, he served at the same time as a general in the French Army and as Minister of War for Czechoslovakia. As one of the leading members of the Czechoslovak National Council (the resistance government), he contributed decisively to the cause of Czechoslovak sovereignty, since the status of Czech- and Slovak-populated territories was one of those in question until shortly before the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1918.

His personal motto was &quot;To Believe, To Love, To Work&quot; (&quot;Veriť, milovať, pracovať&quot;).

== Background ==
Štefánik was born in Kosaras, Nyitra County, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary (now Košariská, Slovakia), on 21 July 1880. He had 11 brothers and sisters, two of whom died at a young age. His father, Pavol Štefánik, was a local Lutheran pastor, and his mother was Albertína Jurenková. He attended schools in Bratislava, Sopron and Szarvas.

In 1898, he began studying construction engineering in Prague. In 1900, he transferred his studies to Charles University, where he attended lectures in astronomy, physics, optics, mathematics and philosophy. For the 1902 summer semester, he went to university in Zürich. The Prague years had a great impact on Štefánik because he met many important personalities there. The philosophy lectures were given by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the future first president of Czechoslovakia, who inspired Štefánik with the idea of co-operation between the Czechs and the Slovaks. Furthermore, Štefánik very actively participated in the work of the Slovak student association, Detvan, (and within Detvan, the so-called Hlasists group); he became acquainted with Vavro Šrobár. His studies were financed largely by Czech associations, including &quot;Českoslovanská jednota&quot; (Czechoslavic Unity) and &quot;Radhošť&quot; since he could not afford them himself. In Prague, he wrote political and artistic texts in which he tried to inform the Czechs of the disastrous situation of the Slovaks at that time. He graduated in 1904 with a doctorate in philosophy and with knowledge of astronomy: his thesis is about a star that was discovered in the Cassiopeia constellation in 1572.

== Scientist ==
In 1904, he went to Paris to find a job in astronomy with a recommendation from a Czech professor who was known in Paris. Initially, he had no money and no command of French, but he was nevertheless able to obtain a job at the famous Paris-Meudon Observatory after its director, Pierre Janssen, one of the cofounders of astrophysics, saw Štefánik&#x27;s talent. Štefánik owed to Janssen and Camille Flammarion his social, political and scientific career. The observatory was the most important centre for astronomy at the time so he gained massive prestige from his job.

Between 20 June and 4 July 1905, Štefánik climbed Mont Blanc (he did so several more times in the following years) to observe the Moon and Mars. Then, he took part in an official French expedition to observe and record a full eclipse of the Sun in Alcossebre, Spain. He thus established his own reputation in French scientific society. He worked with Gaston Millochau, a member of the Académie Française, which made some of its members read his work. His studies and the results of his observations were published in reports to the Académie, and he received several awards for them. Later, he was invited to an international astronomer conference in Oxford on solar research. Between 1906 and 1908, he was co-director of the Mont Blanc observatories company.

In 1907, Štefánik received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society.

At the end of 1907, however, Janssen died and Štefánik lost his job. Since 1908, he had been charged by the French authorities with astronomical and meteorological observations, (mainly observations of solar eclipses) and political tasks in various countries all over the world, including (Algeria, Morocco, Turkistan, Russia, India, the United States, Panama, Brazil, Ecuador, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Fiji, and Tonga). In Tahiti, he also built an observatory and a network of meteorological stations (rumour has it that much of his time in the Pacific Ocean was spent on spying on German positions). Between the trips, he regularly returned home to Košariská (the last time in 1913 for his father&#x27;s funeral). In South America (especially in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador), he had an opportunity to show his diplomatic skills for the first time.

In 1912, a mission from the Bureau des Longitudes, based in France, was led by Milan Rastislav Štefánik, with the assistance of Jaromír Králiček. Štefánik and Králiček arrived in Rio de Janeiro aboard the French steamship Amazone on 10 September 1912. Their equipment crates were promptly cleared by customs with the authorization of the Brazilian government. Štefánik brought with great consideration a set of equipment intended for the Brazilian National Observatory, which Morize had ordered from manufacturers in January 1912 to be used by the Brazilian team in the observation of the eclipse. This equipment included a Mailhat telescope with an impressive 8-meter focal length and a 15-centimeter aperture, coupled with a coelostat from the same manufacturer. The French team had the objectives of photographing the solar corona and conducting spectroscopic studies. They set up in a location near Passa Quatro (Minas Gerais), where they joined the main team of the National Observatory&#x27;s expedition. In the city of Passa Quatro, there is a bust in honor of the astronomer Milan Rastislav Štefánik. What drew attention was that their equipment crates were immediately released by customs, thanks to the authorization of the Brazilian government.

Milan Rastislav Štefánik showed great generosity by bringing a set of equipment intended for the Brazilian National Observatory to be used by the Brazilian team in observing the eclipse. This set included an impressive Mailhat telescope with an 8-meter focal length and a 15-centimeter aperture. Štefánik&#x27;s presence and his equipment were valuable contributions to the advancement of science and astronomical research in Brazil at that time.

Štefánik worked in astrophysics and solar physics, and became well known for his spectral analysis of the Sun&#x27;s corona. He was involved in perfecting spectrography and has been considered a predecessor of Bernard Lyot. He also attempted to construct a machine for colour photography and cinematography, and he had his design patented in 1911.

==Diplomacy==
In addition to his scientific missions overseas, he also performed diplomatic tasks. He established contacts and friendships with leading scientific, artistic, political, diplomatic and business personalities. He participated in the establishment of business enterprises in France and other countries. His friends included physicist Henri Poincaré, Aymar de la Baume, Joseph Vallot (the richest man in France), architect Gustave Eiffel, Roland Bonaparte, Prime Minister Camille Chautemps, a French entrepreneur called Devousoud from Chamonix, American astronomer and admiral Simon Newcomb and American diplomat David Jayne Hill. In 1912, he received French citizenship, recognition and access to the French élite. On 20 October 1917, he was made a &quot;Grand Officier&quot; of the Legion of Honour. At the same time, he had some personal problems and a serious stomach illness, which did not get better even after two surgeries. Moreover, World War I had started in Europe.

== World War I ==

Štefánik believed that defeat of Austria-Hungary and of Imperial Germany would offer an opportunity for the Slovaks and the Czechs to gain independence from Austria-Hungary after the war. Therefore, he joined the French army and trained to become an aviator. He flew MFS-54s for the 10th Army on the Artois and was later transferred to MFS 99 Squadron on the Serbian Front. In May 1915, he flew a total of 30 missions over enemy territory. The Serbian campaign was unsuccessful, but French aviator Louis Paulhan is credited with the world&#x27;s first &quot;medevac&quot; by flying the seriously-ill Štefánik to safety.

Štefánik returned to Paris at the end of 1915, where he became acquainted with Edvard Beneš and renewed his association with his former professor, Masaryk. In 1916, the three men founded the Czechoslovak National Council, which led to the government of Czecho-Slovak resistance abroad and to the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. After 1917, he became vice president of the council. His diplomatic skills made Štefánik able to help arrange a meeting of Masaryk and Beneš to meet and obtain the support of some of the most important personalities of the Triple Entente. For example, he organized Masaryk&#x27;s meeting with the French prime minister, Aristide Briand.

In 1916, Štefánik and the Czecho-Slovak resistance started to organise the Czechoslovak Legions to fight against Austria-Hungary and Germany. For this purpose, Štefánik, both as the Czechoslovak Minister of War and as a French general, went to Russia in February 1917 and then to the United States, in the meantime he met Thomas Garrigue Masaryk in London in April. He also organized legions in France and Italy. It was largely his personal diplomatic skills and contacts that made the Entente recognise the Czechoslovak National Council as a &quot;de facto&quot; government and the Czechoslovak Legions as allied forces in the summer and the autumn of 1918.

In May 1918 Štefánik went to Siberia to try to rally the Czechoslovak legions to a renewal of the Eastern Front, as Bolshevik Russia had withdrawn from the war by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany and Austria-Hungary in March 1918. The Czechoslovak Legions rebelled against a subsequent Bolshevik order to disarm and so gained the support of the Allies. Štefánik then decided that his initial plan was no longer feasible.

==Independence==
In January 1919 after the war ended, Štefánik went from Russia to France and Italy, where he organized the March retreat of Czechoslovak troops from Siberia to Paris. In addition, his diplomatic skills were needed to solve disagreements between the French and the Italian missions in Czechoslovakia. In April, he went from Paris to Rome to negotiate with the Italian Ministry of War, where he met with his fiancée, Juliana Benzoni, for the last time. Then, he went to the main Italian military base in Padua, where he agreed with General Armando Diaz to dissolve the Italian military mission in Czechoslovakia.

Sources do not substantiate rumours of disagreements arising between Štefánik and Beneš or Masaryk, mainly on the position of Slovakia in Czechoslovakia. On the contrary, telegrams sent by Štefánik from Vladivostok to the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris on 7 December 1918 indicate that Štefánik had a good relationship with them. To Masaryk, he wrote &quot;with my filial feelings and a great patriotic happiness, I salute you, venerable professor, as the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic&quot;. To the President of the Council, Karel Kramář, he wrote, &quot;Thank you, my dear president, for having chosen me as member of our National Ministry. You and your other co-workers can be sure of my loyalty and my fraternal feelings&quot;. To Beneš, he was even more friendly by using informal pronouns (he used formal pronouns to address Masaryk and Kramář): &quot;Mr. Beneš, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague: &quot;I hug you affectionately, my loyal and precious companion during the hours of anxiety&quot;. (The beginning can be translated instead as &quot;I kiss you on the cheek&quot;.) The telegrams appear to show that Štefánik gave his full support to the union of the Czechs and Slovaks that was led by Masaryk.

Masaryk continued to accord Štefánik his full confidence to the last days of his life, as demonstrated by the challenging issue that Štefánik had to solve while he was Minister of War of the Czechoslovak Republic: disputes with the military missions of France and Italy on Czechoslovak territory, according to his telegram to Masaryk on 21 April 1919, only a few days before Štefánik died.

== Death ==

When Štefánik wanted to return home to see his family, he decided to fly from Campoformido, near Udine, Italy, and to use an Italian military plane, a Caproni Ca.3. On 4 May 1919, at around 11:00, his plane tried to land near Bratislava, a military conflict area between the First Republic of Czechoslovakia and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, but crashed near Ivanka pri Dunaji. Štefánik died, along with the rest of the crew (two Italian pilots, Colonel Giotto Mancinelli Scotti and Sergeant Umberto Merlino, as well as a mechanic-radiotelegrapher, Gabriel Aggiusto).

At the time of the crash, Vavro Šrobár and his entire government had left Bratislava for Skalica, to plant trees as a memorial to the founding of the new Czechoslovak Republic. The Hungarian communists, in the middle of Bratislava&#x27;s Franz Joseph Bridge, could not have shot down the plane.

The Italian plane&#x27;s identifying colours, a rumour had it, were mistaken for the similar marking of a Hungarian plane so the unannounced, unknown airplane was shot down by the Czechoslovak Army. However, the respected Zrínyi Miklós National Defense University in Budapest, in a joint article with the Armed Forces Academy of General Milan Rastislav Štefánik in Slovakia, published a paper, citing the Italian eyewitness First Lieutenant Martinelli-Scotti: &quot;in the course of the first landing attempt, the wheels touched the landing path, after which the cooling water immediately started leaking. That caused the overheating of the engines. During the second landing attempt, one of the engines exploded, resulting in catastrophe&quot;.

The paper also stated that the accident report from the Italian inquiry board was biased toward ruling out both human error by the Italian crew and manufacturing defects.

==Legacy and awards==

Štefánik&#x27;s tomb was built in 1927 to 1928 on Bradlo Hill in Brezová pod Bradlom. The monumental but austere memorial was designed by Dušan Jurkovič.
The minor planet 3571 Milanštefánik (discovered 1982 at Kleť Observatory) was named after him.

Bratislava Airport was named M.R. Štefánik Airport. (Slovak: &quot;Letisko M. R. Štefánika&quot;)

Slovak Government Flying Service aircraft Airbus 319 and Fokker 100 are painted with Štefánik&#x27;s portrait.

The Slovak Armed Forces Academy is named as Armed Forces Academy of General Milan Rastislav Štefánik.

The transport wing of the Slovak Air Force located at Malacky Air Base was named as Transport Wing of General Milan Rastislav Štefánik.

In 2019, Slovakia launched a 2 euro commemorative coin commemorating the 100th death anniversary of Štefánik.

In 2019, Štefánik was selected as the &quot;Greatest Slovak&quot; in the Slovak version of the British programme 100 Greatest Britons.

In 2020, Slovak Matica created a film about Štefánik &quot;Visionary of Slovak Freedom&quot; with the subtitle &quot;Štefánik and the Slovaks in the first foreign Czech-Slovak resistance&quot;.

In 1914, Štefánik was awarded the &quot;Chevalier&quot; rank of the French Legion of Honour, in 1917, he was awarded the &quot;Officier&quot; rank and finally in 1919 the &quot;Commandeur&quot; rank. Furthermore, in France, in 1915 he was awarded the Croix de guerre and Medal for the War Wounded. In Italy, he was awarded the War Merit Cross and the Officer rank of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. In Russia, he was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir, 4th class. Posthumously, he was awarded the Czechoslovak War Cross 1918. In 2023, he was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Lion 1st class, by the Czech president Petr Pavel.

<text>Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is a research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) formed by the 2003 merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab). Housed within the Ray and Maria Stata Center, CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership. It is part of the Schwarzman College of Computing but is also overseen by the MIT Vice President of Research.

== Research activities ==
CSAIL&#x27;s research activities are organized around a number of semi-autonomous research groups, each of which is headed by one or more professors or research scientists. These groups are divided up into seven general areas of research:
* Artificial intelligence
* Computational biology
* Graphics and vision
* Language and learning
* Theory of computation
* Robotics
* Systems (includes computer architecture, databases, distributed systems, networks and networked systems, operating systems, programming methodology, and software engineering, among others)

== History ==
Computing Research at MIT began with Vannevar Bush&#x27;s research into a differential analyzer and Claude Shannon&#x27;s electronic Boolean algebra in the 1930s, the wartime MIT Radiation Laboratory, the post-war Project Whirlwind and Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), and MIT Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s SAGE in the early 1950s. At MIT, research in the field of artificial intelligence began in the late 1950s.

=== Project MAC ===
On July 1, 1963, Project MAC (the Project on Mathematics and Computation, later backronymed to Multiple Access Computer, Machine Aided Cognitions, or Man and Computer) was launched with a $2 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Project MAC&#x27;s original director was Robert Fano of MIT&#x27;s Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). Fano decided to call MAC a &quot;project&quot; rather than a &quot;laboratory&quot; for reasons of internal MIT politics – if MAC had been called a laboratory, then it would have been more difficult to raid other MIT departments for research staff. The program manager responsible for the DARPA grant was J. C. R. Licklider, who had previously been at MIT conducting research in RLE, and would later succeed Fano as director of Project MAC.

Project MAC would become famous for groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. Its contemporaries included Project Genie at Berkeley, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and (somewhat later) University of Southern California&#x27;s (USC&#x27;s) Information Sciences Institute.

An &quot;AI Group&quot; including Marvin Minsky (the director), John McCarthy (inventor of Lisp), and a talented community of computer programmers were incorporated into Project MAC. They were interested principally in the problems of vision, mechanical motion and manipulation, and language, which they view as the keys to more intelligent machines. In the 1960s and 1970s the AI Group developed a time-sharing operating system called Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) which ran on PDP-6 and later PDP-10 computers.

The early Project MAC community included Fano, Minsky, Licklider, Fernando J. Corbató, and a community of computer programmers and enthusiasts among others who drew their inspiration from former colleague John McCarthy. These founders envisioned the creation of a computer utility whose computational power would be as reliable as an electric utility. To this end, Corbató brought the first computer time-sharing system, Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), with him from the MIT Computation Center, using the DARPA funding to purchase an IBM 7094 for research use. One of the early focuses of Project MAC would be the development of a successor to CTSS, Multics, which was to be the first high availability computer system, developed as a part of an industry consortium including General Electric and Bell Laboratories.

In 1966, &quot;Scientific American&quot; featured Project MAC in the September thematic issue devoted to computer science, that was later published in book form. At the time, the system was described as having approximately 100 TTY terminals, mostly on campus but with a few in private homes. Only 30 users could be logged in at the same time. The project enlisted students in various classes to use the terminals simultaneously in problem solving, simulations, and multi-terminal communications as tests for the multi-access computing software being developed.

=== AI Lab and LCS ===
In the late 1960s, Minsky&#x27;s artificial intelligence group was seeking more space, and was unable to get satisfaction from project director Licklider. Minsky found that although Project MAC as a single entity could not get the additional space he wanted, he could split off to form his own laboratory and then be entitled to more office space. As a result, the MIT AI Lab was formed in 1970, and many of Minsky&#x27;s AI colleagues left Project MAC to join him in the new laboratory, while most of the remaining members went on to form the Laboratory for Computer Science. Talented programmers such as Richard Stallman, who used TECO to develop EMACS, flourished in the AI Lab during this time.

Those researchers who did not join the smaller AI Lab formed the Laboratory for Computer Science and continued their research into operating systems, programming languages, distributed systems, and the theory of computation. Two professors, Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, chose to remain neutral — their group was referred to variously as Switzerland and Project MAC for the next 30 years.

Among much else, the AI Lab led to the invention of Lisp machines and their attempted commercialization by two companies in the 1980s: Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc. This divided the AI Lab into &quot;camps&quot; which resulted in a hiring away of many of the talented programmers. The incident inspired Richard Stallman&#x27;s later work on the GNU Project. &quot;Nobody had envisioned that the AI lab&#x27;s hacker group would be wiped out, but it was.&quot; ... &quot;That is the basis for the free software movement — the experience I had, the life that I&#x27;ve lived at the MIT AI lab — to be working on human knowledge, and not be standing in the way of anybody&#x27;s further using and further disseminating human knowledge&quot;.

=== CSAIL ===
On the fortieth anniversary of Project MAC&#x27;s establishment, July 1, 2003, LCS was merged with the AI Lab to form the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, or CSAIL. This merger created the largest laboratory (over 600 personnel) on the MIT campus and was regarded as a reuniting of the diversified elements of Project MAC.

In 2018, CSAIL launched a five-year collaboration program with IFlytek, a company sanctioned the following year for allegedly using its technology for surveillance and human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In October 2019, MIT announced that it would review its partnerships with sanctioned firms such as iFlyTek and SenseTime. In April 2020, the agreement with iFlyTek was terminated.

CSAIL moved from the School of Engineering to the newly formed Schwarzman College of Computing by February 2020.

== Offices ==
From 1963 to 2004, Project MAC, LCS, the AI Lab, and CSAIL had their offices at 545 Technology Square, taking over more and more floors of the building over the years. In 2004, CSAIL moved to the new Ray and Maria Stata Center, which was built specifically to house it and other departments.

== Outreach activities ==
The IMARA (from Swahili word for &quot;power&quot;) group sponsors a variety of outreach programs that bridge the global digital divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of CSAIL and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater Boston, Massachusetts, Kenya, Native American Indian tribal reservations in the American Southwest such as the Navajo Nation, the Middle East, and Fiji Islands. The CommuniTech project strives to empower under-served communities through sustainable technology and education and does this through the MIT Used Computer Factory (UCF), providing refurbished computers to under-served families, and through the Families Accessing Computer Technology (FACT) classes, it trains those families to become familiar and comfortable with computer technology.

<text>The National Unification Council was a nonstatutory governmental agency of the Republic of China on Taiwan established on 7 October 1990. Now defunct, its formal aim was to promote the reintegration of mainland China into the Republic of China.

In February 1991, the council drafted the Guidelines for National Unification, which outlined a three-phase approach for Chinese unification. The Guidelines called for the People&#x27;s Republic of China to democratize and become more developed as the precondition for serious talks about steps toward eventual unification.

The council was suspended and ceased to function in early 2006 during the presidency of Chen Shui-bian, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party which has generally promoted Taiwanese nationalism.

==Establishment==
The National Unification Council was established under the direct oversight of the Office of the President by then-President Lee Teng-hui. It first met on 7 October 1990, with 30 members. Membership extended to government officials, political party leaders, industrialists, civic leaders, scholars and journalists. The National Unification Council held 14 meetings from its founding to 8 April 1999.

In February 1991, the council drafted the Guidelines for National Unification, which outlined a three-phase approach for Chinese unification. The Guidelines called for Beijing to democratize and become more developed as the precondition for serious talks about steps toward eventual integration. The guidelines stipulate that &quot;both the mainland and Taiwan areas are parts of Chinese territory. Helping to bring about national unification should be the common responsibility of all Chinese people.&quot;

On 1 August 1992, the NUC passed the &quot;Definition of One China Resolution,&quot; stating: &quot;The two sides of the Taiwan Strait uphold the One China principle, but the interpretations of the two sides are different ... Our side believes that one China should mean the Republic of China, established in 1912 and existing today, and its sovereignty extends throughout China, but its current governing authority is only over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matzu. Admittedly, Taiwan is part of China, but the mainland is also a part of China.&quot; This would later develop into the 1992 Consensus.

==Abolition==
The council had already been out of operation under the administration of Chen Shui-bian since 2000, who has leaned towards Taiwanese independence and opposed Chinese unification. At the same time, in his &quot;Four Noes and One Without&quot; policy, Chen promised not to formally abolish the council or the Guidelines for National Unification, in order to allay international concern about his possible moves toward declaring independence.

In his lunar new year speech in 2006 President Chen Shui-bian instructed the Democratic Progressive Party to begin formal debate on the permanent abolition of the National Unification Council and the guidelines set out therein. On 27 February 2006, Chen formally announced that the council would &quot;cease to function&quot; and its guidelines would &quot;cease to apply&quot;. President Chen Shui-bian declared that the Guidelines for National Unification had &quot;ceased to apply&quot; because they had been drawn up by an ad hoc presidential commission in the days before citizens had the right to elect their leader and make their voices effectively heard. Moreover, the framers of the guidelines had premised them on a &quot;one-China principle&quot; and the presumption of eventual unification without consulting the people of Taiwan.

The council was suspended in early 2006, with President Chen Shui-bian remarking:

&quot;The National Unification Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines will cease to apply. In accordance with procedures, this decision will be transmitted to the Executive Yuan for notice.&quot;

Chen had previously called for the NUC to be &quot;abolished&quot; but later toned this down to &quot;cease to function&quot;. The government was ambiguous on whether &quot;cease to function&quot; was the same as &quot;abolish&quot;.

There have been calls for President Ma Ying-jeou to reinstate the National Unification Council, with Taiwan newspaper &quot;The China Post&quot; remarking in a commentary:

The best and easiest way to show his sincerity is to reinstate the National Unification Council made to cease to function by President Chen. Or to sign a peace accord with Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

<text>In mathematics, catastrophe theory is a branch of bifurcation theory in the study of dynamical systems; it is also a particular special case of more general singularity theory in geometry.

Bifurcation theory studies and classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances, analysing how the qualitative nature of equation solutions depends on the parameters that appear in the equation. This may lead to sudden and dramatic changes, for example the unpredictable timing and magnitude of a landslide.

Catastrophe theory originated with the work of the French mathematician René Thom in the 1960s, and became very popular due to the efforts of Christopher Zeeman in the 1970s. It considers the special case where the long-run stable equilibrium can be identified as the minimum of a smooth, well-defined potential function (Lyapunov function).
Small changes in certain parameters of a nonlinear system can cause equilibria to appear or disappear, or to change from attracting to repelling and vice versa, leading to large and sudden changes of the behaviour of the system. However, examined in a larger parameter space, catastrophe theory reveals that such bifurcation points tend to occur as part of well-defined qualitative geometrical structures.

In the late 1970s, applications of catastrophe theory to areas outside its scope began to be criticized, especially in biology and social sciences. Zahler and Sussmann, in a 1977 article in &quot;Nature&quot;, referred to such applications as being &quot;characterised by incorrect reasoning, far-fetched assumptions, erroneous consequences, and exaggerated claims&quot;. As a result, catastrophe theory has become less popular in applications.

==Elementary catastrophes==
Catastrophe theory analyzes &quot;degenerate critical points&quot; of the potential function — points where not just the first derivative, but one or more higher derivatives of the potential function are also zero. These are called the germs of the catastrophe geometries. The degeneracy of these critical points can be &quot;unfolded&quot; by expanding the potential function as a Taylor series in small perturbations of the parameters.

When the degenerate points are not merely accidental, but are structurally stable, the degenerate points exist as organising centres for particular geometric structures of lower degeneracy, with critical features in the parameter space around them. If the potential function depends on two or fewer active variables, and four or fewer active parameters, then there are only seven generic structures for these bifurcation geometries, with corresponding standard forms into which the Taylor series around the catastrophe germs can be transformed by diffeomorphism (a smooth transformation whose inverse is also smooth). These seven fundamental types are now presented, with the names that Thom gave them.

==Potential functions of one active variable==
Catastrophe theory studies dynamical systems that describe the evolution of a state variable formula_1 over time formula_2:
:formula_3

In the above equation, formula_4 is referred to as the potential function, and formula_5 is often a vector or a scalar which parameterise the potential function. The value of formula_5 may change over time, and it can also be referred to as the control variable. In the following examples, parameters like formula_7 are such controls.

=== Fold catastrophe ===
:formula_8

When , the potential &quot;V&quot; has two extrema - one stable, and one unstable. If the parameter &quot;a&quot; is slowly increased, the system can follow the stable minimum point. But at the stable and unstable extrema meet, and annihilate. This is the bifurcation point. At there is no longer a stable solution. If a physical system is followed through a fold bifurcation, one therefore finds that as &quot;a&quot; reaches 0, the stability of the solution is suddenly lost, and the system will make a sudden transition to a new, very different behaviour. This bifurcation value of the parameter &quot;a&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;tipping point&quot;.

=== Cusp catastrophe===

formula_9

The cusp geometry is very common when one explores what happens to a fold bifurcation if a second parameter, &quot;b&quot;, is added to the control space. Varying the parameters, one finds that there is now a &quot;curve&quot; (blue) of points in (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) space where stability is lost, where the stable solution will suddenly jump to an alternate outcome.

But in a cusp geometry the bifurcation curve loops back on itself, giving a second branch where this alternate solution itself loses stability, and will make a jump back to the original solution set. By repeatedly increasing &quot;b&quot; and then decreasing it, one can therefore observe hysteresis loops, as the system alternately follows one solution, jumps to the other, follows the other back, and then jumps back to the first.

However, this is only possible in the region of parameter space . As &quot;a&quot; is increased, the hysteresis loops become smaller and smaller, until above they disappear altogether (the cusp catastrophe), and there is only one stable solution.

One can also consider what happens if one holds &quot;b&quot; constant and varies &quot;a&quot;. In the symmetrical case , one observes a pitchfork bifurcation as &quot;a&quot; is reduced, with one stable solution suddenly splitting into two stable solutions and one unstable solution as the physical system passes to through the cusp point (0,0) (an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking). Away from the cusp point, there is no sudden change in a physical solution being followed: when passing through the curve of fold bifurcations, all that happens is an alternate second solution becomes available.

A famous suggestion is that the cusp catastrophe can be used to model the behaviour of a stressed dog, which may respond by becoming cowed or becoming angry. The suggestion is that at moderate stress (), the dog will exhibit a smooth transition of response from cowed to angry, depending on how it is provoked. But higher stress levels correspond to moving to the region (). Then, if the dog starts cowed, it will remain cowed as it is irritated more and more, until it reaches the &#x27;fold&#x27; point, when it will suddenly, discontinuously snap through to angry mode. Once in &#x27;angry&#x27; mode, it will remain angry, even if the direct irritation parameter is considerably reduced.

A simple mechanical system, the &quot;Zeeman Catastrophe Machine&quot;, nicely illustrates a cusp catastrophe. In this device, smooth variations in the position of the end of a spring can cause sudden changes in the rotational position of an attached wheel.

Catastrophic failure of a complex system with parallel redundancy can be evaluated based on the relationship between local and external stresses. The model of the structural fracture mechanics is similar to the cusp catastrophe behavior. The model predicts reserve ability of a complex system.

Other applications include the outer sphere electron transfer frequently encountered in chemical and biological systems, modelling the dynamics of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere, and modelling real estate prices.

Fold bifurcations and the cusp geometry are by far the most important practical consequences of catastrophe theory. They are patterns which reoccur again and again in physics, engineering and mathematical modelling.
They produce the strong gravitational lensing events and provide astronomers with one of the methods used for detecting black holes and the dark matter of the universe, via the phenomenon of gravitational lensing producing multiple images of distant quasars.

The remaining simple catastrophe geometries are very specialised in comparison.

===Swallowtail catastrophe===
:formula_10

The control parameter space is three-dimensional. The bifurcation set in parameter space is made up of three surfaces of fold bifurcations, which meet in two lines of cusp bifurcations, which in turn meet at a single swallowtail bifurcation point.

As the parameters go through the surface of fold bifurcations, one minimum and one maximum of the potential function disappear. At the cusp bifurcations, two minima and one maximum are replaced by one minimum; beyond them the fold bifurcations disappear. At the swallowtail point, two minima and two maxima all meet at a single value of &quot;x&quot;. For values of , beyond the swallowtail, there is either one maximum-minimum pair, or none at all, depending on the values of &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. Two of the surfaces of fold bifurcations, and the two lines of cusp bifurcations where they meet for , therefore disappear at the swallowtail point, to be replaced with only a single surface of fold bifurcations remaining. Salvador Dalí&#x27;s last painting, &quot;The Swallow&#x27;s Tail&quot;, was based on this catastrophe.

===Butterfly catastrophe===

:formula_11

Depending on the parameter values, the potential function may have three, two, or one different local minima, separated by the loci of fold bifurcations. At the butterfly point, the different 3-surfaces of fold bifurcations, the 2-surfaces of cusp bifurcations, and the lines of swallowtail bifurcations all meet up and disappear, leaving a single cusp structure remaining when .

==Potential functions of two active variables==

Umbilic catastrophes are examples of corank 2 catastrophes. They can be observed in optics in the focal surfaces created by light reflecting off a surface in three dimensions and are intimately connected with the geometry of nearly spherical surfaces: umbilical point.
Thom proposed that the hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe modeled the breaking of a wave and the elliptical umbilic modeled the creation of hair-like structures.

===Hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe===
:formula_12

===Elliptic umbilic catastrophe===
:formula_13

===Parabolic umbilic catastrophe===
:formula_14

==Arnold&#x27;s notation==
Vladimir Arnold gave the catastrophes the ADE classification, due to a deep connection with simple Lie groups. 
*&quot;A&quot;0 - a non-singular point: formula_15.
*&quot;A&quot;1 - a local extremum, either a stable minimum or unstable maximum formula_16.
*&quot;A&quot;2 - the fold
*&quot;A&quot;3 - the cusp
*&quot;A&quot;4 - the swallowtail
*&quot;A&quot;5 - the butterfly
*&quot;A&quot;k - a representative of an infinite sequence of one variable forms formula_17
*&quot;D&quot;4− - the elliptical umbilic
*&quot;D&quot;4+ - the hyperbolic umbilic
*&quot;D&quot;5 - the parabolic umbilic
*&quot;D&quot;k - a representative of an infinite sequence of further umbilic forms
*&quot;E&quot;6 - the symbolic umbilic formula_18
*&quot;E&quot;7
*&quot;E&quot;8
There are objects in singularity theory which correspond to most of the other simple Lie groups.

== Optics ==

As predicted by catastrophe theory, singularities are generic, and stable under perturbation. This explains how the bright lines and surfaces are stable under perturbation. The caustics one sees at the bottom of a swimming pool, for example, have a distinctive texture and only has a few types of singular points, even though the surface of the water is ever changing.

The edge of the rainbow, for example, has a fold catastrophe. Due to the wave nature of light, the catastrophe has fine diffraction details described by the Airy function. This is a generic result and does not depend on the precise shape of the water droplet, and so the edge of the rainbow always has the shape of an Airy function. The same Airy function fold catastrophe can be seen in nuclear-nuclear scattering (&quot;nuclear rainbow&quot;).

The cusp catastrophe is the next-simplest to observe. Due to the wave nature of light, the catastrophe has fine diffraction details described by the Pearcey function. Higher-order catastrophes, such as the swallowtail and the butterfly, have also been observed.

<doc id="434293" wikidata="Q172862" url="?curid=434293" title="Al-Hallaj">
<text>Mansour al-Hallaj () or Mansour Hallaj () ( 26 March 922) (Hijri 309 AH) was a Persian mystic, poet, and teacher of Sufism. He is best known for his saying, &quot;I am the Truth&quot; (&quot;Ana&#x27;l-Ḥaqq&quot;), which many saw as a claim to divinity, while others interpreted it as an instance of annihilation of the ego, allowing God to speak through him. Al-Hallaj gained a wide following as a preacher before he became implicated in power struggles of the Abbasid court and was executed after a long period of confinement on religious and political charges. Although most of his Sufi contemporaries disapproved of his actions, Hallaj later became a major figure in the Sufi tradition.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Al-Hallaj was born around 858 in Pars Province of the Abbasid Empire to a cotton-carder (&quot;Hallaj&quot; means &quot;cotton-carder&quot; in Arabic) in an Arabized town called al-Bayḍā&#x27;. His grandfather was a Zoroastrian magus. His father moved to a town in Wasit famous for its school of Quran reciters. Al-Hallaj memorized the Qur&#x27;an before he was 12 years old and would often retreat from worldly pursuits to join other mystics in study at the school of Sahl al-Tustari. During this period al-Hallaj lost his ability to speak Persian and later wrote exclusively in Arabic. Al-Hallaj was a Sunni Muslim.

When he was twenty, al-Hallaj moved to Basra, where he married and received his Sufi habit from &#x27;Amr Makkī, although his lifelong and monogamous marriage later provoked jealousy and opposition from the latter. Through his brother-in-law, al-Hallaj found himself in contact with a Zaydi Shi&#x27;i clan that supported the Zanj Rebellion.

Al-Hallaj later went to Baghdad to consult the famous Sufi teacher Junayd of Baghdad, but he was tired of the conflict that existed between his father-in-law and &#x27;Amr Makkī and he set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca, against the advice of Junayd, as soon as the Zanj Rebellion was crushed.

=== Pilgrimages and travels ===

In Mecca he made a vow to remain for one year in the courtyard of the sanctuary in fasting and total silence. When he returned from Mecca, he laid down the Sufi tunic and adopted a &quot;lay habit&quot; in order to be able to preach more freely. At that time a number of Sunnis, including former Christians who would later become viziers at the Abbasid court, became his disciples, but other Sufis were scandalized, while some Muʿtazilis and Shias who held high posts in the government accused him of deception and incited the mob against him. Al-Hallaj left for eastern Iran and remained there for five years, preaching in the Arab colonies and fortified monasteries that housed volunteer fighters in the jihad, after which he was able to return and install his family in Baghdad.

Al-Hallaj made his second pilgrimage to Mecca with four hundred disciples, where some Sufis, his former friends, accused him of sorcery and making a pact with the jinn. Afterwards he set out on a long voyage that took him to India and Turkestan beyond the frontiers of Islamic lands. About 290/902 he returned to Mecca for his final pilgrimage clad in an Indian loin-cloth and a patched garment over his shoulders. There he prayed to God to be made despised and rejected, so that God alone might grant grace to Himself through His servant&#x27;s lips.

===Imprisonment and execution===

After returning to his family in Baghdad, al-Hallaj began making proclamations that aroused popular emotion and caused anxiety among the educated classes. These included avowing his burning love of God and his desire to &quot;die accursed for the Community&quot;, and statements such as &quot;O Muslims, save me from God&quot; ... &quot;God has made my blood lawful to you: kill me&quot;. It was at that time that al-Hallaj is said to have pronounced his famous shath &quot;I am the Truth&quot;. He was denounced at the court, but a Shafi&#x27;i jurist refused to condemn him, stating that spiritual inspiration was beyond his jurisdiction.

Al-Hallaj&#x27;s preaching had by now inspired a movement for moral and political reform in Baghdad. In 296/908 Sunni reformers made an unsuccessful attempt to depose the underage caliph al-Muqtadir. When he was restored, his Shi&#x27;i vizier unleashed anti-Hanbali repressions which prompted al-Hallaj to flee Baghdad, but three years later he was arrested, brought back, and put in prison, where he remained for nine years.

The conditions of al-Hallaj&#x27;s confinement varied depending on the relative sway his opponents and supporters held at the court, but he was finally condemned to death in 922 on the charge of being a Qarmatian rebel who wished to destroy the Kaaba, because he had said &quot;the important thing is to proceed seven times around the Kaaba of one&#x27;s heart.&quot; According to another report, the pretext was his recommendation to build local replicas of the Kaaba for those who are unable to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. The queen-mother interceded with the caliph who initially revoked the execution order, but the intrigues of the vizier finally moved him to approve it. On 23 Dhu &#x27;l-Qa&#x27;da (March 25) trumpets announced his execution the next day. The words he spoke during the last night in his cell are collected in &quot;Akhbar al-Hallaj&quot;. Thousands of people witnessed his execution on the banks of the Tigris River. He was first punched in the face by his executioner, then lashed until unconscious, and then decapitated or hanged. Witnesses reported that al-Hallaj&#x27;s last words under torture were &quot;all that matters for the ecstatic is that the Unique should reduce him to Unity&quot;, after which he recited the Quranic verse 42:18. His body was doused in oil and set alight, and his ashes were then scattered into the river. A cenotaph was &quot;quickly&quot; built on the site of his execution, and &quot;drew pilgrims for a millennium&quot; until being swept away by a Tigris flood during the 1920s.

Some question whether al-Hallaj was executed for religious reasons as has been commonly assumed. According to Carl W. Ernst, the legal notion of blasphemy was not clearly defined in Islamic law and statements of this kind were treated inconsistently by legal authorities. In practice, since apostasy was subsumed under the category of &quot;zandaqa&quot;, which reflected the Zoroastrian legacy of viewing heresy as a political crime, they were prosecuted only when it was politically convenient. Sadakat Kadri points out that &quot;it was far from conventional to punish heresy in the tenth century,&quot; and it is thought he would have been spared execution except that the vizier of caliph al-Muqtadir wished to discredit &quot;certain figures who had associated themselves&quot; with al-Hallaj. (Previously al-Hallaj had been punished for talking about being at one with God by being shaved, pilloried and beaten with the flat of a sword, not executed because the Shafi&#x27;ite judge had ruled that his words were not &quot;proof of disbelief.&quot;)

== Teachings and practices ==
Al-Hallaj addressed himself to popular audiences encouraging them to find God inside their own souls, which earned him the title of &quot;the carder of innermost souls&quot; (ḥallāj al-asrār). He preached without the traditional Sufi habit and used language familiar to the local Shi&#x27;i population. This may have given the impression that he was a Qarmatian missionary rather than a Sufi. His prayer to God to make him lost and despised can be regarded as typical for a Sufi seeking annihilation in God, although Louis Massignon has interpreted it as an expression of a desire to sacrifice himself as atonement on behalf of all Muslims. When al-Hallaj returned to Baghdad from his last pilgrimage to Mecca, he built a model of the Kaaba in his home for private worship.

Al-Hallaj was popularly credited with numerous supernatural acts. He was said to have &quot;lit four hundred oil lamps in Jerusalem&#x27;s Church of the Holy Sepulchre with his finger and extinguished an eternal flame in a Zoroastrian fire temple with the tug of a sleeve.&quot;

Among other Sufis, al-Hallaj was an anomaly. Many Sufi masters felt that it was inappropriate to share mysticism with the masses, yet al-Hallaj openly did so in his writings and through his teachings. This was exacerbated by occasions when he would fall into trances which he attributed to being in the presence of God.

Hallaj was also accused of ḥulūl &quot;incarnationism&quot;, the basis of which charge seems to be a disputed verse in which the author proclaims mystical union in terms of two spirits in one body. This position was criticized for not affirming union and unity strongly enough; there are two spirits left whereas the Sufi fana&#x27; texts speak of utter annihilation and annihilation in annihilation (the annihilation of the consciousness of annihilation), with only one actor, the deity, left. Saer El-Jaichi has argued &quot;that in speaking of the unity with the divine in terms of ḥulūl, Hallaj does not mean the fusion (or, mingling) of the divine and human substances.&quot; Rather, he has in mind &quot;a heightened sense of awareness that culminates in the fulfillment of a spiritual – super-sensory – vision of God’s presence.&quot;

Edward Said succinctly described al-Hallaj as &quot;quasi-Christlike.&quot;

There are conflicting reports about his most famous &quot;shaṭḥ&quot;, &quot;Anā l-Ḥaqq&quot; &quot;I am The Truth, &quot; which was taken to mean that he was claiming to be God, since &quot;al-Ḥaqq&quot; &quot;the Truth&quot; is one of the names of God in Islam. While meditating, he uttered The earliest report, coming from a hostile account of Basra grammarians, states that he said it in the mosque of al-Mansur, while testimonies that emerged decades later claimed that it was said in private during consultations with Junayd Baghdadi. Even though this utterance has become inseparably associated with his execution in the popular imagination, owing in part to its inclusion in his biography by Attar of Nishapur, the historical issues surrounding his execution are far more complex. In another controversial statement, al-Hallaj claimed &quot;There is nothing wrapped in my turban but God, &quot; and similarly he would point to his cloak and say, &quot;Mā fī jubbatī illā l-Lāh&quot; &quot;There is nothing in my cloak but God.&quot; He also wrote:

In the 11th volume of the proto-Salafist Ibn Kathir&#x27;s book &quot;al-Bidaya wa-l-Nihaya&quot;, it is said that al-Hallaj used to deceive people by putting on plays with his hired men under the guise of spiritual healing, and extorting money from them by cunning and secret, and it is also stated that, he came to India to learn and practice Indian magic. Ibn Kathir also said in the book, &quot;Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami Amr ibn Uthman said on the authority of al-Makki: He said: &quot;I was walking with al-Hallaj in some streets of Makkah and I read the Qur&#x27;an. I was reciting, and he heard my recitation. And said: I can recite the same (recitation), so I left him&quot;. Narrated by Ibn Kathir, Abu Zari al-Tabari said, I heard Abu Ya&#x27;qub al-Aqta say: I gave my daughter in marriage to al-Husayn al-Hallaj when I saw his good conduct and diligence, and after a short time it became clear to me that He is a deceitful sorcerer, a hateful infidel. Ibn Kathir also said, &quot;Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Razi said: I heard Amr ibn Uthman cursing him and saying: If I could have killed him, I would have killed him with my own hands. I said to him: What did the Shaykh get on him? He Said: &quot;I read a verse of the Book of Allah and He said: I can compose like it and speak like it.&quot; Ibn Kathir also said, and Abu al-Qasim al-Qushayri mentioned in his letter in the chapter on preserving the hearts of the sheikhs: Amr bin Uthman entered the house of al-Hallaj when he was in Makkah, he (Hallaj) was writing something on paper and he (Amr) said to him : What is it? He (Hallaj) said: It is &quot;against the Qur&#x27;an&quot;. He said: Then he prayed for him and then he was not successful. Hallaj denied that Abu Ya&#x27;qub al-Aqta married him to his daughter.

== Works ==
Al-Hallaj&#x27;s principal works, all written in Arabic, included:

* Twenty-seven &quot;Riwāyāt&quot; (stories or narratives) collected by his disciples in about 290/902.
* &quot;Kitāb al-Tawāsīn&quot;, a series of eleven short works.
* Poems collected in &quot;Dīwān al-Hallāj&quot;.
* Pronouncements including those of his last night collected in &quot;Akhbār al-Hallāj&quot;.

His best known written work is the &quot;Book of al-Tawasin&quot; (), in which he used line diagrams and symbols to help him convey mystical experiences that he could not express in words. &quot;Ṭawāsīn&quot; is the broken plural of the word &quot;ṭā-sīn&quot; which spells out the letters ṭā (ط) and sīn (س) placed for unknown reasons at the start of some surahs in the Quran. The chapters vary in length and subject. Chapter 1 is an homage to Muhammad, for example, while Chapters 4 and 5 are treatments of his legendary ascent to Mi&#x27;raj. Chapter 6 is the longest of the chapters and is devoted to a dialogue of Satan (Iblis) and God, where Satan refuses to bow to Adam, although God asks him to do so. Satan&#x27;s monotheistic claim—that he refused to bow before any other than God even at the risk of eternal rejection and torment—is combined with the lyrical language of the love-mad lover from the Majnun tradition, the lover whose loyalty is so total that there is no path for him to any &quot;other than&quot; the beloved. This passage explores the issues of mystical knowledge (ma&#x27;rifa) when it contradicts God&#x27;s commands for although Iblis was disobeying God&#x27;s commands, he was following God&#x27;s will. His refusal is due, others argue, to a misconceived idea of God&#x27;s uniqueness and because of his refusal to abandon himself to God in love. Hallaj criticizes the staleness of his adoration (Mason, 51–3). Al-Hallaj stated in this book:

==Classical era views==

Few figures in Islam provoked as much debate among classical commentators as al-Hallaj. The controversy cut across doctrinal categories. In virtually every major current of juridical and theological thought (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i Hanbali, Maturidi, Ash&#x27;ari, and also Shia Jafari) one finds his detractors and others who accepted his legacy completely or justified his statements with some excuse. His admirers among philosophers included Ibn Tufayl, Suhrawardi, and Mulla Sadra.

Although the majority of early Sufi teachers condemned him, he was almost unanimously canonized by later generations of Sufis. The principal Sufi interpretation of the &quot;shathiyat&quot; which took the form of &quot;I am&quot; sayings contrasted the permanence (&quot;baqā&quot;) of God with the mystical annihilation (&quot;fanā&quot;) of the individual ego, which made it possible for God to speak through the individual. Some Sufi authors claimed that such utterances were misquotations or attributed them to immaturity, madness or intoxication, while others regarded them as authentic expressions of spiritual states, even profoundest experience of divine realities, which should not be manifested to the unworthy. Some of them, including al-Ghazali, showed ambivalence about their apparently blasphemous nature while admiring the spiritual status of their authors. Rumi wrote: &quot;When the pen (of authority) is in the hand of a traitor, unquestionably Mansur is on a gibbet&quot;

== Modern views ==
The supporters of Mansur have interpreted his statement as meaning, &quot;God has emptied me of everything but Himself. &quot; According to them, Mansur never denied God&#x27;s oneness and was a strict monotheist. However, he believed that the actions of man, when performed in total accordance with God&#x27;s pleasure, lead to a blissful unification with Him. Malayalam author Vaikom Muhammad Basheer draws parallel between &quot;Anā al-Ḥaqq&quot; and Aham Brahmasmi, the Upanishad Mahāvākya which means &#x27;I am Brahman&#x27; (the Ultimate Reality in Hinduism). Basheer uses this term to intend God is found within one&#x27;s &#x27;self&#x27;. There was a belief among European historians that al-Hallaj was secretly a Christian, until the French scholar Louis Massignon presented his legacy in the context of Islamic mysticism in his four-volume work &quot;La Passion de Husayn ibn Mansûr Hallâj&quot;.
== Influence ==
Hallaj highly influenced Adi ibn Musafir. Hallaj was revered in Adawiyya and later highly revered by Yezidis, who composed a few religious hymns devoted to him. Elements of his views expressed in &quot;Kitab al-Tawasin&quot; can be found in their religion.
