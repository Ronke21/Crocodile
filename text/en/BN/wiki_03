<text>James Gray, CStJ (born 7 November 1954) is a British politician who served as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for North Wiltshire from 1997 to 2024.

==Early life==
Born in Glasgow, Gray is the eldest son of Very Rev Dr John Rodger Gray, Minister of Dunblane Cathedral and the 1977 Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and Dr Sheila Mary Gray (née Whiteside), a GP.

Gray was educated at the Hillhead Primary School, Glasgow, and then the High School of Glasgow, a private school. He studied history at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with a Scottish Master of Arts first degree in 1975. He continued with post-graduate studies at Christ Church, Oxford, where he completed a history thesis in 1977.

==Early career==
From 1977, Gray worked as a graduate management trainee with P&amp;O for a year, also joining the Honourable Artillery Company, a unit of the Territorial Army based in Islington, where he served for seven years, becoming a graduate of the Royal College of Defence Studies with the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme. Gray was then engaged as a ship broker with Anderson Hughes before being admitted to the Freedom of the City of London in 1978, since when he has been a member of the Baltic Exchange. Managing director of GNI Freight Futures from 1984 until 1992, he was also a director of the Baltic Futures Exchange from 1989 to 1991. In 1987 he was awarded the Lloyd&#x27;s of London Book Prize.

===Entering politics===
PPC for Charles Kennedy&#x27;s seat of Ross, Cromarty and Skye at the 1992 general election, Gray was elected to the House of Commons for the North Wiltshire constituency in the 1997, becoming a Special Advisor to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Howard, and to his successor John Gummer. His particular responsibility was to the Ministers of State for Housing, Local Government and the Environment from 1992 until 1995, when he became a Director of the public affairs consultancy Westminster Strategy. Gray also served as governor of two schools in Balham and in the London Borough of Wandsworth. In 1994, he was elected as vice-chairman of Tooting Conservative Association, serving for two years.

==Member of Parliament==
=== 1997 – 2010 ===
At the 1997 general election, Gray was elected to the House of Commons as Member for the North Wiltshire constituency, following the retirement of the former Conservative Member, the Earl of Kilmorey. Gray won the seat with a majority of 3,475 and has been returned ever since.

Gray made his maiden speech on 11 June 1997, in which he spoke of his constituency&#x27;s largest town of Chippenham, and of his sadness at the massacre in his childhood home town of Dunblane.

His shadow ministerial career began with his appointment as a Conservative Whip in October 2000 and then as a Shadow Minister for Defence in 2001. He served as Shadow Minister for the Countryside from 2002 to 2005. After the 2005 general election, he served for just one week as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, as Peter Duncan had lost his seat. Gray resigned after stating that the Scottish Parliament should be abolished and replaced with Scottish MPs travelling to Edinburgh to conduct devolved business. He was replaced by Eleanor Laing, similarly a Scottish MP representing an English constituency.

Gray has served on a variety of Parliamentary select committees He sat on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee from 1997 to 2001. He served from 2001 to 2003 on the Broadcasting Committee. He was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee for the 2005 Parliament, and Chairman of the Conservative Rural Action Group (2002–2005).

Gray founded the All Party Group for the Army in 2004 and was the sitting MP on David Cameron&#x27;s policy group for National and International Security, chaired by Dame Pauline Neville-Jones (2006–07). The Group published their report, An Unquiet World in July 2007.

In March 2009, Gray was a member of a cross-party parliamentary delegation to Afghanistan to learn about British Army operations there. During the visit, British service personnel demonstrated the process by which wounded soldiers are flown into Kandahar on a Hercules and transferred across the runway to a C-17 equipped with the latest medical equipment, and were photographed with medical staff on board. Gray denied allegations that he had taken photographs of a &quot;dying soldier&quot; posted on the blog of Iain Dale, stating that after a reminder to delete any images including injured servicemen, he had checked his camera and found none. According to Gray it was night time and the delegation was kept 500 yards away from the injured soldiers. Following the publication of two articles in &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the incident was investigated by the Press Complaints Commission and Gray&#x27;s complaints were upheld.

=== 2010 – 2024 ===
At the 2024 General Election, Gray stood in the newly created constituency of South Cotswolds: he was defeated by a margin of 4,973 votes to the Liberal Democrat candidate, Roz Savage.

At the 2010 General Election, Gray had stood in the constituency of North Wiltshire: he won by a majority of 7,483 votes, winning 25,114 votes and securing 51.6% of the 48,699 who voted. The number of votes he received had risen by 1.9% since the last election, whilst support for the Labour Party had fallen by 5.3% in his constituency.

In the 2010 Parliament he sat on the Procedure Committee, Panel of Chairs and until 2013 the Finance and Services Committee. From 2013 onwards he sat on the Defence Committee and Committees on Arms Export Controls. In May 2014 he was one of seven unsuccessful candidates for the chairmanship of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee.

In the previous parliament he served as the Chairman of the All-Party Group for Multiple Sclerosis. He was Treasurer of the APPG for Suicide Prevention, a vice-chairman of the APPG on Agriculture and Food for Development and a founder and member of the APPGs for Historic Churches and Dairy Farmers. He was also a member of the all-party groups for Financial Markets and Services, Middle Way (hunting and animal welfare), Minerals, Racing and Bloodstock Industries and Solvent Abuse. Gray&#x27;s stated countries of interest are America, China, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Russia.

Gray has signed several early day motions, sponsored by Conservative MP David Tredinnick, in support of the continued funding of homeopathy on the NHS.

Gray campaigned against the closure of RAF Lyneham. In January, he hosted a special 1½ hour Westminster Hall debate on the subject of &#x27;The RAF Air Transport Fleet and RAF Lyneham&#x27;. Following the debate, Gray published a dossier on a number of significant changes in the Air Transport Fleet which should, according to Gray, result in the decision to close RAF Lyneham being reversed.

In a House of Commons debate on 9 December 2010, Thomas Docherty, the Labour Member of Parliament for Dunfermline and West Fife accused Gray of directing a &quot;racist remark&quot; towards Willie Bain. Gray was alleged to have told McBain to &quot;get back to Jockland&quot;. Gray responded: &quot;I cannot imagine what sedentary remark the hon. Gentleman may have heard, but I am certain that had it been out of order in any shape, size or form, Mr Speaker, who was then in the chair, would have picked me up on it. Further to that, as a Scot born, bred and educated, who never left the borders of Scotland until the age of 21, I think that unlike [Thomas Docherty], I have the highest respect and love for my native heath. I would never say a single word against it.&quot;

In March 2019, Gray was one of 21 MPs who voted against LGBT inclusive sex and relationship education in English schools. A keen Brexit supporter, he was an advocate for pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave.

In September 2021, he issued an apology after joking that a bomb should be delivered to the office of Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds. Gray said: &quot;It was a foolish remark. I meant no offence and hope none was taken.&quot; In October 2021, he was criticised after confusing Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi and Health Secretary Sajid Javid at a reception in Parliament, allegedly saying &quot;they all look the same to me.&quot; Gray acknowledged that he mixed up the names of the two ministers but denied saying &quot;they all look the same to me&quot;.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Gray contested the new South Cotswolds constituency but was defeated by Liberal Democrat Roz Savage.

=== Expenses ===
In May 2009, Gray&#x27;s expenses were highlighted in the media when he was accused of claiming for Remembrance Day wreaths. It was claimed that his action had angered Forces charity groups. It was reported that Gray then complained to the Leader of the House of Commons when he was told that Remembrance Day wreaths were not a legitimate expense. These claims were denied by Gray who argued that Military and Council representatives do not pay for wreaths out of their own pockets. Details of Gray&#x27;s expenses, published by House of Commons Authorities, show that he was never reimbursed for the cost of Remembrance Sunday wreaths.
Gray was later criticised for claiming £2,000 decorating fees for a second home on the day he moved out. Gray organised three special surgeries in Corsham, Wootton Bassett and Malmesbury to answer any questions from his constituents regarding his expenses.

==Personal life==
Gray married Sarah Ann Beale in 1980, and they have two sons and a daughter. The marriage ended in 2006, after it emerged that Gray was having an affair with a married woman, Philippa Mayo, while his wife was fighting breast cancer. Gray had met Philippa Mayo, then Director of the Countryside Alliance&#x27;s pro-hunting campaign, while organising Conservative opposition to the anti-hunting bill. The affair attracted national press attention when Mayo&#x27;s husband, the barrister Rupert Mayo, wrote to a local newspaper, the &quot;Wiltshire Gazette and Herald&quot;, &quot;The irony is that I will not reap the benefits of Mr Cameron&#x27;s excellent family-based policy proposals because one of his own MPs has ripped my own family apart.&quot; The local Conservative Association subsequently considered deselecting Gray as their parliamentary candidate, but in January 2007, after a secret ballot of all local party members, decided to confirm him as the Conservative candidate for North Wiltshire.
==Honours and decorations==
In August 2020, Gray was one of 11 appointments as Commander of the Order of St John: Gray said he looked forward to supporting the Order, in particular St John Ambulance.

<doc id="427337" wikidata="Q337453" url="?curid=427337" title="Chris Grayling">
<text>Christopher Stephen Grayling, Baron Grayling, (born 1 April 1962), is a British politician and author who served as Secretary of State for Justice from 2012 to 2015, Leader of the House of Commons from 2015 to 2016 and Secretary of State for Transport from 2016 until 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Epsom and Ewell from 2001 to 2024. Before entering politics, Grayling worked in the television and film industry.

Grayling was born in London and studied history at Cambridge University. He wrote a number of books as well as working for the BBC and Channel 4 before going into politics. A member of the Social Democratic Party until 1988, he then joined the Conservatives. First elected to Parliament in the 2001 general election for Epsom and Ewell, he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron in 2005 as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. In 2007, he became the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and in 2009 he was appointed Shadow Home Secretary.

Following the 2010 general election and the formation of the Cameron–Clegg coalition, Grayling was made Minister of State for Employment. In September 2012, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice and served until 2015. He was the first non-lawyer to have served as Lord Chancellor for at least 440 years. He was Leader of the House of Commons and the Lord President of the Council from 2015 to 2016. In the majority and minority May governments, Grayling served as Secretary of State for Transport.

Grayling stood down from the Cabinet when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019. Johnson hoped for Grayling to become Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee by being voted in by the Conservative majority on the committee. However, fellow Conservative Julian Lewis defeated Grayling in the ballot by using opposition votes to secure a majority, in what was seen as a blow to Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings. Six weeks later, Grayling resigned from the committee apparently due to his failure to become chair. He stood down at the 2024 general election and was appointed to the House of Lords.

==Early life and career==
Grayling was born in London and grew up in Buckinghamshire, where he was educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. He then went to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an upper-second class Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1984.

Grayling joined BBC News in 1985 as a trainee, becoming a producer in 1986. He left the BBC in 1988 to join Channel 4 as an editor on its &quot;Business Daily&quot; television programme. He rejoined the BBC in 1991 as a business development manager on BBC Select. On leaving the BBC again in 1993, he briefly joined Charterhouse Productions as managing director before leaving several months later as it was wound up for failing to pay VAT. He ran several television production companies from late 1993, including managing the corporate communications division of Workhouse Ltd from 1992 to 1995 and SSVC Group in Gerrards Cross from 1995 to 1997.

Grayling became a public relations consultant in 1997 with Burson Marsteller, where he remained until his election to Parliament. Prior to joining the Conservative Party, Grayling was a member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).

==Early political career==
===Borough councillor: 1998–2002===
Grayling was selected to contest the Labour-held marginal seat of Warrington South at the 1997 general election, but was defeated by Labour candidate Helen Southworth by 10,807 votes. He was elected as a councillor for the Hillside ward in the London Borough of Merton in 1998 and remained on the council until 2002.

===Elected Member of Parliament: 2001===
Grayling was elected to the House of Commons to represent the Surrey seat of Epsom and Ewell at the 2001 general election following the retirement of the veteran Tory MP Archie Hamilton. Grayling held the seat with a majority of 10,080 and has been returned as MP there since. He made his maiden speech on 25 June 2001.
In 2019, Grayling announced that Stoneleigh train station was to be given step-free access.

===Shadow Cabinet: 2001–2010===

Grayling served on the Environment, Transport and the Regions Select committee from 2001 until he was promoted to the Opposition Whips&#x27; Office by Iain Duncan Smith in 2002, moving to become a Spokesman for Health later in the year. He became a Spokesman for Education and Skills by Michael Howard in 2003.

Following the 2005 general election, he became a member of Howard&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons and, after the election of David Cameron as the leader of the Conservative Party, in December 2005, he served as the Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. In June 2007, he was made Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, a post he held until January 2009 when he became Shadow Home Secretary.

Grayling became known as a national politician through his &quot;attack dog&quot; pressure on leading Labour politicians. He was heavily involved in the questioning of David Blunkett, the then Work and Pensions Secretary, over his business affairs, which led to Blunkett&#x27;s resignation in 2005.

Grayling challenged Tony Blair and his wife Cherie over the money they made from lectures while Blair was Prime Minister. He also challenged minister Stephen Byers over his handling of the Railtrack collapse.

====Role in the expenses scandal====
Between 2001 and 2009, Grayling claimed expenses for his flat in Pimlico, close to the Houses of Parliament, despite having a constituency home no further than 17 miles away. Grayling said he uses the flat when &quot;working very late&quot; because he needs to &quot;work very erratic and late hours most days when the House of Commons is sitting.&quot; During the Parliamentary expenses scandal, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Grayling refitted and redecorated the flat in 2005 costing over £5,000. Grayling&#x27;s expenses issue was seen as embarrassing for the Conservative Party as he had previously criticised Labour ministers for being implicated in sleaze scandals.

In 2010, it was reported by &quot;the Daily Telegraph&quot; that an IP address associated with the Parliamentary estate had been discovered attempting to remove references to Chris Grayling&#x27;s role in the expenses scandal from his Wikipedia page. They attempted the edit to remove the information 5 times and later received a warning from a Wikipedia administrator.

====Comparing Moss Side to &quot;The Wire&quot;====
As Shadow Home Secretary, Grayling provoked controversy in August 2009 when he compared Manchester&#x27;s Moss Side area to the American TV crime drama &quot;The Wire&quot;. His comments received an angry response from some Manchester locals and criticism from the police. Having been out on patrol for a day with the police, observing the results of a shooting at a house, he described himself as having witnessed an &quot;urban war&quot;. Police responded that gang-related shootings in Greater Manchester had fallen by 82 per cent from the previous year and that to speak of &quot;urban war&quot; was &quot;sensationalistic&quot;.

A local councillor, Roy Walters, complained of Moss Side unfairly being a &quot;negative target&quot; due to historical associations. Defending his comments, Grayling said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t say Moss Side equals Baltimore. What I said is that we have in Moss Side symptoms of a gang conflict in this country which I find profoundly disturbing.&quot; Baltimore, with a population of about 600,000, was noted as having 191 gun related murders in the previous year, in comparison to Moss Side, population 17,537, which had none.

====Statistics on violent crime====
Grayling came under criticism as Shadow Home Secretary over the Conservative Party&#x27;s use of statistics on violent crime. In February 2010, the Conservative Party issued press releases to every constituency in the UK claiming that crime had &quot;risen sharply&quot; in the UK. They failed, however, to take into account the more rigorous system for recording crime. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Michael Scholar, said that the figures Grayling was using were &quot;likely to mislead the public&quot; and &quot;likely to damage public trust in official statistics&quot; as the way in which crime was calculated had been changed in 2002.

A Conservative-commissioned report by the independent House of Commons library suggested that, depending on how figures were calculated, Grayling&#x27;s claims may have been justifiable and that violent crime may have risen in the period between 1998 and 2009. The incumbent Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, called Grayling&#x27;s use of crime statistics &quot;dodgy&quot; and said that the British Crime Survey clearly showed that violent crime had reduced by 41% over the same period.

====Gay couples in B&amp;Bs====
In March 2010, Grayling was recorded at an open meeting of the Centre for Policy Studies think tank saying that during the debates on civil liberties under the Labour Government, he had felt that Christians should have the right to live by their consciences and that Christian owners of bed and breakfasts should have the right to turn away gay couples. Grayling said:
&quot;I personally always took the view that, if you look at the case of should a Christian hotel owner have the right to exclude a gay couple from a hotel, I took the view that if it&#x27;s a question of somebody who&#x27;s doing a B&amp;B in their own home, that individual should have the right to decide who does and who doesn&#x27;t come into their own home. If they are running a hotel on the high street, I really don&#x27;t think that it is right in this day and age that a gay couple should walk into a hotel and be turned away because they are a gay couple, and I think that is where the dividing line comes.&quot;
When the recording was released by &quot;The Observer&quot;, on 3 April 2010, Grayling&#x27;s comments caused an angry response from gay rights campaigners, with Ben Summerskill, Chief Executive of the gay rights group Stonewall, saying that this position would be &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;very alarming to a lot of gay people who may have been thinking of voting Conservative&quot;. Lord Mandelson, the most senior gay minister in the (then Labour) Government, added that the comment showed that the Conservative Party had not changed, that &quot;when the camera is on they say one thing, but when the camera is off they say another&quot;. Conservative Party leader David Cameron was subsequently urged to &quot;back or sack&quot; Grayling, with gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell saying that &quot;Cameron&#x27;s silence is worrying. Many voters – gay and straight – will be disturbed by his failure to swiftly disown Grayling&#x27;s support for homophobic discrimination. What does this say about the sincerity and seriousness of his commitment to gay equality?&quot;

Anastasia Beaumont-Bott, founder of LGBTory, a gay rights group which campaigns for the Conservatives, announced that she would be voting for Labour, not the Conservatives, in response to Grayling&#x27;s comments. She said, &quot;I feel guilty because as a gay woman affected by LGBT rights I am on record saying you should vote Conservative, and I want to reverse that. I want to go on record to say don&#x27;t vote Conservative. I&#x27;d go as far to say that I&#x27;ll vote Labour at this general election.&quot; Beaumont-Bott was joined in defecting from the Conservatives to Labour a week later by gay rights campaigner David Heathcote. Grayling&#x27;s comments were defended by a number of commentators, including the &quot;Today Programme&quot; presenter and gay broadcaster Evan Davis and leading Christian groups.

Grayling apologised on 9 April 2010, saying: &quot;I am sorry if what I said gave the wrong impression, I certainly didn&#x27;t intend to offend anyone... I voted for gay rights, I voted for this particular measure.&quot; Various commentators speculated that he might have been &quot;hidden away&quot; by his party when he made relatively few public appearances in the days of the general election campaign that followed. It is unclear whether his remarks were the reason that David Cameron chose to appoint Theresa May as Home Secretary in his new Cabinet, rather than Grayling who held the position in the Shadow Cabinet; Grayling was not given any Cabinet post, as had been predicted by some media commentators prior to the election. On 31 January 2013, it was reported that Grayling would vote in favour of same-sex marriage in England and Wales.

==Early ministerial career==

On 13 May 2010, Grayling was appointed Minister of State for Employment and was sworn into the Privy Council on 28 May. As minister at DWP he was responsible for jobcentres. Measures were introduced to reduce costs, leaving 100,000 staff redundant in offices around the country. In the context of a &quot;Broken Society&quot; he accused some families of being habitually unemployed, generation after generation, living in sink council estates in the inner cities. In the October 2010 Spending Review, the government made cuts to the DWP budget in order to constrain welfare spending.

The policy later informed treatment of prisoners, refusing the right to vote, and clamping down on abusive behaviours in jails. He announced work programmes for prisoners, encouraged an end to the &quot;something for nothing culture&quot;. More people than ever were found fit to work as part of a package of measures in a £5 billion program to make work for the long-term unemployed.

==Cabinet-level minister==
Grayling was promoted to the Cabinet on 4 September 2012, as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. Sworn in as Lord Chancellor on 1 October 2012 at Westminster Abbey, he was elected an Honorary Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn on 11 December 2012, due in part to his lack of legal qualifications. He was the first non-lawyer to have served as Lord Chancellor for at least 440 years. (It was reported that the last such non-lawyer was the Earl of Shaftesbury in 1672–73; but the Earl was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1638.)

Grayling&#x27;s appointment was widely seen as a return to a more hard line approach than that of his predecessor, Clarke. Grayling pursued a &quot;tough justice&quot; agenda, including ending automatic early release for terrorists and child rapists, ending simple cautions for serious offences, and introducing greater protections for householders who defend themselves against intruders. The leading human rights barrister Lord Pannick described Grayling&#x27;s performance as &quot;notable only for his attempts to restrict judicial reviews and human rights, his failure to protect the judiciary against criticism from his colleagues and the reduction of legal aid to a bare minimum.&quot;

=== Prisoner reforms ===
One of Grayling&#x27;s first acts at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was to commence a project to change the way offenders were rehabilitated in an effort to cut reoffending rates. Under a system of &quot;payment by results&quot;, private companies as well as charities were to play a greater role in looking after offenders on licence in the community.

Grayling&#x27;s ban on books being sent into UK prisons was widely criticised by the Howard League for Penal Reform and the literary establishment, including Philip Pullman, Mark Haddon, Anthony Horowitz, Susan Hill and Emma Donoghue. The ban was described as obscene by Shaun Attwood of the TV show &quot;Banged Up Abroad&quot; who read over a thousand books in prison and credited books for being the lifeblood of rehabilitation.
The move was defended as being not about a ban on books being sent into prison, but about parcels being sent in, as giving prisons access to the latter would almost certainly increase the amount of contraband getting into the prison estate. The High Court ruled the ban illegal in December 2015.

On stepping down from his role as Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Harding criticised Grayling for &quot;robustly&quot; interfering with the contents of reports and Grayling&#x27;s department for using financial controls to influence what was inspected, thereby threatening the independence of the Inspector&#x27;s role.

In March 2019, the UK National Audit Office issued a report on the reforms of the probation system in England and Wales initiated by Grayling during his tenure at the MoJ stating that the Ministry had &quot;set itself up to fail&quot; through the &quot;rushed implementation&quot; of the reforms. As a result, the MoJ&#x27;s aim of delivering cuts in reoffending had not been achieved, with reoffending rates having &quot;increased significantly&quot;, at a cost £467 million higher than predicted. However, a report released in January 2020 by the MoJ stated that due to the reforms introduced by Grayling, adult and juvenile reoffending rates decreased substantially.

In May 2019, incumbent Justice Secretary, David Gauke, announced offender supervision in England and Wales is to be returned to government control, under the management of the National Probation Service, reversing Grayling&#x27;s policy. The abolition of Grayling&#x27;s &#x27;payment by results&#x27; system took place in December 2020, terminating the contracts of the private sector providers two years early. During the 2017–18 period &#x27;serious further offences&#x27;, which include crimes such as murder and rape had increased by 21% compared to the 2016–17 period in June 2019, a study published by the British Sociological Association described the privatisation of the probation system as an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot; and found that it left the public at greater risk from ex-offenders released from prison.

=== Prison benchmarking and staff cuts ===
A prison &quot;benchmarking&quot; programme was introduced in 2012 by Grayling to reduce the costs of public sector prisons to match comparable private sector prisons, along with associated new core standards intended to result in prisoners having similar amounts of time spent outside their cells across similar prisons. Prison officer numbers were reduced from about 23,000 in 2012 to about 18,000 in 2015.

In 2015, the Justice Select Committee, following a year-long prison inquiry, was critical of Justice ministers for apparent complacency about a 38% rise in prison deaths since 2012. The committee concluded that efficiency savings and staffing shortages had made &quot;a significant contribution to the deterioration in safety&quot; in prisons. The committee commended Grayling for his goal of creating a nationwide network of resettlement prisons. A pioneering scheme to help inmates rehabilitate in the community where they are released.

=== A &#x27;tough justice&#x27; agenda: court reforms ===
Grayling&#x27;s proposed cuts to legal aid were widely criticised by the legal profession. In May 2013, 90 Queen&#x27;s Counsels signed a letter sent to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that branded the cuts &quot;unjust&quot;, as they would seriously undermine the rule of law. 6 January 2014 saw the first strike in British history by barristers and solicitors in protest at the cuts. In February 2014, he introduced the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 to the House of Commons. The Bill included measures to outlaw &quot;revenge porn&quot;. In October 2014, Grayling unveiled the Conservative Party&#x27;s proposals for reforms to human rights in order to curb the European Court of Human Rights&#x27; influence over British court rulings, whilst honouring the text of the original Convention on Human Rights in a British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.

In December 2013, Alan Turing was granted a pardon by the Queen, after a process initiated by Grayling in his capacity as Lord Chancellor. In April 2015, Grayling introduced mandatory flat-fee court charges for magistrates&#x27; courts, the lowest fee being £150 for a guilty plea. Lawyers feared that defendants may plead guilty to avoid falling into debt, and the president of the Law Society described the change as a threat to fair trials. The charges for the Crown Court were increased to £1,200.

=== Justice department security failure ===
In January 2015, data relating to three fatal police shootings including details of marksmen and the deceased&#x27;s family were lost in the post by the Justice Department. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; it was particularly embarrassing for Grayling as the government was claiming it needed to access personal data to deal with terrorism and could keep it securely. The data included details of the Mark Duggan shooting incident which had triggered the 2011 England riots.

=== Fathers 4 Justice protests ===
On multiple occasions in 2014 and 2015, Fathers 4 Justice protesters targeted Grayling&#x27;s constituency home in Ashtead, Surrey in January and October 2015. Other incidents included a weekend protest camp set up outside his house by four protesters.

===Leader of the House of Commons===

After the 2015 general election, Grayling was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council. Michael Gove replaced Grayling as Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor.

Grayling led Theresa May&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the Conservative Party, and thus also as successor to David Cameron as Prime Minister, following Cameron&#x27;s resignation in June 2016. May won the contest by default following the withdrawal of the only other contender, Andrea Leadsom, after the second round of the leadership ballot.

== Secretary of State for Transport ==
Grayling was appointed as Secretary of State for Transport when Theresa May became Prime Minister in July 2016. He became criticised for various gaffes and controversies, such as injuring a cyclist by unsafely opening the door of his ministerial car in October 2016 and misspending £2.7 billion of public funds over his tenure as Transport Secretary. Because of such reports, he became known by the moniker &quot;Failing Grayling&quot; used by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, opposition MPs and allegedly his own Cabinet colleagues.

=== London metro services: December 2016 ===
In December 2016, Grayling blocked a move by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan to give control of the metro services run by Southeastern to Transport for London. A leaked 2013 letter revealed Grayling had previously written to then-London mayor Boris Johnson saying he opposed such a move because it could put those services &quot;in the clutches of a Labour mayor&quot;. The leak led to Grayling being accused of putting his party&#x27;s political interests over those of the public and commuters, as well as members of his own party calling for his resignation.

=== Railway electrification cancellations: 2017–2018 ===

On the last day before parliament closed for its summer recess in 2017, Grayling acknowledged that he had cancelled multiple railway electrification schemes in the north of England that had been promised by David Cameron and George Osborne. In January 2018, Grayling was criticised by railway passengers and by Transport Select Committee members for his decision. In March 2018, it emerged that National Audit Office records showed Grayling to have made the decision several months earlier in 2017 than previously acknowledged, but had suppressed the decision during the 2017 United Kingdom general election and for the remainder of the parliamentary session.

=== Railway timetable change and vote of no confidence: May–June 2018 ===
In summer 2018, problems introducing a new timetable caused widespread disruption and the cancellation of 10% of trains on Northern and Thameslink. The Chief Executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, Charles Horton, resigned, and Grayling faced a vote of confidence in the House of Commons on 19 June 2018, with the resulting division 305–285 in Grayling&#x27;s favour. Govia Thameslink did not need to pay performance penalties for this disruption after an agreement made in 2017.

=== Gatwick Airport drone incident: December 2018 ===
Following the December 2018 Gatwick Airport drone incident, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Grayling had ignored &quot;numerous warnings&quot; about the threat posed by drones, halting draft legislation due for publication in early 2019 thereby allowing civil servants to be diverted to Brexit related tasks. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the RAF offered the assistance of a specialist anti-drone team almost immediately but Grayling&#x27;s department – which would have had to pay for the service – was reluctant to accept.

=== Seaborne Freight: 2018–2019 ===
On 29 December 2018, it emerged that Grayling&#x27;s department had awarded £46.6m to French firm Brittany Ferries, £42.5m to Danish shipping firm DFDS, and £13.8m to British firm Seaborne Freight, to provide additional cross-channel freight capacity in case of a &quot;no-deal&quot; Brexit on 29 March 2019. On 2 January 2019, it was reported that Seaborne Freight had never run a ferry service and owned no ships. The Road Haulage Association said the firm had an impossible timescale in which to &quot;source ferries, hire and train staff and link with relevant authorities&quot;. Despite Grayling&#x27;s assurance that the usual procurement due diligence procedures had been followed, it was later revealed that Seaborne Freight issued terms and conditions designed for a food delivery business, not ferries; that its chief executive previously ran a ship chartering business that was forced into liquidation following court petitions from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC); and that auditors performing the due diligence checks had reported serious concerns about the contract. In relation to the prior court action by HMRC against Seaborne Freight&#x27;s chief executive, the amount of unpaid tax was not reported, but the former company had a total of £1.78 million in unpaid debts.

Grayling&#x27;s unilateral decision to use Ostend, instead of Calais, as the continental terminal for some ferry services, was not appreciated in Calais, whose port chairman told Grayling he was no longer welcome there.

Seaborne Freight&#x27;s contract was cancelled on 8 February 2019 by Grayling&#x27;s department after the Irish firm, Arklow Shipping, which was secretly intended to run the contract decided to pull out. The collapse of the contract led to calls from both sides of parliament for Grayling&#x27;s dismissal. On 13 February 2019, Grayling&#x27;s department said that, following the collapse of the Seaborne Freight contract, it had &quot;run out of time&quot; to secure the substantial additional cross-channel transport capacity that could be needed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel Tunnel, initiated legal action against the Department for Transport, claiming that the awarding of ferry contracts for the event of a no-deal Brexit had been &quot;secretive and flawed&quot;, and that Eurotunnel, which also operates freight services across the English Channel, had not had the opportunity to compete. The matter was settled out of court, with Eurotunnel receiving £33 million as part of a deal in which the company will provide freight services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This caused renewed calls for Grayling&#x27;s dismissal.

On 16 March 2019, it emerged that the ferry companies engaged by Grayling would receive an additional £28m in the event of Brexit being delayed beyond 29 March 2019, which it was.

===Delays and cost overruns to introduction of Class 800 trains===
In March 2019, Lord Adonis, former Labour transport minister, was critical of the delay in implementing services on the East Coast Mainline, using Class 800 trains. The trains were ordered ten years before services commenced. Delays were caused when it was found the trains interfered with trackside signalling equipment. Adonis said, &quot;They had 10 years to get these signalling issues right.&quot; Similar trains, introduced by Great Western Railway had cost twice the estimated amount. Grayling said, &quot;These new state-of-the-art trains show our commitment to put passengers at the heart of everything that we do and will carry people across Britain, from Swansea to Aberdeen and London to Inverness.&quot; The service, planned to run to Swansea, has only so far reached Cardiff. Grayling travelled on the first Class 800 train, operated by Great Western Railway. It set off 25 minutes late, arrived 41 minutes late, and had no air-conditioning when it arrived. The air conditioning was switched off after it leaked liquid into the carriages. Grayling declined to travel on the first Class 800 to run on the East Coast Main Line.

==Post-ministerial career==
Boris Johnson reportedly hoped for Grayling to be voted in as Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee by the narrow Conservative majority sitting on the committee. The possible appointment prompted criticism from fellow Conservative MPs, acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey and Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith, who said his appointment would &quot;make a mockery&quot; of the committee. There were fears it would be a &quot;power grab&quot; by Johnson and his senior adviser Dominic Cummings designed to avoid accountability over their links to Russia outlined in a suppressed report. On 15 July 2020, opposition committee members voted for independently minded Conservative Julian Lewis as chair which, together with his vote, secured a majority for him.

In May 2020, Grayling alongside Mark Cecil were appointed trustees of the National Portrait Gallery by Johnson. Both were reappointed as trustees by prime minister Rishi Sunak in December 2023 for another four year term.

After Grayling&#x27;s failure to be elected as Intelligence and Security Committee chair, he was criticised by colleagues who referred back to his previous track record as a minister, and who &quot;The Spectator&quot; reported as saying &quot;only Grayling could lose a rigged election&quot;. Julian Lewis had the party whip withdrawn by Boris Johnson. On 21 July 2020, the committee released the previously repressed report which outlined how the government had failed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 EU referendum. On 28 August, it was reported Grayling had resigned from the committee. &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that sources familiar with the matter had indicated he had &quot;gone off in a sulk&quot; and had no desire to serve on the committee as an ordinary member.

On 17 September 2020, it was announced that Grayling had been appointed to a £100,000-per-annum 7-hour-per-week job advising the British Virgin Islands-domiciled Hutchison Port Holdings Limited &quot;on its environmental strategy and its engagement with local enterprise bodies&quot;.

In October 2023, Grayling announced he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and would therefore not seek re-election at the 2024 general election. He said: &quot;Earlier this year I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and although the treatment has been successful, it has prompted me to think that after 22 years it is time for a change&quot;. In March 2024, he appealed to South Western Railway to increase train services in his constituency during morning rush hours due to most trains being full. In May 2024, the Conservative Environment Network awarded Grayling the annual Sam Barker Memorial Prize for his efforts to reduce deforestation and maintain British wildlife habitats.

===Peerage===
After standing down as an MP, Grayling was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. He was created &quot;Baron Grayling, of Ashtead in the County of Surrey&quot;, on 20 August 2024.

== Personal life ==
Grayling is married to Susan Dillistone and they have two children. , he lives in Ashtead.

<text>John Robert Greenway (born 15 February 1946) is a former British politician who sat as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Ryedale from 1987 until the constituency&#x27;s abolition in 2010.

==Early life==
John Greenway was born in Northwich, Cheshire and was educated locally at the Sir John Deane&#x27;s Grammar School and The College of Law, London. He joined Midland Bank in 1964 before joining the Metropolitan Police Service in 1965, after his Hendon Police College training he worked in the West End of London, leaving the force in 1969 to sell life insurance for Equitable Life. He joined National Provident in 1970, before setting up his own insurance and finance company in 1971. He was a financial journalist at &quot;Post Magazine&quot; (Post Weekly), and still writes for financial publications.

==Parliamentary career==
He was the treasurer of the Ryedale Conservative Association for two years from 1984 and was elected to the North Yorkshire County Council in 1985 for two years. He was the vice-chairman of the North Yorkshire Police 1986–7. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1987 general election, when he regained the seat for the Conservatives from the Liberal MP Elizabeth Shields who won the seat at the 1986 Ryedale by-election. Greenway won the seat with a majority of 9,740 and remained the MP until the seat&#x27;s abolition for the 2010 general election.

He served in parliament as a member of the home affairs select committee 1987–97, and was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Jean Trumpington for a year from 1991. He was promoted to the frontbench by William Hague in 1997 as a spokesman on home affairs, before being moved in 2000 as a spokesman for culture, media and sport where he remained throughout the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith until he was sacked by Michael Howard in 2003. He was briefly a member of the education and skills select committee in 2005 before the general election. He was the chairman of the all party opera group. He introduced the Bill for the Ragwort Control Act 2003.

He maintained a strong interest in the financial services sector and chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Insurance and Financial Services.

In boundary changes agreed in 2006, Greenway&#x27;s constituency was enlarged and renamed Thirsk and Malton, taking in a large part of the divided Vale of York constituency. Unexpectedly on 18 November 2006, the Thirsk and Malton Conservative Association selected Anne McIntosh (sitting MP for Vale of York) over Greenway as their candidate for the next general election.

He was criticised in some quarters for his poor attendance record in the House of Commons. According to the theyworkforyou website, he attended only half of Parliamentary votes, and contributed to very few debates. In the scandal concerning MP&#x27;s expenses it was alleged Mr. Greenway claimed £500 for petunias and fuchsia for his London flat. 

==Personal life==
He was married to Sylvia Ann Gant in 1974. They have two sons and a daughter. He now lives in Chiswick with divorcee Hanneke Dannhorn (born 1953), mother of Emily and Mark Dannhorn, and managing director of the Brook Green UK travel group, since 2004.

A horse racing enthusiast, he won an animal welfare award in 2003, and is the president of York City F.C. As a former police officer he has called for the death penalty for police murders, specifically mentioning Winston Silcott, after narrowly avoiding being shot. Greenway fought for an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to provide for capital punishment for the murder of a police officer. He later tried to sponsor a similar bill commanding that &quot;A person aged 18 years or above who is convicted of the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty shall on conviction be sentenced to death.&quot; Both attempts were soundly defeated.

<text>Dominic Charles Roberts Grieve (born 24 May 1956) is a British barrister and former politician who served as Shadow Home Secretary from 2008 to 2009 and Attorney General for England and Wales from 2010 to 2014. He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Beaconsfield from 1997 to 2019 and was the Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee from 2015 to 2019.

Grieve attended the Cabinet as Attorney General for England and Wales and Advocate General for Northern Ireland from May 2010 to July 2014. He was dismissed as Attorney General by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of the 2014 Cabinet reshuffle, and was replaced by Jeremy Wright. Elected as a Conservative, Grieve had the Conservative whip removed in the September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs. He unsuccessfully stood as an independent candidate in Beaconsfield at the 2019 general election.

A liberal conservative, Grieve was a central figure on Brexit and frequently used his experience as a lawyer to propose amendments on the issue, with his interventions often being at odds with government policy. A prominent Remain supporter on Brexit, Grieve called for a second referendum on EU membership, and before being expelled had said that he and other Conservative rebels would support a vote of no confidence to bring down a Conservative government, if that were the only way to block the &quot;catastrophic&quot; damage from a bad Brexit. In spring 2019, Grieve was threatened with deselection by his local party after losing a confidence vote by members. In October 2019, following removal of the whip, Grieve announced that he would stand as an independent candidate in his constituency&#x27;s seat at the next general election. It was announced that the Liberal Democrats would stand aside to help him, but to no avail, as he lost his seat.

Grieve is the president of the Franco-British Society. He was awarded the Legion of Honour in 2016, and broadcasts in French on French radio and television. He is a practising Anglican and was a member of the London diocesan synod of the Church of England. Grieve is also a member of the Garrick Club.

==Early life==
Grieve was born in Lambeth, London, the son of Percy Grieve, QC (the MP for Solihull 1964–83), and of an Anglo-French mother, Evelyn Raymonde Louise Mijouain (d. 1991), maternal granddaughter of Sir George Roberts, 1st and last baronet. He was educated at the Lycée français Charles de Gaulle on Cromwell Road in South Kensington, Colet Court (an all-boys&#x27; preparatory school in Barnes) and Westminster School. He went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Modern History in 1978. He was the President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1977.

Grieve continued his studies at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster), where he received a Diploma in Law in 1979.

==Legal career==
He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1980 and is a specialist in occupational safety and health law.

==Political career==
===Local council===
He was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham for the Avonmore ward in 1982, but did not stand for re-election in 1986. He contested the Norwood constituency in the London Borough of Lambeth at the 1987 general election but finished in second place behind the veteran Labour MP John Fraser.

===Member of Parliament===

He was elected to the House of Commons for the Buckinghamshire seat of Beaconsfield at the 1997 general election following the resignation of Tim Smith in the cash-for-questions affair. Grieve was elected with a majority of 13,987 votes and remained the MP there until his defeat in the 2019 general election.

He made his maiden speech on 21 May 1997.

He was a member of both the Environmental Audit and the Statutory Instruments select committees from 1997 to 1999. In 1999, he was promoted to the frontbench by William Hague as a spokesman on Scottish affairs, moving to speak on home affairs as the spokesman on criminal justice following the election of Iain Duncan Smith as the new leader of the Conservative Party in 2001, and was then promoted to be shadow Attorney General by Michael Howard in 2003. Grieve also had responsibility for community cohesion on behalf of the Conservative Party. He voted for the Iraq War in 2003.

He was retained as Shadow Attorney General by the new Conservative Leader David Cameron, and was appointed Shadow Home Secretary on 12 June 2008, following the resignation of David Davis.

In early 2006, Grieve was instrumental in the defeat of the Labour government on its proposal that the Home Secretary should have power to detain suspected terrorists for periods up to 90 days without charge.

In the last Conservative Shadow Cabinet reshuffle before the general election of 2010, carried out on 19 January 2009, Grieve was moved to become Shadow Justice Secretary, opposite Jack Straw. According to the BBC, Grieve was said to be &quot;very happy with the move&quot; which would suit his talents better.

On 28 May 2010, he was appointed to the Privy Council as part of the 2010 Dissolution of Parliament Honours List.

Following the 2010 general election, Grieve was appointed as Attorney General. He was one of four members of the cabinet who abstained in the May 2013 same-sex marriage vote. He said that he believed that the Bill had been &quot;badly conceived&quot;.

On 22 November 2013, Grieve was reported as stating politicians need to &quot;wake up&quot; to the issue of corruption in some minority communities and that &quot;corruption in parts of the Pakistani community is &#x27;endemic. Two days later he apologised and said he had not meant to suggest there was a &quot;particular problem in the Pakistani community&quot;.

Grieve was sacked from the cabinet by David Cameron in July 2014 and replaced by Jeremy Wright. Grieve believed this was because of his support for the European Court of Human Rights, although no reason was given; the sacking also occurred a few weeks after Grieve gave Cameron incorrect legal advice on whether he could make a public comment on the Andy Coulson trial.

Grieve volunteered at the Sufra food bank in January 2015 to highlight issues relating to the increased use of food banks. In October 2016, speaking at a fringe meeting of the Conservative party&#x27;s annual conference, Grieve warned that electoral fraud is found &quot;where there are high levels of inhabitants from a community in which there is a tradition of electoral corruption in their home countries.&quot; Although in the past he apologised for singling out the British Pakistani community, Grieve said it was not about any one group.

In July 2019, following the appointment of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Grieve described Johnson as a &quot;charlatan&quot;.

==== Removal of Conservative whip ====

On 3 September 2019, Grieve joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion which subsequently failed; the successful vote allowed a debate on a Bill which would block a no-deal Brexit. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative &quot;whip&quot;, expelling them as Conservative MPs, requiring them to sit as independents. If they decided to run for re-election in a future election, the Party would block their selection as Conservative candidates. In October 2019, Grieve announced that he was planning to stand again in his seat as an independent. The Liberal Democrats decided not to contest the Beaconsfield constituency (giving Grieve an increased chance at defeating the Conservative candidate Joy Morrissey). The deal was described at the time as &quot;the first significant move towards the formation of a &#x27;remain alliance&#x27; at the general election&quot;. He polled 16,765 votes (29%) losing the seat to Morrisey who polled 32,477 votes (56%), a majority of 15,712 on a 75% electoral turnout.

====Brexit====
Grieve was opposed to Brexit before the 2016 referendum.

In May 2017, prior to the general election and in support of the Conservative manifesto, Grieve stated on his website that &quot;the decision of the electorate in the Referendum must be respected and that I should support a reasoned process to give effect to it&quot;.

During the Brexit negotiation process, Grieve made a number of amendments against the Government&#x27;s plans to leave the EU. The first was to give Parliament a &quot;meaningful vote&quot; over the Brexit agreement – i.e. to force a motion by Parliament to approve the Brexit agreement which would have a binding effect on the government. In December 2017, he tabled an amendment (Amendment 7) to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill requiring any Brexit deal to be enacted by statute, rather than implemented by government order. The amendment was opposed by the government, but was passed in Parliament. Another proposed amendment tabled on 12 June 2018 (Amendment 19), and again on 20 June, was designed to strengthen the binding effect of the meaningful vote, by requiring that the government follow the directions of a Parliamentary motion in the event that Parliament does not approve the withdrawal agreement put by the government. Grieve threatened to rebel but ultimately voted with the government against the amendment after verbal assurances from Prime Minister Theresa May, presented as a compromise; the outcome was summarised by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;Technically, MPs can still have a vote on the final deal – or no deal – but unless it is a vote of confidence, the government can ignore it.&quot; Grieve&#x27;s 3rd amendment in December 2018 would mean Parliament would replace the Government in deciding the outcome of Brexit following a vote against the Government&#x27;s proposed deal with the EU.

On 24 July 2018, Grieve wrote a column for &quot;The Independent&quot; backing the online paper&#x27;s final say petition, which calls for the British electorate to have a &quot;final say on the Brexit deal&quot;. The petition was also backed by the leader of the People&#x27;s Vote campaign, MP Chuka Umunna. Grieve stated that Brexit puts the Conservative Party&#x27;s reputation for &quot;economic competence&quot; at risk.

Grieve wrote that Theresa May risked a &quot;polite rebellion&quot; from pro-EU MPs and a &quot;significant&quot; number would support another referendum if there was no deal. This followed a claim that Tory rebels are prepared to &quot;collapse the government&quot; to block a &quot;catastrophic&quot; Brexit deal.

Grieve was one of the signatories of a December 2018 statement by a group of senior Conservatives calling for a second referendum over Brexit. On 11 January 2019, during his speech to the convention for a second referendum, Grieve described Brexit as &quot;national suicide&quot;. Shortly afterwards, he co-founded the group Right to Vote. He also declared that he would resign the whip if the Conservative Party elected Boris Johnson as a successor to Theresa May or if the government took Britain out of the EU without a deal.

On 9 January 2019, Grieve made a successful amendment to a government business motion; the amendment was controversial due to the unusual circumstances in which it was permitted by Speaker John Bercow. &quot;Conservatives are furious that Mr Bercow accepted the Grieve amendment, as parliamentary rules usually only allow a government minister to amend motions of this kind.&quot; &quot;The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies – everything from a &quot;managed no-deal&quot; to a further referendum, via a &quot;Norway option&quot; or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table... MPs claim Mr Bercow broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own clerks.&quot;

Ultimately May&#x27;s withdrawal deal was rejected and on 29 January 2019, Grieve&#x27;s resulting amendment was defeated by the Government, supported by Labour rebels. The amendment would have &quot;Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister&#x27;s Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March... which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour&#x27;s plan, a second referendum, no deal and the Norway-style relationship&quot;.

On 29 March 2019 (the original planned date of Brexit), a motion of no confidence against Grieve was carried by his local party 182 votes to 131. At this, Grieve said he&#x27;ll carry on &#x27;exactly as before&#x27;. The motion triggers the first stage in the process of deselection. Grieve accused ex-UKIP opponent, Jon Conway, of &#x27;insurgency&#x27;, claiming Conway was behind the motion; a claim that Conway denied. Grieve has since been asked to apply for readoption by his local party.

Grieve&#x27;s proposal to block Government funding in order to enable MPs to have a vote on a No Deal Brexit was condemned by the Prime Minister Theresa May. Referencing Grieve&#x27;s attempt to halt Government spending on pensions and schools, May stated &quot;Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible&quot;; the pro-Brexit &quot;Telegraph&quot; newspaper condemned the actions as it &quot;risks taking our politics to new extreme&quot;. The attempt was, in any case, blocked by the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, and did not proceed to a vote.

Grieve has been credited as a contributor to a Labour Party motion designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the plans were kept secret until their unveiling on 11 June 2019, when Conservative leadership candidates began their campaigns. If successful, it would have seen MPs taking over the Westminster timetable on 25 June 2019 with a view to enshrining legislation which would prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. The motion was defeated by 309 votes to 298 the following day. Grieve said the motion was the &quot;last sensible opportunity&quot; to stop a no-deal Brexit. He added that in the future, if necessary, he would support efforts to bring down a Conservative government in a vote of no confidence if it was the only way to block such an outcome.

Later in June 2019, Grieve successfully proposed amendments which sought to thwart no-deal Brexit prorogation. Grieve&#x27;s first amendment to the 2019 Northern Ireland bill, which was initially a simple one intended to delay elections and budgets for the long-suspended Northern Ireland assembly and executive, required a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly – though it remained unclear whether this could be done as a written report, meaning the chamber would not necessarily have to sit. This was later changed via another amendment in the Lords, tabled by David Anderson, with support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This said the fortnightly reports demanded by Grieve&#x27;s amendments would have to be debated within five calendar days of being produced, thus necessitating that the Commons sits. When the bill returned to the Commons Grieve then added another tweak via a last-minute amendment, intending to increase the power to block prorogation even more. It specified that if ministers could not meet the obligation to update the Commons because it was prorogued or adjourned, parliament would have to meet on the day necessary to comply with the obligation and for the following five weekdays.

<text>Jane Patricia Griffiths (born 17 April 1954) is a British linguist and politician. She was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the Reading East parliamentary constituency at the 1997 general election. In 2004, Griffiths was deselected as the Labour candidate for Reading East by her local party. Consequently, she did not stand for re-election.

==Early life==
Attending Cedars Grammar School in Leighton Buzzard, Griffiths later studied at the University of Durham, gaining a degree in Russian. From 1977 to 1985, she was a linguist at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and from 1984 to 1997 the Asia editor for BBC Monitoring. At one stage, she was also an English teacher.

==Politics==
Griffiths&#x27; political career began in 1989 when she was elected to Reading Borough Council. She sat on the council, as a Labour member, until 1999.

Prior to the 1997 general election, Griffiths was selected as the Labour Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for the Reading East constituency. This had been a safe Conservative seat since its creation in 1983. The retiring Tory incumbent Gerard Vaughan had a majority of 14,555. Despite this, Griffiths emerged as one of the surprise winners of the general election.

In Parliament, she established a reputation as a fervent pro-European. Andrew Roth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her as a &quot;pro-EU partisan loyalist with an international outlook&quot;. As a backbench Labour MP, she was largely supportive of the Tony Blair administration. Griffiths acquired a reputation for being somewhat confrontational, voicing disagreement with Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Notably, she also called for legalized brothels.

At the 2001 general election, Griffiths increased her majority from 3,795 to 5,588. However, her disputes with her local party became much more public thereafter. In early 2002, she wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; about rampant sexism within the Parliamentary Labour Party. Subsequently, she alleged she was experiencing bullying by local Labour Party activists in Reading. This was denied by the local Party Chair. The ensuing tensions culminated in Griffiths&#x27; deselection as the candidate for the 2005 general election, a first for any MP in ten years. &#x27;Personality issues&#x27; were cited, whilst Griffiths contended she was the victim of a conspiracy by &#x27;1970s men&#x27;: her assertion was criticized as &#x27;wild conspiracy theories&#x27; in an open letter by seventeen female members of the party. She vowed not to stand as an independent, and the seat was contested by local Labour councillor Tony Page who lost by a very narrow margin, with Griffiths being succeeded by Conservative Rob Wilson in 2005. In between her deselection and the end of her term, she fought off suggestions she would defect to the Conservatives.

==Bankruptcy and arrest==
Four days after the 2005 general election Griffiths was declared bankrupt, owing £29,000 to the Inland Revenue. This would have disqualified her from retaking her seat in the House of Commons had she been reselected and reelected. She failed to appear at her bankruptcy hearing before Reading County Court on Monday 19 September 2005 and a warrant was subsequently issued for her arrest. After convincing the court she had the assets to pay her debts and would co-operate with the proceedings, the warrant was discharged. However, her discharge from bankruptcy was subsequently suspended on the grounds that she was not co-operating, stating that she was in Latvia. This was inaccurately reported in the local press as her being made bankrupt a second time.

==After politics==

===Blogs===
During 2005-6 Griffiths wrote a political blog, called &#x27;janestheone&#x27; after her election slogan in earlier days. On her blog, she described herself as &quot;a writer, linguist and political blogger&quot; and as being &quot;internationalist, anti-totalitarian and pro-democracy everywhere in the world&quot;. The blog was suspended following a complaint but she immediately started a new one. The new blog, like the old one, is devoted mainly to criticising Old Labour in general and Reading Labour Party in particular.

===Book===
In August 2008 she published a book entitled &quot;The One&quot;.

==Personal life==
Griffiths is married to Andrew Tattersall, who previously worked as her assistant. She has two children from a previous marriage. She currently lives in Strasbourg.

She was well known in her constituency as a keen rat fancier and owner of several pet rats. She also initiated the unsuccessful campaign to return the fireless locomotive &quot;Huntley &amp; Palmers No.1&quot; to Reading.

<text>Nigel Griffiths (born 20 May 1955) is a British Labour Party politician, and former Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh South from 1987 to 2010.

==Early life==
Nigel Griffiths was educated at Hawick High School in the Scottish Borders before attending the University of Edinburgh where he was awarded an MA in 1977. He finished his education at the now Moray House School of Education in Edinburgh in 1978. He was president of the University of Edinburgh Labour Group in 1976, where he first met and supported Gordon Brown, who had recently served as the student-elected Rector of the University.

In 1978, he worked as a secretary to the Lothian Development Council, before becoming a welfare rights worker with a pressure group working on behalf of people with learning disabilities in 1979. He remained in this position until his election to Parliament.

He worked with Anita Roddick to establish &quot;The Big Issue&quot; in Scotland and set up the Wester Hailes Citizens Advice Bureau. He is a member of Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth, and The Ramblers.

==Political career==
Griffiths joined the Labour Party in 1970 and was elected as a councillor on the City of Edinburgh Council in 1980, a position in which he remained until he became a member of the House of Commons. He also served as a member of the Edinburgh Health Council (1982–87). He was a member of the Edinburgh International Festival committee for three years from 1984 and was the chairman of the city council in 1986.

Griffiths was elected to parliament at the 1987 general election for Edinburgh South, when he ousted the sitting Conservative MP Michael Ancram by 1,859 votes and remained in the position until the 2010 general election. Griffiths tabled more than 1,000 questions to Conservative ministers in his first four months. He was made an Opposition Whip by Neil Kinnock in 1987, becoming a spokesman for eight years for the Department of Trade and Industry in 1989.

When Labour was elected in the 1997 general election, he became the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, with responsibility for competition and consumer affairs. He was sacked by Tony Blair in his first reshuffle of 1998 after arguments with civil servants in the department. He spent the rest of the parliament as a member of both the procedure and the public accounts select committees. He returned to government following the 2001 general election with the same rank at the Department of Trade and Industry, this time with responsibility for small business.

In 2002 the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards upheld complaints that Griffiths owned an office for which he was claiming expenses for rent of £10,000 a year.

Between 2005 and 2007, Griffiths served as Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, deputising for both Geoff Hoon and then Jack Straw. He resigned over the renewal of the British Trident system in March 2007.

In 2006, Nigel Griffiths has commented on the debate over veils stating &quot;The justification I have heard is that some Muslim women feel &#x27;comfortable&#x27; wearing the full veil, but it doesn&#x27;t make others comfortable.&quot;

In March 2009, &quot;The News of the World&quot; alleged that Griffiths had an extramarital affair in his House of Commons office. He later admitted to this and apologised. He subsequently launched a legal action against the newspaper for invading his privacy and obtaining the material that supported the allegations &quot;in an extremely underhand way&quot;.

In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported Griffiths had attempted to claim £3,600 for a television, DVD and digital radio to watch and listen to Scottish broadcasts. The claim was rejected by the Fees Office.

On 31 January 2010, Griffiths announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election, and said that he would be taking up a job with an &quot;international educational institution&quot;.

In late 2015 Griffiths became Scottish Co-ordinator of the Labour Leave campaign. In January 2016 he &quot;stole a march on his old ally Gordon Brown, unveiling an anti-EU poster as the former PM was preparing to launch the party’s Scottish campaign for staying in.&quot; In the same month Griffiths helped to set up the cross-party Grassroots Out group.

<text>Merab Mamardashvili (, ; September 15, 1930 – November 25, 1990) was a Georgian philosopher.

==Biography==
He was born in Gori (Eastern Georgia). In 1955, he graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy, Moscow State University. From 1968 to 1987, he was a deputy editor of the scientific journal &quot;Voprosy Filosofii&quot; (&quot;Questions of Philosophy&quot;). He became a professor at the Moscow State University and a senior research fellow at the Moscow Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Science. From 1987 to 1990, Mamardashvili was head of the Department at the Tsereteli Institute of Philosophy, at the Georgian Academy of Sciences and a Professor at the Tbilisi State University.

He died from a heart attack at Moscow Vnukovo airport on November 25, 1990, and was buried in Tbilisi in a family grave, at the Saburtalo cemetery. In May 2001, a monument to him was unveiled in Tbilisi.

==Philosophical activity==
In his life, only a few books were published, his lectures (for his style of lecturing, he and others called them &quot;dialogues&quot; or &quot;conversations&quot;, and he was called &quot;Russian (or Georgian) Socrates&quot;) were taped and published after his death by his disciple Yuri Senokosov, co-founder with Elena Nemirovskaya of the former Moscow School of Political Studies . Lecturing abroad, Mamardashvili gave talks in Germany, France, and other countries. 

Influenced by René Descartes and classical German philosophy (especially Immanuel Kant), Mamardashvili contributed to the rationalist theory of perception. His main research fields were the general gnoseological notion of processes of analysis and synthesis, the methodology of science and the historic-philosophical studies, the role of consciousness in social being, the relationship between consciousness and the aesthetics, and the overall meta-theory of language and consciousness. He considered consciousness the ultimate subject of philosophy. Some of the most famous phrases coined by Mamardashvili are: &quot;consciousness is paradoxicalness impossible to get used to&quot;, &quot;consciousness is an experience of inexperiencible experiences&quot;, &quot;phenomenology is the accompanying feature of all of philosophy&quot;, &quot;loneliness is my profession&quot; and so on.

In the preview to the edition of the major compilation of his works in 2002, he was introduced as &quot;one of the most interesting contemporary philosophers, a man of impeccable style, magical fascination and rare kindness&quot;. It was also noted there that all of his interests were concentrated around the human personality, its freedom and responsibility, and the role of philosophy in life and its place in culture.

<doc id="427345" wikidata="Q6236465" url="?curid=427345" title="John Grogan (politician)">
<text>John Timothy Grogan (born 24 February 1961) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Selby between 1997 and 2010 and for Keighley between 2017 and 2019. He is currently chair of the Mongolian–British Chamber of Commerce (MBCC).

==Early life==

Born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, Grogan was educated at St Michael&#x27;s RC College, a Jesuit school in Leeds and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Modern History and Economics in 1982, and also served as the first President of the Oxford University Student Union, the first to be elected on a Labour Party (UK) platform.

He worked as a communications coordinator with the Leeds City Council from 1987 to 1994 before setting up his own conference business from 1996 to 1997. He worked for the Labour Party in various capacities in both Leeds and Wolverhampton. He also acted as the Labour Party press officer in the European Parliament at Brussels in 1995.

==Parliamentary career==
=== Selby (1997–2010) ===
Grogan unsuccessfully contested the North Yorkshire seat of Selby at the 1987 general election against the Conservative MP Michael Alison, losing by 13,779 votes. He contested the seat for the second time at the 1992 general election but was again defeated by Alison, this time by 9,508 votes.

Between the 1987 and 1992 elections, he also stood unsuccessfully to become a Member of the European Parliament for York in 1989.

Grogan was then elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election for Selby. As the incumbent Alison had retired at the election, he defeated the former Conservative MP for West Lancashire, Kenneth Hind, who had lost his seat in 1992, with a majority of 3,836. He made his maiden speech on 7 July 1997.

He led the campaign to save the Selby Coalfield in 2002. In 1999, he called for a memorial to the heroism of women during World War II to be remembered on the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square, with the campaign gaining the backing of the then Speaker of the House of Commons, Betty Boothroyd, and the Princess Royal. Although the campaign was unsuccessful a monument has since been erected in Whitehall.

In the 2005 general election, he retained his seat with a reduced majority of 467 votes, making the seat the 15th most marginal Labour-held seat in the UK. During his time as in parliament, Grogan served as a member of the Northern Ireland Select committee from 1997 until 2001, and then again from 2005 until 2010.

In 2009, Grogan gained national coverage for his campaign against the proposed options for the privatisation of Royal Mail. detention of suspects for 42 days, gambling deregulation,

Grogan helped lead the rebellion on the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, resulting in two Government defeats on the bill and &#x27;threatening&#x27; rather than &#x27;insulting&#x27; behaviour being established as the test of religious hatred. At the public bill committee stage of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 he proposed an amendment, winning 8–7 against the Government. This ensured that the Regional Flood and Coastal Management Committees retained the power to approve the Environment Agency&#x27;s flood management bill rather than just the right to be consulted about it.

He campaigned against the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport, the top-up tuition fee reforms in 2004 and voted against the UK&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War in 2003. While serving as an MP, he also campaigned for reform of the licensing laws, the smoking ban, bus regulation and public service broadcasting. Grogan also campaigned for the protection of the rights of agency workers, the regulation of lobbyists and access for all to sporting listed events on free-to-air TV. He was also the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Groups on the BBC, Beer and Mongolia.

While serving as the MP for Selby, Grogan also supported the building of a new by-pass for Selby, as well as a new hospital and the expansion of its flood defences.

In 2006, Grogan confirmed he would not contest the next general election after boundary changes were made to his Selby Constituency.

During and after the 2009 expenses scandal, Grogan was criticised by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for claiming £150.00 on parliamentary expenses for English language tuition for a Mongolian intern. The expense was reported by the newspaper to have been incurred in order for the intern to be able to &quot;understand his [Mr Grogan&#x27;s] constituents&#x27; Yorkshire accents&quot;.

In 2010 Grogan and Tom Watson led parliamentary opposition on the Government benches to the Digital Economy Bill and the parliamentary campaign to save BBC Radio 6 Music and the BBC Asian Network from closure.

=== Keighley (2017–2019) ===
In 2013, Grogan was selected as the Labour candidate for Keighley for the 2015 general election. He lost to the Conservative candidate Kris Hopkins by a margin of 3,053 votes. He re-fought the seat in the 2017 general election, winning with a majority of 239 votes.

==== Local causes ====
In Keighley Grogan championed a variety of causes including a new police station, the survival of rugby league club Keighley Cougars, a refurbished railway station, the campaign to re-open the Skipton-Colne railway line and the campaign against a planned incinerator. In neighbouring Ilkley he worked closely with the Clean River Group to stop the discharge of raw sewage into the River Wharfe and to apply to the Department of the Environment for designated bathing status.

==== In Parliament ====
In 2018 Grogan was the only Labour MP to vote against his party&#x27;s amendments to the Data Protection Act 2018 on the grounds that they threatened press freedom. In Parliament he also helped revive campaigns to expand the number of listed sporting events not permitted to be broadcast solely on pay television services and for trains to be run on Boxing Day. He chaired the All Party Parliamentary Groups on Albania, Kosovo, Mongolia, Peru and Portugal.

Grogan is a longstanding supporter of Yorkshire Devolution and since 2018 he has been co-chair of the One Yorkshire Committee, which brings together Members of Parliament, council leaders, businesses and trade unions to campaign for Devolution across the whole of Yorkshire.

Grogan is a signatory of the &quot;MPs Not Border Guards&quot; pledge, which vows to not report constituents to the Home Office for immigration enforcement.

He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel as well as Labour Friends of Palestine &amp; the Middle East.

Grogan lost his Keighley seat in the 2019 general election to the Conservative candidate Robbie Moore. In November 2022, he was elected by members as the prospective parliamentary candidate in Keighley and Ilkley for the 2024 general election. In the election he was defeated again by Robbie Moore, who won against the national swing.

== Outside politics ==
From 2013 to 2015 Grogan chaired the Hatfield Colliery Trust, which was responsible for the employee-owned mine near Doncaster. This was the penultimate coal mine to close in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="427347" wikidata="Q7150945" url="?curid=427347" title="Paul Goodman, Baron Goodman of Wycombe">
<text>Paul Alexander Cyril Goodman, Baron Goodman of Wycombe (born 17 November 1959) is an English journalist and Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wycombe from 2001 to 2010, during which time he was a Shadow Minister shadowing the Department for Communities and Local Government. In 2024, Goodman was elevated to the House of Lords by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

From 2013 to 2024, Goodman served as editor of the centre-right political blog &quot;ConservativeHome&quot;. His work on the blog earned him a reputation for wielding significant influence over the Conservative Party, the centre-left &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine calling him the &quot;authoritative commentator or Tory politics&quot; and the 28th most powerful right-wing figure in Britain.

==Early life==
Paul Goodman was born the son of Jewish parents in London, and converted to Roman Catholicism in his mid-twenties. He was raised in East Sheen, and was privately educated at the Cranleigh School, Surrey before attending the University of York where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1981. He was Chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students between 1983 and 1984, and was a member of the National Union of Students Executive during the two previous years.

==Political career==
In 1977 he worked for a year as a researcher for Michael Mates, the Conservative MP for Petersfield. In 1983 he was the chairman for the Federation of Conservative Students, and was appointed as a director of public affairs at Extel Consultancy in 1984, before becoming a researcher for two years to Tom King, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and MP for Bridgwater, in 1985. He was a briefly a member of the policy unit at the City of Westminster Council in 1988 before training as a novice monk at Quarr Abbey in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. He left the abbey in 1990 to take up the position of news editor with the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, before becoming a lead writer with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1991, moving to be a reporter with &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in 1992, before returning to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a comment editor in 1995, remaining as a leader writer since his election to Westminster.

He was elected to the House of Commons for Wycombe in Buckinghamshire at the 2001 general election following the retirement of Ray Whitney. Goodman held Wycombe with a majority of 3,168 and remained the MP there until the 2010 general election. He made his maiden speech on 27 June 2001, in which he recalled the former Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who had once contested his seat.

In parliament he served on the Work and Pensions Select committee 2001–5. He also served for a year as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chairman of the Conservative Party David Davis from 2001, and was promoted to the frontbench by Michael Howard in 2003 as a spokesman on work and pensions. On David Cameron becoming Conservative leader in 2005, Paul Goodman was made a spokesman on Treasury matters. On 5 June 2009, amidst the uncertainty caused by the parliamentary expenses scandal, he announced in the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot; that he would not stand for Parliament at the next general election. He said &quot;a House in which professional politics predominates, entrenching and empowering a taxpayer-dependent political class distinct and separate from those who elect them...for better or worse, this future Commons isn&#x27;t for me&quot;.

Goodman was nominated for a life peerage by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and on 11 March 2024 was created &quot;Baron Goodman of Wycombe, of High Wycombe in the County of Buckinghamshire&quot;.

==Personal life==
He has been married to Fiona Mary Ann Gill since 1999 and they have a son, named Daniel.

Jiangyin&#x27;s name means &quot;River Shade&quot;, from its location on the south or shady side of the Yangtze River.

==History==

Jiangyin was a township of Yanling (; later known as Piling, ) county initially. Since the township was located in the north of Ji Lake, it was given the name &quot;Jiyang&quot; (). In 281, it was promoted as a county of Piling commandery. In 558, the north-west part was taken away from then Lanling county (Wujin and its around areas) to create Jiangyin county. It was served as the seat of Jiangyin commandery, of which jurisdiction equating to the modern city&#x27;s, until the commandery was dissolved in 589. It was elevated to &quot;jun&quot; (military prefecture) status during Southern Tang, until being restored as a county of Changzhou in 1071. It developed as an important port for overseas trades, and a Maritime Trade Supervisorate () was established to manage in 1145. The county became a &quot;zhou&quot; (smaller prefecture) during Yuan dynasty, but was reduced to county status again in 1367.

In 1472, the sandbank in the Yangtze River was independent from the county to establish Jingjiang county. In 1645, the draconian enforcement of the decree adopting the Manchu hair style and dress inflamed the local Han Chinese people&#x27;s spirit to resist. Since the ultimatum &quot;either lose your hair or lose your head&quot; was given, they held the walled city against Qing sieges under a magistrate Yan Yingyuan () &#x27;s leadership.

On 23 April 1987, Jiangyin was approved by the State Council of China to become a county-level city.

==Administrative divisions==
At present, Jiangyin City has 5 subdistricts and 11 towns.

<doc id="427362" wikidata="Q5235586" url="?curid=427362" title="David Jamieson (British politician)">
<text>David Charles Jamieson (born 18 May 1947) is a British politician who served as the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner from 2014 to 2021. A member of the Labour Party, he was previously the Member of Parliament (MP) for Plymouth Devonport from 1992 to 2005 and a Solihull Metropolitan Borough Councillor from 2010 to 2014.

==Early life and career==
Born in Solihull, England, he was educated at Tudor Grange Grammar school, and later at St Peter&#x27;s College, Saltley, Birmingham.

Before becoming an MP, he was a teacher at Riland Bedford School and later a head of Mathematics at Crown Hills Community College between 1970 and 1981, before becoming the senior vice principal of the John Kitto Community College in Plymouth (1981–1992).

==Political career==
===Early career===
Jamieson was elected to the County Borough of Solihull Council for the Lyndon ward at a by-election in July 1970, having been an unsuccessful candidate in the elections in May of that year. He stood for the same ward in 1973 when elections for the new Metropolitan Borough of Solihull was established but the three Conservative candidates were all narrowly elected.

Jamieson first stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, for Birmingham Hall Green in February 1974, losing to Conservative incumbent Reginald Eyre by 21,036 votes (43.5%) to 27,280 (56.5%). He was then the Labour Party candidate for Plymouth Drake in 1987, gaining 9,451 votes (24%) and coming third, behind SDP–Liberal Alliance candidate David Astor and the incumbent Conservative MP, Janet Fookes.

===Member of Parliament===
He then stood for Plymouth Devonport in the 1992 general election and was successful, defeating Conservative candidate Keith Simpson by 24,953 votes (48.7%) to 17,541 votes (34.3%).

After the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy, in which four Southway Community College pupils died on a canoeing expedition with the St Albans Challenge Centre in Lyme Bay, Dorset, in 1993, he guided a private member&#x27;s bill through the House of Commons which became the Activity Centres (Young Persons Safety) Act 1995; the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority was established in January 1995 to implement the new law.

He was re-elected in 1997 with 31,629 votes (60.9%) and was appointed a government whip. After being re-elected in 2001 with 24,322 votes (58.3%), he was appointed the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Department for Transport, with responsibility for shipping, rail and aviation. He remained there until leaving office on 10 May 2005.

He chose to step down at the 2005 general election, saying that he had achieved all he set out to and likened his departure to a chapter in a book coming to a natural end. He also felt that the Mackay Vision would be best served by a new MP taking it forward. He was succeeded by Labour candidate Alison Seabeck.

After leaving the House of Commons, Jamieson worked as a consultant for Golden Arrow Communications, which represented transport companies such as Hutchinson Ports, National Express and GNER.

===Local councillor===
Jamieson was elected to Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council on 7 May 2010 representing the Kingshurst &amp; Fordbridge ward in the north of the Borough, and was promoted to hold the Cabinet portfolio for Transport and Highways following the formation of a Liberal Democrat-Labour coalition administration on the authority on 25 May 2010.

He subsequently became leader of the Labour group on the council, but in the May 2014 elections, he lost his seat to UK Independence Party candidate Debbie Evans. He polled 713 votes to her 1,022. Speaking to the &quot;Solihull Observer&quot;, he said, &quot;I will now enjoy retirement. I have already retired once but this time I mean it. Before I stood in this election I said that this would be the last time I stand.&quot;

===Police and Crime Commissioner===
In June 2014 he indicated he was a candidate for the vacancy of West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner; on 14 July, the selection panel chose him as the official Labour Party candidate. The vacancy was caused by the death of the incumbent, Bob Jones, formerly a Labour councillor from Wolverhampton.

The election was held on 21 August 2014 and Jamieson was declared the winner with 50.8% of the vote. Shortly afterwards, he was sworn in and confirmed that Yvonne Mosquito, the Acting PCC, and Jones&#x27; deputy, would be his deputy.

His first pledge after being elected was to find the money to reactivate all of the West Midlands&#x27; speed cameras, and he said that his top priorities were recruiting more police officers, improving neighbourhood policing and reducing the number of fatalities and injuries on the region&#x27;s roads.

Jamieson was re-elected in 2016. After narrowly missing out on victory with 49.8% of the vote in the first round, he won 63.3% in the second round against the Conservative candidate.

Jamieson did not run for re-election in the elections in 2021.

<doc id="427366" wikidata="Q727852" url="?curid=427366" title="Bernard Jenkin">
<text>Sir Bernard Christison Jenkin (born 9 April 1959) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Harwich and North Essex, previously Colchester North then North Essex, since 1992. He also served as chair of the Liaison Committee. 

Jenkin was elected chairman of the Public Administration Select Committee in May 2010. He is a longstanding critic of the European Union, believing that EU membership undermined the United Kingdom&#x27;s national sovereignty, and he was one of the Maastricht Rebels during the premiership of John Major. In the 2016 EU referendum he supported Brexit and from 2017 he was one of the most vocal supporters of the Eurosceptic pressure group Leave Means Leave.

==Early life and career==
Bernard Jenkin was born on 9 April 1959 in Wood Green, to Patrick Jenkin, who subsequently became a Conservative MP and Cabinet minister, and later a life peer (as Baron Jenkin of Roding); and Monica Jenkin (née Graham). He is a descendant of the scientist Fleeming Jenkin.

He was educated at the fee-paying independent Highgate School, the voluntary aided William Ellis School, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a choral exhibition and gained a BA honours degree in English literature in 1982. He was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1982.

After graduation, Jenkin worked for Ford and the private equity company 3i as Manager of Legal &amp; General Ventures from 1989 to 1992. From 1992 to 1995, he was an advisor to Legal &amp; General Group plc.

Jenkin stood for election as the Conservative candidate in Glasgow Central at the 1987 general election, coming second with 13% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Bob McTaggart.

==Parliamentary career==

=== 1st term (1992–1997) ===
At the 1992 general election, his 33rd birthday, Jenkin was elected as MP for Colchester North with 51.5% of the vote and a majority of 16,402.

During John Major&#x27;s government, Jenkin was one of the Maastricht Rebels who defied the party whip to oppose the Maastricht Treaty.

=== 2nd term (1997–2001) ===
Prior to the 1997 general election, Colchester North was abolished, and replaced with North Essex. At the general election, Jenkin was elected as MP for North Essex with 43.9% of the vote and a majority of 5,476.

William Hague appointed him Shadow Minister for Transport, serving from 1998 to 2001.

=== 3rd term (2001–2005) ===
At the 2001 general election, Jenkin was re-elected as MP for North Essex with an increased vote share of 47.4% and an increased majority of 7,186.

Jenkin served as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence from 2001 to 2003 under Iain Duncan Smith and Shadow Regions Secretary from 2003 to 2005 under Michael Howard.

=== 4th term (2005–2010) ===
Jenkin was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 47.6% and an increased majority of 10,903. He was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party after the general election and served until 7 November 2006, when he was replaced by John Maples. Jenkin&#x27;s deputy chairman role came to an end when, during a shadow cabinet reshuffle, he was offered another frontbench position, which he declined, reportedly saying to David Cameron that only a return to the shadow cabinet would interest him.

In 2006, Jenkin faced criticism after he used the word &quot;coloured&quot; when referring to a British Asian Conservative A-List candidate, Ali Miraj.

=== 5th term (2010–2015) ===
Prior to the 2010 general election, Jenkin&#x27;s constituency of North Essex was abolished and replaced with Harwich and North Essex. At the election, Jenkin was elected as MP for Harwich and North Essex with 46.9% of the vote and a majority of 11,447.

In May 2012, Jenkin was re-elected as a member of the Executive of the 1922 Committee.

Jenkin, who gained a reputation as a critic of the Coalition government, led calls to drop the House of Lords Reform Bill 2012. Jenkin voted in favour of same sex marriage in 2013 &quot;as a matter of principle&quot;, whilst acknowledging the decision to hold the debate caused much &quot;political unhappiness&quot;.

In January 2014, Jenkin drafted a letter calling for Prime Minister Cameron to renegotiate Britain&#x27;s relationship with the EU to give the House of Commons powers to veto EU legislation, which was ultimately signed by 95 MPs, and reportedly backed by another six. Following the Scottish independence referendum and promises made to further devolve powers to Scotland, Jenkin called for the creation of an &quot;English First Minister&quot; and for departments responsible for policy that applied only in England to be accountable only to the English MPs.

=== 6th term (2015–2017) ===
Jenkin was re-elected as MP for Harwich and North Essex at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 51% and an increased majority of 15,174. Following the general election, he was returned unopposed as the chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee.

Jenkin was one of the most vocal supporters of the Eurosceptic pressure group Leave Means Leave, and was a prominent Leave supporter in the Brexit referendum.

=== 7th term (2017–2019) ===
At the snap 2017 general election, Jenkin was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 58.5% and a decreased majority of 14,356.

In September 2019, Jenkin criticised the House of Commons speaker John Bercow, stating that he was &quot;irretrievably politicised and radicalised&quot;. This comment came after Bercow made a speech warning Boris Johnson that &quot;the only form of Brexit which we will have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed&quot;.

=== 8th term (2019–2024) ===
Jenkin was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with an increased vote share of 60.3% and an increased majority of 20,182.

Although a sceptic of lockdown, Jenkin supported the first COVID-19 tier regulations in England. However, he urged Boris Johnson to put forward a white paper on the issue, setting out how the UK can deal with COVID-19 through treatments, social distancing and an improved NHS Test and Trace.

In 2021, he was a critic of Russia, and urged the government to take action in Ukraine.

In June 2023 Boris Johnson called for Jenkin to resign, after his participation in the Commons Select Committee of Privileges which investigated whether Johnson had misled parliament, when it was reported by the Guido Fawkes website that Jenkin had attended an event on 8 December 2020 in parliament. It was reportedly the date of his wife&#x27;s birthday, with a &quot;drinks party&quot; held by Eleanor Laing, a Commons deputy speaker, in her office. In December 2023, it was found that the allegations did not meet the threshold for a fixed penalty notice by the police.

In December 2023, Jenkin was placed under investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Daniel Greenberg, for alleged &quot;actions causing significant damage to the reputation of the House as a whole, or of its Members generally&quot;. On 26 March, Greenberg&#x27;s investigation determined the allegations would not be upheld.

=== 9th term (2024–) ===
At the 2024 general election, Jenkin was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 34.4% and a decreased majority of 1,162.

==Expenses claims==
In May 2009, Jenkin was reported by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to have used £50,000 in expenses to pay his sister-in-law rent on the property he uses as his constituency home. Jenkin said that he was just paying &quot;an honest and reasonable rent&quot; for the property. On 27 October 2009, it was initially recommended that Bernard Jenkin pay back £63,250 by expenses auditor Sir Thomas Legg. This is the highest amount known to have been recommended after an audit of MPs&#x27; claims on second homes expenses. His father ultimately settled the bill for him. This amount was reduced to £36,250 following an appeal.

==In popular culture==
Jenkin&#x27;s role on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee was dramatised in the 2017 verbatim musical &quot;Committee: (A New Musical)&quot;, which retold the downfall of the charity Kids Company and which was first performed at the Donmar Warehouse. Jenkin was portrayed by actor Alexander Hanson.

Jenkin was portrayed by Tim McMullan in the 2019 Channel 4 drama &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==

Jenkin married Anne Strutt in 1988 and has two sons. He is an occasional naturist, and a long-time acquaintance of screenwriter Richard Curtis, who typically includes a character named &#x27;Bernard&#x27; in everything he writes.

He separated from his wife in 2023.

Jenkin is the vice-president of the UK charity Combat Stress, which offers residential treatment to ex-servicemen and women suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. To mark his 50th birthday, he held a fundraising event in March 2009 which raised over £50,000 for the charity.

==Honours==
In 2018, Jenkin was awarded with a knighthood honouring his political and public service.

Jenkin is in favour of marriage equality and was nominated for a Stonewall award in 2013. The Climate Coalition awarded him the Green Heart Hero Award in May 2018 for his eco-friendly lifestyle choices.

<doc id="427368" wikidata="Q19583" url="?curid=427368" title="Gori, Georgia">
<text>Gori ( ) is a city in eastern Georgia, which serves as the regional capital of Shida Kartli. It is located at the confluence of two rivers, the Mtkvari and the Liakhvi. Gori is the fifth most populous city in Georgia. Its name comes from the Georgian word &quot;gora&quot; (გორა), meaning &quot;heap&quot;, &quot;hill&quot;, or &quot;mountain&quot;.

A settlement known here from the Hellenistic period, with the Gori Fortress built at least in 7th century, it received town status in the 12th century. Gori was an important military stronghold in the Middle Ages and maintains a strategic importance due to its location on the principal highway connecting eastern and western parts of Georgia. In the course of its history, Gori has been invaded by the armies of regional powers several times. The city was occupied by Russian troops during the 2008 Russo–Georgian War.

Gori is also known as the birthplace of communist revolutionary and Soviet politician Joseph Stalin, ballistic missile designer Aleksandr Nadiradze, and philosopher Merab Mamardashvili.

==Geography and climate==
Gori is located 86 kilometres west of Georgia&#x27;s capital Tbilisi, at the confluence of the rivers Mtkvari and Greater Liakhvi, above sea level. The climate is humid subtropical, transitioning to humid continental climate, with warm and moderately humid weather. Summer is usually hot. The average annual temperature is , minimal in January () and maximal in July and August (). The maximum precipitation falls in May () and minimum in February (). Precipitation here averages .

Highest recorded temperature: on 13 August 2006

Lowest recorded temperature: on 16 December 2004


==History==

The territory of Gori has been populated since the early Bronze Age. According to medieval Georgian chronicles, the town of Gori was founded by King David IV (r. 1089–1125) who settled refugees from Armenia there. However, the fortress of Gori (Goris-Tsikhe) appears to have been in use already in the 7th century, and archaeological evidence indicates the existence of an urban community in Classical Antiquity. In 1299, Gori was captured by the Alan tribesmen fleeing the Mongol conquest of their original homeland in the North Caucasus. The Georgian king George V recovered the town in 1320, pushing the Alans back over the Caucasus Mountains.
With the downfall of the medieval Georgian kingdom, Gori – strategically located at the crossroads of major transit routes – was frequently targeted by foreign invaders, and changed its masters on several occasions. It was first taken and sacked by Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu in 1477, followed by Tahmasp I of Persia in the mid-16th century. By the end of that century, Gori briefly passed to the Ottomans through the 1578–90 Ottoman–Persian War, and became their major outpost in Georgia until being recovered by the Georgians under Simon I of Kartli after heavy fighting in 1599. The town was once again garrisoned by the Persians under Shah Abbas I in 1614. Following successive occupations by the Ottomans (1723–35) and Persians (1735–40s), Gori returned to Georgian control under the kings Teimuraz II and Erekle II whose efforts helped to advance economy and culture in the town. Following the Russian annexation of Georgia, Gori was granted the status of a town within the Gori Uyezd of the Tiflis Governorate in 1801. It grew in size and population throughout the 19th century. A plan of 1824 shows the town on the hill slopes below the citadel, and a moat around it. The town was destroyed in the 1920 earthquake, and almost completely rebuilt in the Soviet period. An important industrial center in Soviet times, Gori suffered from an economic collapse and the outflow of the population during the years of a post-Soviet crisis of the 1990s.

Gori is close to the Georgian–Ossetian conflict zone. It is connected to breakaway South Ossetia&#x27;s capital Tskhinvali via a railroad spur which has been defunct since the early 1990s. Since the 2000s, Georgia has increased the military infrastructure in and around the city. Thus, the Central Military Hospital was relocated from Tbilisi to Gori and re-equipped in October 2006. On January 18, 2008, Georgia&#x27;s second NATO-standard base to accommodate the 1st Infantry Brigade (Georgia) of the Georgian Ground Forces was established at Gori. The Georgian Agrarian Science Academy Branch was established in the city in 1995; this became Sukhishvili University in 2003.

===2008 conflict===
In the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the town came under aerial attack by the Russian Air Force from the outset of the conflict. Military targets and residential districts of Gori were hit by the airstrikes, resulting in civilian injuries and deaths. Human Rights Watch (HRW) claimed that Russian forces had indiscriminately deployed cluster bombs in civilian areas around Gori. According to HRW, on August 12 Russian forces dropped cluster bombs in the centre of Gori, killing 11 civilians and wounding dozens more. Russian military officials deny using cluster munitions in the conflict, calling the HRW assertion &quot;slanderous&quot; and questioning the HRW&#x27;s objectivity. Numerous unexploded &quot;bomblets&quot; have been found by locals and HRW employees.

By August 11, Georgian military personnel, government, and most residents had fled the city, which was then captured and occupied by the Russian military and South Ossetian separatist militia. HRW accused the militia of unleashing a campaign of looting, arson, kidnapping and other attacks against the remaining civilian population. The Russian and South Ossetian forces withdrew from the city on August 22, 2008. The following day Units of the Georgian Army returned to Gori. However, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori as well as in so-called buffer zones near the borders with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

==Demographics==



==Landmarks==

Gori and its environs house several notable cultural and historical landmarks. Although for many foreigners Gori is principally known as the birthplace of Joseph Stalin, in Georgian historical memory the city has long been associated with its citadel, the Gori Fortress, which is built on a cliffy hill overlooking the central part of the modern city. On another hill stands the 18th century St. George&#x27;s church of Gorijvari, a popular place of pilgrimage. The famous ancient rock-hewn town of Uplistsikhe and the 7th century Ateni Sioni Church are located not far from Gori.

Stalin&#x27;s association with the city is emphasized by the Joseph Stalin Museum in downtown Gori and, until recently, the Stalin monument in front of the Gori City Hall, one of the few such monuments to survive Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinization program. The monument was a source of controversy in a newly independent Georgia in the 1990s, but for several years the post-communist government acceded to the Gori citizens&#x27; request and left the statue untouched. It was ultimately removed on June 25, 2010. However, on 20 December 2012, the municipal assembly of Gori voted to reinstate the monument.

The city is divided into 11 administrative districts, they are:

<doc id="427369" wikidata="Q6811295" url="?curid=427369" title="Melanie Johnson">
<text>Melanie Jane Johnson (born 5 February 1955) is a Labour politician in the United Kingdom. She was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1997 to 2005 and served as a minister in the government of Tony Blair.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Ipswich. She attended the Independent Clifton High School in Clifton, Bristol. Leaving Bristol for London, she studied at University College London, gaining a BA in Philosophy and Ancient Greek (1976). Following this she moved to Cambridge, continuing to study Philosophy at postgraduate level at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. From the age of 19 onwards she was an active member of the Labour Party and for over a decade was a County Councillor. From 1981 to 1988, she was Member Relations Officer for Cambridge Co-op, then Retail Administration Manager from 1988 to 1990. She was Assistant General Manager in Quality Assurance for Cambridge Family Health Service Authority from 1990 to 1992. Johnson was a schools inspector for Ofsted from 1993 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1994 Johnson unsuccessfully stood for Labour in the Cambridgeshire seat at the European Parliamentary election. Two years later she was selected to stand for Labour in the United Kingdom Parliament through an all-women shortlist.

She was first elected in the 1997 election overturning a majority of 6,583. Johnson won her seat, Welwyn Hatfield, following a statement made by her opponent, David Evans, which made national newspaper headlines. Evans was taped by sixth-form students (at Stanborough School, Welwyn Garden City) denouncing Johnson as &quot;a single girl, lives with her boyfriend, three bastard children&quot; and saying she had &quot;never done a proper job&quot;. At this time Johnson was working as a school inspector and living with her partner of 18 years, raising their young family. In this taped statement Evans claimed Johnson did not &quot;have a chance in hell&quot;. Evans also criticised her for living in Cambridge rather than actually in his then constituency.

In her maiden speech Johnson commented that Evans was&quot; widely renowned for his plain speaking&quot; but could be &quot;personally very charming. I saw that for myself on election night when he congratulated me on my victory in Welwyn Hatfield and recorded how much he had enjoyed being a Member of Parliament&quot;. She further commented &quot;I am a firm believer in diversity and my own style will be a little different from his. As a mother of three, I can assure the House that my children will help to keep my feet on the ground.&quot;

Johnson was re-elected in the 2001 elections with a reduced majority. Welwyn Hatfield had never previously been held for more than one term by a Labour MP.

From 1999 to 2005 Johnson was a junior minister serving first as Economic Secretary to the Treasury, next in the DTI as Minister for Competition and Consumers, and finally as Minister for Public Health in the Department of Health. Johnson was also responsible for the White Paper Building Trust in Statistics As Economic Secretary she supported the EU action against money laundering stating &quot;Money laundering is a very serious offence, with the capacity to undermine financial markets and to corrupt professional advisers&quot; Following the 2000 Budget Johnson, whilst speaking to NPI Conference, commented &quot;in the Budget three weeks ago now, this Government took the next steps towards our ambition for a Britain of opportunity and security not just for a few but for all, with prosperity reaching the people and places the economy has too long forgotten.&quot;. Journalist Benedict Brogan likened the delivery of her speeches to &quot;the read-your-weight manner of a supermarket Tannoy&quot; describing them as tedious and accusing her of just repeating &quot;the mantra that had been programmed into her&quot;.

During Johnson&#x27;s time in DTI she gained media coverage for her concerns regarding &quot;US regulators (having) the power to monitor, investigate and discipline UK auditors&quot;. Johnson was also responsible for Government&#x27;s Enterprise Bill, commenting that &#x27;We will provide a robust regime for dealing with those who abuse their creditors.&#x27;

After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 Johnson became more vocal on the issue, stating &quot;Breast cancer can happen to any woman, regardless of who she is. I am acutely aware it is something many women still do not believe will happen to them.&quot; Cancer was later to become one of Johnson&#x27;s responsibilities as Public Health Minister.

As Public Health Minister, her responsibilities included policy on smoking, obesity, drugs, alcohol, diet and nutrition, communicable diseases, sexual health, sustainable development and health inequalities. 
One of her key roles was to improve cervical smear testing, which she achieved in a move to get new better smear tests. With the new test Johnson introduced, there were less false positives, meaning fewer women were now required to return for a second smear due to an error with their first test. Johnson additionally announced plans in 2004 to cut domestic violence during pregnancy with the integration of routine enquiries into antenatal appointments.

Johnson campaigned to cut salt levels, setting targets to significantly reduce salt in foods in order to improve cardiovascular health. She gained credit from &quot;salt victims&quot; who had suffered strokes supporting her work to make large companies reduce salt. Johnson&#x27;s campaign was echoed by Food watchdogs, whilst she pushed for large food companies to make specific action plans in order to reduce salt.

In October 2003, Johnson was the subject of criticism when she was quoted as saying that fluoridation of water should be &quot;the preferred method of preventing tooth decay on a population basis&quot;. Simon Thomas accused her of suggesting people should throw away their toothbrushes, Thomas stated the proposals were &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;full of contradictions&quot;. Others such as Martyn Shrewsbury accused her of failing to consider the health risk of fluoride as well as the ethics of medicating people against their will. Johnson later clarified her comments stating &quot;we are not saying that people should stop brushing their teeth&quot;.

Johnson was defeated in the 2005 general election by Grant Shapps on a 9.2% swing to the Conservatives.

==Post parliamentary work==
In 2006 Johnson took the position of Deputy Chair on the Customer Impact Panel, an Association of British Insurers organisation dedicated to improving the customers&#x27; experience of the insurance industry.

In 2009 Johnson was named Chair of the UK Cards Association, a payments industry body, in which capacity she has attempted to have scientific research on credit card security withdrawn from public availability.

She featured on the Labour&#x27;s shortlist for the 2007 Sedgefield by-election but failed to be selected as candidate. She also made the all-female longlist for the Walthamstow seat in 2008 but was less successful and did not make the shortlist. In 2009 she made a third attempt at becoming a Labour parliamentary candidate by featuring on a controversial all-woman shortlist for the Erith and Thamesmead constituency. The contest was taken over by the central Labour party as the local party was considered incapable of handling the process fairly, leading to complaints that non local candidates were being favoured. Further controversy came when it was revealed one of the ballot boxes had been tampered with at Labour&#x27;s head office.

==Personal life==
She lives in Cambridge with her partner. They have twin daughters, and a son.

In 2001 Johnson was diagnosed with breast cancer. Despite treatment for breast cancer, it was reported that Johnson was &quot;expected to spend about 10 days recovering at home in her Welwyn and Hatfield constituency after the operation before returning to work before Christmas, the DTI said.&quot; She later commented that she had been &quot;very fortunate to make a full recovery&quot; from breast cancer.

<text>Helen Mary Jones (born 24 December 1954) is a British Labour politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Warrington North from 1997 to 2019.

Jones has served as Shadow Minister for Communities and Local Government and Shadow Home Office Minister.

==Early life==
Jones was born and brought up in Chester, the daughter of Robert Edward Jones and Mary Scanlan.

She was educated at St Werburgh&#x27;s Primary School and Ursuline Convent in Chester. She graduated with a BA from University College London and a MEd from the University of Liverpool and holds qualifications from the former Chester College and Manchester Metropolitan University.

Jones has been employed as an English teacher, a solicitor, a development officer with the mental health charity MIND and a justice and peace officer with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool.

She served on Chester City Council from 1984 to 1991. She was unsuccessful in contesting the Lancashire Central constituency at the 1984 European Parliament election and North Shropshire and Ellesmere Port and Neston at the 1983 and 1987 general elections respectively.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1997, Jones was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the &#x27;safe&#x27; Labour seat of Warrington North and won the seat with 62.1% of the vote in the general election that year.

Jones served as a member of the House of Commons select committees on Catering (1997–98), Public Administration (1998–2000) and Education and Employment (1999–2001 and 2003–). She also served on the Standing Orders Committee (1999–) and the Unopposed Bills (Panel) (1999–). She was a member of Labour Party backbench committees on Home Affairs (2002–), Education and Employment (1997–2001), Health (1997–2001) and International Development (1997–2001). She served on the all-party groups on Child Abduction (1999–2002) and CAFOD (2003–).

In 2007, Andrew Roth, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described her as an: &quot;intelligent, battle hardened leftwing solicitor built into the Labour machine&quot;. From June 2007 to October 2008, she served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Dawn Primarolo MP, Minister of State for Health. In the cabinet reshuffle of October 2008, Jones was promoted to a junior Government role in the position of Assistant Government Whip and was Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 2009 to 2010. In Opposition in the next Parliament, she became Shadow Minister for Communities and Local Government and was subsequently appointed Shadow Home Office Minister by Ed Miliband in an October 2013 reshuffle.

She stepped down from the frontbench in July 2014, stating a desire to focus on community matters and speak freely on matters such as fracking and HS2 In June 2015, she was elected to the chairmanship of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee and the chairmanship of the Petitions Select Committee.

She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. She is a member of Labour Friends of Israel. Her book, &quot;How to be a Government Whip&quot;, about her time in the Whip&#x27;s Office, was published by Biteback Publishing in 2016.

On 30 October 2019, shortly after the passage of a bill for an early general election, she announced she would not be running in the coming election, after 22 years spent representing the Warrington North Constituency.

===Constituency issues===
In November 2003, Jones accused her local ambulance service of being a &quot;shambles&quot; and criticised delays in answering 999 calls.

In early 2007, Jones criticised Scottish Power Manweb for continuing to send bills to a deceased relative&#x27;s home. She said in the Commons that &quot;Scottish Power Manweb&#x27;s policy is a blatant attempt to obtain money for electricity which has not been used.&quot;

Jones has engaged in a fierce war of words with Warrington Borough Council on numerous occasions, notably in 2007 when she obtained emails that revealed the council&#x27;s Chief Executive had explored the possibility of legal action against her following an Adjournment Debate in the Commons (where Jones had accused the council of failing to answer her letters on concerns raised by Warrington North constituents). Jones condemned the council&#x27;s threat as a &quot;waste of time and money&quot;, reminding them that any comments made in the House enjoy legal protection. She claimed that the council&#x27;s threat to sue her for defamation &quot;raised questions about the competence&quot; of council officers. Jones responded to the threat in the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; by stating: &quot;Maybe they think it will shut me up – but it won&#x27;t. I will continue to speak up for my constituents.&quot;

In 2007, Jones also made local headlines when she posed with a cardboard cut out of the council&#x27;s Chief Executive in protest at her alleged failure to tackle important community issues, including anti-social behaviour in the Orford area. She accused the council of &quot;showing disrespect&quot; to people in the north of the town and told the Warrington Guardian at the time that: &quot;Our Chief Executive appears to have gone missing.&quot;

In April 2016, a councillor called for dramatic improvements to the &#x27;poisonous&#x27; relationship between Jones and Labour party councillors.

In May and June 2019, Jones attracted criticism from local councillors who had resigned from the Labour Party.

==Personal life==
Jones employed her husband as her parliamentary assistant.

<text>Kevan David Jones, Baron Beamish, (born 25 April 1964), is a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Durham from 2001 to 2024. He has been a member of the House of Lords since 2024.

==Early life and career==
Kevan Jones was born on 25 April 1964 in Nottinghamshire and is the son of a coal miner. He attended Portland Comprehensive School in Worksop and Newcastle Polytechnic, before studying at the University of Southern Maine, gaining a BA (Hons) in Government and Public Policy. 

Before becoming an MP, he was a Newcastle upon Tyne councillor from 1990 to 2001 and Chairman of the Development Committee as well as an elected officer of the GMB Union.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 2001 general election, Jones was elected to Parliament as MP for North Durham with 67.2% of the vote and a majority of 18,683. 

After becoming an MP, Jones became a member of the influential Defence Select Committee, and also a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s Parliamentary Committee. His Private member&#x27;s bill, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004, successfully passed Parliament, and came into force in December 2004. The Act makes it illegal for large shops to open on Christmas Day.

Jones was re-elected as MP for North Durham at the 2005 general election with a decreased vote share of 64.1% and a decreased majority of 16,781.

===Ministerial career===
Jones was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Veterans at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in October 2008.

In August 2009 he was accused of briefing against the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt, who had been an outspoken critic of the government&#x27;s record on equipping troops. A series of Freedom of information requests had been made concerning Dannat&#x27;s expenses, and blogger Guido Fawkes &quot;outed&quot; Jones as the culprit, although he did not provide any evidence that directly connected Jones to the requests. Jones, who had tabled Parliamentary questions on Army officials&#x27; spending before becoming a minister, denied the allegations and said he had a good working relationship with Dannatt.

Jones publicly apologised to Joanna Lumley in March 2010 after he had accused her of &quot;deathly silence&quot; over misleading advice being given to some Gurkhas following Lumley&#x27;s successful campaign to allow more Gurkhas to settle in the UK.

In 2017, Jones said that while in office he had sought to revoke the government&#x27;s agreement with Annington Homes, by which the MoD agreed to rent back military housing sold to the company under the John Major government in 1996, while allowing the company to sell homes the armed forces no longer required, but found it impossible to do so. Jones described the arrangements as &quot;an incredibly bad deal for the taxpayer.&quot;

===In opposition===
At the 2010 general election, Jones was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 50.5% and a decreased majority of 12,076. After the election, Harriet Harman appointed Jones Shadow Minister for the Armed Forces, outside the Shadow Cabinet. He retained this position under Labour leader Ed Miliband and in Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s first appointment of shadow ministers in 2015.

Jones became a member of the special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011. He was also a member of the Public bill committee for the Defence Reform Act 2014.

At the 2015 general election, Jones was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 54.9% and an increased majority of 13,644.

In December 2015 Jones made public his strong criticism of the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, in particular after Corbyn opposed military intervention in the Syrian civil war. Jones stated &quot;because of [Corbyn&#x27;s] incompetence, the Tories are getting away with things that are not being properly scrutinised and the people who are suffering are the ones that we represent.&quot;

In January 2016, Jones resigned as a Shadow Minister for the Armed Forces, following a reshuffle in which Jeremy Corbyn had promoted Emily Thornberry, who opposes the replacement of the Trident nuclear weapon system, to shadow Defence Secretary. In his resignation letter, Jones said he believed that the country had to &quot;maintain a credible nuclear deterrent, while working to advance global nuclear disarmament.&quot;

Jones later supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

Jones supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

He is Treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Industrial Heritage. 

At the snap 2017 general election, Jones was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 59.9% and a decreased majority of 12,939.

He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

Jones was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 44.2% and a decreased majority of 4,742.

In February 2024, Jones was criticised for being &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot; during a debate in the House of Commons chamber after describing the Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing as &quot;irritating&quot;, resulting in a reprimand from Laing who was in the Speaker&#x27;s Chair. 

In May 2024, Jones announced that he would not stand again in the 2024 general election due to health issues.

===Peerage===
After standing down as an MP, Jones was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. He was created &quot;Baron Beamish, of Beamish in the County of Durham&quot;, on 15 August 2024. Instead of following the usual convention of using his surname in his title, he chose the name of Beamish, a village in his former constituency, as well as to pay tribute to Lord Lawson of Beamish, whom he described as one of his political heroes.

Jones is a campaigner for workers mistreated by the Post Office.

==Mental health==
In 2012, in a debate in Parliament on mental health issues and their &quot;taboo&quot;, Jones spoke about his experience of having depression, alongside Conservative Charles Walker, who spoke about his own 30-year experience of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Jones stated that he had had depression since 1996. Jones and Walker were both later praised for their speeches by &quot;Time to Change&quot;, a mental health anti-stigma campaign run by charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness.

In a 2015 public disagreement with Ken Livingstone regarding the Trident nuclear missile system, Livingstone told the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that Jones was &quot;obviously depressed and disturbed&quot; and &quot;should see a GP&quot;. Jones responded that the remarks &quot;belong in the dark ages&quot; and that mental health should not be used to attack political differences. Livingstone eventually apologised unreservedly.

<doc id="427378" wikidata="Q6777642" url="?curid=427378" title="Martyn Jones">
<text>Martyn David Jones (born 1 March 1947) is a former British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Clwyd South from 1987 until his retirement at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Born in Wrexham, he attended Grove Park Grammar School (now Rhosnesni High School) on &quot;Penymaes Avenue&quot; in Wrexham. He went to Liverpool College of Commerce, then completed a BSc in Microbiology at Liverpool Polytechnic, then an MSc at Trent Polytechnic.

He is a microbiologist, and worked at the Wrexham Lager Beer Company from 1969 until June 1987 before his election to the House of Commons.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1987 general election, he was elected as member of Parliament for Clwyd South West, narrowly beating the Conservative incumbent Robert Harvey. He was re-elected at the 1992 general election with an increased majority. His constituency was abolished for the 1997 election, but he was returned to Parliament for the new Clwyd South constituency where his opponent was future Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Jones was an opposition whip from 1988 to 1992, and under John Smith&#x27;s leadership of the Labour Party, he was an opposition spokesperson for Food, Agricultural and Rural Affairs from 1994 to 1995. He has been a member of the Welsh Affairs Select committee since 1997, serving as the committee&#x27;s chair until 2005. He was previously a member of the Agriculture Select Committee.

Jones has been vocal in his criticism of controversial North Wales Police Chief Constable Richard Brunstrom&#x27;s decision to use images of a dead motorcyclist as part of the force&#x27;s contentiously zealous campaign for road safety.

In 2006 &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; newspaper reported that Jones had repeatedly swore at a House of Commons Security Officer. Jones denied the &quot;Mail&quot;&#x27;s allegations. He took the paper to the High Court to sue them for inaccuracies in the story. He called the article a &quot;grotesque distortion&quot; and was eventually awarded £5,000 in compensation. The paper also had to pay £300,000 in legal costs.

Jones has been a vocal campaigner on the issue of dormant bank accounts in the UK. The MP has campaigned since 2001 for the issue to be brought to the forefront of British political life. His work on the subject was praised by senior ministers, such as the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling.

On 7 May 2009, Jones announced that he would retire at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Jones, who had once been employed by the Wrexham Lager brewery, bought the original name and building in Wrexham for £1 in 2001, in support of the brewery&#x27;s revival after closure in meantime.

<doc id="427380" wikidata="Q333721" url="?curid=427380" title="Nigel Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham">
<text>Nigel David Jones, Baron Jones of Cheltenham (30 March 1948 – 7 November 2022) was a British Liberal Democrat politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from the 1992 general election until the 2005 general election, and as a member of the House of Lords from 2005 until his death in 2022.

==Early life==
Nigel Jones was born in Cheltenham on 30 March 1948. He attended Prince Henry&#x27;s Grammar School, Evesham. After leaving school, he worked as a computer operator for Westminster Bank from 1965 to 1967, and then as a computer programmer at International Computers Limited (ICL) from 1967 to 1970. From 1970 to 1971, he worked as a systems analyst at Vehicle and General Insurance, and as a systems programmer at Atkins Computing, before he rejoined ICL as a project manager in 1971. From 1989, Jones was a councillor on Gloucestershire County Council. He resigned from both ICL and Gloucestershire County Council in 1992, when he was elected to Parliament.

==Parliamentary career==
Jones was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cheltenham as a Liberal Democrat at the 1992 general election, winning the seat from the Conservative Party. He had previously contested the seat unsuccessfully as a Liberal Party candidate at the 1979 general election.

Jones was a member of the public accounts committee from 2002 to 2005. He was also the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for a number of topics, including local government (1992–93), sport science and technology (1993), consumer affairs (1995-97), sport and culture (1997–99), trade and industry (1997–99) and international development (1999). Jones retained the seat until standing down at the 2005 general election.

==Attack and killing of Andrew Pennington==
On 28 January 2000, a man, later identified as Robert Ashman, entered Jones&#x27;s constituency office and attacked him and his assistant, local County councillor Andrew Pennington, with a katana. As a result of the attack, Pennington was killed, and Jones was severely injured. Jones required 57 stitches to close wounds to his hand from the assault.

Jones had written a character reference for Ashman when Ashman was nearly jailed after breaking the ribs of a tax collector in 1992. After the attack at Jones&#x27;s office, Ashman was charged with manslaughter and attempted murder, but the jury at his trial found him to be mentally unfit to stand trial. He was detained in Broadmoor for observation, and the Home Office authorised a further trial in September 2002. He was subsequently found guilty of attempted murder, and he admitted to Pennington&#x27;s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in 2003.

Pennington was posthumously awarded the George Medal for his attempts to protect Jones.

==Peerage==
On 13 May 2005, it was announced that Jones would be created a life peer, and he was subsequently elevated to the peerage on 20 June 2005 as Baron Jones of Cheltenham, of Cheltenham in the County of Gloucestershire. As well as many outside interests, he acted as a non-executive consultant for BFC Marcomms Ltd, a Wiltshire-based public relations consultancy.

==Personal life and death==
Jones married Katherine Grinnell in 1981 at the British Embassy, Abu Dhabi. They had a son, Sam, and twin daughters, Amy and Lucy. Jones died during heart surgery on 7 November 2022, at the age of 74.

==Arms==
==In popular culture==
In &quot;Official Secrets&quot;, a 2019 British-American docudrama film, Jones is portrayed by Chris Larkin.

<doc id="427381" wikidata="Q750364" url="?curid=427381" title="Eric Joyce">
<text>Eric Stuart Joyce (born 13 October 1960) is a Scottish politician, former military officer and convicted child sex offender. A former member of the Labour Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Falkirk, formerly Falkirk West, from 2000 to 2015.

Joining the army in his teens, Joyce served as a private in the Black Watch before attending the University of Stirling and subsequently receiving a commission in the Royal Army Educational Corps. He resigned from the army under threat of discharge in 1999 at the rank of major after being found to have broken &quot;Queen&#x27;s Regulations&quot;. He then worked as the Public Affairs Officer at the Commission for Racial Equality (Scotland).

Joyce was first elected to the British House of Commons in the 2000 Falkirk West by-election. From 2003, Joyce served as a parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to several UK government ministers. He resigned as the PPS to Bob Ainsworth on 3 September 2009, citing concerns over the war in Afghanistan. He served as Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland under Ed Miliband from June to November 2010.

Joyce was arrested five times during his last five years as an MP, most notably in February 2012 on suspicion of assault after an incident in the Houses of Parliament. This led to his immediate suspension from the Labour Party, before pleading guilty to all charges and resigning from the party the following month. He continued representing his constituency as an independent until retiring at the 2015 general election. On 7 July 2020, Joyce pleaded guilty at Ipswich Crown Court to making an indecent image of a child. On 7 August 2020, he was given a suspended prison sentence.

==Early life and education==
Joyce lived in Perth, Scotland, with his family for most of his childhood and adolescence. He joined the Army in 1978, initially as a private in the Black Watch before taking a sabbatical between 1981 and 1987 to attend technical college and university where he gained a BA (Hons) in Religious Studies from Stirling University. As a university candidate, he was made a probationary second lieutenant on 25 August 1987.

In 1987 he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst before being commissioned into the Royal Army Educational Corps (later Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps) as a subaltern with seniority to 7 October 1981. After receiving his commission he continued his studies in-service and acquired an MA in education from the University of Bath and an MBA from Keele University. During his time in the Army he served in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Germany and Central America. He was promoted to captain on 25 January 1990 and to major in 1992.

Joyce became involved in controversy after describing the Army &quot;as being run by a coterie of white, male, privately-educated generals and said it was rife with racism and sexism.&quot; A Fabian pamphlet by Joyce titled &quot;Arms and the Man: renewing the armed services&quot; had been published without the proper authorisation, breaching &quot;Queen&#x27;s Regulations&quot;, which govern the conduct of officers in the British armed forces. He continued to speak out about how he perceived the army to the disapproval of his superiors. At a hearing in January 1999 which invoked the Pay Warrant rules, Joyce was requested to resign from the army by 13 March or be discharged. He resigned his commission on 12 March 1999 and left the army,

Joyce subsequently served on the staff of the Commission for Racial Equality (Scotland) before his election to the House of Commons.

==Political career==
He was first elected to parliament at the 2000 Falkirk West by-election, which was prompted by the resignation of Dennis Canavan. On election he served as a member of the Scottish Affairs and the Procedures Select Committees at Westminster. Joyce retained his seat in the 2001 general election, and was elected to the enlarged Falkirk constituency in the 2005 general election.

From 2003 Joyce served as a parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to a number of British Government ministers. He resigned as the Parliamentary Aide to Bob Ainsworth on 3 September 2009 citing concerns over the war in Afghanistan. He had previously been PPS to John Hutton during three of Hutton&#x27;s cabinet posts: when he was the Secretary of State for Defence; Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Prior to that, Joyce served as the parliamentary aide to ministers Mike O&#x27;Brien MP, when O&#x27;Brien was the Minister for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry and Margaret Hodge MP, Minister for Industry and the Regions at the Department of Trade and Industry.

Joyce persuaded the Treasury to change the child benefit regulations to remove a discrepancy that disadvantaged young Scottish FE students relative to their peers in the rest of the UK. In April 2008, Joyce became the first European parliamentarian to be granted an opportunity to address the newly formed Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, when he visited the DRC as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on the Great Lakes Region of Africa with other members of the group. In September 2008, Joyce was criticised by local government councillors for describing the name of the new Clackmannanshire Bridge as &quot;unimaginative&quot; and &quot;parochial&quot;. The naming of the bridge was reported as a contentious matter.

Joyce edited &quot;Now&#x27;s the Hour!: new thinking for Holyrood&quot; and has served as Chair of the National Executive of the Fabian Society.

In September 2011, he contributed to the book &quot;What next for Labour? Ideas for a new Generation&quot;; his piece was entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;.

===Parliamentary record===
Joyce most often put questions in the House of Commons to the Scotland Office, Department for International Development, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Northern Ireland Office, and Ministry of Defence. While a parliamentary private secretary Joyce was expected to vote with the Government, but even when not, he never broke the Labour whip in Parliament. Joyce was not a member of any Parliamentary Select Committees at the end of his time in the Commons, but has been a member of several public bill committees.

===Expenses claims===
Joyce was the top-claiming Member of the House of Commons for the 2005–06 Parliamentary session, claiming £174,811 in expenses, of which 62% was for staff and office costs. After the 2005–06 Parliamentary session he made a public pledge to cut his expenses; during the 2006–07 session he moved down to 11th on the list of MPs&#x27; expenses and allowances, but again rose to the top for 2007–08 with £187,334. In October 2007, he claimed £180 for three oil paintings. When asked why he had used taxpayers&#x27; funds in such a way he replied &quot;because they look nice.&quot;

==Criminal record==

===Drink driving===
On 18 November 2010, he was arrested for failing to provide a breath test following a motoring incident in Falkirk. He pleaded guilty in court the following day and was fined £400 and banned from driving for a year. Joyce resigned from his position as Shadow Northern Ireland Minister and apologised for his behaviour.

===Assault===
On 22 February 2012 Joyce was arrested in the Palace of Westminster on suspicion of committing assault. He was reported to have attacked as many as six politicians, including a Labour whip, after having gone &quot;berserk&quot; following a dispute with a group of Tory MPs sitting nearby. He headbutted and punched the Conservative MP Stuart Andrew after striking Labour Assistant Whip Phil Wilson while Wilson was attempting to restrain him. He also headbutted Thurrock Conservative councillor Ben Maney and punched Basildon Conservative Councillor Luke Mackenzie, both of whom were attempting to break up the incident. Two more Conservative MPs, Alec Shelbrooke and Jackie Doyle-Price, were also caught up in the fracas while attempting to intervene and calm Joyce down. The disturbance occurred at the Strangers&#x27; Bar (reserved for MPs and their guests).

The following day Joyce was suspended from the Labour party. He pleaded guilty to four charges in relation to the incident, was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay £1,400 in compensation to his victims, but not given a custodial sentence. In a statement before the House of Commons on 12 March 2012, he apologised to his victims, stated that he had resigned from the Labour Party, and that he intended to complete his current term as an MP but not seek re-election. In August 2012, Joyce was fined £600 for removing the electronic tag that had been fitted to his leg as part of the community order.

A year later, on 14 March 2013, Joyce was again arrested after a disturbance during a karaoke event in the sports and social bar of the House of Commons. He was seen outside the bar wrestling on the floor with two police officers and reportedly had one of the officers in a headlock. He was not prosecuted.

On 17 October 2014, Joyce was arrested after clashing with a teenager at a store in Camden, in London. He was charged with two counts of common assault and one count of criminal damage. He appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates&#x27; Court in London on 30 December 2014, where he pleaded not guilty and was given conditional bail to appear for trial. On 1 May 2015, he was found guilty on two counts of common assault in an appearance at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court in London. On 27 May 2015, he was sentenced to a 10-week jail term suspended for two years, and ordered to pay a £1,080 fine and to attend a rehabilitation course which aims to reduce violent behaviour.

===Disturbance at Edinburgh Airport===
On 19 May 2013, Joyce was arrested at Edinburgh Airport after police were called to an altercation between him and airline staff regarding a mislaid mobile phone. He was reported to have struggled with police officers before being restrained on the ground and handcuffed. On 21 March 2014, he pleaded guilty to a charge of breach of the peace at Edinburgh Sheriff Court and was fined £1,500 with £150 compensation.

===Child sex offence===
On 6 November 2018, Joyce was arrested and charged with having made an indecent image of a child. He had a 51-second Category-A film on his Apple Macbook Air that showed &quot;the sexual abuse of very young children&quot; between the ages of 12 months and 7 years. The video was accessed by Joyce between August 2013 and November 2018. He was given unconditional bail. On 7 July 2020, Joyce pleaded guilty at Ipswich Crown Court to making an indecent image of a child and was ordered to sign the sex offenders&#x27; register. On 7 August 2020, he was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, and also ordered to perform 150 hours of community service.

==Personal life==
Joyce is in a long-term relationship with the writer India Knight.

<doc id="427387" wikidata="Q11001680" url="?curid=427387" title="Helen Mary Jones">
<text>Helen Mary Jones (born 29 June 1960) is a Welsh Plaid Cymru politician, who was a member of the Senedd from 1999 to 2011 and again from 2018 to 2021.

==Background==
Jones was born in Colchester, Essex. She was educated at Colchester County High School for Girls, Caereinion High School in Powys and the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where she was awarded an honours degree in history and a Postgraduate Certificate in Education. She has taught in the special education field and has held various positions in youth, community and social work.

Jones is dyslexic and dyspraxic, which she did not disclose during her time as an additional needs teacher. She told &quot;WalesOnline&quot;: &quot;I hid the problem from my colleagues, but not from the kids. I thought it might help the children if they knew that somebody who was a teacher and, in their eyes successful, had problems too.&quot;

==Political career==
Jones was the deputy leader of Plaid Cymru from 2008 to 2012. Her political interests include environmental issues, social justice, equal opportunities, children&#x27;s rights and employment.

She unsuccessfully contested the 1992 general election in Islwyn against the then leader of the Labour Party, Neil Kinnock, and the 1997 general election in Montgomeryshire. In 1999 she was elected to the new National Assembly for Wales for the constituency of Llanelli. Prior to being elected as AM for Llanelli she was Senior Development Manager with the Equal Opportunities Commission in Wales.

She was Shadow Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning, and a member of the Education and Lifelong Learning Committee, the Equality of Opportunity Committee, the South West Wales Regional Committee and also a member of the Voluntary Sector Partnership during the first term of the National Assembly.

She stood in the 2000 and 2003 Plaid Cymru leadership elections, losing to Ieuan Wyn Jones in both elections.

In the 2003 elections to the Senedd she lost her constituency seat in Llanelli by just 21 votes, but was nevertheless elected for the Mid and West Wales &quot;top-up&quot; region. She was the Shadow Minister for the Environment, Planning and Countryside in the Second Assembly (2003–07). During the 2007 elections to the Senedd she won back the Llanelli constituency with a majority of 3,884 votes. She lost her seat to Labour&#x27;s Keith Davies by 80 votes in the 2011 election.

Jones is a member of the Ministerial Advisory Board sent in to Pembrokeshire County Council by the Welsh Government to support and challenge as they improve safeguarding after damaging inspection reports.

She was elected National Chair of Plaid Cymru in September 2011. Two months later, she was appointed Chief Executive of Youth Cymru, a voluntary organisation supporting youth work in Wales. She held this position until September 2017.

In October 2014, it was announced she would be Plaid&#x27;s candidate for Llanelli at the 2016 Assembly election. In the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election, she lost to the Labour candidate Lee Waters by 382 votes.

Jones returned to the Senedd in August 2018 to represent Mid and West Wales following the resignation of Simon Thomas. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as Acting Chair of the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee, she praised efforts to continue promoting the language.

At the 2021 Senedd election, Jones was Plaid&#x27;s second candidate on the list vote for the Mid and West Wales region, but failed to gain a seat.

==Controversies==
===Suicide reference===
In March 2019, Jones said in the Senedd that if the Conservative Mark Isherwood &quot;wants more rope to hang himself with, then I&#x27;m happy to provide him with it&quot;. The statement was the subject of a formal complaint by Labour&#x27;s Jack Sargeant, whose father Carl hanged himself. Jones apologised for her words.

===Contempt of court===
On 18 February 2021, Jones was reprimanded in court for having shared a tweet from a domestic abuse campaigner, about the suspect in an ongoing murder trial, which could have influenced the jury had they seen it. The judge, who said &quot;On the face of it, it amounts to a clear contempt of court&quot;, chose not to invoke a summary procedure for contempt of court against Jones or the tweet&#x27;s original author. The Senedd&#x27;s acting standards commissioner found Jones&#x27;s actions to have breached Members&#x27; code of conduct.

===Accusations of transphobia===
Since 2018, Jones has been repeatedly accused of transphobia. In April 2018, at an event organised by the campaign group Woman&#x27;s Place UK, she questioned whether a rise in the number of &quot;women and girls wanting to transition to the opposite sex&quot; has been caused by pressure to look a certain way fuelled by social media. Following this, Youth Cymru, of which Jones was the chief executive from November 2011 until September 2017, released a statement distancing themselves from her views and saying that she was no longer associated with the organisation.

In May 2018, she tweeted, &quot;Gender critical feminists are not attacking trans people. We are asking questions.&quot; In another tweet, she said she was &quot;concerned, like many people including trans people, about the possible impacts of the proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act and the rights of women and girls&quot;. In December 2020, she shared a tweet criticising those who stated transgender people were also victims in the Holocaust and still felt discriminated against.

On 3 March 2021, Plaid Cymru member Owen Hurcum resigned as candidate for the 2021 Senedd election. Hurcum, who is non-binary and was due to be the fourth Plaid candidate on the North Wales regional list, said that they &quot;cannot in good conscious stand as a candidate for Plaid whilst they continue to platform a candidate who has promoted, and continues to promote, transphobia&quot;. Hurcum also claimed that Jones&#x27; comments and &quot;the lacklustre response from the party leadership&quot; had resulted in &quot;many members of the party [leaving] in recent months&quot;. Plaid leader Adam Price said &quot;action [had] been taken&quot; over comments made by Jones and insisted that Plaid had a &quot;very clear policy in favour of trans equality and indeed our manifesto will have the most radical commitment ever in achieving trans equality&quot;.

<text>Huai&#x27;an, formerly Huaiyin, is a prefecture-level city in central Jiangsu Province in Eastern China. As of 2020, the built-up area (metro) of its 3 central urban districts had 2,544,767 inhabitants and the prefecture-level city as a whole had 4,556,230 inhabitants, down from 4.8 million in 2010.

Long an important regional center, Huai&#x27;an lies on and is named for the Huai River, the historical boundary between Northern and Southern Chinese culture. Once much closer to the East China Sea, it now lies in the middle of Jianghuai, the vast alluvial plain created by silt from the Huai and from the Yellow River, which flowed nearby for centuries prior to the massive floods in the mid-19th century which returned it to its old course north of Shandong. Huai&#x27;an is known as the birthplace of Han Xin, a famed general who helped found the Han dynasty and overwhelm Xiang Yu in Chu-han contention; Wu Cheng&#x27;en (1500–1582), the Ming author of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;; and Zhou Enlai (1898–1976), a prominent and early Chinese Communist leader who served as premier of the PRC from 1949 until his death in 1976.

==Names==
Huai&#x27;an is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese name (&quot;Huái&#x27;ān&quot;), the name of the River Huai and the Chinese word for &quot;peaceful&quot; or &quot;pacified&quot;. The apostrophe is necessary because the second character begins with a vowel and pinyin generally avoids hyphens. The same name was previously romanized as Huai-an in Wade-Giles.

For much of the 20th century, Huai&#x27;an was officially known as Huaiyin in pinyin, Huai-yin in Wade-Giles, and Hwaiyin in Postal Map, all romanizing the Chinese name written in traditional characters and in simplified ones, meaning &quot;area on the yin, shady, or south bank of the Huai&quot;.

==Geography==
Huai&#x27;an lies on the Huai River in the alluvial Jianghuai Plain. The area is very flat with only a few notable hills in Xuyi County. The highest altitude in the municipality is . The area is notable for its large number of lakes, rivers, and canals. The Grand Canal connects with the Huai in the city. Hongze Lake, the fourth-largest freshwater lake in China, is southwest of the urban districts. Towards the south, there are also several smaller lakes. Huai&#x27;an is situated almost directly south of Lianyungang, southeast of Suqian, northwest of Yancheng, and north of Yangzhou and Nanjing in Jiangsu and northeast of Chuzhou in Anhui.

=== Climate ===
The climate in Huai&#x27;an is mild, generally warm and temperate. Winters are much drier than summers. Its Köppen climate classification is Cwa: humid subtropical climate with dry winters.

==Administration==
The prefecture-level city of Huai&#x27;an administers 7 county-level divisions, including 4 urban districts and 3 more rural counties.

These are further divided into 127 township-level divisions, including 84 towns, 33 townships, and 10 subdistricts.

==History==


===Prehistoric China===
Huai&#x27;an lies southeast of the cradle of early Chinese civilization on the Wei and Yellow Rivers. Modern Chinese archaeology has found remains from Neolithic civilizations in the area as far back as the 4th millenniumBC. The most famous of these is the Qinglianggang culture (). Traditional Chinese historiography considered the area part of the Dongyi or &quot;Eastern Barbarians&quot;, but Chinese myth sometimes extended the flood control efforts of Yu the Great to the Huai.

===Ancient China===
Under the Zhou, the area became an important agricultural center contested by the petty kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period. In 486BC, the hegemon Fuchai of Wu completed the Han or Hangou Canal &quot;Hángōu&quot;), connecting his center of power at Suzhou near the Yangtze Delta with the Huai River at Huai&#x27;an to ease his supply lines in conflicts against Qi. Increasing in commercial and strategic importance, the town also became a waypoint on the Qian and Shan Roads. During the Warring States period, the area was held in turn by Wu, Yue, and Chu before being conquered by Shi Huangdi of Qin.

===Imperial China===
Under the Qin, the area of present-day Huai&#x27;an was administered as the counties or districts of Huaiyin (with its seat at present-day Matou in Huaiyin), Xuyi, and Dongyang (with its seat at present-day Maba in Xuyi). Its people joined the rebels who overthrew the Qin, prominently including Han Xin.

Under the Han, the counties of Huaipu (with its seat in western Lianshui), Sheyang (with its seat in southeastern Huai&#x27;an), and Fulin (with its seat now under the waters of Hongze Lake) were added.

In Jian&#x27;an 5 (), near the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period, the Guangling commander Chen Dengthen subordinate to Lü Buconstructed the first 30-li section of the Gaojia Dike (, &quot;Gāojiāyàn&quot;) to minimize damage from flooding along the Huai. He also expanded the Hangou Canal westward and combined the small Fuling lakes into a single Pofu Pond to assist with irrigation.

Under the Sui, the Hangou Canal was expanded north and south to establish the Grand Canal, increasing traffic and trade through the city. Emperor Yang was also responsible for changing Pofu&#x27;s name to the present-day Hongze Lake out of his delight at rainfall there, encountered after an inspection tour through drought-afflicted areas.

During the Song, Kaifeng&#x27;s governor Du Chong &quot;Dù Chōng&quot;, d.1141) breached the levees holding back the Yellow River in 1128 as part of the ongoing wars with the Jurchen Jin further north. A series of massive floods, manmade and natural, then caused it to capture the Si River and begin flowing into the lower reaches of the Huai. The massive amounts of silt greatly expanded the farmland to the east of Huai&#x27;an but also greatly expanded Hongze Lake and caused repeated and disastrous floods despite centuries of attempts at river management by Pan Jixun and similar viceroys, often based within modern Huai&#x27;an.

The Ming Dynasty Ancestral Tomb (, &quot;Míngzǔlíng&quot;) is located in Xuyi. Now part of Huai&#x27;an, the area around it was administered as the separate Sizhou Prefecture during the Yuan, when it was the home of the family of the future Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. Although his family moved to Fengyang in present-day Anhui before his birth, he erected a large mausoleum in honor of his grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather after his establishment of the Ming. The site&#x27;s was entirely submergedalong with the entire city of Sizhouin 1680. It did not reappear above water until the early 1960s.

The original Qing Yan Garden was first built during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing.

===Modern China===
The area was occupied by the Japanese army during World War II and administered as part of Wang Jingwei&#x27;s puppet regime.

After the Japanese surrender, on 1st November 1945, the Suwan Border Region Government was established by the Communists in Huai&#x27;an. At this time the Suwan (or Su-An) Border Region extended as far as the north bank of the Yangtze River, opposite the Republican capital, Nanjing. Currently some of the buildings occupied by the Regional Government are tourist attractions in the city.

Presumably at some point, the city was recaptured by the Nationalists, because, during the closing phases of the Chinese Civil War, it fell to the Communist army in December 1948. On 21 April 1949, the area was reorganized as Huaiyin District and divided into the 10 counties of Guanyun, Huaiyin, Huaibao (western Huai&#x27;an and Baoyin with its seat at Chahe), Lianshui, Pisui (southern Pixian and northern Suining with its seat at Tushan), Shuyang, Siyang, Suining, Suqian, and Xin&#x27;an (parts of Shuyang and Suqian with its seat at Xin&#x27;an).

On 12 May 1950, Huaibao County was divided between Huaiyin County, Huai&#x27;an County in Yancheng District, and Baoyin County in Yangzhou District. On December 18 of the same year, the urban area of Huaiyin was separately organized as Qingjiang City, which became the seat for the district. Huaiyin District joined Jiangsu upon its reestablishment in January 1953. Xin&#x27;an County was renamed Xinyi and the seat of Pisui County was moved to Yunhe. Later the same year, Pisui, Suining, and Xinyi Counties were placed under the administration of Xuzhou District. Qingjiang was separately elevated to a prefecture-level city despite still being subordinate to Huaiyin District. Shortly thereafter, the district added Huai&#x27;an County from Yancheng, Sihong County from Suxian, and Xuyi County from Chuxian District in Anhui. In 1956, Hongze County was established from parts of Huaiyin, Sihong, and Xuyi Counties, with its seat at Gaoliangjian. In 1957, parts of Guanyun and Lianshui Counties were organized as the Xian&#x27;an Administrative Office, which shortly became the separate Guannan County. In 1958, Qingjiang absorbed the surrounding more rural Huaiyin County but was renamed Huaiyin City.

In 1964, Huaiyin County was again separated but kept its seat in the urban area, which again became Qingjiang. In 1966, Xuyi County was transferred to Luhe District.

In 1970, Huaiyin District became the Huaiyin Region. The next year, Xuyi was transferred back from the Luhe Region. Luhe also yielded Jinhu County. In 1975, Huaiyin County&#x27;s administration moved from Qingjiang to Wangyin.

In 1983, the Huaiyin Region became the directly administered Huaiyin City, with its urban core losing the separate name Qingjiang and being instead divided into Qinghe and Qingpu Districts. Most of the Huaiyin Region&#x27;s countiesGuannan, Huai&#x27;an, Huaiyin, Hongze, Jinhu, Lianshui, Shuyang, Sihong, Siyang, Suqian, Xuyiwere placed under the city&#x27;s administration while the lastGuanyun Countywas placed under Lianyungang. In December 1987, Huai&#x27;an and Suqian Counties were promoted to county-level cities.

In 1996, the county-level city of Suqian was promoted to prefecture-level, taking Sihong, Siyang, and Shuyang Counties along with it. Guannan County was separately placed under the administration of Lianyungang.

On 21 December 2000, the prefecture-level city of Huaiyin was renamed Huai&#x27;an. The Huaiyin County and the county-level Huai&#x27;an City became Huaiyin and Huai&#x27;an Districts and the various districts&#x27; and counties&#x27; borders slightly adjusted in different ways. In October 2016, Qinghe and Qingpu reunited to form the city&#x27;s current Qingjiangpu District.

==Culture==
The people of Huai&#x27;an are generally ethnically Han Chinese. The local culture is known as &quot;Jianghuai&quot;, referring to its position between the Huai River and the Yangtze, long known poetically in China as simply &quot;The River&quot; (, &quot;Jiāng&quot;). The local dialect is a form of Jianghuai or Lower Yangtze Mandarin. Similarly, the local cuisine is Jianghuai or Huaiyang cuisine, historically considered one of the four chief styles of true Chinese cooking.

==Sports==
The Huai&#x27;an City Sports Stadium is a football stadium with a capacity of 30,000.

==Transportation==
Huai&#x27;an is served by the Xinyi-Changxing railway, which has a station in Huaiyin District.

Being at the intersection of the Grand Canal and Huai River Huai&#x27;an is an important inland port.

The city is also served by nearby Huai&#x27;an Lianshui International Airport. Currently the airport is served by China Eastern Airlines, which offers flights to Beijing-Capital, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai-Hongqiao, Shanghai-Pudong, Wenzhou, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Xi&#x27;an. Several other airlines offer domestic flights to cities such as Nanning and Zhengzhou. The airport is located from central Huai&#x27;an in Lianshui county.

Public transportation includes a tram system that connects the city center with the southeastern side of the city.

<text>Samuel Heinrich Schwabe (25 October 1789 – 11 April 1875) was a German amateur astronomer remembered for his work on sunspots. He observed sunspots and made drawings of them from 1825 to 1867 and suggested in 1838 that there may be a ten-year cycle of sunspot activity. He also took an interest in botany and was a founding member of a natural history society in Dessau.

== Life and work ==
Schwabe was born in Dessau, Germany, where his father was a physician to the duke. His mother was the daughter of apothecary Johann H. G. Häseler (1740-1812) and he too trained to be one in 1806 by joining the Dessau Mohrenapotheke owned by Häseler. After about three years he began to study at the University of Berlin training in pharmacy under Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Sigismund Friedrich Hermbstädt. He also took an interest in astronomy and botany and was forced to stop studies when his grandfather Häseler fell ill. After the death of Häseler in 1812, Schwabe was forced to take over the family pharmacy business and the family became prosperous. He spent his spare time in scientific pursuits but it was only after selling off the business that he began to attend to scientific activities fulltime.

Schwabe obtained his first telescope through a lottery in 1825 and began his observations on sunspots from 30 October 1825. In 1826 he obtained a better telescope, a 4.8-in. Fraunhofer refractor that was used by Wilhelm Lohrmann to map the Moon. From 1829 he was completely involved in scientific work. Schwabe was looking for a theoretical planet inside the orbit of Mercury, known as Vulcan. Because of the proximity to the Sun, it would have been very difficult to observe such a planet, and Schwabe believed one possibility to detect a new planet might be to see it during its transit in front of the Sun. For 17 years, from 1826 to 1843, on every clear day, Schwabe would scan the Sun and record its spots trying to detect any new planet among them. He kept notes but was not interested in publishing his results. His first note was a letter to Heinrich Schumacher which was published in &quot;Astronomical Nachrichten&quot; (no. 495). Although he did not find any planet transiting the solar disc he noticed the regular variation in the number of sunspots and published his findings in a short article entitled &quot;Solar Observations during 1843&quot;. In it he made the suggestion of a probable ten-year period (i.e. that at every tenth year the number of spots reached a maximum). This paper at first attracted little attention, but Rudolf Wolf who was at that time the director of Bern observatory, was impressed so he began regular observations of sunspots. Schwabe&#x27;s observations were afterwards utilized in 1850 by Alexander von Humboldt in the third volume of his &quot;Kosmos&quot;. The periodicity of sunspots is now fully recognized; and to Schwabe is thus due the credit of one of the most important discoveries in astronomy. Data from his notes and 8486 drawings has been digitized and analyzed. They have helped fill in gaps in the data collected by Rudolf Wolf from 1848. Schwabe also made observations of the Great Red Spot of Jupiter and made notes of it in 1831 although these were only noticed and published in 1899.

Schwabe was involved in founding a natural history society in Dessau where he served as its president. He contributed many mineral specimens to the collections of the society. In 1838 and 1839 he published his notes on botany in two volumes under the title &quot;Flora Anhaltina&quot;, describing nearly 2000 plant species.

In 1857 Schwabe was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. The medal was presented by Richard Carrington in Dessau and the honor influenced Schwabe to bequeath his notes to the Royal Astronomical Society which elected him as a member in 1868.

<text>An internally displaced person (IDP) is someone who is forced to leave their home but who remains within their country&#x27;s borders. They are often referred to as refugees, although they do not fall within the legal definitions of a refugee.

In 2022, it was estimated there were 70.5 million IDPs worldwide. The first year for which global statistics on IDPs are available was in 1989. the countries with the largest IDP populations were Ukraine (8 million), Syria (7.6 million), Ethiopia (5.5 million), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5.2 million), Colombia (4.9 million), Yemen (4.3 million), Afghanistan (3.8 million), Iraq (3.6 million), Sudan (2.2 million), South Sudan (1.9 million), Pakistan (1.4 million), Nigeria (1.2 million) and Somalia (1.1 million). More than 85% of Palestinians in Gaza (1.9 million) were internally displaced as of January 2024.

The United Nations and the UNHCR support monitoring and analysis of worldwide IDPs through the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.

==Definition==
Whereas &#x27;refugee&#x27; has an authoritative definition under the 1951 Refugee Convention, there is no universal legal definition of internally displaced persons (IDP); only a regional treaty for African countries (see Kampala Convention). However, a United Nations report, &quot;Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement&quot; uses the definition of: 
persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.

While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement (coercion and the domestic/internal movement), rather than a strict definition the Guiding Principles offer &quot;a descriptive identification of the category of persons whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles&quot;. In this way, the document &quot;intentionally steers toward flexibility rather than legal precision&quot; as the words &quot;in particular&quot; indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, &quot;global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence.&quot; This outlook has become outdated, however, as natural disasters and slow-onset climate degradation have become the primary driving force behind internal displacement in recent years, although conflict remains the primary reason for pre-existing IDPs overall. Climate displaced IDPs are therefore being given more attention overall through being recorded in statistics. Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons for internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but the name is often applied to IDPs.

==IDP populations==
It is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations are not constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, and others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary for many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground. Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate. Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters. Development-induced IDPs often are not included in assessments. It has been estimated that between 70 and 80% of all IDPs are women and children.

50% of internally displaced people and refugees were thought to be in urban areas in 2010, many of them in protracted displacement with little likelihood of ever returning home. A 2013 study found that these protracted urban displacements had not been given due weight by international aid and governance as historically they had focused on rural cam displacement responses. The study argues that this protracted urban displacement needs a fundamental change in the approach to those who are displaced and their host societies. They note that re-framing responses to urban displacement will also involve human rights and development actors and local and national governments. They call for a change in the narrative around the issue is needed to reflect ingenuity and fortitude displayed by displaced populations, the opportunities for self-sufficiency and safety represented by urban areas, and that the displaced can make a contribution to their host societies. An updated country by country breakdown can be found online.

=== Latest IDP population ===
The following table is a list of countries and territories by the number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs). According to Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), the internal displacement figures refer to the number of forced movements of people within the borders of their country recorded during the year, and may include individuals who have been displaced more than once. The total number of IDPs is a snapshot of all the people living in internal displacements at the end of the year, and is the sum of the number of conflict IDPs and disaster IDPs.

==Protection and assistance==
The problem of protecting and assisting IDPs is not a new issue. In international law it is the responsibility of the government concerned to provide assistance and protection for the IDPs in their country. However, as many of the displaced are a result of civil conflict and violence or where the authority of the central state is in doubt, there is no local authority willing to provide assistance and protection. It has been estimated that some 5 million IDPs in 11 countries are &quot;without any significant humanitarian assistance from their governments.&quot; Under these circumstances rehabilitation policies on humanitarian grounds should be aimed at reducing inequality of opportunity among these vulnerable groups by integrating them into local social services and allowing them access to jobs, education, and healthcare opportunities; otherwise new conflicts might break out.

Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international humanitarian institution which has the overall responsibility of protecting and assisting the refugees as well as the internally displaced. A number of organizations have stepped into the breach in specific circumstances.

===UNHCR===
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was mandated by General Assembly Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950 to &quot;lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems... guided by the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.&quot; The UNHCR has traditionally argued that it does not have an exclusive mandate for IDPs even though at least since 1972 it had relief and rehabilitation programs for those displaced within a country. Until the mid-2000s, it conditioned involvement to cases where there is a specific request by the UN Secretary-General and with the consent of the State concerned it has been willing to respond by assisting IDPs in a given instance. In 2005 it was helping some 5.6 million IDPs (out of over 25 million), but only about 1.1 million in Africa.

In 2005, the UNHCR signed an agreement with other humanitarian agencies. &quot;Under this agreement, UNHCR will assume the lead responsibility for protection, emergency shelter and camp management for internally displaced people.&quot; In 2019, UNHCR issued an updated IDP policy that reaffirms its commitment to engaging decisively and predictably in situations of internal displacement.

===ICRC===
The International Committee of the Red Cross has a mandate of ensuring the application of international humanitarian law as it affects civilians in the midst of armed conflict. They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes. In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: 
The ICRC&#x27;s overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations. On the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.
However, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs &quot;deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs.&quot;

===Collaborative approach===
The previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, Unicef, WFP, UNDP, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the ICRC and international NGOs. Coordination is the responsibility of the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Humanitarian Coordinator in the country concerned. They are assisted by the Inter-Agency Displacement Division, which was created in 2004 and is housed in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

The original collaborative approach has come under increasing criticism. Roberta Cohen reports: 
Nearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting... There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests. In every new emergency, no one knows for sure which agency or combination thereof will become involved.In 2005 there was an attempt to fix the problem by giving sectoral responsibilities to different humanitarian agencies, most notably with the UNHCR taking on the responsibility for the protection and the management of camps and emergency shelters. The &quot;Forced Migration Review&quot; stated that the &quot;abnegation of responsibility is possible because there is no formal responsibility apportioned to agencies under the Collaborative Response, and thus no accountability when agencies renege on their promises.&quot;

Similarly, research on refugees has suggested a cross-sector collaboration as a key means to assist displaced people.

==Cluster approach==

The cluster approach designates individual agencies as &#x27;sector leaders&#x27; to coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening the leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of &quot;clusters&quot; at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)&#x27;.

The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key &#x27;gap&#x27; areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as &quot;providers of last resort&quot;, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.

The clusters were originally concentrated in nine areas: 
# Logistics (WFP)
# Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (WFP)
#Camp Coordination and Camp Management (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs and IOM for natural disaster-generated IDPs)
# Shelter (IFRC for natural disasters; UNHCR for conflict situations)
# Health (WHO)
# Nutrition (UNICEF)
# Water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion (UNICEF)
# Early recovery (UNDP); and
# Protection (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs, UNHCR, UNICEF, and OHCHR for natural disaster-generated IDPs).

IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.

The original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.

==International law==
Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see Kampala Convention). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition. Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed Francis Deng in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons. Besides acting as an advocate for IDPs, Deng set out in 1994, at the request of the UN General Assembly to examine and bring together existing international laws which relate to the protection of IDPs. The result of this work was the document, &quot;Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement&quot;.

The Guiding Principles lay out the responsibilities of states before displacement – that is, to prevent displacement – during and after displacement. They have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly, the African Commission on Human and People&#x27;s Rights (ACHPR) and by the signatories to the 2006 Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region, which include Sudan, DRC and Uganda.

The Guiding Principles, however, are non-binding. As Bahame Tom Nyanduga, Special Rapporteur on Refugees, IDPs and Asylum Seekers in Africa for the ACHPR has stated, &quot;the absence of a binding international legal regime on internal displacement is a grave lacuna in international law.&quot;

In September 2004 the Secretary-General of the UN showed the continuing concern of his office by appointing Walter Kälin as his Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. Part of his mandate includes the promoting of the Guiding Principles.

== Right of return ==
In so-called &quot;post-conflict&quot; situations, there has traditionally been an emphasis in the international community to seek to return to the pre-war status quo. However, opinions are gradually changing, because violent conflict destroys political, economic and social structures and new structures develop as a result, quite often irreversibly. Furthermore, returning to the pre-war status-quo may actually be undesirable if pre-war structures led to the conflict in the first place, or prevented its early resolution. IDPs&#x27; and refugees&#x27; right of return can represent one of the most complex aspects of this issue.

Normally, pressure is applied by the international community and humanitarian organization to ensure displaced people are able to return to their areas of origin and the same property. The UN Principles for Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and IDPs, otherwise known as the Pinheiro Principles, provides guidance on the management of the technical and legal aspects of housing, land and property (HLP) restitution. Restitution rights are of key importance to IDPs and refugees around the world, and important to try preventing aggressors benefiting from conflict. However, without a clear understanding of each local context, full restitution rights can be unworkable and fail to protect the people it is designed to protect for the following reasons, refugees and IDPs:
* may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);
* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);
* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;
* death of the owner may leave dependents without a clear claim to the land;
* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and
* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan)

Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute stress the need for humanitarian organization to develop greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have knowledge in both humanitarian and land and property issues and so provide better advice to state actors seeking to resolve these issues. The ODI calls on humanitarian agencies to develop an awareness of sustainable reintegration as part of their emphasis on returning IDPs and refugees home. Legal advice needs to be provided to all parties involved even if a framework is created in which to resolve these issues.

<doc id="427411" wikidata="Q561177" url="?curid=427411" title="Kriangsak Chamanan">
<text>Kriangsak Chamanan (, ; 17 December 191723 December 2003) served as prime minister of Thailand from 1977 to 1980. After staging a successful coup, he was asked to become Prime Minister in 1977. He ruled till 1980 and is credited with &quot;steering Thailand to democracy&quot; in a time where communist insurgents were rampant internally and neighbouring countries turned to communist rule following the communist takeover of Vietnam: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the Khmer Rouge).

Regarded as one of the most notable statesmen in modern Thailand, his landmark developmental policies include the founding of Eastern Seaboard through the founding of PTT, facilitating the building of a deep-sea port in Laem Chabang and negotiating for bilateral trade agreements between Thailand and Japan through Takeo Fukuda to include Thailand in the flying geese paradigm. Chomanan founded the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, transforming it into PTT in a merger between three fragmented state-owned energy companies, serving as a major economic and industrial stimulus in the rise of Thailand secondary production economy in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, the founding of PTT also served to lessen the reliance on the global energy market, which was affected by a severe global oil price crisis in the 1970s. His other notable works include the founding of the Chatuchak Market which also helped to solve the Din Daeng Garbage Mountain issue, the Village Health Volunteers organization which acts as a crucial model in Thailand public primary care, the founding of the Ministry of Science and Technology, the passing of the first-ever bills to include tourism in the government economic development plans and the upgrading of the Tourism Authority of Thailand from organizational level to state level, the passing of the current consumer protection acts and organizations and the founding of Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. After his time in office, he was invited to the InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government in solving various global issues, becoming the only Thai prime minister until now and one of fewer than three from Asia at the time of his membership.

A professional soldier, in WWII he was posted in occupied Shan State. He fought against the French in the Franco-Thai War from 1940–43, serving as platoon leader, and against the communists in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In Korea, he served as commander of Infantry Battalion III which fought in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, from which he was one of only a few of the non-citizen officers to receive the Legion of Merit. After the Korean War, Chomanan joined the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, where he is the only Thai person to be included in the Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame. He&#x27;s also the only Thai coup leader to make an official visit to Washington where he was welcomed to the White House in 1979 by then-president Jimmy Carter, in contrast to previous leaders honoured in states distant from Washington.

Kriangsak died on 23 December 2003, aged 86. He was survived by his wife Khun Ying (Lady) Virat Chomanan, son Major General Pongpipat Chomanan and daughter Ratanawan.

== Early life and career ==
Kriangsak Chamanan was born on 17 December 1917 in Mahachai Subdistrict, Mueang Samut Sakhon District, Samut Sakhon Province, a prominent Chinese trading port to the southwest of Bangkok. He was born to a wealthy business family that ran the Mahachai trading company, which dealt in importing and exporting goods between Thailand and the West and Japan. Mahachai in the 1800s and 1900s was one of Thailand&#x27;s largest trading ports and grew to become the first city district with its own local government in 1897.

=== Education ===
From age six to twelve, Kriangsak attended Samut Sakhon Wittayalai and later Patumkongka School. After graduating from primary school, Kriangsak moved to Bangkok to attend the prestigious Amnuay Silpa School (Its alumni include six prime ministers of Thailand) where he excelled academically.

He later attended Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy (, , abbreviated as รร.จปร.), known for its intense training program and one of the lowest admission rates among learning institutions in Thailand, until he graduated in 1938. During his time in the army, he further attended the Thai Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) and the Thailand National Defence College.

After his time in the Korean War, he also got a scholarship to attend the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a graduate school for United States Army and sister service officers, interagency representatives, and international military officers.

== Military career ==
Kriangsak fought in the Korean War as a commander of the Thai Army in the 21st Infantry Regiment, which earned the nickname &quot;Little Tigers&quot; for their valour. He showed exemplary skills as a major, playing a pivotal role in defending Pork Chop Hill. On 15 March 1953, by direction of the US president and under the provision of the 1942 Act of the US Congress, then-lieutenant Kriangsak became one among few non-U.S. military personnel to be awarded the Legion of Merit (Officer degree) for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services.

He became a full general in 1973, and army chief of staff a year later. In 1974, he also secretly brokered a prisoner exchange with the Burmese government, in which the opium warlord Khun Sa was ransomed for the freedom of two Soviet doctors whom Khun Sa&#x27;s followers had kidnapped.

In 1977, Kriangsak was part of the National Administrative Reform Council (NARC), which staged a successful coup d&#x27;état against Prime Minister Thanin Kraivichien. Thanin himself had come into power the year before, after another coup by Sangad Chaloryu suspended the constitutional monarchy. The NARC was composed entirely of what contemporaneous press reports characterised as moderate military leaders, not from the extreme right wing. It was distinguished from previous military ruling groups &quot;as an effort to institutionalize power relationships within the military in contrast to the personal factions and cliques which entered the political arena in the past.&quot; Kriangsak was then asked to become prime minister, partially against his will according to his wife Khunying Virat Chomanan.

=== Coup d&#x27;état and ascension ===

Prior to Kraingsak, the Thanin Kraivichien administration had spiraled the country into a perilous state of civil war. Incidents involving the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) in rural areas across Thailand and border clashes with Cambodia and Laos incidents were becoming increasingly frequent. The administration&#x27;s forceful suppressive policy had the perverse effect of increasing the CPT&#x27;s popularity. Furthermore, members and close aides of the royal family also became targets of attacks by the communist insurgents, including the assassination of the queen&#x27;s secretary and a bomb explosion near the king while he was visiting the south of Thailand. The country-wide deterioration and increased activity of communist insurgents induced reactions within the Thai armed forces. The first attempt to overthrow the Thanin administration took place in March 1977 and was led by General Chalad Hiranyasiri. However, it was unsuccessful and Chalad was executed on Thanin&#x27;s order. With increasing unrest, the Thanin government was finally successfully overthrown on 20 October 1977 when a clique of Thai military officers known as the Young Turks pressured Kriangsak and General Sangad Chaloyu, who had led the 1976 coup that ousted the elected civilian government of Seni Pramoj and appointed the royal favorite Thanin as prime minister. Kriangsak was later appointed the new prime minister by a majority vote through both the National Assembly and the NARC.

As prime minister, Kriangsak moved to moderate and neutralize his predecessor Thanin&#x27;s severe measures, which had driven young Thai intellectuals from multiple universities to join the communist insurgency in the countryside. In 1978, in a major risk to his political position with his right leaning supporting base, he submitted an amnesty bill to the National Legislative Assembly to release the Bangkok 18, a group of leftist students and labor activist jailed after the Thammasat University massacre that preceded the 1976 coup. The move greatly bolstered his international position as a Southeast Asian humanitarian leader and was noted in commemorations from many international bodies. He also started a successful amnesty program for communists as part of a reconciliation policy.

Kriangsak is widely credited with defusing the long-running communist insurgency in northern Thailand. He was reported to have met in 1979 with Deng Xiaoping, then supreme leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, allowing China to ship arms to the rebel Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in exchange for the PRC withdrawing its support for the communist insurgency in Thailand. These reports were confirmed contemporaneously by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and wire services. However, claims of a deal involving the Khmer Rouge was denied by the Thai government, which cites his policy of reunification and offers of amnesty as the primary reason for the decline of the communist insurgency. The other benefit of the deal with China for Thailand was that it would not have Vietnamese troops on its border. In the same way Kriangsak had secret deals with rebel armies across the border in Burma, which provided a buffer zone against Burmese aggression.

=== International relations and foreign policy ===
One of Kriangsak&#x27;s main accomplishments was normalising and improving foreign relations. He led rapprochements towards the neighboring countries of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Vietnam, and Myanmar (known as the CLMV countries) and fostered closer relationships with Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. Moreover, he was one of the few leaders of a non-communist country to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union and to have fostered diplomatic relationships with both countries. Kriangsak visited Beijing in late March 1978. PRC leader Deng Xiaoping returned the favour in November 1978 and in a significant public moment visited Kriangsak&#x27;s private house and discussed political issues both on national television and privately.

In April 1975, Thailand was the first country in Southeast Asia to recognize the communist Khmer Rouge regime in Phnom Penh. In October the two countries agreed in principle to resume diplomatic and economic relations; the agreement was formalized in June 1976, when they also agreed to erect border markers in poorly defined border areas.

Meanwhile, the withdrawal of all American troops from Thailand by July 1976 paved the way for the Thai-Vietnamese agreement on normalizing relations in August. In January 1978, Bangkok and Hanoi signed an accord on trade and economic and technical cooperation, agreeing also to exchange ambassadors, reopen aviation links, resolve all problems through negotiations, and consult on the question of delimiting sea boundaries. Progress toward improved relations with the Indochinese states came to an abrupt halt, however, after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, and in January 1979 installed in Phnom Penh a new communist regime friendly to Hanoi. This invasion not only provoked a Chinese attack on Vietnam in February 1979 but also posed a threat to Thailand&#x27;s security. Kriangsak could no longer rely on Cambodia as a buffer against Vietnamese power. Bangkok was forced to assume the role of a frontline state against a resurgent communist Vietnam, which had 300,000 troops in Cambodia and Laos. The Kriangsak government began increasing its defense capabilities. While visiting Washington in February 1979, Kriangsak asked for and received reassurances of military support from the United States. His government also launched a major diplomatic offensive to press for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from Cambodia and for continued international recognition of Democratic Kampuchea under Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge regime. As part of that offensive, Kriangsak also journeyed to Moscow in March 1979, the first visit ever by a Thai prime minister, to explain the Thai position on the Cambodian question and to reassure the Soviets that Thailand&#x27;s anti-Vietnamese position was neither anti-Soviet nor pro-Chinese. Such reassurances were believed to be necessary in view of Vietnamese accusations that Thailand collaborated with China and the United States in aiding and abetting the Khmer Rouge forces against the Heng Samrin regime.

The Thai offensive, backed by Bangkok&#x27;s ASEAN partners, was rewarded in a United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution adopted in November 1979. The resolution called for immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cambodia, asked all nations to refrain from interfering in, or staging acts of aggression against, Cambodia, and called on the UN secretary general to explore the possibility of an international conference on Cambodia.
Kriangsak also made significant economic deals with regional neighbors. When the Malaysian prime minister Tun Hussein Onn arrived in Thailand to sign an oil treaty over drilling rights along the Thai-Malaysian border and in the Gulf of Thailand, both flew to the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai to sign the pact. While in a convoy on the way from the Chiang Mai Airport, Kriangsak ordered his limousine to stop and took Tun Hussein to a noodle shop to enjoy the &quot;best beef noodles in Thailand&quot;. When Hussein became agitated about being late for the signing, Kriangsak reportedly took out the agreement and signed it on the spot, asking his guest: &quot;Now would you care for some more noodles?&quot;

Despite taking power in a military coup, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; report that Kriangsak was known for leaning towards democracy. He enlisted more civilians to top jobs than any previous regime, granted amnesty to communists and dissidents who were jailed for fighting a military crackdown in 1976, promulgated the country&#x27;s 12th constitution, and set up a timetable for full parliamentary democracy in 1979. But this democratic step reportedly cost him the support of the military.

==== Relations with the United States of America ====
Prior to Kriangsak&#x27;s time in office, with America clearly in retreat from military involvement on the Southeast Asian mainland, Thai self-preservation dictated a policy of realignment. Within days of the congressional cutoff of American bombing in Cambodia in August 1973, the U.S. and Thai governments announced the first drawdown of U.S. personnel in Thailand. The fall of the regime of Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien on 15 October 1973, added further impetus, because the student protestors, who had sparked the revolt, demanded, among other things, a more independent foreign policy for Thailand, including the removal of American bases.

In May 1974, U.S. forces in Thailand were cut to 34,000 (compared with a wartime high of 50,000 in December 1972), and statements by Thai officials clearly indicated an inclination toward complete U.S. military withdrawal. Concurrently, Thailand sought to add balance to its diplomacy by improving relations with Hanoi and Moscow. Diplomatic recognition was extended to Romania, Outer Mongolia, and Czechoslovakia, a North Korean trade delegation visited Bangkok, and relations with China continued to warm. During 1973-1976, a consensus developed within the Thai foreign policy elite, favoring decreased reliance upon the United States and returning to a more traditional Thai stance of establishing cordial relations with as many contending powers as possible as the most efficacious means of protecting Thailand&#x27;s sovereignty.

The governments of both Seni Promoj and Kukrit Pramoj sought complete withdrawal of American bases, improved relations with North Vietnam, and diplomatic relations with China. In late March 1975, the Thai government decided to cut the lifeline of the Lon Nol regime by stating that the U.S. government &quot;had no right&quot; to transship ammunition through Thailand. As the April denouement approached in Vietnam and Cambodia, Thailand&#x27;s survival instincts dictated increased public resistance to U.S. security policies in Indochina. American policymakers in the immediate aftermath of Saigon&#x27;s fall made public statements indicating that previous commitments to the defense of Thailand might no longer be binding. When Secretary of Defense Schlesinger was asked whether the U.S. would continue to be obligated to defend Thailand from external attack, he replied: &quot;[I] would have to consult my lawyers.&quot; Furthermore, Secretary Kissinger omitted Thailand from a listing of defense commitments in Asia. High American officials seemed to be publicly undermining what little deterrent value remained in the U.S.–Thai security relationship. Perhaps the absolute nadir in U.S.–Thai security relations was reached in the closing days of 1975, when Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield urged the abrogation of the Manila Treaty as well as closing out American economic aid to Thailand. In June 1975, former Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman clearly elucidated the new policies to be followed by Thailand in disengaging from the U.S.-Thai alliance: &quot;The present government is committed to following a policy of equidistance—Thailand should try to keep on the best possible terms with major powers—the U.S., Soviet Union, China, Japan, Western and Eastern Europe. If we allow one power to station troops here, we may get into trouble with another large power, or one of the smaller powers. It was not my personal feelings, but the resolution of the American Congress banning U.S. forces from taking part in overseas operations. If they can&#x27;t perform military duties why are they here? As tourists? It doesn&#x27;t make sense. We have seen the sad situation in South Vietnam and Cambodia of the U.S. Congress refusing credits to those countries. Executive agreements are completely meaningless if Congress is not willing to go ahead. What are promises worth if we are unsure of the position of the [American] legislative branch? If the U.S. Congress was to pass a resolution tomorrow that if Thailand were attacked the U.S. would join Thailand&#x27;s defense, I would be the first to advocate that American forces remain. At present, however, they are a liability.&quot;The year 1976 was dominated by the final withdrawal of American forces from the bases in Thailand. There was a feeble American attempt to maintain a residual force, but this was rejected with a certain amount of political fanfare by Kukrit Pramoj. The U.S. response to the Thai government announcement on 20 March that U.S. military activity in Thailand must end &quot;forthwith&quot; was a forthright &quot;We don&#x27;t stay where we are not wanted.&quot; In the period 1973–1976, Thailand had rapidly readjusted its pattern of international relations: moving away from the U.S. (but without dissolving the relationship entirely); moving toward China (but without becoming a client); and seeking outright accommodation with Hanoi along with limited advances toward the Soviet Union.

The policy of moving away from dependence on the United States gradually eliminated American involvement in Thai politics. But when Thanin took over, his policy of suppressing communist activities within Thailand and limiting external communist expansion toward Thailand&#x27;s borders encouraged a new series of American involvements. Yet, even though the policies of the two countries coincided, the American involvement in Thailand during this period did not quite reach the same high level as in the previous period. In 1977, SEATO was dissolved and the U.S. cut back its aid programs to Thailand.

Kriangsak came to power in November 1977 and quickly adopted a new and actively independent foreign policy, compared to Thanin&#x27;s rigid stance. He travelled extensively, visiting the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union, in addition to the United States. With his own unique style of &quot;survival diplomacy,&quot; Kriangsak tried to reestablish more balanced relations with the rest of the world. However, he also succeeded to a certain extent in convincing the U.S. government of Thailand&#x27;s strategic importance and persuaded the U.S. to adopt a more &quot;credible&quot; policy toward Thailand. It was becoming apparent that it was in the interest of the United States to help Thailand and ASEAN develop and that bilaterally, the United States could afford to improve close relations with Thailand while playing an important role in encouraging indigenous regionalism capable of coping with political and security problems.

Toward the end of his premiership, Kriangsak was able to restore close and friendly relations with the United States. Although anti-Americanism still existed, it was at a low level, compared to what it had been during the Thanom-Prapas period.

==== Relations with neighboring states ====
Kriangsak&#x27;s position toward Vietnam following the December 1978 invasion of Cambodia was remarkably steadfast and obscures the fact that Thai foreign policy in 1973–1978 was based on diplomatic flexibility and accommodation with Hanoi and Phnom Penh. This basic policy was present even during the stridently anti-communist government of Thanin Kraivichien (October 1976–October 1977). Immediately after the October 1976 coup, which reasserted the military&#x27;s role in Thai politics. Kriangsak, as secretary-general of the National Administrative Reform Council, reiterated the policy of détente: &quot;We want good relations with Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia&quot; and &quot;our policy towards China has not changed.&quot; Clashes with the Khmer Rouge occurred repeatedly along the border, as the Khmer Rouge involved themselves in border conflicts with Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand simultaneously. Thai policy in responding to the Khmer Rouge differed markedly from Vietnamese responses to similar incidents. Whereas the Thais never ceased protesting the frequent border violations, Thailand nevertheless continued its pursuit of a diplomatic solution. In contrast, the Vietnamese response to Khmer Rouge activity was entirely military: escalation and counterstrikes by both sides led eventually to full-scale war and invasion. Thailand, especially under Kriangsak, calculated that the most serious threat to Democratic Kampuchea came from Vietnam and that the Khmer Rouge must eventually come to terms with Thailand if they were to have any chance whatever of survival. In response to a series of raids across the Thai border, he stated that the Thai government would accelerate its efforts to establish better relations with Cambodia. Bangkok even provided possible rationales for the border violations. such as confusion and poor communication between the border area and Phnom Penh, or, alternately, inaccurate maps. Thailand went out of its way to play down the border incidents. As Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea engaged in conflict, both antagonists sought better relations with Thailand. Military security along the Thai–Cambodian border improved slowly after Thai Foreign Minister Upadit Pachariyangkun&#x27;s &quot;goodwill visit&quot; to Phnom Penh in late January 1978, which resulted in an agreement to exchange ambassadors. During 1978, Thailand displayed an ability to fine-tune its foreign policy; even while the border raids into its territory continued in February, government spokesmen reiterated the contention that the border situation had improved. When fifty Thais were killed, Thailand sent a &quot;report&quot; rather than a &quot;protest&quot; note, because &quot;Cambodian leaders might not know what is happening on the border.&quot;

Kriangsak also strengthened relations with the United States, and was warmly received in his first state visit to the White House with U.S. President Jimmy Carter on 6 February 1979. According to the internal talking points prepared for Carter, the President cited the close historical relations as well as economic and regional cooperation in Southeast Asia.

=== Honorable resignation ===
Kriangsak voluntarily resigned in February 1980, telling parliament that he no longer felt he had the support of the public. He was the first and only leader of a coup in Thailand ever to resign voluntarily, and was celebrated for his decision, often cited in comparison to many of Thailand&#x27;s past military governments. It was reported that the primary cause for his loss of support was rising prices, particularly of oil, electricity and other commodities. &quot;I have decided to resign the prime ministership so that democracy can be maintained,&quot; Kriangsak told a special session of parliament, which had gathered to debate his governments policies before a vote of confidence. He said his intention was &quot;to open the way for other capable people to administer the country.&quot;

He was succeeded by General Prem Tinsulanonda, his former longtime aide. In 1981 he re-entered politics at the head of a new political party, the National Democratic Party, which emerged as the only credible political opposition to Prem.

=== The case of the Cambodian refugees ===
Large influxes of Cambodian refugees took place between 1979 and 1980, after Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia and installed the Heng Samrin regime in place of Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge in December 1978. Fleeing the devastating war, starvation and disease, 200,000 Cambodian refugees were estimated to be on the border attempting to enter Thailand. On 18 October 1979, Kriangsak visited the Thai–Cambodian border. Two days later, taking a major political risk, he altered the government&#x27;s policy towards the refugees, declaring a new &quot;open door&quot; policy granting temporary asylum to Cambodian refugees. Thailand would still not recognize them as refugees but placed them in &quot;holding centers&quot;. On 22 October, a Thai colonel contacted UNHCR and said that the Kriangsak government had decided to additionally admit 90,000 Cambodians who were situated on the border. The Thai military planned to begin relocating them to a site near the town of Sa Kaeo within two days. Sa Kaeo Holding Center was about 64 kilometres west of the border near the town of Sa Kaeo and 209 kilometres by road from east of Bangkok.

==== Refoulement of Cambodian refugees ====
Also during Kriangsak&#x27;s premiership, it was speculated by an official that Thailand&#x27;s government carried out the forcible repatriation of up to 45,000 Cambodian refugees who were forcibly expelled from the country by having them walk down a steep slope and over a minefield in one of the worst refoulements in history with over 3000 refugees dying in the process and those that refused claimed to be shot by Thai soldiers.

<doc id="427412" wikidata="Q152027" url="?curid=427412" title="Saint-Nazaire">
<text>Saint-Nazaire (; ; ) is a commune in the Loire-Atlantique department in western France, in traditional Brittany.

The town has a major harbour on the right bank of the Loire estuary, near the Atlantic Ocean. The town is at the south of the second-largest swamp in France, called &quot;la Brière&quot;. Given its location, Saint-Nazaire has a long tradition of fishing and shipbuilding. The Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique, one of the largest shipyards in the world, constructed notable ocean liners such as , , and the cruise ship , the largest passenger ship in the world until 2022.

Saint-Nazaire was a small village until the Industrial Revolution but became a large town in the second half of the 19th century, thanks to the construction of railways and the growth of the seaport. Saint-Nazaire progressively replaced upstream Nantes as the main haven on the Loire estuary.

As a major submarine base for the Kriegsmarine, Saint-Nazaire was subject to a successful British raid in 1942 and was heavily bombed by the Allies until 1945. Being one of the Atlantic pockets, Saint-Nazaire was one of the last territories in Europe to be liberated from German occupation, on 11 May 1945. The town was one of the most damaged in France during World War II.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Archaeologists believe that Saint-Nazaire is built upon the remnants of Corbilo, an Armorican Gaulish city populated by the Namnetes tribe, which (according to the Greek navigator Pytheas) was the second-largest Gaulish city, after Massilia (now Marseille). Archeology suggests that the area has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic period, as evidenced by the presence of monuments like the tumulus of Dissignac, the dolmen located in the centre of the present-day city, and ancient bronzes found in the vicinity.

According to the 15th-century chronicler Alain Bouchart, Brutus of Troy, the mythical ancestor of the Bretons, travelled to Saint-Nazaire to set foot upon the new homeland of his people. Historical accounts note that at the end of the Roman Empire, some Britons colonized the Loire estuary and later the peninsula containing Guérande. The farthest extent of the Breton language in the Loire region is Donges, to the east of Saint-Nazaire.

===Middle Ages===
According to the late-6th-century writer Gregory of Tours, the Roman Church sheltered the remains of the martyr Nazarius in a local basilica. According to legend, the Breton chief Waroch II sent an emissary to seize these relics. The plot was foiled when the emissary fractured his skull upon the lintel of the church door. Waroch, interpreting this as a miracle, was deterred and the village thenceforth took the name of Sanctus Nazarius de Sinuario.

After this point, the history of Saint-Nazaire, like much of Europe during the Dark Ages, is not well documented. Battles occurred, such as in 1380 when Jehan d&#x27;Ust defended the city in the name of John V, Duke of Brittany (known in France as Jean IV) against the Castilian fleet during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. After this time, Saint-Nazaire became the seat of a parish extending from Penhoët to Pornichet, part of the Viscountcy of Saint-Nazaire.

Like the whole of Brittany, Saint-Nazaire formed part of the Duchy of Brittany until 1532, when it was annexed by France. In 1756, a fort was built on the order of the governor of Brittany to protect the town, which by then had 600 inhabitants. Until the French Revolution, Saint-Nazaire belonged to the province of Brittany.

===19th century industrialisation===
At the beginning of the 19th century, the port consisted only of one simple harbour. As the town was so far inland, its main economy was not based on commercial fishing but on its strategic location as the lowest possible navigation point for large ships and on supplying pilots for navigation further up the Loire. In 1800, the parish of Saint-Nazaire had 3,216 inhabitants.

The modern Saint-Nazaire was created by the administration of Napoleon III. The population of 3,216 in 1800 shows its battered history, with a mainly local (Brière), of Lower Brittany (of Morbihan in the Finistère-south), and minor representation from most other areas of France. From this point forward the population of Saint-Nazaire experienced exponential growth, which was reflected in its nickname of &quot;Little Breton California&quot;, or &quot;Liverpool of the West&quot;.

In 1802, a road was built to develop the port, which extended by 1835 to a breakwater with a navigational lighthouse at its end. The development included new basins for ships to unload to barges that carried goods further up the river. This development moved the town into the area of the city which is now called the district of &quot;Little Morocco&quot;. This development made the town the base for the passenger steamships of the Nantes–Saint-Nazaire line, as well as making the town the alternative port for ships which could not access Nantes.

In 1856, the first wet dock was dug in &quot;Halluard City&quot;, making it possible for ships to moor and turn. This led to the construction of the town&#x27;s first railway connection. In 1857, the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans (railroad company of Orléans) connected Saint-Nazaire to Nantes. In 1862, the first transatlantic telegraph lines were installed from France to South America, coming ashore at Saint-Nazaire. 1862 also saw the construction of major shipbuilding facilities, including those of Chantier Scott, which launched the first French metal-hulled ships. In 1868, Saint-Nazaire became a sub-prefecture of the town of Savenay. A second dock basin was created at Penhoët in 1881, to allow the handling of larger ships, but a lock gate built to access it cut the town in two, thus creating Old Saint-Nazaire and an artificial island called &quot;Little Morocco&quot;.

In early 1870, Nantes-born Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau joined the bar in Saint-Nazaire. In September he became, in spite of his youth, secretary to the municipal commission temporarily appointed to carry on the town&#x27;s business. He organized the National Defense at Saint-Nazaire, and marched out with his contingent, though they saw no active service due to lack of ammunition (their private store having been commandeered by the state). In 1873, he moved to the bar of Rennes, following the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871.

On 30 March 1894, a strike occurred at the forging mills of Trignac in opposition to a reduction of the work force. What had seemed a small dispute escalated after a shooting in Fourmies, resulting in the town getting its national nickname of &quot;Red City&quot;. Socialists flocked to the town in defense of the striking workers, joining in the declaration of the &quot;Fusillade de Fourmies&quot;.

In 1900, the commune of Pornichet was created by separating from the larger commune of Saint-Nazaire.

===World War I===
During World War I, the city became an important debarkment port of Allied troops, particularly in the latter stages for the United States Army. When they entered the war in 1917, they developed the town and port infrastructure, by adding additional drinking water storage ponds for the town&#x27;s water treatment plants, and a refrigeration terminal to the docks for shipment and storage of meat and dairy products to supply their troops.

However, the presence of legal brothels (&quot;Maisons Tolérée&quot;) resulted in a diplomatic incident. As a result of strict reformist public health concerns at home, the American Expeditionary Force placed the &quot;Maisons Tolérée&quot; off limits, resulting in a dispute between the town&#x27;s brothel owners backed by the mayor, versus the US Army forces. With the dispute escalating, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau sent a memo to General John Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick, who on giving it to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker promptly responded: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, Raymond, don&#x27;t show this to the president or he&#x27;ll stop the war.&quot; Only after the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, when the United States Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, did venereal disease rates among United States Army troops rise quickly.

===Inter-war period===
The post-war period brought about a period of economic depression for the shipbuilders, who consequently diversified into building seaplanes from 1922. In 1926 the district of Paimbœuf was merged with the district of Saint-Nazaire, thus reinforcing the influence of the city on the south bank of the Loire River.

Although having built , between 1913 and 1921, and between 1925 and 1926, as a result of the 1930s Great Depression the French government commissioned a series of state programs to aid national economic activity. The state-owned shipping company Compagnie Générale Transatlantique commissioned the ship builders of Saint-Nazaire to construct a new large passenger ship, which as a result between 1928 and 1934 created the Albert Caquot–engineered the Louis Joubert dry dock – at , the largest of its kind in the world at the time – necessary to be able to accommodate the construction of . In 1932, the Saint-Nazaire casino went bankrupt and was resold to the town of Nantes: the site was redeveloped in 1935 as the first home of the current Saint-Louis school.

As a result of the national general strike of June 1936, to ensure completion of the nationally prestigious project SS &quot;Normandie&quot;, the government nationalised the various private shipyards into one state-owned entity, the 1861-founded Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique.

===World War II===
After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany&#x27;s Wehrmacht army at the start of World War II, the combined forces of the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force failed to hold the oncoming onslaught. As part of Operation Aerial, Saint-Nazaire, like Dunkirk, became an evacuation point to England for the British, with those embarking including the writer John Renshaw Starr.

====Sinking of the &quot;Lancastria&quot;====
On 17 June 1940 an estimated 9,000 British Army soldiers were embarked aboard the Clyde-built cruise liner, later converted to troopship, , which was attacked and sunk by German Junkers Ju 88 bombers, mainly from Kampfgeschwader 30, taking with her around 4,000 victims. This is the worst disaster in British maritime history and the worst loss of life for British forces in the whole of World War II. Winston Churchill banned all news coverage of the disaster on learning of it and it remains largely forgotten by history. A &quot;Lancastria&quot; memorial is located near the U-boat pens in Saint-Nazaire.

====Miracle of Saint-Nazaire====
The ball turret gunner of an American B-17F bomber fell onto the glass roof of the train station, even though his parachute had been destroyed by German flak while still in his plane. The US airman, Alan Magee, survived the fall. A German military surgeon was able to save his nearly severed arm. The airman credited his survival to a prayer to God as he recovered consciousness during his fall.

====U-boat pens====

Following the surrender of France to German forces later in June 1940, the port immediately became a base of operations for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and was as such the target of Allied operations. A heavily fortified U-boat Saint-Nazaire submarine base was built by Organisation Todt shortly after occupation, with a concrete ceiling capable of withstanding almost any bomb in use at the time.

The base provided a home during the war to many of the best-known U-boat staff, including:
*Commander Georg-Wilhelm Schulz – transferred the 6th U-boat Flotilla from Danzig to the port in February 1942, where it became a combat flotilla.
* Carl Emmermann – took command of 6th U-boat Flotilla over from Schulz in November 1942, until it left Saint-Nazaire for Norway in August 1944.
*Lieutenant Commander Herbert Schultze – second in command of 7th U-boat Flotilla from September 1940.

The base stands today as its extremely sturdy construction makes demolition uneconomical. The base is now used by cafes, a bar and on the roof is an exhibition about Saint-Nazaire.

====St Nazaire Raid====
The huge Joubert drydock built for SS &quot;Normandie&quot; was the only port on the Atlantic capable of servicing the German battleships and . This made the port strategically important to both the Axis Powers and the Allies during World War II. After Operation Rheinübung on 18–27 May 1941, which resulted in the sinking of and the sinking of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the need for the Allies to take the Joubert dry dock out of operation was increased. On 28 March 1942, a force of 611 British Commandos and the Royal Navy launched the St Nazaire Raid against the shipyards of Saint-Nazaire, codenamed Operation Chariot. An obsolete American-built destroyer was used as a ram-ship loaded with explosives. It and the Commandos succeeded in destroying the gates and machinery of the Joubert drydock, preventing its further use by the Germans during the war. Of the 600+ navy and commando personnel, 220 returned, half were wounded. Five Victoria Crosses and 69 other decorations were awarded. The Joubert dry dock was not brought back into operation until 1948.

====After Operation Chariot====
The U-boat threat to supply convoys across the Atlantic made Saint-Nazaire a constant target of Allied air forces, in the face of determined Luftwaffe fighter opposition to raids by United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force bombers. On 3 January 1943 Colonel Curtis LeMay led 85 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 1st Bombardment Wing against the U-boat pens at Saint-Nazaire, on the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s sixth raid against the facility. LeMay also introduced the combat box defensive formation, echeloning three-plane elements within a squadron, and squadrons within a group, to concentrate defensive firepower against fighter opposition. Only 76 aircraft found and hit the target, and during the mission seven bombers were shot down and 47 damaged.

As a result of the raid, on 14 January 1943 under directive (S.46239/?? A.C.A.S. Ops), the Allies implemented incendiary bomb tactics against U-boat pens, under the Area bombing directive. To minimize civilian casualties during air attacks, the Allies devised a plan to force an evacuation of the town. For three days in 1943, British Royal Air Force and American aircraft dropped scores of leaflets warning the population of a planned fire-bombing raid. At the end of the third day, the raid came and burned the entire city to the ground. Casualties were light as most of the civilians had heeded the warning and fled to the safety of the countryside but after that point, except for the self-contained U-boat base, Saint-Nazaire remained abandoned until the end of the war.

After D-day and the liberation of most of France in 1944, German troops in Saint-Nazaire&#x27;s submarine base refused to surrender, and they holed up (as did their counterparts in the La Rochelle and Lorient bases). Since the Germans could no longer conduct major submarine operations from the bases without a supply line, the SHAEF commander, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to simply bypass these ports, and the Allied armies focused their resources on the invasion of Germany. Saint-Nazaire and the other two German &quot;pockets&quot; remained under German control until after the last day of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945.

===After World War II===

The town of St. Nazaire was rebuilt in the late 1940s and 1950s in a minimalist functional style. One of the last of these buildings to be completed was the Hôtel de Ville which was completed in February 1960.

The submarine base was used by the French Navy from 1945 to 1948. It then came under the control of various chemical companies and shipbuilders. , the French diesel submarine &quot;Espadon&quot; is moored within the U-boat pens. Tours of the submarine are available to the public.

After the construction of in 1961, the last Compagnie Générale Transatlantique liner and the subsequent closure of the Suez Canal, Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique began building large oil tankers, including , , and . A new dry dock (Basin C) was planned for the construction of tankers over 1,000,000 tonnes but this fell through with the reopening of the Suez Canal. was constructed at Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique in 2003.

==Geography==

The town of Saint-Nazaire is located on the north bank of the Loire estuary (its territory includes the tip of Chémoulin which marks the end of the estuary), 50 km west of Nantes. It is near the marshes of Brière, an important regional natural park with many animal and plant species, the second largest wetland in France after the Camargue.

According to INSEE, Saint-Nazaire is the commune-center of an urban unit (commonly: agglomeration) which counted 186,760 inhabitants in 2018, gathering 17 communes of the Loire estuary. This unit is the urban center of the urban area of Saint-Nazaire (24 communes), which had 213,675 inhabitants in 2018 and extending over Brière and almost all of the Guérande peninsula. The eastern part of the town is on the alluvial terrain between the Brière and the Loire estuary. The western part, more extensive, corresponds to the extension of the hillside of Guérande: the relief is hilly and of higher altitude, where one finds a granite and metamorphic base. Geologically, Saint-Nazaire is located in the Armorican massif.

==Climate==

In close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the climate of Saint-Nazaire is, as with the rest of the Loire-Atlantique, of temperate oceanic type, with &quot;Cfb&quot; designation in Köppen climate classification. This climate is very much influenced by the Loire estuary. The winters are mild, and summer is warm. Snowfall is rare, but rain is frequent (116 days a year with precipitation) but not very intense, the annual rainfall being 789 mm. Precipitation is however relatively variable from one year to the next. The sunshine is 1,892 hours a year.

Saint-Nazaire receives mainly southwestern sector winds related to the Atlantic depressions and northeastern sector winds when the weather is more stable. The annual average wind of 4.5 m / s and there are 60 days per year of strong wind.

==Education==

===Schools===
The primary schools of Saint-Nazaire (Carnot, Jean-Jaurès, Lamartine, Jules Ferry, Ferdinand Bush, Boncourt, etc.) educate nearly 8,000 pupils in 30 school complexes. The junior schools have nearly 7,000 pupils in 12 colleges: public colleges Albert Vinçon; Pierre Norange; Manon Roland; Jean de Neyman; Jean Moulin, accommodate around 1,350 pupils each. Private colleges include: Saint-Louis (1,000 pupils, boarding school; historically a college for boys), Sainte-Therese (historically a college for girls).

The high schools educate 6,000 pupils into 11 lycées, with the mainstream education and technical school Aristide Briand having some 2,500 pupils, one of the largest lycée of France; an experimental lycée, public lycée managed jointly by the teachers and the pupils; the private lycée of Saint-Louis mainstream education; the hotel private lycée Sainte-Anne; the private of mainstream education and technological college Our-Lady-in Espérance. The Cité Scolaire of Saint-Nazaire is one of largest of France, with nearly 4,000 high-school pupils.

===University===
The University of Saint-Nazaire is a college of the University of Nantes, the second largest university in France with approximately 35,000 students, including nearly 5,000 on the university campus of Saint-Nazaire.

==Transport==

The Route nationale N165/N161 (E60 route) connects Saint-Nazaire to Nantes and Rennes via the Pont de Saint-Nazaire, which crosses the Loire. Paris is then accessed via the A10/A11 in Nantes. Valves, Lorient, Quimper and Brest are accessed via the N165.

A project to review a second crossing of the Loire between Nantes and Saint Nazaire is being considered, planned to be constructed and operational by 2025.

===Railway===
Saint-Nazaire railway station is served by both the TGV and regional trains and buses of the TER Pays de la Loire. TGV (high speed train) connection to Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille, and Strasbourg, with trains to Paris via the LGV Atlantique taking just over 2 hours. TER Pays de la Loire provides links to Nantes, Angers, Le Mans, La Roche sur Yon, and other regional cities and towns.

===Air travel===
Saint-Nazaire airport is located south-east of Saint-Nazaire, in the &quot;commune&quot; of Montoir-de-Bretagne. It has an annual capacity of approximately 150,000 passengers, and is the operational and maintenance base for Eagle Aviation France.

International travel is via Nantes Atlantique Airport, the biggest airport in western France, linking with several French and European cities as well as Montreal in Canada (seasonally) and some cities in North Africa. A new airport was planned that was to be situated to the north-west of Nantes in the &quot;commune&quot; of Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Called Aéroport du Grand Ouest, it was officially cancelled in 2018.

==Economy==

The economy of the city is founded on the activity of the port, including export of manufactured goods but also on the services, being given sizeable size of the city. Commercial fishing has almost completely disappeared in spite of the existence of a small fleet of fisheries and fishing vessels.

Saint-Nazaire suffered heavily from the downsizing of shipbuilding activity in western Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, after the completion of the national passenger liner, SS &quot;France&quot;. For a long time in the 1980s, Saint-Nazaire remained an economically depressed area with unemployment rates above 20%. Today, the local economy is more diversified and its situation is more in line with that of France as a whole. The major industries are:

*Shipyard – having previously concentrated on both naval and cargo ship construction, Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique has completed a successful reconversion to cruise ship building and is now one of the world leaders in this sector. Purchased by Aker Yards, the Cunard Line&#x27;s new flagship, RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, was built in Saint-Nazaire.
*Airbus – Saint-Nazaire is one of the European centers of Airbus, responsible for the fitting out of aircraft fuselage sections. Originally a factory built for SNCASO, it is located at Penhoët, immediate north of the sites of Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique. An additional facility was built in Gron in 1980. For the Airbus A380, the Airbus Roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ship brings fuselage sections from Hamburg, (Germany) for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. The ship then unloads these sections plus wings from Filton, Bristol and Broughton in North Wales at Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, Gironde, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse. New wider roads, canal systems and barges were developed to deliver the A380 parts. After assembly, the aircraft are flown to Hamburg, XFW to be furnished and painted.
*Aeronautical engineering – Famat, a joint-venture company between Snecma and General Electric, has a factory in Saint-Nazaire. Employing approximately 450 people, Famat specializes in the manufacture of structural elements for turbojets.
*Mechanical engineering – SEMT Pielstick, a manufacturer of diesel engines intended for naval and railway applications and for electrical production. Now part of MAN B&amp;W Diesel, the SEMT Pielstick factory employed in 2006 670 people in Saint-Nazaire.

*Port – the primary French port on the Atlantic coast. Now busier than its rival Nantes, it is managed by the Port Authority of Nantes-Saint-Nazaire. The port terminal handles high volumes of food products, and methane, and oil company Elf de Donges and many other industries.

Saint Nazaire hosts the first French offshore wind farm with 80 wind turbines that 
will produce enough power to cover consumptions of around 700,000 people.

<text>The Piece Hall is a Grade I listed building in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. It was built as a cloth hall for handloom weavers to sell the woollen cloth &quot;pieces&quot; they had produced.

== History ==
The earliest known reference to the new Piece Hall was a handbill dated 19 March 1774, although this no longer survives. The hall was built for &quot;the purpose of depositing and exposing to sale the worsted and woollen goods manufactured in this town and neighbourhood&quot;. It was seen that bringing merchants and buyers together in one place would create a more competitive and efficient market and discourage fraudsters. Initially, two sites were proposed, one at Talbot Croft and the other at Cross Field (which was used in 1948 for the construction of the new bus station). After consideration, Talbot Croft was chosen and was purchased in September 1774.

It opened on 1 January 1779, with 315 separate rooms arranged around a central open courtyard.

The architect of Piece Hall has never been identified, and there is a lack of documentary evidence surrounding its design and construction; F. A. Leyland cited Thomas Bradley as the most likely architect in 1887, although others have suggested Samuel and John Hope and John Carr.

An 1831 description of Piece Hall says:
The Industrial Revolution saw a shift away from small producers and traders, with new larger mills in the Halifax area trading directly with merchants and exporters. After years of decline, the Piece Hall was acquired from the trustees in 1868 by Halifax Corporation. They converted it into a wholesale market hall and some of the small rooms were combined to make larger shop units; cellars were created and the south pedestrian gate was enlarged to allow vehicles to enter the courtyard with Iron Gates installed over the entrance (supplied by George Smith of the Sun Foundry, Glasgow for £120). Sheds and latrines were constructed in the courtyard.

In 1971, after the Piece Hall had become seen as unsuitable for a wholesale market, the businesses were dispersed elsewhere throughout the town and demolition of the then two-century-old building was considered. Government grants were made available and the Halifax Corporation received funding to make the building a tourist attraction. The sheds that had been built in the 19th century were demolished and the courtyard landscaped; further, walls were removed from the original rooms to create shops, and a new museum–art gallery was opened on the east side. The new Piece Hall opened on 3 July 1976. The museum–art gallery closed in 1998.

In 2010, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded Calderdale Council first round funding to restore and redevelop the Piece Hall.

The Piece Hall reopened on 1 August 2017, after a £19 million restoration project started in 2014.

The Piece Hall hosted its first major music event with Father John Misty headlining.

Piece Hall Trust has been set up as a charity responsible for managing the Piece Hall.

== Listing ==

The Piece Hall was listed on 3 November 1954 and has Grade I listed protection. Reasons for the listing were given as:
* Historic interest: citing the scale and architectural grandeur and its illustration of the wealth of Halifax at the time of its construction.
* Rarity: citing the rarity of surviving purpose built cloth halls.
* Architectural interest: citing its dramatic design, its detailed galleries and courtyard as well as a high degree of craftsmanship and the high quality of materials used
* Architectural layout: citing the courtyard plan but the provision of individual rooms to enable confidentiality in transactions. Despite the combination of some rooms internally the building remains externally unchanged and &quot;visually readable&quot;.

<doc id="427425" wikidata="Q379627" url="?curid=427425" title="Noe Zhordania">
<text>Noe Zhordania ( ; ; born – January 11, 1953) was a Georgian journalist and Menshevik politician. He played an eminent role in the socialist revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire, and later chaired the government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia from July 24, 1918, until March 18, 1921, when the Bolshevik Russian Red Army invasion of Georgia forced him into exile to France. There Zhordania led the government-in-exile until his death in 1953.

== Biography ==
===Early life and background===
Zhordania was born on , to a petty landowner family living in the village of Lanchkhuti in Guria, western Georgia, then part of the Kutais Governorate of Imperial Russia.

According to Redjeb Jordania (born in 1921), son of Noe Jordania (Zhordania), his lineage traces back to three Italian brothers who emigrated from Genoa to Georgia. One of them was a gardener and the others were merchants. One moved to Samegrelo and became the ancestor of the Zhordanias from the (). Another moved to Arkhava () and his descendants are the Zhordanias from Arkhava. The third was granted serfs and estates from the House of Gurieli in Lanchkhuti, and so remained in Guria. He was the ancestor of the Zhordanias from Lanchkhuti, including Radjeb (Redjeb) Zhordania, grandfather of Noe Zhordania.

In his early years Radjab became an orphan and he was taken in Samegrelo by his uncles. Later he returned in his hometown Lanchkhuti, but he was not welcomed by the relatives. Thus, after moving to Shukhuti he demanded his share of the property from the relatives. He was given the land, where he built the Oda () (typical house in the region of Guria), married the daughter of Apakidze and remained there during the period 1825 to 1830. Later he participated in the Crimean War, where he received the rank of captain and where he was later killed. He had four sons: Butchu, Potine, Niko and Iosef. Niko, father of Noe and Gulchino Zhordania, was the village scriber, and lawyer and mediator in court. Kristine Chikovani, mother of Noe, was from Samegrelo.

=== Education ===
He had his primary education in a Lanchkhuti public school. Afterwards, he graduated from the Ozurgeti Orthodox Theological Academy. He then moved to Tbilisi where he graduated from the Georgian Orthodox Theological Seminary, a prestigious academic institution at the time (just a few years later Josef Stalin would enter that same academy). However, while Noe&#x27;s parents hoped that their child would become a priest, from an early age he started to disbelieve in God. He wrote: 

&#x27;God is Nature herself; as for a white-bearded deity, seated upon a throne, such a personage simply does not exist&#x27;. &#x27;I thought to myself: If Nature&#x27;s lord and master is Nature itself, then who is the rightful lord and master of mankind? The general opinion was that the Tsar (King) was the lord over the people, and that the Tsar(King) was himself appointed by God. But if God did not exist any more, the Tsar(King) could not be his representative. I was therefore at a loss to understand by whose command and authority he sat upon his throne.&#x27;

In the academy he was the head of an illegal student association that was opposing the drawbacks of the present situation in Academy. At the same time he was reading forbidden books, such as the Russian revolutionary-democratic literature of (Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Alexander Herzen), and familiarized himself with the content of populist literature, magazines and newspapers provided by Zakaria Chichinadze. In 1891 he moved to Warsaw, Poland, and attended the Warsaw Veterinarian Institute. During this period young Zhordania understood the basics of Marxism. In his memories Zhordania described his political evolution in 1892 as a reflection of Russia&#x27;s transition from socialism to Marxism. Specifically he meant the period after 1891, when he left his homeland to continue his studies abroad. With Filipp Makharadze, Noe Zhordania started a close correspondence with other Georgian intellectuals, namely Silvester Dzhibladze and Egnate Ninoshvili, by sending them illegal Marxist literature. He was impressed by &quot;Mr. L. Tikhomirov&#x27;s Grief&quot;, a booklet written by Georgi Plekhanov. In Warsaw, apart from Marxism, Zhordania also became acquainted with the Polish national movement, which fought for the autonomy of Poland. In 1892, he was forced to leave for Georgia due to Pneumonia.

=== Early career ===
When he came back to Georgia, he propagated the Marxist ideas among the workers of Tbilisi, and in the 1890s he became a leader of the first legal Marxist organization in Georgia, called the Mesame Dasi (the Third Group). In late December 1892, Noe Zhordania emerged on the political scene. He attended the Marxian meetings at the Aleksandre Pushkin House in Kvirila, and eventually became a member of the first Marxist group. Other famous members were: Nikolay Chkheidze, Eugene Vatsadze, Mikha Tskhakaia, Joseph Kakabadze, Razhden Kaladze, Dmitry Kalandarishvili, Isidore Ramishvili, Arsen Tsitlidze, Isidore Kvitsaridze and Silibistro Jibladze. The group ultimately failed to reach an agreement on certain issues and thus, Noe Zhordania, with Kibladze and Egnate Ninoshvili, were left in charge of creating action program for the group. They outlined importance of the working class in overthrowing the old society, and added the national question in their programme. The programme was adopted and then, in 1894, published in the journal &quot;Moambe&quot;. It was based on the following provisions: 1.The person&#x27;s physical well-being 2. Freedom of the individual and state 3. National identity of the people, based on social label. Later on, the group got the name Mesame Dasi. In May 1893, fearing of possible arrest, Zhordania traveled to Europe from Batumi. When the order of his arrest was released in Lanchkhuti, he was already in Geneva. There he met other Marxist group members: Georgi Plekhanov, Lev Deichi, and Vera Zasulichi. There he read Marxist literature and explored the Swiss workers and peasants&#x27; life, writing down and then sending his notes to the journal Kvali (). In 1894, he was tried by the Russian authorities for his participation in the &quot;League of Freedom of Georgia&quot;. In 1895, he went to Paris and studied at the for 3 months, became acquainted with Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue and other French socialists in the meantime. He remained in Paris for four months before going back to Geneva and, from there he headed to Germany, the birthplace of Marxist ideologies. He settled in Stuttgart for two reasons: first, there he met Karl Kautsky, and second, there was not a single Georgian or Russian in Stuttgart who could prevent Zhordania from learning the German language. In order to familiarize himself with the political economy of the bourgeoisie, Zhordania moved to Munich. There he enrolled at the university and followed the course of Professor Franz Brentano. At the beginning of 1896 Zhordania left Munich and traveled to Berlin, where he attended the lectures of Richard Wagner. While living in Germany Zhordania wrote the following articles for &quot;Kvali&quot;: &quot;Friedrich Engels&quot; (1895) (), &quot;the village and agricultural growing in Germany&quot; (1985) (), &quot;Political parties in Germany&quot; (1897) (), &quot;Bismarck&quot; (1898) ().

In March 1897, Zhordania moved to London, England with Varlam Cherkezishvili, a known photographer, who back then lived with the Wilson family. At the British Museum he studied literature from all around the world, including from Georgia. In 1897 Zordania returned to Georgia. Upon his arrival the country was split into two camps: on one hand, the right-wing ideology headed by Ilia Chavchavadze called &quot;Iberian&#x27;s camp&quot;, and the other left-wing ideology called &quot;Kvali camp&quot;. In November 1897, Zhordania organized two consortium, one in Tbilisi and the other in Lanchkhuti. Aiming to buy the journal &quot;Kvali&quot;, he would later initiate a dialogue with Anastasya Tumanishvili and Giorgi Tsereteli, the directors of the famous magazine. In January 1898, &quot;Kvali&quot; became one of the first Marxists legal body. It was also the first example in the Russian Empire of the Socialists having a legal organ. The Social Democrats, meanwhile were also illegally stamping brochures, leaflets, and newspapers. In 1899 they released the first printed leaflets called &quot;proclamation&quot;, which advised Georgian workers to join the European workers for the first of May. The proclamation was written by Zhordania, and printed by Vlasa Mgeladze. This increased the tensions between the two camps, and in 1900 the magazines of the two parties started to print a heated debate between the each other.

Clashes between the workers and the army took place on 1 May 1901. Many activists became targets of the police and Noe Zhordania being one of them. Trying to save himself, he decided to flee to Europe on the grounds of health problems and borrowed 300 rubles from David Sarajishvili. Shortly afterwards he was arrested in Kutaisi, where he was given charges after eight months in prison and then transferred first to Tbilisi, and later to Metekhi. He was charged with the crime of being involved with the illegal activities of the social-democratic party, even though Kvali was considered to be a legal newspaper. During his imprisonment Zhordania started to read other literature, like Shakespeare and Hugo. In 1902, Zhordania strongly condemned the merge between the Georgian Social-Democratic organization and the Russian Social-Democratic Party.

In June 1902 Zhordania was released from prison and moved to Lanchkhuti before the final verdict from the St. Peterburg police. At this time in the region there was an active Guria peasant movement, led by the Social Democrats. During the mass arrests Zhordania was taken and put in prison, where he met other 200 Gurians and Noe Khomeriki. Later he was transferred from Kutaisi to Poti, and forced in exile in Ganja, where he lived under police custody. However, he was still illegally involved in the party conferences. He wrote a draft of the party program during a conference held in Tbilisi in 1902. Meanwhile, the St. Petersburg police informed Zhordania that his final verdict was to be exiled in the Vitki Province for 3 years. Zhordania escaped in Batumi, where he hid for 10 days in a secret flat, before fleeing to England with a ferry. The ferry captain did not assist political refugees, so he was told that Zhordania was a military deserter.

After three weeks of travelling Zhordania first arrived in London, then went to Paris, and finally to Geneva to meet Plekhanov. There he was informed about the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party consortium in Brussels and he was invited with an advisory vote. In Brussels, Zhordania met three delegates from the South Caucasus: Topuridze, Knuniantsi and Zurabovi. Zhordania&#x27;s program was not selected by the Caucasian Committee: the one that was chosen differed only in national and agrarian issues. Brussels local police banned the congress and the delegates moved to London.

Having been elected as a delegate to the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1903, he sided with the Menshevik faction and gained significant influence. In 1905, he edited a Tbilisi-based Georgian Menshevik newspaper, the &quot;Sotsial-Demokratia&quot; known for its fierce attacks on the Bolsheviks. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he went against the armed uprising and advocated the creation of a legal workers’ party. On the 4th Congress of the RSDLP in 1906, he supported the idea of land municipalization. The same year, he was elected to the First State Duma from the Tiflis Governorate and became a spokesman for the Social-Democratic faction. The 5th Congress of the RSDLP transferred him into the Central Committee where he maintained his post until 1912. Having signed the &quot;Viborg declaration,&quot; a protest against the dissolution of the First Duma, in December 1907, he was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. In mid-1912, he edited a Baku-based legal Menshevik newspaper &quot;Nashe Slovo&quot;. In 1914, he collaborated with Leon Trotsky in the magazine &quot;Borba&quot; where he published a series of articles on the question of nationality.

=== Social Democrat leader ===

In 1905, during the revolution, with a false passport and the fake name of &quot;Ignatov&quot;, Zhordania arrived in St. Petersburg, where his wife and party comrade Ina Koreneva was waiting for him. From there Zhordania went to Baku, left Ina there and then headed to Tbilisi. In Tbilisi he saw a different political situation from what he had left: the camp of Ilia Chavchavadze was disbanded, the newspaper &quot;Iveria&quot; was managed by Philipe Gogichaishvili (); the Social Democratic party had another newspaper, the &quot;Tsnobis Purtseli&quot;, and in place of &quot;Kvali&quot; there was a new magazine, the &quot;Traveler&quot;, which was Bolshevik oriented. During that time Ina, Zhordania&#x27;s pregnant wife, was arrested. Thus, Zhordania had to go back to Baku and start negotiation with a famous public figure, Ivane Eliashvili. Eliashvili helped in releasing Ina Koreneva. In April 1905 Ina went to Lanchkhuti, where she gave birth to their first daughter Asmat.

During that time Zhordania unleashed the Georgian Bolsheviks both in Tbilisi and in provinces. The social democratic direction evolved in a way that differed from both from the Russian Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. They had a clandestine newspaper called &quot;Social Democrat&quot;, and a legal one called &quot;Skhivi&quot;, both edited by Zhordania, alongside other newspapers: &quot;Lightning&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot;.
Meanwhile, Nicholas II of Russia issued an order of activating the State Duma. The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party protested against it. Yet, Zordania tried not let go the opportunity. He participated in the IV unifying congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in Stockholm in 1906. The congress discussed how to boycott the elections and land issues. The Menshevik party gained favor: Zhordania, however, was elected as a member of congress. He soon discovered that he had also been elected as a member of the State Duma of the Russian Empire. Meanwhile, the Social Democrats won the elections in Georgia. They created the Social Democratic faction in the Duma led by Noe: however, after about a month the State Duma was discharged.

After the Duma was dissolved he remained in St. Petersburg, working illegally. In order to create a second State Duma, parties were invited to the conference in Tamerpos. Apart from Lenin, everybody supported the election. With Zhordania&#x27;s advice, Irakli Tsereteli decided to participate, and he later became the Social Democratic faction leader in the Duma. In 1907, after the murder of Ilia Chavchavadze, Zhordania published article in which he wrote that Marxists nihilists do not look to the past, but, in every historical era they see progress. He compared Ilia to the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, in that &quot;revolution lead him to death, but no one condemned the revolution&quot;.
During the V congress of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in London in 1907, 29 Georgian delegates were present. At the congress, Lenin asked Zhordania not to interfere in the Russian Bolshevik&#x27;s activities: in return, he offered them autonomy in domestic matters. Zhordania rejected the proposal. He was elected as a member of the Party Central Committee at the congress. The committee office was located in Finland, so he remained there and went to St. Petersburg only occasionally. When the second State Duma was dismissed, the Social Democrat Leaders, including Irakli Tsereteli, were apprehended and deported to Siberia.
In occasion of the elections of the State Duma in December 1907, Zhordania illegally returned to Georgia. He helped Nikolay Chkheidze in defeating another candidate, Luarsab Andronikashvil, in elections. Evgeni Gegechkori became the deputy in Kutaisi. In August 1908, Zhordania was arrested again and sent to St. Petersburg. Accused of using a fake passport, he was sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment. After eight months in jail, he was suddenly released and went to Baku, where his wife and children awaited for him. In Baku, Zhordania became head editor of the Menshevik newspaper &quot;Our Words&quot;. At this time David Sarajishvili had entrusted him to draw up his own library catalog, and gave him a cash prize, before sending him and his family to Italy for a cooperative investigation. In 1909, during his stay in Italy, Zhordania attended the Paris meeting of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The session aimed to the expropriate Bolsheviks and divestiture ban, which was, accepted. In Vienna, in the newspaper of Leon Trotsky, &quot;Battle&quot;, had published letters about the party unification.

After returning from Italy, Zhordania worked in Tbilisi, Baku and Lanchkhuti, cooperating with the party press. In Lanchkhuti he was caught and charged with a call to political and social disorder. He was sentenced to three years in prison in Kutaisi, but he was able to pay his bail, that was only three thousand rubles. The tsar announced an amnesty in 1913 to mark the three hundred-year rule of the Romanov dynasty: it focused on press crimes and gave Zhordania his freedom. Meanwhile, Ina Koreneva, who led the Social Democrats in the election campaign in Baku, was banned from living in the Caucasus and moved in Moscow with her children.

=== World War I ===
The RSDLP did not work properly in different countries in 1914. The only exception of this rule was in Georgia, where they were relatively more effective. In Baku they were not working as well, while in Kiev the RSDLP did not exist at all. Zhordania went to Europe with the aim of finding an agreement with the members of RSDLP&#x27;s central committee. The party had already split into two factions, and none of them had any hope of the revolution that was due to come in Russia. Zhordania met Leon Trotsky in Vienna, in June, and published his letters regarding Bolshevik-Menshevik relations and national issues. Following his doctor&#x27;s advice, he later decided to spend the summer in Montreux, Switzerland, where he staid three weeks. During the second half of July he went to Beatenberg, where he intended to stay until the end of August, and then to visit Zürich, where the Bolsheviks gathered, and Geneva, where the Mensheviks had gathered. In Geneva, he intended to meet Mgeladze Vlasi and the other Social Democrat immigrants.

The First World War started on August 2, changing his plans. Zhordania immediately decided to return to his homeland: the only way was through Istanbul, by the sea. Benito Mussolini, at the time the editor of the Italian Social Democratic Party newspaper &quot;Avanti&quot;, helped him to buy the tickets from Venice to Istanbul. Zhordania arrived in Odessa, where he reunited with his wife and children. Zhordania, in the end, did not contribute to this dispute: he settled in Lanchkhuti and began writing letters to be published in various newspapers. He published a letter from &quot;War and Peace&quot;, where he stressed his anti-Germanic position.

At the same time, Zhordania secretly met Mikheil Tsereteli, an old acquaintance, who had translated Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot; in English and brought it to his editorial office. Tsereteli worked with a German oriented committee, which aimed to liberate Georgia with the help of Germany and the Ottoman Empire. Zhordania supported the idea of independence, but had different views on tactics: he was waiting for the right moment, and did not support the protests against Russia, because he felt that it would lead to repression. They agreed to work on their own, since both ways could produce the same result.

Furthermore, the Social Democratic Party didn&#x27;t reach consensus on the national issue. It was decided to organize a party conference, which was held in Junjuat. The conference agreed on the declaration of independence only if the Russian army would leave Georgian territory.

=== Revolution and independence ===

During World War I, Zhordania maintained a &quot;defensist&quot; position and worked for Georgi Plekhanov&#x27;s Journal &quot;Samozaschita&quot; (1916). After the 1917 February Revolution, he chaired the Tbilisi soviet and on March 6, 1917, he was elected as a commissioner of the executive committee of the Tbilisi Soviet. In August 1917, he was elected to the Central Committee of the RSDLP(u[nited]). On the September 3, 1917, he made a speech calling on the workers not to succumb to Bolshevist sentiments, but rather to fight for the establishment of a parliamentary republic. In October 1917, he joined the Russian Pre-Parliament, but soon became disillusioned with it and returned to Georgia. On November 26, 1917, he obtained a chair of the Presidium of the National Council of Georgia and played a leading role in the consolidation of Menshevik power in Georgia. His wavering position on formal secession from Bolshevist Russia ended in May 1918, when he headed a parliamentary session which declared the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia. On July 24, 1918, he became Head of the Government of Georgia. 

In January 1918, Army units situated on the Caucasian Front lines moved towards Tbilisi. The Georgian National Council, commanding a newly created Georgian regular army (the first Georgian Corps) and National Guard units were able to stop the Russian army. The Russians were forced to forego the occupation of Tbilisi and retreated towards Baku. The Transcaucasian Commissariat did not recognize the conditions of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. In April 1918, the Ottomans occupied the Batumi region, Guria and Samtskhe-Javakheti. On April 9, 1918, Transcaucasian independence was announced: that was one of the requirements of the Ottoman Empire. Zhordania did not support the declaration of independence, as he believed that an independent Caucasus could have easily fallen into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. A South Caucasus delegation left for Batumi to negotiate with their Ottoman colleagues: they met on May 11, 1918. It appeared that all three South Caucasus nations had different foreign policies. 
Georgia favored assistance from Germany, who required Georgia to become independent.
In the morning of May 26, 1918, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic and so-called &quot;Transcaucasian Seim&quot; () were born. At 5:10PM Georgia declared its independence. The Independence Act was formed by lawyer Gvazava and had been previously introduced to Zhordania. In addition to the national provisions, there were also included some social issues, like, for example, the eight-hour working day and rules for land confiscation. Zhordania, however, removed the social provisions and left only the national political ones. He read the redacted Independence Act at the National Council, who unanimously approved it. From 24 July, instead of Noe Ramishvili, Zhordania became the temporary Prime Minister (chairman of the Government).

In 1919, there was a proportional system based on the Constituent Assembly elections. The meeting was opened on March 12. Out of 130 deputies, 109 were Social-Democrat. Zhordania was free from autocratic dictatorial aspirations and considered the advice from other parties. The coat of arms of Georgia was adopted after Zhordania&#x27;s proposal. To avoid clericalism, all religious signs related to St. George were removed. On March 21, 1919, he was elected as a chairman of the Government, who was also one of the two High Representatives of the Republic of Georgia, with chairman of the Constituent Assembly.
Under Noe Zhordania&#x27;s leadership, the new administration established the Tbilisi State Conservatory and the Institute of Caucasian Archaeology and History in 1917. They designated Georgian as the official language of the republic and founded Tbilisi State University, declaring it to be a Georgian language institute of higher education.
During 1919–20, Georgia experienced serious troubles. The Bolsheviks consistently organized fights. Philipe Makharadze escaped from the Metekhi prison, which ceased the rumors that he was assisted by Zhordania himself, as an old friend. The country experienced great economic hardship, lack of food and bread, and hyperinflation. In his memoirs Zhordania noted that because of the hardship it was difficult to convince people to work with the government. 
He opposed Bolshevik and separatist tendencies, and ethnic minorities were granted political and cultural rights. Zhordania tried to achieve international recognition for Georgia. In 1920, Zhordania sent Gregory Uratadze to Russia to begin negotiations regarding the recognition of Georgia as an independent state. The treaty was signed on May 7, 1920. With this agreement, diplomatic relations between Georgia and Russia were established, and Georgia achieved international recognition. A month before signing the contract, the Georgian army repelled the Russian army, which had tried to take Tbilisi from Azerbaijan. Zhordania ordered the guard to spread the rumor that Azerbaijan had been the aggressor, and not Russia. However, when the Soviet government proposed a joint offensive against the Volunteer Army of Anton Denikin, Zhordania remarked &quot; &quot;I prefer the imperialists of the West to the fanatics of the East.&quot;

In December 1920, the League of Nations refused to make Georgia and Armenia members, but, after a month, in January 1921, Georgia had reached international legal recognition. In February, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Democratic Republic. In three years, his government had organized a successful land reform, adopted comprehensive social and political legislation, and cultivated widespread international ties, enabling Georgia to become the only Transcaucasian nation to earn de jure recognition from Soviet Russia and the Western powers. Apart from massive peasant support, his government managed to gain, through combining socialism, democracy, and a moderate form of nationalism, the loyalty of the intellectual élites and nobility, and played a crucial role in transforming Georgia into a modern political nation. However, the invasion of the Soviet armies in February–March 1921 toppled the Georgian government, forcing Zhordania and many of his colleagues to seek refuge in France, where he led the government-in-exile and continued his efforts to earn international recognition of the Soviet occupation of Georgia and foreign support for Georgian independence until his death in Paris in 1953.

In 1923, Noe Zhordania made an appeal to Washington in which he said:

He also said in the appeal that Chekists had killed without trial hundreds of people, including women and children, many of them from the Georgian intellectual class.

===Emigration and death===
In Istanbul, Zhordania met with the French ambassadors and was invited to settle the Georgian government in exile in France. However, in April 1921, Zhordania was not warmly welcomed in France.
He later visited Brussels and London, asking the respective governments for support, but they expressed no interest in the issue.
Zhordania gave up and decided to work with the European countries, and to assist his remaining comrades in Georgia.

Zhordania lived first in Paris, and then in Leuville-sur-Orge, where he helped with the preparation of the Georgian revolt in 1924. Shortly after, his mother, and his daughter Asmat, who had not left Georgia in 1921, were arrested and imprisoned in Batumi. Sergo Kavtaradze, a week later, offered to help them flee the country, but his mother refused the proposal.

Zhordania wrote books in which he criticized the Soviet Union as &quot;the revolution under mask of imperialism&quot;. In addition to his political treatises, when he was still in Paris, in 1930, he published the Georgian epic poem by Shota Rustaveli, &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;.

By 1933 he had published 12 other books, some of which were &quot;Combating Problems&quot; (), &quot;We and They&quot; (), &quot;Soviet System&quot; (), &quot;True and False Communism&quot; (), &quot;Politics&quot; (), &quot;Bolshevism&quot; (), &quot;Our Differences&quot; (), and &quot;Democracy&quot; (). In Paris he founded the Georgian Social-Democratic journal &quot;Battle&quot; () and the newspaper &quot;Battle Cry&quot; (). Until the 1990s the journal he founded, &quot;Our Flag&quot; (), was active, and later edited by his son-in-law, Levan Paghava.

Noe Zhordania died at the age of 85, on January 11, 1953, in Leuville-sur-Orge, where he is buried. In 1968 his memorial, titled &quot;My Past&quot;, was published in English and Russian posthumously. On 10 March 2004, Mikhail Saakashvili offered to move Zhordania&#x27;s remains to Georgia.

The &quot;Noe Zhordania Institute&quot; in Paris studies his heritage and the history of social democracy in Georgia.

== Ideology ==

Zhordania was a Marxist, leaning towards the social-democratic. He focused on the peasantry and dealt with the national issue.
As a child he grew up as an Orthodox Christian. He questioned the existence of God for the first time in school, after reading &quot;The Door to Nature&quot; of Iakob Gogebashvili: because of it, he found out that natural disasters had a scientific explanation. Because of his doubts regarding the existence of God he ended up questioning the legitimacy of the government of the king, since the king&#x27;s legitimacy was commonly perceived being a divine ordination. Even in school he had a strong belief:
During the seminary studies he formed the Group of Narodnik Socialists, that supported the revolution. The Narodniks recognized a revolution that was not Democratic, but Socialist: they demanded the establishment of socialism. They believed that the only choice was between either priesthood or being a Narodnik. 
In Warsaw, Zhordania was introduced to Marxism and its political ideology: that was after 1892, when the revolutionaries in Russia went from seeking socialism to European Marxism.

In his view, Russian socialism was an utopian and reactionary doctrine, which brought people back to barbarism. Zhordania believed that European socialism was leading the proletariat towards the factories, so the political actions had to be based on that type of proletariat. In addition, he shared the view that the backward countries needed political revolution, democracy, economic development and later the transition to socialism.

He had different views on war tactics in respect to the Russian Marxists. In &quot;Kvali&quot; and &quot;Skhivi&quot;, he thought it was fair to use terror under certain circumstances.
Zhordania had conservative views regarding the role of families and believed that a person&#x27;s main objective was to have family and procreate.

=== The agrarian issue ===
To better understand the ideology of Marxism, he traveled to Switzerland, France, Germany and England, where he became part of several European socialist parties. What he discovered was that the structure of the European society was considerably different from the Georgian one.

He was foremost interested in agrarian issues. In Europe, the peasant was considered a private owner, and the petty bourgeoisie was subjected to state taxes, unlike the aristocracy. In Georgia it was the opposite: because of that, the peasants and the landlords monarchists were opposed. The agrarian question was, for Zhordania, a central issue. In contrast to the European and Russian Social Democratic Movements, which sought political change through the industrial proletariat, Zhordania believed that farmers were the leading force in the revolutionary movement.

=== National issue ===

Unlike Georgia, Western European countries had a settled national identity already, so Zhordania could not find anything useful from their programs: it was in Poland that he was introduced to the idea of a nationalist movement. At the beginning of 1896, in a letter to Karl Kautsky regarding Polish autonomy, Zhordania&#x27;s viewpoint came to life. He thought that Marxism does not deny the national issue and the national struggle for freedom.

He did not believe that the promotion of the national issue came first. Subsequently, he opposed the Social-federalist movement. According to him Georgia was a young nation, whose national consciousness was only born at the end of the 19th century. In his view, Russia had brought in Georgia a higher political-economic system, namely capitalism. In addition to that, he felt that, since the local peasants were against landlords, by putting the national issue in front he would lose the support from the peasantry, and by losing them the revolutionary movement would be endangered. He supported only the cultural autonomy of nations. 
During World War I he was particularly opposed to the national issue. He considered it a physical threat to the nation. He thought that the country should show commitment to Russia, otherwise the whole government would be under threat. This idea was strengthened during Russia&#x27;s punitive expedition in Adjara. In Zhordania&#x27;s view, the party should not bear the responsibility for separatism.
While the Social-Democratic Party did not have common understanding on the national issues, Zhordania personally did not question Georgia&#x27;s independence: his vision was based only on tactical considerations. After the October Revolution, Zhordania&#x27;s view changed in regards to the nationalist stance.

== Family ==
In 1904, Noe Zhordania married Ina Koreneva, a party comrade (1877–1967). The couple had four children: Asmat, Nina, Redjeb, and Andreika. The daughter of Asmat Zhordania and Levan Pagava, Ethéry Pagava, would become a famous ballerina in France. Nina married Archil Tsitsishvili and had three daughters and five grandchildren. Andreika died in Georgia, while Redjeb Zhordania has one son, two daughters, and lives in New York, where he is a lecturer on French civilization.
Zhordania&#x27;s relative, Nina Gegechkori, was Lavrenti Beria&#x27;s wife.

<doc id="427435" wikidata="Q1142176" url="?curid=427435" title="National Patriotic Party">
<text>The National Patriotic Party (NPP) is a political party in Liberia. It was formed in 1997 by members of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia following the end of the First Liberian Civil War.

==History==
The party contested the 1997 general election, with the NPFL&#x27;s leader, Charles Taylor, serving as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Taylor won the presidential election with 75% of the vote. The party also won 49 of 64 seats in the House of Representatives and 21 of 26 in the Senate. Due to domestic and international pressure as a result of the Second Liberian Civil War, Taylor stepped down as president in August 2003. In October of that year, Taylor&#x27;s successor, Moses Blah, and the members of the Legislature resigned and ceded power to the National Transitional Government of Liberia.

The party later contested the 2005 general election. The party&#x27;s presidential candidate was Roland Massaquoi, who earned 4.1% of the vote. The NPP also won four seats in the House of Representatives and another four in the Senate.

The party was a member of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) during the 2011 Liberian general election, and joined the CDC&#x27;s boycott of the runoff election in protest due to partisan politicians being named to the National Elections Commission (NEC) and demanding the resignation of NEC Chairman James Fromayan.

===2016 convention===
The party&#x27;s 2016 convention was held in Buchanan, Liberia. The main topic was the influence held by Jewel Howard-Taylor, who served in an official capacity as the party&#x27;s &quot;Standard Bearer.&quot; Prior to the convention she was able to negotiate a coalition with George Weah&#x27;s CDC to see Taylor elected Vice President of Liberia during the 2017 Liberian general election. Additionally, she also organized a meeting to change the party&#x27;s constitution, greatly enhancing her powers to basically rule the NPP by decree. 

During the 2017 election it was found that Charles Taylor was continuing to guide the party via phone calls from prison. Weah and the NPP party structure denied this, stating that Charles Taylor has no influence over Weah, the NPP, or his ex-wife Jewel Howard-Taylor.

In 2018, party chairman James Biney, angered by Taylor&#x27;s meddling with the party, issued a resolution expelling Taylor, as well as John Gray, who she installed as chairman, from the party, and recommending to George Weah to remove her from the position of Vice President. Biney has made it clear that his faction of the NPP is unhappy with their position in the CDC and the CDC&#x27;s continued support of Taylor and her faction of the NPP as opposed to the legitimate faction and leadership of the NPP and threatened the CDC with their withdrawal. This has led to a split in many county affiliates, namely the Maryland County branch developing two rival leaderships, one supporting Taylor and another supporting Biney. In 2019 the CDC seriously considered removing Taylor from the office of vice president, with Mulbah Morlu, chairman of the Congress for Democratic Change suggesting she be replaced with the Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nathaniel McGill, however, backed off following backlash from the pro-Taylor NPP, namely chairwoman of the NPP&#x27;s woman wing and Bong County superintendent Esther Walker, and the NPP Bong county chairman James Dorbor Sao and vice chairman for administration Paul Wheeler.

In 2020 Agnes Reeves Taylor, ex-wife of Charles Taylor, returned to Liberia after the dismissal of her war crime charges. Biney&#x27;s NPP welcomed her return with a parade and a rally, championing her as the &quot;true mother&quot; of the NPP, and seeking to tap her for a leadership role to mitigate the influence of Jewel Howard-Taylor.

In 2021, following the sudden death of Emmanuel Barten Nyeswua, the Youth Council of the NPP, which are vocal and often militant supporters of Jewel-Taylor, petitioned George Weah to name a pro-Taylor member of the NPP, Clarence Williams, as chairman of the Internal Audit Agency to show unity between the NPP and CDC. Instead Weah named David A. Kemah, a non-partisan, as the new chairman.

===2022 convention and split===
In 2022 the NEC ruled that Chairman Biney&#x27;s term should have expired after his four year term in 2020, and that his tenure was without legitimacy. In response, Biney coordinated the party&#x27;s 7th party convention in October in Paynesville, Liberia. Despite calls from the NEC to have the Biney and Taylor factions put their differences aside Democratically at the convention, Taylor and her supporters instead organized a rival convention. Inside the city hall Biney was re-elected as chairman, while the rival convention held outside by Jewel Howard-Taylor declared all seats in the party&#x27;s executive to be vacant and elected Stanley Kparkillen as the new party chairman. A fight would break out between the two convention goers with at least one death. Taylor&#x27;s faction of the party argued that as standard bearer, Taylor is the sole authority to vet and approve members of the party to participate in the Weah government, and shortly after the convention declared that the NPP would be supporting the CDC with Taylor again as Weah&#x27;s running mate. Chairman Emeritus of the party, Chief Cyril Allen, denounced the 7th party convention as &quot;complete gangsterism&quot; and accused Taylor of paying attendees to sign a resolution against Biney and the NPP party structure. In March of 2022 the Supreme Court of Liberia found in favor of Biney, that Jewel Howard-Taylor had no official powers to call a party convention, and that the 2016 party constitution was declared null and void and that Biney is the rightful leader of the party.

The CDC has largely supported the attempted takeover of the party by Taylor&#x27;s faction, with Weah&#x27;s advisor on communications, Gabriel Nyenkan, arguing that the NPP should be grateful to the CDC for allowing them to participate in the government, and that the NPP as a stand alone political party &quot;had become a striped frame of a vehicle and could bring nothing to the table.&quot; The Liberian government, despite the supreme court ruling, has recognized Taylor&#x27;s faction as the party leadership. 

In 2023 Taylor named Joe Mulbah as &quot;acting chairman&quot; of her faction of the NPP who suspended chairman James Biney from the party, who, in turn, nullified his own suspension and suspended Taylor and Mulbah. The cause of the renewed dispute is Biney&#x27;s refusal to sign a resolution to commit the party to the Coalition for Democratic Change against the wishes of the party&#x27;s executive committee, which Taylor argued is a violation of article 4 of the party&#x27;s 2004 Constitution. However, Biney argued that Taylor had no authority to suspend the chairman, and that by attempting to do so violated article 5 of the party&#x27;s 2004 Constitution and that Taylor and Mulbah were &quot;convening an illegal and unconstitutional gathering.&quot; Biney has also gone on saying that the committee gathering to call for signing of the CDC resolution was illegitimate as meetings of the party&#x27;s executive committee can only be called and presided over by the party chairman.

Shortly after the &quot;suspension&quot; of Biney, Taylor organized members of the NPP Youth Council to protest for a war crimes trail for Prince Johnson while he was purportedly giving a sermon against Taylor which prompted the congregation to evacuate out of fear of a violent escalation. In response Johnson began surrounding his church with armed supporters and threatened a violent response should Taylor continue to push for protests against him. Most opposition parties to the CDC used the event as an opportunity to criticize Taylor, Weah and the NPP as a whole.

<text>The Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) is one of the two major political parties in Sierra Leone, along with its main political rival the All People&#x27;s Congress (APC). It has been the ruling party in Sierra Leone since 4 April 2018. The SLPP dominated Sierra Leone&#x27;s politics from its foundation in 1951 to 1967, when it lost the 1967 parliamentary election to the APC, led by Siaka Stevens. Originally a centre-right, conservative party, it identifies since 2012 as a centre-left social democratic party, with a centrist tendency. 

The SLPP returned to power when its leader Ahmad Tejan Kabbah won the 1996 presidential election. The party was in power from 1996 to 2007, when it again lost to the APC, led by Ernest Bai Koroma, in the 2007 presidential election. SLPP returned to power on 4 April 2018 when Julius Maada Bio was sworn in as the new President of Sierra Leone after winning the 2018 Sierra Leone presidential election. 

SLPP is overwhelmingly popular in Mende areas in south and eastern Sierra Leone (except in Kono District, a swing district), where the party regularly wins presidential, parliamentary and local elections by large margins. The SLPP has large minority support in the Western Area (including Freetown). The SLPP also has large minority support in Koinadugu District and Falaba District in the north of the country. The SLPP also has significant minority support in Kambia District in the north of the country.

== Early success and Independence ==
SLPP dominated politics in Sierra Leone in the years following World War II. In 1955 and 1956, riots occurred in Sierra Leone, originally sparked by the artisan union&#x27;s strike over pay; further unrest followed strikes by transport workers. These events grew animosity between the SLPP and Krio parties, especially the Cyril Rogers-Wright led United Sierra Leone Progressive Party, established in 1954. The SLPP positioned itself as &quot;the countryman&#x27;s party,&quot; and garnered the support of tribal chiefs. In recent times however, the SLPP has been widely perceived as &quot;the Mende man&#x27;s party&quot;.

After elections in 1957, Milton Margai bowed to behind-the-scenes pressure and stepped down from SLPP leadership, replaced by his brother Albert Margai. However, in 1958, Albert Margai and Siaka Stevens launched a new party, the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP), which aimed for greater African involvement in the British colonial government. With the independence of Ghana in 1957, the PNP sought the support of the educated elite to lead a transition to independence. Stevens would later leave the party to form the northern-supported All Peoples Congress. Upon independence in 1961, Milton Margai became prime minister, and the SLPP became the ruling party. The SLPP, along with almost all Sierra Leonean political parties, signed the constitution at the London constitutional conference; the APC was the notable exception. This unity did not extend to national politics, as opposing politicians often faced detainment under SLPP rule.

== Demise ==
Sir Milton Margai&#x27;s death in 1964 left SLPP leadership to his brother Sir Albert Margai. Albert&#x27;s rule was characterized by dissent. Politically, he attempted to strengthen the position of SLPP elites relative to the chiefs, who had formed the backbone of the party. Albert&#x27;s autocratic leadership style was questioned within his party, sparked by actions such as the demotion of senior party members Alhaji M.S. Mustapha and Kerefa Smart. Albert also embarked on a policy of Africanisation, which removed some civil servants who favored a colonialistic approach. Margai may have adopted this strategy in an effort to replace the 
Creole civil administrators with unqualified members of his Mende tribe. Sir Albert Margai took power and sought to make the army homogeneously Mende.
He also endeavoured to change Sierra Leone from a democracy to a one-party state. 

Scores of schools were built in the provinces along with Teachers Colleges in every district (Makeni, Magburaka, Moyamba, and the Milton Margai Teachers College).

Opposing leaders criticized Margai&#x27;s presentation of a bill to establish a one-party system in Sierra Leone and also blamed Margai for developments had led to an economic slowdown. In the 1967 elections, the APC and SLPP each won 32 seats in parliament, with 2 former SLPP Independents siding with the APC MPs Kutubu Kai-Samba and Luseni A. M Brewah. This development confirmed that the SLPP would no longer lead the country.

The subsequent political unrest led to the declaration of martial law and a military coup that took full control of the national government. The National Reformation Council (NRC), led by Brigadier Andrew Juxon-Smith, was established on 23 March 1967. Pressure from political elites, trade unions, and university students led to the junta&#x27;s collapse in November 1970, and Siaka Stevens of the APC became president after the interregnum.

Under Stevens, Sierra Leone became a one-party state. In 1978 all SLPP MPs except one (Manna Kpaka, MP in Kenema) joined the APC. The SLPP was outlawed, and its elites and supporters were physically threatened and barred from holding meetings.

== Rebirth ==
In 1996 SLPP returned to prominence, as its candidate Ahmad Tejan Kabbah won the presidential election, receiving 59.5% of the popular vote in a second round against John Karefa-Smart of the United National People&#x27;s Party (UNPP). In the election held on 14 May 2002, the party won 69.9% of the popular vote and 83 out of 112 seats in the House of Representatives, and its candidate in the presidential election, Kabbah, won 70.1% of the vote and was re-elected.

At the SLPP&#x27;s national convention in Makeni on 3–4 September 2005, Vice-President Solomon Berewa was selected by the SLPP as its leader and 2007 presidential candidate. He received 291 votes, while Charles Margai received 34, Julius Maada Bio received 33, and J. B. Dauda received 28. In the August 2007 election, the SLPP was defeated by the APC in the parliamentary election, winning 43 seats against 59 for the APC; the PMDC, a splinter party founded by Charles Margai, attracted the support of some traditional SLPP voters, winning 10 seats. In the presidential election, the SLPP candidate, Berewa, took second place in the first round, winning 38.3% of the vote against 44.3% for the APC candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma. A second round of the presidential election was held in September; Koroma prevailed with 54.6% of the vote against 45.4% for Berewa.

The SLPP constitution requires its leader to resign if the party loses a national election; Berewa resigned as party leader on 17 October 2007, leaving Alhaji Sulaiman Jah as acting leader. In 2011, Julius Maada Bio became SLPP&#x27;s nominee for the 2012 presidential election. He beat Usman Boie Kamara, who came in second place. Bio was nominated as the SLPP candidate for president in the 2018 election, which he ultimately won.

=== Julius Maada Bio presidency (2018–present) ===

In 2018, Sierra Leone held a general election. The presidential election, in which neither candidate reached the required threshold of 55%, went to a second round of voting, in which Julius Maada Bio was elected with 51% of the vote against the candidate of then-ruling All People’s Congress (APC). On 4 April 2018, opposition candidate Julius Maada Bio of Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP), was sworn in as Sierra Leone’s new president.

<text>The National Resistance Movement (; abbr. NRM) has been the ruling party in Uganda since 1986.

==History==
 The National Resistance Movement (NRM) was founded as a liberation movement that waged a guerrilla war through its rebel wing National Resistance Army (NRA) that toppled the government in 1986. According to the National Resistance Movement, it restored political stability, security, law and order, constitutionalism and the rule of law to Uganda.

==Leadership==
The party&#x27;s leader, Yoweri Museveni, was involved in the war that deposed Idi Amin, ending his rule in 1979, and in the rebellion that subsequently led to the demise of the Milton Obote regime in 1985; however, parallels have been drawn between the NRM and its predecessors in terms of suppressing fundamental freedoms. For instance, the NRM-sponsored Public Order Management Bill is strikingly similar to the 1967 Public Order and Security Act, codified by the Obote regime, in that both bills &quot;seek to gag dissenting views.&quot; Museveni&#x27;s statements are also reminiscent of Uganda&#x27;s dictatorial past: &quot;Whoever tries to cause problems, we finish them. Besigye [an opposition leader] tried to disorganize Kampala and we gave him a little tear gas and he calmed down. He didn&#x27;t need a bullet, just a little gas.&quot; Further, as he once stated that &quot;the problem of Africa in general and Uganda in particular is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power,&quot; some have viewed his move to abolish presidential term limits as hypocritical. In the past, The NRM has been praised for bringing relative stability and economic growth to a country that has endured decades of government mismanagement, rebel activity and civil war; however, with an unemployment rate of 62% among the youth, his economic effectiveness has seriously come into question. His tenure has witnessed one of the most effective national responses to HIV/AIDS in Africa.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Museveni was lauded by the West as part of a new generation of African leaders. His presidency has been marred, however, by invading and occupying Congo during the Second Congo War (the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which has resulted in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998) and other conflicts in the Great Lakes region. Recent developments, including the abolition of presidential term limits before the 2006 elections, Museveni&#x27;s confirmation of the NRM-sponsored Public Order Management Bill — a bill which severely limits freedom of assembly — NRM media censorship and the persecution of democratic opposition (i.e. general intimidation of voters by security forces; arresting opposition candidates; extrajudicial killings) have attracted concern from domestic and foreign commentators. Most recently, indicators of an alleged succession to the President&#x27;s son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, have increased tensions.

Allegations regarding significant corruption have also shaped criticism of the NRM government. According to the U.S. State Department&#x27;s 2012 Human Rights Report on Uganda, &quot;The World Bank&#x27;s most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected corruption was a severe problem&quot; and that &quot;the country annually loses 768.9 billion shillings ($286 million) to corruption.&quot; Understandably, Uganda was ranked 140th out of 176 nations on the Corruption Perceptions Index. A specific scandal, which had significant international consequences and highlighted the presence of corruption in high-level government offices, was the embezzlement of $12.6 mil in donor funds from the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012. These funds were &quot;earmarked as crucial support for rebuilding northern Uganda, ravaged by a 20-year war, and Karamoja, Uganda&#x27;s poorest region.&quot; This scandal prompted the E.U., The U.K., Germany, Denmark, Ireland and Norway to suspend aid. What may compound this problem — as it does in many developing nations (as per the resource curse) — is an abundance of oil.

The Petroleum Bill — passed by the Ugandan Parliament in 2012 — which was touted by the NRM as bringing transparency to the oil sector has, failed to please domestic and international political commentators and economists. For instance, Angelo Izama, a Ugandan energy analyst at the U.S.-based Open Society Foundation said the new law was tantamount to &quot;handing over an ATM (cash) machine&quot; to Museveni and his regime. According to Global Witness, an international law NGO, Uganda now has &quot;oil reserves that have the potential to double the government&#x27;s revenue within six to ten years, worth an estimated US$2.4bn per year.&quot;

Other contentious bills have been sponsored, passed and confirmed by the NRM government during his tenure. For example, The Non Governmental Organizations (Amendment) Act, passed in 2006, has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry, activity, funding and assembly within the sector. Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures (i.e. requiring recommendations from government officials; annual re-registration), unreasonable regulation of operations (i.e. requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO&#x27;s area of interest), and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda, among other things, are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector. Furthermore, the sector&#x27;s freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation, and the recent Public Order Management Bill (severely limiting freedom of assembly) will only add to the government&#x27;s stockpile of ammunition.

==Electoral performance==
The party began as the political body associated with the rebel National Resistance Army before Museveni came to power in 1986. Until a referendum in 2005, Uganda held elections on a non-party basis. The NRM currently has a majority in the Ugandan parliament, a position it has maintained since 1996. The presidential elections of 12 March 2001 were won by Yoweri Museveni of the NRM with 69.3% of the popular vote.

On 17 November 2005, Museveni was elected unopposed as NRM&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2006 elections.

In the general election of 23 February 2006, the party won 205 out of 289 elected seats. In the presidential election of the same date, Museveni won 59.3% of the vote.

In the 2016 general election, the party won 293 out of 426 seats, and Museveni was reelected president with 56.62% of the vote.

== Mbabazi split ==
National Resistance Movement secretary general Hon. Amama Mbabazi fell out with party chairman Yoweri Museveni just before 2016 general elections. Museveni sacked Mbabazi for having declared interest in running against him to the party chairmanship. Mbabazi left and formed his political movement the GO FORWARD group.

<doc id="427439" wikidata="Q897701" url="?curid=427439" title="Service Location Protocol">
<text>The Service Location Protocol (SLP, srvloc) is a service discovery protocol that allows computers and other devices to find services in a local area network without prior configuration. SLP has been designed to scale from small, unmanaged networks to large enterprise networks. It has been defined in RFC 2608 and RFC 3224 as standards track document.

== Overview ==
SLP is used by devices to announce &quot;services&quot; on a local network. Each service must have a URL that is used to locate the service. Additionally it may have an unlimited number of name/value pairs, called &quot;attributes&quot;. Each device must always be in one or more &quot;scopes&quot;. Scopes are simple strings and are used to group services, comparable to the &quot;network neighborhood&quot; in other systems. A device cannot see services that are in different scopes.

The URL of a printer could look like:
 service:printer:lpr://myprinter/myqueue

This URL describes a queue called &quot;myqueue&quot; on a printer with the host name &quot;myprinter&quot;. The protocol used by the printer is LPR. Note that a special URL scheme &quot;service:&quot; is used by the printer. &quot;service:&quot; URLs are not required: any URL scheme can be used, but they allow you to search for all services of the same type (e.g. all printers) regardless of the protocol that they use. The first three components of the &quot;service:&quot; URL type (&quot;service:printer:lpr&quot;) are also called &quot;service type&quot;. The first two components (&quot;service:printer&quot;) are called &quot;abstract service type&quot;. In a non-&quot;service:&quot; URL the schema name is the service type (for instance &quot;http&quot; in &quot;http://www.wikipedia.org&quot;).

The attributes of the printer could look like:
 (printer-name=Hugo),
 (printer-natural-language-configured=en-us),
 (printer-location=In my home office),
 (printer-document-format-supported=application/postscript),
 (printer-color-supported=false),
 (printer-compression-supported=deflate, gzip)
The example uses the standard syntax for attributes in SLP, only newlines have been added to improve readability.

The definition of a &quot;service:&quot; URL and the allowed attributes for the URL are specified by a &quot;service template&quot;, a formalized description of the URL syntax and the attributes. Service templates are defined in RFC 2609.

SLP allows several query types to locate services and obtain information about them:
* It can search for all services with the same service type or abstract service type
* The query can be combined with a query for attributes, using LDAP&#x27;s query language.
* Given its URL, the attributes of a service can be requested. In standard SLP the attributes are not returned in the query result and must be fetched separately. The Attribute List Extension (RFC 3059) fixes this problem.
* A list of all service types can be obtained
* A list of all existing scopes can be requested.

== Roles ==
SLP has three different roles for devices. A device can also have two or all three roles at the same time.
* &quot;User Agents&quot; (UA) are devices that search for services
* &quot;Service Agents&quot; (SA) are devices that announce one or more services
* &quot;Directory Agents&quot; (DA) are devices that cache services information. They are used in larger networks to reduce the amount of traffic and allow SLP to scale. The existence of DAs in a network is optional, but if a DA is present, UAs and SAs are required to use it instead of communicating directly.

Today most implementations are daemons that can act both as UA and SA. Usually they can be configured to become a DA as well.

== Network protocol ==
SLP is a packet-oriented protocol. Most packets are transmitted using UDP, but TCP can also be used for the transmission of longer packets. Because of the potential unreliability of UDP, SLP repeats all multicasts several times in increasing intervals until an answer has been received. 
All devices are required to listen on port 427 for UDP packets, SAs and DAs should also listen for TCP on the same port. Multicasting is used extensively by SLP, especially by devices that join a network and need to find other devices.

The operation of SLP differs considerably, depending on whether a Directory Agent (DA) is in the network or not. When a client first joins a network it multicasts a query for DAs on the network. If no DA answers it will assume that it is in a network without DAs. It is also possible to add DAs later, as they multicast a &#x27;heartbeat&#x27; packet in a predefined interval that will be received by all other devices. When an SA discovers a DA, it is required to register all services at the DA. When a service disappears the SA should notify the DA and unregister it.

In order to send a query in a network without a DA, the UA sends a multicast UDP packet that contains the query. All SAs that contain matches will send a UDP answer to the UA. If the answer is too large to fit into a single UDP packet, the packet will be marked as &quot;overflown&quot; and the UA is free to send the query directly to the SA using TCP, which can transmit packets of any size.

In order to send a query in a network with a DA, the UA will send the query packet to the DA using either UDP or TCP. As every SA must register all services with the DA, the DA is able to fulfill the request completely and simply sends the result back to the UA.

== Security ==
SLP contains a security mechanism, based on public-key cryptography, that allows signing of service announcements. In practice it is rarely used:
* The public keys of every service provider must be installed on every UA. This requirement defeats the original purpose of SLP, being able to locate services without prior configuration.
* Protecting only the services is not enough. Service URLs contain host names or IP addresses, and in a local network it is almost impossible to prevent IP or DNS spoofing. Thus only guaranteeing the authenticity of the URL is not enough if any device can respond to the address.
* As addresses can be spoofed, the authenticity of the device must be proven at a different level anyway, e.g. in the application protocol (e.g. with SSL) or in the packet layer (IPsec). Doing it additionally in SLP does not provide much additional security.

== Adoption ==
* SLP is frequently used for locating printers and supported by printing systems such as CUPS.
* SLP is often found in LAN-enabled printers, so that they are discoverable out of the box. Some client print drivers can use this for printer discovery.
* ACN, a protocol being developed for entertainment control, uses SLP to find different devices such as dimmers and intelligent lights.
* Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X up to version 10.1 used SLP to locate file shares and other services. However, features introduced with Mac OS X (version 10.2 onwards) use Zeroconf.
* Netware Core Protocol (NCP) clients in a pure IP environment use SLP to locate Novell NetWare and Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES) servers.
* SUSE Linux supports SLP for a variety of services since version 9.1.
* Sun Microsystems supports SLPv1 and SLPv2 including SA, UA and DA functionality.
* The Distributed Management Task Force has standardized discovery of WBEM Services via SLP.
* The Storage Networking Industry Association has mandated the use of SLP for services discovery in the Storage Management Initiative - Specification.

<text>Chiatura () is a city in the Imereti region of Western Georgia. In 1989, it had a population of about 30,000. The city is known for its system of cable cars connecting the city&#x27;s center to the mining settlements on the surrounding hills.
The city is located inland, in a mountain valley on the banks of the Qvirila River.

==Geography and history==

In 1879 the Georgian poet Akaki Tsereteli explored the area in search of manganese and iron ores, discovering deposits in the area. After other intense explorations it was discovered that there are several layers of commercially exploitable manganese oxide, peroxide and carbonate with thickness varying between and . The state set up the JSC Chiaturmanganese company to manage and exploit the huge deposit. 

The gross-balance of workable manganese ores of all commercial categories is estimated as 239 million tonnes, which include manganese oxide ores (41.6%), carbonate ores (39%), and peroxide ores (19%). In order to transport manganese ore to the ferro-alloy plant in Zestaponi the company developed a rail link which, operated today by Georgian Railways, is fully electrified. Manganese production rose to 60% of global output by 1905.

In Chiatura are located the Tsereteli State Theater, 10 schools, Faculty of the Georgian Technical University, and the Mgvimevi Cathedral (10th-11th centuries). During the 1905 Russian Revolution Chiatura was the only Bolshevik stronghold in mostly Menshevik Georgia. 3,700 miners worked 18 hours a day sleeping in the mines, always covered in soot. They didn&#x27;t even have baths. Joseph Stalin persuaded them to back Bolshevism during a debate with the Mensheviks. They preferred his simple 15-minute speech to his rivals&#x27; oratory. They called him &quot;sergeant major Koba&quot;. He set up a printing press, protection racket and &quot;red battle squads&quot;. Stalin put Vano Kiasashvili in charge of the armed miners. The mine owners actually sheltered him as he would protect them from thieves in return and he destroyed mines whose owners refused to pay up.

In 1906, a gold train carrying the miners&#x27; wages was attacked by Kote Tsintsadze&#x27;s Druzhina (Bolshevik Expropriators&#x27; Club). They fought for two hours, killing a gendarme and a soldier and stealing 21,000 roubles.
The miners went on a successful 55-day strike in June–July 1913. They demanded an 8-hour day, higher wages and no more night work. The police allowed the RSDRP to lead the strike provided that they did not make any political demands. They were supported by fellow strikers in Batumi and Poti.

In 2017, &quot;City of the Sun&quot;, a documentary film directed by Rati Oneli, follows a number of citizens of the city.

==Cablecars==

Due to the steep sided river valley, production workers spent a large amount of time walking up from the town to the mines, thereby reducing productivity. In 1954 an extensive cable car system was installed to transport workers around the valley and up to the mines. The system&#x27;s 17 lines continued to serve the city using original hardware until 2021.

In 2017, the Georgian government began rebuilding the system using modern cable car technology, beginning with the central four-line hub station. The revamped system opened in September 2021. The original Soviet-era system was deemed unsafe and taken out of service. The government plans to preserve its stations as heritage sites.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Chiatura is twinned with:

* Keila, Estonia
* Murgul, Turkey
* Sigulda, Latvia

<doc id="427445" wikidata="Q128007" url="?curid=427445" title="Hoof">
<text>The hoof (: hooves) is the tip of a toe of an ungulate mammal, which is covered and strengthened with a thick and horny keratin covering. Artiodactyls are even-toed ungulates, species whose feet have an even number of digits; the ruminants with two digits are the most numerous, e.g. giraffe, deer, bison, cattle, goats, gazelles, pigs, and sheep. The feet of perissodactyl mammals have an odd number of toes, e.g. the horse, the rhinoceros, and the tapir. Although hooves are limb structures primarily found in placental mammals, hadrosaurs such as &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; possessed hoofed forelimbs. The marsupial &quot;Chaeropus&quot; also had hooves.

== Description ==

The hoof surrounds the distal end of the second phalanx, the distal phalanx, and the navicular bone. The hoof consists of the hoof wall, the bars of the hoof, the sole and frog and soft tissue shock absorption structures. The weight of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves perform many functions, including supporting the weight of the animal, dissipating the energy impact as the hooves strike the ground or surface, protecting the tissues and bone within the hoof capsule, and providing traction for the animal. Numerous factors can affect hoof structure and health, including genetics, hoof conformation, environmental influences, and athletic performance of the animal. The ideal hoof has a parallel hoof-pastern axis, a thick hoof wall, adequate sole depth, a solid heel base and growth rings of equal size under the coronary band.

There are four layers within the exterior wall of the hoof. From the outside, a hoof is made up of the stratum externum, the stratum medium, the stratum internum and the dermis parietis. The stratum externum and the stratum medium are difficult to distinguish, the stratum externum is thin and the stratum medium is what makes up the bulk of the hoof wall. Inside the hoof wall is a laminar junction, a soft tissue structure that allows the hoof to withstand the demands of force transmission it undergoes. This tissue structure binds the inner surface of the hoof wall, the dermis parietis and the outer surface of the third phalanx.

Most even-toed ungulates (such as sheep, goats, deer, cattle, bison and pigs) have two main hooves on each foot, together called a cloven hoof. Most of these cloven-hooved animals also have two smaller hooves called dewclaws a little further up the leg – these are not normally used for walking, but in some species with larger dewclaws (such as deer and pigs) they may touch the ground when running or jumping, or if the ground is soft. In the mountain goat, the dewclaw serves to provide extra traction when descending rocky slopes as well as additional drag on loose or slippery surfaces made of ice, dirt, or snow. Other cloven-hooved animals (such as giraffes and pronghorns) have no dewclaws.

In some so-called &quot;cloven-hooved&quot; animals, such as camels, the &quot;hoof&quot; is not properly a hoof – it is not a hard or rubbery sole with a hard wall formed by a thick nail – instead it is a soft toe with little more than a nail merely having an appearance of a hoof.

Some odd-toed ungulates (equids) have one hoof on each foot; others have (or had) three distinct hooved or heavily nailed toes, or one hoof and two dewclaws. The tapir is a special case, having three toes on each hind foot and four toes on each front foot.

==Management==

Hooves grow continuously. In nature, wild animals are capable of wearing down the hoof as it continuously grows, but captive domesticated species often must undergo specific hoof care for a healthy, functional hoof. Proper care improves biomechanical efficiency and prevents lameness. If not worn down enough by use, such as in the dairy industry, hooves may need to be trimmed. However, too much wear can result in damage of the hooves, and for this reason, horseshoes and oxshoes are used by animals that routinely walk on hard surfaces and carry heavy weight.

=== Horses ===
Within the equine world, the expression, &quot;no foot, no horse&quot; emphasizes the importance of hoof health. Hoof care is important in the equine industry. Problems that can arise with poor horse hoof care include hoof cracks, thrush, abscesses and laminitis.

===Cattle===

A cow hoof is cloven, or divided, into two approximately equal parts, usually called claws. Approximately 95% of lameness in dairy cattle occurs in the feet. Lameness in dairy cows can reduce milk production and fertility, and cause reproductive problems and suffering. For dairy farm profitability, lameness, behind only infertility and mastitis, is the third most important cow health issue.

Hoof trimmers trim and care for bovine hooves, usually dairy cows. Hooves can be trimmed with a sharp knife while the cow is restrained and positioned with ropes. Professional hoof-trimming tend to use angle grinders and some type of hoof trimming crush to make the process quicker and less physically demanding on the hoof trimmer. A hoof trimmer using modern machinery may trim the hooves of more than 10,000 cows per year. The trimmer shapes the hooves to provide the optimal weight-bearing surface. A freshly trimmed hoof may be treated with copper sulfate pentahydrate to prevent foot rot.

Hooves have historical significance in ceremonies and games. They have been used in burial ceremonies.

<text>Kutaisi ( , ) is a city in the Imereti region of the Republic of Georgia. One of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, it is the third-most populous city in Georgia after Tbilisi and Batumi. It lies west of Tbilisi, on the Rioni River, and is the capital of Imereti.

Historically one of the major cities of Georgia, it served as the political center of Colchis in the Middle Ages as the capital of the Kingdom of Abkhazia and Kingdom of Georgia and later as the capital of the Kingdom of Imereti. From October 2012 to December 2018, Kutaisi was the seat of the Parliament of Georgia as an effort to decentralize the Georgian government.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that the city functioned as the capital of the Colchis in the sixth to fifth centuries BC. It is believed that, in &quot;Argonautica&quot;, a Greek epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their journey to Colchis, author Apollonius Rhodius considered Kutaisi their final destination as well as the residence of King Aeëtes.
Later, it was the capital of the kingdom of Lazica until being occupied briefly by the Arabs. An Arab invasion into western Georgia was repelled by Abkhazians jointly with Lazic and Iberian allies in 736, towards c.786, Leon II won his full independence from the Byzantine Empire and transferred his capital to Kutaisi, thus unifying Lazica and Abasgia via a dynastic union. The latter led the unification of the Georgian monarchy in the 11th century.

From 1008 to 1122, Kutaisi served as the capital of the Kingdom of Georgia, and, from the 15th century until 1810, it was the capital of the Kingdom of Imereti. In 1508, the city was conquered by Selim I, who was the son of Bayezid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.

During the 17th century, Imeretian kings made many appeals to the Russian Empire to help them in their struggle for independence from the Ottomans. All these appeals were ignored as Russia did not want to spoil relations with the Ottomans. Only in the reign of Catherine the Great, in 1768, were troops of general Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben sent to join the forces of King Heraclius II of Georgia, who hoped to reconquer the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, with Russian help. Totleben helped King Solomon I of Imereti to recover his capital, Kutaisi, on August 6, 1770.
Finally, the Russian-Turkish wars ended in 1810 with the annexation of the Imeretian Kingdom by the Russian Empire. The city was the administrative capital of the Kutaisi uezd and the larger Kutaisi Governorate, which included much of west Georgia. 

In March 1879, the city was the site of a blood libel trial that attracted attention all over the Russian Empire. Nine Georgian Jews from Sachkhere were falsely accused of killing a Christian girl and using her blood for allegedly Jewish religious purposes. The trial took place at the Kutaisi Circuit Court, which had been established in 1868 as one of several new courts in the Caucasus created by Tsar Alexander II.&#x27;s Judicial Reform. After a ten-day trial, with nearly 70 witnesses, the nine defendants were acquitted as the defense lawyers Petr Aleksandrov, Lev Kupernik and Moisei Kikodze convinced the judges that the accusations against the Jewish men were mostly based on false testimony.

Kutaisi was a major industrial center before Georgia&#x27;s independence on 9 April 1991. Independence was followed by the economic collapse of the country, and, as a result, many inhabitants of Kutaisi have had to work abroad. Small-scale trade prevails among the rest of the population.

In 2011, Mikheil Saakashvili, the president of Georgia, signed a constitutional amendment relocating the parliament to Kutaisi. On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated the new Parliament building in Kutaisi. This was done in an effort to decentralize power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia, although it has been criticized as marginalizing the legislature, and also for the demolition of a Soviet War Memorial formerly at the new building&#x27;s location. The subsequent government of the Georgian Dream passed a new constitution that moved the parliament back to Tbilisi, effective from January 2019.

==Culture==

It is named after two saints, brothers David and Constantine. They were the Dukes of Margveti, and were martyred by Arab invaders in the 8th  century. Besides the churches, there are other places of note such as: Sataplia Cave, where one can observe footprints of dinosaurs; ruins of Geguti Palace, which was one of the residences of Georgian monarchs; &quot;Okros Chardakhi&quot; – Georgian Kings&#x27; Palace; the Pantheon, where many notable citizens are buried.

== Economy ==

Kutaisi has traditionally been an important industrial center in Georgia, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union most of the old manufacturing lines either stopped working or had to greatly reduce their operations. Nevertheless, the city continues to be an important regional center for the greater Imereti area, acting as a commercial hub for the surrounding countryside. In recent years, the city has started attracting more investment from various multinational corporations.

The Auto Mechanical Plant, originally established in 1945, is located in Kutaisi.

The Hualing FIZ operates since 2015, and specializes in wood and stone processing, furniture and mattress production and metal construction. Both of the free industrial zones offer multiple incentives to investors such as tax exemptions and reduced barriers for trade.

With a total output of 500 MW per year it is the largest solar panel factory under one roof in Europe.

Al-Husseini went to work for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) upon its establishment in Jerusalem, as deputy manager of the Public Organisation Dept, a post he filled from 1964 to 1965. He later received military training at the Damascus Military College, after which he joined the Palestinian Liberation Army in 1967.

In 1979, Al-Husseini founded and became chairman of the Arab Studies Society. He was also a member of the National Guidance Committee. 

Israel, from 1982 to 1987, repeatedly placed him under house and city arrest. He was imprisoned several times from April 1987 to January 1989, but remained active in the First Intifada.

In 1982, he became a member of the Supreme Muslim Council in Jerusalem. Subsequently, he served as a Palestinian spokesperson, head of the Jerusalem National Council/Palestine, an advisor the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Middle East Peace Conference and subsequent talks, head of the Fatah faction in the West Bank, and Palestinian Authority Minister without Portfolio.

His last post was Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem Affairs for which he was based in East Jerusalem. He died while he was trying to mend relations between the Kuwaiti government and the PLO, which were broken at the time of the 1991 Gulf War.

Al-Husseini was considered a pragmatist by journalists. He taught himself to speak Hebrew and regularly appeared in radio and television shows in Israel to explain the Palestinians&#x27; point of view.

==Death==
Husseini died of a heart attack in Kuwait on 31 May 2001. Following Husseini&#x27;s death, Israeli police seized his headquarters, the Orient House. Husseini was buried in a family tomb in the Khātūniyya (where his grandfather and his father had also been buried), near the Dome of the Rock, in a funeral attended by thousands.

<text>Mary Balogh (born Mary Jenkins on 24 March 1944) is a Welsh-Canadian novelist writing historical romance, born and raised in Swansea. In 1967, she moved to Canada to start a teaching career, married a local coroner and settled in Kipling, Saskatchewan, where she eventually became a school principal. Her debut novel appeared in 1985. Her historical fiction is set in the Regency era (1811–1820) or the wider Georgian era (1714–1830).

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Mary Jenkins was born and raised in Swansea, Wales, daughter of Mildred Double, a homemaker, and Arthur Jenkins, a signwriter and painter. She moved to Canada on a two-year teaching contract in 1967 after leaving university. There, she met and married her Canadian husband Robert Balogh, a coroner and ambulance driver, and settled in the small prairie town of Kipling, Saskatchewan. She taught high-school English for a number of years, and rose to the level of school principal. She has three children and five grandchildren.

===Writing career===
As an adult, Balogh discovered the world of the Regency romance as written by Georgette Heyer. The vast majority of Balogh&#x27;s novels have been set in Regency or Georgian England or Wales. Although she writes historical romances, Mary Balogh&#x27;s heroines are often not &quot;ladies&quot;. Some are courtesans, illegitimate, &quot;fallen&quot; or &quot;ruined&quot; women. All enjoy passion, and often a marriage and/or a sensual connection precedes recognition of love.

Balogh began her writing career in 1983, when she wrote her first novel &quot;A Masked Deception&quot; in the evenings at the kitchen table while home and family functioned around her. &quot;A Masked Deception&quot; was accepted by &quot;Signet&quot; and published in 1985. Mary Balogh won the &quot;Romantic Times&quot; Award for best new Regency writer in that year. She is the author of more than 60 published novels and over 30 novellas, and has been met with critical success.

==Reception==
Balogh has received numerous awards, including a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award for Regency Short Stories in 1993 and has appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list.

==Bibliography==

*Reprinted in the 2003 anthology &quot;Under The Mistletoe&quot; with one new Mary Balogh novella &quot;A Family Christmas&quot;

<doc id="427455" wikidata="Q4705902" url="?curid=427455" title="Alamethicin">
<text>Alamethicin is a channel-forming peptide antibiotic, produced by the fungus &quot;Trichoderma viride&quot;. It belongs to peptaibol peptides which contain the non-proteinogenic amino acid residue Aib (2-aminoisobutyric acid). This residue strongly induces formation of alpha-helical structure. The peptide sequence is

: Ac-Aib-Pro-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Gln-Aib-Val-Aib-Gly-Leu-Aib-Pro-Val-Aib-Aib-Glu-Gln-Phl

where Ac = acetyl, Phl = phenylalaninol, and Aib = 2-Aminoisobutyric acid.

In cell membranes, it forms voltage-dependent ion channels by aggregation of four to six molecules.

== Biosynthesis ==
Alamethicin biosynthesis is hypothesized to be catalyzed by alamethicin synthase, a Nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) first isolated in 1975. Although there are several sequences of the alamethicin peptide accepted, evidence suggests these all follow the general NRPS mechanism with small variations at select amino acids. Beginning with the acylation of the N terminal of the first aminoisobutiric acid on the ALM synthase enzyme by Acetyl-CoA, this is followed by the sequential condensation of amino acids by each modular unit of the synthetase. Amino acids are initially adenylated by an “adenylylation” (A) domain before being attached by a thioester bond to an Acyl Carrier Protein-like Peptidyl carrier protein. The growing chain is attached to the amino acid bearing PCP by the &quot;condensation&quot; (C) domain, followed by another round of the same reactions by the next module.

Assembly is completed by the addition of phenylalaninol, an unusual amino acid-like substrate. Following addition of phenylalaninol the completed peptide chain is cleaved by the thioesterase domain, cleaving the thioester bond and leaving an alcohol.

<text>1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is a disubstituted cyclic α-amino acid in which a cyclopropane ring is fused to the C atom of the amino acid. It is a white solid. Many cyclopropane-substituted amino acids are known, but this one occurs naturally. Like glycine, but unlike most α-amino acids, ACC is not chiral.

==Biochemistry==
ACC is the precursor to the plant hormone ethylene. It is synthesized by the enzyme ACC synthase () from methionine and converted to ethylene by ACC oxidase ().

ACC also exhibits ethylene-independent signaling that plays a critical role in pollination and seed production by activating proteins similar to those involved in nervous system responses in humans and animals. More specifically, ACC signaling promotes secretion of the pollen tube chemoattractant LURE1.2 in ovular sporophytic tissue thus enhancing pollen tube attraction. Additionally, ACC activates Ca2+-containing ion currents via glutamate receptor-like (GLR) channels in root protoplasts.

ACC can be used by soil microorganisms (both bacteria and fungi) as a source of nitrogen and carbon. As such, using ACC to incubate soils has been proven to induce the gene abundance encoding ACC-deaminases, which may have positive consequences on plant growth and stress tolerance. 

ACC has also been extracted from kelp.

ACC is also an exogenous partial agonist of the mammalian NMDA receptor.

In 2019, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued notice of an application for an experimental use permit to be issued for use of ACC as a pesticide.

<text>The Mongolian People&#x27;s Party (MPP) is a social democratic political party in Mongolia. It was founded as a communist party in 1920 by Mongolian revolutionaries and is the oldest political party in Mongolia.

The party played an important role in the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, which was inspired by the Bolsheviks&#x27; October Revolution. The revolutionaries&#x27; victory resulted in the establishment of the socialist Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic and the party becoming the sole ruling party of the country. The party changed its name to the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) and joined the Communist International in 1924.

As the MPRP, the party was organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the party was the Party Congress, convened every fifth year. When the Party Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body, but since they met normally only once a year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party&#x27;s leader has been titled General Secretary, Chairman, Secretary, and First Secretary. The party previously followed Marxism-Leninism, a synthesis of the ideas of Karl Marx and Lenin introduced by Joseph Stalin in 1929, under which the industries of Mongolia were nationalized and a planned economy was implemented.

Following the Mongolian Revolution of 1990, other political parties in Mongolia were legalised and the country transitioned into a multi-party democracy. The party subsequently abandoned Marxism–Leninism in favour of democratic socialism. In 2010, party members voted to adopt social democracy as the party&#x27;s ideology and restore the party&#x27;s original name, dropping the word &quot;revolutionary&quot;. This caused a faction to split away and form a new party to retain the long-standing name; the two parties reunited in 2021.

The party remained as Mongolia&#x27;s governing party after the 1990 revolution, until it was defeated in the 1996 election. From 2004 to 2008, it was a part of a coalition government with the Democratic Party and Motherland Party. From 2008 to 2012, the party participated in another coalition with the Democratic Party, although it had a majority in the Mongolian legislature. It became the main opposition party after the 2012 election. The party returned to power following the 2016 election and retained its majority in the 2020 and 2024 elections.

==History==
===Background===
In 1911, Outer Mongolia declared its independence from the Qing dynasty after over two centuries of Qing rule. However, the independence of the Bogd Khanate did not last since it was not recognized by its two neighbors (Russia and China) and was considered an autonomous region under Chinese sovereignty or suzerainty. In 1919, Mongolia was invaded by the Chinese Beiyang government and by White Russian forces in 1921.

===1921 revolution===

During the occupation two groups, known as the Consular Hill (&quot;Konsulyn denj&quot;) and East Khuree (&quot;Züün khüree&quot;), formed as resistance movements. On 25 June 1920, the groups united as the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party and decided to send seven representatives to the Soviet Union, who met with Soviet representatives in Irkutsk in August. On 1 March 1921, the party formed in Kyakhta (claiming to be Mongolia&#x27;s first political party) and formed a provisional government.

On 18 March, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army under Damdin Sükhbaatar defeated Chinese forces and took Kyakhta. In May, the White Russian Baron Ungern brought his forces north from Ikh Khuree and were defeated by joint Mongolian People&#x27;s Army and Red Army forces. On 25 June 1921, the Mongolian People’s Party issued a statement to all Mongolians about its decision to liberate the capital by force. The forces entered the capital on 6 July and declared independence on 11 July. Following advice from the Communist International, the party renamed itself the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party in 1924.

===Armed uprising and purges===

In 1928, Mongolian politics turned sharply left and began to adhere to communist ideology. Livestock herds were forcibly collectivized, private trade and transport forbidden and monasteries and the nobility were attacked. With state-run trade and transport unable to function, Mongolia&#x27;s economy broke down—over seven million head of livestock dead, leading to widespread unrest in 1932. The uprising was quelled in October after the involvement of Mongolian and Soviet armies, tanks and planes.

The first wave of purges began with the 1933 Lkhümbe affair, a manufactured conspiracy linking party secretary Jambyn Lkhümbe with Japanese spy networks. Over 1,500 people were purged, many of whom were executed. Victims included Prime Minister Peljidiin Genden, who was enthusiastic about the liberalisation of the economy. In 1936, Genden was removed from power and executed in the Soviet Union. Khorloogiin Choibalsan, a staunch ally of Joseph Stalin, gained power.

Between 1937 and 1939, a second wave of purges began, with 25,437 people officially arrested and 20,099 executed. The actual number of victims has been estimated at over 35,000 to 100,000. Over 18,000 were lamas, resulting in the virtual destruction of the Buddhist clergy. Between 1940 and 1955, those who were complicit in the earlier purges were themselves purged.

Under Choibalsan&#x27;s rule, improvements in Mongolia&#x27;s infrastructure, roads and communications were made with Soviet assistance and steps were taken to improve the country&#x27;s literacy rate. The 11th party congress was held in December 1947, approving Mongolia&#x27;s first five-year plan to intensify development of the economy, industry, animal husbandry and agriculture in stages.

In 1952, Khorloogiin Choibalsan died and Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal gained power. Tsedenbal purged his political rivals: Dashiin Damba in 1958–1959, Daramyn Tömör-Ochir in 1962, Luvsantserengiin Tsend in 1963 and the Lookhuuz-Nyambuu-Surmaajav anti-party group in December 1964. His foreign policy was marked by efforts to bring Mongolia into closer cooperation with the Soviet Union and attempts to incorporate the country into the Soviet Union. Tsedenbal&#x27;s attempts to make Mongolia the 16th Republic of the Soviet Union met strong opposition from other politicians and he was accused of treachery. During the Sino-Soviet split, Tsedenbal sided with the Soviet Union, incurring Chinese wrath. He is remembered for maintaining a path of moderate socialism during the Cold War.

===1990 Democratic Revolution===

In August 1984, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal was forced into retirement in a Soviet-sponsored move, allegedly due to age and mental state. Jambyn Batmönkh took power that month as the party and national leader.

The first open pro-democracy demonstration took place in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar on 10 December 1989. Over the next few months, the demonstration organizers founded Mongoliin Ardchilsan Kholboo (the Mongolian Democratic Union) and continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger, teachers&#x27; and workers&#x27; strikes in the capital and the countryside calling for democracy, receiving increased support from Mongolians nationwide.

On 7 March 1990 in Sükhbaatar Square, the Mongolian Democratic Union launched a hunger strike urging the communists to resign. The party&#x27;s politburo, the governmental authority, eventually yielded to pressure and began negotiating with the pro-democracy leaders. Jambyn Batmönkh, chairman of the party&#x27;s politburo, decided to dissolve it and resign on 9 March 1990. This paved the way for Mongolia&#x27;s first multi-party elections.

Behind the scenes, the party considered cracking down on the protesters and formulated a decree to be signed by party leader Batmönkh. Batmönkh opposed it, maintaining his policy of never using force (). According to those present, Batmönkh said &quot;I will never sign this. We few Mongols have not yet come to the point that we will make each other&#x27;s noses bleed&quot;, struck the table and left the room.

In the 1990 elections, parties contended for 430 seats in the Great Khural, but opposition parties were unable to nominate enough candidates. The Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party won 357 seats in the Great Khural and 31 of 53 seats in the Small Khural (which was later abolished). The new MPRP government under Dashiin Byambasüren shared power with the democrats, implementing constitutional and economic reforms and adopting a new constitution in 1992. With the collapse of the Soviet Union (which had provided significant economic aid to Mongolia until 1990), the country experienced severe economic problems. In the 1993 Mongolian presidential elections, the MPRP was defeated for the first time in its history—Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, the candidate backed by the democratic parties, received two-thirds of the vote.

The Democratic Union Coalition, co-led by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj as chairman of the Democratic Party, won the 1996 parliamentary elections for the first time. In 2000, 2004 and 2008, the MPRP won the legislative elections and was the ruling party. It formed two coalition governments with the Democratic Party, from 2004 to 2008 and 2008 to 2012. In 2003, the MPRP joined the Socialist International.

The 2008 parliamentary elections were especially controversial, with the MPRP accused of vote-rigging. Protests against the results turned violent on 1 July and a riot broke out at MPRP headquarters which was half-heartedly addressed by authorities—the party headquarters was destroyed by fire. After the riots, a five-day state of emergency was declared by President Nambaryn Enkhbayar for the first time in Mongolia&#x27;s history. Five civilians died during the emergency: four were shot and the fifth allegedly died from carbon-monoxide poisoning. The Mongolian Minister of Justice estimated that 220 civilians and 108 service members were injured. With the situation tense, the MPRP decided to admit the Democratic Party into the government and formed a coalition. The party demolished its headquarters and built its Independence Palace () with government subsidies and donations from party members; the building became fully operational on 26 November 2011.

In the 2009 Mongolian presidential election, Democratic Party candidate Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj defeated MPRP candidate and incumbent president Nambaryn Enkhbayar. In January 2012, the Democratic Party decided to leave the coalition government before the June parliamentary elections. In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party defeated the MPP; the MPP became the opposition, with 26 seats in parliament. In the 2012 local elections in Ulaanbaatar, the provinces and districts, the MPP was defeated for the first time in Mongolia&#x27;s history. In the 2013 Mongolian presidential election, the Democratic Party candidate and incumbent president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj again defeated the MPP candidate.

The MPP returned to power in 2016, winning an 85-percent majority of parliamentary seats. Prime Minister Chimed Saikhanbileg and parliament chairman Zandaakhuu Enkhbold were defeated, with the MPP&#x27;s Jargaltulga Erdenebat elected to succeed Saikhanbileg.

===Name restoration===

The restoration of the party name to the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party had been at the core of discussions among party members and at party congresses since 1990. In 2010, it was extensively deliberated at all party levels, resulting on 81.3 percent of the membership supporting the restoration of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party name and 10.7 percent of the membership wanting to deliberate the matter during the 26th party congress. The decision to restore the party&#x27;s original name was approved by 99.3 percent of the delegates to the 26th party congress. At the congress, the party described its political ideology as shifting from democratic socialism to social democracy.

After the MPRP restored its original name, former Mongolian president and MPRP chairman Nambaryn Enkhbayar founded a new political party in 2010. Enkhbayar received permission to use the name Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party for his new party from the Supreme Court of Mongolia on 24 June 2011.

=== Victories in the 2020s ===
The MPP won a landslide victory in the 2020 parliamentary election. The party&#x27;s election platform had six chapters and addresses population income, economic policy, governance, green development policy, Ulaanbaatar city development, and regional development policy. The election result marked the first time a single party has retained an absolute majority in consecutive elections. Previously the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party and the Democratic Party had taken turns wielding a majority in the State Great Khural or were compelled to form coalition governments.

In June 2021, former prime minister Ukhnaa Khurelsukh of the MPP became the country&#x27;s sixth democratically elected president after winning the presidential election, further consolidating the party&#x27;s power in the Mongolian government.

The party retained its absolute majority (although much reduced) in the 2024 parliamentary election.

<text>The Hallstatt culture was the predominant Western and Central European archaeological culture of the Late Bronze Age (Hallstatt A, Hallstatt B) from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and Early Iron Age Europe (Hallstatt C, Hallstatt D) from the 8th to 6th centuries BC, developing out of the Urnfield culture of the 12th century BC (Late Bronze Age) and followed in much of its area by the La Tène culture. It is commonly associated with Proto-Celtic speaking populations.

It is named for its type site, Hallstatt, a lakeside village in the Austrian Salzkammergut southeast of Salzburg, where there was a rich salt mine, and some 1,300 burials are known, many with fine artifacts. Material from Hallstatt has been classified into four periods, designated &quot;Hallstatt A&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. Hallstatt A and B are regarded as Late Bronze Age and the terms used for wider areas, such as &quot;Hallstatt culture&quot;, or &quot;period&quot;, &quot;style&quot; and so on, relate to the Iron Age Hallstatt C and D.

By the 6th century BC, it had expanded to include wide territories, falling into two zones, east and west, between them covering much of western and central Europe down to the Alps, and extending into northern Italy. Parts of Britain and Iberia are included in the ultimate expansion of the culture.

The culture was based on farming, but metal-working was considerably advanced, and by the end of the period long-range trade within the area and with Mediterranean cultures was economically significant. Social distinctions became increasingly important, with emerging elite classes of chieftains and warriors, and perhaps those with other skills. Society is thought to have been organized on a tribal basis, though very little is known about this. Settlement size was generally small, although a few of the largest settlements, like Heuneburg in the south of Germany, were towns rather than villages by modern standards. However, at the end of the period these seem to have been overthrown or abandoned.

== Chronology ==
According to Paul Reinecke&#x27;s time-scheme from 1902, the end of the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age were divided into four periods:

Bronze Age Urnfield culture:

* HaA (1200–1050 BC)
* HaB (1050-800 BC)

Early Iron Age Hallstatt culture:

* HaC (800-620 BC)
* HaD (620-450 BC)
Paul Reinecke based his chronological divisions on finds from the south of Germany.

Already by 1881 Otto Tischler had made analogies to the Iron Age in the Northern Alps based on finds of brooches from graves in the south of Germany.

=== Absolute dating ===
It has proven difficult to use radiocarbon dating for the Early Iron Age due to the so-called &quot;Hallstatt-Plateau&quot;, a phenomenon where radiocarbon dates cannot be distinguished between 750 and 400 BC. There are workarounds however, such as the wiggle matching technique. Therefore, dating in this time-period has been based mainly on Dendrochronology and relative dating.

For the beginning of HaC wood pieces from the Cart Grave of Wehringen (Landkreis Augsburg) deliver a solid dating in 778 ± 5 BC (Grave Barrow 8).

Despite missing an older Dendro-date for HaC, the convention remains that the Hallstatt period begins together with the arrival of the iron ore processing technology around 800 BC.

=== Relative dating ===
HaC is dated according to the presence of Mindelheim-type swords, binocular brooches, harp brooches, and arched brooches.

Based on the quickly changing fashions of brooches, it was possible to divide HaD into three stages (D1-D3). In HaD1 snake brooches are predominant, while in HaD2 drum brooches appear more often, and in HaD3 the double-drum and embellished foot brooches.

The transition to the La Tène period is often connected with the emergence of the first animal-shaped brooches, with Certosa-type and with Marzabotto-type brooches.

==Hallstatt type site==
The community at Hallstatt was untypical of the wider, mainly agricultural, culture, as its booming economy exploited the salt mines in the area. These had been worked from time to time since the Neolithic period, and in this period were extensively mined with a peak from the 8th to 5th centuries BC. The style and decoration of the grave goods found in the cemetery are very distinctive, and artifacts made in this style are widespread in Europe. In the mine workings themselves, the salt has preserved many organic materials such as textiles, wood and leather, and many abandoned artifacts such as shoes, pieces of cloth, and tools including miner&#x27;s backpacks, have survived in good condition.

In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer (1795–1874) discovered a large prehistoric cemetery near Hallstatt, Austria (), which he excavated during the second half of the 19th century. Eventually the excavation would yield 1,045 burials, although no settlement has yet been found. This may be covered by the later village, which has long occupied the whole narrow strip between the steep hillsides and the lake. Some 1,300 burials have been found, including around 2,000 individuals, with women and children but few infants. Nor is there a &quot;princely&quot; burial, as often found near large settlements. Instead, there are a large number of burials varying considerably in the number and richness of the grave goods, but with a high proportion containing goods suggesting a life well above subsistence level. It is now thought that at least most of these were not miners themselves, but from a richer class controlling the mines. 

Finds at Hallstatt extend from about 1200 BC until around 500 BC, and are divided by archaeologists into four phases:

Hallstatt A–B (1200–800 BC) are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture. In this period, people were cremated and buried in simple graves. In phase B, tumulus (barrow or kurgan) burial becomes common, and cremation predominates. The &quot;Hallstatt period&quot; proper is restricted to HaC and HaD (800–450 BC), corresponding to the early European Iron Age. Hallstatt lies in the area where the western and eastern zones of the Hallstatt culture meet, which is reflected in the finds from there. 
Hallstatt D is succeeded by the La Tène culture.

Hallstatt C is characterized by the first appearance of iron swords mixed amongst the bronze ones. Inhumation and cremation co-occur. For the final phase, Hallstatt D, daggers, almost to the exclusion of swords, are found in western zone graves ranging from –500 BC. There are also differences in the pottery and brooches. Burials were mostly inhumations. Halstatt D has been further divided into the sub-phases D1–D3, relating only to the western zone, and mainly based on the form of brooches.

Major activity at the site appears to have finished about 500 BC, for reasons that are unclear. Many Hallstatt graves were robbed, probably at this time. There was widespread disruption throughout the western Hallstatt zone, and the salt workings had by then become very deep. By then the focus of salt mining had shifted to the nearby Hallein Salt Mine, with graves at Dürrnberg nearby where there are significant finds from the late Hallstatt and early La Tène periods, until the mid-4th century BC, when a major landslide destroyed the mineshafts and ended mining activity.

Much of the material from early excavations was dispersed, and is now found in many collections, especially German and Austrian museums, but the Hallstatt Museum in the town has the largest collection.

==Culture and trade==


=== Languages ===
It is probable that some if not all of the diffusion of Hallstatt culture took place in a Celtic-speaking context. In northern Italy the Golasecca culture developed with continuity from the Canegrate culture. Canegrate represented a completely new cultural dynamic to the area expressed in pottery and bronzework, making it a typical western example of the western Hallstatt culture.

The Lepontic Celtic language inscriptions of the area show the language of the Golasecca culture was clearly Celtic, making it probable that the 13th-century BC precursor language of at least the western Hallstatt was also Celtic or a precursor to it. Lepontic inscriptions have also been found in Umbria, in the area which saw the emergence of the Terni culture, which had strong similarities with the Celtic cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. The Umbrian necropolis of Terni, which dates back to the 10th century BC, was virtually identical in every aspect to the Celtic necropolis of the Golasecca culture.

Older assumptions of the early 20th century of Illyrians having been the bearers of especially the Eastern Hallstatt culture are indefensible and archeologically unsubstantiated.

=== Trade ===
Trade with Greece is attested by finds of Attic black-figure pottery in the elite graves of the late Hallstatt period. It was probably imported via Massilia (Marseilles). Other imported luxuries include amber, ivory (as found at the Grafenbühl Tomb) and probably wine. Red kermes dye was imported from the south as well; it was found at Hochdorf. Notable individual imports include the Greek Vix krater (the largest known metal vessel from Western classical antiquity), the Etruscan lebes from Sainte-Colombe-sur-Seine, the Greek hydria from Grächwil, the Greek cauldron from Hochdorf and the Greek or Etruscan cauldron from Lavau.

=== Settlements ===

The largest settlements were mostly fortified, situated on hilltops, and frequently included the workshops of bronze, silver and gold smiths. Major settlements are known as &#x27;princely seats&#x27; (or &quot;Fürstensitze&quot; in German), and are characterized by elite residences, rich burials, monumental buildings and fortifications. Some of these central sites are described as urban or proto-urban, and as &quot;the first cities north of the Alps&quot;. Typical sites of this type are the Heuneburg on the upper Danube surrounded by nine very large grave tumuli, and Mont Lassois in eastern France near Châtillon-sur-Seine with, at its foot, the very rich grave at Vix. The Heuneburg is thought to correspond to the Celtic city of &#x27;Pyrene&#x27; mentioned by Herodotus in 450 BC.

Other important sites include the Glauberg, Hohenasperg and Ipf in Germany, the Burgstallkogel in Austria and Molpír in Slovakia. However, most settlements were much smaller villages. The large monumental site of Alte Burg may have had a religious or ceremonial function, and possibly served as a location for games and competitions.

At the end of the Hallstatt period many major centres were abandoned and there was a return to a more decentralized settlement pattern. Urban centres later re-emerged across temperate Europe in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC during the La Tène period.

=== Burial rites ===

The burials at Hallstatt itself show a movement over the period from cremation to inhumation, with grave goods at all times (see above).

In the central Hallstatt regions toward the end of the period (Ha D), very rich graves of high-status individuals under large tumuli are found near the remains of fortified hilltop settlements. Tumuli graves had a chamber, rather large in some cases, lined with timber and with the body and grave goods set about the room. There are some chariot or wagon burials, including Býčí Skála and Brno-Holásky in the Czech Republic, Vix, Sainte-Colombe-sur-Seine and Lavau in France, Hochdorf, Hohmichele and Grafenbühl in Germany, and Mitterkirchen in Austria.

A model of a chariot made from lead has been found in Frög, Carinthia, and clay models of horses with riders are also found. Wooden &quot;funerary carts&quot;, presumably used as hearses and then buried, are sometimes found in the grandest graves. Pottery and bronze vessels, weapons, elaborate jewellery made of bronze and gold, as well as a few stone stelae (especially the famous Warrior of Hirschlanden) are found at such burials. The daggers that largely replaced swords in chief&#x27;s graves in the west were probably not serious weapons, but badges of rank, and used at the table.
=== Social structure ===

The material culture of Western Hallstatt culture was apparently sufficient to provide a stable social and economic equilibrium. The founding of Marseille and the penetration by Greek and Etruscan culture after , resulted in long-range trade relationships up the Rhone valley which triggered social and cultural transformations in the Hallstatt settlements north of the Alps. Powerful local chiefdoms emerged which controlled the redistribution of luxury goods from the Mediterranean world that is also characteristic of the La Tène culture.

The apparently largely peaceful and prosperous life of Hallstatt D culture was disrupted, perhaps even collapsed, right at the end of the period. There has been much speculation as to the causes of this, which remain uncertain. Large settlements such as Heuneburg and the Burgstallkogel were destroyed or abandoned, rich tumulus burials ended, and old ones were looted. There was probably a significant movement of population westwards, and the succeeding La Tène culture developed new centres to the west and north, their growth perhaps overlapping with the final years of the Hallstatt culture.

Occasional iron artefacts had been appearing in central and western Europe for some centuries before 800 BC (an iron knife or sickle from Ganovce in Slovakia, dating to the 18th century BC, is possibly the earliest evidence of smelted iron in Central Europe). By the later Urnfield (Hallstatt B) phase, some swords were already being made and embellished in iron in eastern Central Europe, and occasionally much further west.

Initially iron was rather exotic and expensive, and sometimes used as a prestige material for jewellery. Iron swords became more common after , and steel was also produced from 800 BC as part of the production of swords. The production of high-carbon steel is attested in Britain after .

The remarkable uniformity of spoked-wheel wagons from across the Hallstatt region indicates a certain standardisation of production methods, which included techniques such as lathe-turning. Iron tyres were developed and refined in this period, leading to the invention of shrunk-on tyres in the La Tène period. The potter&#x27;s wheel also appeared in the Hallstatt period.

The extensive use of planking and massive squared beams indicates the use of long saw blades and possibly two-man sawing. The planks of the Hohmichele burial chamber (6th c. BC), which were over 6m long and 35 cm wide, appear to have been sawn by a large timber-yard saw. The construction of monumental buildings such as the Vix palace further demonstrates a &quot;mastery of geometry and carpentry capable of freeing up vast interior spaces.&quot;

Analyses of building remains in Silesia have found evidence for the use of a standard unit of length (equivalent to 0.785 m). Remarkably, this is almost identical to the length of a measuring stick found at Borum Eshøj in Denmark (0.7855 m) dating from the Bronze Age (c. 1350 BC). Pythagorean triangles were likely used in building construction to create right angles, and some buildings had ground plans with dimensions corresponding to Pythagorean rectangles.

==Art==

At least the later periods of Hallstatt art from the western zone are generally agreed to form the early period of Celtic art. Decoration is mostly geometric and linear, and best seen on fine metalwork finds from graves (see above). Styles differ, especially between the west and east, with more human figures and some narrative elements in the latter. Animals, with waterfowl a particular favourite, are often included as part of other objects, more often than humans, and in the west there is almost no narrative content such as scenes of combat depicted. These characteristics were continued into the succeeding La Tène style.

Imported luxury art is sometimes found in rich elite graves in the later phases, and certainly had some influence on local styles. The most spectacular objects, such as the Strettweg Cult Wagon, the Warrior of Hirschlanden and the bronze couch supported by &quot;unicyclists&quot; from the Hochdorf Chieftain&#x27;s Grave are one of a kind in finds from the Hallstatt period, though they can be related to objects from other periods.

More common objects include weapons, in Ha D often with hilts terminating in curving forks (&quot;antenna hilts&quot;). Jewellery in metal includes fibulae, often with a row of disks hanging down on chains, armlets and some torcs. This is mostly in bronze, but &quot;princely&quot; burials include items in gold.

The origin of the narrative scenes of the eastern zone, from Hallstatt C onwards, is generally traced to influence from the Situla art of northern Italy and the northern Adriatic, where these bronze buckets began to be decorated in bands with figures in provincial Etruscan centres influenced by Etruscan and Greek art. The fashion for decorated situlae spread north across neighbouring cultures including the eastern Hallstatt zone, beginning around 600 BC and surviving until about 400 BC; the Vače situla is a Slovenian example from near the final period. The style is also found on bronze belt plates, and some of the vocabulary of motifs spread to influence the emerging La Tène style.

According to Ruth and Vincent Megaw, &quot;Situla art depicts life as seen from a masculine viewpoint, in which women are servants or sex objects; most of the scenes which include humans are of the feasts in which the situlae themselves figure, of the hunt or of war&quot;. Similar scenes are found on other vessel shapes, as well as bronze belt-plaques. The processions of animals, typical of earlier examples, or humans derive from the Near East and Mediterranean, and Nancy Sandars finds the style shows &quot;a &quot;gaucherie&quot; that betrays the artist working in a way that is uncongenial, too much at variance with the temper of the craftsmen and the craft&quot;. Compared to earlier styles that arose organically in Europe &quot;situla art is weak and sometimes quaint&quot;, and &quot;in essence not of Europe&quot;.

Except for the Italian Benvenuti Situla, men are hairless, with &quot;funny hats, dumpy bodies and big heads&quot;, though often shown looking cheerful in an engaging way. The Benevenuti Situla is also unusual in that it seems to show a specific story.

The Strettweg cult wagon from Austria (c. 600 BC) has been interpreted as representing a deer goddess or &#x27;Great Nature Goddess&#x27; similar to Artemis.

Hallstatt culture musical instruments included harps, lyres, zithers, woodwinds, panpipes, horns, drums and rattles.

==Inscriptions==
A small number of inscriptions have been recovered from Hallstatt culture sites. Markings or symbols inscribed on iron tools from Austria dating from the early Iron Age (Ha C, 800-650 BC) show continuity with symbols from the Bronze Age Urnfield culture, and are thought to be related to mining and the metal trade. Inscriptions engraved on situlas or cauldrons from the Hallstatt cemetery in Austria, dating from c. 800-500 BC, have been interpreted as numerals, letters and words, possibly related to Etruscan or Old Italic scripts. Weights from Bavaria dating from the 7th to early 6th century BC bear signs possibly resembling Greek or Etruscan letters. A single-word inscription (possibly a name) on a locally produced ceramic sherd from Montmorot in eastern France, dating from the late 7th to mid-6th century BC, has been identified as either Gaulish or Lepontic, written in either a &#x27;proto-Lepontic&#x27; or Etruscan alphabet. A fragment of an inscription painted on local pottery has also been recovered from the late Hallstatt site of Bragny-sur-Saône in eastern France, dating from the 5th century BC. A letter inscribed on a gold cup was deposited in a princely tomb at Apremont in eastern France, dating from c. 500 BC.

Another fragmentary inscription on pottery was found in a princely burial near Bergères-les-Vertus in north-eastern France, dating from late 5th century BC (at the beginning of La Tène A). The inscription has been identified as the Celtic word for &quot;king&quot;, written in the Lepontic alphabet. According to Olivier (2010), &quot;this graffito represents one of the earliest attested occurrences of the word &quot;rîx&quot; which designates the &quot;king&quot; in the Celtic languages. ... It would also seem to represent the first co-occurrence in the Celtic world of a funerary archaeological context and a contemporaneous linguistic qualification as ‘royal’.” According to Verger (1998) the 7th-6th century BC inscription from Montmorot &quot;is at the beginning of a still limited series of documents attesting to the use of alphabetic signs and the use of writing in Eastern Gaul during the entire period characterised by the appearance, development and end of the Hallstattian &#x27;princely phenomenon&#x27;. ... The first transmission of the alphabet north of the Alps, at the end of the 7th or in the first half of the 6th century, seems to be only the beginning of a process that was regularly renewed until the second half of the fifth century.&quot;

==Calendar==

The monumental burial mounds at Glauberg and Magdalenenberg in Germany featured structures aligned with the point of the major lunar standstill, which occurs every 18.6 years. At Glauberg this took the form of a &#x27;processional avenue&#x27; lined by large ditches, whilst at Magdalenenberg the alignment was marked with a large timber palisade. The knowledge required to create these alignments would have required long-term observation of the skies, possibly over several generations. At Glauberg other ditches and postholes associated with the mound may have been used to observe astronomical phenomena such as the solstices, with the whole ensemble functioning as a calendar. According to the archaeologist Allard Mees, the numerous burials within the Magdalenenberg mound were positioned to mirror the constellations as they appeared at the time of the summer solstice in 618 BC. Mees argues that the Magdalenenberg represented a lunar calendar and that knowledge of the 18.6 year lunar standstill cycle would have enabled the prediction of lunar eclipses. According to Mees many other burial mounds in this period were also aligned with lunar phenomena. An analysis of Hallstatt period burials by Müller-Scheeßel (2005) similarly suggested that they were oriented towards specific constellations. According to Gaspani (1998) the diagonals of the rectangular Hochdorf burial chamber were also aligned with the major lunar standstill.

Further evidence for knowledge of lunar eclipse cycles in this period comes from Fiskerton in England, where an analysis of a wooden causeway used to make ritual depositions into the Witham river found that the causeway timbers were felled at intervals corresponding to Saros lunar eclipse cycles, indicating that the builders were able to predict these cycles in advance. According to the archaeologists who studied this site, similar evidence can be found at other locations in the British Isles and Central Europe dating from the Late Bronze Age through to the Late Iron Age, suggesting that knowledge of lunar eclipse cycles may have been widespread in this period. Knowledge of Saros cycles may also be numerically encoded on the Late Bronze Age Berlin Gold Hat.

The mountain peaks around Hallstatt may have also functioned as a large sundial and visual calendar. A similar system is thought to have existed in the Vosges mountains during the Iron Age (the Belchen system) which incorporated dates associated with major Celtic festivals such as Beltane.

Kruta (2010) interprets a large decorated brooch from Hallstatt, dating from the 6th century BC, as representing a &#x27;symbolic summary of the course of the year&#x27;. Depictions on the brooch of waterfowl (representing night and winter) and horses (representing day and summer) are placed above a solar boat (representing the sun&#x27;s journey from one winter solstice to the next), whilst twelve circular pendants represent the lunar months.

According to Garrett Olmsted (2001) the Celtic Coligny calendar, dating from the 1st-2nd centuries AD, has origins dating back to the Hallstatt period or Late Bronze Age, indicating that calendrical knowledge was transmitted through a long oral tradition.

==Geography==
Two culturally distinct areas, an eastern and a western zone are generally recognised. There are distinctions in burial rites, the types of grave goods, and in artistic style. In the western zone, members of the elite were buried with sword (HaC) or dagger (HaD), in the eastern zone with an axe. The western zone has chariot burials. In the eastern zone, warriors are frequently buried with helmet and a plate armour breastplate. Artistic subjects with a narrative component are only found in the east, in both pottery and metalwork. In the east the settlements and cemeteries can be larger than in the west.

The approximate division line between the two subcultures runs from north to south through central Bohemia and Lower Austria at about 14 to 15 degrees eastern longitude, and then traces the eastern and southern rim of the Alps to Eastern and Southern Tyrol.

===Western Hallstatt zone===
Taken at its most generous extent, the western Hallstatt zone includes:
*northeastern France: Burgundy, Franche-Comté, Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, Alsace
*northern Switzerland: Swiss plateau
*Southern Germany: much of Swabia and Bavaria
*western Czech Republic: Bohemia
*western Austria: Vorarlberg, Tyrol, Salzkammergut

West Hallstatt influence is also later perceptible in the rest of France, in England and Ireland, in northern Italy and in central, northern and western Iberia.

While Hallstatt is regarded as the dominant settlement of the western zone, a settlement at the Burgstallkogel in the central Sulm valley (southern Styria, west of Leibnitz, Austria) was a major centre during the Hallstatt C period. Parts of the huge necropolis (which originally consisted of more than 1,100 tumuli) surrounding this settlement can be seen today near Gleinstätten, and the chieftain&#x27;s mounds were on the other side of the hill, near Kleinklein. The finds are mostly in the Landesmuseum Joanneum at Graz, which also holds the Strettweg Cult Wagon.

===Eastern Hallstatt zone===

The eastern Hallstatt zone includes:
*eastern Austria: Lower Austria, Upper Styria
*eastern Czech Republic: Moravia
*southwestern Slovakia: Danubian Lowland
*western Hungary: Little Hungarian Plain
*eastern Slovenia: Hallstatt Archaeological Site in Vače (at the border between Lower Styria and Lower Carniola regions), Novo Mesto 
*western Slovenia: Svetolucijska Hallstatt culture Most na Soči, Notranjsko kraška Slovene Littoral
*northern Croatia: Hrvatsko Zagorje, Istria
*northern and central Serbia
*parts of southwestern Poland
*northern and western Bulgaria

Trade, cultural diffusion, and some population movements spread the Hallstatt cultural complex (western form) into Britain, and Ireland.


==Genetics==
Damgaard et al. (2018) analyzed the remains of a male and female buried at a Hallstatt cemetery near Litoměřice, Czech Republic between ca. 600 BC and 400 BC. The male carried paternal haplogroup R1b and the maternal haplogroup H6a1a. The female was a carrier of the maternal haplogroup HV0. Damgaard further examined the remains of 5 individuals ascribed to either Hallstatt C or the early La Tène culture. The one male carried Y-haplogroup G2a. The five females carried mt-haplogroups K1a2a, J1c2o, H7d, U5a1a1 and J1c-16261. The examined individuals of the Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture displayed genetic continuity with the earlier Bell Beaker culture, and carried about 50% steppe-related ancestry.

The next study, Fischer et al. (2022), examined 49 genomes from 27 sites in Bronze Age and Iron Age France. The study found of strong genetic continuity between the two periods, particularly in southern France. The samples from northern and southern France were highly homogenous. The northern French samples were distinguished from the southern ones by elevated levels of steppe-related ancestry. R1b was by far the most dominant paternal lineage, while H was the most common maternal lineage. They displayed links to contemporary samples from Great Britain and Sweden. Southern samples displaying links to Celtiberians. The Iron Age samples resembled those of modern-day populations of France, Great Britain and Spain. The evidence suggested that the Celts of the Hallstatt culture largely evolved from local Bronze Age populations.

<text>The Islamic Iran Participation Front (; &quot;Jebheye Mosharekate Iran-e Eslaami&quot;) was a reformist political party in Iran. It was sometimes described as the most dominant member within the 2nd of Khordad Front.

The party took 189 of the 290 seats (65%) in the Sixth Majlis.

In the aftermath of the Green Movement protests, its license was revoked and the party was subsequently barred from contesting elections.

==History and profile==
Founded in late 1998, the main motto of the IIPF is &quot;Iran for all Iranians&quot; (). While still backing Islam, the state religion of Iran, the party is among the evangelizers of democracy in Iran. Some members of the front however belong to different factions and ideologies, as described by Saeed Hajjarian it is &quot;the party of between the two Abbas&quot; (, referring to the gap between right-winger Abbas Duzduzani and left-winger Abbas Abdi).

It was led by former Secretary-General of the party, Mohammad Reza Khatami (the brother of Mohammad Khatami, the fifth President of Iran) before the election of Mohsen Mirdamadi as new Secretary-General in 9th congress.

In 2004, Mohammad Reza Khatami, along with other prominent members such as Elaheh Koulaei, Mohsen Mirdamadi, and Ali Shakouri-Rad were barred from standing in the parliament elections by the Council of Guardians.

In spring of 2005, this party supported Mostafa Moin in the presidential election together with its unofficial daily &quot;Eqbal&quot; which was disestablished in July 2005.

==Members==
The decision center of the party is the Central Council, which has thirty members. Some of the members include:
* Mohammad Reza Khatami
* Saeed Hajjarian
* Elaheh Koulaei
* Mostafa Tajzadeh
* Mohsen Mirdamadi
* Abdollah Ramezanzadeh
* Safdar Hosseini
* Ali Shakouri-Rad
* Jalal Jalalizadeh
* Ahmad Shirzad
* Hadi Ghabel
* Davoud Soleymani
* Saeed Shirkavand

== Ban ==

Following 2009 post-poll protests, the government suspended the party along with the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Organization in April 2010. A few weeks later in March, Iranian Judiciary banned the party and closed down its office when it had scheduled to hold its annual meeting. The party called the action &quot;an illegal act&quot;. In October, the party declared that Branch 27 of Tehran General Court overturned the decision of the Ministry of Interior&#x27;s Article 10 Commission, responsible for licensing political parties in Iran.
On 27 September 2010, prosecutor-general told press that the party is dissolved and not allowed to have any activities. The party announced it had received no notification of any such court verdict and thus could not be enforced, calling for a chance to appeal. In November 2011, the interior ministry declared that the party is unable to run for parliament seats in the 2012 elections because its license is revoked.

<doc id="427484" wikidata="Q887527" url="?curid=427484" title="Board of Deputies of British Jews">
<text>The Board of Deputies of British Jews, commonly referred to as the Board of Deputies, is the largest and second oldest Jewish communal organisation in the United Kingdom, after the Initiation Society which was founded in 1745. Established in 1760 by a group of Sephardic Jews, the board presents itself as a forum for the views of most organisations within the British Jewish community, liaising with the British government on that basis. Notably, while Lord Rothschild was President of the Board of Deputies, the Balfour Declaration was addressed to him and eventually led to the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. It is affiliated to the World Jewish Congress and the European Jewish Congress. The current president is Phil Rosenberg.

==History==
The Board of Deputies of British Jews was established in London in 1760. Seven deputies were appointed by the elders of the Sephardi congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews to form a standing committee (Portuguese: &quot;deputados&quot;) founded to pay homage to George III on his accession to the throne. The Ashkenazi Jewish congregation then followed suit, establishing a public affairs committee to address urgent political matters and safeguard the interests of British Jews in the British Isles and the colonies. The two bodies began to meet and united in the 1810s. The joint organization was named the London Committee of Deputies of British Jews.

In the mid-19th century, the organisation was headed by Sir Moses Montefiore, the Sephardi lay leader of British Jewry, and Nathan Adler, the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi. The current name was adopted in 1913. In the course of its history, some of the major disputes were between Sephardi and Ashkenazi leaders and between religious and lay leaders.

The Board became more prominent in British society in the early twentieth century due to its support of refugees, notably leading an ultimately failed campaign against the Aliens Act 1905. However, by the 1930s, the Board&#x27;s position had shifted to a more assimilationist position in order to improve the perception of Jews among the non-Jewish British population, including adopting a position of non-Zionism. In 1933, Neville Laski was elected as the Board&#x27;s President, and called for Jews to give &quot;overriding consideration of duty and loyalty&quot; to the United Kingdom. However, the stances of the Board once again had shifted in 1939 with the election as President of Selig Brodetsky, who was described by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency as the &quot;foremost Zionist in Great Britain&quot;. As of 2024 the Board has continued to hold a Zionist position.

==Members and organisation==

The board is led by Phil Rosenberg. The chief executive is Michael Wegier, the former chief executive of the UJIA. He succeeded Gillian Merron, who represented Labour as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln from 1997 to 2010. From 2009 to 2010, she was Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health at the Department of Health. In 2020, she left her position at the Board when she was appointed a life peer, representing the Labour Party in the House of Lords. Michael Wegier leads a team of professional staff including Director of Public Affairs, Daniel Sugarman (formerly a journalist at &quot;The Jewish Chronicle)&quot;.

Its membership comprises deputies elected by affiliated individual synagogues, confederations of synagogues, and other organisations within the Jewish community such as charities and youth groups. Most Haredi synagogues have chosen not to affiliate, although in 2021 the Board received its first Haredi deputy since the 1970s, from a synagogue in Stamford Hill. In 2012, it was noted that nearly two-thirds of the deputies were over 60 years of age. However, in the 21st century, the organisation has seen an influx of younger deputies, including two vice-presidents in their early thirties and Phil Rosenberg, who at the age of 38 was elected to succeed van der Zyl as president from 1 June 2024.

It serves as the principal reference point for government, the media and wider society. All matters tending to impact on the life of Jews in Britain fall within the Board&#x27;s remit, including an active interfaith programme. It is the British affiliate of the World Jewish Congress, the world-wide umbrella organisation of Jewish communities and is the UK member of the European Jewish Congress. Its offices are co-located with the United Jewish Israel Appeal in Kentish Town.

In January 2019, the Jewish Leadership Council reiterated its call for a &quot;unified communal structure&quot; with the Board of Deputies. A previous merger proposal was rejected in 2015 after deputies felt that they would be relegated to second-rate status. In response to the later call, Marie van der Zyl said that &quot;the representative body that speaks for the community must have the legitimacy and accountability that comes from being broad based, democratic and elected.&quot; Deputies have in the past noted that, while board honorary officers are accountable to deputies, who themselves are accountable to their constituencies, the Jewish Leadership Council had no such governance structure. However, in March 2020, van de Zyl called in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; for &quot;a more permanent unity&quot; between the organisations.

==Mission==
The issues which the board states it addresses are:

* Antisemitism and extremism
* Israel and the Middle East
* Education
* Religious freedoms and inequalities
* Interfaith and social action
* International advocacy

==Controversies==
In 2003, the Board, on its website, reproduced an extract from a US State Department report that suggested that the aid organisation Palestinian Relief and Development Fund (Interpal) was helping to fund terrorist organisations. Interpal threatened to sue for libel, whereupon the Board retracted and apologised for its comments.

In the same year the Jewish Leadership Council, which says it &quot;brings together the major British Jewish organisations to work for the good of the British Jewish community&quot;, was founded.

In 2005, after the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, compared a Jewish &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard, the Board, along with the Commission for Racial Equality, filed an ultimately unsuccessful complaint to the Standards Board for England, calling on Livingstone to apologise. Livingstone responded by stating &quot;there is no law against &#x27;unnecessary insensitivity&#x27; or even &#x27;offensiveness&#x27; to journalists harassing you as you try to go home&quot; and that he had a &quot;25-year running battle&quot; with the paper&#x27;s owners.

In 2014, at the height of the Israeli military operation in Gaza, the Board issued a joint statement with the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemning antisemitism and Islamophobia. The statement with its slogan &#x27;to export peace rather than import conflict&#x27; proved controversial among some on the conservative wing of the Jewish community but was supported by others on the progressive wing and by groups in inter faith circles. The principle of such a statement was approved by a majority of over 75% at a meeting of the Board on 21 September 2014. In December 2015, the new leadership of the Board distanced itself from the MCB over the latter&#x27;s alleged links to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.

In 2018, over five hundred British Jews signed a letter from Yachad saying that the Board had &quot;deeply misrepresented&quot; their views after the board criticised Hamas for &quot;repeated violent attempts at mass invasion&quot; but did not call for Israeli restraint or acknowledge that the IDF may have acted disproportionately in killing scores of Palestinians. Liberal Judaism said that &quot;the Board&#x27;s credibility as the voice of British Jewry depends wholly on its willingness to listen to, hear from and reflect the values of all sections of the community&quot;.

In July 2018, the Board suspended Roslyn Pine, deputy for Finchley United Synagogue, for six years, following comments she made which were described as Islamophobic, and for admitting to holding anti-Arab views.

Writing in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in November 2018 about antisemitism in the Labour Party, Marie van der Zyl said, &quot;Over the summer, we showed how we could keep this issue of antisemitism on the front pages day after day, week after week, exacting a severe political and reputational cost for continued failure.&quot; In 2019, following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s decision to resign as leader of the Labour Party, the Board asked candidates for the leadership to sign up to ten pledges in order to &quot;end the antisemitism crisis&quot;. The pledges included a resolution of outstanding disciplinary cases, lifetime membership bans for some individuals, an independent disciplinary process, full and unconditional adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism, and engagement with the mainstream Jewish community. Most of the candidates for leader or deputy leader signed up unconditionally.

In 2020, the Board clashed with the new Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, and some members of the community over the Board&#x27;s continued commitment to Palestinian statehood as part of a two-state solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict.

==Scotland==
After Scottish devolution in 1999, the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities was formed to give the Jewish Community of Scotland a single democratically accountable voice in dealings with the Scottish Parliament and Executive, other communities, and other statutory and official bodies. The intention when it was established was for it to stand in the same relationship to the Scottish Government as the Board of Deputies of British Jews does to the UK Government. Consequently, the council is autonomous in matters devolved by the Scotland Act, such as justice, health and welfare, and community relations, whilst the Board of Deputies speaks for all Britain&#x27;s Jews on reserved matters such as foreign affairs and equality legislation.

==List of presidents==

<doc id="427488" wikidata="Q1531070" url="?curid=427488" title="The Necks">
<text>The Necks are an Australian avant-garde jazz trio formed in 1987 by founding mainstays Chris Abrahams on piano and Hammond organ, Tony Buck on drums, percussion and electric guitar, and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar and double bass. They play long improvisational pieces of up to an hour in length that explore the development and demise of repeating musical figures characteristic of the New York School of long-form Minimal Music as practiced by La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich and Rhys Chatham; and the free improvisation jazz music of Cecil Taylor.

Their double LP studio album &quot;Unfold&quot; was named by Rolling Stone as &quot;one of the top 20 avant albums of 2017.&quot; In 2020, the Necks were listed at number 49 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time&quot; issue.

== History ==
The Necks were formed in 1987 in Sydney by Chris Abrahams on piano and Hammond organ, Tony Buck on drums, percussion and electric guitar, and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar and double bass. In 1983 Abrahams (ex-Laughing Clowns) on keyboards and Swanton on bass guitar were founders of the Benders, a jazz group, with Dale Barlow and Jason Morphett on saxophones, and Louis Burdett on drums; which disbanded in 1985.

Abrahams had formed the Sparklers in 1985, a dance pop band, with Bill Bilson on drums (ex-Sunnyboys), Gerard Corben on guitar (ex-Lime Spiders), Ernie Finckh on guitar, Melanie Oxley on lead vocals (ex-Sweet Nothing), and her older brother Peter Oxley on bass guitar (ex-Sunnyboys). Abrahams left in 1987 before that group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Persuasion&quot; (October 1988). Buck had been a member of a number of groups: Great White Noise (1983), Women and Children First, Tango Bravo and Pardon Me Boys; prior to forming the Necks. In 1986 Swanton had been a member of Dynamic Hepnotics.

According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, the Necks &quot;issued several albums of abstract, improvised, jazzy mood music.&quot; François Couture of AllMusic described how they &quot;usually start playing a very basic melodic and rhythmic figure, and then keep going at it for an hour, gradually introducing microscopic changes and variations. Some critics have compared them to Krautrock groups like Can and Faust. Others find similarities in the works of minimalist composers like LaMonte Young, Tony Conrad, even Philip Glass.&quot; The band has been described as &quot;offending (successfully) against tradition for the past quarter of a century, [doing so] mostly by occupying the spaces between accepted positions and obstinately refusing to obey genre rules&quot;.

The group issued their debut album, &quot;Sex&quot; on the Spiral Scratch label in 1989. It consists of a single track of the same name, which is just under an hour long. Couture noticed that &quot;The difference between &quot;Sex&quot; and the many other CDs they would record afterwards is the purity: The trio&#x27;s hypnotic repetitive piece relies only on piano, bass, and drums; no electronics, extra keyboards, samples, or lengthy introduction.&quot;

Aside from their work within the group each member has undertaken side projects, recording session work or as a touring band musician. Abrahams formed an ongoing duo with Melanie Oxley (1989–2003), which has released four &quot;moody, emotive soul/pop albums&quot; from &quot;Welcome to Violet&quot; (October 1992) to &quot;Blood Oranges&quot; (April 2003). All three have worked for Stephen Cummings, both collectively and individually.

=== Live performance ===
The Necks performances are always improvised, with the instrumentation of piano, double bass, and drums/percussion (with the occasional exception, e.g., when Chris Abrahams played the Melbourne Town Hall pipe organ instead of piano). Geoff Winston of &quot;London Jazz News&quot; described how &quot;Each performance by [the Necks] begins with a blank page which one of the trio will start to fill in to commence the journey, an uninterrupted set of around forty to sixty minutes. There are no rules, no agreements about who will take that lead and about how the discourse will evolve. The only criteria that apply are those of their own impeccably high standards.&quot; Typically a live performance will begin very quietly with one of the musicians playing a simple figure. One by one, the other two will join with their own contributions–all three players independent yet intertwined. As the &#x27;piece&#x27; builds through subtle micro-changes, the interaction of their instruments creates layers of harmonics and prismatic washes of sound that lead some to apply the genre label &#x27;trance jazz&#x27;.

&quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Kate Hennessy found that &quot;any Necks&#x27; show is a make or break experience. Some find it cathartic, others buckle and ever the twain shall chafe in the washout. The trio&#x27;s routine is to play two improvised sets using just piano, double bass and drums: one set relatively calm; the other dispensing sound of escalating intensity for a long hour. Jazz by name but not by nature – if jazz denotes songs that spark at intervals into fine displays of musicianship and tricky timing, after which one claps, drinks, and feels pretty good about the world and the talent in it. No, The Necks plunge listeners to the kinds of violent psychological depths few other bands can achieve at all, let alone all acoustically.&quot;

=== Studio albums ===
Studio albums by The Necks are also based on improvisations, but the recording process can involve multiple takes and sections which are then edited together into a single composition. Studio recordings often involve extra instrumentation beyond the core piano, bass and drums, including samples, organ (Abrahams), electric guitar (Buck) and appearances by guest musicians.

The Necks have never attempted live performance of studio recordings. When they were approached to perform their debut album &quot;Sex&quot; as part of a series of &quot;classic albums&quot; concerts Chris Abrahams pointed out &quot;That&#x27;s not how we make music. It would make no sense.&quot;

==Soundtracks==
Their soundtrack for &quot;The Boys&quot; (1998) was nominated for ARIA Best Soundtrack Album, AFI Best Musical Score and Australian Guild of Screen Composers Award. They have also recorded soundtracks for &quot;What&#x27;s The Deal?&quot; (1997) and &quot;In the Mind of the Architect&quot; (three one-hour ABC-TV documentaries, 2000).

<text>Paul Francis McDermott (born 17 September 1965), who performs as Paul Mac, is an Australian electropop musician, singer-songwriter, producer and music re-mixer. He was classically trained at Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Mac has formed various bands including Smash Mac Mac (1986–88), The Lab (1989–1998), Itch-E and Scratch-E (1991–present), Boo Boo Mace &amp; Nutcase (1996–98), and The Dissociatives (2003–2005). Mac has released two solo albums, &quot;3000 Feet High&quot; (6 August 2001) and &quot;Panic Room&quot; (17 October 2005) – both appeared in the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 Mac won &#x27;Best Dance Release&#x27; for &quot;3000 Feet High&quot; and was nominated for &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27;. In June 2001 he released his highest charting single, &quot;Just the Thing&quot;, which featured lead vocals by Peta Morris. It reached No. 17 on the ARIA Singles Chart and at the APRA Music Awards of 2002 it won &#x27;Most Performed Dance Work&#x27;.

Mac played with Severed Heads. He was also a touring member of Silverchair as well as recording piano parts for their album, &quot;Young Modern&quot; (March 2007), having worked with frontman Daniel Johns as The Dissociatives previously. He has provided remixes for Silverchair, Powderfinger, The Mark of Cain, Grinspoon, The Cruel Sea, INXS and Placebo. Mac has worked on soundtracks for Baz Luhrmann and on the films &quot;Head On&quot; and &quot;Sample People&quot;. He was the musical director on the Australian TV show, &quot;Good News Week&quot;, and composed music for ABC-TV including &quot;The Afternoon Show&quot;, &quot;EC Plays Lift Off&quot;, &quot;Play School&quot; and TVTV.

==Biography==
Mac was born on 17 September 1965. He is the youngest of seven children and grew up in a strict Catholic family in Sydney. As a teenager Mac played hymns on the organ at his local church, including for weddings and funerals. He later described himself as &quot;the worst Virgo, ex-Catholic you&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. He is a classically trained graduate from Sydney Conservatorium of Music, as a Bachelor of Music Education. In the mid-1980s he was a member of Smash Mac Mac, which were an art noise band covering Talking Heads material – Mac introduced drum machines and electronic elements. In 1987 they issued the album, &quot;Chapter One: Light on the Silo&quot;. In 1989 Mac formed the synthpop, electronica group The Lab in Sydney with Yolanda Podolski on lead vocals, and Warwick Hornby (aka Warwick Factor) on vocals and bass guitar. The group signed with rooArt, which released their two extended plays, &quot;Ultra&quot; (1992) and &quot;Terminal&quot; (1993). They moved to BMG and issued their debut album, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, in 1997. The group disbanded the following year.

===1991–1997: Itch-E and Scratch-E===
In 1991, Mac formed a side-project, Itch-E and Scratch-E, with fellow Sydney-based electronica artist, Andy Rantzen of the group, Pelican Daughters. Both provided keyboards and samplers. Itch-E and Scratch-E became their main focus with the success of their debut album, &quot;Itch-E Kitch-E Koo&quot; (1993), and its related single, &quot;Sweetness and Light&quot; (1994). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 the single won Best Dance Release. During his acceptance speech Mac controversially declared, &quot;We&#x27;d like to thank all of Sydney&#x27;s ecstasy dealers, without whom this award would not be possible&quot;. One of the sponsors of the ceremony was the National Drug Offensive, which withdrew their support. In 2005, Mac explained that he did not expect to win and so had not prepared a speech. The group often includes Sherriff Lindo for live performances. From 1996 to 1998, Mac and Rantzen also performed as Boo Boo and Mace!, and with Lindo aboard they worked as Boo Boo Mace &#x27;n&#x27; Nutcase.

===1997–2000: work with Silverchair, &quot;Paul Mac Presents SnapShots&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Rock&quot;===
In 1997, Mac remixed the single, &quot;Freak&quot;, from Australian post-grunge band Silverchair&#x27;s second album, &quot;Freak Show&quot;. The track was issued in April as a B-side of their second single from that album, &quot;Abuse Me&quot;.

In 1998, Mac released a four-track EP, &quot;Paul Mac Presents Snapshots&quot;, on Interdance Records. It featured guest vocals by Stephen Allkins on &quot;Ooh I Love Your (Disco)&quot;, Infusion on &quot;Loco&quot;, Phil Smart on &quot;Basic Boom&quot; and Abel El Toro on &quot;All Systems Are Go&quot;. Mac again worked with Silverchair&#x27;s Daniel Johns as an alternative rock duo to release a five-track extended play, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Rock&quot; (2000).

===2001–2005: &quot;3000 Feet High&quot;, The Dissociatives and &quot;Panic Room&quot;===
On 6 August 2001, Mac issued his debut solo album, &quot;3000 Feet High&quot;, which peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, felt the album was an &quot;emotional journey&quot; where &quot;[t]hroughout, the dancefloor taunts us like a temptress, determined to lure us into her arms, but we&#x27;re torn between her charms and the inner us which the dance beats may drown out&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Just the Thing&quot;, reached No. 17 on the ARIA Singles Chart and featured lead vocals by Peta Morris. In December 2001 he performed at Homebake on the Big Top stage. At the APRA Music Awards of 2002 &quot;Just the Thing&quot; won &#x27;Most Performed Dance Work&#x27; and was nominated for &#x27;Most Performed Australian Work&#x27;. In January 2002, and again in 2006, Mac appeared at Splendour in the Grass. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 Mac won &#x27;Best Dance Release&#x27; for &quot;3000 Feet High&quot; and was nominated for &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; and &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27;.

Mac and Johns co-wrote the music for &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot; (2001) episode 13, &quot;Split&quot;.
In mid-2003, the Mac and Johns formed another alternative rock group, The Dissociatives, which issued their debut album of the same name in April 2004. Their first live show was in Hobart in June of that year. Mac explained his motivation, &quot;As music narrows out into increasingly smaller genres, it&#x27;s important to bring the fun of making music back into play. Not following any predetermined rules and making the most honest beautiful music we could is fun&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 Mac and Johns were nominated for &#x27;Producer of the Year&#x27; for the album.

Mac&#x27;s second album, &quot;Panic Room&quot;, appeared on 17 October 2005, and reached the top 40. Johns had advised Mac to &quot;follow your dreams regardless of what outside fashion is saying you should be doing&quot;. Vocals are variously supplied by Morris, Sarah McLeod, Luke Steele, Abby Dobson (ex-Leonardo&#x27;s Bride), Lenka, and Ngaiire. Mac explained seeing Joseph, on TV in August 2004, &quot;I was watching the episode of [&quot;Australian Idol&quot;] when she got kicked out and I thought &#x27;who is this girl, she is fantastic&#x27;... I tracked her down and gave her a call. It turned out great. I am just really happy with the whole album&quot;. For Silverchair&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Young Modern&quot;, Mac supplied piano and toured with the group providing keyboards and piano on stage.

===2008–2014: soundtracks, remixes and touring===
In 2008, Mac provided the music for a one-man comedy play, &quot;Possessed&quot;, performed by Frank Woodley. In March that year, he supplied the theme song, &quot;The Only One&quot; for the feature film, &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Esther Blueburger&quot;, with three versions on the soundtrack: one had vocals by Bertie Blackman, another by Sydney Children&#x27;s Choir and one was an instrumental. He formed a production duo, Stereogamous, with Jonny Seymour (aka DJ Seymour Butz), in 2010 they worked on LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s single, &quot;I Can Change&quot;, from their album, &quot;This Is Happening&quot;. They have also remixed &quot;Cupid Boy&quot; for Kylie Minogue and &quot;Bring Night&quot; for Sia. In 2011 they worked on George Michael&#x27;s track, &quot;Every Other Lover in the World&quot;. Mac co-wrote &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care What You Say&quot; with its performer Anthony Callea and Cindy Ryan (of Stella One Eleven); it was released in February 2012 by Callea on his seven-track EP, &quot;Last to Go&quot;, which was co-produced by Mac. On 6 September, the feature film, &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot;, premiered with Mac&#x27;s musical score. He also has a cameo in the final scene.

===2015–present: &quot;Holiday From Me&quot; and &quot;Mesmerism&quot;===
On 22 January 2015, Mac announced the forthcoming release of his third studio album, titled &quot;Holiday From Me&quot;. It will feature Megan Washington, Brendan Maclean, Dave Mason and Nathan Hudson on vocals.

In February 2019, Mac released a new single titled &quot;Cataplexy&quot; and confirmed a new album is coming soon. In April, Mac confirmed the album is titled &quot;Mesmerism&quot; and will be released on 3 May 2019.

==Academic career==
Decades after completing his earlier music degree, Mac returned to his alma mater, Sydney Conservatorium of Music, for postgraduate study. In 2021, he graduated with a Doctor of Musical Arts qualification in composition, based on fusing electronic dance music traditions with experimental practice. As at 2022, he holds an academic staff role at the Conservatorium, teaching Contemporary Music Practice courses within its Bachelor of Music programme.

==Personal life==
In October 2004, Mac was living in Erskineville. Mac is openly gay; in 2007, he reminisced about his first attendance at Sydney&#x27;s Mardi Gras in the 1980s: &quot;I can&#x27;t remember who the act even was – it was a long time ago ... I wasn&#x27;t really out – actually, I wasn&#x27;t out at all. I just ended up at the party and I remember realising that there was this whole world out there that I felt really proud to be a part of. There was such a sense of wonder&quot;.

<doc id="427499" wikidata="Q3241589" url="?curid=427499" title="Proteinogenic amino acid">
<text>Proteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are incorporated biosynthetically into proteins during translation from RNA. The word &quot;proteinogenic&quot; means &quot;protein creating&quot;. Throughout known life, there are 22 genetically encoded (proteinogenic) amino acids, 20 in the standard genetic code and an additional 2 (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms.

In contrast, non-proteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are either not incorporated into proteins (like GABA, -DOPA, or triiodothyronine), misincorporated in place of a genetically encoded amino acid, or not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (like hydroxyproline). The latter often results from post-translational modification of proteins. Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are incorporated into nonribosomal peptides which are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.

Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes can incorporate selenocysteine into their proteins via a nucleotide sequence known as a SECIS element, which directs the cell to translate a nearby UGA codon as selenocysteine (UGA is normally a stop codon). In some methanogenic prokaryotes, the UAG codon (normally a stop codon) can also be translated to pyrrolysine.

In eukaryotes, there are only 21 proteinogenic amino acids, the 20 of the standard genetic code, plus selenocysteine. Humans can synthesize 12 of these from each other or from other molecules of intermediary metabolism. The other nine must be consumed (usually as their protein derivatives), and so they are called essential amino acids. The essential amino acids are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine (i.e. H, I, L, K, M, F, T, W, V).

The proteinogenic amino acids have been found to be related to the set of amino acids that can be recognized by ribozyme autoaminoacylation systems. Thus, non-proteinogenic amino acids would have been excluded by the contingent evolutionary success of nucleotide-based life forms. Other reasons have been offered to explain why certain specific non-proteinogenic amino acids are not generally incorporated into proteins; for example, ornithine and homoserine cyclize against the peptide backbone and fragment the protein with relatively short half-lives, while others are toxic because they can be mistakenly incorporated into proteins, such as the arginine analog canavanine.

The evolutionary selection of certain proteinogenic amino acids from the primordial soup has been suggested to be because of their better incorporation into a polypeptide chain as opposed to non-proteinogenic amino acids.

== Structures ==
The following illustrates the structures and abbreviations of the 21 amino acids that are directly encoded for protein synthesis by the genetic code of eukaryotes. The structures given below are standard chemical structures, not the typical zwitterion forms that exist in aqueous solutions.

IUPAC/IUBMB now also recommends standard abbreviations for the following two amino acids:
== Chemical properties ==

Following is a table listing the one-letter symbols, the three-letter symbols, and the chemical properties of the side chains of the standard amino acids. The masses listed are based on weighted averages of the elemental isotopes at their natural abundances. Forming a peptide bond results in elimination of a molecule of water. Therefore, the protein&#x27;s mass is equal to the mass of amino acids the protein is composed of minus 18.01524 Da per peptide bond.

===General chemical properties===
===Side-chain properties===

§: Values for Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Lys &amp; Tyr were determined using the amino acid residue placed centrally in an alanine pentapeptide. The value for Arg is from Pace &quot;et al.&quot; (2009). The value for Sec is from Byun &amp; Kang (2011).

N.D.: The pKa value of Pyrrolysine has not been reported.

Note: The pKa value of an amino-acid residue in a small peptide is typically slightly different when it is inside a protein. Protein pKa calculations are sometimes used to calculate the change in the pKa value of an amino-acid residue in this situation.

===Gene expression and biochemistry===

* UAG is normally the amber stop codon, but in organisms containing the biological machinery encoded by the pylTSBCD cluster of genes the amino acid pyrrolysine will be incorporated.
** UGA is normally the opal (or umber) stop codon, but encodes selenocysteine if a SECIS element is present.
† The stop codon is not an amino acid, but is included for completeness.
†† UAG and UGA do not always act as stop codons (see above).
‡ An essential amino acid cannot be synthesized in humans and must, therefore, be supplied in the diet. Conditionally essential amino acids are not normally required in the diet, but must be supplied exogenously to specific populations that do not synthesize it in adequate amounts.
&amp; Occurrence of amino acids is based on 135 Archaea, 3775 Bacteria, 614 Eukaryota proteomes and human proteome (21 006 proteins) respectively.

===Mass spectrometry===
In mass spectrometry of peptides and proteins, knowledge of the masses of the residues is useful. The mass of the peptide or protein is the sum of the residue masses plus the mass of water (Monoisotopic mass = 18.01056 Da; average mass = 18.0153 Da). The residue masses are calculated from the tabulated chemical formulas and atomic weights. In mass spectrometry, ions may also include one or more protons (Monoisotopic mass = 1.00728 Da; average mass* = 1.0074 Da). *Protons cannot have an average mass, this confusingly infers to Deuterons as a valid isotope, but they should be a different species (see Hydron (chemistry))
§ Monoisotopic mass

===Stoichiometry and metabolic cost in cell===
The table below lists the abundance of amino acids in &quot;E.coli&quot; cells and the metabolic cost (ATP) for synthesis of the amino acids. Negative numbers indicate the metabolic processes are energy favorable and do not cost net ATP of the cell. The abundance of amino acids includes amino acids in free form and in polymerization form (proteins).

===Remarks===

===Catabolism===
Amino acids can be classified according to the properties of their main products:

* Glucogenic, with the products having the ability to form glucose by gluconeogenesis
* Ketogenic, with the products not having the ability to form glucose: These products may still be used for ketogenesis or lipid synthesis.
* Amino acids catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic products

<text>The Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan is a communist party in Kyrgyzstan, founded on 22 June 1992. It publishes the daily newspaper &quot;Pravda Kyrgyzstana&quot; (). The party considers itself to be the successor of the Communist Party of Kirghizia, which ruled Kyrgyzstan during the Soviet era.

== History ==
It was the largest political party in the Legislative Assembly of Kyrgyzstan between 2001 and 2005, with 15 of the 60 seats. In the 2005 parliamentary election it won one of the 75 seats. Two years later, the party took eight seats in the larger 90-seat Supreme Council. However, the party failed to win any seats in successive legislative elections held in 2010 and 2015. In the 2020 parliamentary election, party leader Iskhak Masaliyev ran on the United Kyrgyzstan list.

The party was formerly led by Absamat Masaliyev, a former leader of the Kirghiz SSR during the Soviet era, until his death in 2004. The party&#x27;s current chairman is Bumairam Mamaseitova.

<text>The Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition (NPC) is a conservative political party in the Philippines which was founded in 1992 by presidential candidate Danding Cojuangco.

==History==

=== 1992 ===

The NPC was founded in 1991 after members of the Nacionalista Party, led by Rizal governor Isidro Rodriguez, left the party after disagreements with party leader and vice president Salvador &quot;Doy&quot; Laurel before the 1992 presidential elections. Members of civil society (including the business sector) who called themselves &quot;Friends of Danding&quot; invited tycoon Eduardo &quot;Danding&quot; Cojuangco, a former associate of Ferdinand Marcos, to run as president with Senator Joseph Estrada as vice president. Cojuangco lost the presidential race, finishing third, and Estrada won the vice presidency in a landslide. 

=== 1998 ===
The NPC was a member of the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP), the political vehicle of vice president Joseph Estrada in the 1998 presidential elections. It left the LAMMP after Estrada was removed from power in January 2001. 

=== 2001 ===
When Gloria Macapagal Arroyo assumed the presidency, her People Power Coalition (led by the Lakas–CMD party) became the dominant group in Congress. The 75-member Lakas party led the &quot;Sunshine Coalition,&quot; which included the 61-member NPC, members of the Liberal Party, and several other minor parties. The Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) party led the 20-member opposition bloc. 

===2003===

In 2003, after the failure of impeachment filing in the House against Chief Justice Hilario Davide, rumors speculated that the coalition will go to abolishment, as pro-impeachment congressmen, mainly from the NPC disappointed in the failure of impeachment. The rumors spread, also saying that there is a faction that are lacking of satisfaction on de Venecia and will challenge his speakership. NPC later prompted to quit in the coalition for the 2004 elections, and later rumored to join the opposition.

=== 2004 ===
In 2003, the LDP and NPC backed businessman Danding Cojuangco as a potential presidential candidate in that year&#x27;s elections. Cojuangco, the NPC chair, withdrew from the campaign. But before the end of the year, NPC was sending &#x27;mixed signals&#x27; that possibly confuse the public whether they will stay on the administration camp or jump into the opposition. Although the NPC had no seats in the Senate, the party had 53 seats in the House of Representatives after the election. 

=== 2010 ===
Two of its House stalwarts, Chiz Escudero and Gilbert Teodoro (a nephew of Cojuangco) left NPC for their presidential ambitions. Teodoro joined Lakas–Kampi and launched his presidential campaign there, while Escudero planned also to run for presidency, but later withdrawn his bid and launched NoyBi. NPC, led by its new chairman Faustino Dy Jr., forged a coalition with Manny Villar&#x27;s Nacionalista to support the latter&#x27;s presidential campaign with selection of Loren Legarda as running mate. 

=== 2013 ===
With Tito Sotto&#x27;s chairmanship assumption, NPC forged an alliance with the administration&#x27;s Team PNoy.

=== 2022 ===
After Cojuangco&#x27;s death in 2020, NPC supported the vice presidential campaign of its chairman Sotto. But, in the preferences of presidential candidates, majority of them supported either Bongbong Marcos, or Panfilo Lacson&#x27;s campaign.

==1995 election==
The NPC fielded a 12-person Senatorial slate in the 1995 elections as an opposition party to the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos. They ran against the administration-backed Lakas–Laban Coalition.

== Candidates ==

<text>The United National Party (UNP; , ) is a centre-right political party in Sri Lanka. The UNP has served as the country&#x27;s ruling party, or as part of its governing coalition, for 38 of the country&#x27;s 74 years of independence, including the periods 19471956, 19651970, 19771994, 20012004 and 20152019. The party also controlled the executive presidency from its formation in 1978 until 1994 and again from 2022 to 2024.

The UNP has been led by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe since 1994. The party is a member of the International Democracy Union.

==History==
===Formation (1946–1952)===

The UNP was founded by Don Stephen Senanayake in 1946 by amalgamating three right-leaning, pro-dominion parties from the majority Sinhalese community and minority Tamil and Muslim communities. Senanayake had earlier resigned from the Ceylon National Congress due to its revised aim in achieving independence from the British Empire. The UNP represented the business community and the landed gentry, though Senanayake appealed to landless people by adopting populist policies. His agricultural policies allowed many landless people to relocate under productive colonization schemes, which resulted in Sri Lankan agricultural production rising. Senanayake became popular enough to be called the &quot;father of the nation&quot;.

Senanayake refused a knighthood, but maintained good relations with Britain and was a Privy Counsellor. He launched major irrigation and hydro-power projects such as the Gal Oya project (which relocated over 250,000 people), Udawalawa tank, Senanayaka tank, and several other multipurpose projects. He also renovated historic sites in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and played a major role in the Colombo plan. During his tenure, free education commenced and the University of Peradeniya opened.

However, his government proceeded to disenfranchise the plantation workers of Indian descent, the Indian Tamils, using the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 and the Parliamentary Elections Amendment Act of 1949. These measures were intended primarily to electorally undermine the Left.

===Dudley Senanayake era (1952–1953)===
In July 1951, long-standing UNP stalwart Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike, a Buddhist nationalist leader known for his centre-left views, quit the UNP to found the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as a balancing force between the UNP and Marxist parties. In March 1952, Prime Minister Senanayake died in a riding accident and was succeeded by his son Dudley Senanayake.

During his tenure, Dudley Senanayake launched several projects to further develop the agricultural sector and was termed &quot;Bath Dun Piya&quot; (English: the father who offered free rice to the nation). To improve the agricultural sector, he created Bathalegoda Paddy research centre, Thalawakele Tea research centre and Lunuwila Coconut research centre. He also founded Moratuwa University, Ampara Higher Technology Institution, and many technical colleges. During this period, Bhikku University commenced and Poya was declared a government-recognized holiday.

===Kotelawala era (1953–1958)===
The UNP attempted to reduce the rice ration, resulting in the 1953 Hartal (general strike and protest), which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. He was succeeded by his cousin, Colonel Sir John Kotelawala, who launched several major power generation and infrastructure projects. These include: the Lakshapana hydropower project; Bambalapitiya, a housing project for the homeless; modernizing of the Ratmalana Airport; construction of the Kelaniya Bridge; and the development of Buddhist religious sites.

There was growing disaffection with the UNP particularly because of its support of minority religious groups – most notably Catholics – to the consternation of the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese. Bandaranaike was able to take advantage and lead the SLFP to victory in the 1956 elections, while the UNP returned only eight members to parliament. Kotelawala stepped down as party leader and went into self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom.

===Second Dudley Senanayake era (1958–1972)===
Bandaranaike passed the controversial Sinhala Only Act, which led to communal clashes in 1958. Dudley Senanayake retook party leadership, and the UNP held power for three months in 1960. The UNP entered a coalition with the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and the Tamil ethnic Federal Party which took power in 1965 under Dudley Senanayake. The coalition lost in a 1970 landslide to the United Front alliance of the SLFP with Marxist Parties. A bitter leadership battle in the UNP developed between the populist Dudley Senanayake and the more conservative Junius Richard Jayewardene, a strong supporter of free-market and pro-American policies. The latter was nicknamed as &quot;Yankee Dickey&quot;.

During the tenure of Dudley Senanayake, English education was made compulsory.

===Jayawardene era (1972–1988)===

After Dudley Senanayake&#x27;s death in 1973, Jayewardene became the leader of the UNP and reorganized the party at the grassroots level.

The United Front faced general disaffection from its economic policies and its brutal crackdown against a 1971 Marxist–Leninist insurrection by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The UNP, which promised each person with an cereal ration, returned to power in 1977 with an unprecedented five-sixths majority in parliament.

Jayewardene was elected president by Parliament and, in 1978, introduced a new constitution which transformed the presidency into an executive post with sweeping powers.

The UNP opened the economy and made sweeping policy changes. Free-trade zones such as in Katunayaka and Biyagama attracted foreign investment and generated employment. The government undertook massive development work to promote hydroelectricity and agriculture. Reservoirs were built at Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe and Kotmale, while Maduru Oya and Lunugamwehera reservoirs were reconstructed. He awarded &quot;Swarnabhoomi&quot; land deeds to people and established administration centres such as Isurupaya and Sethsiripaya to create the new administrative capital in Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, where a new Parliament Building was constructed.

In schools, the Mahapola scholarship programme was launched, free school books were provided, and information technology was introduced. Jayawardene&#x27;s administration created the University of Ruhuna and Eastern University as well as the medical faculty of Jaffna university. Bandaranayake International Airport was modernized and Air Lanka was created. He also modernized the military and created the Police Special Task Force.

By 1987, the Sri Lankan military had cornered the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Jaffna and were confident of bringing an end to the civil war. However, due to internal pressure, airdropped supplies to the besieged LTTE.

===Premadasa era (1988–1993)===
Jayewardene retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Ranasinghe Premadasa, a populist leader from the lower class known for his anti-Indian sentiment. After he was elected as president in 1988, he launched the Million Houses Programme for the homeless and started the &#x27;Village Re-Awakening Movement&#x27; (Gam Udawa) to develop rural areas across the country. Premadasa&#x27;s people-oriented programs include the Janasaviya, the Garment Factories Programme, and decentralization of the administration to Divisional Secretariats. He also created the National Housing Development Authority, Urban Development Authority, Central Environmental Authority, Janasaviya Trust Fund, Housing Development Finance Corporation and the Institute for Construction Training and Development.

Despite these developments, many of his political enemies &quot;disappeared&quot; during his reign, most notably the journalist Richard de Zoysa. In 1993, Premadasa was assassinated by LTTE suicide cadres at a May Day rally.

===Wickremesinghe era===
====Opposition (1994–2001)====

In the 1994 election, the People&#x27;s Alliance gained control of parliament after 17 years of unbroken UNP rule. While in opposition, many of UNP stalwarts were killed by an LTTE suicide terrorist attack including presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake. Party leadership was passed to Jayewardene&#x27;s nephew, Ranil Wickremesinghe, a relatively young politician with pro-western views and a penchant for neoliberal economic policies.

====In government (2001–2004)====
By 2001 the country was facing the worst economic downturn since independence, with rising inflation and a power crisis. GDP was shrinking by 2.5%. The SLFP government fell on a no-confidence motion by the opposition, which prompted President Kumaratunga to call for early elections. Wickremesinghe secured the support of former government notables, including former Kumaratunga confidants, G. L. Peiris, and S. B. Dissanayake, who would later become important members of the party. On a platform of peace with LTTE and economic resurgence, the UNP returned to power in the 2001 election, taking all but one district. Wickremesinghe became prime minister of a &quot;co-habitation&quot; government with President Kumaratunga.

Within two months into his premiership, Wickremesinghe signed a pivotal ceasefire agreement with the LTTE. The agreement was followed by intense peace negotiations towards a solution to the ethnic conflict. During Eelam War III, which followed as the negotiations were not yet complete, the LTTE proceeded to seize territories that it had lost.

The UNP government maintained strict fiscal discipline and market-friendly policies, which led to economic recovery, large-scale investment, and rapid economic growth. The government created key economic institutions such as the Board of Investment, the Ministry for Small and Rural Enterprises, and the Information Communication Technology Agency. Economic growth continued to accelerate, reaching almost 6% at the end of 2003, while inflation was at an all-time low of under 2%. Many local and foreign experts believed that Sri Lanka could reach double-digit economic growth within a few years.

However, cease-fire breaches by the LTTE, including the constant stream of assassinations of military spies, emboldedend nationalistic and extremist factions such as the JVP and its cover organizations to organise protests. They tried to convince the public that Wickremesinghe was giving too much away to the LTTE. Hardline Sinhalese Buddhist organizations such as the Sinhala Urumaya (Sinhalese Heritage) criticized the government for this and for allegedly pandering to western evangelical Christian organizations, endangering Buddhism. The Sinhala Urumaya later rename themselves as Jathika Hela Urumaya (National Sinhalese Heritage) and put forward Buddhist monks to contest elections.

In late 2003 the president took over the National Lotteries Board. The UNP blocked this move by surrounding the government press so that the gazette could not be printed. As a retaliatory move, the president then took over the ministries of Mass Communications, Defence, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was visiting George W. Bush in Washington DC. Kumaratunga and her confidants launched a massive media attack on their nominal partners, branding Wickremesinghe as a traitor and accusing the UNP government of &quot;selling&quot; national heritage sites to foreigners.

====Opposition (2004–2015)====
Early in 2004, the SLFP and JVP formed the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), marking the beginning of the end for the UNP government. In February 2004, within 24 hours of delivering a speech for national unity, Kumaratunga dissolved parliament. In the subsequent election on 2 April 2004, the UNP was defeated by the UPFA. Wickremesinghe remained as leader of the UNP.

In the presidential election of 17 November 2005, Wickremesinghe, came second with 48.43% of the vote. It is widely believed that if not for the boycott of the polls in the North and parts of the East, allegedly due to LTTE intimidation, Wickramsinghe would have won, though he was unable to gain the trust of the bulk of the majority Sinhalese community.

In early 2007, 18 senior members of the UNP joined President Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s ruling coalition, receiving ministerial positions. This resulted in a state of political unrest, as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the President and the UNP leader in late 2006 was read as no longer valid. This incident, generally recorded in the press as &#x27;crossovers&#x27;, also resulted in a state where a number of senior officials expressed concern over the &#x27;jumbo cabinet&#x27;. On 9 February 2007, the president sacked three ministers for their remarks against the new political configuration.

UNP and twelve other opposition parties in parliament signed an opposition alliance on 3 November 2009.

After winning the 30-year long war against LTTE in 2009, President Rajapaksa called for an early presidential election in 2010. UNP and JVP backed General Sarath Fonseka as presidential candidate. This was the first time UNP backed a non-UNP member for president. However, Rajapaksa won the election with 57.88% of the popular vote. In April, Rajapaksa called for a general election and UPFA won a majority of 144 seats while UNF received 60 seats.

====In government (2015–2019)====
President Rajapaksa, seeking a third term, called for an early election in 2015. UNP and several other parties backed SLFP&#x27;s general secretary and health minister, Maithripala Sirisena, as common candidate. Sirisena emerged victorious with 51.28% of the popular vote in an election which saw a record turnout of 81.52%. Sirisena was sworn in as executive president while Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as prime minister. Over 70% of the ministerial posts in the Sirisena cabinet went to the UNP and Minister Lakshman Kiriella was appointed the leader of the house. The new government presented a budget to parliament two weeks later, giving benefits including a pay hike and reduced prices on 13 goods. The National Medicine Regulatory Authority Bill was passed, providing for the establishment of a regulatory authority to be known as the National Medicines Regulatory Authority. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was approved by the Cabinet at an emergency Cabinet meeting on 16 March 2015.

UNP won a majority of seats (106) in the 2015 general elections and Wickremesinghe was appointed prime minister. UNP signed a memorandum of understanding with SLFP for a national unity government, and Wickremesinghe made cabinet appointments from both parties. The unity government would last for at least 2 years, in order to address unresolved issues from the 30-year Sri Lanka Civil War.

Wickremesinghe asked parliament for permission to exceed the constitutional limitation of 30 cabinet ministers. This motion was approved by the parliament with 143 in favour, 16 against and 63 absent.

The popularity of the government declined, and UNP suffered a defeat in the 2018 local authority elections. They were only able to secure 34 of 340 councils while Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s proxy Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won 231 councils. UNP secured only 29.42% against the 40.47% of the SLPP and the 12.10% of the SLFP.

====Split and total collapse in opposition (2019–2022)====

In the 2019 presidential election, the UNP nominated Sajith Premadasa as its candidate after much delay due to internal conflicts. Premadasa was defeated by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who gained 52.25% of the votes against 41.99% by Premadasa. Premadasa was chosen by the party to serve as opposition leader until fresh elections were called in April 2020.

The party had a major split in early 2020 when its working committee became divided over a new alliance that it had previously approved. Leadership of the alliance was given to its deputy leader, the popular Sajith Premadasa. Over three-quarters of the parliamentary group refused to sign nominations from the party, instead making nominations under the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (English: Peace People&#x27;s Power, SJB) alliance. As a result, ninety-nine of the party&#x27;s seniors were suspended from its membership. Party supporters moved to the new alliance, along with supporting minority parties.

After failed negotiations, the SJB and the UNP decided to contest the 2020 parliamentary elections separately. Delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 parliamentary elections resulted in a landslide victory of the SLPP, which gained 59.09% of the votes and secured a 145-seat parliamentary majority, while the SJB gained 23.90% votes and 54 seats. The UNP suffered its worst defeat, receiving only 2.15% of votes cast. For the first time, it almost failed to win a single seat in parliament, having only gained one national list seat.

Following the party&#x27;s defeat in the parliamentary elections, Wickremesinghe indicated on several occasions his willingness to step down as party leader after serving for more than 25 years. He declared that the party would wait with appointing the sole national seat until the new leader would be selected so that he or she could be represented in parliament. However, he failed to follow up on his original statements and Wickremesinghe continuously postponed the decision on the two positions. Ultimately, he remained party leader and also took the sole parliamentary seat for himself in June 2021.

====In government (2022–2024)====
Due to the worsening economic crisis and widespread protests in 2022, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who wished to form a government of national unity, invited Wickremesinghe to once again assume the office of Prime Minister as a reconciliatory effort towards the opposition. The relevant parties represented in parliament, Samagi Jana Banawegaya and Tamil National Alliance, refused to take up portfolios in such a cabinet, however they offered conditional support to policies aimed at reviving the economy. Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister despite his party having only one seat in parliament, a first in Sri Lankan parliamentary history.

On 9 July 2022, protestors stormed and occupied the presidential residence as economic conditions got worse. Wickremesinghe agreed to resign while President Gotabaya Rajapaksa agreed to resign on the 13th.

However, on the morning of 13 July, Rajapaksa fled the country, accompanied by his spouse and a personal security detail, to the Maldives. The Speaker of Parliament announced in the afternoon that President Rajapaksa appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as acting president in his absence. Protesters stormed the office of the Prime Minister demanding his resignation. The next day, Rajapaksa emailed a letter of resignation to the Speaker of the Parliament.

On 15 July, the Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abewardhana announced the official resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Ranil Wickremesinghe was officially sworn in as the acting president, and was later elected by the Parliament of Sri Lanka to complete the remainder of Rajapaksa&#x27;s term.

As Wickremesinghe&#x27;s term was coming to an end in 2024, there were many speculations whether Wickremesinghe would run for a term of his own right in the 2024 presidential election. By mid-2024, Wickremesinghe himself was hinting that he would run for re-election. As the election was called in August 2024, Wickremesinghe announced that he would run for re-election as an independent candidate. He was endorsed by the UNP and a breakaway faction of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. He was also endorsed by several minor parties which had endorsed Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019, such as the Ceylon Workers&#x27; Congress, Eelam People&#x27;s Democratic Party, and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. This was Wickremesinghe&#x27;s third bid for the presidency, and his first time not running as a candidate of the UNP.

Wickremesinghe was eliminated at the end of the first phase of the vote counting, finishing in third place with only 17.27% of the vote, compared to NPP candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake&#x27;s 42.31% and SJB candidate Sajith Premadasa&#x27;s 32.76%. As the second preferences count concluded, Anura Kumara Dissanayake was declared the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka. Wickremesinghe left the Presidential Secretariat on 23 September 2024, allowing for a peaceful transition of power to Dissanayake, who succeeded him as President. He also stated that he would not run for reelection again following his defeat, as part of the UNP tradition.

<text>The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement ( , MNR) is now a centre-right, conservative political party in Bolivia. It was the leading force behind the Bolivian National Revolution from 1952 to 1964. It influenced much of the country&#x27;s history since 1941.

==Origins==

The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was begun in 1941 by future presidents Víctor Paz Estenssoro and Hernán Siles Zuazo. It soon attracted some of the brightest members of the Bolivian intelligentsia. Among the party&#x27;s most prominent supporters were Humberto Guzmán Fricke, Juan Lechín, Carlos Montenegro, Walter Guevara Arze, Javier del Granado, Augusto Céspedes, Lydia Gueiler, Guillermo Bedregal, and Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, a number of whom later became presidents of Bolivia.

At the time of its establishment it was a leftist/reformist party, along the lines of similar Latin American parties such as the Brazilian Labour Party, the Socialist Party of Chile, the National Liberation Party in Costa Rica, Dominican Revolutionary Party, the Guatemalan Revolutionary Action Party, the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance in Peru, Democratic Action in Venezuela. The MNR first came to power in 1943, as supporters of the reformist military regime of Gualberto Villarroel.

==Bolivian National Revolution==
The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement led the leftist Bolivian National Revolution of 1952 and ruled the country until 1964 when it was overthrown by the military coup of René Barrientos. During the presidencies of Paz Estenssoro (1952–56 and 1960–64) and Hernán Siles Zuazo (1956–60) were the top leaders of the Revolutionary period, establishing the universal vote, nationalizing the tin mines, and instituting an extensive agrarian reform. During this time many of the old elitist parties which had previously dominated Bolivian politics either disappeared or faded into irrelevance. This left the MNR in the center of the Bolivian political spectrum.

Siles and Paz split in the 1960s over Paz&#x27;s ambitions and personal control of the party. Filled with many strong personalities, the party had in fact begun to fragment along political and personal lines since the late 1950s, with Wálter Guevara being the first to leave and the popular Juan Lechín being expelled in 1964. Siles went on to form the Revolutionary Nationalist Leftwing Movement (MNRI) and Lechín the Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left (PRIN).

==Further splits and return to democracy==
Falling from power only deepened the intra-party squabbles. With the main body of the MNR firmly behind Paz Estenssoro, the old leader made what can be seen as a major mistake in 1971, when he supported the coup d&#x27;état of Hugo Banzer Suárez. He apparently believed that Banzer would only rule for a year or two before calling elections that the MNR would almost certainly win. If so, he badly miscalculated; Banzer exiled Paz in 1975. The main body supported Paz in exile, while a faction continued to back Banzer.

Paz&#x27; support of the Banzer dictatorship was a move that was to cost his party dearly at the polls in subsequent years. While Paz seemed to be moving steadily to the right, Siles Zuazo broke off to found the left-leaning Left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNRI) in 1971. Indeed, Siles was the post-MNR politician who was best able to capitalize on the remaining legitimacy and respect that MNR had as a result of the 1952 Revolution. Paz Estenssoro led the MNR-proper in the Bolivian general elections of 1978, 1979, and 1980 elections, finishing third, second, and second, respectively.

Led by Sánchez de Lozada, the MNR won the 1993 elections and Sanchez was confirmed as president by parliament. He continued the policies of the NEP. The party placed second in 1997 elections, with the presidential candidate Juan Carlos Durán (at the time, the Bolivian constitution prohibited direct re-election of a sitting president) losing to the former dictator Banzer.

===21st century===
At the legislative elections 2002 MNR in alliance with Free Bolivia Movement, won 26.9% of the popular vote and 36 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 11 out of 27 in the Senate. Following these elections, because no presidential candidate had received a majority, the Congress chose the President, and they again elected Sánchez de Lozada. After the 2002 elections, the party ruled in a coalition with the Revolutionary Left Movement. In 2003 Sanchez was forced to resign, and his successor, independent candidate Carlos Mesa took over in hopes of promoting national unity in the face of nationwide protests. Mesa soon resigned and presidential elections were scheduled for December 2005. In these elections MNR received only 6.5% of the popular vote and won 7 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 1 out of 27 seats in the Senate. Its candidate in the presidential elections was Michiaki Nagatani, whose poor performance demonstrated a steep decline in the fortunes of the party as the Bolivian political scene began to be dominated by Evo Morales.

For the 2009 elections, the MNR was a component of the Plan Progress for Bolivia – National Convergence. The party&#x27;s future is uncertain as it is no longer represented in the parliament and its last government has been tarnished by serious accusations of corruption, economic mismanagement and armed suppression of protesters.

The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement currently is led by Luis Eduardo Siles.

<text>Siumut (; , , , SIU) is a political party in Greenland in the social democratic tradition. Since the establishment of home rule in 1979, it has been the dominant party in Greenland. Siumut is led by Erik Jensen, who beat the then-incumbent Prime Minister Kim Kielsen in a tight leadership contest in late 2020.

Party members have been elected to both the parliament of Greenland and the parliament of Denmark.

Siumut was formed in 1971 as a political movement, and became a party in 1977. Following the establishment of home rule in Greenland in January 1979, the party won 13 of 21 seats in the 1979 Greenlandic general election for the newly formed Parliament of Greenland, and party chairman Jonathan Motzfeldt became the first Prime Minister of Greenland.

==History==
Following the 1991 Greenlandic general election, Motzfeldt stepped down and was replaced by Lars Emil Johansen, also of Siumut, who governed in coalition with Inuit Ataqatigiit.

Between 1997 and 2002, Motzfeldt was again Prime Minister, until he was succeeded by Hans Enoksen. From 1979 until 2009 and since 2013, members of Siumut have served as Greenland&#x27;s Prime Minister. In the 15 November 2005 general election, the party won 30.7% of the popular vote and 10 out of 31 seats in the parliament. In the 2009 general election, it won 26.5% of the popular vote and nine seats and in the 2013 election, it won 42.8% of the popular vote and 14 out of 31 seats. At the 2014 election, the party was still the largest party; however, it lost three members of the parliament and has now 11 members. Siumut further declined to nine seats in the 2018 Greenlandic general election.

==Positions==
The party was an observer affiliate of the Socialist International.

Siumut representatives sitting in the Danish parliament have been attached to the parliamentary group of the Social Democrats.

<doc id="427520" wikidata="Q414157" url="?curid=427520" title="Sarcosine">
<text>Sarcosine, also known as &quot;N&quot;-methylglycine, or monomethylglycine, is a amino acid with the formula CH3N(H)CH2CO2H. It exists at neutral pH as the zwitterion CH3N+(H)2CH2CO2−, which can be obtained as a white, water-soluble powder. Like some amino acids, sarcosine converts to a cation at low pH and an anion at high pH, with the respective formulas CH3N+(H)2CH2CO2H and CH3N(H)CH2CO2−. Sarcosine is a close relative of glycine, with a secondary amine in place of the primary amine.

Sarcosine is ubiquitous in biological materials. It is used in manufacturing biodegradable surfactants and toothpastes as well as in other applications. It is also a reagent in organic synthesis.

Sarcosine is sweet to the taste.

==Biochemistry==
Sarcosine is an intermediate and byproduct in glycine synthesis and degradation. Sarcosine is metabolized to glycine by the enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase, while glycine-&quot;N&quot;-methyl transferase generates sarcosine from glycine. Sarcosine is an amino acid derivative that is naturally found in muscles and other body tissues. In the laboratory, it may be synthesized from chloroacetic acid and methylamine. Sarcosine is an intermediate in the metabolism of choline to glycine. 
Sarcosine, like the related compounds dimethylglycine (DMG) and trimethylglycine (betaine, TMG), is formed via the metabolism of nutrients such as choline and methionine, which both contain methyl groups used in a wide range of biochemical reactions. Sarcosine is rapidly degraded to glycine, which, in addition to its importance as a constituent of protein, plays a significant role in various physiological processes as a prime metabolic source of components of living cells such as glutathione, creatine, purines and serine. The concentration of sarcosine in blood serum of normal human subjects is 1.4 ± 0.6 micromolar.

==Industrial synthesis==
Sarcosine can be produced industrially via the Strecker amino acid synthesis.

==Surfactants==
A variety of surfactants are produced from sarcosine, for instance sodium lauroyl sarcosinate.

==Schizophrenia==
Early evidence suggests sarcosine is an effective and well-tolerated adjuvant to many antipsychotics except clozapine for the treatment of schizophrenia, showing significant reductions in both positive and negative symptoms. 

==Prostate cancer==
Sarcosine has also been debated as a biomarker for prostate cancer cells. More recent research has suggested that sarcosine plays an active role in the progression of prostate cancer, as addition of sarcosine to prostate epithelial cells caused the emergence of a new invasive phenotype. 

==History==
Sarcosine was first isolated and named by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1847.

Jacob Volhard first synthesized it in 1862 while working in the lab of Hermann Kolbe. Prior to the synthesis of sarcosine, it had long been known to be a hydrolysis product of creatine, a compound found in meat extract. Under this assumption, by preparing the compound with methylamine and monochloroacetic acid, Volhard proved that sarcosine was &quot;N&quot;-methylglycine.

<text>Arija is a small town and municipality in the province of Burgos, located to the north of the provincial capital Burgos, in the autonomous community of Castile-Leon, Spain. The town&#x27;s history dates back more than thousand years. Is divided into &#x27;neighborhood above&#x27; and &#x27;neighborhood below&#x27; or &#x27;Vilga&#x27;. It consisted of the Santa Gadea de Alfoz.

The recent history of Arija is linked to the factory of Cristalería Española S.A., that in 1906 settled in the lands of Arija. A French company of the Saint-Gobain Emporium, founded in 1665 by royal privilege of Luis XIV, was specialized in the manufacture of flat glass. This town is now situated on de artificial lake of &quot;Embalso del Ebro&quot; when the Ebro river was dammed.

<text>Lloyd Norman Axworthy (born December 21, 1939) is a Canadian politician, and academic. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Following his retirement from parliament, he served as president and vice-chancellor of the University of Winnipeg from 2004 to 2014 and as chancellor of St. Paul&#x27;s University College (a constituent institution of the University of Waterloo). He is currently the Chair of the World Refugee &amp; Migration Council.

== Biography ==
Axworthy was born in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, to parents Norman and Gwen Axworthy, and he is into a family with strong United Church roots. He received his BA from United College, a Winnipeg-based Bible school, in 1961. He is the older brother of Tom Axworthy and Robert Axworthy (former Manitoba Liberal Party leadership candidate). He received his Ph.D. in politics from Princeton University in 1972 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;The task force on housing and urban development: a study of democratic decision making in Canada.&quot; He returned to Canada to teach at the University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg. At the latter, he also became the director of the Institute of Urban Affairs.

==Early political career==
Axworthy became involved in politics during the 1950s, becoming a member of the Liberal Party after attending a speech by Lester B. Pearson. He briefly aligned himself with the New Democratic Party (NDP) in the 1960s when Pearson, as federal opposition leader, called for American Bomarc nuclear warheads to be allowed on Canadian soil. He soon returned to the Liberal fold, however, and worked as an executive assistant for John Turner; he supported Turner&#x27;s bid to become party leader at the 1968 leadership convention.

Axworthy ran for the party in Winnipeg North Centre in the 1968 election, finishing second against veteran NDP Member of Parliament (MP) Stanley Knowles. He first ran for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1966 election, placing second to Progressive Conservative Douglas Stanes in St. James. In the 1973 election, he was elected as a Manitoba Liberal in Fort Rouge, He was re-elected in the 1977 election, and was the only Liberal in the legislature from 1977 to 1979.

==Federal government==
He resigned from the Manitoba legislature on April 6, 1979, to run for the federal House of Commons, and in the 1979 election narrowly defeated former provincial PC leader Sidney Spivak in Winnipeg—Fort Garry. He was re-elected in the 1980 election, becoming the only Liberal MP west of Ontario. He was promoted to cabinet under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, serving as Minister of Employment and Immigration, and then as Minister of Transport.

In the Liberal defeat in the 1984 election, Axworthy was one of only two Liberals west of Ontario to be elected (the other being then Liberal leader John Turner). Axworthy played a role in opposition, supporting tough on crime policies, but also supporting fiscal conservatism by critiquing the fiscal taxation policy of Brian Mulroney. He was an especially vocal critic of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.

When the Liberals returned to power in 1993 under Jean Chrétien, Axworthy became a Cabinet minister. After the election, he was given responsibility for the Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC), and launched changes in employment insurance. Although his main interest was urban renewal, in a 1996 cabinet shuffle, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs.

In February 1999 and April 2000, Axworthy was President of the United Nations Security Council with Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to the UN Robert Fowler. In April 2000, Axworthy supported the highly controversial effort to reduce the sanction against Iraq, under the regime of Saddam Hussein, citing a humanitarian explanation &quot;to avoid making ordinary citizens pay for the actions of their leaders&quot;. Axworthy clashed with the US government on this issue, particularly over the lack of alternative options to deter the regime from additional aggression. In 2000, he initiated the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty that led to the UN policy of Responsibility to Protect.

He retired from politics at the 2000 federal election, and was succeeded as MP for Winnipeg South Centre by Anita Neville.

==Honours and awards==
In 1997, Axworthy was nominated by United States Senator Patrick Leahy to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on banning land mines. He did not win, but was thanked by the recipients, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, as having been instrumental in their effort. Critics, however, viewed Axworthy&#x27;s land mine campaign and the involvement of political NGOs as counter-productive, since many key nations, including the US, Russia and China did not join.

In 1998, he was one of the two winners of the North–South Prize. In 2003, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

On October 15, 2012, Elder, Dr. Tobasonakwut Kinew and, Dr. Phil Fontaine, honoured Axworthy – Waapshki Pinaysee Inini, White Thunderbird Man, at a sacred Pipe Ceremony. Axworthy was recognized for his commitment to creating an inclusive learning experience that reflects Indigenous cultures and traditions at UWinnipeg. The ceremony was led by Anishinaabe Elder Fred Kelly and musician and broadcaster Wab Kinew.

Axworthy was presented with an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Environment of the University of Waterloo in October 2014.

On December 30, 2015, Axworthy was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest grade of the honour.

==After politics==

In September 2000, Axworthy returned to academia, joining the Liu Institute for Global Issues at the University of British Columbia. He has published &quot;Navigating A New World&quot;, a book on the uses of &quot;soft power&quot;.

In May 2004, he was appointed as president and vice-chancellor of the University of Winnipeg. He retired in June 2014.

Axworthy is Chair of the Advisory Committee for the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, a highly controversial position resulting from this organisation&#x27;s record of political bias, fundraising in Saudi Arabia, and lack of credibility. He also serves on the advisory council of USC Center on Public Diplomacy and of Fair Vote Canada, and is an endorser of the Genocide Intervention Network and International Student Exchange, Ontario.

In 2006, Axworthy was elected to the Board of Directors of Hudbay Minerals, Inc.

He currently serves as the President of the World Federalist Movement-Institute for Global Policy.

Axworthy was installed as Chancellor of St. Paul&#x27;s University College, a constituent institution of the University of Waterloo, in October 2014. He retired from that position in 2017.

Axworthy is the first Chair of the World Refugee &amp; Migration Council, formed in 2017 by the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

<doc id="427535" wikidata="Q334565" url="?curid=427535" title="David Waddington">
<text>David Charles Waddington, Baron Waddington, (2 August 1929 – 23 February 2017) was a British politician and barrister.

A member of the Conservative Party, he served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons from 1968 to 1974 and 1979 to 1990, and was then made a life peer in the House of Lords. During his parliamentary career, Waddington worked in government as Chief Whip, then as Home Secretary and finally as Leader of the House of Lords. He then served as the Governor of Bermuda between 1992 and 1997.

==Early life==
Waddington was born in Burnley, Lancashire, the youngest of five. His father and grandfather were both solicitors in Burnley. He was educated at Cressbrook School and Sedbergh School, both independent schools.

He then attended Hertford College, Oxford, where he became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association. He was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1951.

Waddington failed to adequately defend Stefan Kiszko, a civil servant accused of the murder of Lesley Molseed, at Leeds Crown Court in July 1976 in what would become one of the most notorious miscarriages of justice in British legal history. Waddington did not review or question any of the 6000+ statements that the prosecution presented at the last minute. He also failed to ask about semen evidence that could have proved Kiszko&#x27;s innocence since the sample Kiszko provided did not match semen retained from Molseed&#x27;s body. Kiszko served 16 years in prison, receiving frequent violent attacks for being a &quot;child killer&quot;, after wrongly being found guilty. He died of a massive heart attack 20 months after he was fully released. The real murderer was eventually convicted in 2007. Waddington was a strong supporter of Capital Punishment.

==Political career==
Waddington stood for election several times before being successful. He was the Conservative candidate at Farnworth in the 1955 general election, at Nelson and Colne in 1964, and at Heywood and Royton in 1966.

He was first elected to Parliament at the 1968 Nelson and Colne by-election, caused by the death of Labour MP Sydney Silverman. He was re-elected there in 1970 and in February 1974, but lost his seat at the October 1974 general election by a margin of 669 votes to Labour&#x27;s Doug Hoyle.

Waddington was returned to Parliament for Clitheroe at a by-election in March 1979, and was subsequently elected for the broadly similar Ribble Valley constituency in 1983.

===In government===
A junior minister under Margaret Thatcher, Waddington was a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury and Government Whip (1979–81), Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of Employment (1981–83), Minister of State at the Home Office (1983–87), and Chief Whip from 1987 until his elevation to Cabinet level in 1989, when he became Home Secretary. On Monday 5 November 1990, he was the guest-of-honour at the annual dinner of the Conservative Monday Club

===Life peer===
On 4 December 1990, he was created a life peer as Baron Waddington, of Read in the County of Lancashire. He served as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords until 1992. He then served as Governor of Bermuda from 1992 until 1997.

Lord Waddington was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in 1994. In 2008, his amendment to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, known as the Waddington Amendment, inserted a freedom of speech clause into new anti-homophobic hate crime legislation.

In November 2009, the Government failed to repeal the Waddington Amendment in the Coroners and Justice Bill. On 26 March 2015, Lord Waddington retired from the House of Lords pursuant to Section 1 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014.

==Personal life==
Waddington married Gillian Rosemary Green (born 1939), the daughter of Alan Green, on 20 December 1958. The couple had three sons and two daughters.

Lord Waddington died of pneumonia on 23 February 2017, at his home in South Cheriton, Somerset, aged 87.
