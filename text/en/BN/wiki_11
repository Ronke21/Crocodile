<text>Minot State University (MSU or MiSU) is a public university in Minot, North Dakota. Founded in 1913 as a normal school, MSU evolved into a university in 1987 and is currently the state&#x27;s third-largest, offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

Four schools comprise the university&#x27;s academic offering. Nine master&#x27;s degrees and one education specialist degree are offered in areas such as communication disorders, management, and mathematics. A mix of liberal arts and professional programs offers more than 60 majors at the undergraduate level. MSU is a North Dakota University System member.

Minot State&#x27;s mascot is the beaver, the school colors are red and green (though Maroon has been used at times in the past), and the campus newspaper is the &quot;Red and Green&quot;. The MSU campus is at the base of Minot&#x27;s North Hill, just west of Broadway (U.S. Route 83).

==History==
MSU was established as a two-year normal school devoted to preparing teachers for service in northwestern North Dakota. In 1924, the Normal School at Minot began issuing baccalaureate degrees, necessitating a name change to Minot State Teacher&#x27;s College. Over time, the range of academic offerings expanded; as a result, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Minot State College in 1964. The school officially attained university status in 1987 and was rebranded to its current name.

==Academics==
The university awards undergraduate degrees in more than 60 courses of study and graduate degrees in 10 fields of study.

Dr. Gordon B. Olson came to Minot State University during the summer of 1967 and led the university through growth and change. In 1967, enrollment was slightly more than 2,000. During Dr. Olson&#x27;s tenure, MSU added many undergraduate and graduate programs. New undergraduate degrees included nursing, social work, and criminal justice. Graduate programs expanded from only one in 1967 to 13. Each of these programs addresses societal needs and the needs of students who pursue careers in these fields.

<text>Otterton Water Mill is at the village of Otterton, near Budleigh Salterton in Devon, England.

Otterton Water Mill is set beside the River Otter in Devon. A watermill was recorded in this locality in Domesday Book in 1086. The mill possessed three pairs of stones. The manor and its mill were given by King Henry V to the nuns of Syon Abbey. At the Dissolution the manor was sold to Richard Duke, in whose family&#x27;s possession the mill remained for 200 years. Sold again in 1785 to Denys Rolle, the estate and the mill subsequently passed through marriage to the Clinton family, who still own the mill as part of the Clinton Devon Estates.
Milling stopped in 1959 and the buildings were subsequently used for grain storage. The watermill was restored in 1977 by Desna Greenhow, and has been operated again since, remaining functional today. Beside the mill is a bakery, a shop, a restaurant and a gallery of art and crafts.

The mill hosts a yearly event with a &quot;Portable Antiquities team&quot; to examine archaeological finds made in the area.

<text>Wellesbourne Watermill is a fine historic flour mill near Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, England on a domesday site. Situated on the River Dene, the mill is a Grade II listed building and is described as &quot;A very complete example of a mill and mill house&quot;.

==History==
Formerly known as Byford Mill, it was rebuilt in 1834. It ran commercially until 1958, latterly using a belt drive from a traction engine, the wheel last being used in 1939. The mill office door carries a date 1785 which formerly belonged to a post mill which stood in the adjacent field. The mill house is 18th century, thus considerably older than the present mill building.

In 1988 the watermill was restored to working order by the Hamilton family, predominantly Sir Andrew Hamilton, with millwright David Nicholls and the Chiltern Partnership, and is still owned by the Walton Estate. It is not currently open to the public. The adjacent mill house is now a private dwelling.

==Machinery==

The internal wheel is breastshot and is unusual in that it carries three sets of clasp arms around the timber axle. It measures diameter and wide. An iron pit wheel is driven off the wheel axle and meshes with an iron wallower of . The spur wheel measures and drives two stone nuts of diameter.

<doc id="428831" wikidata="Q870519" url="?curid=428831" title="Swiss Mennonite Conference">
<text>The Swiss Mennonite Conference (also Konferenz der Mennoniten der Schweiz or Conférence Mennonite Suisse) is an Anabaptist Christian body in Switzerland.

The Swiss Mennonites are the oldest and were possibly the most influential body of Anabaptists at some time. The earliest recorded Anabaptist movement during Reformation times originated in the village of Zollikon near Zürich in 1525. Conrad Grebel (ca. 1496–1526) and Felix Manz (ca. 1496–1527), followers of Huldrych Zwingli, divided from Zwingli on the issue of infant baptism versus believers baptism. They organized in the home of Manz on January 21, 1525. Though Grebel and Manz were dead within two years—Grebel of the plague and Manz drowned by the Council of Zürich—the believers&#x27; baptism movement quickly spread through German-speaking Switzerland. On the day of Manz&#x27; execution, another leader, George Blaurock, was beaten and expelled from the city. From there, he travelled to Bern and eventually left Switzerland, never to return. Bern became the center for Anabaptism in Switzerland.

The movement spread, both by evangelistic zeal and persecution, from Switzerland into Germany, Moravia, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, and eventually to North and South America. Around 1671, because of persecution by the government and the state church, a large group of Anabaptists (Mennonites) left Switzerland for the Palatinate in Germany. For many Mennonites, persecution helped institutionalize separation, non-conformity and farming as a way of life. The Amish schism of the Mennonites originated with Jacob Amman in Switzerland. Many Amish Mennonites in America can be traced to the areas of Thun and Schwarzenburg in Canton Bern.

Records of the conferences of the Swiss Mennonites have been consistently recorded since 1889, but various records indicate that an annual conference was an &quot;old custom&quot; in the 18th century. In 1898 a constitution and the name &quot;Conference of the Mennonites in Switzerland&quot; was adopted.

The &quot;Swiss Mennonite Conference&quot; is a member of the &quot;Federation of Free Churches in Switzerland&quot; and the Mennonite World Conference. In 2003 the conference had 2500 members in 14 congregations.

The congregations range in size from 40 to 500. Each church is autonomous and there is much diversity within the conference. A congregation formed in 1991 is the most recent addition to the body. Though the Swiss conference is currently a relatively small body, the Swiss Mennonites have contributed greatly to the spread of Anabaptism across the world.

<text>Mill Green Museum is a working watermill in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England.
The building is listed grade II* (&quot;The Old Mill House Museum and Mill Green Mill&quot;) and dates from the 17th century. 
The local museum is in the old miller&#x27;s house. Three galleries show changing displays of art and local history.

==History==
The mill uses the power of the River Lea. The Domesday Book records several mills at Hatfield, and they are assumed to have included one at this site and another upstream at Lemsford. 

In 1911 the last miller to mill commercially, Mr Lawrence, emigrated to Australia. However, the mill has been restored to full working order with 18th and 19th century wooden machinery. It is in regular use to grind organic wheat for a local bakery and for retail sale on the premises.

==Access==
The mill is managed by Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council. Visitors can explore the mill, see it working and chat to the miller on duty. Mill Green runs craft and baking workshops, children&#x27;s activities and a school visit service.

<doc id="428845" wikidata="Q7865340" url="?curid=428845" title="UNIVAC Solid State">
<text>The UNIVAC Solid State was a magnetic drum-based solid-state computer announced by Sperry Rand in December 1958 as a response to the IBM 650. It was one of the first computers offered for sale to be (nearly) entirely solid-state, using 700 transistors, and 3000 magnetic amplifiers (FERRACTOR) for primary logic, and 20 vacuum tubes largely for power control. It came in two versions, the Solid State 80 (IBM-style 80-column cards) and the Solid State 90 (Remington-Rand 90-column cards). In addition to the &quot;80/90&quot; designation, there were two variants of the Solid State the SS I 80/90 and the SS II 80/90. The SS II series included two enhancements the addition of 1,280 words of core memory and support for magnetic tape drives. The SS I had only the standard 5,000-word drum memory described in this article and no tape drives.

The memory drum had a regular access speed AREA and a FAST ACCESS AREA. A bank of 4,000 words of memory had one set of read/write (R/W) heads to access. The programmer was required to keep track of what words of memory where under the R/W heads and available to be read or written. At worst the program would have to wait for a full revolution of the drum to access the required memory locations. However 1,000 words of memory had four sets of R/W heads requiring only at most a 90-degree turn of the drum to access the required words.
Programming required that any function that changed the contents of a memory location had first to transfer the contents of the affected word from the drum to a static register.
There were three of these registers A X L, to add the values contained in drum memory locations the programmer would transfer the contents of the specific drum location to register A, then the second operand would be copied to the X register. The ADD instruction would be executed leaving the result in the X register. The contents of the X register would then be written back to the appropriate word on the drum.

Both variants included a card reader, a card punch, and the line printer described in this article. The only &quot;console&quot; was a 10-key adding machine-type keypad, from which the operator would enter the commands to boot the computer. That keypad was also used by programmers in the debugging process. There was no operating system as we have come to know them in recent years; every program was completely self-contained, including the boot loader that initiated execution. All programs were loaded from punched cards; even on the SS II, with its tape drives, there was no ability to launch programs from those drives.

The SS II, including two tape drives, weighed about .

==Architecture==
The UNIVAC Solid State was a two-address, bi-quinary coded decimal computer using signed 10-digit words. Main memory storage was provided by a 5000-word magnetic drum spinning at 17,667 RPM in a helium atmosphere. For efficiency, programmers had to take into account drum latency, the time required for a specific data item, once written, to rotate to where it could be read.

==Technology==
The Solid State was one of the first commercially produced computers to use mostly solid-state components. However, much of the computer&#x27;s logic was made out of magnetic amplifiers, not transistors. The decision to use magnetic amplifiers was made because the point-contact germanium transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The magnetic amplifiers were based on tiny (about 1/8&quot; ID) toroidal stainless steel spools wound with two or so layers of 1/32&quot; wide 4-79 moly-permalloy magnetic material to form magnetic cores. These cores had two windings of #60 copper wire surrounding the 4-79 molypermalloy. 
The magnetic amplifiers required clock pulses of heavy current that could not be produced by the transistors of the day. The system used a clock derived from a timing band recorded on the main storage drum. This signal was read and amplified, processed and sent to the driver tubes, a pair of 6146 power pentode output tubes. The output from these tubes then fed the main clock power amplifier consisting of six 4CX250B metal/ceramic power tetrode tubes running in push-pull/parallel, yielding an output of a kilowatt. The powerful high-voltage signal was stepped down to a 36-volt, high-current clock by oil-filled transformers that were distributed about the machine. The SS80/90 computer could be heard quite clearly in the AM broadcast band at 707 kHz and 1414 kHz. The 4CX250B tetrodes used a grounded plate (anode) due to forced aircooling requirements. This tube is still in demand by amateur radio operators. The clock tube was enclosed in a shielding box that constrained both radio emissions and viewing by eyes of other than Univac&#x27;s field engineers. The power supply output was -1.6 kV for cathode supply and -800 V screen grid supply at 1.8 A capacity. The supply weighed nearly 100 pounds and was mounted at the very top of the power supply stack. Thus the SS 80/90, for the heart of its operation, depended on the very technology it claimed to replace, a marketing tactic.

==Applications==
The computer was a follow on to a computer built for the USAF and delivered to Lawrence G. Hanscom Field, near Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1957. It was manufactured in two versions: the Solid State 80 (IBM-Hollerith 80 column cards) and the Solid State 90 (Remington-Rand 90 column cards). This machine was designated the Solid State 80-90 and sold mostly in Europe. The SS80/90 was aimed at the general purpose business market. UNIVAC SS80/90s were installed at DC Transit, SBA, CWA, in Washington DC during the early sixties.

==Peripherals==
The line printer ran at 600 lines per minute, using a continuously rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character arrived at the printing position, as indicated by timing marks on the end of the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyratron firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically. 

The card punch had a maximum rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite critical throughout the operation of the card punch, the card reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic card punch mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80-column punch card machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical &quot;dog&quot; clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The card punch had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 &quot;points&quot; or &quot;Bull degrees&quot;. 

While the Bull punch was used with the UNIVAC Solid State 80 for 80 column cards the UNIVAC Solid State 90 used the Univac manufactured &quot;Tower Punch&quot; for 90 column cards. The Tower Punch operating at 150 cards per minute used mechanical pin sensing in the pre punch read and the post punch read stations giving the ability to read a card, punch additional information into the card, and check read the results in the post punch station.

<text>Alginite is a component of some types of kerogen alongside amorphous organic matter. Alginite consists of organic-walled marine microfossils, distinct from inorganic (silica)-walled microfossils that comprise diatomaceous earth.

Alginite is a complex soil aggregate of algae based biomass fossil, clay, volcanic ash and calcium carbonate. This material contains a complete spectrum of minerals, biological, macro- and micro-organisms helping to turn lands fertile again in regions where soil has been severely degraded in the past.
At least two forms of alginite are distinguishable, &quot;alginite A&quot; (telalginite) and &quot;alginite B&quot; (lamalginite). The &quot;A&quot; form contains morphologically distinguishable microfossils while the &quot;B&quot; form is more amorphous and film-like.

<doc id="428856" wikidata="Q6028535" url="?curid=428856" title="Inertinite">
<text>Inertinites are a group of partially oxidized organic (mainly plant) materials or fossilized charcoals, all sharing the characteristic that they typically are inert (i.e., not altered) when heated in the absence of oxygen. Inertinite is a common maceral in most types of coal. The main inertinite submacerals are fusinite, semifusinite, micrinite, macrinite, and funginite, with semifusinite being the most common. From the perspective of coal combustion, inertinite can be burned to yield heat but does not yield significant volatile fractions during coking.

Inertinite is also found as tiny flakes within sedimentary rocks. The presence of inertinite in this context is significant in the geological record, as it signifies that wildfires may have occurred at the time that the host sediment was deposited. It can also be an indication of oxidation due to atmospheric exposure or fungal decomposition during deposition.

The optical properties of semifusinite are very similar to those of vitrinite. They differ in that semifusinite displays a folded texture compared to vitrinite, which generally maintains its composed structure. Inertinites also display higher reflectance than vitrinite, except when approaching an anthracitic or graphite state.

Biochar, produced by pyrolysis at temperatures over 600°C, resembles inertinite.

<doc id="428857" wikidata="Q733293" url="?curid=428857" title="SS Great Eastern">
<text>SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was an iron-hulled steamship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and built by John Scott Russell &amp; Co. at Millwall Iron Works on the River Thames, London, England. Powered by both sidewheels and screw propellers, she was by far the largest ship ever built at the time of her 1858 launch, and had the capacity to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia without refuelling. Her length of was surpassed only in 1899 by the 17,274-gross-ton , her gross tonnage of 18,915 was only surpassed in 1901 by the 20,904-gross-ton and her 4,000-passenger capacity was surpassed in 1913 by the 4,234-passenger . The ship having five funnels (which were later reduced to four) was unusual for the time. The vessel also had the largest set of paddle wheels.

Brunel knew her affectionately as the &quot;Great Babe&quot;. He died in 1859 shortly after her maiden voyage, during which she was damaged by an explosion. After repairs, she plied for several years as a passenger liner between Britain and North America before being converted to a cable-laying ship and laying the first lasting transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866. Finishing her life as a floating music hall and advertising hoarding (for the department store Lewis&#x27;s) in Liverpool, she was broken up on Merseyside in 1889.

==History==
===Concept===
After his success in pioneering steam travel to North America with and , Brunel turned his attention to a vessel capable of making longer voyages as far as Australia. With a planned capacity of 15,000 tons of coal, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was envisioned as being able to sail halfway around the world without taking on coal, while also carrying so much cargo and passengers that papers described her as a &quot;floating city&quot; and &quot;the Crystal Palace of the sea&quot;. Brunel saw the ship as being able to effectively monopolize trade with Asia and Australia, making regular trips between Britain and either Trincomalee or Australia.

On 25 March 1852, Brunel made a sketch of a steamship in his diary and wrote beneath it: &quot;Say 600 ft x 65 ft x 30 ft&quot; (180 m x 20 m x 9.1 m). These measurements were six times larger by volume than any ship afloat; such a large vessel would benefit from economies of scale and would be both fast and economical, requiring fewer crew than the equivalent tonnage made up of smaller ships. Brunel realised that the ship would need more than one propulsion system; since twin screws were still very much experimental, he settled on a combination of a single screw and paddle wheels, with auxiliary sail power. Although Brunel had pioneered the screw propeller on a large scale with &quot;Great Britain&quot;, he did not believe that it was possible to build a single propeller and shaft (or, for that matter, a paddleshaft) that could transmit the required power to drive his giant ship at the required speed.

Brunel showed his idea to John Scott Russell, an experienced naval architect and ship builder whom he had first met at the Great Exhibition. Scott Russell examined Brunel&#x27;s plan and made his own calculations as to the ship&#x27;s feasibility. He calculated that it would have a displacement of 20,000 tons and would require to achieve , but believed it was possible. At Scott Russell&#x27;s suggestion, they approached the directors of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company with the new design plan. The James Watt Company would design the ship&#x27;s screw, Professor Piazzi Smyth would design its gyroscopic equipment, and Russell himself would build the hull and paddle wheel.

===1854–1859: Construction to launch===
====Construction====
Brunel entered into a partnership with John Scott Russell, an experienced naval architect and ship builder, to build &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Unknown to Brunel, Russell was in financial difficulties. The two men disagreed on many details. It was Brunel&#x27;s final great project, and he collapsed from a stroke after being photographed on her deck, and died only ten days later, a mere four days after &quot;Great Eastern&quot;″s first sea trials. About the ship, Brunel said &quot;I have never embarked on any one thing to which I have so entirely devoted myself, and to which I have devoted so much time, thought and labour, on the success of which I have staked so much reputation.&quot;

&quot;Great Eastern&quot; was built by Messrs Scott Russell &amp; Co. of Millwall, Middlesex, England, the keel being laid down on 1 May 1854. She was long, wide, with a draught of unloaded and fully laden, and displaced 32,000 tons fully loaded. In comparison, SS &quot;Persia&quot;, launched in 1856, was long with a beam. She was at first named &quot;Leviathan&quot;, but her high building and launching costs ruined the Eastern Steam Navigation Company and so she lay unfinished for a year before being sold to the Great Eastern Ship Company and finally renamed &quot;Great Eastern&quot;.

The hull was an all-iron construction, a double hull of wrought iron in plates with ribs every . Her roughly 30,000 iron plates weighed each, and were cut over individually-made wooden templates before being rolled to the required curvature. Internally the hull was divided by two long, high, longitudinal bulkheads and further transverse bulkheads dividing the ship into nineteen compartments. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was the first ship to incorporate a double-skinned hull, a feature which would not be seen again in a ship for 100 years, but which would later become compulsory for reasons of safety. To maximize her fuel capacity, stored coal was bunkered around and over her 10 boilers; which provided steam at 172 kPa (25 PSI). She had sail, paddle and screw propulsion. The paddle-wheels were in diameter and the four-bladed screw-propeller was across. The power came from four steam engines for the paddles and an additional engine for the propeller. The cylinders for the paddle engines measured bore and stroke. The four cylinders for the screw engine measured bore and stroke. Total power was estimated at . She had six masts (said to be named after the days of a week – Monday being the fore mast and Saturday the spanker mast), providing space for of sails (7 gaff and maximum 9 (usually 4) square sails), rigged similar to a topsail schooner with a main gaff sail (fore-and-aft sail) on each mast, one &quot;jib&quot; on the fore mast and three square sails on masts no. 2 and no. 3 (Tuesday &amp; Wednesday); for a time mast no. 4 was also fitted with 3 yards. In later years, some of the yards were removed. According to some sources she would have carried in sails. Setting sails turned out to be unusable at the same time as the paddles and screw were under steam, because the hot exhaust from the five (later four) funnels would set them on fire. Her maximum speed was . She was involved in a series of accidents during construction, with 6 workers being killed.

====Launch====
&quot;Great Eastern&quot; was planned to be launched on 3 November 1857. The ship&#x27;s massive size posed major logistical issues; according to one source, the ship&#x27;s 19,000 tons (12,000 inert tons during the launch) made it the single heaviest object moved by humans to that point. On 3 November, a large crowd gathered to watch the ship launch, with notables present including the Comte de Paris, the Duke of Aumale, and the Siamese ambassador to Britain. The launch, however, failed, and the ship was stranded on its launch rails – in addition, two men were killed and several others injured, leading some to declare &quot;Great Eastern&quot; an unlucky ship. Brunel rescheduled the launch for January 1858, hoping to use the tide in the next launch attempt.

In the leadup to the second launch, Brunel and &quot;Great Eastern&quot;&#x27;s backers gathered a significant number of chains, jacks, hydraulic rams, and windlasses to assist in launching the ship. Some were obtained from sympathetic engineers, others through returned favours, and yet more for increasing sums of money; so lucrative was renting out of supplies for the ship&#x27;s launch that engineer Richard Tangye was able to found his own engineering firm (Tangye &amp; Co) the next year, remarking that &quot;We launched &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, and she launched us&quot;&quot;.&quot; Advice sent to Brunel on how to launch the ship came from a number of sources, including steamboat captains on the Great Lakes and one admirer who wrote an insightful description on how the massive &quot;Bronze Horseman&quot; had been erected in Saint Petersburg. High winds prevented the ship from being launched on 30 January, but the next morning a fresh attempt successfully launched the ship around 10:00 in the morning.
Following her launch, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; spent a further 8 months being fitted out. However, the cost of the fitting out ($600,000) concerned many investors, who had already spent nearly $6,000,000 constructing her. With the building company already in debt, cost cutting measures were implemented; the ship was removed from Russell&#x27;s shipyard, and many investors requested she be sold. As reported by the &quot;Times&quot;, one investor openly proposed that the ship be sold to the Royal Navy, noting if the navy employed &quot;Great Eastern&quot; as a ram, she would easily cleave through any warship afloat. These efforts had mixed success, with the ship eventually being sold to a new company for £800,000, equating to a loss of $3,000,000 for investors in the Eastern Steam Navigation Company. The new company modified parts of its predecessor&#x27;s design, most notably cutting the ship&#x27;s coal capacity as it intended to use the ship for the American market. Fitting out concluded in August 1859 and was marked with a lavish banquet for visitors (which included engineers, stockholders, members of parliament, 5 earls, and other notables). In early September 1859, the ship sailed from her dock towards the channel, accompanied by many spectators. However, off Hastings she suffered a massive steam explosion (caused by a valve being left shut by accident after a pressure test of the system) that killed five crewmen and destroyed the forwardmost funnel. She proceeded to Portland Bill and then to Holyhead, though some investors claimed more money could have been made if the ship had remained as an &quot;exhibition ship&quot; for tourists in the Thames. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; successfully rode out the infamous Royal Charter Storm, after which it was moved to Southampton for the winter. The start of 1860 led to a further change of ownership when the owning company was found to be badly in debt and the value of the ship depreciated by half. This revelation forced the resignation of the board of directors, who were then replaced by a third group of controlling stockholders.

With the new board in place, the ship was recapitalized to raise an additional $50,000. The new board was determined to finish the ship, but also bet heavily on making large profits exhibiting the ship in North American seaports. To accomplish this, the company played major American and Canadian cities against each other, goading them into competition over which city would welcome &quot;Great Eastern&quot;; the city of Portland, Maine (with additional investment from the Grand Trunk Railway) went so far as to build a $125,000 pier to accommodate the ship. Ultimately New York City – which had quickly dredged a berth for her alongside a lumber wharf – was decided on as the ship&#x27;s first destination.

===1860–1862: Early career===

After some delays, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; began her eleven-day maiden voyage on 17 June 1860 from Liverpool with 35 paying passengers, 8 company &quot;&quot; (passengers who do not pay) and 418 crew. Among the passengers were two journalists, Zerah Colburn and Alexander Lyman Holley. Her first crossing went without incident, and the ship&#x27;s seaworthiness was proven again when she easily survived a small gale. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; arrived in New York on 28 June and was successfully docked, though she did damage part of a wharf. The ship was received with great aplomb, with many vessels and tens of thousands of people crowding to see her. In preparation for the crowds, the crew established a bar on deck, spread sand to soak up tobacco juice, and prepared to receive thousands of visitors. However, relations between the crew and New Yorkers began to sour – the public was outraged by the $1 entry fee (similar excursion trips in New York charged 25 cents) and many would-be visitors decided to forego visiting the ship. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; left New York in late July, taking several hundred passengers on an excursion trip to Cape May and then to Old Point, Virginia. However, this too raised issues as the ship did not have enough provisions (a burst pipe in a storeroom had ruined much of the ship&#x27;s food) to make the short trip comfortable, while the ship&#x27;s rudimentary bathrooms posed a sanitation issue. Duplicate tickets were sold for some berths, families were separated and remixed in improperly assigned cabins, and five plainclothes police officers (put on by New York Police Department to deter pickpockets) were discovered and chased into a livestock pen on deck. After reaching Virginia, the ship steamed back to New York, and from there sailed south again for an excursion cruise in the Chesapeake bay. The ship departed for Annapolis, where it was given 5,000 tons of coal by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; remained in Annapolis for several days, where she was toured by several thousand visitors and President James Buchanan. During the presidential visit, one member of the company board discussed sending the ship to Savannah to transport Southern cotton to English mills, but this idea was never followed up on.

Upon its second return to New York, the company decided to sail from the United States. From a financial perspective, the American venture had been a disaster; the ship had taken in only $120,000 against a $72,000 overhead, whereas the company had expected to take in $700,000. In addition, the company was facing a daily interest payment of $5,000, which ate into any profits the ship made. Hoping to net more profit before returning to Britain, the ship sailed from New York in mid August, bound for Halifax with 100 passengers. However, on approach to the port the ship was hailed by a local lighthouse service, which was empowered by law to collect a toll based on ship tonnage – given the size of the ship, the lighthouse levied a toll of $1,750 on &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Infuriated by the size of the toll, a party went ashore to request that the toll be waived, but the governor of Halifax denied this request. Angered by the refusal, the captain and company leadership ordered the ship to return to Britain immediately, and as such no passengers or visitors were taken on in Halifax.

With the engineering success but financial failure of the 1860 trip, the ship&#x27;s ownership company again attempted to turn &quot;Great Eastern&quot; profitable. During the winter of 1860, Scott Russell (who had recently won a $120,000 legal judgement against the ship company) refitted the ship and repaired damage sustained during its first year of operations; during the refit, she once broke free from her moorings and cut off the bowsprit of HMS &quot;Blenheim&quot;. She departed for New York in May 1861 (her other potential port, Baltimore, now considered too risky due to the outbreak of the American Civil War), arriving in the port with little fanfare. Taking on a cargo of 5,000 tons of barrelled wheat and 194 passengers, she departed for Liverpool on 25 May, making an uneventful trip. Upon her return to Britain, it was announced that the ship&#x27;s company had been contracted by the British War Office to transport 2,000 troops to Canada, part of a show of force to intimidate the rapidly-arming United States. After a further refit to carry troops, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; departed Britain for Quebec City carrying 2,144 soldiers, 473 passengers, and 122 horses; according to one source, this number of passengers – when coupled with &quot;Great Eastern&quot;&#x27;s crew of 400 – marked the most number of people aboard a single ship to that point in history. The voyage was a success and the ship made it to Quebec, where it took two days for the city&#x27;s steamers to ferry the passengers from the ship. The crossing was made in record-setting time, taking 8 days and 6 hours. &quot;Great Eastern&quot;&#x27;s durable design was praised by the military officers aboard, but soon after her return to Britain the War Office discontinued the contract, and the ship returned to regular passenger service.

In September 1861, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was caught in a major hurricane two days out of Liverpool. The ship was trapped in the storm for three days and suffered major damage to her propulsion systems; both her paddle wheels were torn off, her sails stripped away, and her rudder had been bent to 200 degrees and subsequently torn up by the ship&#x27;s single propeller. A jury-rigged propeller was installed by Hamilton Towle (an American engineer returning from Austria), allowing the ship to steer for Ireland powered only by her screw. Arriving in Queenstown, (now Cobh), she was denied entry to the harbour as it was feared high winds would cause her to smash her anchorage; she was granted entry three days later and towed in by HMS &quot;Advice&quot;, tearing the anchor off an American merchant on her way to her berth. The only fatal casualty of the cruise occurred in port when a man was killed by backspin off the helm. Damage caused by the storm and lost revenue from the trip amounted to $300,000.

The ship continued a cycle of uneventful cruises, cargo loadings, and brief exhibitions from late 1861 to mid 1862. By July 1862, the ship was turning its first noteworthy profits, carrying 500 passengers and 8,000 tons of foodstuffs from New York to Liverpool, bringing in $225,000 in gross and requiring a turnaround of only 11 days. However, as noted by sources, the ship&#x27;s owners struggled to sustain this profitability as they were heavily focused on upper and middle class passenger service. As such, the ship was not used to transport large groups of immigrants travelling to the United States, nor did it take full advantage of the major downturn in the American clipper industry during the American Civil War.

===1862–1884: Later career===

====&quot;Great Eastern&quot; Rock incident====

On 17 August 1862, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; departed from Liverpool for New York, carrying 820 passengers and several thousand tons of cargo – given the size of her load, she was drawing of water. After outrunning a small squall, the ship approached the New York coast on the night of 27 August. Fearing that &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was resting too low in the water to pass by Sandy Hook, the ship&#x27;s captain instead chose the nominally safer route through Long Island Sound. While passing by Montauk Point around 2:00 AM, the ship collided with an uncharted rock needle (later named Great Eastern Rock) that stood around below the surface. The rock punctured the outer hull of the ship, leaving a gash wide and longit was later calculated that the needle was large enough to contact the inner hull, but that the outer hull and strong transverse braces had prevented the inner hull from being breached. The collision was noticed by the crew, who guessed that the ship had struck a shifting sand shoal, and after a bilge check &quot;Great Eastern&quot; continued onto New York without incident. While in port, however, it was noticed that the ship had acquired a slight list to starboard, and so a diver was sent in to inspect the hull. After several days of inspection, the diver reported the large hole in the ship&#x27;s outer hull, a major issue as no drydock in the world could fit the ship. The ship&#x27;s hull was repaired by metalworkers in a cofferdam, but cost the company $350,000 and delayed the ship&#x27;s return to Britain by several months. She would make one more trip to New York and back in 1863 before being laid up until 1864 due to her operating costs.

In January 1864, it was announced that the ship would be auctioned off. During the auction, four members of the company board of directors bid $125,000 for the ship and won it, thus acquiring personal control of the vessel. The group then allowed the ship company to go bankrupt, thus separating the ship from the now defunct shipping company and divesting many smaller stockholders. The ship was then contracted out to Cyrus West Field, an American financier, who intended to use it to lay underwater cables. The ship&#x27;s owners developed a business model whereby they would rent out &quot;Great Eastern&quot; as a cable layer in exchange for shares in cable companies, ensuring that if &quot;Great Eastern&quot; succeeded in laying cables, the unprofitable ship could be personally lucrative for her owners.

====Cable laying====
In May 1865, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; steamed to Sheerness to take on wire for the laying of the Transatlantic telegraph cable. In return for using the ship, her owners wanted $250,000 in telegraph company stock, but only on the condition the wire laying succeeded. To accommodate the of cable she was carrying, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; had some of her salons and rooms replaced with large tanks to hold the cable. In July the ship began laying the undersea cable near Valentia Island, gradually working her way west at a speed of . The effort went relatively smoothly for several weeks, but the cable end was lost mid-Atlantic in an accident, forcing the ship to return in 1866 with a new line. The ship&#x27;s first officer, Robert Halpin, managed to locate the lost cable end and the unbroken cable made it to shore in Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland on 27 July 1866.

Halpin became captain of &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, with the ship laying further cables. In early 1869 she laid a series of undersea cables near Brest. Later that year she was outfitted to lay undersea cables in the Indian Ocean; most of the operation&#x27;s expenses were covered by the British government and banks in India, which hoped to circumvent the unreliable overland cables linking Britain to India. In preparation for operations in the hot climate, the ship was painted white to deflect heat away from the ship&#x27;s cable tanks. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; departed from Britain in December 1869, arriving in Bombay (now Mumbai) 83 days later to lay her first cable anchor. Upon her arrival in port, &quot;Great Eastern&quot;&#x27;s size generated considerable public interest, with the captain offering tickets to view the ship for 2 rupees apiece, distributing proceeds to the crew. Departing from Bombay before the onset of the Monsoon season, she proceeded north to lay a cable between Bombay and Aden. From Aden, she laid another cable to the island of Jabal al-Tair, where a second ship rendezvoused with her to take up the cable to Suez and then on to Alexandria.

====Suez Canal concerns====
The Suez Canal, which opened in 1869, was a setback for the ship, as at the time the channel was too shallow for &quot;Great Eastern&quot; to navigate. Going around Africa it would not be able to compete with ships that could use the canal. Ali Rischdi, a famed Arab navigator, proposed taking the ship through the canal, but this was never attempted.

===1885–1890: Break up===

At the end of her cable-laying career – hastened by the launch of the CS &quot;Faraday&quot;, a ship purpose-built for cable laying – she was refitted as a liner, but once again efforts to make her a commercial success failed. She remained moored in Milford Harbour for some time, annoying the Milford harbour board, which wanted to build dockyards in the area. Many proposals for the ship were raised; according to one source, pubs were full of talk of filling her with gunpowder and blowing her up. The ship was ultimately saved, however, as a dock engineer (Frederick Appleby) was able to build a dock around her, using the ship&#x27;s massive hulk as a station for driving pylons. During her 11 years moored in Milford, she accrued a large amount of biofouling on her hull. Early marine naturalist Henry Lee (best known at the time for his skepticism towards sea monsters) conducted an extensive study of her hull, calculating she had ~300 tons of marine life attached to her. She was sold at auction, at Lloyd&#x27;s on 4 November 1885, by order of the Court of Chancery. Bidding commenced at £10,000, rising to £26,200 and sold to Mr Mattos, a city merchant.

Sold again, she was used as a showboat, a floating palace/concert hall and gymnasium. She later acted as an advertising hoardingsailing up and down the Mersey for Lewis&#x27;s Department Store, who at this point were her owners, before being sold. The idea was to attract people to the store by using her as a floating visitor attraction. In 1886 she was sailed to Liverpool for the Liverpool Exhibition of 1886 – during the transit, she struck and badly damaged one of her tugs, the last of 10 ships she would damage or sink. On 10 May 1887, the steamship &quot;G. E. Wood&quot; collided with her in the Mersey. Sold again after the exhibition, one company considered using her to raise shallow shipwrecks, while one humorist suggested that &quot;Great Eastern&quot; be used to help dig the Panama canal by ramming her into the isthmus. She was, again, sold at auction in 1888, fetching £16,000 for her value as scrap. Many pieces of the ship were bought by private collectors, former passengers, and friends of the crew – various fixtures, lamps, furniture, paneling, and other artifacts were kept. Parts of &quot;Great Eastern&quot; were repurposed for other uses; one ferry company converted her wood paneling into a public house bar, while one mistress at a Lancashire boarding school acquired the ship&#x27;s deck caboose for use as a children&#x27;s playhouse.

An early example of breaking-up a structure by use of a wrecking ball, she was scrapped near the Sloyne, at New Ferry on the River Mersey by Henry Bath &amp; Son Ltd in 1889–1890—it took 18 months to take her apart, with her double hull being particularly difficult to salvage. The breaking of the ship caused a minor labour dispute as workers – who were paid by the ton of ship scrapped – became frustrated with the slow pace of breaking and went on strike.

====Trapped worker legend====
After &quot;Great Eastern&quot;&#x27;s scrapping, rumours spread that the shipbreakers had found the remains of trapped worker(s) entombed in her double hull—likely inspired by tales spread by her crew of a phantom riveter who had been sealed in the ship&#x27;s hull. The legend was first widely noted on by James Dugan in 1952, who quoted a letter from a Captain David Duff, and many later sources cite Dugan&#x27;s work. Other authors, notably L. T. C. Rolt in his biography of Brunel, have dismissed the claim (noting such a discovery would have been recorded in company logs and received press attention), but the legend has become widely mentioned in books and articles about nautical ghost stories. In &quot;London and Londoners in the Eighteen-Fifties and Sixties&quot;, Alfred Rosling Bennett writes about the skeleton that &quot;it was then remembered that while on the stocks building a pay-clerk had disappeared with a large sum of money... and was supposed to have fled with it&quot;, and questions if the remains could have been deposited by workmen who had murdered the man. Brian Dunning wrote about the legend in 2020, noting that while it was technically impossible to prove or disprove, the incident could not have happened given the lack of evidence being found during the numerous times &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was being repaired.

====Surviving parts====

Football historian Stephen Kelly states that in 1928, Liverpool Football Club were looking for a flagpole for their Anfield ground, and consequently purchased her top mast. However, further investigation by local journalist Simon Weedy has shown that the mast was originally moved there by Everton F.C., prior to their departure from Anfield in 1892. It still stands there today at the Kop end. In 2011, the Channel 4 programme &quot;Time Team&quot; found geophysical survey evidence to suggest that residual iron parts from the ship&#x27;s keel and lower structure still reside in the foreshore.

During 1859, when &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was off Portland conducting trials, an explosion aboard blew off one of the funnels. The funnel was salvaged and subsequently purchased by the water company supplying Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in Dorset, UK, and used as a filtering device. It was later transferred to the Bristol Maritime Museum close to Brunel&#x27;s SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; then moved to the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; Museum.

In October 2007, the recovery of a anchor in of water about from Great Eastern Rock stirred speculation that it may have belonged to &quot;Great Eastern&quot;.

<doc id="428858" wikidata="Q426999" url="?curid=428858" title="Frances Bean Cobain">
<text>Frances Bean Cobain (born August 18, 1992) is an American visual artist and model. She is the only child of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and Hole frontwoman Courtney Love. She controls the publicity rights to her father&#x27;s name and image.

== Early life ==
Frances Bean Cobain was born on August 18, 1992, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. She was named after Frances McKee, the guitarist for the Scottish indie pop duo The Vaselines, not actress Frances Farmer, as has been commonly assumed. Former R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe and actress Drew Barrymore are her godparents.

Cobain&#x27;s sonogram photo – the origin of her middle name, as her father thought she looked like a kidney bean – was featured on the sleeve of Nirvana&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Lithium&quot;.

Before Cobain&#x27;s birth, rumors suggested that her mother used heroin during the pregnancy. This scandal intensified when &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published Lynn Hirschberg&#x27;s article &quot;Strange Love&quot;, which alleged that Love admitted to using heroin even after learning of her pregnancy. Love and Kurt Cobain maintained that &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; took her words out of context. Eventually, child welfare services launched an investigation into their parenting abilities. The investigation was ultimately dismissed, but not without a significant amount of legal wrangling and Cobain being removed from her parents&#x27; custody for a short time, beginning when she was just two weeks old.

On April 1, 1994, when she was 20 months old, Cobain visited her father at the Exodus Recovery Center, a rehab center in Marina del Rey, California, where they played together. This was the last time she saw her father alive; one week later, he was found dead at his home in Seattle. Cobain was subsequently raised by her mother, aunts, and paternal grandmother. She spent her early years in Seattle and Los Angeles, and was placed in her grandmother&#x27;s care for a time after her mother&#x27;s drug-related arrest in October 2003. Love regained custody of Cobain in 2005. Cobain is a childhood neighbor and close friend of Billie Lourd, daughter of Carrie Fisher and Bryan Lourd.

During her young adulthood, Cobain attended Bard College, where she studied art.

== Career ==
=== Modeling ===
In August 2006, she was photographed for &quot;Elle&quot; UK magazine in her father&#x27;s famous brown cardigan and pajama pants as part of an article featuring children of rock stars in their parents&#x27; clothing. She explained, &quot;I wore his pajamas because he got married in them to my mom in 1992 in Hawaii so I thought they would be cute if I wore them today. He was too lazy to put on a tux so he got married in pajamas!&quot; In February 2008, she appeared in a photo spread for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; dressed as Evita. Cobain modeled for Hedi Slimane for a web photo series released August 2, 2011. In 2016, she modeled alongside Alice Glass in a spread for &quot;Schön!&quot; magazine shot by Floria Sigismondi. In 2017, she was announced as the face of Marc Jacobs&#x27;s Spring/Summer campaign for that year, shot by David Sims.

=== Artwork ===
In July 2010, Cobain debuted a collection of artwork titled &quot;Scumfuck&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Fiddle Tim&quot; at the La Luz de Jesus Gallery in Los Angeles. On August 4, 2012, she participated in the group show &#x27;MiXTAPE&#x27; under her real name. Artists were asked to pick a song and create art inspired by that song. Cobain chose the song &quot;Black&quot; by The Jesus and Mary Chain. The eclectic mix of songs chosen was featured for digital download on iTunes. Opening on June 7, 2017, through June 30, Cobain and artist Lindsey Way held a joint art exhibition titled &quot;Ghosts For Sale&quot; at Gallery 30 South in Pasadena.

=== Other ventures ===
According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, the title and cover photograph for the 2005 Nirvana rarities album &quot;&quot; were chosen by 13-year-old Cobain. Cobain worked as an intern for Rolling Stone magazine from June to August 2008. She was featured in the magazine years later, photographed by David LaChapelle. In 2009, it was reported that Cobain had turned down the role of Alice in Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, while in 2013 it was revealed she had turned down the part of Bella Swan in &quot;Twilight&quot;.

Cobain appeared as a guest vocalist on the song &quot;My Space&quot; from the album &quot;Evelyn Evelyn&quot; by Evelyn Evelyn, which was released on March 30, 2010. Amanda Palmer from Evelyn clarified that Cobain was one of some 20 artists who sang the same line and whose voices were mixed together in the recording. Cobain was also an executive producer on the HBO movie about her father&#x27;s life, &quot;Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck&quot;, though she later denounced the film, calling the representation of her father &quot;not what I wanted it to be&quot;. In 2019, she appeared as a special guest judge in one episode of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; season 4.

== Personal life ==
In September 2005, 13-year-old Cobain gave her first interview to &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, in which she discussed her personal style and mentioned her parents.

On December 11, 2009, a California Superior Court in Los Angeles appointed Wendy O&#x27;Connor, her paternal grandmother, and Kimberly Cobain, her father&#x27;s sister, as Cobain&#x27;s temporary co-guardians. On December 16, 2009, a judge issued a related temporary restraining order prohibiting Love from having any direct or indirect contact with her daughter. The papers were filed under the heading &quot;motion to seal all documents... relating to a minor and allegations of domestic violence&quot;. Among those documents are Cobain&#x27;s medical records, according to the filing.

On August 18, 2010, Cobain inherited 37% of her late father&#x27;s estate. She controls the publicity rights to her father&#x27;s name and image, instead of her mother. During Cobain&#x27;s divorce proceedings from Isaiah Silva, it was revealed she earned, from July 2016 until June 2017, $95,496 per month from the royalties related to her father&#x27;s estate in addition to $6,784 per month in dividends ($102,280 total per month, $1.2 million per year). Her net worth was estimated at $11.3 million. Her father&#x27;s estate was valued in 2014 as being worth $450 million. 

Cobain was ill on April 10, 2014 and therefore could not attend the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony for her father&#x27;s band, Nirvana. Several of her family members - Courtney Love, Wendy O&#x27;Connor, Kimberley Cobain and Brianne O&#x27;Conner (Kurt&#x27;s half-sister) - came on stage at the event. Her godparent, Michael Stipe, gave the band&#x27;s induction speech. 

On September 30, 2017, Cobain was involved in a near death incident when the wing of a plane she was traveling on caught fire, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. 

On February 13, 2018 she announced that she was celebrating two years of being sober. She wrote “The fact that I’m sober isn’t really public knowledge, decidedly and deliberately. But I think it’s more important to put aside my fear about being judged or misunderstood or typecast as one specific thing.” 

On her 30th birthday, August 18, 2022, she wrote on Instagram she was glad to get to that age because as a 20 year old she did not know if she would make it. She mentioned the near death experience in a plane had helped her to embrace a &quot;radical gratitude&quot; at being alive.

Cobain has said she is not a fan of grunge bands, instead preferring the music of artists such as Oasis, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and Mercury Rev, but she has said she likes the Nirvana songs &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; and &quot;Dumb&quot;.

Cobain, along with Wendy O&#x27;Connor and Kim Cobain (Kurt&#x27;s mother and sister, respectively), attended the opening of &quot;Growing Up Kurt Cobain&quot; at the Museum of Style Icons in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland on July 17, 2018. At the exhibition, Cobain said she often uses the phrase, &#x27;peace, love, empathy&#x27;, which her father used in his suicide note, because she wants to &quot;reclaim the peace, love, empathy thing as something that&#x27;s meant for health and for compassion and for true peace, love, and empathy.&quot;

=== Marriages ===
Cobain married The Eeries&#x27; lead singer Isaiah Silva on June 29, 2014, though the wedding date was widely misreported as September 2015. By March 23, 2016, she had filed for divorce, which was finalized on November 30, 2017.

In 2021, Cobain began dating skateboarder Riley Hawk, son of Tony Hawk. They married in Los Angeles on October 7, 2023, with R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe (Cobain&#x27;s godfather) officiating the ceremony. The couple welcomed their first child together, a son, Ronin Walker Cobain Hawk, on September 17, 2024.

<doc id="428860" wikidata="Q1237331" url="?curid=428860" title="Maceral">
<text>A maceral is a component, organic in origin, of coal or oil shale. The term &#x27;maceral&#x27; in reference to coal is analogous to the use of the term &#x27;mineral&#x27; in reference to igneous or metamorphic rocks. Examples of macerals are inertinite, vitrinite, and liptinite.

== Inertinite ==
Inertinite is considered to be the equivalent of charcoal and degraded plant material. It is highly oxidised in nature and may be said to be burnt. A large portion of South Africa&#x27;s coal reserves consist of inertinite.

== Vitrinite ==
Vitrinite is shiny, glass-like material that is considered to be composed of cellular plant material such as roots, bark, plant stems and tree trunks. Vitrinite macerals when observed under the microscope show a boxlike, cellular structure, often with oblong voids and cavities which are likely the remains of plant stems. This has a high calorific value (24 - 28 MJ/kg) and a large proportion of volatile matter (24 - 30%). It often occurs interbanded or interlaminated with inertinite and can be recognised as bright bands.

== Liptinite ==
Liptinite macerals are considered to be produced from decayed leaf matter, spores, pollen and algal matter. Resins and plant waxes can also be part of liptinite macerals. Liptinite macerals tend to retain their original plant form, i.e., they resemble plant fossils. These are hydrogen rich and have the highest calorific values of all coal macerals.

Macerals of liptinite are sporinite, cutinite, resinite, alginite (telalginite and lamalginite), liptodetrinite, fluorinite, and bituminite.

==Nature of macerals==

Macerals are considered to be dehydrogenated plant fragments. Evidence for this includes remnant pollen spores, fossilised leaves, remnant cellular structure and similar. In rare cases, maceral and fossilised pollen can be found in terrestrial sedimentary rocks.

Maceral maturity can be estimated by &quot;vitrinite reflectance&quot;. This gives information on the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen composition of the coal, and determines the type of coal: lignite, bituminous coal, or anthracite.

Macerals found in kerogen source rocks are often observed under the microscope to determine the kerogen maturity of the sedimentary formations. This is a vital component of oil and gas exploration.

Macerals are observed under the petrographic microscope under reflected light. Coal fragments must be extremely highly polished down to less than half a micrometre before they can be observed under the microscope.

<doc id="428865" wikidata="Q2287863" url="?curid=428865" title="Ironic (song)">
<text>&quot;Ironic&quot; is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released in February 1996 by Maverick and Warner Bros. as the third single from her third studio album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995). It was written by Morissette and Glen Ballard, and was produced by him. The lyrics present several unfortunate situations that are described as &quot;ironic&quot;; this has led to debate as to whether any of these match the accepted meaning of irony.

For six weeks, the track topped the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart, eventually becoming the second-most-successful song of the year in the country. It also reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand, and Norway. In the United States, the song reached number four on April 13, 1996, and since then it has been her highest-charting single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Ironic&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song won the Juno Award for Single of the Year, and received two Grammy Award nominations in 1997, for Record of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video. French director Stéphane Sednaoui filmed the music video. In it, Morissette drives through a winter landscape, and she plays multiple roles as her passengers. MTV nominated the music video for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, winning three of them. The music video was listed on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Music Videos&quot; list and was parodied by DBA Flip, Allison Rheaume, Rusty and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.

&quot;Ironic&quot; was included on the set list of Morissette&#x27;s Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995), and her compilation albums &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1999), &quot;The Collection&quot; (2005), among others. The song was covered by Mexican duet Jesse &amp; Joy for their album &quot;Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones&quot; (2007), and by American band Four Year Strong for their cover album &quot;Explains It All&quot; (2009).

==Writing and composition==

&quot;Ironic&quot; was written by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, and produced by the latter for her third studio album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995). In an interview with Christopher Walsh of &quot;Billboard&quot;, Ballard explained how he and Morissette met, and how &quot;Ironic&quot; was written. He commented: &quot;I&#x27;m telling you, within 15 minutes we were at it—just writing. &#x27;Ironic&#x27; was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were just having fun. I thought &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what this is—what genre it is—who knows? It&#x27;s just good″&quot;. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing, it is set in common time, with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute, and played in the key of B major (with the chorus being based on the F Mixolydian scale). Morissette&#x27;s vocals range from the tone of E4 to A5, and &quot;Ironic&quot; chord progression starts with the sequence of E–F6–E–F6, before changing to F–B–F–Gm7 in the chorus.

===Linguistic dispute===
The song&#x27;s usage of the word &quot;ironic&quot; attracted media attention; according to Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it gives a distinct &quot;unironic&quot; sense in its implications. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;irony&quot; is &quot;a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what was or might be expected; an outcome cruelly, humorously, or strangely at odds with assumptions or expectations&quot;. From a prescriptivist perspective, lyrics such as &quot;It&#x27;s a free ride when you&#x27;ve already paid&quot; and &quot;A traffic jam when you&#x27;re already late&quot; are thus not ironic.

Morissette said: &quot;For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in &#x27;Ironic&#x27; was ironic wasn&#x27;t a traumatic debate. I&#x27;d always embraced the fact that every once in a while I&#x27;d be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic.&quot; In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts wrote a defense of the song for &quot;Salon,&quot; saying that it cites situational ironies: the &quot;state of affairs or event[s] that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often wryly amusing as a result&quot;. Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted time to the discussion of irony in the 2014 episode &quot;Dord&quot;. In this video, Stevens considers the difference between the typically cited &quot;situational&quot; irony, versus &quot;dramatic&quot; irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are: the situations aren&#x27;t ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic.

Comedian Ed Byrne performed a skit in which he jokingly attacked the song for its lack of ironies: &quot;The only ironic thing about that song is it&#x27;s called &#x27;Ironic&#x27; and it&#x27;s written by a woman who doesn&#x27;t know what irony is. That&#x27;s quite ironic.&quot; Satirists Berger and Wyse parodied the song in one segment of their cartoon strip &quot;The Pitchers&quot;. In that episode, a superhero named &quot;Irony Man&quot; compared his superpowers to lyrics from Morissette&#x27;s song, causing his cohorts to rename him &quot;The Man from Alanis&quot;. In December 2009, the comedy website &quot;CollegeHumor&quot; released a spoof video of the song called &quot;Actually Ironic&quot;, featuring actress Sarah Natochenny, in which Patrick Cassels amended the lyrics in a form that would be appropriately ironic. For example, &quot;it&#x27;s like rain on your wedding day, to the Egyptian sun god Ra.&quot; The &quot;CollegeHumor&quot; spoof was similarly replicated in July 2013 with a song called, &quot;It&#x27;s Finally Ironic&quot; by sisters Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, from New York City, who published their version on YouTube. The sisters adjusted the lyrics to reflect irony (e.g., &quot;it&#x27;s a black fly in your chardonnay, that was specifically purchased to repel black flies&quot;) and sing the line &quot;We fixed it for you, Alanis. You&#x27;re welcome.&quot; throughout their video. In his 2014 song &quot;Word Crimes&quot;, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic references Morissette&#x27;s lyrics by singing &quot;Irony is not coincidence&quot;, and the music video for the song shows a fire truck burning (depicted as &quot;Irony&quot;) compared with rain during a wedding (which is described as &quot;Weather&quot;). Morissette herself poked fun at her grammar mistakes during a 2013 performance of &quot;Semicolon&quot; with The Lonely Island on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. In it, Morissette cut off their song to explain that their use of hashtag rap to demonstrate the function of a semicolon is incorrect, to which they respond that her critiquing their grammar is &quot;ironic&quot;. Morissette further poked fun at herself in a 2015 performance of an updated version &quot;Ironic&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, in which she added the line &quot;It’s singing &#x27;Ironic&#x27;, when there are no ironies&quot; to the song.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Jaime Gill from Dot Music commented on the original version of &quot;Ironic&quot;, on his review of &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot; (2005), that &quot;[&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;] gave us pop&#x27;s greatest parlour game, with spot the genuine irony in &#x27;Ironic&#x27;&quot; and calling the song &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;catchy&quot;. Additionally, he noted that the acoustic version “actually sounds more relaxed and engaging without the hoary loud guitars of the original&quot;. Even though Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic marked the track as one of the &quot;All Media Guide track pick&quot; of the album, in a separate review, from the same website, the CD single release was rated with two-and-a-half out of five stars. Pareles noted that in verses of &quot;Ironic&quot;, and another song from the album (&quot;Mary Jane&quot;), &quot;it&#x27;s easy to envision Morissette on the stage of a club, singing wry couplets backed by acoustic guitar&quot;. He also commented in another article he wrote, that the song was actually &quot;unironic&quot;. Victoria Segal from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised it as &quot;a perfectly nice piece of bubbling folk rock.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; rated it four out of five, noting that it &quot;builds into another powerful anthem with beautiful echoes of The Cocteau Twins. It could see her break into the Top 20 for the first time.&quot; Dave Brecheisen of &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that the acoustic version of &quot;Ironic&quot;, was much worse than the original version. The single won the Juno Award for Single of the Year at the 1997 ceremony, and in the same year it was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the category of Record of the Year.

===Chart performance===
In Canada, &quot;Ironic&quot; debuted on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks at number 95 on the issue dated January 8, 1996. Twelve weeks later the track topped the chart, on April 1, 1996, staying there for six weeks, being replaced by &quot;Closer to Free&quot; by American band BoDeans. Spending twenty-nine weeks within the top 100, it was last seen on July 22, 1996, at number 81. It spent 14 weeks in the top 10 and was the number-two song of 1996, behind Morissette&#x27;s own &quot;You Learn&quot; at number one. On other &quot;RPM&quot; charts, the single topped the Alternative 30 for a single week, spending 11 weeks in the top 10, finishing 1996 as the number-five song for the year on that chart. It reached number six on the Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.

In the US, the track debuted at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 following its commercial release, becoming the highest debut on the issue ending March 16, 1996. The single eventually reached its peak position, at number four, on April 13, 1996. &quot;Ironic&quot; is currently Morissette&#x27;s highest-charting hit on the Hot 100 chart. On other US charts, the single became her third number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it stayed for three weeks. The song topped the Top 40/Mainstream chart, reached number five on Adult Top 40 and peaked at number 28 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

In Australia, the song debuted at number 40 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In its eighth week, it peaked at number three on May 12, 1996, where it stayed for two weeks. It was last appeared on the chart on July 21, 1996, at number 37. As of , &quot;Ironic&quot; is her best-charting song on the country. In New Zealand, where the song was released as a double A-side with &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, it debuted at number 13 on April 21, 1996, peaked at number three on May 19, and made its last appearance on the chart at number 36 on June 30, staying at total of 11 weeks in the top 50. Like in Australia, &quot;Ironic&quot; became Morissette&#x27;s highest-peaking single in New Zealand, but only at the time; &quot;Thank U&quot; and &quot;Hands Clean&quot; would chart higher in 1998 and 2002, respectively.

The song was generally well-received throughout Europe. In the United Kingdom &quot;Ironic&quot; debuted and peaked at number 11, on April 20, 1996. It left the chart eight weeks later, at number 67. In the Norwegian Singles Charts, it debuted at number 18, rising to number 17 the next week. It rose to number five on its third week, and later peaked at number four, staying there for five weeks. It later dropped one place, and remained there for another two weeks. &quot;Ironic&quot; kept within the chart for seventeen weeks. In Belgium, it reached sixth place on the Ultratop 50 (Flanders region), and ninth place on the Ultratop 50 (Wallonia zone).

===2001 Clear Channel memorandum===
In September 2001, following the September 11 attacks, &quot;Ironic&quot; was included in Clear Channel Communications&#x27;s (now iHeartMedia) list of &quot;lyrically questionable&quot; songs, commonly known as the Clear Channel memorandum. This was presumably due to the song&#x27;s second verse, which tells the story of a man flying in an airplane that crashes.

==Promotion==
===Music video===

The music video for &quot;Ironic&quot; was directed by Stéphane Sednaoui and released on January 23, 1996. In the beginning of the video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile (1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V) with a cup of coffee in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song&#x27;s first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver&#x27;s side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be &quot;ironic&quot; in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her &quot;passengers&quot; have disappeared.

In an interview for &quot;Vogue&quot; in 2015, Morissette revealed that her clothes in the video reflected the personalities of each character. The driver in a red knit beanie was the one in control, &quot;the responsible one&quot;. The spunky character, who Morissette refers to as the “quirkster,” wears a yellow sweater with a crown of long swaying braids. Morissette liked the braids so much that she would often wear them on stage. The passenger-seat girl wearing a deep red sweater and pajama-type pants was &quot;the romantic—wistful and thoughtful and also the risk-taker&quot;. As for the girl head-banging in the backseat in green sweater, Morissette said; &quot;The girl in green feels the most like the &#x27;whole me&#x27;. The green sweater girl—fun and frolic-y. [She] gets into trouble—she&#x27;s the girl you want with you when you are heading to a water park.&quot;

Blaine Allan noted in the book &quot;Television: Critical Methods and Applications&quot; (2002) how Morissette interacts with the watcher. He commented that unlike Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Lucky&quot; music video, where Spears plays dual role of a girl named &quot;Lucky&quot; and her fan, and both appear together in some scenes helped by visual effects, &quot;Ironic&quot; does not utilize them, using solely editing, giving the sense that all the Morissettes interact with each other. Journalist Carol Vernallis also found that Morissette&#x27;s &quot;&quot; way of singing the song creates an intimate connection with the viewer. She mentioned the video in her book &quot;Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context&quot; (2004), where she studied how the audience may pay attention to the lyrics of the song in a music video. Vernallis added that &quot;Ironic&quot; music video functions as a limited example of how the meaning of a song&#x27;s lyrics become &quot;inaccessible&quot; when they are videotaped and televised.

Charles Aaron from &quot;Spin&quot; called &quot;Ironic&quot; music video &quot;neat&quot;. The video was nominated for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996: &quot;Video of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Direction in a Video&quot;, &quot;Viewer&#x27;s Choice&quot;, &quot;Best Female Video&quot;, &quot;Best New Artist in a Video&quot; and &quot;Best Editing&quot;, winning the last three. It was nominated in 1997 for the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. Also, it was listed number eighteen at VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Videos.

In late 1996, a parody version of the video was released featuring a 6-year-old Canadian girl named Allison Rheaume, who mimics Morissette&#x27;s actions and wardrobe while lip syncing to the original song. At the end, her father notices her in the car sitting in the driveway and tells her to stop fooling around. This version of the video, directed by David Rheaume, was played on MTV and was included on Morissette&#x27;s CD/DVD &quot;The Collection&quot; (2005). Also in late 1996, the video was spoofed by Jimmy The Cab Driver during a commercial on MTV. Inglewood, CA rapper DBA Flip parodied the video for his 1996 single &quot;It&#x27;s Friday Night (Just Got Paid)&quot;. At the end of the video, Flip&#x27;s car runs out of gas as he rolls up on an Alanis Morissette lookalike carrying a gas can and wearing one of the jackets from the &quot;You Learn&quot; video.

Canadian band Rusty parodied &quot;Ironic&quot; on the version 2 of the music video for their 1997 single &quot;Empty Cell&quot;. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic produced a parody version of the video in 2003 for his television comedy series &quot;Al TV&quot;, in which he takes the place of the fourth version of Morissette in the front passenger seat. In 2018, Toronto R&amp;B singer Ramriddlz paid tribute to &quot;Ironic&quot; on the music video for his single &quot;Worst Love&quot;.

===Live performances===
The single was added in the set list for Morissette&#x27;s concert tour, Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995). The song was added to the tour&#x27;s video album &quot;Jagged Little Pill Live&quot; (1997). Since then, &quot;Ironic&quot; has been included in her albums &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1999), &quot;Feast on Scraps&quot; (2002), &quot;Live in the Navajo Nation&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Collection&quot;, as well as 1997 Grammys and the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; compilation albums.

With &quot;Ironic&quot;, Morissette denoted her support for same-sex marriage. In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: &quot;It&#x27;s meeting the man of my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband&quot;. She commented to &quot;USA Today&quot; that her support about same-sex unions &quot;goes a step further than clever lyrics.&quot; She remarked that &quot;[her] fantasy would now be to marry some of [her] gay couple friends.&quot; Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, but I would be honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it as a sort of spontaneous thing at a radio station about a month ago with a couple, and my heart was so with them.&quot; Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her &quot;iTunes Originals&quot; release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot;, as well for the compilation album &quot;Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16&quot; (2004). Morissette also performed the song with Avril Lavigne at the House of Blues in 2005.

==Covers and use in media==
In 2003, Ji-In Cho covered the song for the German version of the &quot;Fame Academy&quot; talent show, which became a success in the German charts. &quot;Ironic&quot; was covered in 2007 by Mexican duo Jesse &amp; Joy for their album &quot;Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones&quot;, and the pop punk band Four Year Strong for their 90s cover album &quot;Explains It All&quot; (2009).

In the 1996 novel &quot;Naïve. Super&quot; by Norwegian author Erlend Loe, the protagonist watches the music video for the song on television and dreams about &quot;meeting an Alanis-girl and living in a house together with her&quot;. In a season 4 episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, entitled &quot;Bob and Carol and Lois and Clark&quot;, several characters make joking references to the song not really being about irony at all throughout the episode. In the Jay and Silent Bob comic &quot;Chasing Dogma&quot; (1998), the character Tricia Jones is singing &quot;Ironic&quot; before Jay steps into the shower. The music of the song was featured in the romantic comedy film &quot;I Could Never Be Your Woman&quot; (2007), where Saoirse Ronan, as Izzie Mensforth, sings an altered version of the lyrics in a talent show. It also made a predominant appearance as the opener to 2013 comedy film &quot;The Internship&quot;, starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, as they sing along to it.

In 2015, Morissette appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; and sang a version of the song with new lyrics &quot;updated&quot; for the technology era, and an homage to the linguistics of the original mentioned above.

<text>In coal geology, liptinite is the finely-ground and macerated remains found in coal deposits. It replaced the term exinite as one of the four categories of kerogen. Liptinites were originally formed by spores, pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, leaf cuticles, and plant resins and waxes. 

M.C. Stopes introduced the term &quot;exinite&quot; in 1935 to describe the microscopic constituent of coal, rich in volatiles and relatively rich in hydrogen, that is represented by the exines of spores. C.A. Seyler in 1932, however, used the term with its present meaning, designating the following group of macerals: sporinite, cutinite, alginite (telalginite and lamalginite), resinite. 

Macerals (from the same Latin source as &#x27;macerate&#x27;) are to coal as minerals are to rock. The term was coined by M. C. Stopes in 1935, who wrote
:&quot;The concept behind the word ‘macerals’ is that the complex of biological units represented by a forest tree which crashed into a watery swamp and there partly decomposed and was macerated in the process of coal formation, did not in that process become uniform throughout but still retains delimited regions optically differing under the microscope, which may or may not have different chemical formulae and properties. These organic units, composing the coal mass I propose to call macerals, and they are the descriptive equivalent of the inorganic units composing most rock masses and universally called minerals.&quot;

The macerals grouped under the term &quot;exinite&quot; are not necessarily entirely composed from exines, but appear to have similar technical properties, though little information is so far available on the technological behavior of pure exinite.

<doc id="428871" wikidata="Q745964" url="?curid=428871" title="Château Frontenac">
<text>The Fairmont Le Château Frontenac, commonly referred to as the Château Frontenac, is a historic hotel in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The hotel is situated in Old Quebec, within the historic district&#x27;s Upper Town, on the southern side of Place d&#x27;Armes. The Château Frontenac was designed by Bruce Price, and was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The hotel is managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.

Opened in 1893, the Châteauesque-styled building has 18 floors; its height is augmented by its ground elevation. It is one of the first completed grand railway hotels, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1981. The hotel was expanded on three occasions, with the last major expansion taking place in 1993.

==Location==
The Château Frontenac is situated on 1, rue des Carrières, at the eastern edge of Old Quebec&#x27;s Upper Town, built on the promontory of Quebec, a raised mass of land that projects into the Saint Lawrence River. The hotel property is bounded by rue Saint Louis to the north, and rue Mont Carmel to the south. Terrasse Dufferin is a terrace that wraps around the hotel from the northeast to the southeast, overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. Two public roads run through the hotel, rue du Trésor, and rue des Carrières. The hotel building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, known as the Château Frontenac National Historic Site of Canada. The area was designated as a National Historic Site in January 1981.

Located near the edge of the promontory of Quebec, the Château Frontenac is situated near several major historic attractions within the historic district of Old Quebec&#x27;s Upper Town. To the northeast of the hotel lies the Ursulines Monastery of Quebec, a 17th-century monastery founded by a missionary group of Ursuline nuns, and another National Historic Site of Canada. To the south of the hotel lies the Plains of Abraham, a historic area within The Battlefields Park, and the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Another major attraction south of the hotel is the Citadelle of Quebec, situated at the atop Cap Diamant, an elevated point of the promontory. The Citadelle serves as an active military installation for the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as a secondary official residence for the Canadian monarch and the Governor General of Canada. East of the hotel lies the Terrasse Dufferin, and Old Quebec&#x27;s Lower Town directly below it.

The Château Frontenac was not the first large building on the site. The first one was built during the 1780s, and was known as the Château Haldimand, named after the Governor of Quebec who ordered its construction. It was demolished in 1892 to make way for the present hotel.

==Design==
===Architecture===

The Château Frontenac is one of Canada&#x27;s grand railway hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Châteauesque architectural style used throughout the hotel would later serve as a template for other Canadian grand railway hotels erected in the late-19th to early-20th century. The central fortress-like tower design is derived from medieval châteaux found throughout France&#x27;s Loire Valley. Châteauesque elements include the hotel&#x27;s asymmetrical profile, with steeply pitched roofs, massive circular and polygonal towers and turrets, ornate gables and dormers, and tall chimneys. The exterior base of the hotel is largely made of grey stone ashlar, with steel framing running up the building, Glenboig brick cladding. Materials that make up the interior of the building includes mahogany panelling, marble staircases, carved stone, wrought iron, and glass roundels. However, as opposed to the other Châteauesque-styled buildings found in France, the Château Frontenac did not utilize elements of Italianate architecture, instead placing a greater emphasis on Gothic elements. The hotel also draws certain elements from Victorian style of architecture, with rich polychromatic surfaces throughout its exterior.

Built in 1892–93, the Château Frontenac was originally designed by architect Bruce Price. Price&#x27;s plan called for a horseshoe-shaped hotel, made up of four wings of unequal length, connected at obtuse angles. Public rooms made up the majority of the first two floors of Price&#x27;s designs. The original proposal called for a square structure, however the completion of the Terrasse Dufferin led to the development for a more picturesque building. Since its completion, the hotel has undergone several major expansions and renovations led by several different architects and architectural firms. William Sutherland Maxwell led two major expansions to the hotel, one in 1908–09, and another in 1920–24 (co-led with his brother, Edward Maxwell). Renovations in the 1990s were led by one of Canada&#x27;s most successful firms, Arcop, an architectural firm based in Montreal. The hotel was again expanded in 1993, with the addition of a new wing, which was led by a then young architect who is now one of the most respected architects in the hotel and hospitality business in Canada, Robert LaPierre, Member of the 2011 Fellows – Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.

Access to the hotel&#x27;s main entrance is marked by several porte-cochères with large dormers and a cupola. The porte-cochère leads guests into the hotel&#x27;s central courtyard, as well as the entrance to the hotel&#x27;s main lobby. The building stands , containing 18 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the addition of the tallest tower in 1924, the hotel became the tallest building in Quebec City. It remained the city&#x27;s tallest building until 1930, when the Édifice Price was completed just northwest of the hotel. Although several buildings in Quebec City are taller, the hotel continues to hold a prominent position in the city&#x27;s skyline, as it is perched atop a tall cape overlooking the Saint Lawrence River.

===Facilities===
The Château Frontenac includes 610 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel building. Eight executive suites were renovated into specialty &quot;themed rooms&quot;. Most of the suites are themed to the heads of state and government that have visited the hotel, such as the Trudeau-Trudeau Suite, named after two Canadian Prime Ministers, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and Justin Trudeau. The Churchill Suite and Roosevelt Suite are two suites named after attendees of the First and Second Quebec Conferences, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively. Other suites themed in honour of world leaders include the Charles de Gaulle, named after the former President of France, and the Elizabeth II, named for the former Queen of Canada.

Aside from world leaders, the hotel also offers suites themed to Alfred Hitchcock, a director who filmed much of &quot;I Confess&quot; at the hotel; William Cornelius Van Horne, the second President of the Canadian Pacific Railway; and Celine Dion. The Celine Dion Heritage Suite utilizes an Art Deco style throughout the suite, decorated with images from Dion&#x27;s family photographer.

A number of rooms at the Château Frontenac are also occupied by restaurants and other food-based services. As of 2018, three restaurants operate within the hotel: &quot;1608 Wine and Cheese Bar&quot;, &quot;Bistro Le Sam&quot;, and &quot;Champlain&quot;. As a part of Fairmont Hotels and Resorts&#x27; larger &quot;Bee Sustainable&quot; program, the Château Frontenac hosts four queen honey bees in hives on the hotel&#x27;s rooftop garden. The honey is harvested three times a year and is used by the hotel&#x27;s restaurants. The hotel has nearly 70,000 honey bees producing of honey per year. The hotel&#x27;s rooftop apiary also operates a pollinator hotel.

The Château was the recipient of the 2022 Global Hotel of the Year Award.

==History==
===Background===
In the 1870s, a restoration project began in Quebec under the British governor general of Canada aimed at restoring the capital to its former 17th century look. One of the contributors to this project was Lord Dufferin, who supervised the construction of the old city wall and many public buildings that followed the theme of old, medieval, European Quebec. Dufferin also made a plan to reconstruct the Château Saint-Louis which was located on the cape where the Château Frontenac currently stands and served as the home of the French governors from 1620 to 1834. Dufferin&#x27;s plan did not take off until the City Council and the Board of Trade adopted the idea and planned to instead construct a grand hotel on the site to attract upper-class tourism to the area, but after failing to finance its construction, businessmen from Toronto and Montreal with connections to the Canadian Pacific Railway took control of the project.

===1890s–present===
The Château Frontenac was completed in 1893, and was designed by American architect Bruce Price and overseen by William Van Horne, the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s general manager and a key developer of the Canadian railway hotel system. The hotel was a part of a series of Châteauesque-styled hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last of the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Châteauesque hotels was completed in 1908, leaving the rival company Grand Trunk Railway to continue the trend. The hotel was expanded in 1924 to designs by William Sutherland Maxwell. The 1924 expansion saw the addition of the hotel&#x27;s central tower, which was built by Anglin-Norcross of Montreal. The hotel was named after Louis de Buade, Count of Frontenac, who was the Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682, and again from 1689 to 1698. 

The World War II Allies met there during the First and Second Quebec Conference (in 1943 and 1944 respectively). During these conferences, officials including American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, discussed strategy for World War II.

In 1953, this hotel was used as the filming location for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;I Confess&quot;, featuring Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter.

In 1993, the hotel saw another expansion, with the addition of the new wing that included a pool, fitness centre, and outdoor terrace. On June 14, 1993, Canada Post issued &#x27;Le Château Frontenac, Québec&#x27; designed by Kosta Tsetsekas, based on illustrations by Heather Price. The $C0.43 stamp features an image of the hotel building, and has a perforated edge and is 13.5mm square. Printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

In 2001, the hotel was sold to Legacy REIT, which is partially owned by Fairmont, for $185 million. The hotel was renamed the Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in November 2001, shortly after Canadian Pacific Hotels reformed itself as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, taking the name of an American company it acquired in 2001.

In 2011, the hotel was sold to Ivanhoé Cambridge. Shortly after acquiring the hotel, Ivanhoé Cambridge announced an investment of $9 million for the restoration of the building&#x27;s masonry work, and the replacement of the building&#x27;s copper roofs. The company further announced another $66 million investment for general improvements and renovations throughout the hotel. When the roof was being replaced, an image of the roof was printed on polypropylene safety netting and hung from scaffolding to hide the refurbishing project from view. The extensive renovation saw conference rooms expanded, restaurants remodeled, modernization of the lobby, and the gutting and rebuilding of three-fifths of the hotel&#x27;s rooms. It was used for a location in the television crime drama series &quot;La Faille&quot;″s second season, also known as &quot;The Wall: The Chateau Murder&quot; (2021).

<doc id="428874" wikidata="Q858313" url="?curid=428874" title="Crassulacean acid metabolism">
<text>Crassulacean acid metabolism, also known as CAM photosynthesis, is a carbon fixation pathway that evolved in some plants as an adaptation to arid conditions that allows a plant to photosynthesize during the day, but only exchange gases at night. In a plant using full CAM, the stomata in the leaves remain shut during the day to reduce evapotranspiration, but they open at night to collect carbon dioxide () and allow it to diffuse into the mesophyll cells. The is stored as four-carbon malic acid in vacuoles at night, and then in the daytime, the malate is transported to chloroplasts where it is converted back to , which is then used during photosynthesis. The pre-collected is concentrated around the enzyme RuBisCO, increasing photosynthetic efficiency. This mechanism of acid metabolism was first discovered in plants of the family Crassulaceae.

==Historical background==
Observations relating to CAM were first made by de Saussure in 1804 in his &quot;Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation&quot;. Benjamin Heyne in 1812 noted that &quot;Bryophyllum&quot; leaves in India were acidic in the morning and tasteless by afternoon. These observations were studied further and refined by Aubert, E. in 1892 in his &quot;Recherches physiologiques sur les plantes grasses&quot; and expounded upon by Richards, H. M. 1915 in &quot;Acidity and Gas Interchange in Cacti&quot;, Carnegie Institution. The term CAM may have been coined by Ranson and Thomas in 1940, but they were not the first to discover this cycle. It was observed by the botanists Ranson and Thomas, in the succulent family Crassulaceae (which includes jade plants and &quot;Sedum&quot;). The name &quot;Crassulacean acid metabolism&quot; refers to acid metabolism in Crassulaceae, and not the metabolism of &quot;crassulacean acid&quot;; there is no chemical by that name.

==Overview: a two-part cycle==

CAM is an adaptation for increased efficiency in the use of water, and so is typically found in plants growing in arid conditions. (CAM is found in over 99% of the known 1700 species of &quot;Cactaceae&quot; and in nearly all of the cacti producing edible fruits.)

===During the night===
During the night, a plant employing CAM has its stomata open, allowing to enter and be fixed as organic acids by a PEP reaction similar to the pathway. The resulting organic acids are stored in vacuoles for later use, as the Calvin cycle cannot operate without ATP and NADPH, products of light-dependent reactions that do not take place at night.
===During the day===
During the day, the stomata close to conserve water, and the -storing organic acids are released from the vacuoles of the mesophyll cells. An enzyme in the stroma of chloroplasts releases the , which enters into the Calvin cycle so that photosynthesis may take place.

===Benefits===
The most important benefit of CAM to the plant is the ability to leave most leaf stomata closed during the day. Plants employing CAM are most common in arid environments, where water is scarce. Being able to keep stomata closed during the hottest and driest part of the day reduces the loss of water through evapotranspiration, allowing such plants to grow in environments that would otherwise be far too dry. Plants using only carbon fixation, for example, lose 97% of the water they take up through the roots to transpiration - a high cost avoided by plants able to employ CAM.

===Comparison with metabolism=== 
The pathway bears resemblance to CAM; both act to concentrate around RuBisCO, thereby increasing its efficiency. CAM concentrates it temporally, providing during the day, and not at night, when respiration is the dominant reaction. plants, in contrast, concentrate spatially, with a RuBisCO reaction centre in a &quot;bundle sheath cell&quot; being inundated with . Due to the inactivity required by the CAM mechanism, carbon fixation has a greater efficiency in terms of PGA synthesis.

There are some /CAM intermediate species, such as &quot;Peperomia camptotricha&quot;, &quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;, and Portulaca grandiflora. It was previously thought that the two pathways of photosynthesis in such plants could occur in the same leaves but not in the same cells, and that the two pathways could not couple but only occur side by side. It is now known, however, that in at least some species such as &quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;, C4 and CAM photosynthesis are fully integrated within the same cells, and that CAM-generated metabolites are incorporated directly into the C4 cycle.

==Biochemistry== 

Plants with CAM must control storage of and its reduction to branched carbohydrates in space and time.

At low temperatures (frequently at night), plants using CAM open their stomata, molecules diffuse into the spongy mesophyll&#x27;s intracellular spaces and then into the cytoplasm. Here, they can meet phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is a phosphorylated triose. During this time, the plants are synthesizing a protein called PEP carboxylase kinase (PEP-C kinase), whose expression can be inhibited by high temperatures (frequently at daylight) and the presence of malate. PEP-C kinase phosphorylates its target enzyme PEP carboxylase (PEP-C). Phosphorylation dramatically enhances the enzyme&#x27;s capability to catalyze the formation of oxaloacetate, which can be subsequently transformed into malate by NAD+ malate dehydrogenase. Malate is then transported via malate shuttles into the vacuole, where it is converted into the storage form malic acid. In contrast to PEP-C kinase, PEP-C is synthesized all the time but almost inhibited at daylight either by dephosphorylation via PEP-C phosphatase or directly by binding malate. The latter is not possible at low temperatures, since malate is efficiently transported into the vacuole, whereas PEP-C kinase readily inverts dephosphorylation.

In daylight, plants using CAM close their guard cells and discharge malate that is subsequently transported into chloroplasts. There, depending on plant species, it is cleaved into pyruvate and either by malic enzyme or by PEP carboxykinase. is then introduced into the Calvin cycle, a coupled and self-recovering enzyme system, which is used to build branched carbohydrates. The by-product pyruvate can be further degraded in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle, thereby providing additional molecules for the Calvin Cycle. Pyruvate can also be used to recover PEP via pyruvate phosphate dikinase, a high-energy step, which requires ATP and an additional phosphate. During the following cool night, PEP is finally exported into the cytoplasm, where it is involved in fixing carbon dioxide via malate.

==Use by plants==
Plants use CAM to different degrees. Some are &quot;obligate CAM plants&quot;, i.e. they use only CAM in photosynthesis, although they vary in the amount of they are able to store as organic acids; they are sometimes divided into &quot;strong CAM&quot; and &quot;weak CAM&quot; plants on this basis. Other plants show &quot;inducible CAM&quot;, in which they are able to switch between using either the or mechanism and CAM depending on environmental conditions. Another group of plants employ &quot;CAM-cycling&quot;, in which their stomata do not open at night; the plants instead recycle produced by respiration as well as storing some during the day.

Plants showing inducible CAM and CAM-cycling are typically found in conditions where periods of water shortage alternate with periods when water is freely available. Periodic drought – a feature of semi-arid regions – is one cause of water shortage. Plants which grow on trees or rocks (as epiphytes or lithophytes) also experience variations in water availability. Salinity, high light levels and nutrient availability are other factors which have been shown to induce CAM.

Since CAM is an adaptation to arid conditions, plants using CAM often display other xerophytic characters, such as thick, reduced leaves with a low surface-area-to-volume ratio; thick cuticle; and stomata sunken into pits. Some shed their leaves during the dry season; others (the succulents) store water in vacuoles. CAM also causes taste differences: plants may have an increasingly sour taste during the night yet become sweeter-tasting during the day. This is due to malic acid being stored in the vacuoles of the plants&#x27; cells during the night and then being used up during the day.

==Aquatic CAM==
CAM photosynthesis is also found in aquatic species in at least 4 genera, including: &quot;Isoetes&quot;, &quot;Crassula&quot;, &quot;Littorella&quot;, &quot;Sagittaria&quot;, and possibly &quot;Vallisneria&quot;, being found in a variety of species e.g. &quot;Isoetes howellii&quot;, &quot;Crassula aquatica&quot;.

These plants follow the same nocturnal acid accumulation and daytime deacidification as terrestrial CAM species. However, the reason for CAM in aquatic plants is not due to a lack of available water, but a limited supply of . is limited due to slow diffusion in water, 10000x slower than in air. The problem is especially acute under acid pH, where the only inorganic carbon species present is , with no available bicarbonate or carbonate supply.

Aquatic CAM plants capture carbon at night when it is abundant due to a lack of competition from other photosynthetic organisms. This also results in lowered &quot;photorespiration&quot; due to less photosynthetically generated oxygen.

Aquatic CAM is most marked in the summer months when there is increased competition for , compared to the winter months. However, in the winter months CAM still has a significant role.

==Ecological and taxonomic distribution of CAM-using plants==
The majority of plants possessing CAM are either epiphytes (e.g., orchids, bromeliads) or succulent xerophytes (e.g., cacti, cactoid &quot;Euphorbia&quot;s), but CAM is also found in hemiepiphytes (e.g., &quot;Clusia&quot;); lithophytes (e.g., &quot;Sedum&quot;, &quot;Sempervivum&quot;); terrestrial bromeliads; wetland plants (e.g., &quot;Isoetes&quot;, &quot;Crassula&quot; (&quot;Tillaea&quot;), &quot;Lobelia&quot;); and in one halophyte, &quot;Mesembryanthemum crystallinum&quot;; one non-succulent terrestrial plant, (&quot;Dodonaea viscosa&quot;) and one mangrove associate (&quot;Sesuvium portulacastrum&quot;).

The only trees that can do CAM are in the genus &quot;Clusia&quot;; species of which are found across Central America, South America and the Caribbean. In &quot;Clusia&quot;, CAM is found in species that inhabit hotter, drier ecological niches, whereas species living in cooler montane forests tend to be . In addition, some species of &quot;Clusia&quot; can temporarily switch their photosynthetic physiology from to CAM, a process known as facultative CAM. This allows these trees to benefit from the elevated growth rates of photosynthesis, when water is plentiful, and the drought tolerant nature of CAM, when the dry season occurs. 

Plants which are able to switch between different methods of carbon fixation include &quot;Portulacaria afra&quot;, better known as Dwarf Jade Plant, which normally uses C3 fixation but can use CAM if it is drought-stressed, and &quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;, better known as Purslane, which normally uses fixation but is also able to switch to CAM when drought-stressed.

CAM has evolved convergently many times. It occurs in 16,000 species (about 7% of plants), belonging to over 300 genera and around 40 families, but this is thought to be a considerable underestimate. The great majority of plants using CAM are angiosperms (flowering plants) but it is found in ferns, Gnetopsida and in quillworts (relatives of club mosses). Interpretation of the first quillwort genome in 2021 (&quot;I. taiwanensis&quot;) suggested that its use of CAM was another example of convergent evolution. In Tillandsia CAM evolution has been associated with gene family expansion. 

The following list summarizes the taxonomic distribution of plants with CAM:

<text>Jordan Rudess (born Jordan Charles Rudes; November 4, 1956) is an American keyboardist, composer, and software developer, best known as a member of progressive metal band Dream Theater and the supergroup Liquid Tension Experiment.

== Biography ==
Rudess was born in 1956 in Great Neck, New York. His mother was the director of a music management company in Sea Cliff, New York, while his father owned a New York clothing manufacturer. 

He was recognized by his second-grade teacher for his piano playing and was immediately given professional instruction. At nine, he entered the Juilliard School of Music Pre-College Division for classical piano training, where his first theory instructor was future collaborator Joseph Lyons. He studied at Juilliard for seven years under Katherine Parker and Adele Marcus. By his late teens, he had developed an increasing interest in synthesizers and progressive rock music, citing his first experience in the genre as the Hammond playing and distorted stylistic expression of Jon Lord. Against the advice of his parents and tutors, he turned away from classical piano and pursued a career as a solo progressive rock keyboardist.

After Juilliard, one of his first bands was an &quot;electronic space music band&quot; called Complex. Formed by Rudess and former Juilliard instructor Joseph Lyons, along with Sal Gallina, they began playing college radio and house concerts. In January 1977, the band performed at Hansen Galleries in New York City. &quot;This is music of real interest and vitality, more rhythmic and popularly appealing than most so-called &#x27;serious&#x27; music,&quot; said the &quot;New York Times&quot; of the performance, &quot;yet never so blatantly exploitive as to arouse real cynicism.&quot; That spring, the band Ocean Star released an album featuring music by Complex. That summer, Rudess accompanied Lyons for a residency at the Lexington Conservatory Theatre in Lexington, NY. Rudess served as assistant musical director and co-composed scores for the theater productions with Lyons, including the world premiere of &quot;The Prevalence of Mrs. Seale&quot; by Otis Bigelow. The duo also performed a series of concerts for the Earful concert series throughout the summer.
When Bleu Ocean was assembling a team of fellow drummers to perform on the song &quot;Bring the Boys Back Home,&quot; featured on Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall,&quot; he invited Rudess for the sessions, since Rudess had played drums as a child. However, Rudess&#x27;s performance was rejected by producer Bob Ezrin. At that time, Rudess had already chosen keyboards as his main instrument.

Rudess was part of a studio project assembled by bubblegum pop impresarios Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz, who were also behind The Ohio Express and The 1910 Fruitgum Company. In 1980, they ventured into album-oriented rock with Speedway Boulevard, which also featured touring members of Ram Jam. The group never performed live and disbanded shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

After participating in various projects during the 1980s, he gained international attention in 1994 when he was voted &quot;Best New Talent&quot; in the &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; readers&#x27; poll following the release of his &quot;Listen&quot; solo album. Two of the bands that took notice of Rudess were The Dixie Dregs and Dream Theater, both of whom invited him to join. Rudess chose the Dregs, primarily because being a part-time member of the band would have less of an impact on his young family, a choice he was not given with Dream Theater.

During his time with the Dregs, Rudess formed a &quot;power duo&quot; with drummer Rod Morgenstein. The genesis of this pairing occurred when a power outage caused all of the Dregs&#x27; instruments to fail except Rudess&#x27;s, so he and Morgenstein improvised with each other until power was restored and the concert could continue. The chemistry between the two was so strong during this jam that they decided to perform together regularly (under the name &quot;Rudess/Morgenstein Project&quot; or later &quot;RMP&quot;) and have since released a studio album and a live record.

Rudess encountered Dream Theater once again when he and Morgenstein secured the support slot on one of Dream Theater&#x27;s North American tours.

In 1997, when Mike Portnoy was asked to form a supergroup by Magna Carta Records, Rudess was chosen to fill the keyboardist spot in the band, which also included Tony Levin and Portnoy&#x27;s Dream Theater colleague John Petrucci. During the recording of Liquid Tension Experiment&#x27;s two albums, it became evident to Portnoy and Petrucci that Rudess was what Dream Theater needed. They asked Rudess to join the band, and when he accepted, they released their then-keyboardist Derek Sherinian to make way for him.

Rudess has been the full-time keyboardist in Dream Theater since the recording of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot;. He has recorded eleven other studio albums with the group: 2002&#x27;s &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Octavarium&quot;, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;, 2009&#x27;s &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;, 2011&#x27;s &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot;, 2013&#x27;s &quot;Dream Theater&quot;, 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Astonishing&quot;, 2019&#x27;s &quot;Distance over Time&quot;, 2021&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Top of the World&quot;, and 2025&#x27;s &quot;Parasomnia&quot;. In addition, he has appeared on the live albums &quot;Live Scenes From New York&quot;, &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;, &quot;Score&quot;, &quot;Chaos in Motion&quot;, &quot;Live at Luna Park&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Fourth Wall&quot;, and &quot;Distant Memories – Live in London&quot;.
In addition to working with Dream Theater, he occasionally records and performs in other contexts, such as a 2001 one-off duo performance with Petrucci (released as the CD &quot;An Evening With John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess&quot;), as well as backing up Blackfield on their first short US tour in 2005 and playing a solo opening slot for them on their second tour in 2007. He also contributed to Steven Wilson&#x27;s albums Grace for Drowning and Insurgentes.

In 2010, Rudess composed &quot;Explorations for Keyboard and Orchestra,&quot; his first classical composition. It was premiered in Caracas, Venezuela, on November 19, 2010, by the Chacao Youth Symphony Orchestra and guest conductor Eren Başbuğ. Rudess played all of the keyboard and synthesizer parts.

On July 28, 2011, in a poll conducted by MusicRadar, Rudess was voted the best keyboardist of all time.

Rudess cites his influences as a keyboardist to include Keith Emerson, Tony Banks, Rick Wakeman, and Patrick Moraz. His favorite musical artists and groups include Gentle Giant, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, Autechre, and Aphex Twin.

Rudess claims to have perfect pitch.

Rudess appeared on the Ayreon album, &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, released on October 28, 2013.

== Use of technology ==
While many keyboard players in progressive rock tend to bring numerous keyboards on stage, creating large racks of instruments, Rudess samples sounds from other keyboards he owns and maps them to a single keyboard. Each &quot;setup&quot; assigns different sounds to various layers and key ranges of the keyboard controller; these setups are then arranged in the order they will be required for a gig and cycled through with a footswitch.

From the 1990s onward, he used a Kurzweil K2600XS during live sets until switching in 2005 to Korg&#x27;s Oasys workstation, which he first utilized on Dream Theater&#x27;s 2005–2006 20th Anniversary tour. He also employed a Muse Receptor hardware VST and a Haken Continuum X/Y/Z-plane MIDI instrument, triggering a Roland V-Synth XT and a synthesizers.com modular unit designed by Richard Lainhart and Roger Arrick. Influenced by Lainhart, Rudess was the first well-known keyboardist to bring a Haken Continuum onto a live stage. Rudess kept the Kurzweil for studio recordings and for some of his signature sounds, such as &quot;the pig,&quot; which is often played in unison with the guitar or bass guitar.

In 2011, Rudess switched from the Oasys to the new flagship Korg Kronos. In 2019, he added a Roland Ax-Edge keytar and a Hammond XK-5 to his live setup, which were used on Dream Theater&#x27;s 2019 record &quot;Distance over Time&quot;. His current live rig consists of the Kronos, along with a Continuum, a Hammond XK-5, a Roland AX-Edge, a lap steel guitar, a Harpejji, and an iPad.

Since 2001, Rudess has used custom-made swiveling keyboard stands on stage for both Dream Theater and his solo career, which are built by Patrick Slaats from the Netherlands. On Dream Theater&#x27;s 2007–2008 &quot;Chaos in Motion Tour,&quot; Rudess expanded his live setup with the addition of a Korg RADIAS, a Manikin Memotron, and a Zen Riffer keytar. Rudess stopped using his Synthesizers.com modular after the European leg of the tour due to its size and weight. He still owns the synthesizer and keeps it in his home studio. During the Progressive Nation 2008 tour, he introduced a Kaoss Pad 3 on stage for the closing medley.

For the 2009–2010 tour in support of &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;, Rudess introduced the Apple iPhone on stage, running an application called Bebot Robot Synth. Rudess originally used Bebot on the studio recording of &quot;A Rite of Passage.&quot; In live performances, he utilized it on the same song, as well as in improvised solos featured in &quot;Hollow Years&quot; and &quot;Solitary Shell.&quot;

On September 24, 2010, Rudess released the song &quot;Krump,&quot; an electronica single, on iTunes. It featured the use of the new Roland Gaia, Roland&#x27;s more recent keyboard.

== Music educator ==
Rudess was frequently asked about private music lessons, but his touring commitments kept him busy. He ultimately developed a course available through a book and video titled &quot;Keyboard Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Total Keyboard Wizardry.&quot; He went on to create additional series such as &quot;Keyboard Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Keyboard Madness.&quot; These included lessons on composition, improvisation, keyboard playing techniques, rhythm and pitch exercises, and aural training. Some of the courses even addressed sound design and approaches to arrangement, style, composition, and recording. These courses are available in music stores and on specific websites, including YousicPlay, MacProVideo, Patreon, Pianote, AskVideo, and many others, along with his very own Online Conservatory.

In addition to recording videos, eBooks, hardcopy books, and support materials, Rudess has also served as a guest lecturer both on campus and online during the lockdown (or, as he described it, when the world stopped... for a while). This has been an ongoing effort for quite some time. He has been a lecturer for various seasons at numerous institutes, music schools, and music colleges. Jordan Rudess taught music, with a particular focus on keyboard techniques, at Berklee College of Music in the United States and Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music (SAM) in India, and has conducted guest lectures at Stanford.

== Software development ==

In 2010, Rudess started a software company called Wizdom Music. He partnered with artists such as Kevin Chartier, Felipe Peña, and Eyal Amir (from Project RnL), creating new types of musical instrumental user interfaces and experiences, sound synthesis, and innovative ways of recording and performing music with tablet computers.

Wizdom Music created the following software:
* SampleWiz – a touch screen-enabled sampler and self-sampler for the iPhone and iPad
* MorphWiz – a dynamic touch screen music creation controller for iOS, Android, and Windows 8-enabled touch pads and laptops
* Geo Synthesizer – a new digital music controller interface for the iPhone and iPad
* HarmonyWiz – a harmonic analysis and generator tool that can create multi-part harmonies from tracks either played or manually entered in-app
* EarWizard – a tool to help users recognize the pitch of notes and chords by ear, with progressive difficulty levels
* GeoShred – a guitar simulator app that can be played on a touch screen and allows various parameters of the instrument (e.g., string type, pick position, body type) to be varied

== Personal life ==
Rudess married Nancy Kornfield in 1989 at a temple in Greenwich, Connecticut.

<text>TVO (stylized in all lowercase as tvo), formerly known as TVOntario, is a Canadian publicly funded English-language educational television network and media organization serving the Canadian province of Ontario. It operates flagship station CICA-DT (channel 19) in Toronto, which also relays programming across portions of Ontario through eight rebroadcast stations. All pay television (cable, satellite, IPTV) providers throughout Ontario are required to carry TVO on their basic tier, and programming can be streamed for free online within Canada.

TVO is operated by the Ontario Educational Communications Authority (OECA), a Crown corporation owned by the Government of Ontario, which since 2022 has done business as the TVO Media Education Group (or TVO.me). TVO.me also operates TVO Today, TVO ILC, TVO Learn, and TVOKids.

==Governance, funding and other responsibilities==
TVO is governed by a volunteer board of directors, and supported by a network of regional councillors from across the province. TVO also reports to the Ontario legislature through the Minister of Education, in accordance with the Ontario Educational Communications Authority Act.

Instead of following the model of the federally owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&#x27;s television services, which shows commercial advertisements, TVO chose a commercial-free model similar to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States (in fact, various TVO productions wound up being aired on PBS stations). This model was later emulated by provincial educational broadcasters Télé-Québec in Quebec and Knowledge Network in British Columbia. 

The majority of TVO&#x27;s funding is provided by the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Education, which provides $54.4 million annually, with additional funding provided by charitable donations. In 2023, TVO&#x27;s total revenue was $66 million.

TVO is also responsible for over-the-air broadcasts of the Ontario Legislative Assembly in some remote Northern Ontario communities that do not receive cable television access to the Ontario Parliament Network.

In 2002, the Ministry of Education transferred responsibility for the Independent Learning Centre—the agency which provides distance education at the elementary and secondary school level—to TVO.

TVO used to operate TFO (), a separate but similar network for Franco-Ontarian audiences. Before the launch of TFO, TVO aired French-language programming on Sundays. Even after TFO&#x27;s launch, TVO and TFO swapped programming on Sundays well into the 1990s. TFO was separated from TVO and was incorporated under the newly formed , a separate Crown corporation of the Government of Ontario, in 2007.

In 2017 and 2018, TVO launched four regional &quot;hubs&quot;, featuring journalism on issues in the various regions of Ontario, on its website. Hubs are currently based in Thunder Bay for the Northwestern Ontario region, Sudbury for Northeastern Ontario, Kingston for Eastern Ontario, and London for Southwestern Ontario. In 2019, the service also launched an Indigenous hub to cover First Nations issues throughout the province.

==History==

===1970s===

The Ontario Educational Communications Authority (OECA) was created in June 1970 by then Education Minister Bill Davis. At that time, the OECA produced children&#x27;s and educational programming which was aired on commercial television stations.

The CBC, acting on behalf of OECA, applied for and won a licence for the ministry&#x27;s television station in Toronto. CICA, with the mandate of &quot;[using] electronic and associated media to provide educational opportunities for all people in Ontario&quot;. The &quot;CA&quot; in the CICA callsign was derived from the last two letters in the OECA acronym. CBC operated the CICA transmitter, while the OECA was in charge of programming. OECA assumed all operations of the station, independent of the CBC, when the provincial government declared the Authority an independent corporation in a 1973 Order-in-Council.
CICA signed on the air on September 27, 1970, on UHF channel 19 operating at a radiated power of 423,000 watts video and 84,600 watts audio. Its studio facilities were located at 1670 Bayview Avenue (a five-storey office building that is still standing) and its transmitter antenna was located at 354 Jarvis Street on the CBC tower. In 1972, the station moved its operations to a new studio facility at 2180 Yonge Street in the Canada Square Complex, where it remains. The station&#x27;s broadcast name was &quot;OECA&quot;, sharing the name of its parent organization, but began using the on-air brand &quot;TVOntario&quot; (and later just TVO) beginning in 1974.

When the Global Television Network was originally approved, it was with a proposal that OECA would broadcast across southern Ontario during the daytime using Global&#x27;s six transmitters, as Global&#x27;s own programming only ran from 5 p.m. to midnight. However, when Global launched in 1974, this proposal was not implemented.

In the latter half of the 1970s, TVO began adding rebroadcast transmitters in other Ontario communities. Its first rebroadcast transmitter, CICO (now CICO-24), signed on from Ottawa on October 25, 1975.

===1980s–1990s===

In 1987, TVOntario launched , a French-language public television network which became TFO in 1995. The Ontario government under Mike Harris promised to privatize TVOntario. They never carried through on this plan, but did cut its budget.

===2000s===

The positions of chair and CEO were divided in 2005. Film producer Peter O&#x27;Brian was appointed chairman and Lisa de Wilde became CEO. On June 29, 2006, the provincial Ministry of Education announced a major overhaul of TVO: its production capabilities would be upgraded to fully digital systems by 2009 (ministry funding would be allocated for this); and TFO would be spun off into a separate organization.

Moreover, programming changes were announced later that day: thirteen hours of new weekly children&#x27;s educational programming was added, &quot;Studio 2&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Agenda&quot;, and &quot;More to Life&quot; and &quot;Vox&quot; were cancelled. The move to digitize services represents a transition; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; quoted TVO CEO Lisa de Wilde saying &quot;while television will remain an important medium for TVO, the days of defining ourselves as only a broadcaster are past.&quot;

In 2002, the Independent Learning Centre, which is responsible for distance education at the elementary and secondary school level, and for GED testing, was transferred from the Ministry of Education to TVO.

==Programming==
TVO airs a mixture of original children&#x27;s programming, documentaries, scripted dramas, and public affairs programs.

Children&#x27;s programming is aired daily during a daytime television block branded as TVOKids, with general-audience programming airing during prime time and overnight hours for adult viewers. Scripted dramas are typically foreign imports, past selections include the Danish political drama &quot;Borgen&quot; and the British police procedural &quot;New Tricks&quot;. TVO&#x27;s first original drama series was &quot;Hard Rock Medical&quot;, a medical drama set in Sudbury, which aired from 2013 to 2018. Public affairs programming includes the flagship daily current affairs show &quot;The Agenda&quot; and an overnight rebroadcast of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario&#x27;s Question Period from the Ontario Parliament Network.

All TVO programming is aired in English or in another language with English subtitles. French-language programs were previously shown on Sundays, from noon until sign-off, for the benefit of Franco-Ontarian viewers. The establishment of French counterpart network TFO led to the discontinuation of French-language programming on TVO by the mid-1990s.

===Former programming===
Earlier in TVO&#x27;s history, all dramatic programming was required to have some educational content. Therefore actors, journalists or writers were hired to provide commentary on shows aired by TVO that would place them within an educational context. For instance, &quot;Tom Grattan&#x27;s War&quot; was bookmarked by segments hosted by Andrea Martin that would use scenes from the series to discuss filmmaking techniques. Episodes of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; were hosted by journalist Warner Troyer whose segments included interviews with the actors and a discussion of various psychological, philosophical or sociological themes regarding the series. Similarly, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was hosted by science fiction author Judith Merril who would discuss each week&#x27;s episode to explore various themes in science and science fiction. &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; continued to follow this format long after the requirement was dropped because of the popularity of its host, Elwy Yost.

==Distribution==
TVO is Canada&#x27;s oldest educational television service. It established the country&#x27;s first UHF television station in 1970, based in Toronto. TVO used to have the largest over-the-air coverage in Ontario, reaching 98.5% of the province with 216 transmitters; however this is no longer the case as the broadcaster shuttered the majority of its analogue transmitters except those located in some mandatory markets, which were converted to digital in 2011 (see &quot;Technical information&quot; below). TVO is carried on all cable systems serving Ontario (the alternative choice for those viewers in area that has been served by one of the service&#x27;s defunct analogue transmitters). On satellite systems in Ontario, it is carried on Bell Satellite TV channel 265, and on Shaw Direct channel 155.

The main transmitter in Toronto uses the call sign CICA-DT, with its rebroadcasters using CICO-DT followed by a number to denote their status as rebroadcasters. Many analogue transmitters used CICA-TV and CICO-TV callsigns, in addition to CICE-TV, until the shutdown of TVO&#x27;s remaining analogue transmitters on July 31, 2012.

TVO&#x27;s transmitters are primarily located in Ontario, with the only exception being its Ottawa transmitter, CICO-DT-24, which is based at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec. There, it shares its site with its Quebec counterpart, Télé-Québec, and with most of the region&#x27;s television and FM radio signals.

From the 1970s through the 1990s, TVO ran top-of-the-hour bumpers where an announcer would mention the channel allocation of the service&#x27;s flagship station in Toronto, along with an allocation for one of its rebroadcast transmitters: &quot;This is TVOntario. Channel 19 in Toronto, channel XX in (city/town/region).&quot;

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===

In August 2010, TVO began broadcasting in high-definition via a direct-to-cable HD feed. TVO commenced over-the-air HD broadcasting in August 2011, in compliance with the CRTC regulations. Except for Belleville, Chatham and Cloyne, TVO&#x27;s transmitters are located within mandatory markets for conversion. Not all digital transmitters are currently broadcasting in high definition.

The Belleville, Chatham and Cloyne transmitters were converted to digital on new frequencies (but without high-definition, an on-channel program guide or other DTV-specific features), as channels 52 to 69 were being reallocated for wireless communication purposes. The conversion of these transmitters took place before TVO&#x27;s announcement to close down its analogue transmitter network outside the mandatory markets.

===Transmitters===
On January 25, 2017, TVO announced it would be shutting down eight of its nine remaining transmitters (a mere 5½ years after converting them to digital), leaving only CICA-DT at Toronto&#x27;s CN Tower in operation to maintain their current license. CEO Lisa de Wilde announced that shutting down the transmitters would save the broadcaster an estimated $1 million per year, but would also lay off seven transmitter maintenance jobs. Critics of the decision, including the group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, said that the changes would affect people who have no other options for accessing content.

TVO formally applied to the CRTC on January 25, 2017, to remove its eight transmitters outside Toronto from service.

In response to feedback from the towns and cities affected by the planned shutdown, as well as TVO donors and other groups, TVO reversed its decision to shut down the transmitters on February 17, 2017. According to TVO, the Government of Ontario agreed to increase TVO&#x27;s annual funding by $1 million to offset the amount that would have been saved by shutting down the transmitters. On March 1, 2017, TVO formally withdrew its CRTC application to delete its eight retransmitters from its licence.

In April 2017, ISED required TVO to move its newly-digital retransmitters serving Belleville, Chatham, Cloyne, Kitchener, and Windsor from out of the 600 MHz band between 2019 and 2020 as part of the related spectrum pack.

On April 17, 2020, the CRTC granted TVO permission to decrease its Chatham transmitter&#x27;s maximum effective radiated power (ERP) from 2,250 to 1,000 watts. Even though this would reduce over-the-air access to viewers in the Chatham area, the CRTC approved TVO&#x27;s request so that it could &quot;reduce the costs associated with the required channel change by re-using its existing antenna&quot; as part of Canada&#x27;s 600 MHz spectrum repack. TVO announced it would make the change as of May 1, 2020. TVO similarly reduced the ERP of its other retransmitters required to move out of the 600 MHz band.

===Former transmitters===

On July 31, 2012, TVO permanently shut down its remaining 114 analogue transmitters (14 full-power and 100 low-power) without converting them to digital; these were in areas of Ontario not considered &quot;mandatory markets&quot; for digital conversion by the CRTC. In many cases, TVO rebroadcasters were operating from CBC-owned transmitter sites and were shut down along with the CBC&#x27;s analogue transmitters. Where TVO owned sites, it provided local communities the option of taking ownership of the towers and transmitters.

===Carriage dispute===
On June 6, 2012, TVO dropped its signal from cable and satellite providers outside Ontario, due to a carriage dispute over compensation for distributing its signal to its subscribers outside the province. The network reached an agreement with Vidéotron, and then entered negotiations with Shaw Communications and Telus, but failed to reach an agreement with Bell Canada. TVO cited that: &quot;...we believe that we have a responsibility to earn revenues from the sale of our service outside of our home province. TVO is willing to consent to cable and satellite distributors carrying our signal outside the province, provided that we&#x27;re fairly compensated. Since cable or satellite distributors receive subscriber revenues driven by having TVO as part of their offering, we feel it&#x27;s reasonable to be compensated. Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement with Bell to compensate TVO for carrying our signal outside of Ontario, and the decision was made to cease offering our signal outside of Ontario.&quot; As a result, the only cable and satellite customers outside Ontario that can still view TVO are on the Quebec side of the Ottawa–Gatineau market.

It is unknown if the dispute or carriage restrictions also apply to the few cable systems in the United States that carry TVO.

<doc id="428891" wikidata="Q410951" url="?curid=428891" title="U.S. Route 400">
<text>U.S. Route 400 (US 400) is a mostly east–west U.S. Highway, commissioned in 1994. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is in Granada, Colorado, at an intersection with US 385. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is southwest of Joplin, Missouri, near Loma Linda, at an interchange with Interstate 44, with which it shares with US 166. It originally ended in Garden City, Kansas; in 1996 it was extended to its current western terminus.

==Route description==
The route number does not follow the numbering convention for U.S. Highways established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The number 400 implies the route is a spur of U.S. Route 0, which does not exist.

===Colorado===
US 400 begins in Granada at an intersection with US 385. It then runs concurrently with US 50 through Holly east to the Kansas border.

===Kansas===

US 400 and US 50 enter Kansas west of Coolidge. They run concurrently through Garden City, where it intersects US 83 and separate at Dodge City, which is where it intersects US 56 and US 283. It continues southeast from Dodge City and first intersects US 54 at Mullinville.

US 400 and US 54 begin a long concurrency at Mullinville which passes through Greensburg, Pratt and Kingman before entering Wichita. While in Wichita, US 400 and US 54 intersect Interstate 235 and the concurrency of US 81 and Interstate 135. K-96 provides a short freeway connection to Interstate 35, which is also the Kansas Turnpike. At Augusta, US 400 and US 54 enter into another concurrency with US 77, and US 400 breaks from this concurrency at Haverhill.
US 400 continues east through several small towns before turning southeast to go through the Fredonia area and intersecting US 75 at Neodesha. After a brief concurrency with US 75, it turns east, first intersecting U.S. Route 169 near Morehead and then US 59 near Parsons before finally intersecting US 69 south of Pittsburg. It then turns south with US 69 and at Crestline, follows US 69A south to Riverton. US 400 then turns east with US 166 at Baxter Springs and the two highways run concurrently eastward into Missouri.

The entire section of US 400 in Cimarron is maintained by the city.

===Missouri===

US 400, along with US 166, terminates at I-44 about one mile (1.6 km) east of the Kansas-Missouri state line, three miles (5 km) west of Joplin.

==History==
US 400 was first established on December 1, 1994, and at that time ran from the east end of the US-50 and US-83 overlap, eastward to the east county line of Cherokee County, Kansas.

In a May 3, 1995 resolution, it was approved to move US-400 and K-96 to a new alignment between northwest of Fredonia and Neodesha, at that time the overlap with K-47 was removed. In a December 3, 1998 resolution, it was approved to truncate K-96 to end at US-400 by Wichita.

===U.S. Route 154===

A section of U.S. 400 that ran from Dodge City to Mullinville, Kansas was U.S. Route 154 from 1926 to 1982. It later became K-154 before becoming part of U.S. 400.

Construction on the first section of the East Kellogg improvement project started in August 2015. The project included a redesigned intersection with Webb Road and widened US-54 and US-400 from four lanes to six lanes from Webb Road to Greenwich Road. Construction on a second project began in 2016, to continue widening the highway to a six-lane freeway between Greenwich Road and K-96. Also new bridges will be built over I-35/KTA, new ramps will be constructed from southbound I-35/KTA to westbound US-54/US-400 and from eastbound US-54/US-400 to both northbound and southbound I-35/KTA. In addition, two-lane one way frontage roads on each side of the freeway will be built. Construction for both projects were completed around September of 2021. A two-mile section of the new highway, from Eastern Street to the K-96 junction, opened on November 21, 2019. On April 16, 2020, vandals damaged an estimated $50,000 worth of construction equipment, which included a bulldozer, excavator and an off-road vehicle.

<doc id="428893" wikidata="Q221468" url="?curid=428893" title="Mike Portnoy">
<text>Michael Stephen Portnoy (born April 20, 1967) is an American musician who is primarily known as the drummer, backing vocalist, and co-founder of progressive metal band Dream Theater.

In September 2010, Portnoy announced his departure from Dream Theater after 25 years, with Mike Mangini taking his place as drummer of the band. In October 2023, 13 years after his departure, the band announced his return. During his time out of Dream Theater, Portnoy remained active, with a variety of bands and projects, including Adrenaline Mob, Avenged Sevenfold, Transatlantic, Yellow Matter Custard, Flying Colors, The Winery Dogs, Liquid Tension Experiment, Metal Allegiance, Sons of Apollo, the Neal Morse Band, and BPMD.

== Early life ==
Portnoy was born on April 20, 1967, in Long Beach, New York. He is Jewish. His father, Howard Portnoy (1940–2009), worked as a DJ at a local radio station. Mike and his father later moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to work at KRML radio station after watching the 1971 film &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;. His mother died on November 16, 1984, when the private plane she was riding in, with her boyfriend, crashed off the Atlantic City coastline.

His father&#x27;s job as a DJ helped Portnoy gain an appreciation for music at an early age, as he had access to his father&#x27;s collection of LPs. He developed a preference for bands Rush, Kiss, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Iron Maiden, and The Beatles, among others. Portnoy claims to be self-taught as a drummer, though he did take music theory classes in high school. During that period he began playing in local bands. With Rising Power and Inner Sanctum he recorded and released independent albums.

==Career==
===Dream Theater: 1985–2010, 2023–present===
Portnoy left Inner Sanctum, his last high school band, after being awarded a scholarship to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston. There, he met John Petrucci and John Myung. They formed a band called Majesty, which was later changed to Dream Theater. Soon after they all left Berklee.

Known for his technical skill as a drummer in Dream Theater, Portnoy has won 32 awards from the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine. He is the second youngest person (after Neil Peart) to be inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame, at 37 years of age. He was one of the main songwriters during his first tenure with Dream Theater. He co-produced six of their albums with guitarist John Petrucci, starting from &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; through &quot;Black Clouds and Silver Linings&quot;.
In the spring of 2010, Portnoy filled in for Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s former drummer, Jimmy &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan, who died during the production of the band&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Nightmare&quot;. On May 5, 2010, Portnoy released a statement on his status with Avenged Sevenfold on their official website, concluding his working relationship with the band.

In September 2010, Portnoy announced he was leaving Dream Theater. The band hired Mike Mangini to take his place after inviting and holding auditions with seven &quot;world-class&quot; drummers.

Avenged Sevenfold chose not to continue working with Portnoy after the &quot;Nightmare&quot; tour was completed, in part due to the significant controversy surrounding his departure from Dream Theater. Following this, Portnoy announced that he asked to return to Dream Theater, but was turned down by their lawyer as the band had already brought Mangini fully onboard and he had left his tenured teaching position at Berklee College of Music to join the band.

On October 25, 2023, Dream Theater announced that Portnoy was returning to the band, Portnoy having gradually reconciled with the band throughout his 13-year absence before lastly reconciling with James LaBrie in 2022 at the band&#x27;s show at the Beacon Theatre in New York. His first album with the band in 15 years, &quot;Parasomnia&quot; was released on February 7, 2025.

===Former and current projects: 1997–2023===
Portnoy is known for his many side projects and tribute bands. He is a founding member of Liquid Tension Experiment, an instrumental progressive rock band featuring fellow Dream Theater members John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess along with bassist Tony Levin. He is also a founding member of Transatlantic, a progressive rock &quot;super-group&quot; featuring former Spock&#x27;s Beard keyboardist/vocalist Neal Morse, Flower Kings guitarist Roine Stolt and Marillion bassist Pete Trewavas. Outside of Transatlantic, Portnoy has worked with Neal Morse extensively, appearing on most of his solo albums. He is a member of The Neal Morse Band, featuring guitarist/vocalist Eric Gillette, bassist Randy George, and second keyboardist/vocalist Bill Hubauer. Portnoy has also recorded and/or toured/performed live with Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, OSI, Hail!, Stone Sour, Fates Warning, Overkill and G3. Over the years, Portnoy has created tribute bands to the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rush, and the Who.

After his departure from Dream Theater, Portnoy formed several new bands, starting with Adrenaline Mob, a traditional heavy metal/hard rock band with singer Russell Allen (of Symphony X) and guitarist Mike Orlando. On June 4, 2013, however, Portnoy announced his departure from Adrenaline Mob, citing scheduling conflicts.

Portnoy is a founding member of Flying Colors, a progressive rock band also featuring Steve Morse, Neal Morse, Dave LaRue, and Casey McPherson.

He also founded The Winery Dogs, a power trio also featuring bassist Billy Sheehan (Mr. Big) and guitarist Richie Kotzen (formerly of Mr. Big and Poison); Sons of Apollo, a progressive metal supergroup also featuring Sheehan, Derek Sherinian, Jeff Scott Soto and Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal; Metal Allegiance, a thrash metal/groove metal band also featuring Mark Menghi, David Ellefson (Megadeth) and Alex Skolnick (Testament); and BPMD, a supergroup/cover band also featuring Menghi, Phil Demmel (Vio-lence) and Bobby &quot;Blitz&quot; Ellsworth (Overkill). He was also a member of PSMS, with Tony Macalpine, Billy Sheehan and Derek Sherinian.

Portnoy also drummed with Twisted Sister from 2015 to 2016, following the death of longtime drummer A. J. Pero. He also played with the band at their one-off performance in 2023.

==Artistry and influences==
In the April 2001 edition of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; and Portnoy&#x27;s website, he names Neil Peart, Ringo Starr, Phil Collins, John Bonham and Keith Moon as influences.

Portnoy played bass when Dream Theater performed as the fictitious band Nightmare Cinema. Before live performances of &quot;Trial of Tears&quot;, he would sometimes switch instruments with John Petrucci and play a fragment of &quot;Eruption&quot; by Van Halen. In Nightmare Cinema, he went by the stage name &quot;Max Del Fuvio&quot;.

Portnoy played bass guitar and xylophone during a song on &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 2&quot;. He has also contributed lead and harmony vocals to numerous projects.

==Progressive Nation==

In 2008, Portnoy organized a tour called &quot;Progressive Nation&quot;. Dream Theater headlined the touring festival and were joined by Opeth, Between the Buried and Me and 3. Portnoy stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been wanting to assemble a package tour like this for many years now. With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I&#x27;ve been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. I decided it was time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk.&quot;

In 2009, the tour returned with Dream Theater headlining once more and joined by Zappa Plays Zappa, Pain of Salvation, and Beardfish.

In 2014, Portnoy rebooted Progressive Nation as a 4-day cruising music festival called &quot;Progressive Nation at Sea&quot;. The event took place on the Norwegian Pearl on February 18–22, 2014 sailing from Miami, FL to the Bahamas. Portnoy organized the cruise with help from Derek Sherinian, and music festival company, Sixthman. Portnoy performed in three different bands on the cruise, Transatlantic, Portnoy, Sheehan, MacAlpine, Sherinian (PSMS), and Bigelf. Also rounding out the cruise were a large number of other progressive rock artists, Jon Anderson, Adrian Belew&#x27;s Power Trio, Devin Townsend Project, King&#x27;s X, Spock&#x27;s Beard, The Flower Kings, Pain of Salvation, Anathema, Riverside, Periphery, Animals as Leaders, The Safety Fire, Tony Harnell &amp; Bumblefoot, Beardfish, The Dear Hunter, Haken, Jolly, Anneke Van Giersbergen, Mark Mikel, and his son, Max Portnoy&#x27;s band, Next to None. Portnoy describes what the cruise was like: &quot;Progressive Nation at Sea still remains one of my proudest career memories…at the time, music cruises were just beginning to blossom and to be given the opportunity to assemble such an amazing lineup was a dream come true for me&quot;.

Since &quot;Progressive Nation at Sea 2014&quot;, Portnoy went on to join forces with another cruising progressive rock music festival, &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot;, to merge the vision and musical lineups. CTTE has been sailing annually since then.

==Personal life==
Portnoy and his wife Marlene (née Apuzzo) live in Upper Saucon Township in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania with their children, Melody Ruthandrea (born May 3, 1997) and Max John (born March 7, 1999).

Portnoy is a recovering addict and has openly discussed it. The five song set &quot;Twelve-step Suite&quot; deals with his experience of substance abuse. He edged away from alcohol and drugs in April 2000 and has remained sober since then.

== Equipment ==
Portnoy endorses Tama drums, Sabian cymbals, Promark drumsticks and Remo drumheads. Though Portnoy is mainly a drummer and backing vocalist he also contributes lead vocals, bass guitar and keyboards.

<text>Fortunio Bonanova, pseudonym of Josep Lluís Moll, (13 January 1895 – 2 April 1969) was a Spanish baritone singer and a film, theater, and television actor. He occasionally worked as a producer and director.

According to Lluis Fàbregas Cuixart, the pseudonym &quot;Fortunio Bonanova&quot; referred to his desire to seek fortune, and his love of the Bonanova neighborhood in his native Palma.

== Biography ==
As a young man, living under his birthname, he was a professional telegraph operator. He studied music with the Italian Giovachini. In 1921, he debuted as a singer in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, at the Teatre Principal in Palma. That year, along with a group of Majorcan intellectuals and Jorge Luis Borges (who was briefly living in Majorca with his parents and sister), he signed the Ultraist Manifesto, using the name Fortunio Bonanova.

Also in 1921, he appeared in a silent film of &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot; by the brothers Baños, which was shown the following year in New York City and Hollywood. He later directed his own &quot;Don Juan&quot; in 1924.

In 1927, he acted in &quot;Love of Sunya&quot;, directed by Albert Parker and starring Gloria Swanson. In 1932 he had small parts in Hollywood productions featuring Joan Bennett and Mary Astor. In the same period, he appeared in New York in several operas as well as the zarzuelas &quot;La Canción del Olvido&quot; (&quot;The song of forgetting&quot;), &quot;La Duquesa del Tabarín&quot; (&quot;The Duchess of Tabarín&quot;), &quot;Los Gavilanes&quot;, and &quot;La Montería&quot;. In 1934, he returned to Spain, where he had a major role in the film &quot;El Desaparecido&quot; (&quot;The disappeared one&quot;) written and directed by Antonio Graciani. In 1935 he acted and sang in the film &quot;Poderoso Caballero&quot; (&quot;A Big Guy&quot;), directed by Màximo Nossik.

In 1936, with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he returned to the United States, where he played the role of Captain Bill in a film called &quot;Capitán Tormenta&quot;, directed by Jules Bernhardt. A sequence of increasingly larger acting and singing roles mostly in English-language films followed, especially after 1940. Among his roles were Signor Matiste, Susan Alexander Kane&#x27;s opera coach in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941); General Sebastiano in &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot; (1943); Don Miguel in &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (1942); Fernando in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943); Sam Garlopis in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944); and a singing Christopher Columbus in &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;. He continued for the next several decades in a miscellany of character roles.

Bonanova was also an uncredited technical consultant for the film &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; (1941), and produced and appeared in the Spanish-language film &quot;La Inmaculada&quot; (a name of the Virgin Mary, &quot;Immaculate&quot;)(1939).

Bonanova played the father of twins Esther Williams, and Ricardo Montalbán in the 1947 film &quot;Fiesta&quot;. In 1949, Bonanova collaborated with Ambrose Barker on a musical entitled &quot;Glamor/Glamour is the Gimmick.&quot; It got bad reviews—what may have been popular and witty when Barker developed it in the early 1930s didn’t make it in 1949.

In the 1950s, he appeared in an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as a fake psychic who uses his stage apparatus to make it appear as though Lucy is able to speak Spanish to her mother-in-law. In 1952, he played an Italian opera singer, Anthony Branchetti, in the fourth episode of &quot;My Little Margie&quot; where Margie helps her father by convincing Mr. Branchetti to appear at a party in his honor to impress a reluctant client of Honeywell &amp; Todd. In 1953 he played Lou Costello&#x27;s Uncle Bozzo in the Abbott &amp; Costello episode of &quot;Uncle Bozzo&#x27;s Visit.&quot; In 1955, he portrayed an opera star in an episode of the situation comedy &quot;Willy&quot;.

Bonanova died in 1969 in Woodland Hills, California of a cerebral hemorrhage and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<doc id="428896" wikidata="Q48336" url="?curid=428896" title="Provinces of Turkey">
<text>Turkey is divided into 81 provinces (). Each province is divided into a number of districts (). Each provincial government is seated in the central district (). For non-metropolitan municipality designated provinces, the central district bears the name of the province (e.g. the city/district of Rize is the central district of Rize Province). In the Ottoman Empire, the corresponding unit was the &quot;vilayet&quot;.

Each province is administered by an appointed governor () from the Ministry of the Interior.
==Background==
After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the official establishment of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923, changes were made to the administrative system. Two years later, Ardahan, Beyoğlu, Çatalca, Dersim, Ergani, Gelibolu, Genç, Kozan, Oltu, Muş, Siverek and Üsküdar provinces were transformed into districts. In 1927, Doğubayazıt was transformed into a district and was made a part of Ağrı. In 1929, Muş became a province again and Bitlis became a district. Four years later, Aksaray, Cebelibereket, Hakkâri and Şebinkarahisar became districts, Mersin and Silifke were merged to form a new province called İçel, and Artvin and Rize were merged to form a new province called Çoruh, bringing the number down to fifty-six. In 1936, Rize, Dersim and Hakkâri became provinces again, in the same year Dersim was renamed Tunceli; 3 years later in 1939, Hatay was annexed to Turkey and became a province. In 1953, it was decided that Uşak would become a province and that Kırşehir would be transformed into a district, one year later in 1954 Adıyaman, Nevşehir and Sakarya gained province status. In 1956, the name of Çoruh province was changed to Artvin, and in 1957 Kırşehir&#x27;s province status was restored. After this year, there were no changes in the number of provinces for the next 32 years until Aksaray, Bayburt, Karaman and Kırıkkale became provinces in 1989 along with Batman and Şırnak in 1990; Bartın in 1991; Ardahan and Iğdır in 1992; Yalova, Karabük and Kilis in 1995; Osmaniye in 1996, and Düzce in 1999.

== List of provinces ==
Below is a list of the 81 provinces of Turkey, sorted according to their license plate codes. Initially, the order of the codes matched the alphabetical order of the province names. After Zonguldak (code 67), the ordering is not alphabetical, but in the order of the creation of provinces, as these provinces were created more recently and thus their plate numbers were assigned after the initial set of codes had been assigned.



== Codes ==
The province&#x27;s ISO code suffix number, the first two digits of the vehicle registration plates of Turkey, and the first digits of the postal codes in Turkey are the same. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) codes are different.

== Defunct provinces ==
* Çatalca, now part of Istanbul Province
* Gelibolu, now part of Çanakkale Province
* İçel (Silifke), now part of Mersin Province

<doc id="428897" wikidata="Q410975" url="?curid=428897" title="U.S. Route 412">
<text>U.S. Route 412 is an east–west United States highway, first commissioned in 1982. U.S. 412 overlaps expressway-grade Cimarron Turnpike from Tulsa west to Interstate 35 and the Cherokee Turnpike from east of Chouteau, Oklahoma, to west of the Arkansas state line. It runs the entire length of the Oklahoma Panhandle and traverses the Missouri Bootheel.

, the highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Columbia, Tennessee at an intersection with Interstate 65, where it continues east as State Route 99. Its western terminus is in Springer, New Mexico at an intersection with Interstate 25.

Even though the number “412” would indicate that U.S. 412 is a spur route of U.S. 12, the two highways never connect because U.S. 12 is much farther north than U.S. 412. Even though U.S. 412 is a three-digit highway, it is still considered part of the double-digit U.S. Highway System.

==Route description==

US 412 overlaps with U.S. 43, U.S. 56, US 60, U.S. 62, U.S. 63, U.S. 64, U.S. 65, I-155, and U.S. 270, runs parallel to U.S. 62 and U.S. 64 in various places and intersects U.S. 70.

===New Mexico===

The highway begins at mile marker 412 of Interstate 25 in Springer. It is concurrent with U.S. Route 56 throughout its entire route in the state at just under . Besides Springer, the only other town Route 412 passes through is Clayton, where it merges with U.S. Route 64. Just before entering Oklahoma, the highway touches the northwestern corner of Texas at a small road junction.

===Oklahoma===

Highway 412 runs across the Panhandle and northern part of the state passing through cities such as Boise City, Woodward, Enid, and Tulsa. Some major highway junctions include Interstate 35 in Noble County and several others in Tulsa such as I-44, 244, 444, and U.S. Routes 75 and 169. Two sections of this highway are tolled: the Cimarron Turnpike (from I-35 to the western outskirts of Tulsa), and the Cherokee Turnpike (from near Chouteau to about west of the Arkansas border).

===Arkansas===

The Arkansas section starts at the Oklahoma line, runs through the scenic Ozark Mountains in the northern part of Arkansas, and leaves the state at the Missouri Bootheel. Cities along the route include Siloam Springs, Springdale, Alpena, Harrison, Cotter, Mountain Home, Salem, Walnut Ridge, and Paragould. In Harrison, U.S. Route 412 is concurrent with both US 62 and US 65.

====Northwest Arkansas====

In the state&#x27;s northwest corner, the route enters Arkansas. In Benton County, the route serves Siloam Springs as a major route through the southern part of the city. US 412 has a concurrency with Highway 59 that ends in east Siloam Springs. US 412 becomes four-lane and runs east to enter Washington County. The route enters Tontitown, passes the historic Tontitown School Building, and intersects Highway 112 before entering Springdale.
US 412 crosses I-49/US 62/US 71 in Springdale, where the route is four-lane with a center left-turn lane. Now named Sunset Avenue, the route passes through developed parts of Springdale, including many restaurants, hotels, and businesses before turning south, forming a concurrency with US 71B. The concurrency ends and US 412 heads east past the Springdale Municipal Airport and Highway 265 out of town. Again becoming four-lane divided, the route winds east to Hindsville.

The route nears Hindsville, including an intersection with a former alignment now designated US 412B. The community was bypassed in 2009 with a four-lane alignment of US 412. US 412 continues east, winding through forested land. Near Huntsville, the highway intersects another business route and Highway 23 before entering Carroll County.

====Concurrencies with US 62 and US 63====

The highway has a brief overlap with Highway 21 in the southwest corner of the county, and has junctions with many rural routes in Carroll County. The highway passes the James C. Chaney House and Stamps Store in Osage, the Dog Branch School, and the Yell Masonic Lodge Hall in Carrollton. In Alpena, US 412 begins a concurrency with US 62. This overlap is approximately through many north central Arkansas communities, including Harrison, Cotter, Mountain Home, Ash Flat, and Hardy. In Imboden, US 412 breaks from US 62 north, now concurrent with US 63 until 2 miles east of Portia.

====Northeast Arkansas====

After the concurrency ends, US 412 runs due east to through downtown Walnut Ridge. US 412 runs near the Old Walnut Ridge Post Office, Missouri-Pacific Depot, and the Walnut Ridge Commercial Historic District, each on the National Register of Historic Places. Further east, the route intersects I-57/US 67 at a full interchange before crossing the Cache River and entering Greene County. Historically, the route passed over the water on the Cache River Bridge, but the 1934 Parker pony truss bridge was bypassed in 1995. The highway runs due east, intersecting Highway 228, Highway 141, and Highway 168 (which gives access to Crowley&#x27;s Ridge State Park) before Paragould. US 412 runs as Kings Hwy in Paragould, passing the Linwood Mausoleum, US 49B, Highway 69, and Highway 135 in the city limits. The route continues east across the St. Francis River, entering Missouri.

===Missouri===

U.S. 412 crosses the Missouri Bootheel, and runs concurrent with Interstate 155 east of Hayti to the Tennessee state line.

===Tennessee===
Still concurrent with I-155, US 412 enters Tennessee from Missouri on the Caruthersville Bridge before meeting US 51 in Dyersburg. The interstate designation ends as 412 turns southeast toward Jackson on a stretch of highway that was upgraded from 2 to 4 lanes in the 1990s. After leaving Jackson on its eastern side, US 412 passes through the towns of Lexington, Parsons, and Hohenwald before reaching Columbia. The section from Hohenwald eastward to I-65 near Columbia is overlapped with unsigned State Route 99. East of I-65 at the eastern terminus of US 412, the route remains SR 99.

==History==
Arkansas Highway 68 is the former designation of U.S. Highway 412 from the Arkansas-Oklahoma State Line to U.S. Highway 62 at Alpena. The original eastern terminus of Highway 68 was east of Huntsville at Highway 21, but was extended in the 1940s to Alpena.

An old alignment of Highway 68 can be found east of Huntsville. This section includes an open-spandrel arch bridge over War Eagle Creek.

Just east of Mountain Home, in Henderson, the highway crosses Lake Norfork, which at one time had to be crossed by ferry. Coinciding with the final trip of a Norfork Lake ferry at 8 a.m. Friday, October 14, 1983, the U.S. Highway 62 bridge across Lake Norfork was opened. Charles Gibson piloted the ferry on that trip, carrying three cars across the lake within the shadow of the bridge, which brought a 40-year era to an end.

==Future==

On May 20, 2021, Senator Jim Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, introduced legislation to designate the portion of US-412 between I-35 in Noble County, Oklahoma and I-49 in Springdale, Arkansas as a future Interstate. The bill, titled the &quot;Future Interstate in Oklahoma and Arkansas Act&quot; (), was cosponsored by senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton, both Republicans of Arkansas. The senators&#x27; stated reasons for seeking an Interstate designation along the US-412 corridor included encouraging economic development, expanding opportunities for employment in the region, making travel safer and shipping easier, attracting new businesses, and better connecting rural and urban communities. Other supporters of the measure include the mayor of Tulsa, G. T. Bynum, and the heads of both the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). In October 2023, officials from both states requested public feedback on the US 412 study area, which is approximately long. Interstate 42 (I-42) was the proposed designation but was withdrawn. ArDOT and ODOT later resubmitted the application to the Spring 2024 meeting; AASHTO approved the route as Interstate 42, conditional on it being upgraded to Interstate standards.

<doc id="428901" wikidata="Q937346" url="?curid=428901" title="Earl of Shrewsbury">
<text>Earl of Shrewsbury () is a hereditary title of nobility created twice in the Peerage of England. The second earldom dates to 1442. The holder of the Earldom of Shrewsbury also holds the title of Earl of Waterford (1446) in the Peerage of Ireland and [[Earl Talbot]] (1784) in the Peerage of Great Britain. Shrewsbury and Waterford are the oldest earldoms in their peerages held by someone with no higher title (the oldest earldoms in each peerage being held by the Duke of Norfolk and Duke of Leinster), and as such the Earl of Shrewsbury is sometimes described as the premier earl of England and Ireland.

==History==
===First creation, 1074===
The first creation occurred in 1074 for Roger de Montgomerie, one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s principal counsellors. He was one of the Marcher Lords, with the Earl of Hereford and the Earl of Chester, a bulwark against the Welsh; he was granted great powers, and his territory, which extended from Shropshire (of which Shrewsbury is the county town) into Mid-Wales (the county of Montgomeryshire being named after him), was outside the ordinary administration; he was also granted lands across England.

Roger was succeeded in 1094 by his younger son Hugh, his elder son Robert of Bellême succeeding to his lands in Normandy. On Hugh&#x27;s death in 1098 the earldom passed to his brother Robert.

The title was forfeit in 1102 after the 3rd Earl, Robert, rebelled against Henry I and joined Robert Curthose&#x27;s invasion of England in 1101.

===Second creation, 1442===
The title was created for a second time in 1442 when John Talbot, 7th Baron Talbot, an English general in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, was made Earl of Shrewsbury in the Peerage of England. He was also made hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland and, in 1446, Earl of Waterford in the Peerage of Ireland (thus, the two titles have always descended together). John Talbot, the first Earl, was succeeded by his son John, the second Earl, who had already succeeded as seventh Baron Furnivall on his mother&#x27;s death in 1433. Lord Shrewsbury served as both Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Lord High Treasurer of England. He was killed at the Battle of Northampton in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses.

His grandson, the fourth Earl, was Lord Steward of the Household between 1509 and 1538. His son, the fifth Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Talbot in 1533, five years before he succeeded his father. On his death the titles passed to his son, the sixth Earl. Lord Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and also served as Earl Marshal from 1572 to 1590. He married as his second wife the famous Bess of Hardwick.

Shrewsbury was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Gertrude Manners, the seventh Earl. He represented Derbyshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. He had no sons and on his death in 1616 the baronies of Talbot, Strange of Blackmere and Furnivall fell into abeyance between his three daughters. He was succeeded in the earldoms by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was Member of Parliament for Northumberland. He did not have a male heir either and was succeeded by his distant relative, the ninth Earl. He was the great-great-grandson of Sir Gilbert Talbot (died 1518), third son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury. The family bought Barlow Woodseats Hall in 1593 as part of the estate.

He was succeeded by his nephew, George, the tenth Earl and Lord of Grafton. He was the son of John Talbot of Grafton. On his death the titles passed to his son, the eleventh Earl. He was killed in a duel with George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. His son, the twelfth Earl, was a prominent statesman. He was one of the Immortal Seven who in 1688 invited William of Orange to invade England and depose his father-in-law James II and later served under William and Mary as Secretary of State for the Southern Department and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. In 1694 he was created Marquess of Alton and Duke of Shrewsbury in the Peerage of England. The Duke was childless and on his death in 1718 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct.

He was succeeded in his other titles by his first cousin, the thirteenth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Gilbert Talbot, second son of the tenth Earl. Lord Shrewsbury was in the Holy Orders of the Church of Rome. On his death the titles passed to his nephew George, the fourteenth Earl (who was the son of the Hon. George Talbot). He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew Charles, the fifteenth Earl (who was the son of Charles Talbot). He began in 1812 the creation of the extensive gardens at Alveton Lodge, Staffordshire (later renamed Alton Towers) which estate had been in the family since the 15th century. When he died the titles were inherited by his nephew John, the sixteenth Earl who was the son of the Hon. John Joseph Talbot. When in 1831 the principal home of the family at Heythrop, Oxfordshire was destroyed by fire he moved the family seat to Alton Towers. The sixteenth Earl was also a noted patron of A W N Pugin. He was succeeded by Bertram, his second cousin once removed, the seventeenth Earl who was the great-grandson of the Hon. George Talbot, younger son of the aforementioned Gilbert Talbot (died 1711), second son of the tenth Earl.

Bertram died unmarried at an early age in 1856. By his will he left his estates to Lord Edmund Howard (by Royal Licence from 1876-1922: Talbot), son of the Duke of Norfolk, a will contested by three distant relatives and after a long and expensive legal case the House of Lords ruled in 1860 in favour of Henry John Chetwynd-Talbot, 3rd Earl Talbot, who thus became the eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. He was a descendant of the aforementioned the Hon. Sir Gilbert Talbot (died 1518), third son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury (see the Earl Talbot for earlier history of this branch). He also held the titles of Baron Talbot, of Hensol in the County of Glamorgan, and Viscount of Ingestre, of Ingestre Hall in the County of Stafford. Lord Shrewsbury was an admiral in the Royal Navy and also served in the second Conservative administration of the Earl of Derby as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (chief whip in the House of Lords) from 1858 to 1859.

His eldest son, the nineteenth Earl, also served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, an office he held from 1874 to 1877 under Benjamin Disraeli. He was succeeded by his son, the twentieth Earl. He caused a scandal in Victorian England by eloping with a married woman, Ellen Miller-Mundy. They were later married. On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the twenty-first Earl. He was the son of Charles John Alton Chetwynd-Talbot, Viscount Ingestre. the peerages are held by the twenty-first Earl&#x27;s eldest son, the twenty-second Earl, who succeeded in 1980. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches. He is also hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland and as the holder of this office is allowed to bear a white staff at the Coronation of the British Monarch.

Lord Shrewsbury is the senior earl on the Roll in the Peerage of England (the more senior earldom of Arundel being held by the Duke of Norfolk). The earldom of Waterford is sometimes called the &quot;Premier Earldom of Ireland &quot;on the Roll&quot;&quot;, as the oldest Irish earldom, that of Kildare, has been a subsidiary title of the Duke of Leinster for centuries and the Earl held the oldest Irish earldom held by anyone ranked as an Earl. If the Viscount Mountgarret proves his presumed claim to the 1328 earldom of Ormonde, the Earls of Shrewsbury would lose this distinction, but they derive higher precedence from their English earldom in any event. Despite holding three differently named earldoms Lord Shrewsbury is always styled simply &quot;The Earl of Shrewsbury&quot;.

The seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury was once Alton Towers until it was sold in 1924 by the infant 21st Earl&#x27;s Trustees. The family seat is still in Staffordshire, near Ashbourne and Uttoxeter.

The family crypt is the Shrewsbury Chapel in Sheffield Cathedral. In 2013, it was discovered that the majority of the Shrewsbury coffins had gone missing from the burial chamber. The current Earl has been appointed High Steward of Sheffield Cathedral. The other family crypt – that of the Chetwynd-Talbot Earls of Shrewsbury – is at the Church of St Mary The Virgin, Ingestre, Stafford.

Three other members of the Talbot family may also be mentioned. The Hon. John Talbot, son of the first Earl of Shrewsbury by his second wife Margaret Beauchamp, was created Viscount Lisle in 1451. Admiral the Hon. Walter Carpenter (who assumed the surname of Carpenter in lieu of his patronymic Chetwynd-Talbot), second son of the eighteenth Earl, was a naval commander and Member of Parliament. Major-General the Hon. Sir Reginald Talbot, third son of the eighteenth Earl, was a soldier, politician and colonial governor.

<text>U.S. Route 425 (US 425) is a north–south United States highway that travels in the U.S. states of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. It was first commissioned in 1989.

The route&#x27;s northern terminus is in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, at an interchange with Interstate 530/U.S. Route 63/U.S. Route 65/U.S. Route 79/US 65B/AR 190. Until 2005, its southern terminus was in Bastrop, Louisiana, at an intersection with U.S. Route 165. In 2005, it was extended to Natchez, Mississippi, at an intersection with U.S. Route 61.

US 425 is an amalgamation of former state highways. Most of US 425 in Louisiana, for example, is merely a concurrency with Louisiana Highway 15 (LA 15).

==Route description==
The route number does not follow the numbering convention for U.S. Highways established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The number should 425 indicate a spur of U.S. Route 25, which is much farther to the east. However, the two routes have never connected.

===Mississippi===
The southern terminus of US 425 is at a signalized intersection with US 61 and US 84 in Natchez. The route travels northwest through the city concurrent with US 84 to the Natchez–Vidalia Bridge, along which the two routes cross the Mississippi River into Louisiana.

===Louisiana===
After entering Louisiana, the concurrency with US 84 continues for approximately 14 miles to Ferriday. US 425 then splits and heads northeast, running concurrently with LA 15 through mostly farmland and small towns. Just north of Clayton is the southern terminus of US 65. Passing through Winnsboro the highways split at Archibald. LA 15 continues northwest to Monroe, LA while US 425 heads north to Rayville where it crosses I-20. At Mer Rouge, it intersects US 165 and the two highways run concurrent to Bastrop, LA. A few miles north of Bastrop, US 425 crosses into Arkansas south of Crossett.

===Arkansas===

The route enters Arkansas near Rawls and runs north through rural Ashley County. Highway 425 forms a concurrency with US 82 east of Crosett, with the two routes running north through farmland and trees to Hamburg, the county seat of Ashley County. In Hamburg, the routes are joined by Highway 8, which runs east and west across the southern part of the state. North of the junction, the three routes pass the First United Methodist Church and historic properties within the Hamburg Commercial Historic District before US 82 turns east at St. Louis Street and US 425/AR 8 run north out of Hamburg. Passing more agricultural land, Highway 8 turns west in Fountain Hill just before the Drew County line.

Further north US 425 intersects Highway 133 in Lacey and Highway 172 before entering Monticello. The highway serves the University of Arkansas at Monticello in the southern part of town, also passing the Monticello Elementary School. US 425 intersects University Drive and continues north as a four–lane road. There is an interchange with Jordan Drive (AR 83S), after which US 425 enters residential Monticello. The route now curves to the west side of town, with Main Street (AR 83) serving downtown Monticello. Highway 83 was the previous alignment of AR 13, which US 425 replaced upon designation in 1989. There are plans to bypass Monticello even more efficiently as part of Interstate 69&#x27;s extension into Arkansas.

US 425, now four–lane with center turn lane format, intersects US 278/Highway 35 at a busy intersection. Highway 35 forms a short concurrency north with US 425, which proceeds north and out of Monticello. After AR 35 turns west, Highway 425 has many rural junctions with county routes. Upon entering Lincoln County, the route passes the historic Mt. Zion Presbyterian Church in Relfs Bluff and the Parker House before entering Star City. Downtown, the highway forms a concurrency with Highway 11, which ends near the Lincoln County Courthouse and the Star City Commercial Historic District. The highway continues north through rural areas before intersecting US 65 in Jefferson County. US 65/US 425 run concurrent west to a high–volume interchange with I-530/US 63/US 79/US 65B/AR 190, where US 425 terminates.

==History==
In Arkansas, US 425 replaced the southern half of Arkansas Highway 13, which was an original state highway in the area. The route is essentially the same as it was at inception in the 1926 state highway plan, connecting the major cities in its area of southeast Arkansas. Highway 13 now runs in north central Arkansas. Most of US Route 425 was repaved in 2010 within Ashley County.

===Louisiana Highway 137===

Louisiana Highway 137 (LA 137) was a state highway in Louisiana that serves Richland Parish and Morehouse Parish. It spanned in a south to north direction. LA 137 is now signed as U.S. 425 for its entire length.

From the south, LA 137 began as a state highway at an intersection with LA 15 north of Mangham in the small town of Archibald. It went north and intersected LA 584 before intersecting LA 135.

Passing under I-20, LA 137 met LA 3048 in the town of Rayville. After intersecting US 80, LA 137 entered Morehouse Parish, continuing north as a two-lane road until it swapped the U.S. 425 designation with LA 133.

LA 137 is a divided, four-lane highway south of Rayville, a pair of two one-way roads inside of Rayville, and an undivided, two-lane road north of Rayville. Before the 1955 renumbering, LA 137 was State Route 47 from Archibald to Rayville. The current routing for LA 137 did not exist, and travelers had to take US 80 west, then State Route 47 (Current LA 133) to Oak Ridge.

LA 137 was removed from the state highway system in 2005, when US 425 was extended south to Mississippi. It is still signed, however, as LA 137 and US 425.

<text>Pukekohe is a town in the Auckland Region of the North Island of New Zealand. Located at the southern edge of the Auckland Region, between the southern shore of the Manukau Harbour and the mouth of the Waikato River. The hills of Pukekohe and nearby Bombay Hills form the natural southern limit of the Auckland region. Pukekohe is located within the political boundaries of the Auckland Council, following the abolition of the Franklin District Council on 1 November 2010.

With a population of Pukekohe is the 24th largest urban area in New Zealand, and the third largest in the Auckland Region behind Auckland itself and Hibiscus Coast.

== Geology ==

Pukekohe and the surrounding areas are a section of the South Auckland volcanic field, which erupted between 550,000 and 1,600,000 years ago.

==History==
===Māori history===

Tāmaki Māori peoples settled the wider area in the 13th or 14th centuries. The traditional Māori name for Pukekohe Hill, &quot;Pukekohekohe&quot; (&quot;Hill of Kohekohe&quot;) refers to &quot;Dysoxylum spectabile&quot;, also known as the New Zealand mahogany tree, which used to be a prominent part of the native bush on in the area. The area was important to Waiohua tribes including Ngāti Tamaoho, Ngāti Te Ata and Te Ākitai, due to the strategic views from the hill and the high quality soil. The northern slopes of the hill were home to some of the largest croplands (&quot;māra kai&quot;) for the Tāmaki Māori people who settled here.

Much of the population around Pukekohe migrated south during the Musket Wars in the 1820s due to the threat from Ngāpuhi and other northern tribes, gradually returning from the mid-1830s.

In modern times, the two main iwi of the area are Ngāti Tamaoho and Ngāti Te Ata. Waikato Tainui has a strong presence.

===European settlement and the New Zealand Wars===
The Crown purchased the Pukekohe block on 7 December 1843, for £150 in cash and £170 worth of goods The Crown established Te Awa nui o Taikehu, a reserve the Crown created for Te Ākitai Waiohua during land sales around modern-day Pukekohe. Some of this land was accidentally sold to settlers. The Crown would compensate the settlers and return land to local iwi. By 1856, European settlements had been well established in the north and western reaches of Pukekohe. On 9 July 1863, due to fears of the Māori King Movement, Governor George Grey proclaimed that all Māori living to the South of Auckland needed to swear loyalty to the Queen and give up their weapons. Most people refused due to strong links to Tainui, leaving for the south before the Government&#x27;s Invasion of the Waikato. Small numbers of people remained, in order to tend to their farms and for ahi kā (land rights through continued occupation).

A major battle of the Waikato War was fought at Pukekohe East on 14 September 1863. The battle involved 11 armed settlers, who were converting the Pukekohe East church into a redoubt and approximately 200–300 Māori, mainly from the Waikato area. Although surprised and severely outnumbered, the settlers held off the Māori war party until troops from the 18th Royal Irish Regiment arrived. No settlers were killed or injured while 30 Māori were killed with an unknown number wounded. 6 bodies were found near the church and 24 were later found buried in the bush. The church still exists today and the bullet holes are still visible. According to Te Huia Raureti, tribes that took part in the raid came from Ngāti Maniapoto, some other upper Waikato tribes, and Ngāti Pou of lower Waikato. On the even of the raid on Pukekohe East, a war council had ordered members of the taua (war party) to avoid looting the property of settlers. Despite this order, future Ngāti Maniapoto chief Wahanui Huatare and several other members raided a settler&#x27;s house. This angered other members of the war party, who regarded it as a bad omen. Nearly the entire Pukekohe area was abandoned apart from military outposts. Isolated attacks occurred as late as November 1863 after the Battle of Rangiriri.

The New Zealand Government confiscated large tracts of land in the aftermath of the invasion in 1865, after which the town of Pukekohe was established, on the northern slopes of its namesake, Pukekohe Hill. In January 1865, the New Zealand Government&#x27;s Executive Council designated Pukekohe as one of the eight districts in the Waikato region to be confiscated, which amounted to a total of 577,590 acres. On 26 April 1865, the Native Land Court awarded £5,444 in compensation to the Ngatipari tribe, a branch of the Ākitai people, for a block of land known as the &quot;Pukekohe Reserve&quot; or &quot;Pukekohe bloc,&quot; which had been confiscated during the Waikato War. The Ngatipari claimants successfully argued that they had not opposed the Crown during the Waikato War and established their claim to the land on the basis of cultivation and ancestral burial grounds.

Following the Waikato War the government wished to populate the area around Pukekohe. To do this they offered migrants from Britain and Cape Colony 10 and 5 acres respectively to settle in the area. Over 3,000 immigrants came from Britain and roughly 1,200 from Cape Colony. In 1864, about 1,000 Irish Protestants arrived in Pukekohe as part of a wave of Irish Protestant migrants settling in the North Island during the mid to late 19th century.

Due to the clearing of dense bush in the Pukekohe area, large areas of fertile, volcanic land became available for growing crops. While onions and potatoes were first grown in Pukekohe as early as the 1850s, large-scale market growing of vegetables did not begin until 1870 in nearby Patumahoe. After horticulturalist John Bilkey planted a successful crop of onions on Pukekohe Hill in 1892, local farmers began cultivating onion patches. The expansion of roads and railway infrastructure during the late 19th century led to the development of market gardens in Pukekohe and the nearby Bombay Hills. By 1875, Pukekohe was connected to Auckland by rail with the extension of railway lines to Mercer. This is when Pukekohe&#x27;s population saw the largest growth. People who had lived in Te Awa nui o Taikehu returned to the area in the 1870s, often working as labourers in the market gardens on the former lands of the reserve. By 1885 Pukekohe had 145 farmers, all the expected professionals of a small town, and several businesses.

===20th century===

During the early 20th century, several landless Māori from the Waikato migrated to Pukekohe to work in the township&#x27;s market gardens as itinerant agricultural workers. These Māori came from the Ngatipari, Ākitai, and Ngāpuhi iwi (tribes). Since the Māori in Pukekohe had no ancestral ties to the land, they took the symbolic title of rootless Māori and became known as &quot;Nga Hau E Wha&quot; (People of the Four Winds).

On 10 June 1905, Pukekohe became a town district. By 1907, Pukekohe&#x27;s town centre consisted of one main street with numerous stores and workshops. Following the completion of the North Island Main Trunk railway line in 1907, Pukekohe&#x27;s market gardens became a major supplier of agricultural produce for several North Island major population centres including Auckland and Wellington. Due to Auckland&#x27;s growing population, Pukekohe became an important market gardening area for the Auckland Region. On 1 April 1912, Pukekohe became a borough with its own elected local council. Due to Auckland&#x27;s growing population during the 19th and 20th centuries, Pukekohe became an important market gardening area for the Auckland Region. Mitha Unka, the first Indian settler, arrived in Pukekohe in 1918, and an Indian community developed in the town during the 1930s and 1940s. By July 1921, a beautifying society had been established in Pukekohe.

The growing presence of Chinese and Indian market growers in Pukekohe led to the creation of the White New Zealand League in December 1925. In 1932, 1,400 Pukekohe locals petitioned the New Zealand Parliament to repatriate local Chinese and Indians, who they claimed were taking jobs from Europeans and Māori. Parliament dismissed the petition in 1934 on the grounds that the petition&#x27;s allegations had not been proved. Local Indians also formed the Pukekohe Indian Association.

During the 1930s, another wave of Māori rural-to-urban migration occurred in the Auckland Region including Pukekohe. Many Māori migrating to Pukekohe and Auckland found it difficult to secure housing due to discrimination from landlords, with many experiencing substandard housing. On 15 July 1935, the &quot;Franklin Times&quot; reported that the poor living conditions of Maori in Pukekohe contributed to a high Maori child mortality rate, with the newspaper estimating an upward of 20 dying. The Pukekohe council later petitioned the New Zealand government to address the substandard living conditions of Māori market garden workers and their families. During the early 1940s, the Department of Māori Affairs launched a scheme to build houses for Māori workers and their families. However, the project was aborted when the Pukekohe council object to Māori living within the town&#x27;s boundaries.

Between 1942 and 1944, Pukekohe hosted US Marines, US Army and US Navy personnel serving in the Pacific theatre of World War Two. During World War Two, the public mobilisation for the war effort led to the emergence of girls&#x27; marching clubs and a Boy&#x27;s Brigade company. Pukekohe also hosted the annual Franklin Caledonian Society&#x27;s sports day in February 1945.

In 1952, the Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League undertook a house-to-house survey of living conditions in Pukekohe, where Māori worked as agricultural works on the market gardens and lived in substandard shacks provided by their employers. The League submitted its report to the Auckland City Council, the Department of Māori Affairs, and the State Advances Corporation. Despite the League&#x27;s lobbying, many Māori continued to face substandard living conditions and long waits for state rental housing. Until the 1950s, many Māori children in Pukekohe died from poverty-related illnesses such as typhoid.

In 1952, the Department of Education established a segregated special Māori school in Pukekohe in response to strong local pressure from European residents who did not want their children to mix with Māori. This contradicted the department&#x27;s policy of racially integrated schools. The visiting American psychologist David Ausubel regarded Pukekohe&#x27;s segregated school as emblematic of an alleged &quot;colour bar&quot; in New Zealand where Māori faced negative stereotyping and discrimination in accessing housing, hotel accommodation, employment, and credit services.

In 1963, ethnic Chinese onion grower Rai Wai Ching contested a seat in the New Zealand Parliament to highlight racism in Pukekohe. At candidates&#x27; meetings, he complained that members of his community were not served in bars and were allocated inferior seats at the town&#x27;s cinemas. Ching faced death threats and was given police protection. Though Ching&#x27;s parliamentary bid was unsuccessful, the publicity led the town to end discrimination against non-Whites in hotels and cinemas.

==Culture==
===Marae===
Ngā Hau e Whā Marae is located in the Pukekohe area. It is the tribal meeting grounds of Ngāti Tamaoho and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāi Tai and Ngāti Tamaoho.

===Indian community centres===

In 1953, the Nehru Hall was constructed in Pukekohe for the Indian committee, and was the first Indian community hall to be built in New Zealand. The hall was too small to host large-scale events such as Indian weddings, which instead were held at the Pukekohe War Memorial Town Hall. In response to the community needing a larger space, the PIA Events Centre was opened by the Pukekohe Indian Association in 1999.

==Demographics==

<text>William Michael Griffin Jr. (born January 28, 1968), better known by his stage name Rakim (), is an American rapper. He is one half of golden age hip hop duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim, with whom he released four albums: &quot;Paid in Full&quot; (1987), &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (1988), &quot;Let the Rhythm Hit &#x27;Em&quot; (1990), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Sweat the Technique&quot; (1992). He also released four solo albums: &quot;The 18th Letter&quot; (1997), &quot;The Master&quot; (1999), &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (2009), and &quot;G.O.D.&#x27;s Network: Reb7rth&quot; (2024).

Rakim is considered a transformative figure in hip hop for raising the bar for MC technique higher than it had ever been. Rakim helped to pioneer the use of internal rhymes and multisyllabic rhymes, and he was among the first to demonstrate the possibilities of sitting down to write intricately crafted lyrics packed with clever word choices and metaphors rather than the more improvisational styles and simpler rhyme patterns that predominated before him. Rakim is also credited with creating the overall shift from the more simplistic old school flows to more complex flows. Rapper Kool Moe Dee explained that before Rakim, the term &#x27;flow&#x27; wasn&#x27;t widely used – &quot;Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along. It was called rhyming, it was called cadence, but it wasn&#x27;t called flow. Rakim created flow!&quot;

&quot;Paid in Full&quot; was named the greatest hip hop album of all time by MTV in 2006, while Rakim himself was ranked No. 4 on MTV&#x27;s list of the Greatest MCs of All Time. Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that &quot;Rakim is near-universally acknowledged as one of the greatest MCs – perhaps &quot;the&quot; greatest – of all time within the hip-hop community&quot;. The editors of About.com ranked him No. 2 on their list of the &#x27;Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)&#x27;. In 2012, &quot;The Source&quot; ranked him No. 1 on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Lyricists of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==
William Michael Griffin Jr. was born on January 28, 1968, in Wyandanch, New York. He is the nephew of the late R&amp;B singer and actress Ruth Brown. He grew up in Wyandanch on Long Island and wrote his first rhyme at seven years old, about the cartoon character Mickey Mouse. He initially aspired to play professional football, and was a quarterback on his high school football team.

However, after being introduced to local DJ Eric B. by his friend Alvin Toney, he began writing lyrics to fit Eric&#x27;s instrumentals and chose instead to focus on a career in music. Then known as Kid Wizard, he made his first recordings live at Wyandanch High School in the year 1985.

Rakim was initially introduced to the Nation of Islam in 1986; he later joined The Nation of Gods and Earths (also known as the 5 Percent Nation) and adopted the Arabic name Rakim Allah. He also chose to use “Rakim Allah” as his stage name, although it was most often shortened to simply “Rakim”. During his career he has been nicknamed the &quot;God MC&quot; because of his acclaimed status as an MC and a reference to the &quot;Allah&quot; in his stage name, which is the Arabic word for God.

==Career==
===Pairing with Eric B. (1985–1992)===

First meeting in 1985, Eric B. and Rakim went on to release four studio albums before their separation in 1992. The duo were described by journalist Tom Terrell of NPR as &quot;the most influential DJ/MC combo in contemporary pop music period&quot;, while the editors of About.com ranked them as No. 4 on their list of the 10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time. They were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011, although they did not make the final selection.

==== 1986–87: Beginnings and classic debut ====
After Rakim responded to Eric B.&#x27;s search for &quot;New York&#x27;s top MC&quot;, Eric B.&#x27;s friend and roommate Marley Marl allowed them to use his home studio. The first tracks they recorded—&quot;Eric B. Is President&quot; and &quot;My Melody&quot;—were released as a single/b-side on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons heard the single, the duo were signed to Island Records and began recording the album in Manhattan&#x27;s Power Play Studios in early 1987.

On July 7, 1987, the duo released their debut album, &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, on the Island-subsidiary label 4th &amp; B&#x27;way Records. The album peaked at No. 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and produced five singles: &quot;Eric B. Is President&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Joke&quot;, &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot;, &quot;Move the Crowd&quot;, and &quot;Paid in Full&quot;.

====1988–89: Sophomore peak====
While its singles attained moderate success, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; performed better on music charts than Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s debut album and reached number 22 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. Released during hip hop&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;, the album was well received by critics and has since been recognized by music writers as one of the most groundbreaking and influential hip hop albums of all time. American author William Jelani Cobb wrote of the album&#x27;s significance, &quot;On the heels of &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, Eric B. &amp; Rakim delivered a full clip of album titled &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; in 1988. Featuring a broader spectrum of sounds than the James Brown samples that had defined the initial release, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; saw Rakim at his most lyrically fierce, issuing deft and death threats on such tracks as &#x27;Microphone Fiend,&#x27; &#x27;Lyrics of Fury,&#x27; and the nearly felonious &#x27;No Competition.&#x27; The release marked the high point in the collaboration between the two and prefaced the long slide they faced in the 1990s.&quot;

==== 1990–92: Final albums and dissolution ====
&quot;Let the Rhythm Hit &#x27;Em&quot;, released in 1990, was Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s third album. This album saw the duo&#x27;s sound develop further, with Rakim adopting a deeper, more aggressive tone of voice, as well as more mature and serious subject matter. Musically, the production ranges from smoother soulful tracks such as &quot;In the Ghetto&quot; to the hard-edged assault of the title track. Though it could not support singles as popular as the duo&#x27;s previous albums, it is considered by many to be the duo&#x27;s most coherent album. It is one of the few albums to have received a &quot;five-mic&quot; rating from &quot;The Source&quot;. In 1998, the album was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s 100 Best Rap Albums. The back cover features a dedication to the memories of Rakim&#x27;s father William and producer Paul C., who had worked on many of the album&#x27;s tracks before his murder in July 1989. His protégé Large Professor completed his work. Neither receive credit in the album&#x27;s notes.

In 1992, Eric B &amp; Rakim released their fourth and final album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Sweat the Technique&quot;. The title track was a minor radio hit. &quot;Casualties of War&quot; was also released as a single. &quot;Know the Ledge&quot; first appeared in the film &quot;Juice&quot; under the title &quot;Juice (Know the Ledge)&quot;. However, Eric B. refused to sign MCA&#x27;s release contract, fearful that Rakim would abandon him. This led to a long, complicated court battle involving the two musicians and MCA. The legal wrangling eventually led to the duo dissolving completely.

===Solo-career (1993–present)===

====1993–2003: Legal issues, solo debut, and Aftermath stint====

After breaking up his partnership with Eric B. in early-1993, Rakim kept a low profile, only making one notable appearance on the soundtrack to the 1993 film &quot;Gunmen&quot;. A reshuffling in MCA caused Rakim to be dropped from the label in 1994. As Rakim continued to struggle with legal problems, he secured a deal with Universal Records and began recording his solo debut album &quot;The 18th Letter&quot; in 1996. In November 1997, the album &quot;The 18th Letter&quot; was released. Expectations were high for Rakim, as the album debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA.

In June 1999, Rakim appeared on three tracks of &quot;The Seduction of Claude Debussy&quot; by Art of Noise. AllMusic&#x27;s Keith Farley notes that &quot;the album charts the artistic use of sampled breakbeats – pioneered by the Art of Noise themselves – with nods to &#x27;80s hip-hop plus their &#x27;90s equivalent, drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass.&quot;

In November 1999, Rakim released &quot;The Master&quot;, which received good reviews but sold poorly.

Rakim was signed to Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment record label in 2000, for work on an album tentatively titled &quot;Oh, My God&quot;. The album underwent numerous changes in artistic direction and personnel and was delayed several times. While working on the album, Rakim made guest appearances on four Aftermath projects, including the hit single &quot;Addictive&quot; by Truth Hurts and its remix (which featured a different Rakim verse from the main version), the Dr. Dre-produced &quot;The Watcher Part 2&quot; by Jay-Z, and Eminem&#x27;s &quot;8 Mile&quot; soundtrack album with the track &quot;R.A.K.I.M&quot;.

However, Rakim left the label in 2003 and &quot;Oh, My God&quot; was indefinitely shelved. After Rakim eventually left Aftermath Entertainment, he stated that the reason he departed the label was because of creative differences with Dr. Dre. Discussing the period later, Rakim discussed how he was seeking to write conscious material, while Dr. Dre was encouraging him to pursue gangsta rap narratives instead.

====2007–2009: &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;====
Rakim retreated to his Connecticut estate to work leisurely on music. Not having released an album since 1999, he eschewed touring in favor of infrequent gigs. Rakim was able to retain the tracks he had made with Dr. Dre and, in 2006, announced that he would release a new studio album, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. The album was delayed into 2009; instead, he followed up with a live album, &quot;The Archive: Live, Lost &amp; Found&quot;, in 2008. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2007, when asked about story behind &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;″s title, Rakim said,

In another interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2009, he stated,
&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; was released on November 17, 2009, after several delays on Rakim&#x27;s own Ra Records, TVM, and SMC Recordings and distributed through Fontana and Universal Music Group. Considered a comeback album after a ten-year gap between releases, the album features the two singles: &quot;Holy Are You&quot;, which was released on July 14, 2009, and &quot;Walk These Streets&quot; which was released on October 7, 2009. It features production from several renowned hip hop artists, including Nottz, J. Wells, Needlz, Jake One, and Nick Wiz. The album sold 12,000 copies in the United States by November 22, 2009, according to SoundScan. Upon its release, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; received generally mixed or average reviews from most music critics; it holds an aggregate score of 59/100 at Metacritic.

====2011–present: Reunion with Eric B. and &quot;G.O.D.&#x27;s Network: Reb7rth&quot;====
In 2011, Rakim performed &quot;Paid in Full&quot; in its entirety at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City, in honor of the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. He was backed by The Roots.

In 2012, Rakim announced that he and Eric B. would release a 25th anniversary edition of their 1987 album &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, which would contain new tracks recorded by Eric B. &amp; Rakim, by the end of 2012; Rakim announced he would release a new solo album by the end of 2012. He performed at the annual Roots&#x27; Picnic in Philadelphia in June. In an interview with &quot;The Detroit Free Press&quot; he announced he was in the studio with Pharrell Williams working on a new album set to be released in 2013, saying the first single will be released before the end of the year.

On September 24, 2013, he released a collaborative single with DMX entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me&quot;.

In 2014, Rakim is featured on the collaborative single with American rock band Linkin Park, titled &quot;Guilty All the Same&quot;. The song was released on March 6, 2014, by Warner Bros. Records as the first single from their sixth studio album, titled &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;. He contributed his rhymes during the bridge for the main version of the song; however, he is not featured on the radio edit of the song. The song was officially released on March 7, 2014, for digital download.

On April 27, 2015, Rakim announced he was working on a new album and planned to release it in the middle or end of 2015. He said &quot;This is one of those albums where I can have fun. My last album, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, was somewhat of a conscious album. I wanted to make a statement on that album.&quot;

On October 20, 2016, it was announced via Twitter that Rakim had reunited with Eric B. after 23 years. The duo teased a potential reunion tour the next morning, hosting a poll for the fans to give their opinion on what city Eric B. &amp; Rakim should start the tour. Four locations were the potential candidates: New York City, Las Vegas, London, and Australia. Since the announcement of the reunion, fans have speculated if the two will drop a new studio album in the near future.

In late-June 2018, a new song, &quot;King&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, was released on &quot;Luke Cage: Season 2 (Original Soundtrack Album)&quot;. Rakim performed the song for the first time on NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concerts series along with former A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad and producer Adrian Younge.

In May 2024, Masta Killa teased an image of Rakim, Kurupt and himself with the upcoming release of a single on June 21, 2024 titled &quot;Be Ill&quot;. Two weeks later, it was announced that Rakim&#x27;s fourth studio album would be titled &quot;G.O.D.&#x27;s Network: Reb7rth&quot;, and would be fully produced by Rakim himself. The limited special edition of the album has been announced to feature artists such as Nipsey Hussle, Snoop Dogg, Planet Asia and Kobe. On May 29, 2024, Rakim posted a video of a potential video shoot of the new single on his Instagram. &quot;G.O.D.&#x27;s Network: Reb7rth&quot; was released on July 26, 2024.

==Artistry==
Rakim&#x27;s rhyming deviated from the simple rhyme patterns of early 1980s hip hop. His free-rhythm style ignored bar lines and had earned comparisons to jazz pianist Thelonious Monk. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Ben Ratliff wrote that Rakim&#x27;s &quot;unblustery rapping developed the form beyond the flat-footed rhythms of schoolyard rhymes&quot;. While many rappers developed their technique through improvisation, Rakim was one of the first to demonstrate advantages of a writerly style, as with for instance his pioneering use of internal rhymes and multisyllabic rhymes. Unlike previous rappers such as LL Cool J, KRS-One, and Run-D.M.C., who delivered their vocals with high energy, Rakim employed a relaxed, stoic delivery. According to MTV, &quot;We&#x27;d been used to MCs like Run and DMC, Chuck D and KRS-One leaping on the mic shouting with energy and irreverence, but Rakim took a methodical approach to his microphone fiending. He had a slow flow, and every line was blunt, mesmeric.&quot; Rakim&#x27;s relaxed delivery results from his jazz influences; he had played the saxophone and was a John Coltrane fan.

Artists and critics often credit Rakim with creating the overall shift from the more simplistic old school flows to more complex flows. Kool Moe Dee says, &quot;any emcee that came after 1986 had to study Rakim just to know what to be able to do. [...] Rakim, in 1986, gave us flow and that was the rhyme style from 1986 to 1994. [...] From that point on, anybody emceeing was forced to focus on their flow.&quot; Kool Moe Dee explains that before Rakim, the term &#x27;flow&#x27; wasn&#x27;t widely used – &quot;Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along. It was called rhyming, it was called cadence, but it wasn&#x27;t called flow. Rakim created flow!&quot; He adds that while Rakim upgraded and popularized the focus on flow, &quot;he didn&#x27;t invent the word&quot;.

Rakim&#x27;s subject matter often covered his own rapping skills and lyrical superiority over other rappers. AllMusic editor Steve Huey comments that &quot;the majority of his lyrics concern his own skills and his Islamic faith.&quot; He also notes Rakim for his &quot;complex internal rhymes, compounding, literate imagery, velvet-smooth flow, and unpredictable, off-the-beat rhythms.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Jess Harvell described his rapping as &quot;authoritative, burnished, [and] possessing an unflappable sense of rhythm&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Paid in Full&quot; was released during the period that became known as golden age hip hop. Alex Ogg considered it the duo&#x27;s magnum opus in his book &quot;The Men Behind Def Jam&quot;. Rakim&#x27;s rapping set a blueprint for future rappers and helped secure East Coast hip hop&#x27;s reputation for innovative lyrical technique. William Jelani Cobb stated in his book &quot;To the Break of Dawn&quot; that his rapping had &quot;stepped outside&quot; of the preceding era of old school hip hop and that while the vocabulary and lyrical dexterity of newer rappers had improved, it was &quot;nowhere near what Rakim introduced to the genre&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Dimitri Ehrlich, who described the album as &quot;an artistic and commercial benchmark&quot;, credited Rakim for helping &quot;give birth to a musical genre&quot; and leading &quot;a quiet musical revolution, introducing a soft-spoken rapping style&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Steve Huey declared &quot;Paid in Full&quot; one of hip hop&#x27;s most influential albums and &quot;essential listening&quot; for those interested in the genre&#x27;s &quot;basic musical foundations&quot;. MTV ranked it at number one in &quot;The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time&quot;, stating it raised the standards of hip hop &quot;both sonically and poetically&quot; and described it as &quot;captivating, profound, innovative and instantly influential&quot;. The album is broken down track-by-track by Rakim in Brian Coleman&#x27;s book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed it at number 227 on &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, calling it &quot;Ice-grilled, laid-back, diamond-sharp: Rakim is a front-runner in the race for Best Rapper Ever, and this album is a big reason why.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Blender&quot; magazine included the album in its &quot;500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed it as one of the eighteen albums of the 1980s in its &quot;All-TIME 100&quot; albums; editor Alan Light acknowledged the record for changing the &quot;sound, flow, and potential&quot; of hip hop and that if Rakim is &quot;the greatest MC of all time, as many argue, this album is the evidence&quot;.

Jess Harvell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; complimented Rakim for an &quot;endless display of pure skill&quot; and described the album as &quot;laidback and funky&quot;, but believed it contained &quot;too much filler to get a free &#x27;classic&#x27; pass&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Paid in Full&quot; at number fifty-two in its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot;; editor Sam Chennault wrote that Rakim inspired a generation of MCs and &quot;defined what it meant to be a hip-hop lyricist&quot;. The rappers who have used the unique rapping style employed by Rakim and attribute it as inspiration include GZA, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon (from the Wu-Tang Clan), Tupac, Nas, Kool G. Rap, Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, 50 Cent, Cordae and many more. On July 11, 1995, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum. As of December 1997, it has sold over a million copies.

<text>Cividale del Friuli (, locally ; ; ) is a town and (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Udine, part of the North-Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The town lies above sea-level in the foothills of the eastern Alps, by rail from the city of Udine and close to the Slovenian border. It is situated on the river Natisone, which forms a picturesque ravine here. Formerly an important regional power, it is today a quiet, small town that attracts tourists thanks to its medieval center.

==History==

Archaeological findings reveal that the area was already inhabited in Paleolithic and Neolithic times. During the Iron Age the region was settled by Veneti and Celts. Due to the location&#x27;s strategic position on the northeastern frontier of Roman Italy, in 50 BC, the Romans founded there a &quot;castrum&quot;, which afterwards was transformed by Julius Caesar into a &quot;forum&quot; and its name changed into Forum Iulii (&quot;Julius&#x27; marketplace&quot;; Fréjus had the same Roman name). Not long afterward, the &quot;forum&quot; became a &quot;municipium&quot; and its citizens were inscribed in the Roman tribe &quot;Scaptia&quot;.

After the destruction of Aquileia and Iulium Carnicum (Zuglio) in 452 AD, Forum Iulii became the chief town of the district of Friuli and gave its name to it.

In 568 the city was the first major centre occupied by Alboin&#x27;s Lombard invasion of Italy, then part of the Byzantine Empire. The city was chosen as first capital of the newly formed Lombard Kingdom, then granted by Alboin to his nephew Gisulf as the capital of a Lombard Duchy of Friuli. After the Lombards were defeated by the Franks, (774), following the last Lombard resistance under Hrodgaud of Friuli (776) Forum Julii changed its name to &quot;Civitas Austriae&quot;, Charlemagne&#x27;s Italian &quot;City of the East&quot;.

Under the Carolingian settlement with the Papacy, the patriarchs of Aquileia resided here from 773 to 1031, when they returned to Aquileia, and finally in 1238 removed to Udine. This last change of residence was the origin of the antagonism between Cividale and Udine, which was only terminated by their surrender to Venice in 1419 and 1420 respectively.
When the Patriarchal State of Friuli was founded in 1077, Cividale was chosen as the capital.

According to James Burke, a 1331 siege of Cividale was one of the first deployments of what we would now call cannons, in the early form known as a bombard.

Between July and September 1409, a church council was held at Cividale by Pope Gregory XII (Roman Obedience). It was poorly attended and achieved nothing.

In 1420 Cividale was annexed to the Republic of Venice.

After the Napoleonic Wars Cividale became part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. It was ceded to Kingdom of Italy in 1866.

==Main sights==

The historical center of the town is dominated by Piazza del Duomo, which is where the National Archaeological Museum of Cividale del Friuli is located. Close by is the &quot;Palazzo dei Provveditori Veneti&quot;, constructed in 1565 and designed by Andrea Palladio. The town is split in two by the Natisone River, which is spanned by the Devil&#x27;s Bridge (15th century, rebuilt in 1918). The Celtic Hypogeum is a subterranean series of halls carved in the rock in ancient times, whose destination remains unclear: uses as either Celtic funerary monument or a Roman (Lombard) jail has been proposed.

The Cathedral (&quot;Duomo&quot;) was built in the 15th century over a pre-existing construction built in the 8th century. It is a Venetian Gothic building, finished in the 16th century by architect Pietro Lombardo, featuring interventions from the 18th century also. The interior houses an altar dedicated to the Madonna, in the right aisle, and the altarpiece of patriarch Pellegrino II (1195−1204), a silver retable which had been inscribed in Latin by the means of individual letter punches, 250 years before the invention of modern movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg.

The Christian Museum annexed to the Duomo houses outstanding examples of Lombard sculpture.
It contains some interesting relics of the art of the 8th century. The cathedral contains an octagonal marble canopy with sculptures in relief, with a font below it belonging to the 8th century, but altered later. The high altar has a fine silver altar front of 1185. The museum contains various Roman and Lombard antiquities, and works of art in gold, silver and ivory formerly belonging to the cathedral chapter. The fine 15th-century Ponte del Diavolo leads to the church of S. Martino, which contains an altar of the 8th century with reliefs executed by order of the Lombard king Ratchis.

The small church of &quot;Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle&quot; (also known as Lombard Temple), next to the Natisone river, is a notable example of High Middle Ages art sometimes attributed to the 8th century, but probably later. Included in the old Lombard quarter, it was probably used as Palatine Chapel by the Lombard dukes and king&#x27;s functionaries. The fine decorations, statues and stuccoes (11th or 12th century) housed in the interior, show a strong Byzantine influence.

In the collegiata, the altarpiece of Pellegrinus II (1195−1204) is a silver retable which had been inscribed in Latin by the means of individual letter punches, 250 years before the invention of modern movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg.

On 25 June 2011 a part of the historical centre of Cividale (the one belonging to the Lombards era) entered the UNESCO heritage list.

==Tradition and Folklore==
On 6 January residents celebrate the Messa dello Spadone (Mass of the Broadsword), a religious rite observed with an historical reenactment of Patriarch Marquard of Randeck’s arrival in Cividale in 1366.

=== Game of Truc ===
The game of Truc is an old game played by children and adults on Easter and the Monday following Easter (called Pasquetta, or Little Easter). A manuscript preserved in the National Archaeology Museum of Cividale del Friuli traces the game back to the 18th century. While Truc is exclusive to the central squares of Cividale, a similar game is played in Venice and in Emilia Romagna (Italy). An Easter game played in Lusatia (Germany) called &quot;Waleien&quot; also has similar rules to Truc.

The game takes place in a large, round basin made of sand with a ramp leading into it. Players roll colored hard-boiled eggs and, according to precise rules, aim to touch the other eggs rolled into the basin for a number of points. The game’s name is an onomatopoeia imitating the sound the eggs make when they touch.

==Other attractions==
The town has a number of small osterias which serve distinctive local wines. Of particular note are &quot;Tocai friulano&quot;, &quot;Verduzzo&quot; and &quot;Refosco dal peduncolo rosso&quot;.

==Transport==
The town is easily accessible by rail and bus from Udine and by bus from Gorizia.

<text>HMS &quot;Erne&quot;, pennant number U03, was a sloop in the Royal Navy. She was laid down by Furness Shipbuilding at Haverton Hill-on-Tees, Co. Durham on 21 September 1939, launched on 5 August 1940 and commissioned on 3 April 1941. She was adopted by the district of Bootle, then in Lancashire, as part of Warship Week in 1942.

She took her name like others in her class from birds, in this case a white-tailed eagle, also known as the erne.

==Service history==

On 30 April 1941, while &quot;Erne&quot; was still at the builders yard (4 days after commissioning), a near miss during a German air attack caused heavy damage. Repairs took until June 1942.

On 31 July 1942, depth charges from the three British sloops &quot;Erne&quot;, and sank the in the North Atlantic east of the Azores, in position 36º45&#x27;N, 22º50&#x27;W.

On 29 August 1942, &quot;Erne&quot;, scuttled the Dutch merchant &quot;Zuiderkerk&quot; with depth charges. The had torpedoed &quot;Zuiderkerk&quot; west-north-west of Lisbon, Portugal in position 40º20&#x27;N, 16º02&#x27;W. A torpedo had caused extensive flooding of the forward holds, which forced the 56 crew members and twelve passengers to abandon ship in the early morning. picked up the survivors.

==Fate==

&quot;Erne&quot; was reduced to a drill ship on 4 June 1952 and renamed &quot;Wessex&quot;. In 1965 she was sold for scrap and arrived at Antwerp on 27 October 1965 where she was broken up.

<doc id="428912" wikidata="Q257973" url="?curid=428912" title="ANZAC Mounted Division">
<text>The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division was a mounted infantry division of the British Empire during World War I. The division was raised in March 1916 and was assigned to the I ANZAC Corps. On establishment, it consisted of four brigades comprising three Australian Light Horse and one New Zealand mounted rifles, supported by British horse artillery. In 1917, one of the Australian brigades was replaced by a British yeomanry brigade. After April 1917, the standard order of battle was reduced to two Australian brigades and one New Zealand brigade, although the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and other British mounted brigades were temporarily attached several times during operations.

The division had two wartime commanders; the first was the Australian Major-General Harry Chauvel, who had commanded the 1st Light Horse Brigade at Gallipoli. When Chauvel was promoted to command the Desert Columnof which the division was parthe was replaced by the New Zealander Major-General Edward Chaytor from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, who remained in command for the rest of the war. Post-war, Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie commanded the division from December 1918 until it was disbanded in June 1919.

In December 1915, the brigades that would form the ANZAC Mounted Division were evacuated from the Gallipoli Campaign and became part of the British Empire&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In March 1916, after raising the division served, as the mounted formation, in the I ANZAC Corps. Then subsequently served under the command of Eastern Force for most of 1916. The division served in the Desert Column from the end of 1916 until mid-1917, when the column was expanded and renamed the Desert Mounted Corps. The division fought and won almost all the major battles across the Sinai Peninsula during 1916, and the following year it fought from Gaza to Jerusalem in southern Palestine. In 1918, it took part in the Jordan Valley operations, the raid on Amman, the raid on Es Salt and the final advance to Amman and Ziza, part of the Battle of Megiddo. During which the division formed the main part of Chaytor&#x27;s Forcewhich captured 10,300 men from the Turkish Fourth Army.

==Etymology==

The division is variously referred to in sources as the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, (abbreviated to the A. &amp; N. Z. Mounted Division), the ANZAC Mounted Division, or the Anzac Mounted Division.

==Formation history==
Prior to formation, units that would form the division&#x27;s brigades served as part of the Force in Egypt from December 1914, and then in the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, from May to December 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign. At Gallipoli, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade served dismounted in the New Zealand and Australian Division. Them returned to Egypt where the ANZAC Mounted Division was formed in March 1916; and assigned to the I ANZAC Corps as its mounted formation. The first mounted or cavalry division to serve with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). The brigades consisted of three regiments, each with an establishment of twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, of six troops. Not all the division&#x27;s troops came from Australia and New Zealand; the artillery units, with 18-pounders, and the Divisional Ammunition Column were provided by the British Royal Horse Artillery from the Territorial Force. The brigade&#x27;s four batteries were each allocated to a fighting brigade. The 1st Light Horse Brigade had the Leicestershire Battery; the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the Ayrshire Battery; the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, the Inverness-shire Battery, and the Somerset Battery was attached to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. To replace the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been assigned to the Imperial Mounted Division in January 1917, the British 22nd Mounted Brigade joined the division from February to July 1917. Serving alongside them were several smaller support units, which included an engineer field squadron, a signal squadron, and a divisional train.
The first General Officer Commanding (GOC) Major-General Harry Chauvel, appointed 16 March, was promoted from brigade commander, although he had temporarily commanded the 1st Australian Division for a short period at Gallipoli. His Chief-of Staff was Lieutenant-Colonel John Gilbert Browne of 14th (King&#x27;s) Hussars, a professional from the British Army who had fought in the Second Boer War and with the British Cavalry Division, on the Western Front in the early stages of the war. The rest of the division&#x27;s staff were selected on merit for their service at Gallipoli. The same process was applied to select the brigade staff, and regimental and squadron officersmost of whom had seen prior service at Gallipoli or in the Second Boer War.

==Service history==
===Sinai===
On 15 March, the ANZAC Mounted Division relieved the 1st Australian Division, on the front line. Members of the division carried out their first offensive action, crossing the Suez Canal, in the Jifjafa raid between 11 and 14 April 1916, resulting in the campaign&#x27;s first Australian death. Later the same month, the 2nd and the New Zealand Brigades were moved into the Sinai Desert in response to the defeat at Katia of the 5th Mounted Brigade. By the end of the month, the division had been established around Romani in the Sinai. Here the brigade machine-gun squadrons were formed; each had eight officers and 222 other ranks, with twelve Maxim guns carried on pack horses. These replaced the two guns that had previously been part of each regiment&#x27;s establishment. In their place, the regiments were issued with three Lewis guns; these were replaced the following year by twelve Hotchkiss machine-guns.

On 19 July, reconnaissance aircraft located between 8–9,000 Turkish soldiers approaching the division&#x27;s prepared positions. By 3 August, this number had increased to around 18,000 infantry with artillery support. The Battle of Romani was the division&#x27;s first major victory. The advance to contact without infantry support, which began the next day, was defeated at Bir el Abd by a stronger Turkish force.

In September, the division was involved in a &quot;reconnaissance in force&quot; to Mazar, east of Romani. They were discovered en route by German aircraft and the although the operation failed, it persuaded Turkish commanders to evacuate the position two days later. On 11 November, the division was ordered to move east towards Masaid and El Arish on the coast. The division entered the latter on 21 December to find the Turkish garrison had withdrawn. The next day, Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, commanding the Desert Column, arrived and ordered the divisionsupported by the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (ICCB) to attack Magdhaba. Travelling overnight, most of the division was in position by dawn 23 December. Using the additional strength of the camel brigade, and at times fighting hand to hand, Chauvel&#x27;s attack on Magdhaba was the division&#x27;s second victory. Turkish casualties were ninety-seven dead, three hundred wounded and 1,282 prisoners, while the division&#x27;s were twenty-three dead and 124 wounded.

On 8 January 1917, the division, still with the ICCB under command, continued the advance towards the pre-war Egypt-Palestine border at Rafa. They moved from El Arish to Rafa overnight and by 07:00 they were ready for the assault to begin. The Battle of Rafa, although harder fought, became the division&#x27;s third victory. Total casualties were seventy-one dead and 415 wounded for the division and the 5th Mounted Brigade who were also involved. Against this, Turkish casualties were two hundred dead, 168 wounded and 1,434 prisoners.

===Gaza===

In February 1917, just before the division moved forward to take part in the first battle for Gaza, the British 22nd Mounted Brigadea yeomanry brigade from the Territorial Forcejoined the division. The first reconnaissance of the Turkish position at Gaza was carried out by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on 25 March. The rest of the Desert Column moved forward that night. British intelligence had estimated that Gaza garrison comprised around four thousand troops, with their nearest reinforcements away. In fact they had around 15,000 troops based within of Gaza. The division&#x27;s objective was to circle the town to the east and provide a screen against a counter-attack from the north. At 02:30 on 26 March, the division moved out; by 06:00, ground fogwhich had covered the infantry and mounted advancelifted and they were discovered by a Turkish patrol. The division&#x27;s nearest troops charged the Turks and came upon an airfield where two German aircraft took off, turned and attacked the mounted troops. The division responded; one squadron per regiment dismounted and returned fire. By sunrise, the division was behind the Turkish lines and engaged in several skirmishes. During the light horse advance to the coast north of Gaza, the Turkish GOC responsible for the Gaza defences was taken prisoner. The 53rd (Welsh) Division had been responsible for the attack on the town; by 13:00, they had not made much progress and were held down by strong defences. The ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered at 15:15 to prepare for a dismounted assault. Chauvel completed his concentration within an hour. Then, fighting hand to hand and using their bayonets, the division reached the outskirts of the town. The New Zealand and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades entered the town from the north and west. At 18:00, Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, GOC Eastern Force, and Chetwode agreed to call off the attack towards nightfall, due to their belief that there was a lack of progress, and the approaching threat from Turkish reinforcements. According to Gullett, the error in that decision can perhaps be demonstrated by the lack of any Turkish intervention to the division&#x27;s regrouping and withdrawal back to their own lines. At 21:30, the Turkish reinforcements were still several miles away; one group confronted by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade immediately stopped advancing. In Chetwode&#x27;s post-action report, he says that the time taken for the division to regroup was caused by them retrieving their wounded from inside Gaza. British wireless operators intercepted a Turkish Army message from Gaza, timed at 19:45, reporting that their position had been lost.

The failure at Gaza resulted in the Turkish Army building a long defence line between Gaza and Beersheba, defended by 20–25,000 troops. Dobell&#x27;s plan for the second battle required his infantry to assault Gaza itself while the mounted forces would operate on their right flank, to force the Turkish troops towards Beersheba, hinder the movement of reinforcements from there to Gaza, and prepare to pursue any retreating Turkish forces.

Preliminary manoeuvring began on 16 April and the main attack would start the next day. At 02:00, the division was in position at Shellal. Reconnaissance patrols convinced Chauvel they would be unable to break through the Ottoman line without infantry support. The main infantry battle began at 07:15 on 19 April following a two-hour bombardment, with the division deployed to attack Sausage Ridge on the extreme right of the three British infantry division&#x27;s assault at Gaza. The division suffered severe casualties while it was comparatively inactive during the infantry attacks. However, during the previous night of 18/19 April, Chauvelunder orders not to make a dismounted attackmoved towards the Hareira Redoubt to protect the army&#x27;s right. In the morning of 19 April, the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades advanced without opposition. However, by mid-afternoon they were confronted by around one thousand Turkish cavalrymen, whom they fought off with rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire. By 20 April, the attack had halted in a decisive victory for the Turkish forces. The attack cost the British 5,900 casualties, but only 105 of those were from the division the fewest of any involved.

This second failure resulted in the recall of Murray and the appointment of General Edmund Allenby to command the EEF. When Chauvel had been promoted to command the Desert Column, he was replaced as GOC by Chaytor who had commanded the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. Other changes resulted in the division losing the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to the new Imperial Mounted Division, and the Yeomanry Mounted Division was also raised. This enabled the three divisions to rotate monthly from the front line to resting, to carry out training during a period of inaction. During May, the 1st Light Horse Brigade and divisional engineers were involved in a raid on the Turkish railway line running south of Beersheba towards the frontier with Egypt, while the other two brigades moved forward in support.

===Beersheba===
On 24 October, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved forward to Asluj to screen the advance of the ANZAC and the Australian Mounted Divisions. On 31 October, Beersheba was captured after the town was attacked by two infantry and two mounted divisions. The 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades made a combined attack on Tel el Saba, after the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had cut the road north from Beersheba to Hebron. At 15:00 the same day, the New Zealanders attacked and captured with 132 prisoners and four machine-guns with a bayonet charge, while the retreating Turkish soldiers were pursued by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Chaytor&#x27;s troops were now in possession of Tel el Saba. At 15:30, orders were issued for the final assault on Beersheba; the 1st Light Horse Brigade was tasked with capturing a line from a prominent mound outside to the Beersheba mosque. Beersheba was finally taken following a mounted infantry charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade.

===Capturing the remainder of Gaza line===

On 1 November, the division was ordered to push the 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades further north of Beersheba towards Tel el Khuweilfe with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved towards Dhaheriye on their right. The troops moving north skirmished with Ottoman cavalry then occupied a position between the Makhrune well and Towal Abu Jerwal, capturing four machine-guns and 180 prisoners. Overnight, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was ordered towards Tel el Khuweilfe, moving between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on their right and the 7th Mounted Brigade to the left. When they reached the British line they relieved the yeomanry and at 11:00 they fought off a counter-attack by two Turkish infantry companies. They remained in the line until 16:00 when the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 5th Mounted Brigade relieved them. During these first two days of fighting, water was in short supply and each brigade was relieved in turn to march back to water. This continued until 5 November when the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Brigade&#x27;s were ordered back to Beersheba. By 7 November, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were located to the west of Sheria, while the New Zealand Brigade remained temporarily attached to the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which was still fighting at Khuweilfe. Later that day, during the breakthrough of the old Gaza to Beersheba line, the ANZAC Mounted Division advanced to Ameida where the 1st Light Horse Brigade captured an ammunition supply train, a field hospital, a large quantity of stores and 391 prisoners. At 12:30, news of the fall of Gaza reached Chaytor and he was ordered towards Jemmameh, to cut off the retreating Turkish forces, capturing the village of Dilakh in the process. Here the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to attack; the 5th Light Horse Regiment galloped the through exploding shells to capture part of the village, which they held through the night. The guns shelling them were located nearby; at dawn the following day they secured the rest of the village and captured the guns. Chaytor&#x27;s plans to advance depended on the Australian Mounted Division moving up to join them, but by 16:30 on 7 November, they were still engaged in fighting at Hareira and Sheria and their horses had not been watered for some time. Early on 8 November, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade occupied a line from the Nejile mound to the Wadi Hesi and an hour later the 7th Mounted Brigadestill attached to the divisionarrived as reinforcements. As the division advanced, they saw retreating Ottoman soldiers and at 15:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade captured Jemmameh and its water supply. Positioned beyond the village, the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments were attacked by between five and seven thousand men, supported by artillery. The attack lasted the remainder of the day but petered out overnight. By the evening of 8 November, all the Turkish positions on the Gaza-Beersheba line had been captured and the Turkish Army was withdrawing northwards.

===Judean plain===

After watering their horses overnight on 8/9 November, the division was the only mounted force ready to move by morning. At 06:00, Chaytor ordered the advance onto the Judean plain; the 1st Light Horse Brigade on the left rode towards Simsim and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the right towards Bureir, with the 7th Mounted Brigade as reserve. Several large groups of Turkish soldiers were captured without resistance; however during the day, opposition increased as the two withdrawing Turkish armies became more organised. In the face of machine-gun and artillery fire the village of Bureir, along with two howitzers and stores, were captured. Continuing their advance, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade bypassed Huleikat and headed towards Kaukabah, capturing 110 wagons and 390 prisoners. Having outdistanced their lines of communication, the brigade waited in the village under shellfire for three hours for their supply trains to reach them. Then, sighting a convoy at Kustine, the brigade galloped through machine-gun and artillery fire to capture another one hundred wagons and three hundred prisoners. Turkish artillery opened fire on them but the brigade was ordered to hold its ground. Just after dark. part of the 7th Light Horse Regiment was attacked by Turkish infantry; but a Turkish speaking light horse officer convinced them they were surrounded and 230 men surrendered. Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, GOC 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was conscious of his troops exposed position and ordered a withdrawal to Es Suafir el Gharbiye, during which they skirmished with Turkish infantry and captured another four howitzers at Ebdis. On 10 November, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was relieved by the 75th Division and moved to Hamame on the coast for three days rest.

On the other flank, at 09:00, the 1st Light Horse Brigade entered Bureir unopposed and continued on, arriving at Mejdel at 14:00 and capturing 164 prisoners. Beit Duras was held in strength so brigade headed for the coast, stopping for the night south of Esdud. On 10 November, they moved on Isdudthe ancient Ashdodopposed by Turkish cavalry to the north and east of the town. By 10:00, they had secured the Jisr Isdud stone bridge over the Wadi Sukereir in front of the village. However, they were confronted by a strong Turkish defence line stretching from Beit Duras to El Butani el Gharbiye and to the mouth of the Wadi Sukereir. Not having the numbers to break the line, the brigade dug in to wait for the infantry to catch up. On 11 November, the brigade left Esdud to secure the area along the Wadi Sukereir between the bridge and the sea. They subsequently located an ample supply of fresh water and a beach suitable for landing supplies from the sea. The 2nd Light Horse Regiment advanced towards the bridge, while the 1st Light Horse Regiment moved to the left and at Burka they established a line of defence along the Wadi el Khubb facing north-east. Under fire, the 2nd Light Horse Regiment crossed the bridge and gradually forced the Turkish rearguard back. By nightfall, they had occupied the Tel el Murre mound and established a substantial bridgehead over the Sukereir at the Esdud bridge towards Burkha.

On 12 November, the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade attacked Burkhawith the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments in support to their leftusing their machine-guns to enfilade the Turkish rearguard trenches. The next day, the 1st and the New Zealand Brigades followed behind the Yeomanry Mounted Division, supporting their advance on Yebna to reach the mouth of the Wadi Rubin. On 14 November, the division resumed their advance. The New Zealanders on the left headed towards Jaffa, reaching the Wadi Hanein before meeting any opposition. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, on the right, headed towards Ramleh; they reached Deiran unopposed but saw Turkish troops heading towards the New Zealand Brigade. At 12:00, the New Zealanders were engaged with German machine-gun and rifle fire from a strongly defended line at Ayun Kara. During the following Battle of Ayun Kara, the Wellington Mounted Rifles put in a bayonet charge, capturing two machine-guns and killing twenty defenders. The Auckland Mounted Rifles to their left could not break through the German rearguard, which was being rapidly reinforced. While they were being shelled at 14:30, the regiment was attacked by 1,500 troops. The Auckland Mounted Rifles commanding officer requested urgent reinforcements and a squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles was sent to assist. By 16:00, the Turkish rearguard had advanced close enough for a bayonet and grenade charge, which the Auckland Mounted Rifles managed to hold, forcing the attackers to withdraw leaving 162 dead and a large number of wounded behind. New Zealand casualties were twenty-one dead and eighty-eight wounded.

On 15 November, the division&#x27;s reconnaissance patrols reported the way ahead was clear. They resumed their advance led by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, which reached Ramleh at 11:00 unopposed. The 1st Light Horse Regiment moved ahead to reach Lydda further north, where reports of Turkish soldiers nearby were received. Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Granville in command ordered two troops to investigate, and forty troopers rode out to locate them and charged a hostile column while under artillery and machine-gun fire. They captured four machine-guns, 297 Turkish and two German soldiers, and sustained one dead and six wounded. On their left, the New Zealand Brigade reached Rishon LeZion and continued towards Jaffa but was ordered to halt a few miles short of the port by EEF GHQ. The following morning, the Wellington Mounted Rifles was ordered to send reconnaissance patrols towards Jaffa. Meeting no resistance, the patrols rode into the city, which had been evacuated; Chaytor told Allenby that the city had been taken. Other reconnaissance patrols were sent to the River Auju, which was found to be wide and up to deep. Three crossing points were found; a shallow ford near the river mouth, a second crossing near a dam over a bridge at Khurbet Hadra, and a third crossing was located at a watermill beside Jerisheh. On the opposite bank Turkish infantry could be clearly seen digging defences.

===River Auja===

While the main effort of the EEF headed north-west towards Jerusalem, by 20 November the division had established a line of observation posts along the River Auja a few miles north of Jaffa, stretching from Nalin at its eastern end, through Budrus and El Yehudiyeh, then along higher ground south of the Sheik Abu ex Zeitun mound and to the coast. When the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the ICCB arrived, the 1st Brigade was sent to the rear to rest at Yebna. The next day, the New Zealanders were relieved by the 161st (Essex) Brigade, but remained near the front ready for an assault on the river crossings. During this time, mounted patrols advanced to the three crossings and the nearby villages but met with strong resistance. On 24 November, following a bombardment of the Turkish defensive line, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles forced a crossing at the river mouth ford, defeated a small party of Turkish soldiers and occupied Sheikh Muannis. They were followed across by the Wellington Mounted Rifles, which moved through the Canterbury Mounted Rifles to capture the Khurbet Hadrah bridge. Once the bridge was secured, they were relieved by an infantry battalion, which took over the defences while a squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles guarded the ford and the Auckland Mounted Rifles advanced in front of the infantry holding the bridge. At dawn on 25 November, a Turkish force of around one thousand men attacked the Auckland Mounted Rifles, which was forced to withdraw back to the infantry positions. At the same time, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles counter-attacked the Turkish right but the determined Turkish attackers forced the New Zealand Brigade and infantry back across the Auja. On 27 November, further Turkish advances forced the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB and the 2nd Brigade back from their position on the right. Over the next few days, trench raids were carried out by both sides, lasting until 7 December when the division handed over their sector of the front to the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The 1st and 2nd Brigades were withdrawn to the rear but the New Zealand Brigade remained at the front in reserve.

===Jericho===

In February 1918, the divisionless the 2nd Light Horse Brigadewas attached to the XX Corps for the advance into the Jordan Valley. During the advance across the Judean Hills and down into the valley to the Dead Sea, the division was tasked with holding the right flank south from Bethlehem and outflank any Turkish defenders confronting the advance.

The British advance started on 14 February; five days later the division was established at El Muntar, west of the Dead Sea. Early on 20 February, the New Zealand Brigade conducted dismounted assaults on the hills Jebel el Kahmum and Tubk el Kaneiterah east of Bethlehem. Both hills were heavily defended and covered by artillery and machine-guns. They found the going heavy and the Turkish defenders did not pull back until the hills were outflanked by the 60th (London) Division advancing to the north. Just after 14:00, the two divisions were closing in on the Jordan Valley when a troop from the 1st Light Horse Regiment reached the valley floor. They were soon followed by the remainder of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, with orders to advance north to the Wadi Jofet Zeben. Plans were formed for a joint attack on Nebi Musa, but the Turkish defenders withdrew that night. Instead the 1st Light Horse Brigade headed for Jericho, and at 08:00 the 3rd Light Horse Regiments entered the town virtually unopposed. The brigade pushed on towards the River Jordan and the bridge at Ghoraniye, and by nightfall the two brigades&#x27; and the division&#x27;s artillery were positioned around the bridge. They were relieved the next day by the infantry and arrived back at Bethlehem in the early hours of 23 February. The division left the Auckland Mounted Rifles, with a subsection of machine guns and an artillery batteryunder command of the 60th Divisionin the Jordan Valley holding a strong position where the road from Jerusalem falls into the valley.

===Amman Raid / Bridging the River Jordan===

The division&#x27;s next operation was a raid on Amman, east-north-east of Jericho, by the division, with the ICCB attached, supported by the 60th Division. Heavy rain delayed the operation for several days but by 20 March, the weather improved and the level of the flooded River Jordan dropped. The Turks and the swift river thwarted British bridging units from crossing on the direct route to Amman at Ghoraniye. But further downstream at Hajla, on the night of 21–22 March, D Field Troop, Australian engineers, commanded by Captain E.J. Howells, with help from the 3rd Light Horse, rafted over infantry from the 23rd Battalion of Londoners, and then forced the first bridge across the Jordan, At 04:00 the morning of the 23rd, the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment crossed the bridge, turned north and attacked the rear of the Turkish troops that were preventing the crossing at Ghoraniye. By midday, the Aucklanders had secured the east bank and captured four machine-guns and sixty-eight prisoners, allowing the British to bridge the river there.

The rest of the division crossed the river during the night. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, providing flank protection for 60th Division, went north to locate the track to Es Salt, which is north-east of Jericho but at an altitude higher. Leading the remainder of the force, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced to Amman in the east. At 11:00, several hundred Turkish cavalry were sighted east of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The GOC Ryrie and the 6th Light Horse Regiment attempted to cut them off but they escaped in the rugged terrain. At 15:00, the brigade regrouped and set out for the Hekr spring on the plain. Finding the tracks unsuitable for wheeled transport, the division&#x27;s artillery and supply train had to remain behind. This caused a delay while essential stores were transferred to camels. The advance resumed at 21:30; at times the troopers had to dismount and lead their horses along the tracks, through heavy rain which began to fall at 02:00 on 25 March. The first troops reached Ain el Hekr at 04:00 and waited for the rest of the division to arrive, and at 19:30 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved out again across the plateau. Even on the flat progress was slow, the camels slipping in the rain and the wet conditions, slowed the horsemen. Soon after observing a Turkish convoy in the distance, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was ordered to attack. The convoy of nineteen lorries, three cars, one armoured car and several other vehicles was captured along with twelve prisoners. Another patrol from the 6th Light Horse Regiment captured sixty-one prisoners at Suweile. Just before dawn, the 7th Light Horse Regiment leading met up with the New Zealand Brigade, which had travelled independently via the Shunet Nimrin road. The New Zealanders route had been easier than that used by the main force. Chaytor, aware that his men had not rested for three days and nights, postponed the assault for twenty-four hours.

During this rest period, on the night of 26 March Chaytor ordered the railway lines north and south of Amman to be cut to prevent any escape or reinforcement by rail. The New Zealanders destroyed a section of rail long to the south, while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was confronted by Turkish cavalry and could not reach the northern rail line. Early on 27 March the division advanced to Amman, supported by a four-gun lightweight mountain artillery battery from the ICCB. At Amman, the Turkish Army had four thousand infantry in well-constructed defences dug in along the heights, looking down on the division. Supported by fifteen artillery pieces and machine-guns, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade to the right were to cross the Wadi Amman and assault the hills between Amman and the railway station. The 1st and 2nd Battalions, ICCB would assault Amman from the front while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to their left would circle around north and approach Amman from the rear. The New Zealand Brigade met with heavy machine-gun fire and were not in position to attack until 15:00. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade dismounted just under from Amman and approached on foot. Advancing through shell and machine-gun fire, the brigade reached within of the village before they were forced to withdraw. It was the same with the camel battalions; in the face of heavy machine-gun fire they were also stopped. On the right, the New Zealanders attack also failed, and during the afternoon they observed a train arriving from the south, which a prisoner confirmed contained three hundred reinforcements. During that night, the New Zealand Brigade stopped a Turkish bayonet charges.

While this was going on, at 15:00 the Wellington Mounted Rifles and the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB were destroying of railway line and several culverts to the south-east. That night, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was sent north of Amman to destroy a railway bridge. Amman was now cut off from reinforcements by rail but the previous day&#x27;s fighting convinced Chaytor that his force was not strong enough to take Amman alone. To their north the 1st Light Horse Brigade and 60th Division had captured Es Salt and were defending it against counter-attacks. The GOC 60th Division, Major-General John Shea, ordered the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade and two batteries of mountain guns to Amman. After they arrived early on 28 March, Chaytor decided to attack again. The assault began at 13:00 and was again defeated by heavy gunfire. On 29 March, having repaired the railway track, a train of Turkish reinforcement arrived at Amman from the north. Chaytor decided to order a night attack and at 02:00 on 30 March, the division attacked and had some success, but eight hours later, by 10:00 it was clear the attack would not succeed. But it was not until four hours later, soon after 14:00, it was decided to call off the battle and return to the Jordan valley.

The division&#x27;s casualties, including the ICCB, were heavy128 dead, 551 wounded and fifty-five missing, which was 248 more than those of the much larger 60th Division. The division captured 615 prisoners, ten machine-guns, two field kitchens, twenty-six lorries, five cars, several horse-drawn wagons and the New Zealanders captured an aeroplane. During the battle, the division fired over 587,000 rounds of small arms ammunition (SAA).

===Ghoraniye bridge-head===
On 2 April, Chaytor was given command of the Jordan Valley defences, consisting of the division, the ICCB, two batteries of 4.5-inch howitzers and two heavier 60-pounders. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, with the 5th Light Horse Regiment attached, was established on the east bank of the Jordan River. The ICCB, with the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments attached, was holding a line at Abu Tellul and stretching along the Wadi Mellahah. Daily the defenders saw Turkish patrols but were not attacked, and the division spent their days digging trenches, stringing barbed wire and siting machine-guns. The New Zealand Brigade was further west in the valley between Jericho and the Jordan river.

Then on 11 April the defences on the Wadi Nimrin and in the hills at Musallabeh were attacked by a large Turkish force. A patrol from the 2nd Light Horse Regiment discovered a Turkish unit of around 100 men, on the left bank of the Wadi Nimrin at 04:30. By dawn there were one thousand infantrymen approaching, in waves about long, on both sides of the wadi. They got to within of the barbed wire defences before the division&#x27;s guns opened fire. By now the Turkish force was estimated at two thousand men. At 13:00 Brigadier-General Charles Frederick Cox GOC 1st Light Horse Brigade ordered the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Regiments to ride out and encircle them. But their strength, in men and machine-guns, was such that the mounted troopers could not approach them. Sporadic firing continued all night but by 04:00 12 April the Turkish force had withdrawn. Turkish casualties were fifty-one dead, 550 wounded and ninety unwounded prisoners. The brigade had seven dead and seventeen wounded.

At Musallabeh to the north at 04:30 the crossing was subjected to a heavy artillery barrage, with infantry following close behind. At 05:00 the barrage lifted and the Turkish infantry attack the outnumbered ICCB, and attached light horse regiments. For the next three hours at close quarters a fire fight ensued. At 08:00 the attack petered out, but the defenders were still subjected to sniper and artillery fire. Another attack in the afternoon also failed, and they withdrew leaving 170 dead. The ICCB and light horse casualties were eighteen dead and twenty-seven wounded.

===Es Salt raid===

On 18 April, the division crossed the Jordan valley to attack the Turkish troops at Shunet Nimrin in the nearby foot-hills. Their orders were &quot;to inflict losses on the enemy and to convey the impression that we are about to advance again to Amman&quot;. The brigades, supported by artillery and armoured cars, were confronted by strong Turkish defences and that night withdrew back across the river. The incursion was ordered by Allenby; the result was the Turkish sending reinforcements to the area and strengthening their defences.

Two days later, Chaytor received orders for another attack across the Jordan on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt. This time, commanded by Chauvel, the division would be again joined by the 60th Division, and by the Australian Mounted Division, the ICCB, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and the 20th Indian Brigade. The division, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was to support the 60th Division in a minor role. The force crossed the Jordan overnight on 29/30 April. The division supported the 60th Division&#x27;s, assaults on Shunet Nimrin, but they could not break the Turkish position. Shea the GOC 60th Division used the ANZAC brigades on his flanks, but they were prevented from getting forward by the strong defences in the rugged terrain. All except a squadron from the 6th Light Horse Regiment attached to the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade.

Elsewhere, the force was involved in heavy fighting against strong Turkish defences; during a counter-attack it lost more than two batteries of artillery, which was captured by the advancing Turkish soldiers. On 1 May, 60th Division was supposed to attack Shunet Nimrin again but failures elsewhere caused the assault to be cancelled. Instead, the Australian Mounted Division which had advanced to occupy Es Salt, sent the 5th Mounted Brigade to attack Shunet Nimrin from the rear. To assist them, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to cut off any retreat from there northwards. The Australian attack faltered, partly in response to Turkish successes in the west, and by 20:00 they were still stationary. Another frontal assault by 60th (London) Division at 02:00 on 2 May also failed; by now the British position was turning more to defence than attack. In the three days since crossing the Jordan valley, the force had been involved in almost continuous fighting. On 3 May, yet another frontal attack by 60th Division failed and the ANZAC Division covering the flanks were confronted by growing numbers of Turkish troops. At 16:00 on 3 May, with an acceptance of the need to save his command, Chauvel ordered a withdrawal back from Es Salt to the Jordan valley. The last unit to cross back across the Jordan was the New Zealand Brigade, leaving the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles as the east bank guard force, along with the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead.

The operation failed in its objectives, only resulting in the capture of one thousand prisoners. Casualties for the two mounted divisions were comparability light at fifty dead and 310 wounded, while the 60th Division suffered 1,116 casualties.

===Summer in the Jordan Valley===
In normal times, no one lived in the Jordan Valley during the warmer months of the year; the residents of Jericho left the village for the cooler hills. The residents said it was impossible for Europeans to live there after April. To prevent the Turkish Army from re-occupying the valley, Allenby had to keep a defence force in place. To that end, the division patrolled the southern sector, which included Ghoraniye and the Dead Sea. The division was reinforced by the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade. The infantry held the Ghoraniye bridgehead on the eastern side of the Jordan river. Because of the severe climate, there was little daylight activity during the summer. Patrols would normally be sent out at night, often returning in the morning after encountering Turkish cavalry trying to reach the Jordan to water their horses. The divisions were sent, in turn, to rest at Bethlehem and were given leave in Jerusalem. During this time, the division conducted training camps for non-commissioned officers, Hotchkiss machine-gunners and signallers, and all ranks took part in general military training. However, the troops left in the valley were being beginning to suffer from &quot;malaria and other diseases&quot;.

In June, the 1st Light Horse Brigade returned from Bethlehem and replaced the 4th Light Horse Brigade in the Musallabeh sector. The brigade deployed with two regiments forward and one in reserve at the Wadi el Auja front line. By early July, they had 3rd Light Horse Regiment on the left, 2nd Light Horse Regiment on the right and the 1st Light Horse Regiment in reserve. Because of illness and a lack of replacements, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment had only 210 men available and the other regiments were in a similar condition. Since they arrived, the brigade had been subjected to Turkish shelling. Activity then increased to such an extent that a Turkish attack was expected at any time. In preparation, extra water and ammunitionenough for two dayswas cached in the defence posts. On 13 April, Turkish artillery fire on the brigades&#x27; positions increased and that night, movement could be head at the barbed wire defence line. At 01:00 on 14 April, the forward troops reported that the enemy appeared to be massing, and later a &quot;strong body of troops&quot; about to their front. Lieutenant-Colonel George John Bell, commanding 3rd Light Horse Regiment asked for a protective artillery barrage in front of his position. The Turkish responded with shelling of their own, which lifted at 02:30. In the quiet, the regiment heard some commands shouted in German. Then the Turkish artillery laid down another one-hour barrage. When that lifted, around one thousand troops attacked the brigade&#x27;s forward defences in what became known as the battle of Abu Tellul. In the 2nd Light Horse Regiment&#x27;s sector, some forward posts were withdrawn to safer areas. Regimental headquarters was overrun and other positions surrounded. Other troops were overrun but regained their posts by counter-attacking. Further west, a position held by the regimental adjutant, a signals officer, grooms, batmen and signallers, was all that remained between the attacking Germans and the division&#x27;s artillery batteries. Troops were then withdrawn to a trench line below a crest so the attacking Germans coming over the skyline were easily targeted and the brigade held off the attack for the next hour.

Chaytor, informed of the attack, sent a squadron from the 4th Light Horse Brigadewhich was still close byto reinforce the position. Cox, commanding 1st Light Horse Brigade, ordered the 1st Light Horse Regimenthis only reserveto counter-attack the Germans. At 03:30, one squadron and four machine-guns were sent to reinforce the position at Abu Tellul. At dawn on 14 April, it became clear that the main German assault was centred on Abu Tellul, so two more squadrons were sent to assist them. The reinforcements assembled below the crest, fixed bayonets and counter-attacked the Germans, whom taken by surprise, broke and withdrew to their own trenches. The position at Abu Tellul was now secure but on the other flank in the west, the German attack was progressing. At 08:00, the last reserve squadron counter-attacked there, forcing the Germans back and capturing one hundred prisoners. By 09:00, the brigade was back in control of its previous positions and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade moved to sweep clear to their front. The battle cost the Germans 105 dead, and 358 prisoners; another sixty-seven Turkish prisoners were captured. One group of one hundred captured German Stormtroopers were armed with forty-two automatic riflesthe German equivalent of the Hotchkissalmost one between every two men. The brigade casualties were twenty-three dead and forty-six wounded. Ammunition expended by the brigade was 19,000 rifle rounds, 20,000 Hotchkiss and 30,000 machine gun rounds.

===Chaytor&#x27;s Force===

In September 1918, British intelligence reported that the Turkish Fourth Army, comprising six thousand infantrymen and two thousand cavalry with 74 artillery pieces, was still east of the Jordan. Further south at Ma&#x27;an was the Fourth Army&#x27;s four to six thousand-man II Corps. However Allenby planned that the next offensive would take place on the coastal Sharon plain and in the Judean Hills near Nablus. To accomplish that, the EEF had to realign to the left flank and convince the opposition that the main attack would take place in the Jordan Valley. To allow this to happen, the division remained in the valley as the main component of Chaytor&#x27;s Forcethe division reinforced by the 20th Indian Brigade, Jewish Legion (38th and 39th Battalions, Royal Fusiliers), and 1st and 2nd Battalions, British West Indies Regiment and support troops. Chaytor&#x27;s Force was responsible for holding the eastern flank in the Jordan Valley. While the EEF moved west, the force built new and larger camps and 15,000 dummy horses. At the same time, the infantry battalions marched around the valley, giving the illusion of a much larger force, and constructed false bridges across the Jordan. Part of Chaytor&#x27;s orders were to conduct patrols east of the Jordan; if there was evidence of a Turkish withdrawal, they were to head north and capture the crossing at Damieh and east to seize Amman and block the Fourth Army&#x27;s retreat north to Damascus. While the Australian Mounted Division, which was advancing along the coast as part of the main drive towards Damascus, had received swords and cavalry training in August 1918, the ANZAC Mounted Division did not, and continued in the mounted rifles role until the end of the war.

The force was divided to cover the Jordan Valley. The 2nd Light Horse and 20th Indian Brigades held a line between the Dead Sea along the Jordan to the Auja bridgehead. The New Zealand Brigade and the other four infantry battalions held the line from Auja to Mellahah and Ahu Tellul, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade was in reserve at Jericho. Over the nights of 17–19 September, the divisions&#x27; patrols crossed east of the river and were involved in several fire fights with the defenders. During daylight on 19 September, the two West Indian battalions carried out bayonet charges and captured Turkish positions west of the river. An attempt by the Royal Fusiliers failed to gain any ground. Throughout the next day, the Turkish defenders fought hard against any attack. On 21 September, the Auckland Mounted Rifles advanced to the north on the western side of the river towards the Damieh bridge and Mafid Jozele, forcing the Turkish troops to withdraw to their reserve line. On 22 September at 03:30, on the left the New Zealand Brigade and mounted West Indies infantry battalions reached the Nablus–Damieh road and reached the Mazar mound an hour later. They next captured El Makhruk along with a large supply dump, seventy vehicles and 724 prisonersone of which was the GOC of the Turkish 53rd Division. Before daylight, they captured the Damieh bridge with a dismounted attack during which one of the West Indies companies charged with them. The Fourth Army units, leaving small rear guards behind, now started to withdraw from the east bank towards Amman, pursued by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, a West Indian battalion and the Royal Fusiliers battalions. They became involved in several small fights as they tried to turn the Turkish to their front, back towards the river. That night, Chaytor issued orders for a general advance the next day. In the south, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s objectives were Kabr Mujahid and the Rame mound. The 20th Brigade, the Royal Fusiliers battalions and a light horse squadron would take Shunet Ninirin. The 1st Light Horse Brigade would capture a crossing on the Jordan at Mafid Jozele, forcing the Seventh Army back into the hills. The New Zealand Brigade were to gallop to Es Salt followed by the West Indies battalions on foot. The division&#x27;s artillery, supply train and all wheeled vehicles would travel along the road from Shunet Nimrin to Es Salt.

Chaytor&#x27;s Force advanced on 23 September; by 04:30, 2nd Light Horse Brigade had taken their first objective and continued towards Tel er Rame. Before night they had climbed out of the foothills and onto the plateau. The 1st Light Horse Brigade forced their crossing and were en route to Es Salt. The 20th Brigade captured Shunet Nimrin and also headed towards Es Salt. The only opposition was in the north, where the New Zealand Brigade were temporarily stopped by a machine-gun post, but by 19:00 they had captured Es Salt along with 312 prisoners, two machine-guns and three artillery pieces. The 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades&#x27; now advanced on Suweile. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade had problems negotiating hill trackssome of which had been damaged by artillery firebut reached Ain es Sir at midday. By now, except for one battalion of fusiliers, Chaytor&#x27;s Force was on the plateau around Es Salt, advancing on Amman.

To close the trap on the Fourth Army, the Auckland Mounted Rifles sent a squadron overnight on 25 September to destroy the railway line north of Amman. The rest of the division set out at 06:00 to attack Amman for a second time with the 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades leading and the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve. Chaytor, being well aware of the terrain, ordered the division to move slowly and to wait for infantry support before attacking if they encountered a strong position. The New Zealand Brigade encountered around two hundred men and artillery on a ridge position north-west of Amman. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade moving along the Ain es Sir-Amman road were slowed down by several machine-gun posts, which they over-ran and captured 130 prisoners, three artillery pieces, and four machine-guns. At 11:00, a British aircraft dropped a note for Chaytor reporting that the defenders were leaving their trenches. Chaytor ordered a mounted charge by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, but they were stopped by the terrain and machine-gun fire. For the next two hours, the brigades gradually fought their way closer to Amman. The break through came when the 7th Light Horse Regiment reached within of the Turkish trenches; they fixed bayonets and charged, capturing 113 prisoners and seven machine-guns. The New Zealand Brigade from the north-west had advanced close enough, so that when they crossed the Wadi Amman they charged and captured the old citadel and the Amman rail station. Within Amman, the division captured 2,360 prisoners, six artillery pieces and several machine-guns.
About to the south, the Turkish II Corpsaround five to six thousand strong of the Fourth Army, were defending Ma&#x27;an from the Arab forces. To hinder their retreat north, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was sent to cut the railway line to the south of Amman and the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to capture Wadi el Hammam and its water supplies. The rest of the force prepared a defence line between Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt, and Suweile. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment captured one hundred pro-Turkish Arabs, then reached Ez Zerka where they discovered ninety-five sick or wounded Turkish soldiers and an artillery piece. The next day, the 1st Light Horse Brigade outflanked Wadi el Hammam and captured 453 prisoners and three machine-guns, and also closed the eastern road north from Ma&#x27;an. The next day, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved south along the railway line and reached Leban, where a prisoner disclosed that the 6,000-man Ma&#x27;am garrison was about to the south. Early on 28 September, the garrison&#x27;s men were located to the south of Kastal by British aircraft, digging trenches. The 5th Light Horse Regiment was sent to reconnoitre the position, which was surrounded by the Beni Sakhr tribe who were harassing the defenders, galloping around the trenches and firing their guns in the air. Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Charles Cameron commanding 5th Light Horse Regiment approached the Turkish commander about their surrender; He was in agreement but disinclined to relinquish their weapons with the Arab force present. When Chaytor was informed of their predicament, he ordered the remainder of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade south to assist. When Cameron reported to Ryriewho was commanding the 2nd Light Horse Brigadethat the situation was becoming critical, he ordered the brigade to gallop, leaving their slower pack horses behind. The brigade arrived just before nightfall, by which time the Turkish had opened fire on the Arabs. Ryrie conferred with the Arab chiefs, who wanted to make a joint assault on the position. Instead, fearing the Arabs&#x27; intention if the Turkish surrendered, Ryrie camped inside the Turkish position for the night. The next morning at 08:00, the New Zealand Brigade arrived and a Turkish force, thirteen artillery pieces, thirty machine-guns, a train with three steam engines and five thousand men went into captivity. In the nine days since operations started, Chaytor&#x27;s Force had taken 10,300 prisoners and captured fifty-seven artillery pieces, 132 machine-guns, eleven railway engines and 106 lorries. His casualties were twenty-seven dead, 105 wounded and seven men missing.

===Disbandment===
While the division withdrew, the Desert Mounted Corps in the west advanced into Syria, where it captured Damascus on 1 October, while Prince Feisal&#x27;s Sherifial force captured Aleppo on 25 October. At the end of October, the Armistice of Mudros was agreed between the British and Ottoman Empires. During this time, the division was withdrawn back to Jerusalem and then Richon. At the end of hostilities, sickness caught up with the men and there were 900 &quot;stretcher cases&quot; laid up and several men died of disease. The 7th Light Horse and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were selected to be part of the forcecommanded by the 28th Divisionthat occupied the Dardanelles and Constantinople, landing on the Dardanelles peninsula on 5 December. In December 1918, Ryrie GOC 2nd Light Horse Brigade, as a brigadier-general, assumed command of the division. In early 1919, while the division was based around Rafa preparing to return home, a revolt broke out in Egypt. The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments had already sailed for Australia in March, and rest of the division had returned most of their equipment to the stores and were waiting for transport ships to return them home. They were rearmed and deployed to patrolling and counter rioting duties. Within a month the revolt was over and the embarkation of the division resumed. The 3rd Light Horse Regiment left in May, the New Zealand Brigade had left by July and by the end of the summer, the rest of the division had followed. The ANZAC Mounted Division officially ceased to exist on 30 June 1919.

Immediately after the war ended, the division&#x27;s horses were taken to the Imperial Remount Depot at Moascar in Egypt. The riding horses were eventually reissued, when required, to units of the British Empire. The heavier pack and draught horses were now redundant, so these were shipped to France and sold.

==Controversies==
On 10 December 1918 after the war had ended and on the eve of going home, soldiers in the Australian and New Zealand Mounted division participated in what has become known as the Surafend massacre. Approximately 40-137 Arab civilians were killed in retaliation for the murder of 21-year-old Leslie Lowry, a trooper in the 1st New Zealand Machine Gun Squadron. Despite a military Court of Inquiry by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force headquarters concluding that there was insufficient evidence for believing that the murderer was a person in the village of Sarafand al-Amar, soldiers took matters into their own hands. Soldiers of the ANZAC Mounted Division armed themselves and attacked the men in the village. While their actions constituted serious crimes while on active service according to British military law, the division met investigators with a wall of silence that prevented anyone from ever being tried or punished for the murders. These actions cast a dark shadow over the disbandment of the ANZAC Mounted Division and Britain, Australia, and New Zealand paid £2060.11 towards rebuilding the destroyed village.

<text>U.S. Route 80 or U.S. Highway 80 (US 80) is a major east–west United States Numbered Highway in the Southern United States, much of which was once part of the early auto trail known as the Dixie Overland Highway. As the &quot;0&quot; in the route number indicates, it was originally a cross-country route, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. Its original western terminus was at Historic US 101 in San Diego, California. However, the entire segment west of Dallas, Texas, has been decommissioned in favor of various Interstate Highways and state highways. Currently, the highway&#x27;s western terminus is at an interchange with Interstate 30 (I-30) on the Dallas–Mesquite city line. Its eastern terminus is in Tybee Island, Georgia, near the Atlantic Ocean. Between Longview, Texas, and Cuba, Alabama, US 80 runs parallel to or concurrently with Interstate 20. It also currently runs through Dallas, Texas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Montgomery, Alabama; Columbus, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; and Savannah, Georgia.

===Texas===

Modern US 80 begins as a significant component of the urban freeway system of Dallas, Texas. With Spur 557, it serves as the shortest freeway route from the central and northern portions of Dallas to I-20, heading east towards Shreveport, Louisiana.

From its origin at I-30 in eastern Dallas, through its interchange with the I-635 &quot;LBJ&quot; Loop, to its junction with I-20 southwest of Terrell, US 80/Spur 557 is a full Interstate-grade, limited-access freeway. (This freeway was originally built as I-20 but was rerouted south of Dallas in 1971 and 1991.) In western Terrell, US 80 leaves the freeway, which continues southeast as (unsigned) Spur 557 to I-20, while US 80 runs north of I-20 through a number of small towns and cities, including Terrell, Mineola, Longview, and Marshall. It rejoins I-20 for about , before splitting to pass through downtown Waskom before crossing into Louisiana.

===Louisiana===

US 80 is parallel to the newer I-20, which has supplanted it as a long-distance route, for the entirety of its length in Louisiana.

The highway crosses the state line from Texas into Caddo Parish as a two-lane road and crosses over to the south of I-20 without connecting with the freeway. It passes through the town of Greenwood where it meets US 79 coming north from Texas, and these two routes run concurrently eastward from there to Minden. US 79/US 80 crosses over I-20 again, this time at an interchange, and enters the city of Shreveport as Greenwood Road. The highway passes over I-220 without an interchange and continues east to an intersection with Jefferson Paige Road where it expands to four undivided lanes and enters the main part of the urbanized area. US 171 ends at US 79/US 80 at the intersection with Hearne Avenue. At this intersection, the road narrows to two through lanes. US 80 intersects I-20 again just east of here. At Mansfield Road (old US 171), the highway name changes to Texas Avenue and angles northeast through an industrial area. The road skirts the I-20/I-49 interchange and expands to four lanes for its final approach to downtown. At the west edge of downtown, eastbound jogs one block east on Crockett Street and two blocks north on Common Street north to Texas Street; westbound jogs one block south from Texas Street down Common to Texas Avenue. US 79/US 80 passes through downtown Shreveport on Texas Street before crossing the Red River on the 1930s vintage Long–Allen Bridge and entering Bossier City and Bossier Parish.

Through Bossier Parish, US 79/US 80 comprises a major urban and suburban arterial (East Texas Street) carrying a minimum of four lanes. In the eastern reaches of the parish, and continuing into Webster Parish, it is a divided highway. The road intersects the east end of I-220 at an interchange. US 79/US 80 stays to the north of I-20, except for a stretch east of Haughton where it strays to the south for a period, skirting the north edge of the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant. At Dixie Inn, the highway intersects US 371. In Minden, US 79 separates from US 80 and continues its northeasterly trajectory toward Arkansas.

East of Minden, US 80 crosses to the south of I-20 and serves the Bienville Parish towns of Gibsland and Arcadia. Entering Lincoln Parish, the highway serves Simsboro and Grambling before entering Ruston (via West California Avenue) and overlapping US 167 on a north–south couplet of streets (Vienna Street/Trenton Street) through the business district. US 80 resumes its eastward path on the north side of Ruston and exits the city on East Georgia Avenue.

Between Ruston and Monroe the highway serves the small communities of Choudrant and Calhoun. Now on the north side of the interstate, it enters Ouachita Parish and approaches the Monroe area as a two-lane road. US 80 crosses Louisiana Highway 143 (LA 143) and enters West Monroe on Cypress Street, where it continues south into the business district and widens to a four-lane urban arterial. At junction LA 34 (Bridge Street), US 80 makes a left turn, angling northeast, and crosses the Ouachita River, entering the city of Monroe. As Louisville Avenue it passes north of downtown, but the downtown area can be accessed via Business US 165 which intersects US 80 at North 5th/North 6th Street and becomes concurrent from there to the east. Louisville Avenue rapidly becomes a heavily commercialized urban arterial and remains so as it passes through the city, eventually curving southwestward and meeting the intersection with Desiard Street.

As Desiard Street, US 80 immediately meets mainline US 165, on its expressway bypass alignment, at a diamond interchange. Eastward from there, US 80 passes through suburban areas until it meets LA 139, where it is forced to turn off its four-lane alignment at an intersection which favors LA 139 traffic. Now a two-lane road, US 80 continues east through northeast Louisiana, passing through Richland and Madison parishes and serving the communities and towns of Start, Rayville (intersection with US 425), Delhi (intersection with LA 17), Tallulah (intersection with U.S. Route 65), Mound, and Delta.

Just west of Delta, US 80 turns off its original route and runs a short distance south to an interchange with I-20. The original alignment of US 80 into Delta is now designated as LA 3218. The original US 80 Mississippi River Bridge remains active as a rail bridge but the roadway portion is closed to traffic. Today, US 80 runs concurrent with the interstate around Delta to the state line, bypassing the town and crossing the Mississippi River bridge into Vicksburg, Mississippi.

===Mississippi===

In Mississippi, US 80 is referred to as &quot;Highway 80&quot; and exists primarily as a two-lane road except in the Jackson area, where it expands to four lanes.

US 80 out of Louisiana runs concurrently with I-20 across the Mississippi River through Vicksburg, to Clinton. When US 80 reaches the western edge of Clinton, it separates to pass directly through the cities of Clinton, Jackson, Flowood, Pearl, and Brandon. After Brandon, US 80 runs parallel to I-20 for the next through the towns of Pelahatchie, Morton, Forest, Lake, Newton, Hickory, and Chunky. East of Chunky, US 80 once again merges with I-20 until it separates again in Meridian, where it merges with US 11 as a two-lane highway heading through the town of Toomsuba and finally ending at the Alabama state line.
===Alabama===

In Alabama, US 80 enters the state near and parallel with I-20 in Cuba. It is co-signed with US 11 until it splits at Cuba and runs east across the center of the state. It is a major highway through Alabama, going through Demopolis and Selma. It continues to Montgomery, where it continues east through Shorter and Tuskegee and leaves the state in Phenix City.

The routing from Meridian, Mississippi to Cuba, Alabama originally ran along its current route but for some 30 years it traveled along I-20 and I-59. However, the routing reverted to the original road early in the 2000s. It is internally designated by the Alabama Department of Transportation as State Route 8 (SR 8).

===Georgia===

US 80 crosses the Chattahoochee River from Alabama into Columbus, where it proceeds along J. R. Allen Parkway through the northern section of the city. Past Columbus, the road meanders through rural Georgia for roughly en route to Macon, where it crosses I-75 and I-16. US 80 passes through downtown Macon via Eisenhower Parkway and parallels the northern boundary of Ocmulgee National Monument just east of the city.

Beyond Macon, US 80 turns southeastward, passing through the cities of Dublin, Swainsboro and Statesboro and running roughly parallel to I-16. On the outskirts of Savannah, US 80 crosses I-95 and follows Louisville Road into the city&#x27;s downtown area. After briefly merging with I-516, US 80 continues eastward along Victory Drive, just south of Savannah&#x27;s historic district. At the community of Thunderbolt, US 80 crosses the Wilmington River and proceeds across the islands and marshes along the Atlantic Coast east of Savannah. There it crosses the Lazaretto Creek onto Tybee Island. The final stretch of US 80 follows Butler Avenue across Tybee Island. A small monument at the intersection of Butler and Tybrisa Street marks the end of the highway.

==History==

Established in 1914 by the Automobile Club of Savannah, the Dixie Overland Highway auto trail was the first major route connecting San Diego, California and Savannah, Georgia. The Dixie Overland Highway Association debated on a definitive western end point for the highway in southern California. California politicians Stanley Hufflund and Ed Fletcher convinced the association in an August 1918 meeting to choose San Diego over Los Angeles. Fletcher was responsible for a grassroots campaign years earlier that resulted in the construction of the Plank Road across the Algodones Dunes in 1915. The Plank Road was the final link in the main highway to San Diego. The association agreed to make San Diego the Dixie Overland Highway&#x27;s western terminus in 1919 and elected Fletcher as the association&#x27;s president. The highway now followed most of what would become US 80, except between Sweetwater, Texas and El Paso. The section of future US 80 through Odessa, Midland and Abilene was instead part of the Bankhead Highway. Other sections of future US 80 were designated as parts of the Lee Highway and the Old Spanish Trail.

In April 1925, the Secretary of Agriculture established the Joint Board on Interstate Highways under the United States Bureau of Public Roads. The board began planning what would become the United States Numbered Highway System. One of the planned highways was US 80 between Savannah and San Diego. The board&#x27;s highway system proposal was submitted by the Secretary of Agriculture to the newly formed American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), which made changes and revisions to the route before adopting the finalized system. On November 11, 1926, all the proposed highways in the system, including US 80, were officially designated. Ed Fletcher continued his involvement with the route after it became US 80, becoming president of the newly formed US 80 Highway Association. During his time with the association, Fletcher lobbied the federal government to pay for improvements to the highway and actively promoted US 80 to motorists.

US 80 was advertised as the first all-weather coast-to-coast route for auto travelers. Originally, its western terminus was in San Diego at US 101, and its eastern terminus in Savannah at US 17. When first commissioned, the highway was approximately . By 1931, it had been shortened to and the eastern terminus extended to Tybee Island. According to the United States Department of Agriculture Bureau of Public Roads, only were considered &quot;improved&quot; roadway in 1931, being paved with brick, concrete or macadam. The remainder was surfaced of lesser materials such as gravel or dirt. In 1947, the U.S. Highway 80 Association (not to be confused with Fletcher&#x27;s earlier organization) was founded to promote business and tourism along US 80 from Savannah to San Diego. Tourism and travel had sharply declined on the entire route since the 1930s. In 1949, the Association was divided into three divisions: The western division, in Tucson, Arizona; the central, in Colorado City, Texas; and the eastern, in Ruston, Louisiana. The U.S. Highway 80 Association resolved to offer membership to businesses along the route, print promotional booklets and strip maps, and pay for billboard ads to attract tourists to drive US 80 from coast to coast. The Association hoped it would also induce travelers on U.S. Route 66 to consider US 80 instead.

Throughout the 1950s, US 80 grew to become a popular highway that often competed with US 66. At one point, more cars were recorded entering California on US 80 than on US 66. Like US 66, US 80 become a keystone highway in American car culture. This renaissance was short-lived, however, with the creation of the Interstate and Defense Highway System in 1957. Four Interstates were slated to replace US 80 as a major highway: Interstate 8 between San Diego and Yuma, Arizona; Interstate 10 between Tucson and Pecos, Texas; Interstate 20 between Pecos and Meridian, Mississippi; and Interstate 16 between Macon, Georgia and Savannah. Between 1964 and 1991, US 80 was slowly removed in increments between Dallas and San Diego. It was considered obsolete to the western states, which favored the new Interstate highways. As such, US 80 is no longer an active U.S. Highway in California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Texas. Today, I-8, I-10 and I-20 have replaced US 80 between Dallas and San Diego. Notable surviving sections of old US 80 include the entirety of both New Mexico State Road 80 and Arizona State Route 80, and all of County Route S80 in Imperial County, California. Other former sections of US 80, particularly in California and parts of Arizona, carry the title Old Highway 80 or similar variations of that name. Multiple efforts are being made to designate whole sections of US 80 as an historic route. California became the first state to recognize Historic U.S. Route 80 in 2007. As of 2018, California, Arizona and Louisiana recognize former and current sections of US 80 as an historic route.

For a time known as the &quot;Broadway of America&quot;, US 80&#x27;s history is second only to US 66 in American highway folklore, as several significant historical events have occurred on or near US 80. Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed on LA 154, just south of US 80 near Gibsland, Louisiana. Coincidentally, Clyde Barrow was buried with his brother just off former US 80 in Dallas. Lee Harvey Oswald was captured at the Texas Theatre on Jefferson Street in Oak Cliff, which at the time was a business spur of US 80. Much of the former route in Arizona between Yuma and Gila Bend follows the marching routes used by General Stephen Watts Kearny&#x27;s army as well as Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke and the Mormon Battalion to California during the Mexican–American War. Further east on old US 80 (now AZ 80) near the New Mexico and Arizona state line stands a monument marking the place where the Apache warrior Geronimo surrendered to the United States Army in 1886. In Tombstone, the O.K. Corral, site of the infamous gunfight, is on the south side of Fremont Street, an old alignment of US 80. US 80 was the route taken by the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama during the American Civil Rights Movement. Prior to the successful march, the Edmund Pettus Bridge on US 80 in Selma was the site of the infamous Bloody Sunday event, where marchers were beaten and wounded by local law enforcement and armed vigilantes. In downtown Dallas, President John F. Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza just blocks from Commerce Street, which was part of US 80 and Business US 80.

===California===

US 80 originally had its western terminus in San Diego. It was gradually decommissioned between 1964 and 1974 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed.

Most former sections of US 80 in San Diego County are no longer part of the state highway system, with only small segments serving as extensions of CA 79 and CA 94. The southernmost section of the Cabrillo Freeway in San Diego is another exception, now designated as CA 163. The freeway between downtown and Washington Street served as part of US 80 from the late 1940s up until the mid-1950s.

The highway started at a junction with 12th Avenue and Market Street, which at the time was US 101 (also decommissioned in San Diego County). In later years, US 80 was extended down Market Street to Pacific Highway when US 101 was rerouted along the water around downtown. US 80 followed 12th Avenue, Park Boulevard and El Cajon Boulevard northeast out of the San Diego metro area. Most of old US 80 between El Cajon and Jacumba remains intact, often utilizing the original concrete roadway. Old US 80 often stays close to I-8. Sometimes it serves as the north or south frontage road or a parallel county road through communities such as Alpine, Willow, Guatay, Live Oak Springs and Boulevard. Often, the road through San Diego County is called Old Highway 80. In Descanso Junction, the pre-interstate route follows Wildwood Glen Lane from a dead end on the north side of I-8 to CA 79. The majority of the road was closed to traffic in 2005. Old US 80 heads south, touching the Mexican border, then passes through Jacumba before being subsumed into I-8 at Desert View Tower. Through the In-Ko-Pah Gorge, old US 80 is impassable by car and often can only be seen from the side of I-8.

Former US 80 through most of the Imperial Valley is now part County Route S80 and CA 115. From the junction with CA 115 and I-8 to Gordon&#x27;s Well, US 80 acts as the north frontage road to the Interstate. It is known as Evan Hewes Highway from State Route 115 to Gordon&#x27;s Well. From SR 115 to Gordon&#x27;s Well it crosses the east Highline Lateral Eight, passes by the BLM Hot Springs and Holtville Hot Springs, the Brock Reservoir at Warren H. Brock Reservoir, Gordon&#x27;s Well RV Park and Storage and Duner&#x27;s Diner. It has junctions with a road that leads to California State Route 98, Brock Research Center Road and Gordon&#x27;s Well Road. All have connections to I-8. At Grays Well, a dead end section of US 80 exists on the south side of I-8 as Grays Well Road. Today it serves as an access road for recreationists visiting the Algodones Dunes and viewing the 1916 Old Plank Road, the first highway across the dunes to Yuma and an immediate predecessor to US 80. Crumbled remains of the original asphalt US 80, built in 1926, can be seen here too. The I-8 north frontage road through the hamlet of Felicity is also a section of old US 80. It is known as Center of The World drive that runs from Ogilby road to Sidewinder road. In Winterhaven, the old route takes Araz Road past the ruins of Araz Stage Station, an old stop on the Butterfield Overland Stage Line, to I-8 Business. The Business Route into Yuma is the final alignment, while the original used part of County Route S24 and Picacho Road to take the 1914 Ocean to Ocean Bridge into Yuma. The California State Legislature declared the entirety of former US 80 in California as Historic U.S. Route 80 in 2007.

===Arizona===

In Arizona, US 80 was first established in 1926 and took a route through Yuma, Phoenix, Tucson and Douglas. Between 1977 and 1989, US 80 was removed from Arizona in favor of I-10 and I-8. Much of US 80 in Arizona remains intact and completely undisturbed by I-8 and I-10, as both Interstates were constructed on more direct routes through Casa Grande and Willcox respectively, where US 80 was often a very long and indirect route through the state.

US 80 originally entered Arizona on land north of the Colorado River and crossed over into Yuma on the Ocean To Ocean Bridge, following Penitentiary Avenue and 1st Street to 4th Avenue (I-8 Business). After 1956, US 80 came into Arizona on I-8 Business to an intersection with the earlier route. US 80 then proceeded to follow I-8 Business past US 95 through Yuma. It then followed I-8 from Yuma through Telegraph Pass to Ligurta, where it split off onto Old Highway 80. US 80 headed east a few miles north of I-8 through Wellton and Tacna to Mohawk, where it rejoined I-8. The route split off again south of I-8 through Dateland and followed the south frontage road to Aztec, rejoining I-8 again.

In Theba, US 80 split off again as the south frontage road east to I-8 Business through Gila Bend to AZ 85. AZ 85, between Gila Bend and Buckeye, is the only section of former US 80 west of Dallas not bypassed by an Interstate. Though AZ 85 is itself a bypass of the original route through Arlington and Cotton Center. Today the older route is known as Old US 80 Highway. In Buckeye, US 80 took MC 85/Buckeye Road east through Goodyear and Avondale into Phoenix.
From Buckeye Road, US 80 travelled north on 17th Avenue, then east on Van Buren Street through the Phoenix metro area. Van Buren changes its name several times to Mill Avenue in Tempe, Main Street in Mesa and Apache Trail/Old West Highway through Apache Junction, before US 80 joined the route of US 60 to Florence Junction. Today, US 80 from Florence Junction through Florence to Tucson consists of AZ 79, AZ 79 Business and AZ 77 south of Oracle Junction. In Tucson, US 80 continued south on Oracle Road past West Miracle Mile. The highway used Drachman Street, Stone Avenue, 6th Avenue and Benson Highway to I-10 east of town.

For the most part, US 80 followed I-10 east to Benson. Near Vail, an older section of US 80 still exists as the north frontage road and Marsh Station Road. In Benson, US 80 took I-10 Business to AZ 80, where it headed southeast to Tombstone. AZ 80 takes its number from the former U.S. Highway and makes up the majority of the former route through Cochise County through Tombstone, Bisbee and Douglas to NM 80 at the New Mexico state line. The earlier routing in Bisbee took Old Divide Road and Main Street through town, while the older Douglas route used G Avenue, 10th Street and A Avenue.

US 80 had a major impact on developing Arizona&#x27;s car culture and at times, would compete with US 66 In overall popularity. At one point in the mid-1950s, more people entered California through Arizona on US 80 than on US 66. In Tucson there are over 281 extant historic motels and structures along the original US 80 alignment, especially on the Miracle Mile and Benson Highway segments. Part of former US 80 through Tucson was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2017 as the Miracle Mile Historic District. On September 21, 2018, the Arizona Transportation Board designated the old alignment of US 80 as a state Historic Road connecting with the designation in California. The alignment was nominated by the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation.

===New Mexico===

Through New Mexico, US 80 travelled through Lordsburg, New Mexico, Deming and Las Cruces. Between 1989 and 1991, US 80 was removed from New Mexico since it was supplanted almost entirely by I-10.

US 80 entered New Mexico on present day NM 80 passing through Rodeo before heading north to join the route of I-10 at Road Forks. Between Road Forks and the Texas border, US 80 was often the subject of major realignment.

The later routings generally follow what is now I-10, US 70, US 180 and I-10 Business through Lordsburg and Deming, between Road Forks and Las Cruces. From Las Cruces, US 80 used Valley Drive, the I-10 west frontage road and NM 460 to reach SH 20 in Texas.

The older routings utilized a now abandoned roadway between the Union Pacific Railroad and I-10 from Road Forks to Deming. Older US 80 followed present day I-10 Business and US 70 through Lordsburg. The older route through Deming followed NM 418 into Deming, then east on Spruce Street, I-10 Business/US 180 and NM 549 through Cambray back to I-10. Where NM 549 takes on the form of the south frontage road, US 80 followed a now abandoned railbed northwest of Cambray for a short distance before rejoining the route of NM 549. Older US 80 then followed US 70 and NM 478 through Las Cruces to NM 460 and SH 20 at the Texas border.

===Texas===


From the New Mexico border, US 80 (concurrent with US 85) formerly passed through the Mesilla Valley communities of Anthony, Vinton, and Canutillo. State Highway 20 (SH 20) follows the original US 80/US 85 route. I-10 bypassed the original US 80 routing in western El Paso County, and now parallels the old US 80 route a few miles east until crossing it at the current junction with SH 20, where I-10 continues through El Paso, then heads off southeast towards San Antonio. SH 20 follows the old alignment of US 80 until downtown El Paso. Exiting El Paso, I-10 mostly follows the former routing of US 80, but bypassing smaller towns in the Trans-Pecos that were formerly on US 80 (such as Van Horn). I-10 then has a junction with I-20 outside of Kent. I-20 then follows former US 80 all the way to Fort Worth, bypassing many old sections of US 80 on the way. They are as follows:

*SH 20 from New Mexico via El Paso to I-10 near McNary, bypassed 1969
*Business Interstate 10-C (Bus. I-10-C) through Sierra Blanca (originally Loop 416 and Business U.S. Highway 80, Bus. US 80), bypassed 1965
*Bus. I-10-D through Van Horn (originally Loop 51 and Bus. US 80), bypassed 1975
*Bus. I-20-B through Pecos and Barstow, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
*Spur 57 through Pyote and Wickett, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
*Bus. I-20-D through Monahans, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
*Bus. I-20-E through Odessa and Midland, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
**Spur 268 and SH 158 through downtown Midland (originally Bus. US 80), bypassed in 1953
*Business Interstate 20-F through Stanton (originally Loop 214), part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
*Bus. I-20-G through Big Spring (originally Loop 402 and Bus. US 80), bypassed 1965
*Bus. I-20-H through Westbrook (originally Loop 333), bypassed 1958
*Bus. I-20-J through Colorado City (originally Loop 377 and Bus. US 80), bypassed 1963
*Bus. I-20-K through Loraine (originally Loop 316), bypassed 1957
*Bus. I-20-L through Roscoe (originally Loop 237), bypassed 1959
*Loop 170 past Sweetwater Municipal Airport, bypassed 1946
*Bus. I-20-M through Sweetwater (originally Loop 432 and Bus. US 80), bypassed 1966
*Bus. I-20-N through Trent (originally Loop 319), bypassed 1957
*Bus. I-20-P through Merkel (originally Loop 39), bypassed 1959
*Bus. I-20-Q through Tye (originally Loop 320), bypassed 1957

*FM 2945 west of Cisco, bypassed 1964
*SH 206, SH 6 and SH 112 through Cisco and Eastland, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
*Farm to Market Road 3363 (FM 3363) through Olden, bypassed 1976
*Loop 254 through Ranger, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation
*Spur 312 and US 180 through Weatherford, part of US 80 until its 1991 truncation

In Fort Worth, I-20 breaks off the old US 80 route at I-30&#x27;s junction with I-20, which is also I-30&#x27;s western terminus. Just east of the junction, I-30 leaves the pre-1991 route of US 80, now Spur 580. Old US 80 travels due east on Spur 580 to US 377 (Camp Bowie Boulevard), where it heads northeast to the junction with I-30. At I-30, US 377 and former US 80 join the freeway into downtown Fort Worth; the old route—along Camp Bowie Boulevard and Lancaster Avenue—was once Bus. US 80.

The old route along Camp Bowie Boulevard in Fort Worth turned onto Lancaster Avenue to follow it to SH 180 under the Interstate 35W and Interstate 30 freeways, where the highway begins and follows SH 180 on Lancaster Avenue in Fort Worth, Division Street in Arlington, Main Street in Grand Prairie and Davis Street in Dallas.

Just east of downtown Fort Worth, US 80 split from I-30 onto present SH 180 until 1991. Approaching downtown Dallas, the older route of US 80 used Fort Worth Avenue and Commerce Street, designated Loop 260 and Bus. US 80 in 1952. (US 80 had bypassed that route by 1939, but it was SH 1 until 1952.) The later US 80 continued east on Davis Street, turning north at Zang Boulevard (Loop 354 until 1991), shifting to a route via SH 180 to I-35E after 1961. Through and east of downtown, the route before it was rerouted onto present I-30 used Commerce Street, Parry Avenue, Haskell Avenue, Grand Avenue and Samuell Boulevard. (This was not assigned a number or a business route designation when it was bypassed.) In eastern Dallas, the old route merges with the present freeway at Town East Boulevard, shortly after present US 80 begins at the split from I-30. US 80 eastbound, that ran from Fort Worth Avenue to Zang Boulevard near Oak Cliff along SH 180 in Dallas, made a left turn onto Zang Boulevard to follow it onto the Jefferson Viaduct and Market Street to make a right onto Commerce Street. Westbound US 80 turned off of Elm Street to go onto Houston Street to follow it, the Houston Street Viaduct and Zang Boulevard all the way to Davis Street (SH 180), where it turned right to follow it from there to Camp Bowie Boulevard in Fort Worth. In downtown Dallas, US 80 followed Commerce Street eastbound and Elm Street westbound. On Commerce Street in Dallas, US 80 goes onto Second Avenue to follow it to Main Street where it makes a left turn onto Main Street and a left onto First Avenue to head onto Robert B Cullum Boulevard to merge onto eastbound I-30/US 67 to follow that all the way to present US 80. Westbound US 80 breaks away from westbound I-30/US 67 to head onto First Avenue to make a left on Exposition Avenue to head onto Elm Street where it goes left to follow it into downtown Dallas.

FM 688 is the old alignment through Forney, bypassed in 1959 by the present freeway. Most of this route was a spur of FM 740 until 1960.

===Louisiana===

US 80 was routed along the existing Dixie Overland Highway throughout Louisiana. Since 1921, this auto trail had also carried the designations of State Route 1 west of Shreveport and State Route 4 from Shreveport eastward. These routes remained co-signed with US 80 until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. The few significant changes to the alignment of US 80 over the years have resulted from the addition or replacement of bridges along the route, improvements that were largely carried out during the 1930s and the mid-1950s. The biggest project involved the construction of the first Vicksburg Bridge across the Mississippi River in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Item 4/29/1930&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Item 10/7/1931&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by new bridges across the Red River at Shreveport–Bossier City (Long–Allen Bridge, 1933) and the Ouachita River in Monroe (P.M. Atkins Bridge, 1936).&lt;ref name=&quot;Item 10/29/1933&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Item 5/1/1936&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, new alignments carried traffic eastward from the bridges, bypassing the original routes through Bossier City and downtown Monroe. Minor relocation of the highway has also resulted from overpasses replacing several at-grade railroad crossings, as US 80 parallels what is now the Kansas City Southern Railway throughout the state.
The opening of I-20 parallel to US 80 occurred in stages between 1960 and 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;T-P 4/24/1960&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S-I 6/2/1977&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This gradually transformed US 80 from being the major highway across northern Louisiana to serving local traffic along the I-20 corridor. However, the highway has remained physically independent from I-20 with one exception. In 1980, the closing of the old Vicksburg Bridge to vehicular traffic resulted in US 80 being shifted onto the newer I-20 Vicksburg Bridge to cross the Mississippi River.

===Alabama===
What is now US 80 in Alabama was previously designated as Alabama State Road 26 (SR 26) between 1924 and 1928. During the 1928 Alabama State Route renumbering, pre-1928 SR 26 was replaced by Alabama State Route 8 (SR 8). Today, SR 8 is still the internal designation for US 80 throughout the state, except for the section bypassing Selma (which is part of SR 14 and SR 41) and the westernmost section in the western part of the state, concurrent with US 11 (designated as SR 7). The segments of SR 8 not part of US 80 are an unsigned spur between SR 8&#x27;s western terminus at I-20 and the US 80 Business route through Selma. The current routing of US 80 between Cuba and Livingston was originally designated as SR 162. US 80 generally followed the route of present-day SR 28 and US 11 between Cuba and Livingston. In 1955, US 80 was moved onto this newer highway, which was more direct and bypassed Coatopa, Livingston and York. The transition of US 80 and SR 8 to the new highway effectively retired the SR 162 designation. Despite the Dixie Overland Highway no longer being an active highway, the state of Alabama still legally recognizes the entire length of US 80 through the state under this name.
In 1965, the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then part of US 80, was the site of the infamous Bloody Sunday event. The Alabama National Guard, Selma and Dallas County law enforcement as well as armed non-law enforcement individuals brutally beat and trampled Civil Rights protesters with police batons, horses and barbed wire bats, bringing a pre-mature end to an attempted march to Montgomery. The brutality was captured on national television, sparking nationwide outrage regarding the abuse suffered by the protesters. Following Bloody Sunday, the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches followed US 80 between the two cities. In 1996, this route was designated by the National Park Service as the Selma to Montgomery National Voting Rights Trail. An interpretive center is located along the route in Lowndes County and the various sites used as campgrounds are marked along the route. Today, the old section of US 80 through Selma, including the Edmund Pettus Bridge, is signed as US 80 Business.

<text>Old Compton Street is a road that runs east–west through Soho in the West End of London, named after Henry Compton who raised funds for St Anne&#x27;s Church in 1686. The area, particularly this street, became home to French Protestant refugees in 1681. Known for its diverse and artistic traditions, the street housed businesses, artists, philosophers, and was frequented by communists and proto-beatniks. The Algerian Coffee Stores, one of the oldest shops on the street, was established in 1887. Post World War II, the street became a center for modern and trad jazz. Since the 1970s, Old Compton Street has been a focal point for London&#x27;s gay community, with numerous gay bars, restaurants, and specialty shops. The Admiral Duncan pub, a notable gay venue, was bombed in 1999 in a hate crime attack. The street is also home to the Prince Edward Theatre.

==History==


The street was named after Henry Compton who raised funds for a local parish church, eventually dedicated as St Anne&#x27;s Church in 1686. The area in general and this street, in particular, became the home of Huguenots, French Protestant refugees who were given asylum in England by Charles II in 1681.

The street was known simply as Compton Street until being renamed to Old Compton Street in 1896. By the end of the eighteenth century and until that renaming, the east end of the street between Greek Street and Charing Cross Road (at the time, Crown Street) was known as Little Compton Street. A street sign for Little Compton Street remains on the wall of a utility tunnel that runs beneath Charing Cross Road, and is visible through a street grate on a traffic island.

By the end of the 18th century, fewer than ten of the houses were without shop fronts. An 1818 trade directory shows that the businesses occupying premises in the street included several watch and clock makers, a bookseller, a straw hat maker, a surgeon and , an undertaker, a mathematical instrument maker, a bedding warehouse, several grocers and two &quot;dealers in curiosities&quot;.
In the middle of the 19th century, while there were some workshops too, as well as restaurants and public houses, the ground floors of most of the houses were still used as shops. The number of people of overseas descent continued to grow and the street became a meeting place for exiles, particularly those from France: after the suppression of the Paris Commune, the poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine often frequented drinking haunts here. Richard Wagner also spent time living on the street: more generally it became a home for artists, philosophers, bohemians and composers.
In 1887, M. Siari, an Algerian, established the Algerian Coffee Stores at number 52, still known as among the world&#x27;s best leading suppliers of tea and coffee, which remains up to now one of the oldest shops in the street.

The street&#x27;s radical and artistic traditions continued after World War II, with it being frequented by communists, proto-beatniks and existentialists, and it became a centre for modern and trad jazz.

Between 1956 and 1970 the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar was located at number 59. Many well-known 1960s pop musicians played in its cramped surroundings.

==Current==
Since the 1970s, the street has become a focal point for London&#x27;s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. It features several gay bars, gay-friendly restaurants, cafés and specialist gay shops. Whilst a pedestrianisation project proved unpopular with local traders and was reversed, the street is closed to vehicular traffic for the Soho Pride festival one weekend each year, usually in late summer.
The Prince Edward Theatre is located at the eastern end of the street. Until 2004 the long-running production of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, a musical based upon the songs of ABBA, was showing at the theatre. When &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; moved to larger premises in another part of the West End, a production of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; moved in, but closed in 2008. It subsequently became home to &quot;Aladdin&quot; and in 2019 a revival of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. London producer and director Adam Spreadbury-Maher lives at the northern end of Old Compton Street.
In 1999, the Admiral Duncan pub, a well-known gay venue, was the site of a terrorist nail bomb attack which killed three people and injured over a dozen. A neo-nazi, David Copeland, was subsequently found guilty of the bombing (intended specifically to injure members of the gay community). Previously decorated in neutral colours, Admiral Duncan was re-opened following the attack with a flamboyant pink and purple exterior with a large rainbow flag flying outside as a symbol of gay pride.

Along the street are various other gay bars including Comptons of SOHO and G-A-Y. Also on the street are a variety of cafés, tea rooms (including the original cafe that gave its name to the Patisserie Valerie chain), restaurants including Bincho, a yakitori restaurant, Balans (which is open 24 hours a day), and specialist sex shops.

<text>U.S. Route 380 (US 380) is an east–west United States highway. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Greenville, Texas at an intersection with Interstate 30, of which the easternmost 3–4 miles are concurrent with US 69 in a loop around the west and south sides of Greenville. Its western terminus is at San Antonio, New Mexico, south of Socorro at an intersection with Interstate 25. It intersected with its parent, U.S. Route 80, at Cisco until 1971, when it was rerouted along the former SH 24 from that highway&#x27;s western terminus near Old Glory to Greenville. Former U.S. Route 380 from Cisco to near Old Glory became an extension of SH 6. The highway no longer connects to any x80 route. US 380 passes through some of the far northern suburbs of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, including (from west to east) Denton, Frisco, McKinney and Princeton. The portion in Texas from the New Mexico state line to Jayton was SH 84 before 1939. Its spur, SH 84A, went from Jayton to Aspermont, until 1930, when it became SH 161.

==Route description==

===New Mexico===

US Route 380 begins at an intersection with Interstate 25 just west of San Antonio, New Mexico, and travels through town, meeting the old route of US 85, now New Mexico State Road 1. It then travels generally east, and marks the northern edge of the White Sands Missile Range. The road then turns southeast, crossing the Carrizozo Malpais before reaching Carrizozo, meeting U.S. Route 54. The route continues southeast, climbing the Sacramento Mountains, and going through the town of Capitan and briefly travelling through the Lincoln National Forest, before reaching U.S. Route 70 at Hondo and becoming concurrent with US 70.
These routes continue eastward, next reaching Roswell, New Mexico. US 380 splits with US 70 in Roswell, then crossing U.S. Route 285 in Roswell before continuing east across oil-producing areas of the Llano Estacado of east New Mexico and the Texas South Plains.

===Texas===
US 380 enters Texas at a crossing with Farm to Market Road 769, travelling generally due east before meeting up with US Route 82 in Plains. They continue east passing the former locations of Tokio and Gomez before reaching Brownfield. In Brownfield, it meets US Routes 62 and 385, and all 4 routes coincide for 3 blocks through the center of town before US 380 splits to the east.
The route continues due east through Texas South Plains farmland, passing through Tahoka, before falling off the Llano Estacado and reaching Post. The highway then meanders east through rural Garza and Kent Counties before reaching the ghost town of Clairemont. The route then travels east, where it meets Texas State Highway 70, which both then turn northeast until reaching Jayton, where US 380 takes a sharp turn back to the southeast. The road then travels through several thousand acres of private ranchland in Kent and Stonewall Counties before reaching Swenson.
The route continues to the southeast, reaching an intersection with US 83, where both continue southeast into the town of Aspermont. The route continues to the east and northeast through the communities of Old Glory, Rule, Haskell, Throckmorton, and Newcastle, before crossing Lake Graham and reaching the city of Graham.

US 380 continues to the east and northeast through Bryson before reaching an intersection with US Route 281 and Texas State Highway 114 in Jacksboro. US 281 departs southward out of town, while US 380 and TX 114 depart east south of Jacksboro, crossing Lake Bridgeport before reaching the city of Bridgeport. US 380 then travels due east toward the city of Decatur.

US 380 exits to the east and reaches an intersection with Interstate 35 on the west end of Denton where it is known as University Drive. US 380 continues through the city of Denton, intersecting US Route 77 and US 377 near Texas Woman&#x27;s University, before continuing east with US 377. The routes cross the very northern edge of Lake Lewisville before US 377 departs off to the north. US 380 continues east through the town of Cross Roads and the city of Little Elm. Then US380 meets the northern terminus of the Dallas North Tollway in Frisco, before reaching McKinney, where it is also known as University Drive. The route then continues east, passing through Princeton before crossing the northern fringe of Lake Lavon, and reaching Farmersville, where it is signed as the Audie Murphy Parkway. The route again continues east, passing just south of Floyd, before reaching an intersection with US Route 69 on the far western edge of Greenville. Both of those routes then follow a loop around the south end of Greenville, before reaching the routes eastern terminus at an intersection with Interstate 30 and US Route 67.

==Special routes==
The route has two special routes, both business routes in Texas.
===U.S. Route 380 Business - F===
This is the former route of US 380 through the city of Decatur. The route was bypassed in 1987, with the old route being renamed Texas State Highway Loop 569. The route was re-designated as the business route in 1991.
===U.S. Route 380 Business - J===
This is the former route of US 380 through the town of Floyd. The route was bypassed in 1968, when the route was still known as Texas State Highway 24, with the old routing being designated as Texas State Highway Loop 462. The route was re-designated as the business route in 1991.

==History==
When US 380 was commissioned in 1931, it took over the entire former route of U.S. Route 566, an original 1926 route. The entire route of US 566 was within the state of New Mexico, from an intersection with (modern day New Mexico State Road 48) and (modern-day US 70) east of Ruidoso to US 85 (originally planned as US 466) in Socorro, New Mexico. US 566 never intersected with its nominal parent, U.S. Route 66 although it temporarily connected to that parent indirectly via U.S. Route 366.

The section of highway from the New Mexico state line to Jayton was previously SH 84. A spur route, SH 84A, went from Jayton to Aspermont, being changed to Texas State Highway 161 in 1930.

US 380 east of Denton, and west of McKinney, has had numerous fatal vehicle accidents, per public statements by law enforcement and fire department officials. This is believed to be attributed by the lack of a center median, high traffic volume, and excessive speeds.

<doc id="428925" wikidata="Q98754535" url="?curid=428925" title="Noovo">
<text>Noovo is a Canadian French-language terrestrial television network owned by the Bell Media subsidiary of BCE Inc. The network has five owned-and-operated and three affiliated stations throughout Quebec. It can also be seen over-the-air in some bordering markets in the provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick, and in some other parts of Canada on cable television or direct broadcast satellite.

The network was launched in 1986 as Télévision Quatre-Saisons (TQS), and was known by that name until Remstar, which had bought the network in 2008, renamed it V on August 31, 2009. It was the namesake and flagship property of V Media Group (now known as Remstar Media Group), a separate company majority-owned by Remstar owner Maxime Rémillard (partially through Remstar). V was acquired by Bell Media in May 2020, after which it was renamed Noovo on August 31, 2020. The name &quot;Noovo&quot; is a stylized phonetic spelling of &quot;nouveau&quot;, the French word for &quot;new&quot;.

==History==
In 1968, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) first expressed interest in the establishment of a third French-language commercial television service in the province of Quebec to compete with Télévision de Radio-Canada and the loose association of independent stations that eventually became TVA. However the CRTC did not call on applications for licences.

In 1972, the CRTC said it was prepared to receive licence applications in order to authorize a third commercial television service in Quebec, although it was not until 1974 when the CRTC granted licences to Télé Inter-Cité Québec Ltée. to operate TV stations in Montreal (channel 29) and in Quebec City (channel 2). Télé Inter-Cité found itself unable to launch the network due to materials shortages and delays in equipment delivery; the CRTC granted a time extension to 1976. Civitas Corp., owner of several radio stations in Quebec and a denied applicant for the same channels a year earlier, filed to buy Téle Inter-Cité, but the CRTC denied the purchase and noted that the proposal to reduce local programming commitments substantially altered the original accepted application. Unable to go forward due to what it called &quot;economic reasons&quot;, the firm surrendered the licences for revocation in 1976.

On November 15, 1984, the CRTC launched another call for applications in response to a bid from Cogeco. In 1985, it held public hearings in Montreal to examine competing applications from partners Cogeco Inc. (60.3%) and Moffat Communications (39.7%), and another application by the Pouliot family, owners of Montreal&#x27;s CTV affiliate, CFCF-TV and radio stations CFCF (later CINW, now defunct) and CFQR-FM (now CKBE-FM). Both applications applied to launch television stations in Montreal and Quebec City. On September 6 of that year, the CRTC approved the application of the Pouliot family and its company, Réseau de Télévision Quatre-Saisons Inc., noting its existing facilities in Montreal and more realistic revenue projections compared to Cogeco. TQS was authorized to operate a French-language TV station in Montreal with an effective radiated power of 566,000 watts on channel 35. The CRTC initially denied the Quebec City bid on grounds of insufficient local advertising revenue; it was, however, allowed to set up a full-time rebroadcaster of the Montreal station there.

The network launched on September 7, 1986, as Télévision Quatre-Saisons (&quot;Four Seasons Television&quot;). The flagship was CFJP-TV in Montreal, with CFAP-TV in Quebec City as a full-time rebroadcaster. The network had affiliates in five other cities. As part of the launch, the existing expansion plans to add two storeys to the CFCF building were expanded with another two floors. The network—already lean, employing 125 additional personnel on top of CFCF&#x27;s 500—spent most of its earlier years in severe financial trouble. At one point, the revenues from CFCF-TV were all that were keeping the network afloat. It was, however, able to launch affiliates in Val-d&#x27;Or in 1987 and Rivière-du-Loup in 1988, as well as upgrade its Quebec City rebroadcaster to a full-fledged station in 1989. In its early years, it was known for advertising in English on its then-sister radio stations.

In 1995, the Pouliots sold their media holdings to Quebec cable company Vidéotron, who already owned TVA, Quebec&#x27;s other private commercial network. Due to monopoly ownership concerns, Vidéotron immediately turned around and sold TQS to Quebecor, a newspaper publisher. Around this time, the network began branding primarily as &quot;TQS&quot;; for its first decade on the air, most verbal references had used &quot;Quatre-Saisons.&quot;

Quebecor acquired Vidéotron in 2001, and put TQS back on the market. Later in 2001, TQS was bought by a joint venture of CTVglobemedia (then known as Bell Globemedia) and Cogeco, another cable company. Cogeco owned a 60 percent controlling interest in the venture and handled most of operations, while CTVglobemedia owned 40 percent. The acquisition, in a sense, reunited it with CFCF, which had been bought by CTV a year earlier.

===Bankruptcy protection===
On December 18, 2007, TQS filed for bankruptcy protection. At this point the network was given 30 days in which to reorganize and revamp itself, with the goal of finding a viable solution to pay off its creditors. On January 16, 2008, a judge extended the grace period for an additional 45 days.

Montreal&#x27;s newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot; reported on January 15 that Rogers Communications and RNC Media were each interested in acquiring some individual stations within the network, although RNC Media later denied the report and Rogers declined to comment. On February 25, 2008, the network confirmed that it had received four purchase bids, although it did not disclose the identities of the bidders.

=== Remstar&#x27;s takeover ===
On March 10, 2008, the Quebec Superior Court approved the sale of TQS to Remstar Corporation, a Montreal-based television and film producer and distributor. Creditors, who were owed more than $33 million, voted to accept the Remstar proposal in May. The CRTC approved the application on June 26, 2008.

Remstar announced on April 23, 2008, that 270 jobs would be cut at TQS, while the information services division would be abolished entirely — thus eliminating all newscasts from the network starting in September 2008. While the CRTC ordered Remstar to retain local news programming on the network, it did take the network&#x27;s precarious financial situation into account by allowing a reduced amount of local news programming until the network&#x27;s licence renewal hearing in 2011.

At the network&#x27;s fall upfronts presentation for 2009, the network announced a repositioning plan, including a shedding of the TQS moniker and its black sheep logo in favour of the name &quot;V&quot;, complete with a black-and-gold circle logo with a stylized letter V. The V name reflected the channel&#x27;s new mission of &quot;vedettes&quot; (stars), &quot;vitesse&quot; (speed), &quot;voyages&quot; (trips), and &quot;vice ou vérité&quot; (vices or truths). Some people jokingly hypothesised that &quot;V&quot; was chosen to honor Rémillard&#x27;s then girlfriend, Karine Vanasse. 

The new program lineup included the daily news and discussion programs &quot;Le show du matin&quot;, hosted by Gildor Roy, and &quot;Dumont 360&quot;, hosted by Mario Dumont. V&#x27;s rebranding took effect on August 31, 2009, at 6 am ET after the infomercial block.

=== Sale to Bell Media ===
In July 2019, V Media Group announced that the network would be sold to CTVglobemedia&#x27;s successor Bell Media pending CRTC approval, leaving the company to focus on its specialty channels Elle Fictions and Max. Bell proposed the addition of expanded in-house news programming, and will also provide advertising and master control services for Elle Fictions and Max.

The sale was approved on April 3, 2020; as a condition of the purchase, the CRTC stated that all five V stations must air five hours of local programming per-week through the 2020-2021 broadcast year, and expanding to eight-and-a-half hours per-week in Montreal and Quebec City by 2021–2022. At least half of all local programming must be locally-reflective. The sale was closed on May 15, 2020.

On August 19, 2020, Bell Media announced that the network would be rebranded as Noovo on August 31, taking its name from V&#x27;s streaming platform of the same name.

==Programming==
The network has long been a distant third in the ratings to TVA and Ici Radio-Canada Télé. During the analogue era, most of its affiliates operated on the UHF band, and operated at moderate-to-low power compared to their TVA and Radio-Canada counterparts. Even in digital, most V affiliates do not have nearly the reach of their TVA and Radio-Canada counterparts. However, it has produced a number of major hit series in Quebec.

===News===
From the network&#x27;s launch to its 2008 restructuring, the nightly &quot;Le Grand Journal&quot; formed the core of Noovo&#x27;s news programming when it was named TQS. As with the channel per-se, Le Grand Journal failed to establish itself as a hard competitor to the very popular TVA and Radio-Canada newscasts, trying on several different formats to mixed success; however, it launched the careers of many Quebec TV news presenters who would later land bigger jobs at other radio and TV outlets.

The newscast would become a factor on the ratings when popular anchor and political commentator Jean-Luc Mongrain was hired as lead presenter in 1999, and the show adopted a harded-edge, tabloid and more aggressive approach, with a mix of hard news, commentary and heavy viewer interaction; the move coincided with TQS moving all of its daily programming to a street-front studio at Quebecor&#x27;s headquarters. He anchored the program from August 30, 1999, until its final edition aired on August 29, 2008.

The 10 p.m. edition, presented by Denis Lévesque, became increasingly known for its aggressive and often confrontative debates on hot topics, leading to it regularly beating Le Téléjournal on the ratings. Lévesque left TQS shortly before the start of the 2005 season, over a controversy regarding the hiring of presenter Isabelle Maréchal to serve as commentator and newsreader; in an interview with La Presse, he told he didn&#x27;t want to do &quot;spectacle information&quot;, as Maréchal was mostly known for presenting entertainment programming. Eventually, she anchored the 10 p.m. edition during that season, before being replaced by Benoît Dutrizac, freshly hired from Télé-Québec, who anchored a 10 p.m. news talk show, &quot;Dutrizac&quot;, focusing on interviews and analysis, with the news element relegated to the final part of the slot. The format was not a success, with a conventional news bulletin reinstated in 2007, with Esther Bégin being hired from LCN and presenting it until the closure of the news service.

News programming continued in a reduced form on V, however, outsourced to independent producer ADN5. News summaries of approximately three minutes were inserted into the network&#x27;s morning and noontime programming, along with a 30-minute newscast weekend evenings. In 2012, the provision on news programming was taken over by a newly formed production division of Montreal-based publishing company Transcontinental, which took over the production of these updates, alongside producing a newly created news-oriented morning show, &quot;Ça commence bien !&quot;, which attempted to attract viewers away from TVA&#x27;s &quot;Salut, Bonjour!&quot; by showcasing content from the group&#x27;s print and magazine brands. Even after suffering three different host transitions and numerous format changes to make it look closer to its rival, the show would be ultimately unsuccessful and eventually cancelled in 2015. By 2017, the network&#x27;s news programming evolved after production was taken over by another producer, Attraction Images, now as a full-fledged half-hour bulletin under the title &quot;NVL&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;nouvelles&quot;, the French term for news), featuring a voiceover anchorless format that blended both network-wide and regionalized news reports similar to the current format of &quot;CityNews&quot; on the English Canadian Citytv network.

As part of the sale to Bell Media, the company stated that it planned to add in-house newscasts on all five O&amp;O stations, with 90 minutes per-day on weekdays in Montreal and Quebec City, 60 minutes elsewhere, and half-hour weekend newscasts in all markets. On March 11, 2021, Bell announced the details of its revamp of the network&#x27;s news programming under the title &quot;Le Fil (&quot;). The new in-house program, which replaced the outsourced &quot;NVL&quot;, debuted on March 29, airing twice daily on weekdays: an hour-long news block at 5 p.m., with a half-hour national edition anchored by Noémi Mercier from the Bell Media building at Papineau Avenue in Montreal, followed by half-hour regional editions anchored by Mercier in Montreal, and by Lisa-Marie Blais in Quebec City; and a half-hour block at 10 p.m., consisting of ten minutes of national headlines anchored by Michel Bherer, followed by 20 minutes of regional news anchored by Bherer in Montreal and by Blais in Quebec City. On weekends, a single national edition airs at 9 a.m., structured more as a newsmagazine than as a newscast, anchored by Meeker Guerrier in Montreal. The network&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations carry their own regional editions, all broadcast from a centralised studio in Quebec City with Blais anchoring, but still featuring footage and two-ways from locally based reporters; its affiliate stations will continue to produce their own local newscasts in lieu of the regional editions.

Lacking the resources of its well-established competitors, Noovo is leveraging the resources of the Énergie, Rouge and Boom-branded local radio stations owned by Bell Media to complement its own reporting; the combined resources are being promoted under the Noovo Info moniker. &quot;Le Fil&quot; would have a more informal and personality-based style in comparison to its competitors, with a focus on long-form and human interest stories, analysis and commentary, as well as viewer interaction on social media. Initial reviews were mixed, praising the story selection and unique presentation, but criticising the over-recycling of segments and lack of appropriate imagery during news briefs, as well as no international news, sports or weather segments. Due to low ratings, the early evening edition began adding over time some more conventional elements to increase the pace, whilst retaining some of the magazine elements, making it closer to a conventional newscast.

In May 2022, Mercier announced her departure from &quot;Le Fil&quot; after signing a deal with Bell Media to produce and present long-form documentaries for the network; she was later replaced by former LCN anchor and TVA reporter Marie-Christine Bergeron, who took over the anchor chair on August 29. The appointment of Bergeron led to the broadcast increasingly taking on a more conventional format, with more live reports and breaking news coverage; additionally, Michel Bherer began presenting a debate and analysis program, &quot;Les débatteurs de Noovo&quot;, after the late edition of &quot;Le Fil&quot;, which launched on September 12.

On August 28, 2023, Noovo renamed its news bulletin to &quot;Noovo Info&quot; () to align its online and its TV news operations.

In August 2024, Marie-Claude Paradis-Desfossés, a journalist formerly associated with TVA Nouvelles, was announced as joining &quot;Noovo Info&quot;. In the same month, the network also reintroduced a half-hour noon newscast, titled &quot;Noovo Info 12&quot;.

In December 2024, Bell Media announced that it would merge its French- and English-language newsrooms in Quebec, bringing the Noovo Info and radio news operations together with CTV News and CJAD.

===Sports===
Noovo has long aired a nighttime sports show, beginning with &quot;Sports Plus&quot; (1986–1998), then &quot;110%&quot; (1998–2009), followed by &quot;L&#x27;attaque à 5&quot; (2009–2010).

Its carriage of live sporting events began with Super Bowl XXI in 1987. It has carried games of the National Hockey League, including the Quebec Nordiques from 1988 to 1994 and the Montreal Canadiens from 1994 to 2002. It also aired games of the Montreal Expos from 1994 to 1998. Noovo carries boxing events organized by Groupe Yvon Michel.

In February 2005, the network acquired rights to the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics as part of Canada&#x27;s Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium (a joint venture of CTVglobemedia and Rogers Media) as the French broadcast television partner, in partnership with RDS (a sister via CTVglobemedia&#x27;s stake at the time). It shared morning coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics with RDS, followed by its own afternoon and evening programming. As the network&#x27;s carriage was limited outside of Quebec (unlike previous rights holder Télévision de Radio-Canada), the non-profit public affairs network CPAC (which has must-carry status nationwide) received special authorization from the CRTC to simulcast the coverage in order to ensure nationwide availability.

The network is known to many viewers for &quot;Bleu Nuit&quot;, a showcase of softcore pornography which formerly broadcast late Saturday nights, similar to &quot;The Baby Blue Movie&quot; that once aired on Toronto&#x27;s Citytv.

===Prime time===
The network&#x27;s prime time schedule currently consists predominantly of reality and non-fiction programming, scheduled around Julie Snyder&#x27;s nightly talk show &quot;La Semaine des 4 Julie&quot; (The Week of the 4 Julies) at 9 p.m. Scripted entertainment programming currently consists primarily of dubbed versions of English Canadian or American comedy or drama series, rather than original francophone comedy or drama; however, a few Quebec-produced comedy or drama series are also broadcast, including &quot;Pour toujours, plus un jour&quot; (Forever, Not Another Day), &quot;Mon ex à moi&quot; (My Ex), &quot;Entre deux draps&quot; (Pillow Talk) and &quot;Max et Livia&quot; (Max and Livia).

===Programming outside Montreal and Quebec City===
Since the rebranding of the TQS network to V, on August 31, 2009, V&#x27;s three owned and operated stations (O&amp;Os) outside Montreal and Quebec City have dropped all non-network programming and become de facto repeaters of flagship CFJP-DT in Montreal. Unlike O&amp;O stations, non-owned affiliates of the network, such as CFGS-DT in Gatineau/Ottawa, CJPC-DT in Rimouski, CFTF-DT in Rivière-du-Loup and CFVS-DT in Val-d&#x27;Or/Rouyn-Noranda, continue to broadcast local programming.

==Coverage==
Unlike TVA, Noovo does not have mandatory cable carriage rights outside Quebec, but may be offered at a cable company&#x27;s discretion if there is a sufficient local market for French-language television programming. Consequently, the network is not widely available outside Quebec, although some communities in Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia receive Noovo affiliates on cable.

CFGS-DT in Gatineau is part of the Ottawa television market, and is carried in both analogue and digital on cable systems in nearly all of Eastern Ontario. Eastlink systems in Northeastern Ontario also carry CFGS in both analogue and digital. Rogers Cable systems in Central and Southwestern Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area, offer CFGS on their digital tier. CFTF-DT in Rivière-du-Loup has a rebroadcaster in Edmundston, New Brunswick—the network&#x27;s only over-the-air transmitter outside Quebec—and is carried in both analogue and digital across most of northern New Brunswick.

To ensure that the network&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics reached francophone viewers outside Quebec, its coverage was simulcast on CPAC, which has mandatory carriage on the basic service of all Canadian cable and satellite providers, from February 12 to 28, 2010.

==Identity and slogans==
Beginning in 1997, TQS branded itself as &quot;le mouton noir de la télé&quot; (), a slogan that could have served as the network&#x27;s acknowledgment (or perhaps a badge of pride) that its history of financial difficulties, edgy programming, and limited availability outside Quebec had not always given it a prestigious place in the TV industry or in the eyes of the viewing public. The black sheep slogan was discontinued with the network&#x27;s rebranding from TQS to V at the end of August 2009.

*1987-1989: On grandit ensemble! &quot;(Growing together!)&quot;
*1989-1995: TQS Au coeur de l&#x27;action! &quot;(TQS At the heart of the action!)
*1990: Voyez comme c&#x27;est bon! (See how good it is!)
*1995-1997: Allumée! &quot;(Turned on!)&quot; (Literally, &quot;Lit up!&quot;)
*1997-2007, 2008-2009: Le mouton noir de la télé &quot;(The black sheep of TV)&quot;
*2007: Parce que vous êtes... différent! &quot;(Because you are... different!)&quot;
*2009-2010: Laissez-vous divertir &quot;(Let yourself be entertained)&quot;, to coincide with the rebranding to V on August 31, 2009.
*2010: Le divertissement à la puissance V &quot;(Entertainment to the power of V)&quot;

==Revenue==

Noovo has a 21% revenue share of the French-speaking private television market. The private francophone sector generates revenue of $361 million which equates to $75 million for Noovo.

<text>The Australian Mounted Division originally formed as the Imperial Mounted Division in January 1917, was a mounted infantry, light horse and yeomanry division. The division was formed in Egypt, and along with the Anzac Mounted Division formed part of Desert Column, Egyptian Expeditionary Force in World War I. The division was originally made up of the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, (formerly Anzac Mounted Division) the reconstituted 4th Light Horse Brigade, and two British yeomanry brigades; the 5th Mounted Brigade and 6th Mounted Brigade.

== History ==

===Formation===
The Imperial Mounted Division was formed in Egypt in 1917 by bringing together two Australian Light Horse brigades, two British Yeomanry brigades, and a British horse artillery brigade (four batteries). These units were:
* The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was formed in Australia in October 1914 with the 8th, 9th, and 10th Light Horse Regiments and was posted to Egypt in March 1915. It was dismounted and served in Gallipoli from May to December attached to the New Zealand and Australian Division (notably the Battle of Sari Bair). It joined the ANZAC Mounted Division when it was formed in March 1916 and saw action with it at the battles of Romani and Magdhaba. It joined the division on formation in January 1917; it was replaced in the ANZAC Mounted Division by the British 22nd Mounted Brigade.
* The 4th Light Horse Brigade was formed in Australia in February 1915 with the 11th, 12th, and 13th Light Horse Regiments and was posted to Egypt in July 1915. The brigade was broken up: the 11th Light Horse Regiment was dismounted and served in Gallipoli as reinforcements to other regiments; the 12th Light Horse Regiment was dismounted and attached to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade in Gallipoli (AugustDecember 1915) and 2nd Light Horse Brigade in Egypt (April 1915January 1917); and the 13th Light Horse Regiment remained mounted and joined the 2nd Australian Division. The brigade was reformed in January 1917with the 4th Light Horse Regiment in place of the 13th and joined the division on formation.
* The 5th Mounted Brigade was formed as part of the Territorial Force in 1908 as the 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade with three yeomanry regiments: the Warwickshire Yeomanry, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and the Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars. Shortly after the outbreak of war, it was assigned to the 2nd Mounted Division and moved to Egypt in April 1915. It was dismounted in August 1915 and took part in the Gallipoli Campaign as 1st Mounted Brigade, notably the Battle of Scimitar Hill. Due to losses and wastage during August 1915, it formed a battalion sized unit1st South Midland Regimentin 1st Composite Mounted Brigade. It returned to Egypt in December where it was reformed and remounted. The 2nd Mounted Division was broken up in January 1916 and it served as Corps Troops from 21 January 1916 (numbered as 5th Mounted Brigade from April). It joined the division on formation.
* The 6th Mounted Brigade was likewise formed as part of the Territorial Force in 1908 as the 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade with three yeomanry regiments: the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars, the Berkshire Yeomanry and the Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars. On 19 September 1914, the Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars was posted to the BEF, joining the 4th Cavalry Brigade in France. The Queen&#x27;s Own Dorset Yeomanry joined in the same month to replace them. The brigade&#x27;s early service was identical to the 5th Mounted Brigade until January 1916 when it joined the Western Frontier Force. It joined the division on formation.
* XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.) was formed for the division in January 1917 with four British Territorial Force horse artillery batteries: the 1/1st Berkshire and 1/1st Nottinghamshire Batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery, and 1/A and 1/B Batteries of the Honourable Artillery Company. All four batteries had originally gone out to Egypt with the 2nd Mounted Division in April 1915, but did not proceed to Gallipoli with the division. Instead, they variously served on the Suez Canal Defences, as part of the Western Frontier Force in the Senussi Campaign, or in Aden where 1/B Battery HAC and 1/1st Berkshire RHA fought a sharp action at Sheikh Othman that removed the Turkish threat to Aden for the rest of the war. They rejoined 2nd Mounted Division on its return from Gallipoli in December 1915, however, the dismemberment of the division began almost immediately as units were posted to the Western Frontier Force, Suez Canal Defences or to various other commands. Initially, each battery was equipped with four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns but were re-equipped with more modern 18 pounders (four per battery) in time for the First Battle of Gaza (2627 March 1917). In practice, the batteries were tactically attached to the mounted brigades, for example, 1/1st Nottinghamshire RHA to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and 1/A Battery HAC to the 4th Light Horse Brigade.
The division was also provided with support units, mostly assigned or attached directly to the brigades, but including an engineer squadron, a signals squadron, and train.

The division joined the Desert Column alongside the ANZAC Mounted Division.

During the First Battle of Gaza, the division (as the &quot;Imperial Mounted Division&quot;) provided protection from counter-attack on the eastern flank while the main infantry assault was underway. The brigades became the rearguard during the withdrawal from Gaza after the attack was called off.
