<text>The  (; ; abbr. CNAM) is an AMBA-accredited French &quot;grande école&quot; and &quot;grand établissement&quot;. It is a member of the &quot;Conférence des Grandes écoles&quot;, which is an equivalent to the Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the United Kingdom, the C9 League in China, or the Imperial Universities in Japan. CNAM is one of the founding Schools of the Grande école system, with &quot;École polytechnique&quot; and &quot;Ecole Normale Supérieure&quot; in 1794, in the wake of the French Revolution. 

Headquartered in Paris, it has campuses in every major French cities, in overseas France and in every francophone African country, China, Haiti, Germany, and Switzerland. Founded in 1794 by the French bishop Henri Grégoire, CNAM&#x27;s core mission is dedicated to provide education and conduct research for the promotion of science and industry. With 70,000 students and a budget of €174 million, it is the largest university in Europe in terms of Budget for distance learning and continued education, and in terms of enrolment, slightly ahead of the University of Hagen. 

Under the aegis of the French Ministry of National Education, the National Directory of Professional Certifications and the Accreditation authority for French professional engineers, CNAM provides Grande Ecole and non-Grande Ecole certificates, diplomas, Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Master&#x27;s degrees and PhD&#x27;s in Science, Engineering, Law, Management (AMBA-accredited), Finance, Accountancy, Urban planning and Humanities, all designed to abide by the European Bologna Process, and thus complying with the European Credit Transfer System. It is the only higher education institution in Europe to provide Physics, Chemistry and Life-Science engineer&#x27;s degrees up to a PhD-level (some of which 100% remotely) via distance learning and via its so-called &quot;hybrid learning&quot; which includes intermittent laboratories classes concentrated during a whole week on-site. 

The CNAM hosts also a museum dedicated to scientific and industrial inventions: Musée des Arts et Métiers (English: the Industrial Design Museum) which welcomed 250,000 visitors in 2018, and is located on the Parisian campus of the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts at 292 rue Saint Martin, in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris, in the historical area of the city named Le Marais.

== History ==
Founded on 10 October 1794, during the French Revolution, it was then proposed by Abbé Henri Grégoire as a &quot;depository for machines, models, tools, drawings, descriptions and books in all the areas of the arts and trades&quot;. The deserted Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory (and particularly its Gothic refectory by Pierre de Montereau) was selected as the site of collection, which officially opened in 1802.

Originally charged with the collection of inventions, it has since become an educational institution. At the present time, it is known primarily as a grand-école and university for:
* adults seeking higher education as engineering (multidisciplinary scientific program), master and bachelor degrees, mostly through evening and/or remote classes in a variety of topics ;
* young students enrolling in training diplomas in apprenticeship ;
* international student of bachelors and masters taught in English.

The collection of inventions is now operated by the Musée des Arts et Métiers. The original Foucault pendulum was exhibited as part of the collection, but was moved to the Panthéon in 1995 during museum renovation. It was later reinstalled in the Musée des Arts et Métiers. On 6 April 2010, the cable suspending the original pendulum bob snapped causing irreparable damage to the pendulum and to the marble flooring of the museum.

The novel &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; written by Umberto Eco deals greatly with this establishment, as the Foucault pendulum hung in the museum plays a great role in the storyline. The novel was published in 1988 prior to the pendulum being moved back to the Panthéon during the museum reconstruction.

On 25 November 1819, at the instigation of Duke Decazes, newly nominated as Minister of the Interior, a three-Chairs higher education is established at the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts: Applied Mechanical Engineering vested in Baron Charles Dupin; Applied Chemistry entrusted to Nicolas Clément; and Industrial Economics left with Jean Baptiste Say.

== Missions and Values ==
The French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts is infused with the values of the Lumières, as part of the French enlightenment era, of the 18th Century French Humanism, and of the French encyclopedists, whose goal was to provide emancipation via knowledge for everyone; the latter being often followed by most Grande Ecole and Universities in France, along with Universalism and Cartesianism. This background paved the way to nowadays CNAM&#x27;s values of meritocracy, solidarity and academic excellence.

Under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and as French public institution of higher education, it is assigned three missions:

* Training throughout life (Lifelong learning);
* Technological research and innovation;
* Dissemination of scientific and technical culture.

These missions and values are reflected in CNAM&#x27;s motto: &quot;Omnes docet ubique&quot;, which means: &quot;Teaching to everyone everywhere.&quot;

== Campuses ==

=== Parisian campus ===
Out of the 70,000 students enrolled at CNAM (57.7% employees, 24% job seekers, 12% students, 6.3% self-employed), 36% are enrolled at the Parisian campus, 3% in Overseas France, 11% abroad and the rest in metropolitan France, of which 1,592 are enrolled at the Grande Ecole engineer school of CNAM: the EiCNAM. The Parisian campus and headquarters of the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts is located in one of the last medieval architectural area of Paris, in the historical district of Le Marais in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris, at the former Benedictine priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs, which church and core architectural style was inspired by the Basilica of Saint-Denis architecture built a few years earlier.

This large Cluniac monastery founded by King Henry the First of France in 1059–1060 on Merovingian vestige, is still visible today. The former gothic-style refectory hall dated from the 13th century remains until today and was reassigned as the library in the middle of the 19th century by the CNAM&#x27;s architect: Léon Vaudoyer. 

=== Campuses in the rest of Metropolitan France ===
CNAM is based in 160 other French cities. French regional CNAM Centres are financially independent but pedagogically linked to the CNAM public institution based in Paris (namely of enrolment, selection and evaluation of candidates), and their existence is governed by a specific ministry decree. Half of the regional CNAM centres budget is allocated by the French regional councils. A student should apply through the nearest French regional CNAM in terms of enrolment, in other words, someone living in Marseille should enrol in Marseille&#x27;s regional center (PACA) and not in Paris, even if his/her desired curriculum is not available in Marseille. As the vast majority of continuing education curricula are taught online, continuing education students can most of the time attend them via their nearest CNAM regional centre. Shall some specific classes be available only in Paris or at another regionalc centre, the student can attend these courses on-site, shall it be required (for example laboratory sessions in Life Science, Physics or Chemistry). Regional centres providing Engineering diploma via the EiCNAM, the Grande Ecole Engineer School of CNAM are all certified by the French national committee responsible for evaluation and accreditation of higher education institutions for the training of professional engineers in France (in French: , abbr.: CTI). Some CNAM regional centres are hosted by other partner universities, for example the CNAM centre of Aix-en-Provence is located at the campus of the French Grande Ecole engineering and research school: Arts et Métiers ParisTech.

=== Grande école academic features ===

The French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts is a Grand Etablissment (like the prestigious Collège de France founded in 1530), but is also a Grande Ecole which provides Grande-Ecole degrees, i.e. solely Master&#x27;s Degrees, MBAs and PhDs (Grande Ecoles do not bestow diplomas lower than a European Master&#x27;s degree level). A Grande Ecole, literally &quot;Great School&quot;, is a higher education institution and part of a French league of universities, which select students via national competitive entrance examinations (in French: &quot;concours&quot;) to safeguard meritocracy and impartiality. The French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts was one of the founding Schools of the Grande Ecole System in the wake of the French Revolution. 

Grande Ecoles are separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. &quot;Grandes écoles&quot;, like CNAM, are elite academic institutions which enroll students via an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France. The degrees are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and bestowed upon by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business and engineering degrees in France are organised into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the &quot;Licence&quot; / Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and the Master&#x27;s and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelor&#x27;s and the Master&#x27;s degrees are organised in semesters: 6 for the Bachelor&#x27;s and 4 for the Master&#x27;s. Those levels of study include various &quot;parcours&quot; (in English: paths or curricula) based on UE (&quot;Unités d&#x27;enseignement&quot; or &quot;Modules&quot;, in English: Teaching Units or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS) and thus abiding by the Bologna Process of the European Union. A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between curricula. A Bachelor&#x27;s is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (3 years of higher studies after high school, abbreviated in French as &quot;bac+ 3&quot;); a Master&#x27;s is awarded once 120 additional credits have been reached (5 years of higher studies after high school, abbreviated in French as &quot;bac+ 5&quot;, i.e. 2 additional years after a Bachelor&#x27;s degree).

==== National competitive examinations as prerequesite of French Grande Ecoles ====
One of the prerequesite of a Grande Ecole (along with having the Grande Ecole-label), is to select students via national competitive examinations. The latter are well-acknowledged to be particularly stringent. While students prepare for these National Competitive examinations right after their high school diploma (often obtained with a magna cum laude or summa cum laude) during a two-year preparatory programme in high schools proposing such curricula; some other students will start an Undergraduate or Bachelor&#x27;s degree and prepare for the national Competitive examinations along their studies at Universities or private Colleges in France or abroad. Both pathways have their own advantages and drawbacks.

As CNAM provides remote and continuous education, the access to the Grande Ecole does not require that candidates go through preparatory classes. Instead, obligatory classes and tests in Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and English, along with a minimum required work experience (at least 6 months in a relevant field to the one the candidate wishes to apply to) and a minimum degree in a relevant field (an Undergraduate degree, i.e. 2 years of higher education after the French High School Diploma called &quot;Baccalauréat&quot;) will be expected as minimum requirements from candidates. Additionally, an interview of candidates will be conducted to select appropriate future Grande Ecole students. The Competitive Examination can only be retaken thrice. 

The most selective Grande Ecole will enroll less than 10% of candidates, i.e. 90% of candidates are bound to fail, not because they performed poorly, but because a handful of students performed better, which is in itself, the principle of a competitive examination. In some Grande Ecole, it is possible to retake a Grande Ecole national competitive examination as many times as one wishes, whereas some others limit the possibilities to retake the examination to a maximum of three times.

<text>Studio City is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, United States, in the southeast San Fernando Valley, just west of the Cahuenga Pass. It is named after the studio lot that was established in the area by film producer Mack Sennett in 1927, now known as Radford Studio Center.

==History==
Originally known as Laurelwood, the area that Studio City occupies was formerly part of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando was a Mexican land grant in present-day Los Angeles County, California, granted in 1846 by Governor Pío Pico to Eulogio F. de Celis. This land changed hands several times during the late 19th century, and eventually passed into the ownership of James Boon Lankershim (1850–1931) and eight other developers, who organized the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company. In 1899, the area lost most water rights to Los Angeles, so subdivision and sale of land for farming became untenable.

Construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct began in 1908, and water reached the San Fernando Valley in November 1913. Real estate boomed, and a syndicate led by Harry Chandler, business manager of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, with Hobart Johnstone Whitley, Isaac Van Nuys, and James Boon Lankershim acquired the remaining of the southern half of the former Mission lands—everything west of the Lankershim town limits and south of present-day Roscoe Boulevard excepting the Rancho Encino. Whitley platted the area of present-day Studio City from portions of the existing town of Lankershim, as well as the eastern part of the new acquisition.

In 1927, Mack Sennett began building a new studio on donated by the land developer. The area around the studio was named Studio City.

In 1955, Studio City&#x27;s Station 78 became the first racially integrated station in the Los Angeles City Fire Department.

A house fire that soon spread to surrounding homes broke out in Studio City on January 8, 2025 as part of the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Geography==
The Los Angeles River and Tujunga Wash flow through Studio City. The two concrete-lined channels merge just west of Colfax Avenue and north of Ventura Boulevard adjacent to Radford Studio Center.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 34,034 residents in the Studio City neighborhood—5,395 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for the city but about average for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 37,201.

In 2000, the median age for residents, 38, was considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percent of residents age 19 and older was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The ethnic breakdown was Whites, 78%; Latinos, 8.7%; Asians, 5.4%; Blacks, 3.7%; and others, 4.1%. Iran (7%) and the United Kingdom (6.7%) were the most common places of birth for the 21.1% of the residents who were born abroad—a low percentage for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $75,657, considered high for the city. The percent of households earning $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 1.9 people was low when compared to the rest of the city and the county. Renters occupied 55.9% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 44.1%.

In 2000, there were 837 families headed by single parents, the rate of 11.2% being low for the city of Los Angeles. There were 2,591 veterans, 8.8% of the population, a high figure for the city.

<doc id="434499" wikidata="Q762108" url="?curid=434499" title="Tió de Nadal">
<text>The Tió de Nadal (; &#x27;Christmas Log&#x27;), also known simply as tió (&#x27;log&#x27;), soca or tronc(a) (&#x27;trunk&#x27;), is a character in Catalan mythology relating to a Christmas tradition widespread in Catalonia, Majorca (known as Nadaler), Aragon, Occitania (Southern France) and Andorra. In Aragon it is also called, in Aragonese, Tizón de Nadal, Toza de Nadal or Tronca de Nadal.

The Tió de Nadal is related to the tradition of the Germanic Christmas tree, also a bearer of gifts for the little ones, and with the British Yule log (tizón do Nadal in Galicia and Cachafuòc, Cachofio or Soc de Nadal in Occitania).

==Overview==
The form of the &quot;Tió de Nadal&quot; found in many Catalan homes during the holiday season is a hollow log about long. Recently, the &quot;Tió&quot; has come to stand up on two or four stick legs with a broad smiling face painted on its higher end, enhanced by a red sock hat (a miniature of the traditional barretina) and often a three-dimensional nose. Those accessories have been added only in recent times, altering the more traditional and rough natural appearance of a piece of wood.

Beginning with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8), one gives the &quot;tió&quot; a little bit to &quot;eat&quot; every night and usually covers him with a blanket so that he will not be cold. The story goes that in the days preceding Christmas, children must take good care of the log, keeping it warm and feeding it, so that it will defecate presents on Christmas Day or Eve.

On Christmas Day or, in some households, on Christmas Eve, one puts the &quot;tió&quot; partly into the fireplace and orders it to defecate. The fire part of this tradition is no longer as widespread as it once was, since many modern homes do not have a fireplace. To make it defecate, one beats the &quot;tió&quot; with sticks, while singing various songs of &quot;Tió de Nadal&quot;.

The tradition says that before beating the &quot;tió&quot; all of the children must leave the room and go to another place of the house to pray, asking for the &quot;tió&quot; to deliver a lot of presents. Nowadays, the praying tradition has been left behind. Still, children go to a different room, usually the kitchen, to warm their stick next to a fire.

The &quot;tió&quot; does not drop larger objects, as those are considered to be brought by the Three Wise Men. It does leave candies, nuts, &quot;torrons&quot;, and small toys. Depending on the region of Catalonia, it may also give out dried figs. What comes out of the &quot;Tió&quot; is a communal rather than individual gift, shared by everyone there.

The &quot;tió&quot; is often popularly called &quot;Caga tió&quot; (&quot;shitting log&quot;, &quot;poo log&quot;). This derives from the many songs of &quot;Tió de Nadal&quot; that begin with this phrase, which was originally (in the context of the songs) an imperative (&quot;Shit, log!&quot;). The use of this expression as a name is not believed to be part of the ancient tradition and its use is discouraged.

== &quot;Caga tió&quot; song ==

A song is sung during this celebration. After hitting the &quot;tió&quot; softly with a stick during the song, it is hit harder on the words &quot;Caga tió!&quot; Then somebody puts their hand under the blanket and takes a gift. The gift is opened and then the song begins again. There are many &quot;Caga tió&quot; songs connected to the holiday and the log. The following variant is one of the more popular versions of this song:

<text>The Musée des Arts et Métiers (; English: Museum of Arts and Crafts) is an industrial design museum in Paris that houses the collection of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, which was founded in 1794 as a repository for the preservation of scientific instruments and inventions.
==History==
Since its foundation, the museum has been housed in the deserted priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs on the in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris. Today the museum, which underwent major renovations in 1990, includes an additional building adjacent to the abbey, with larger objects remaining in the abbey itself.

==Collection==
The museum has over 80,000 objects and 15,000 drawings in its collection, of which about 2,500 are on display in Paris. The rest of the collection is preserved in a storehouse in Saint-Denis. Among its collection is an original version of the Foucault pendulum, the original model of &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot; (commonly known as the Statue of Liberty) by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, some of the first planes (Clément Ader&#x27;s Avion III, Louis Blériot&#x27;s Blériot XI...), and Blaise Pascal&#x27;s Pascaline (the first mechanical calculator).

The museum presents seven different collections : Scientific Instruments, Materials, Energy, Mechanics, Construction, Communication, Transportation. In the former church of St-Martin-des-Champs Priory are displayed cars, planes, the Foucault Pendulum and some other monumental objects.

The first portable steam engine and self propelled vehicle (automobile) Nicolas Cugnot&#x27;s 1770 Fardier has been in this collection for over 200 years.

==Cultural references==
The museum appears in literature as the scene of the climax of the 1988 novel &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; by Umberto Eco, and is featured in the 2019 documentary film about the Statue of Liberty, &quot;Liberty: Mother of Exiles&quot;.

==Transportation==
The museum can be accessed by the Paris Métro station Arts et Métiers. (The museum&#x27;s entrance is at the corner of Rue Réaumur and Rue Vaucanson.)

<text>Tarzana () is a suburban neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Tarzana is on the site of a former ranch owned by author Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is named after Burroughs&#x27; fictional jungle hero, Tarzan.
==History==
The area now known as Tarzana was occupied in 1797 by settlers and missionaries from New Spain who established the San Fernando Mission. The region was later absorbed by Mexico, and then surrendered to the United States in 1848 in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican–American War. As part of the U.S., it evolved into a series of large cattle ranches. Investors in the region turned grazing fields into large-scale wheat farms during the 1870s.

The area was purchased in 1909 by the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; founder and publisher General Harrison Gray Otis invested in the company and also personally acquired in the center of modern-day Tarzana.

In February 1919, Edgar Rice Burroughs, author of the popular &quot;Tarzan&quot; novels, relocated to California from Oak Park, Illinois. He and his family had wintered in Southern California twice before, and he found the climate ideal. On March 1, 1919, Burroughs purchased Otis&#x27;s tract and established Tarzana Ranch. Burroughs subdivided and sold the land for residential development, some parcels of which were utilized as small farms.

<text>Sherman Oaks (founded in 1927) is a neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles, California within the San Fernando Valley region. The neighborhood includes a portion of the Santa Monica Mountains, which gives Sherman Oaks a lower population density than some other areas in Los Angeles.

==History==

A partner of the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, Gen. Moses Hazeltine Sherman developed Sherman Oaks. The company had subdivided of land that would become Sherman Oaks. In 1927, each acre was sold for $780. Sherman&#x27;s other major venture was the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad.

In 1991, a group of homeowners living in the Chandler Estates area successfully petitioned former Los Angeles City Councilmember Zev Yaroslavsky to re-draw the boundaries of Sherman Oaks from Magnolia Boulevard to Burbank Boulevard in the north, and from Coldwater Canyon Avenue to Van Nuys Blvd in the west, with the goal of including their neighborhood. This request was nothing new to the San Fernando Valley; other neighborhoods had either sought to change their names, or sought to attach themselves onto more affluent neighborhoods. Residents in the area argued, however, that the area was originally part of Sherman Oaks, but was labeled Van Nuys instead through the creation of ZIP codes in 1962; a resident produced a property deed to buttress the case.

Just a few weeks after the Chandler Estates area successfully seceded from Van Nuys, Magnolia Woods, a 45 block area bordered by Van Nuys Boulevard on the east and the San Diego Freeway on the west, and between Burbank and Magnolia Boulevards, also successfully petitioned Los Angeles City council member Marvin Braude to secede from Van Nuys and join Sherman Oaks. Petitioners in the area argued that their neighborhood was also part of Sherman Oaks, though they were only able to produce 22 deeds showing so. As a result of this change, Van Nuys Middle School became separated from its namesake neighborhood.

Finally, in 2009, the Los Angeles City council voted to redraw neighborhood boundaries again to allow an area of about 1,800 homes in Van Nuys to be included.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused damage in the surrounding area. The Community Redevelopment Agency sought to manage the rebuilding efforts. The homeowners in the Sherman Oaks area later won a lawsuit to prevent the agency from managing efforts.

==Geography and climate==
The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Studio City to the east, Van Nuys to the north, Encino to the west, Bel Air and Beverly Hills Post Office to the south.

== Demographics ==

<doc id="434510" wikidata="Q2661305" url="?curid=434510" title="SBS Transit">
<text>SBS Transit Ltd (abbreviation: SBS or SBST) is a multi-modal public transport operator in Singapore operating bus and rail services. With a majority of its shares owned by Singaporean multinational transport conglomerate ComfortDelGro Corporation at 75%, it was formerly known as Singapore Bus Services before rebranding to SBS Transit on 1 November 2001.

It is the largest public bus operator in Singapore, as well as one of the two major operators of Singapore&#x27;s rail services along with SMRT Corporation. It has a fleet of 3,656 buses and operates 261 routes, as of 2015.
==History==
===Singapore Bus Services (19732001)===
Singapore Bus Services Limited was established on 1 July 1973 when the regional bus companies Amalgamated Bus Company, Associated Bus Services and United Bus Company (which were in turn results of amalgamations of privately run Chinese bus companies of the 1960s in 1971) agreed to merge their operations with each taking shareholdings of 53%, 19% and 28% respectively in the new company. The government-sanctioned merger was undertaken to improve service standards of the bus transport system. The company was replaced by the Singapore Bus Service (1978) Limited on 17 February 1978, which was then listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) on 26 June the same year.

In 1992, SBS were reorganised under a new subsidiary SBS Bus Services Pte Ltd. On 12 November 1997, Singapore Bus Services (1978) Limited was renamed DelGro Corporation, with SBS Bus Services Pte Ltd listed separately as Singapore Bus Services Limited on 10 December that year.

SBS also operated taxis as SBS Taxis. SBS Taxis merged with Singapore Commuter and Singapore Airport Bus Services on 1 July 1995 to form CityCab, which remained part of DelGro Corporation.

SBS also operated Airbus in the past from 1995 to 1997 and Premium Bus Services, Sentosa Services and Jurong Island Services called &quot;SBS Leisure&quot; in 1995 to 2003. SBS had transferred Sentosa and Jurong Island Services in 2003, and Premium Bus Services (555 and 556) in December 2003 to private bus operators. 555 was a bus service from Watten Estate to Spottiswoode Park and 556 was a bus service from Sunset Way to Shenton Way, but it was totally withdrawn on 31 October 2004.

=== Route Handovers ===
===SBS Transit (2001 - present)===
On 1 November 2001, Singapore Bus Services was rebranded as SBS Transit to reflect it becoming a multi-modal transport operator with the impending opening of the Sengkang LRT line and North East MRT line.

On 29 March 2003, DelGro Corporation merged with Comfort Group to form ComfortDelGro Corporation. ComfortDelGro Corporation owns 75% of the shares in SBS Transit.

On 18 January 2003, SBS Transit commenced operating the Sengkang LRT, followed by the North East MRT line on 20 June the same year. SBS Transit commenced operating the Punggol LRT on 29 January 2005, followed by the Downtown MRT line on 22 December 2013.

==Bus==
===Routes===
SBS Transit had operated the majority of routes in almost all towns of Singapore with the notable exception of Tuas, Joo Koon, Jurong West, Jurong East, Tengah, Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang, Woodlands, Sembawang, Yishun, Punggol and Pasir Ris, where most routes were under SMRT Buses, Tower Transit (Bulim Bus Package &amp; Sembawang-Yishun Bus Package) and Go-Ahead (Loyang Bus Package). As of 2025, there are 222 wheelchair-accessible bus services that SBS Transit operates.

SBS Transit later became the first local operator to win a tender under the BCM in April 2017, and began operating the Seletar Bus Package on 18 March 2018. It was announced in 2018 by LTA that SBS Transit had won the subsequent package, the Bukit Merah Bus Package.

In 2023, it was announced that SBS Transit retained the Bukit Merah Bus Package for its second term, but lost the bid for Jurong West Bus Package, which was awarded to SMRT Buses. In July 2024, it was announced that SBS Transit retained the Seletar Bus Package for its second term.

===Fleet===
As of December 2019, SBS Transit operated more than 3,500 buses.

When SBS was first formed in 1973, it inherited a wide variety of buses of various makes from its Chinese predecessors. Examples of such buses included the Albion Viking, Mercedes-Benz LP1113 and OF1413 and Nissan Diesel RX102K3 with small numbers of Ford R192 and 226, Seddon, Fargo-Kew, Bedford and Austin. Most of these buses were bodied by local coachbuilder Soon Chow although some were bodied by other companies such as Supreme Star and Strachan. Subsequent models that were purchased by SBS included Berliet and Guy Victory in the 1970s and the Volvo B57 and Mercedes-Benz OF1417 in the 1980s, the latter which were bodied by foreign coachbuilders like New Zealand Motor Bodies and Hawke Coachwork.

In 1976, SBS purchased its first 20 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses to evaluate the suitability of double-decker bus operation, with the buses first entering service on route 86 on 13 June 1977. Following the success of the trial, SBS ordered another 500 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses from 1978 to 1984, all of which were either bodied by Metal Sections or Walter Alexander Coachbuilders; SBS also conducted comparative trials of double-decker buses of other makes, namely the Leyland Olympian, Volvo Ailsa B55, Scania BR112DH, Dennis Dominator, Dennis Trident 3, Mercedes-Benz O305 and Volvo B10MD Citybus. In 1984, SBS purchased another 200 Leyland Olympian and 200 Mercedes-Benz O305 double-decker buses. SBS also conducted an evaluation of air conditioned buses (namely the ex-Singapore Airport Bus Services Mercedes-Benz OF1413 coaches) that year and conducted similar trials with other bus models like the Nissan Diesel U31S and Renault PR100 (SBS30P) before its first bulk order for 50 Scania N113CRB buses in 1989.

In the 1990s, some bus models on the roads included the Volvo B10M, Scania N113CRB, Mercedes-Benz O405, Leyland and Volvo Olympian and Dennis Dart. SBS also conducted trials of high capacity single decker buses, namely a superlong Volvo B10M Mark IV (SBS997A), an articulated Volvo B10MA (SBS998Y) and an articulated Mercedes-Benz O405G (SBS999U), in 1996 although the trial did not succeed. The first low-floor bus, a Volgren-bodied Volvo B10TL demonstrator (SBS9888Y) was brought to SBS by Volvo Buses for trial purposes in 1999. After its successful trial, 51 Volvo B10TL chassis were further brought in by SBS Transit. 50 buses are bodied by Volgren between 2002 and 2003 while 1 remaining chassis is being reserved for a ComfortDelGro Engineering bodywork, which entered revenue service by 2005. The first wheelchair-accessible bus was also brought into service in 2006. SBS Transit CNG buses began service in 2002. Hybrid and electric buses came into foray since 2019, although small-scale trials began in 2010.

In 2020 to 2021, a unit of Mercedes-Benz Citaro C2 Hybrid, SG4004B, was brought in for trial purposes and was loaned from Daimler South East Asia under a Special Purpose License. The bus was on revenue service from 9 March 2020 to 8 March 2021 on routes 93 &amp; 272 with SBS Transit based at the Ulu Pandan Depot.

All single-decker Volvo B10BLE CNG buses were retired in 2019 except for the first two units which had been preserved, after that, both Volvo B10TLs and Volvo B9TL CDGEs were retired early and scrapped. Only 20 Volvo B9TL CDGE buses remained in operation until late September 2023 when they reached the end of their lifespan, with the last day of service being 22 September.

In March 2024, several units of the Scania K230UB (Euro IV and V) buses were transferred to SMRT Buses from SBS Transit for some testings at Woodlands Depot before the Jurong West Bus Package begins operations in September that year.

==Rail==
===Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)===
SBS Transit operates two of Singapore&#x27;s six MRT lines in the network, the North East Line (NEL) since its opening on 20 June 2003 and the Downtown Line (DTL) since its opening on 22 December 2013.
SBS Transit is also set to operate the Jurong Region Line (JRL) as a joint venture alongside French rail operator RATP Dev under the operator name Singapore One Rail when it opens in 2027. 

The NEL currently spans 21.6 km and 17 stations, running from HarbourFront in the south-west to Punggol Coast in the north-east. As of 2023, the NEL uses a fleet composed of three very similar series of 49 Alstom Metropolis train-sets, namely the C751A, C751C and C851E. The operating license for the NEL was awarded to SBS Transit in order to foster competition with SMRT Trains and to create multi-modal public transport companies, each specialising in their own district. In 2018, it was confirmed that SBS Transit&#x27;s contract for maintaining the NEL would last until 31 March 2033.

The NEL was Singapore&#x27;s third metro line and the city&#x27;s first automated and driverless system. At times, it has been referred to as &quot;the first driverless heavy metro line in the world&quot; or the &quot;world&#x27;s first fully automated and driverless high-capacity rapid transit line&quot; by some. While driverless metro systems have existed long before (notably the Lille Metro since 1983, the Vancouver Skytrain since 1985 and the Kelana Jaya Line and Paris Metro Line 14 since 1998), the NEL is the first application of a fully automated and driverless metro system with heavy rail characteristics such as an overhead catenary (in contrast to earlier systems using third rail) and 1,435 mm standard-gauge (in contrast to earlier systems featuring smaller rail profiles). Till today, it is the only MRT line in Singapore using the overhead catenary electrical system while the rest of Singapore&#x27;s MRT uses the third rail.

The DTL currently spans 41.9 km and 35 stations as of 2025, running from Bukit Panjang station in the north-west to Expo station in the east via the Central Area. The DTL is fully automated and driverless as well and consists of a fleet of 92 Bombardier Movia C951 trainsets.

====Fleet====

*The trains are classified as contracts unlike other countries which use &quot;class&quot;.

===Light Rail Transit (LRT)===
Out of three LRT lines in Singapore, two are operated and maintained by SBS Transit, namely the Sengkang LRT line and Punggol LRT line (SPLRT). These lines serve a total of 29 stations and provide feeder connections to Sengkang and Punggol stations. As of 2025, these lines use a fleet of 57 sets comprising two series of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover APMs (namely the C810 and C810A), a number expected to increase in the future with the introduction of C810D APMs. In 2018, it was confirmed that SBS Transit&#x27;s contract for both LRT lines would run until 31 March 2033.

*The trains are classified as contracts unlike other countries which use &quot;class&quot;.

===Depots===
Out of ten operational rail depots in Singapore, SBS Transit maintains three, namely:
*Sengkang Depot which houses NEL and SPLRT trains. The depot is undergoing an expansion program which is targeted for completion in 2027 in order to accommodate more trains, after being in operation since 2003.
*Tai Seng Facility Building which houses some DTL trains.
*Gali Batu Depot which houses the majority of DTL trains. It has undergone expansion towards the end of 2010s.
*East Coast Integrated Depot which is expected to house DTL trains upon its opening in 2026.

<text>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is a statutory board under the Ministry of Transport of the Government of Singapore.

==History==
===Incorporation===
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) was established on 1 September 1995 and was formed by the merger of various public sector entities: the Registry of Vehicles, Mass Rapid Transit Corporation, Roads &amp; Transportation Division of the Public Works Department and Land Transportation Division of the former Ministry of Communications.

===1996 Land Transport White Paper===
On 2 January 1996, the Land Transport Authority published the 1996 Land Transport White Paper, titled &quot;A World Class Land Transport System&quot;. It outlined the government plans. Changes to existing schemes were proposed along with schemes were introduced across various transport sectors. This included the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme, which eventually become ubiquitous in the city state.

====1996 Rail Financing Framework====
The 1996 Rail Financing Framework was a scheme that set out the financing framework of the rail transport system. In the white paper, it was phrased that the financing framework of the rail transport system would eventually be run on the basis of partnership, which the government and its regulatory authority would provide the assets and infrastructure (which remain fully owned by the regulatory authority), with commuters paying for the operating costs and operators extracting efficiency dividends within standards and fares set by the regulatory authority.

The framework allowed for an open up of the rail transport market with the operation aspects of the industry no longer tied to the authorities, allowing for more autonomy of the incumbent operator and new operators to enter the market. This also laid the foundation for the restructure and flotation of SMRT Corporation, previously a state-owned incumbent operator under the name Mass Rapid Transit Corporation, in 2000.

The framework was revised in 2008 as the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), which saw the regulatory authority re-assuming the full ownership of all rail assets, where the ownership and maintenance of which were previously held responsible under the individual operators.

==Changes to public transport==
To meet with the increasing number of commuters in Singapore, Land Transport Authority exercises on new changes over time.

===Rail===
LTA is responsible for the development of the rapid transit system and the expansion of the rail network. It aims to double the rail network by 2030. Since 2008, LTA has increased the length of Singapore&#x27;s rail network from 138 km to about 180 km with the opening of the Boon Lay Extension in 2009, the Circle Line from 2009 to 2011 and the Circle Line Extension in 2012. Downtown Line, Thomson–East Coast Line are underway towards completion, with Cross Island Line and Jurong Region Line under construction.

Half-height platform screen doors were installed in all 36 elevated stations in 2012 for the safety of passengers and to reduce delays in train service from track intrusions. HVLS fans are also installed at all elevated stations starting from 1 June 2012 and ending on 6 January 2013.

===Bus===
LTA took on the role of central bus network planner from 2009, working with communities and the bus operators, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses, to identify areas for bus improvements and to shift the focus to placing the commuter at the centre and taking a holistic approach in planning the bus network, taking into consideration development in the Rapid Transit System (RTS) network and other transport infrastructure. It is meant for their feedbacks, and any changes will be under the monthly updates, this has been brought through Bus Services Enhancement Programme. Under BSEP, about 80 new services are being introduced and 1,000 buses are being added over five years.

Quality of Service (QoS) standards have also been tightened to reduce waiting time and reduce crowding. Now, those with increased loads run every 10 minutes or less during weekday peak hours in 2015. Feeder bus services have become more frequent too, with 95% of bus services now running at intervals of 10 minutes or less during the weekday peak periods, tightened from 85%.

Announced in 2014, the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) which took effect on 1 September 2016, saw LTA assuming the full ownership of all bus assets in Singapore.

===Road projects===
Investment in road projects ensures that the economy will be ably supported with a strong and ever-improving transport infrastructure and coordinated system. One such project is the introduction of the Parking Guidance System (PGS) in the city and HarbourFront area to guide drivers to the nearest parking facility with available parking spaces, reducing the need for vehicles to cruise around to find empty parking spaces.

As part of investment in road projects, LTA will also be expanding the EMAS signages and upgrading the oldest EMAS signages in the expressways.

To improve road safety, LTA implemented a variety of road engineering measures, such as adding pedestrian crossing lines with enhanced dash markings, traffic calming markings and &quot;pedestrian crossing ahead&quot; road markings in more locations in 2009. &quot;Your Speed Signs&quot;, electronic signs displaying the speed of a passing vehicle, were also introduced so that motorists could be more aware of their speeds and would be more likely to keep to the speed limit. Road studs which flash in tandem with the green man signal at traffic junctions were also installed at more locations to alert motorists to stop for crossing pedestrians.

LTA is not responsible for reminding vehicle owners to scan their Autopass card when exiting Singapore.

<text>Goopy Geer is an animated cartoon character created in 1932 for the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons from Warner Bros. He is a singing, dancing, piano-playing dog who is considered to be &quot;the first &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; star&quot;, although he only starred in three cartoons.

==History==
The character is a tall, lanky anthropomorphic dog with scruffy whiskers and long, expressive ears. He was &quot;a wisecracking entertainer -- &#x27;part comedian, part musician and part dancer&#x27; -- inspired by vaudeville showmen of [the 1930s].&quot;

Goopy&#x27;s character was based on a familiar archetype of entertainment, as Hank Sartin says in &quot;Reading the Rabbit:

In all of his animated appearances, Goopy is depicted as light colored, but in an early promotional drawing for his first cartoon, he had black fur.

Goopy Geer was the last attempt by animator Rudolf Ising to feature a recurring character in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of films. Like most other early sound-era cartoon characters, Ising&#x27;s Goopy has little personality of his own. Instead, he sings and dances his way through a musical world in perfect syncopation. Ising only featured the character in three cartoons.

In the first, &quot;Goopy Geer&quot; (April 16, 1932), he plays a popular pianist entertaining at a nightclub. In Ising&#x27;s other two Goopy films, both in 1932, he cast the dog first as a hillbilly in &quot;Moonlight for Two&quot; (June 11, 1932), then as a court jester in &quot;The Queen Was in the Parlor&quot; (July 9, 1932). All of these cartoons also feature Goopy&#x27;s unnamed girlfriend who debuted without her gangly consort in the earlier &quot;Merrie Melodie&quot; &quot;Freddy the Freshman&quot; (February 20, 1932).

A month after Goopy Geer&#x27;s first cartoon had been released, Walt Disney released a cartoon called &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot; with a character named Dippy Dawg, whose overall appearance was very similar to that of Goopy Geer; due to the close proximity of the two cartoons&#x27; releases, there is little chance that either character was intended to be a copy of the other. Dippy Dawg would eventually be renamed to &quot;Goofy&quot;.

Goopy made a cameo in the Bosko cartoon &quot;Bosko in Dutch&quot; (January 14, 1933), but after Ising left Warner Bros. that same year, Goopy and other recurring &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; characters were retired, to be later replaced by such recurring characters as Sniffles the Mouse, Inki and the Mynah Bird, the Curious Puppies, and, on two occasions, Porky Pig (a character who was more prevalent in the black and white Looney Tunes).

==Later appearances==
Goopy Geer had a small role in the 1990s animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Two-Tone Town&quot; voiced by Robert Morse. Goopy, reprising his role as the happy-go-lucky pianist from his first cartoon, meets the series&#x27; stars when they visit the &quot;black-and-white&quot; part of town. His appearance in this cartoon is updated somewhat and seems to be based on early promotional drawings where his fur is black rather than his actual cartoon appearances.

<text>The Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis niger ), also known as the Pinta giant tortoise, Abingdon Island tortoise, or Abingdon Island giant tortoise, is a recently extinct subspecies of Galápagos tortoise native to Ecuador&#x27;s Pinta Island.

The subspecies was described by Albert Günther in 1877 after specimens arrived in London. By the end of the 19th century, most of the Pinta Island tortoises had been wiped out due to hunting. By the mid-20th century, the subspecies was assumed to be extinct until a single male was discovered on the island in 1971. Efforts were made to mate the male, named Lonesome George, with other subspecies, but no viable eggs resulted. Lonesome George died on 24 June 2012, and the subspecies was believed to have become extinct with his death. However, 17 first-generation hybrids were reported in 2012 from Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island during a trip by Yale University researchers. As these specimens were juveniles, their parents might still be alive. The subspecies is classified as extinct on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==
Lonesome George, along with other of the tortoises on Pinta Island, belonged to a species of 15 subspecies. Giant tortoises were once found on all of the continents except Australia and Antarctica. The Galápagos tortoises remain the largest living tortoises.

The Pinta Island tortoise was originally described in 1877 by German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther, who named it &quot;Testudo abingdonii&quot; in his book &quot;The Gigantic Land-tortoises (Living and Extinct) in the Collection of the British Museum&quot;. The name &quot;abingdonii&quot; derives from Abingdon Island, now more commonly known as Pinta Island. The knowledge of its existence was derived from short statements of the voyages of Captain James Colnett in 1798 and Basil Hall in 1822. In 1876, Commander William Cookson brought three male specimens (along with other subspecies of Galápagos tortoise) to London aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Peterel&quot;.

Synonyms of &quot;Chelonoidis abingdonii&quot; include &quot;Testudo abingdonii&quot; Günther, 1877; &quot;Testudo elephantopus abingdonii&quot; Mertens &amp; Wermuth, 1955; &quot;Geochelone elephantopus abingdonii&quot; Pritchard, 1967; &quot;Geochelone nigra abingdonii&quot; Iverson, 1992; and &quot;Geochelone abingdonii&quot; Valverde, 2004.

===Evolution===
The origin and systematic relationships are still unresolved today; they captivated Charles Darwin himself. DNA sequencing results indicate that the three best candidates for the closest living relative of the Galápagos tortoises all come from South America. They are the yellow-footed tortoise (&quot;Geochelone denticulata&quot;), the red-footed tortoise (&quot;Geochelone carbonaria&quot;), and the Chaco tortoise (&quot;Geochelone chilensis&quot;).

==Behaviour and ecology==
In the wild, Galápagos tortoises, including the Pinta Island subspecies, rested about 16 hours a day. Galápagos tortoises are herbivores, they fed primarily on greens, grasses, native fruit, and cactus pads. They drank large quantities of water, which they could store in their bodies for long periods of time for later use. They can reportedly survive up to six months without food or water.

For breeding, the tortoises were most active during the hot season (January to May). During the cool season (June to November), female tortoises migrated to nesting zones to lay their eggs.

Galápagos giant tortoises represent the top herbivores in the Galápagos, and as such they shape the entire island ecosystem. They provide critical ecosystem services by dispersing seeds and by acting as ecological engineers through herbivory and nutrient cycling. The extinction of the Pinta Island tortoise has diminished the functioning of the island ecosystem.

==Relationship with humans==
===Threats and conservation===
Several of the surviving subspecies of Galápagos tortoises are endangered. The decline of the population began in the 17th century as a result of visits by buccaneers and whalers. They hunted tortoises as a source of fresh meat, taking about 200,000 tortoises altogether.

In 1958, goats were brought to Pinta Island and began eating much of the vegetation, to the detriment of the natural habitat.
A prolonged effort to exterminate the goats was begun. As the goat populations declined, the vegetation recovered. Small trees began regenerating from the stumps left by the goats. Highland shrub subspecies, forest tree seedlings, &quot;Opuntia&quot; cactus, and other endemic subspecies increased. In 2003, Pinta Island was declared goat-free.

In addition to conservation efforts such as the elimination of goat populations in the Galápagos, there has been an effort to revive a number of subspecies of Galápagos tortoise through captive breeding. Future efforts may aim to recreate a population genetically similar to the original Pinta Island tortoise by breeding the first-generation hybrids discovered on Wolf Volcano.

===Lonesome George===
The last known individual of the subspecies was a male named Lonesome George (), who died on 24 June 2012. In his last years, he was known as the rarest creature in the world. George served as a potent symbol for conservation efforts in the Galápagos and internationally.

George was first seen on the island of Pinta on 1 December 1971 by Hungarian malacologist József Vágvölgyi. Relocated for his safety to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, George was penned with two females of different subspecies. Although the females laid eggs, none hatched. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced functionally extinct.

Over the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George were unsuccessful, possibly because his subspecies was not cross-fertile with the other subspecies.

On 24 June 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Director of the Galápagos National Park Edwin Naula announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by his caretaker of 40 years, Fausto Llerena. Naula suspects that the cause of death was heart failure consistent with the end of the natural life of a tortoise.

Giant tortoises are among the longest-lived vertebrate animals (more than 100 years by some estimates) and have been used as a model for providing insight into longevity. DNA analysis of the genomes of Lonesome George and the Aldabra giant tortoise &quot;Aldabrachelys gigantea&quot; led to the detection of lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes that might contribute to our understanding of increased lifespan.

===Possible remaining individuals===
In 2006, Peter Pritchard, one of the world&#x27;s foremost authorities on Galápagos tortoises, suggested that a male tortoise residing in the Prague Zoo might be a Pinta Island tortoise due to his shell structure. Subsequent DNA analysis, however, revealed that it was more likely to be from Pinzón Island, home of the Chelonoidis Niger Duncanensis subspecies.

Whalers and pirates in the past used Isabela Island, the central and largest of the Galápagos Islands, as a tortoise dumping ground. Today, the remaining tortoises that live around Wolf Volcano have combined genetic markers from several subspecies.

In May 2007, analysis of genomic microsatellites (DNA sequences) suggested that individuals from a translocated group of &quot;C. abingdonii&quot; may still exist in the wild on Isabela. Researchers identified one male tortoise from the Wolf Volcano region that had half its genes in common with George&#x27;s subspecies. This animal is believed to be a first-generation hybrid between the subspecies of the islands Isabela and Pinta. This suggests the possibility of a pure Pinta tortoise among the 2,000 tortoises on Isabela.

A subsequent trip to Isabela by Yale University researchers found 17 first-generation hybrids living at Wolf Volcano. The researchers planned to return to Isabela in the spring of 2013 to look for surviving Pinta tortoises and to try to collect hybrids in an effort to start a captive selective-breeding program and to hopefully reintroduce Pintas back to their native island.

In 2020, the Galápagos national park and Galápagos Conservancy announced that they had discovered one young female with a direct line of descent from the Chelonoidis abingdonii subspecies of Pinta island.

<doc id="434528" wikidata="Q1341655" url="?curid=434528" title="1920 Nebi Musa riots">
<text>The 1920 Nebi Musa riots or 1920 Jerusalem riots took place in British-controlled part of Occupied Enemy Territory Administration between Sunday, 4 April, and Wednesday, 7 April 1920 in and around the Old City of Jerusalem. Five Jews were killed and several hundred injured; four Arabs were killed, and eighteen injured; seven Britons were injured. The riots coincided with and are named after the Nebi Musa festival, which was held every year on Easter Sunday, and followed rising tensions in Arab–Jewish relations. The events came shortly after the Battle of Tel Hai and the increasing pressure on Arab nationalists in Syria in the course of the Franco-Syrian War.

Speeches were given by Arab religious leaders during the festival (in which large numbers of Muslims traditionally gathered for a religious procession), which included slogans referencing Zionist immigration and previous confrontations around outlying Jewish villages in the Galilee. The trigger which turned the procession into a riot is not known with certainty.

The British military administration of Palestine was criticized for withdrawing troops from inside Jerusalem and because it was slow to regain control. As a result of the riots, trust among the British, Jews, and Arabs eroded. One consequence was that the region&#x27;s Jewish community increased moves towards an autonomous infrastructure and security apparatus parallel to that of the British administration.

In its wake, sheikhs of 82 villages around the city and Jaffa, claiming to represent 70% of the population, issued a document protesting the demonstrations against the Jews. This condemnation may have been procured with bribes. Notwithstanding the riots, the Jewish community held elections for the Assembly of Representatives on 19 April 1920 among Jews everywhere in Palestine except Jerusalem, where they were delayed to 3 May. The riots also preceded the San Remo conference which was held from 19 to 26 April 1920 at which the fate of the Middle East was to be decided.

==Background==
The contents and proposals of both the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and Paris Peace Conference, 1919, which later concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, were the subject of intensive discussion by both Zionist and Arab delegations, and the process of the negotiations was widely reported in both communities. In particular, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led to an undertaking by the victorious powers, predominantly Great Britain and France, to assume a &#x27;holy mission of civilization&#x27; in the power vacuum of the Middle East. Under the Balfour Declaration, a homeland for the Jewish people was to be created in Palestine. The principle of self-determination affirmed by the League of Nations was not to be applied to Palestine, given the foreseeable rejection by the people of Zionism, which the British sponsored. These post-World War I arrangements both for Palestine and other Arab societies led to a radicalization of the Arab world.

On 1 March 1920, the death of Joseph Trumpeldor in the Battle of Tel Hai at the hands of a Shiite group from Southern Lebanon caused deep concern among Jewish leaders, who made numerous requests to the OETA administration to address the Yishuv&#x27;s security and forbid a pro-Syrian public rally. However, their fears were largely discounted by the Chief Administrative Officer General Louis Bols, Military Governor Ronald Storrs and General Edmund Allenby, despite a warning from the head of the Zionist Commission Chaim Weizmann that a &quot;pogrom is in the air&quot;, supported by assessments available to Storrs. Communiqués had been issued about foreseeable troubles among Arabs, and between Arabs and Jews. To Weizmann and the Jewish leadership, these developments were reminiscent of instructions that Russian generals had issued on the eve of pogroms. In the meantime, local Arab expectations had been raised to a pitch by the declaration of the Syrian Congress on 7 March of the independence of the region of Syria in the Kingdom of Syria, with Faisal as its king, that included the British-controlled territory within its claimed domain. On 7 and 8 March, demonstrations took place in all cities of Palestine, shops were closed and many Jews were attacked. Attackers carried slogans such as &quot;Death to Jews&quot; or &quot;Palestine is our land and the Jews are our dogs!&quot;

Jewish leaders requested that OETA authorise the arming of the Jewish defenders to make up for the lack of adequate British troops. Although this request was declined, Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, together with Pinhas Rutenberg, led an effort to openly train Jewish volunteers in self-defense, an effort of which the Zionist Commission kept the British informed. Many of the volunteers were members of the Maccabi sports club and some of them were veterans of the Jewish Legion. Their month of training largely consisted of calisthenics and hand to hand combat with sticks. By the end of March, about 600 were said to be performing military drills daily in Jerusalem. Jabotinsky and Rutenberg also began organizing the collection of arms.

The Nebi Musa festival was an annual spring Muslim festival that began on the Friday before Good Friday and included a procession to the Nebi Musa shrine (tomb of Moses) near Jericho. It had apparently existed since the time of Saladin. Arab educator and essayist Khalil al-Sakakini described how tribes and caravans would come with banners and weapons. The Ottoman Turks usually deployed thousands of soldiers and even artillery to keep order in the narrow streets of Jerusalem during the Nebi Musa procession. However, Storrs issued a warning to Arab leaders, but deployed only 188 policemen.

==4–7 April 1920, Old City==

By 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, 4 April 1920, 60,000–70,000 Arabs had congregated in the city square for the Nebi Musa festival, and groups had been attacking Jews in the Old City&#x27;s alleys for over an hour. A speech marked by anti-Zionist rhetoric was delivered by Amin al-Husayni from the balcony of the Arab Club. Musa al-Husayni, his uncle, the mayor, was also with him and spoke from the municipal building&#x27;s balcony in similar terms. According to testimony given by Fayyad al-Bakri to the Palin Commission, however, the rioting began when the Hebron banner he was holding while standing on Jaffa Street outside the Crédit Lyonnais Bank was spat on by a Jew and when the latter was pushed away, Jewish bystanders began throwing stones.

The editor of the newspaper &quot;Suriya al-Janubia&quot; (&quot;Southern Syria&quot;), Aref al-Aref, another Arab Club member, delivered a speech on horseback at the Jaffa Gate. The nature of his speech is disputed. According to Benny Morris, he said &quot;If we don&#x27;t use force against the Zionists and against the Jews, we will never be rid of them&quot;, while Bernard Wasserstein wrote &quot;he seems to have co-operated with the police, and there is no evidence that he actively instigated violence&quot;. In fact, Wasserstein adds, &quot;Zionist intelligence reports of this period are unanimous in stressing that he spoke repeatedly against violence&quot;.

The crowd reportedly shouted &quot;Independence! Independence!&quot; and &quot;Palestine is our land, the Jews are our dogs!&quot; Arab police joined in applause, and violence started. The local Arab population ransacked the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. The Torath Chaim Yeshiva was raided, and Torah scrolls were torn and thrown on the floor, and the building then set alight. During the next three hours, 160 Jews were injured.

Khalil al-Sakakini witnessed the eruption of violence in the Old City:
:&quot;[A] riot broke out, the people began to run about and stones were thrown at the Jews. The shops were closed and there were screams. … I saw a Zionist soldier covered in dust and blood. … Afterwards, I saw one Hebronite approach a Jewish shoeshine boy, who hid behind a sack in one of the wall&#x27;s comers next to Jaffa Gate, and take his box and beat him over the head. He screamed and began to run, his head bleeding and the Hebronite left him and returned to the procession. … The riot reached its zenith. All shouted, &quot;Muhammad&#x27;s religion was born with the sword&quot;. … I immediately walked to the municipal garden. … my soul is nauseated and depressed by the madness of humankind.&quot;

The army imposed night curfew on Sunday night and arrested several dozen rioters, but on Monday morning they were allowed to attend morning prayers and were then released. Arabs continued to attack Jews and break into their homes, especially in Arab-majority mixed buildings.

On Monday, as disturbances grew worse, the Old City was sealed off by the army and no one was allowed to exit the area. Martial law was declared, but looting, burglary, rape, and murder continued. Several homes were set on fire, and tombstones were shattered. British soldiers found that the majority of illicit weapons were concealed on the bodies of Arab women. On Monday evening, the soldiers were evacuated from the Old City, a step described in the Palin Report as &quot;an error of judgment&quot;. Even with martial law, it took the British authorities another 4 days to restore order.

The Old City&#x27;s Jewish community had no training or weapons, and Jabotinsky&#x27;s men had found themselves outside the walled Old City, and shut out by British soldiers. Two volunteers were able to enter the Jewish Quarter disguised as medical personnel to organize self-defense – using rocks and boiling water.

Five Jews and four Arabs died in the riots. Two-hundred and sixteen Jews were injured, 18 critically, and 23 Arabs, one critically. About 300 Jews were evacuated from the Old City.

==Accusations of British complicity==

In Hebrew the incidents were described as &quot;meoraot&quot;, connoting targeted attacks reminiscent of what had often occurred especially in Russia, whereas Palestinian Arabs referred to them as an heroic witness to an &#x27;Arab Revolt&#x27;. The use of the word pogrom to describe such outbreaks of communal violence bore with it the implication that the governing authorities, in this case the British administration, had actively connived in an anti-Jewish riot. The term drew an analogy between the classic form such actions took in Eastern Europe, where Jews were the victims of racist, anti-Semitic terror campaigns supported by the ruling authorities, with the situation in Palestine where Zionism was promoting a colonial adventure that was ethnically exclusive and challenged local Arab nationalist aspirations.
It was asserted soon after, by Chaim Weizmann and British army Lieutenant Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, that Haj Amin al-Husseini had been put up to inciting the riot by British Field-marshal Allenby&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Colonel Bertie Harry Waters-Taylor, to demonstrate to the world that Arabs would not tolerate a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The assertion was never proven, and Meinertzhagen was dismissed.

The Zionist Commission noted that before the riots Arab milkmen started to demand their customers in Meah Shearim pay them on the spot, explaining that they would no longer be serving the Jewish neighbourhood. Christian storekeepers had marked their shops in advance with the sign of the cross so that they would not be mistakenly looted. A previous commission report also accused Storrs of inciting the Arabs, blaming him for sabotaging attempts to purchase the Western Wall as well. A petition circulated among American citizens and presented to their consul protested that the British had prevented Jews from defending themselves.

After the violence broke out, Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky met Military Governor Storrs and suggested deployment of his volunteers, but his request was rejected. Storrs confiscated his pistol and demanded to know the location of his other weapons, threatening to arrest him for possessing a firearm. Later, Storrs changed his mind and asked for 200 volunteers to report to the police headquarters to be sworn in as deputies. After they arrived and the administering of the oath had begun, orders came to cease and he sent them away. Arab volunteers had also been invited, and were likewise sent away.

On Sunday night, the first day of the riots, several dozen rioters were arrested, but on Monday morning they were allowed to attend morning prayers and were then released. On Monday evening, after martial law was declared, the soldiers were evacuated from the Old City, a step described in the Palin Report as &quot;an error of judgment&quot;.

After the riots, Storrs visited Menachem Ussishkin, the new head of the Zionist Commission, to express &quot;regrets for the tragedy that has befallen us&quot;.

- Ussishkin asked, &quot;What tragedy?&quot;

- &quot;I mean the unfortunate events that have occurred here in the recent days&quot;, Storrs said.

- &quot;His excellency means the pogrom&quot;, suggested Ussishkin.

When Storrs hesitated to categorize the events as such, Ussishkin replied,

- &quot;You Colonel, are an expert on matters of management and I am an expert on the rules of pogroms.&quot;

The Palin Report noted that Jewish representatives persisted in describing the events as a &quot;pogrom&quot;, implying that the British administration had connived in the violence.

==Palin Commission of Inquiry==
The Palin Commission (or Palin Court of Inquiry), a committee of inquiry sent to the region in May 1920 by the British authorities, examined the reasons for this trouble. According to the Survey of Palestine:

Savage attacks were made by Arab rioters in Jerusalem on Jewish lives and property. Five Jews were killed and 211 injured. Order was restored by the intervention of British troops; four Arabs were killed and 21 injured. It was reported by a military commission of inquiry that the reasons for this trouble were:--

:(a) Arab disappointment at the non-fulfilment of the promises of independence which they claimed had been given to them during the war.
:(b) Arab belief that the Balfour Declaration implied a denial of the right of self-determination and their fear that the establishment of a National Home would mean a great increase in Jewish immigration and would lead to their economic and political subjection to the Jews.
:(c) The aggravation of these sentiments on the one hand by propaganda from outside Palestine associated with the proclamation of the Emir Feisal as King of a re-united Syria and with the growth of Pan-Arab and Pan-Moslem ideas, and on the other hand by the activities of the Zionist Commission supported by the resources and influence of Jews throughout the world.
The Palin Report on the April riots was not signed until July 1920, after the San Remo conference and replacement of the British OETA by a High Commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. The Report was submitted in August 1920, though never published, and was critical of both sides.

The report blamed the Zionists, &#x27;whose impatience to achieve their ultimate goal and indiscretion are largely responsible for this unhappy state of feeling’ and singled out Amin al-Husayni and Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky in particular. However, they incorrectly identified the anti-socialist Jabotinsky as organizer of the &quot;definite Bolshevist&quot; Poalei Zion (&#x27;Zionist Workers&#x27;) party.

The report was critical of some of the actions of OETA military command, particularly the withdrawal of troops from inside Jerusalem early on the morning of Monday, 5 April and that, once martial law had been proclaimed, it was slow to regain control.

==Aftermath==
Over 200 people were put on trial as a result of the riots, including 39 Jews. Musa Kazim al-Husayni was replaced as mayor by the head of the rival Nashashibi clan, Ragheb Bey Nashashibi. Amin al-Husayni and Aref al-Aref were arrested for incitement, but when they were let out on bail they both escaped to Syria. In another version, al-Aref was warned and escaped before being arrested. In their absence, a military court sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment.

The Arab riots were publicly protested by sheikhs from 82 villages in the Jerusalem and Jaffa areas who issued a formal statement saying that, in their view, Zionist settlement was not a danger to their communities. Similar declarations would be repeated in cablegrams sent to London in 1922, as hundreds of sheikhs and mukhtars lent their authority and support to Jewish immigration. The tenor of these positions was that such immigration would, as the Zionist movement itself affirmed, improve the lives of Arabs as industrial development progressed. The sheikhs protesting the riots, and telegramming later the British colonial secretary to express solidarity with the Zionist programme were sometimes bribed to state this position by the World Zionist Organisation. Their opinions were procured.
British soldiers were sent to search Jews for arms at the demand of the Palestinian Arab leadership. They searched the offices and apartments of Chaim Weizmann, the head of the Zionist Commission, and Jabotinsky. At Jabotinsky&#x27;s house, they found three rifles, two pistols, and 250 rounds of ammunition. Nineteen men were arrested, but not Jabotinsky, who went to the jail of his own volition to insist on his arrest. A military judge released him because he had not been home when the guns were discovered, but he was again arrested a few hours later. Jabotinsky was convicted of possessing the pistol that Storrs had confiscated on the riot&#x27;s first day, among other things. The primary witness was none other than Ronald Storrs, who said he &quot;did not remember&quot; being told about the self-defence organization. He was sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment and sent to Egypt, though the next day he was returned to Acre Prison. Jabotinsky&#x27;s trial and sentencing created an uproar, and were protested by London press including &quot;The Times&quot; and questioned in the British Parliament. Even before the editorials appeared, the commander of British forces in Palestine and Egypt, General Congreve, wrote Field Marshal Wilson that Jews were sentenced far more severely than Arabs who had committed worse offences. He reduced Jabotinsky&#x27;s sentence to a year, and that of the other 19 Jews arrested with him to six months.

The new civilian government under Herbert Samuel granted a general amnesty in early 1921. However, Amin al-Husayni and Aref al-Aref were excluded from the amnesty because they had fled before their convictions had been passed down. Samuel pardoned Amin in March 1921 and appointed him Mufti of Jerusalem. When the Supreme Muslim Council was created in the following year, Husayni demanded and received the title Grand Mufti, a position which came with life tenure. Also, General Storrs became the civil governor of Jerusalem under the new administration.

As the riots began, Jewish immigration to Palestine was temporarily halted by the British. Also, feeling that the British were unwilling to defend Jewish settlements from continuous Arab attacks, Palestinian Jews set up self-defense units, which came to be called the Haganah (&quot;defense&quot;). Furthermore, the riots increased the feeling of Palestinian nationalism within the Palestinian Arab community.

<doc id="434530" wikidata="Q7528760" url="?curid=434530" title="Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland">
<text>Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet (14 September 1741 – 2 September 1784) was a British colonial administrator who was the last colonial Governor of Maryland. Although a popular governor and an able administrator, Eden&#x27;s authority was overthrown by the events of the American Revolution, and in June 1776 he was invited by the Maryland Convention to leave for England. Eden was well-regarded at home and in the same year, 1776, he was made a baronet. He eventually returned to Maryland where he died in 1784 at the age of 42. He was buried in Annapolis and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Frederick, a noted author.

==Early life==
Eden was born in Durham, England, on 14 September 1741, the second son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland, and the brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley and a relative of North Carolina Governor Charles Eden.

==Career==
In 1763 Eden made an advantageous marriage, wedding Caroline Calvert, daughter of Maryland&#x27;s proprietor Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. In 1766 Caroline bore a son, Frederick. Three years later, in 1769, aged just 28, Robert Eden succeeded Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland, the highest office in the province. As governor, Eden would attempt to maintain authority over the increasingly rebellious province during the tumultuous years preceding the American Revolution.

===Maryland and the American War of Independence===

Eden was not among those who believed that coercion would force Marylanders into loyalty to the mother country. During the 1770s opposition to British taxation grew, and the governor&#x27;s authority began to falter. On 19 April 1774 Eden was forced to prorogue the Colonial Assembly, the last occasion on which it would convene. From this point on the government of Maryland was increasingly in the hands of the Revolutionaries. On 19 October 1774 the &quot;Peggy Stewart&quot; was burned in Annapolis harbor in protest against taxes on tea, in imitation of the famous Boston Tea Party, which took place on 16 December 1773.

On 30 December 1774 Eden wrote:

Although Eden had some sympathy with the colonists&#x27; grievances, he was firmly opposed to armed opposition to the Crown. In the event, Maryland was the only state that did not forcibly eject its last colonial governor from office, choosing instead a formal and largely courteous transfer of power. By 1775 Eden&#x27;s authority had been effectively usurped by the Annapolis Convention and Eden was eventually asked by the Maryland Council of Safety to step down as governor. The Maryland Convention had been pressed by the Continental Congress (and the Virginians in particular) to arrest and detain Eden but they demurred, preferring to avoid such an &quot;extreme&quot; measure. Instead they argued that:

Eventually the Maryland Convention formally asked the governor to leave, and Governor Eden finally departed Maryland for England in the ship &quot;Fowey&quot; on 23 June 1776.

He was created a baronet, of Maryland in North America, on 19 October 1776.

==Family life==

On 26 April 1763 Eden married Caroline Calvert, daughter of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, and in 1769 he succeeded Governor Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland. Caroline was half-sister to Benedict Swingate Calvert, a Judge of the Land office with whom Eden shared a love of horse racing. Benedict Swingate Calvert soon found himself appointed to the Governor&#x27;s Council.

His son Sir Frederick Morton Eden, 2nd Baronet, of Maryland (1766–1809) was a pioneering writer and the author of &quot;The State of the Poor&quot;, published in 3 volumes in 1797.


==Death and legacy==
Eden died on 2 September 1784 and was buried in Annapolis, Maryland. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Frederick. Eden was an ancestor of the 20th century British Prime Minister Anthony Eden. The town of Denton, Maryland, originally Edenton or Eden Town, was named for him.

<text>Eagle Rock is a neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, abutting the San Rafael Hills in Los Angeles County, California.
The community is named after Eagle Rock, a large boulder whose shadow resembles an eagle. Eagle Rock was once part of the Rancho San Rafael under Spanish and Mexican governorship. In 1911, Eagle Rock was incorporated as a city, and in 1923 it was annexed by Los Angeles.

The neighborhood is the home of Occidental College. As with other neighborhoods in Northeast Los Angeles, Eagle Rock experienced significant gentrification in the 21st century.

==History==

Before the arrival of European settlers, the secluded valley below the San Rafael Hills that is roughly congruent to Eagle Rock&#x27;s present boundaries was inhabited by the Tongva people, whose staple food was the acorns from the valley&#x27;s many oak trees. These aboriginal inhabitants were displaced by Spanish settlers in the late 18th century, with the area incorporated into the Rancho San Rafael. Following court battles, the area known as Rancho San Rafael was divided into 31 parcels in 1870. Benjamin Dreyfus was awarded what is now called Eagle Rock. In the 1880s Eagle Rock existed as a farming community.

The arrival of American settlers and the growth of Los Angeles resulted in steadily increasing semi-rural development in the region throughout the late 19th century. The construction of Henry Huntington&#x27;s Los Angeles Railway trolley line up Eagle Rock Boulevard to Colorado Boulevard and on Colorado to Townsend Avenue commenced the rapid suburbanization of the Eagle Rock Valley.

Although Eagle Rock, which is geographically located between the cities of Pasadena and Glendale, was once incorporated as a city in 1911, its need for an adequate water supply and a high school resulted in its annexation by Los Angeles in 1923.

Several major crime sprees occurred in the neighborhood during the late 20th century. An early victim of the Hillside Strangler was discovered in an Eagle Rock neighborhood on October 31, 1977. The discovery, along with the successive murders of at least 10 other women in the area over the course of five months, frightened local residents. According to an opinion piece by a resident under the pseudonym Deirdre Blackstone that was published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on December 6, 1977:

Groups of gum-chewing girls in look-alike hairdos and jeans who used to haunt the Eagle Rock Plaza—they too are keeping close to home ... We are all afraid. For women living alone, ours is an actual visceral fear that starts at the feet. Then it hits the knees—and finally it grips the mind.

Two men, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, were subsequently convicted of the murders.

On the night of March 20, 1985, an 8-year-old girl was abducted from her home in Eagle Rock and sexually assaulted by a man dubbed the &quot;Valley Intruder&quot;, &quot;Walk-in Killer&quot;, and &quot;The Night Stalker,&quot; later identified as Richard Ramirez. This was the seventh in a long string of murders and sexual assaults committed by Ramirez in Los Angeles and San Francisco before he was apprehended.

In 2002, an effort to designate an area of the community as &quot;Philippine Village&quot; for the large Filipino American population was stopped.

Like the surrounding areas of Northeast Los Angeles, Eagle Rock has undergone gentrification. Beginning in the 2000s, the area attracted young professionals and fostered a hipster culture. As a result, housing prices have dramatically risen and a new wave of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and art galleries have appeared over the last decade.

==Demographics==

The neighborhood is inhabited by a wide variety of ethnic and socioeconomic groups and the creative class. Over the past decade the Eagle Rock and neighboring Highland Park have been experiencing gentrification as young professionals have moved from nearby neighborhoods such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake. A core of counter-culture writers, artists and filmmakers has existed in Eagle Rock since the 1920s.

According to the &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; the 2000 U.S. census counted 32,493 residents in Eagle Rock neighborhood, 7,644 people per square mile; a population density considered average for the city and Los Angeles County. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 34,466. In 2000, the median age for residents was 35, about average for city and county neighborhoods.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;highly diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles, with a relatively high percentage of Asian people. The breakdown was Latinos, 40.3%; whites, 29.8%; Asians, 23.9%; blacks, 1.8%; and others, 4.1%. The Philippines (35.1%) and Mexico (25.1%) were the most common places of birth for the 38.5% of the residents who were born abroad—an average figure for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $67,253, considered high for the city. The neighborhood&#x27;s income levels, like its ethnic composition, can still be marked by notable diversity, but typically ranges from lower-middle to upper-middle class. Renters occupied 43.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 56.1%. The average household size of 2.8 people was considered normal for Los Angeles.

Thirty percent of Eagle Rock residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average percentage for the city.

==Geography==
Eagle Rock is bordered by Glendale on the north and west, Highland Park on the southeast, Glassell Park on the southwest, and Pasadena on the east. Major thoroughfares include Eagle Rock Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard, with Figueroa Street along the eastern boundary. The Glendale and Ventura freeways run along the district&#x27;s western and northern edges, respectively.

==Landmarks==

The neighborhood is home to many historic and architecturally significant homes, many done in the Craftsman, Georgian, Streamline Moderne, Art Deco and Mission Revival styles. There are nine Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in Eagle Rock:

==Education==

===Higher education===
Eagle Rock is the site of Occidental College, which was first established in Boyle Heights in 1887. After a fire destroyed the original campus in 1896, it moved to Downtown Los Angeles, then Highland Park, until reopening permanently in Eagle Rock in 1914. The campus was designed by architect Myron Hunt.

===Schools===
Eagle Rock children attend schools in District 4 of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

* Eagle Rock High School, 1750 Yosemite Drive. Eagle Rock High School was built in 1927 by the city of Los Angeles, as promised at the time of Eagle Rock&#x27;s annexation. The original building was demolished in 1970 over concerns about its earthquake safety. It was replaced by a contemporary brutalist style building at the rear of the same school site.
* Renaissance Arts Academy, charter high school, 1800 Colorado Boulevard
* Dahlia Heights Elementary School, 5063 Floristan Avenue
* Santa Rosa Charter Academy, middle school, 3838 Eagle Rock Boulevard

==Tiny Homes Village==

In March 2022, then Councilmember for Eagle Rock, Kevin De Leon and then Mayor Of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti opened Eagle Rock&#x27;s Tiny Homes Village, the tenth such community in Los Angeles. These communities are sometimes included as part of the Tiny-house_movement. The community was placed near the junction of North Figueroa Street and Colorado Blvd, near the 134 Freeway exit, and just a few hundred yards from the Eagle Rock geological landmark.

Like other Tiny Homes Villages in Los Angeles, the community serves as transitional housing for homeless people formerly living in tents or their cars.

<doc id="434532" wikidata="Q935436" url="?curid=434532" title="George Kelly (psychologist)">
<text>George Alexander Kelly (April 28, 1905 – March 6, 1967) was an American psychologist, therapist, educator and personality theorist. He is considered a founding figure in the history of clinical psychology and is best known for his theory of personality, personal construct psychology. Kelly&#x27;s work has influenced many areas of psychology—including constructivist, humanistic, existential, and cognitive psychology.

==Biography==

George Alexander Kelly was born in 1905 on a farm near Perth, Kansas to two strictly religious parents. He was their only child. They moved frequently during his childhood years, resulting in a fragmented early education. He later attended Friends University and Park College, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics and mathematics. Early on, he was interested in social problems, and he went on to get his master&#x27;s degree in sociology at the University of Kansas, where he wrote a thesis on workers&#x27; leisure activities. He also completed minor studies in labor relations.

Kelly taught at various colleges and other institutions, with course topics ranging from speech-making to &quot;Americanization&quot;. In 1929, after receiving an exchange scholarship, he completed a Bachelor of Education degree at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, writing a thesis dealing with the prediction of teaching success. He then returned to the United States to continue psychology studies and completed a graduate and doctoral degrees in psychology at the State University of Iowa in 1931. After he received his Ph.D. in psychology, Kelly worked as a psychotherapist in Kansas. His dissertation was on speech and reading disabilities. For some years before World War II, Kelly worked in school psychology, developing a program of traveling clinics which also served as a training ground for his students. He had a keen interest in clinical diagnosis. It was during this period that Kelly left behind this interest in psychoanalytic approach to human personality, because he said people were more troubled by natural disasters than any psychological issue, such as the libidinal forces.

During World War II, Dylan Brundage and Kelly worked as aviation psychologists, where, among other things, Kelly was responsible for a training program for local civilian pilots. After the war and a brief tenure as a psychology faculty member at the University of Maryland, he was appointed professor and director of clinical psychology at the Ohio State University, where he remained until 1965. Under his guidance, OSU&#x27;s graduate psychology training programs became some of the best in the United States, offering a unique blend of clinical skills and a strong commitment to scientific methodology.

It is also at OSU that Kelly developed his major contribution to the psychology of personality. &quot;The Psychology of Personal Constructs&quot; was published in 1955 and achieved immediate international recognition, gaining him visiting appointments at various universities in the US as well as in Europe, the former Soviet Union, South America, the Caribbean, and Asia. He was also elected president of the clinical and the consulting divisions of the American Psychological Association, and served as president of the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology, providing expertise and insight, especially regarding ethical issues.

Kelly went on a world tour in 1961, invited to speak about his essays and articles all over the country. In 1964, Kelly wrote a paper for the First Old Saybrook Conference, which has been renamed to Association for Humanistic Psychology (AHP). Kelly&#x27;s paper, &quot;The threat of aggression&quot;, was later published in the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot;. Kelly transferred from Ohio State University to Brandeis University in the United States for the psychology department.

Kelly noted: &quot;Johann Herbart&#x27;s work on education and particularly mathematical psychology influenced me. I think mathematics is the pure instance of construct functioning—the model of human behavior&quot; Although Kelly was influenced by Herbart—a philosopher, psychologist, and founder of pedagogy as an academic discipline—some of Kelly&#x27;s inspiration for the theory of personal constructs came from a close friend of his. Namely, this friend had been an actor in some drama in college, and for two or three weeks he really got into his character and lived it as it was the real him. Kelly, unlike many people who would see this only as a sheer affectation, thought this was the expression of his real self and the behavior was authentic.

Kelly also worked extensively on researching the implications and applications of his theory, while continuing to work in clinical psychology. Joseph Rychlak is among his prominent students who expanded on his theories. Brendan A. Maher, who became a professor himself, published a selection of Kelly&#x27;s essays and articles after his death. Kelly had all his students refer to him as &quot;Professor Kelly&quot;, however when they would receive a Ph.D. dissertation they could call him George and he would also call them by their first name instead of &quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, or &quot;Mister&quot;.

George Kelly left OSU to take an endowed faculty position as the Mashulam and Judith Riklis Chair in Behavioral Science at Brandeis University in 1965. Kelly died on March 6, 1967, at the age of 61, just two years after accepting the Riklis Chair of Behavioral Science at Brandeis University.

Kelly&#x27;s ideas are still used in today&#x27;s findings to explore personality into greater depths. His ideas also help to uncover the patterns of behavior.

== Work ==
=== Kelly&#x27;s concerns ===

Kelly did not like his theory being compared to other theories. Oftentimes, people believed Kelly&#x27;s personal construct theory was similar to humanistic theories or cognitive theories, but Kelly thought of his theory as its own category of theories. Some say Kelly was similar to Ulric Neisser, &quot;the father of cognitive psychology&quot;, because they both studied cognitive psychology characteristics, others say Kelly was similar to Abraham Maslow, the creator of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, because they both studied humanistic psychology characteristics. Although Kelly&#x27;s research had some humanistic psychology characteristics, it differed from that field in many ways as well. Kelly rejected being labelled as a cognitive psychologist—to the extent that he almost wrote another book stating his theory had no link to cognitive theories.

Kelly saw that current theories of were so loosely defined and difficult to test that in many clinical cases the observer contributed more to the diagnosis than the patient. If people took their problems to a Freudian analyst, they would be analysed in Freudian terms; a Jungian would interpret them in Jungian terms; a behaviourist would interpret them in terms of conditioning; and so on.

Kelly acknowledged that both the therapist and patient would each bring a unique set of constructs to bear in the consulting room. Therefore, the therapist could never be completely &quot;objective&quot; in construing their client&#x27;s world. The effective therapist was, however, one who construed the patient&#x27;s material at a high level of abstraction within the patient&#x27;s (as opposed to the therapist&#x27;s) system of construction. The therapist could then comprehend the ways in which the patient saw the world that were disordered and help the patient to change their maladaptive constructs.

=== Personal construct psychology ===

Kelly&#x27;s fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. Personal construct theory explores the individual&#x27;s map they form by coping with the psychological stresses of their lives. But because people are &quot;naive&quot; scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one&#x27;s changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.)

The body of Kelly&#x27;s work, &quot;The Psychology of Personal Constructs&quot;, was written in 1955 when Kelly was a professor at Ohio State University. The first three chapters of the book were republished by W. W. Norton in paperback in 1963 and consist only of his theory of personality which is covered in most personality books. The re-publication omitted Kelly&#x27;s assessment technique, the rep grid test, and one of his techniques of psychotherapy (&quot;fixed role therapy&quot;), which is rarely practiced in the form he proposed.

Kelly believed that each person had their own idea of what a word meant. If someone were to say their sister is shy, the word &quot;shy&quot; would be interpreted in different ways depending on the person&#x27;s personal constructs they had already associated with the word &quot;shy&quot;. Kelly wanted to know how the individual made sense of the world based on their constructs. Kelly believed that a person&#x27;s own meaning and definition is the foundation of who and what that person is and helps give shape to a person&#x27;s idea of what the world is based on their individual constructs.

On the other hand, Kelly&#x27;s fundamental view of people as naive scientists was incorporated into most later-developed forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy that blossomed in the late 70s and early 80s, and into intersubjective psychoanalysis which leaned heavily on Kelly&#x27;s phenomenological perspective and his notion of schematic processing of social information. Kelly&#x27;s personality theory was distinguished from drive theories (such as psychodynamic models) on the one hand, and from behavioral theories on the other, in that people were not seen as solely motivated by instincts (such as sexual and aggressive drives) or learning history but by their need to characterize and predict events in their social world. Because the constructs people developed for construing experience have the potential to change, Kelly&#x27;s theory of personality is less deterministic than drive theory or learning theory. People could conceivably change their view of the world and in so doing change the way they interacted with it, felt about it, and even others&#x27; reactions to them. For this reason, it is an existential theory, regarding humankind as having a choice to reconstrue themselves, a concept Kelly referred to as &quot;constructive alternativism&quot;. Constructs provide a certain order, clarity, and prediction to a person&#x27;s world. Kelly referenced many philosophers in his two volumes but the theme of new experience being at once novel and familiar (due to the templates placed on it) is closely akin to the notion of Heraclitus: &quot;we step and do not step in the same rivers.&quot; Experience is new but familiar to the extent that it is construed with historically derived constructs.

Kelly defined constructs as bipolar categories—the way two things are alike and different from a third—that people employ to understand the world. Examples of such constructs are &quot;attractive,&quot; &quot;intelligent,&quot; &quot;kind.&quot; A construct always implies contrast. So when an individual categorizes others as attractive, or intelligent, or kind, an opposite polarity is implied. This means that such a person may also evaluate the others in terms of the constructs &quot;ugly,&quot; &quot;stupid,&quot; or &quot;cruel.&quot; In some cases, when a person has a disordered construct system, the opposite polarity is unexpressed or idiosyncratic. The importance of a particular construct varies among individuals. The adaptiveness of a construct system is measured by how well it applies to the situation at hand and is useful in predicting events. All constructs are not used in every situation because they have a limited range (range of convenience). Adaptive people are continually revising and updating their own constructs to match new information (or data) that they encounter in their experience.

Kelly&#x27;s theory was structured as a testable scientific treatise with a fundamental postulate and a set of corollaries.

* Fundamental postulate: &quot;A person&#x27;s processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which he [or she] anticipates events.&quot;
* The construction corollary: &quot;a person anticipates events by construing their replications.&quot; This means that individuals anticipate events in their social world by perceiving a similarity with a past event (construing a replication).
* The experience corollary: &quot;a person&#x27;s construction system varies as he successively construes the replication of events.&quot;
* The dichotomy corollary: &quot;a person&#x27;s construction system is composed of a finite number of dichotomous constructs.&quot;
* The organization corollary: &quot;each person characteristically evolves, for his convenience in anticipating events, a construction system embracing ordinal relationships between constructs.&quot;
* The range corollary: &quot;a construct is convenient for the anticipation of a finite range of events only.&quot;
* The modulation corollary: &quot;the variation in a person&#x27;s construction system is limited by the permeability of the constructs within whose range of convenience the variants lie.&quot;
* The choice corollary: &quot;a person chooses for himself that alternative in a dichotomized construct through which he anticipates the greater possibility for extension and definition of his system.&quot;
* The individuality corollary: &quot;persons differ from each other in their construction of events.&quot;
* The commonality corollary: &quot;to the extent that one person employs a construction of experience which is similar to that employed by another, his psychological processes are similar to the other person.&quot;
* The fragmentation corollary: &quot;a person may successively employ a variety of construction subsystems which are inferentially incompatible with each other.&quot;
* The sociality corollary: &quot;to the extent that one person construes the construction processes of another, he may play a role in a social process involving the other person.&quot;

Disordered constructs are those in which the system of construction is not useful in predicting social events and fails to change to accommodate new information. In many ways, Kelly&#x27;s theory of psychopathology (or mental disorders) is similar to the elements that define a poor theory. A disordered construct system does not accurately predict events or accommodate new data.

===Dimensions of transitions===

Transitional periods in a person&#x27;s life occur when they encounter a situation that changes their naive theory (or system of construction) of the way the world is ordered. They can create anxiety, hostility, and/or guilt and can also be opportunities to change one&#x27;s constructs and the way one views the world.

The terms &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;hostility&quot;, and &quot;guilt&quot; had unique definitions and meanings in personal construct theory (&quot;The Psychology of Personal Constructs&quot;, Vol. 1, 486–534).

&quot;Anxiety&quot; develops when a person encounters a situation that their construct system does not cover, an event unlike any they have encountered. An example of such a situation is a woman from the western United States who is accustomed to earthquakes, who moves to the eastern United States and experiences great anxiety because of a hurricane. While an earthquake might be of greater magnitude, she experiences greater anxiety with the hurricane because she has no constructs to deal with such an event. She is caught &quot;with her constructs down.&quot; Similarly, a boy who has been abused in early childhood may not have the constructs to accommodate kindness from others. Such a boy might experience anxiety in an outstretched hand that others view as benevolent.

&quot;Guilt&quot; is dislodgement from one&#x27;s core constructs. A person feels guilt if they fail to confirm the constructs that define them. This definition of guilt is radically different from in other theories of personality. Kelly used the example of the man who regards others as cow-like creatures &quot;making money and giving milk.&quot; Such a man might construe his role in relationship to others in terms of his ability to con favors or money from them. Such a man, who other psychologists might call a ruthless psychopath, and see as unable to experience guilt, feels guilt, according to Kelly&#x27;s theory, when he is unable to con others: He is then alienated from his core constructs.

&quot;Hostility&quot; is &quot;attempting to extort confirmation of a social prediction that is already failing.&quot; When a person encounters a situation in which they expect one outcome and receive quite a different one, they should change their theory or constructs rather than trying to change the situation to match their constructs. But the person who continually refuses to modify their belief system to accommodate new data, and in fact tries to change the data, is acting in bad faith and with hostility. Hostility, in Kelly&#x27;s theory, is analogous to a scientist &quot;fudging&quot; their data. An example might be a professor who sees himself as a brilliant educator who deals with poor student reviews by devaluing the students or the means of evaluation.

=== Rep test ===

&quot;Rep&quot; stands for repertory grid. In 1955, George Kelly created an interactive grid known as the rep test based on his personal construct theory. The repertory grid is a mathematical way of giving meaning to one&#x27;s own, or other people&#x27;s, personal constructs. The repertory grid test needs a set of elements (such as people or things), and a set of constructs created by the individual. The test asks a person to list people or things that are important, then the responses are split into groups of three. There are three role-titles in each row; the person is to think how two of the constructs are alike, and how the other is different from the two that are alike. The responses are sorted into two poles, an emergent pole and implicit pole. The emergent pole is the way in which two elements are similar, while the implicit pole is the way in which the third element differs from the two that are similar. After extracting a construct, the individual analyzes the role-titles and checks the elements that are best described under the emergent pole and leaves blank the elements best described under the implicit pole. Kelly&#x27;s repertory grid test can be used in many different situations, from clinical psychology to marketing, due to its ability to apply constructs to any kind of event. Kelly believed the repertory grid provided a &quot;basis for a mathematics of psychological space&quot;—a way to mathematically model any person&#x27;s &quot;psychological space&quot;.

<text>The North–South Line (NSL) is a high-capacity Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore, operated by SMRT Corporation. Coloured red on the Singapore rail map, the line is long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the Braddell and Marina South Pier stations, are underground. It runs from Jurong East station, located in Western Singapore, to Marina South Pier station in the Central Area, via Woodlands station in northern Singapore. The line operates for almost 20 hours a day (from approximately 5am to 1am the next day), with headways of 1 to 2 minutes during peak hours and 5 to 6 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the North–South Line run with a six-car formation.

It was the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from Yio Chu Kang station to Toa Payoh station beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to Raffles Place station on 12 December the same year and northwards to Yishun station on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to Marina Bay station opened on 4 November 1989, the North–South Line was formed and split from the East–West Line. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the Branch line via Woodlands through the Woodlands line extension.

Since the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the North–South Line (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on this line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the C151B, C151C and R151) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The North–South Line is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting it from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to Marina South Pier station on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, Canberra station, on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations (Brickland and Sungei Kadut stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.

==History==
===Initial developments===
The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) originated from a forecast in 1967 by the planners of the State and City Planning Project, which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, then-Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong came to the conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in the land-scarce country.

After deciding on a rail-based system, the construction of Phase I of the MRT system, which will be the North–South Line, was given priority as the line passes through areas having a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio and the Central Area. The line was expected to relieve the traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang road corridor. Construction of the MRT line (and also the MRT system itself) started on 22 October 1983, and the first section from Yio Chu Kang station to Toa Payoh station opened on 7 November 1987. At the inauguration ceremony, Ong Teng Cheong, who backed and commissioned the planning of the MRT system, attended the ceremony as a special Guest of Honour. Dr Yeo Ning Hong, the Minister For Communications and Information, inaugurated the start of MRT operations and announced it to be the &quot;beginning&quot; of the MRT system.

Nine more stations from Novena station to Outram Park station via Raffles Place opened on 12 December that year. The line was extended northward to Yishun station on 20 December 1988 as part of phase 2B and it began independent operations on 4 November 1989 as the North–South Line when the extension to Marina Bay station was opened.

===Woodlands extension===
After the Branch line (from the Jurong East to Choa Chu Kang stations) opened in 1990, the Woodlands MRT line was envisioned so as to close the gap between Yishun and Choa Chu Kang stations. Numerous changes were made to the number of stations for the extension mainly to accommodate the 1991 Concept Plan by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which aimed to make Woodlands a regional centre for northern Singapore.

During the initial planning of the line, Sembawang station was only intended as a provisional station, to be built at a later date due to the underdevelopment of Sembawang, and construction began on 19 November 1992. Sembawang station and Kranji station were later included in the construction after the second round of planning (construction began at the same time on 19 November 1992) and Sungei Kadut station was then omitted. Sungei Kadut will be built later if the town&#x27;s population justifies the necessity for the station.

During the construction, a total of 19 new trains were purchased for almost S$259 million for the new MRT line, designed by German company Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, to complement the 66 first-generation C151 trains. There was also a need to level the land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang for the MRT line.

With the official opening of the Woodlands extension on 10 February 1996 by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, the Branch line was incorporated into the North–South Line. The extension was built at a cost of $1.2 billion.
===Subsequent developments===
The NSL platforms of the Bishan station underwent major alterations to increase the passenger capacity of the station from 1,250 to 2,020. A new air-conditioned platform to serve southbound trains then to Marina Bay was constructed and opened for service on 27 July 2008, connected to Junction 8 via Exit E. The station was expanded to handle increased passenger traffic when the CCL station opens. As the original platform, now serving northbound trains to Jurong East, remained in service, upgrading works for the platform (Platform A) was hindered and took about a year to complete. While the re-tiling of the platform was done during the day, the Platform Screen Doors (PSDs) were installed in sections through the night. An air-conditioning system was also installed as part of the upgrade. Upgrading works for the platform were fully completed on 23 May 2009.

Under the Land Transport Master Plan 2008, the Jurong East Modification Project entailed the construction of a new platform and the addition of a fourth track to Jurong East station to reduce waiting times and crowding at the station during peak hours. The modification project was completed on 27 May 2011. The track and platform was initially opened during morning peak hours only, but since December 2011, they also operate during the evening peak hours.

In the 2008 Land Transport Master Plan, the North–South Line extension was announced as one of the upcoming projects rolled out by the Land Transport Authority to expand Singapore&#x27;s rail network. The one kilometre extension from Marina Bay to Marina South Pier station was opened on 23 November 2014. This extension serves the Marina South Pier, the Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore, and future developments in the Marina Bay Downtown area.

On 17 January 2013, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that a feasibility study was conducted to construct Canberra MRT station. The feasibility study was completed in 2014 and LTA announced Canberra as a new station. Construction of Canberra station commenced on 26 March 2016. The station, which is an infill station with side platforms, was built along an operational section of the line between Sembawang and Yishun. The station cost S$90 million to build, and is meant to serve upcoming developments at the vicinity. Canberra station opened on 2 November 2019.

===Incidents===
On 3 March 2003, a 23-year-old man lost control of his vehicle along Lentor Avenue, crashed through the fence, and landed on a stretch of track between Yio Chu Kang and Khatib stations. The incident forced a train carrying hundreds of commuters to come to a screeching halt, but not before flattening the front of the car. The accident disrupted train services for more than three hours and cost SMRT between S$100,000 and $150,000 in damages and lost revenue.

On 15 December 2011, train services between Bishan and Marina Bay stations were disrupted due to damage sustained on the power rail between City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut. Trains along this stretch were stalled and caused a service disruption until 11:40pm on that day. Two days later, a similar problem caused a seven-hour disruption between Ang Mo Kio and Marina Bay. According to SMRT, the disruption was caused by damage to the third rail and the trains&#x27; collector shoes. Seven trains were damaged in this incident. These two service disruptions on the North–South line were both related to damaged rail, and became one of the worst disruption since SMRT&#x27;s inception in 1987.

On 7 July 2015, train services on the North–South and East–West lines were temporarily disrupted due to massive power trips detected along both lines. A cause of the disruption was due to damaged insulators which caused a failure to properly supply power. For this disruption that brought inconvenience to 413,000 commuters, LTA imposed a &#x27;record&#x27; fine of S$5.4 million on SMRT.

On 7 October 2017, a 20-hour long disruption started due to flooding in the tunnels between Braddell station and Bishan station due to a faulty drainage system, resulting in disruption of train services between Ang Mo Kio and Marina South Pier stations in both directions for several hours. A trackside fire between Raffles Place and Marina Bay stations further exacerbated the disruption. Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton resumed at about 9:20pm on the same day, followed by Newton and Ang Mo Kio at around 2pm the following day. Although no injuries or casualties were reported, SMRT fired a total of eight employees from the maintenance crew, and incurred a S$2 million fine, following the incident.

On 14 October 2020, train services from Jurong East to Woodlands stations were disrupted for more than three and a half hours, owing to a faulty power cable, which affected the East–West Line and Circle Line too. The power fault began at 7pm and by 7:30pm, commuters were stuck in the trains. Free bus bridging services were activated at all affected stations, and bus operators increased the frequency of regular services serving these areas. Service resumed at all stations along the North–South and East–West Lines at 10:35pm. A total of 36 stations were affected by the power fault. The incident led to a replacement of 150km of power cables for the Tuas West Extension and two SMRT staff being suspended.

On 27 October 2023, trains skipped Novena MRT station for about 2 hours during the evening travel peak, after an air-conditioning unit filled the underground station with smoke. Free bus bridging services were provided between Newton MRT station and Toa Payoh MRT station, and ended shortly after the station was reopened at around 7:30pm.

On 3 June 2024, around 5.50pm, a lightning strike caused traction power to trip, as well as a small fire breaking out in a power control box next to the train track located about 20 meters from the platform of Kranji MRT station. No injuries were reported. This resulted in train services to be suspended between Choa Chu Kang and Woodlands stations for more than two hours. According to the Singapore Civil Defence Force, the fire had burned itself out before its officers arrived. Train services were progressively restored at 8.10pm.

===Future plans===

In the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 (LTMP2040), two new infill stations are projected to be built along the existing North–South Line. Brickland station will be built between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations, while Sungei Kadut station will be built between Yew Tee and Kranji stations and provide an additional interchange with the Downtown Line. Both stations are expected to be completed by around mid-2030s.

==Network and operations==
===Services===
Train services on the North–South Line operates from approximately 5:30am to around midnight daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 2 to 3 minutes while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 5 minutes throughout the entire route. Each day, the first train begins service at the following timings:

* 4:59 am (5:19 am on Sundays and public holidays) from Jurong East to Yew Tee stations, which will reach one loop at 5:27 am.
* 5:00 am (5:22 am on Sundays and public holidays) from Ang Mo Kio to Yew Tee stations, which will reach Yew Tee at 5:33 am.
* 5:05 am (5:25 am on Sundays and public holidays) from Jurong East to Ang Mo Kio stations, which will reach Ang Mo Kio at 5:48 am.
* 5:10 am (5:30 am on Sundays and public holidays) from Ang Mo Kio as downroute to start at Bishan station, which will reach Bishan at 5:45 am.

Extra downroute trips were added to start from Newton, Bishan and Kranji to cater to the demand. From 11pm onwards, selected trains from Jurong East station will terminate at either Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh or Yew Tee stations. Selected trains departing from Marina South Pier station will also terminate at Kranji, Yishun or Ang Mo Kio stations in the late evenings. There are no express services. Additionally, short-working trips do run from Yishun to Marina South Pier, which only operate during peak hours. 

In the late 2010s, services on the North–South Line were also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays, with shuttle bus services occasionally provided throughout the duration of the early closures and late openings for affected commuters. Operations of the North–South Line were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the drop in ridership.

===Route===

The North–South line forms an incomplete loop from Jurong East in the West Region of Singapore, north to Woodlands and Sembawang, and south to the Central Area. It is long and is predominantly double-tracked, but certain short sections at the Woodlands, Yishun and Ang Mo Kio stations widen to three tracks, and four tracks at Jurong East station. The line begins above ground at Jurong East station from where it continues north on a set of elevated viaducts, with the exception of a short tunnel between the Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak stations, and a surface section of track between the Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. The line curves from the Yew Tee to Kranji stations and continues eastwards, paralleling Woodlands Avenue 3 (which the line briefly cuts underneath between Kranji and Marsiling stations) and Avenue 7 main roads.

After Sembawang station, the line follows the route of Canberra Link and Yishun Avenue 2, curving southwards. Between Khatib and Yio Chu Kang stations parallel to Lentor Avenue, the line continues at surface level; this section is the longest distance between any two MRT stations in Singapore. The line continues above ground for the Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio stations, then it goes back to surface level for Bishan station, the MRT system&#x27;s only at-grade station. A branch line to Bishan Depot exists between the Ang Mo Kio and Bishan stations. After Bishan, the line goes underground through the Central Area. The North–South Line runs parallel to the East–West Line at the City Hall and Raffles Place stations, which are also cross-platform interchanges to the East–West Line. The line ends at Marina South Pier station.

===Stations===
The line serves 27 MRT stations across of track, and station codes for the line are red, corresponding to the line&#x27;s colour on the system map. 11 stations, from Braddell to Marina South Pier are underground, with the rest being ground-level or elevated. With the exception of Bishan, Braddell and Canberra stations, the other stations have island platforms.

==Infrastructure==
===Rolling stock===
Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) trains on the North–South Line operate in a six-car formation, based out of Bishan Depot and Ulu Pandan Depot, which provide train maintenance, inspection and overhaul facilities. This rolling stock is shared with the East–West Line, with an electrification of 750 V DC powered by a third rail. With the exception of the C651 and R151 trains, the current rolling stock was manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, in a joint venture with CRRC Qingdao Sifang for the subsequent rolling stocks of the C151A, C151B and C151C trains. When the initial line opened, the rolling stock of the North–South Line consisted of 66 first-generation C151 trains only. The 19 second-generation C651 trains were introduced during the Woodlands extension to complement the existing 66 first-generation C151 trains. The 21 third-generation C751B trains were introduced during the Changi Airport extension to complement the existing 66 first-generation C151 trains and 19 second-generation C651 trains. In 2011, the fourth-generation C151A trains were introduced, increasing the passenger capacity of both the North–South and East–West lines by 15%. The C151A trains were the first successful joint venture between Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CSR Qingdao Sifang in the international market.

As part of efforts to further increase passenger capacity on the line, newer C151B and C151C trains were subsequently delivered in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The introduction of the C151B trains saw the introduction of STARiS 2.0, which is also seen in subsequent rolling stocks. The C151C trains are also the first MRT rolling stock on the NSEWL to be fitted with tip-up seats, in addition to the current features of the C151B trains.

Another generation of rolling stock, the R151 trains, will be delivered from 2022 to 2026, to replace all 66 first-generation C151 trains which will be retired by 2025, as well as all 19 second-generation C651 and 21 third-generation C751B trains which were fully phased out by 2024. The R151 trains will be the first rolling stock on the North–South Line to be manufactured by Bombardier Transportation (Bought by Alstom in 2021), which has also supplied trains for the Downtown Line.

===Signalling===
Initially, the North–South line used a semi-automatic signalling system consisting of the Westinghouse fixed block signalling system with automatic train control under automatic train operation Grades of Automation (GoA) 2. However, the ageing system had undermined the rail reliability on the line, requiring the NSL to upgrade its signalling system. Since 2019, the North–South Line is fully equipped with Thales SelTrac Communications-based train control moving block signalling system with automatic train control under automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 3. The subsystems consist of automatic train protection to govern train speed, NetTrac MT Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and a Computer-based interlocking system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.

A new moving-block signalling system, supplied by Thales, replaced the ageing fixed-block signalling system on the North–South Line. The upgrading works were completed in phases from 2016. With the upgraded signalling system, trains are now able to run closer to each other. The new system was tested on the evening of 28 March 2017. Train services were paused for ten minutes as the old signalling system was being changed to the new system. From 16 April 2017, the new system commenced full-day testing on Sundays for two months. The new C151B rolling stock were first introduced to the line on these testing days. Since 28 May 2017, the new signalling system has been operating full-day on the North–South Line. The old signalling system then ceased operations on 2 January 2019.

===Platform screen doors===

When the line was first opened, full-height platform screen doors supplied by Westinghouse were installed at underground stations. These doors serve to prevent suicides, enable climate control within the station, better security control by restricting access to the tunnels and tracks and for overall passenger safety considerations. The authorities initially rejected calls for platform screen doors to be installed at elevated stations by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs. Nevertheless, the LTA reversed its decision and made plans to install half-height platform screen doors on elevated stations on 25 January 2008. The first platform screen doors by ST Electronics were installed at Pasir Ris, Jurong East and Yishun stations in 2009 as trial runs. Subsequently, installation began in May 2011 at Ang Mo Kio station. On 14 March 2012, platform screen doors became operational at all elevated stations on the North–South Line.

===Rail===
The NSL was built with wooden sleepers, which needed to be replaced when they neared the end of their lifespan of 15 to 25 years. The replacement sleepers, made out of concrete, have a significantly longer lifespan and enable smoother and safer rides. Since 2014, train services on the line have ended earlier for critical maintenance works, with the exception of a break between September 2016 and December 2016.

Trains on the NSL are powered via a third rail. However, constant contact between the train&#x27;s Current Collector Devices (CCD) and the line saw the need for replacement works on the third rail, which were completed in August 2017. The new third rail replaced its 30-year-old predecessor, which was used since the opening of the line. The new electrical system is expected to make train services more reliable.

<doc id="434535" wikidata="Q673873" url="?curid=434535" title="Marquess of Lansdowne">
<text>Marquess of Lansdowne is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain created in 1784, and held by the head of the Petty-Fitzmaurice family. The first Marquess served as Prime Minister of Great Britain.

==Origins==
This branch of the Fitzmaurice family descends from John Fitzmaurice, second son of Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry (see Earl of Kerry for earlier history of the family), and his wife Anne, the daughter of the political economist Sir William Petty, whose wife had been created Baroness Shelburne for her own life only and whose two sons had been created at different times Baron Shelburne in the peerage of Ireland and Earl of Shelburne respectively, but who had both died without heirs. In 1751, on the death of his maternal uncle Henry Petty, Earl of Shelburne, John Fitzmaurice succeeded to his estates and assumed by Act of Parliament the surname of Petty in addition to FitzMaurice. That same year, he was created Viscount FitzMaurice and Baron Dunkeron in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1753, the earldom held by his uncle was revived when he was made Earl of Shelburne, in the County of Wexford, in the Peerage of Ireland. He later represented Wycombe in the House of Commons as a Whig, his Irish peerages not disbarring him. However, in 1760 Viscount FitzMaurice was created Baron Wycombe, of Chepping Wycombe in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords at Westminster and meant that he could no longer sit in the Commons.

Through his first wife Lady Sophia Carteret (1745–1771), only daughter of Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville, Fitzmaurice acquired large estates, including Lansdowne Hill near Bath, from which his son later took a new title. 

From 1765 until the Reform Act 1832, the head of the family controlled the two seats in parliament of the pocket borough of Calne in Wiltshire. After 1832, there was only one seat and a wider franchise, but a member of the family was usually elected until the borough was abolished in 1885.

==Creations==
The first Earl of Shelburne of the new creation was succeeded by his eldest son William Petty-FitzMaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. He was a prominent statesman and served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1782 to 1783. His brother Thomas FitzMaurice (1742–1793) of Cliveden, was a Member of Parliament. 
In 1784, the second Earl of Shelburne was created Marquess of Lansdowne, in the County of Somerset, Earl of Wycombe, of Chepping Wycombe, and Viscount Calne and Calston, referring to Calne and Calstone in the County of Wiltshire, all in the Peerage of Great Britain. However, he is better known to history under his former title of Earl of Shelburne. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Sophia Carteret, John Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 2nd Marquess of Lansdowne. He died childless in 1809 and was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Marquess, the son of their father’s second marriage, to Lady Louisa FitzPatrick. Known as Lord Henry Petty from 1784 to 1809, he was one of the most influential Whig politicians of the first half of the 19th century. In a ministerial career spanning over fifty years, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1806 to 1807, as Home Secretary from 1827 to 1828, as Lord President of the Council from 1830 to 1834, 1835 to 1841, and 1846 to 1852, and as Minister without Portfolio from 1852 to 1858. He twice declined to become Prime Minister and in 1857 refused the offer of a dukedom from Queen Victoria. In 1818 Lansdowne also succeeded his cousin as fourth Earl of Kerry. His eldest son William Petty FitzMaurice, Earl of Kerry, was a Member of Parliament for Calne, but predeceased his father, without having a son. Lansdowne was therefore succeeded by his second son, the fourth Marquess. He had already in 1856 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Wycombe and served under Lord Palmerston as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1856 to 1858. He married as his second wife Emily Jane Mercer-Elphinstone-de Flahault, 8th Lady Nairne (see the Lord Nairne), eldest daughter of the French general and statesman Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, and his wife Margaret Nairne, 7th Lady Nairne.
He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, the fifth Marquess. Like his grandfather, he was a prominent statesman and had an equally long ministerial career. Lord Lansdowne was Governor General of Canada from 1883 to 1888, Viceroy of India from 1888 to 1894, Secretary of State for War from 1895 to 1900, Foreign Secretary from 1900 to 1905, Leader of the Conservative Party in the Lords from 1911 to 1916, and also served in the war-time coalition government as Minister without Portfolio from 1915 to 1916. In 1895 he succeeded his mother as Lord Nairne. His eldest son, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, sat as Unionist Member of Parliament for West Derbyshire from 1908 to 1918 and was a Senator of the Irish Free State in 1922. In 1927 he succeeded his father and became the 6th Marquess. 

On his death in 1936 he was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the seventh Marquess, who was killed in action in 1944 during the Second World War, unmarried. As the third and youngest brother, Lord Edward Norman Petty-Fitzmaurice, had been killed in action only a week before, the Scottish lordship of Nairne was passed on to their eldest sister Katherine (see Lord Nairne for later history of this title). Lord Lansdowne was survived in the remaining titles by his first cousin, the eighth Marquess. He was the son of Major Lord Charles George Francis Mercer Nairne Petty-Fitzmaurice (1874–1914), second son of the fifth Marquess. Born George John Charles Mercer Nairne, he assumed by Decree of the Lord Lyon the additional surnames of Petty-Fitzmaurice in 1947. Lord Lansdowne sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1958 to 1962 and as Minister of State for Colonial Affairs from 1962 to 1964. As of 2014 the titles are held by his eldest son, the ninth Marquess, who succeeded in 1999.

The courtesy title for the Lord Lansdowne&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent alternates between &quot;Earl of Kerry&quot; and &quot;Earl of Shelburne&quot;.

The family seat is Bowood House, near Calne, Wiltshire. The family&#x27;s former London residence was Lansdowne House in Berkeley Square. A major late-1990s/early-2000s housing development in the northwest of Calne was named Lansdowne Park after the local seat.

<text>The Jaffa riots (commonly known in ) were a series of violent riots in Mandatory Palestine on May 1–7, 1921, which began as a confrontation between two Jewish groups but developed into an attack by Arabs on Jews and then reprisal attacks by Jews on Arabs. The rioting began in Jaffa and spread to other parts of the country. The riot resulted in the deaths of 47 Jews and 48 Arabs, with 146 Jews and 73 Arabs wounded.

==Events==

On the night of 30 April 1921, the Jewish Communist Party (precursor of the Palestine Communist Party) distributed Arabic, Hebrew, and Yiddish fliers calling for the toppling of British rule and the establishment of a &quot;Soviet Palestine.&quot; The party announced its intention to parade from Jaffa to neighbouring Tel Aviv to commemorate May Day. On the morning of the parade, despite a warning to the 60 members present from one of Jaffa&#x27;s most senior police officers, Toufiq Bey al-Said, who visited the party&#x27;s headquarters, the march headed from Jaffa to Tel Aviv through the mixed Jewish–Arab border neighbourhood of Manshiyya.

Another large May Day parade had also been organized for Tel Aviv by the rival socialist Ahdut HaAvoda group, with official authorization. When the two processions met, a fistfight erupted. Police attempted to disperse the about 50 communist protestors. A general disturbance quickly ensued and spread to the southern part of town.

Dozens of British, Arab, and Jewish witnesses all reported that Arab men bearing clubs, knives, swords, and some pistols broke into Jewish buildings and murdered their inhabitants, while women followed to loot. They attacked Jewish pedestrians and destroyed Jewish homes and stores. They beat and killed Jews in their homes, including children, and in some cases split open the victims&#x27; skulls.

At 1:30 pm, an immigrant hostel run by the Zionist Commission and home to a hundred people who had arrived in recent weeks and days was attacked by the mob, and though the residents tried to barricade the gate, it was rammed open and Arabs attackers poured in. The stone-throwing was followed by bombs and gunfire, and the Jewish hostel residents hid in various rooms. When the police arrived, it was reported that they weren&#x27;t shooting to disperse the crowd, but were actually aiming at the building. In the courtyard one immigrant was felled by a policeman&#x27;s bullet at short-range, and others were stabbed and beaten with sticks. Five women fled a policeman firing his pistol; three escaped. A policeman cornered two women and tried to rape them, but they escaped him despite his shooting at them. A fourteen-year-old girl and some men managed to escape the building, but each was in turn chased down and beaten to death with iron rods or wooden boards. 

The violence reached as far as Abu Kabir. The Jewish Yitzker family owned a dairy farm on the outskirts of the neighbourhood, in which they rented out rooms. At the time of the riots, Yosef Haim Brenner, one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew literature was living at the site. On May 2, 1921, despite warnings Yitzker and Brenner refused to leave the farm and were murdered, along with Yitzker&#x27;s teenaged son, his son-in-law and two other renters.

As in the previous year&#x27;s Nebi Musa riots, the mob tore open their victims&#x27; quilts and pillows, sending up clouds of feathers. Some Arabs defended Jews and offered them refuge in their homes; many witnesses identified their attackers and murderers as their neighbours. Several witnesses said that Arab policemen had participated.

On May 2, Jews in the Haganah began launching reprisal attacks on Arabs – the first of their kind. Armed with automatic weapons, at least one group of Haganah militants broke into Arab homes with instructions to &quot;destroy everything, sparing only small children.&quot; Their commander who gave the order reported &quot;good results&quot; in response to his instructions. The chief force behind the creation of the Haganah, Eliyahu Golomb, reported that at least one of the group&#x27;s militants had killed a disabled Arab and his children in an orange grove. Several Jews were arrested, including one policeman, for their suspected involvement in the shooting of Arab civilians, but were not charged due to lack of evidence. Haganah archives indicate, however, there was a &quot;grain of truth&quot; to the charges. Of the 48 Arab dead, mostly killed by the British police force, it was unclear how many were killed in revenge attacks by Jews.

High Commissioner Herbert Samuel declared a state of emergency, imposed press censorship, and called for reinforcements from Egypt. General Allenby sent two destroyers to Jaffa and one to Haifa. Samuel met with and tried to calm Arab representatives. Musa Kazim al-Husseini, who had been dismissed as Jerusalem&#x27;s mayor on account of his involvement in the previous year&#x27;s Nebi Musa riots, demanded a suspension of Jewish immigration. Samuel assented, and two or three small boats holding 300 Jews were refused permission to land, and were forced to return to Istanbul. At the same time, al-Husseini&#x27;s nephew, Amin al-Husseini, was appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, a decision that later faced much criticism.

An American architect of Russian Jewish origin, Peres Etkes, who worked for the Mandatory authorities, secretly transferred a stock of rifles from the British-run Jaffa armoury to supply Jewish forces in the riots. Fighting went on for several days and spread to nearby Rehovot, Kfar Saba, Petah Tikva, and Hadera. British aircraft dropped bombs &quot;to protect Jewish settlements from Arab raiders.&quot;

==Immediate aftermath==
The riot resulted in the deaths of 47 Jews and 48 Arabs. 146 Jews and 73 Arabs were wounded. Most Arab casualties resulted from clashes with British forces attempting to restore order. Thousands of Jewish residents of Jaffa fled for Tel Aviv and were temporarily housed in tent camps on the beach. Tel Aviv, which had been previously lobbying for independent status, became a separate city due in part to the riots. However Tel Aviv was still dependent on Jaffa, which supplied it with food, services, and was the place of employment for most residents of the new city.Jewish casualties would have been higher had it not been for a British officer, Major Lionel Mansell Jeune, whose actions in intervening are credited with saving some 100 Jewish immigrants.

The victims were buried at the Trumpeldor Cemetery, established in Jaffa in 1902. The newspaper HaTzfira reported that meetings across the country had been postponed, all parties and celebration had been cancelled and schools closed for four days. The newspapers on May 3 appeared with black borders.

The newspaper &quot;Kuntress&quot;, whose author and co-editor Yosef Haim Brenner was one of the victims of the riots, published an article entitled &quot;Entrenchment&quot;. The article expressed the view that the Jews&#x27; outstretched hand had been spurned but that they would only redouble their efforts to survive as a self-reliant community.

Some villages whose residents had participated in the violence were fined and a few rioters were brought to trial. When three Jews, including a policeman, were convicted of participating in the murder of Arabs, international outcry ensued. Although the Supreme Court ultimately acquitted them on grounds of self-defence, the incident served to continue the crisis of confidence between the Jewish community and the British administration. Three Arab men were tried for the murder of Brenner, but were acquitted due to reasonable doubt. Toufiq Bey al-Said, who resigned from the Jaffa police, was shot in the street; his assassin was dispatched by veterans of Hashomer in retribution for Brenner&#x27;s murder, though another Jewish man was wrongly accused and acquitted.

The Arab leaders submitted a petition to the League of Nations in which they expressed their demands for independence and democracy, noting that the Arab community contained sufficient educated and talented members to establish a stable representative democracy.

==Investigative commission==
High Commissioner Sir Herbert Samuel established an investigative commission headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Palestine, Sir Thomas Haycraft (see Haycraft Commission of Inquiry). Its report confirmed the participation of Arab policemen in the riots and found the actions taken by the authorities adequate. The report angered both Jews and Arabs: it placed the blame on the Arabs, but said that, &quot;Zionists were not doing enough to mitigate the Arabs&#x27; apprehensions.&quot; The report concluded that, &quot;the fundamental cause of the violence and the subsequent acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with, and hostility to, the Jews, due to political and economic causes, and connected with Jewish immigration.&quot; .

The report included an Appendix summarising the findings as follows.
* The fundamental cause of the Jaffa riots and the subsequent acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with, and hostility to, the Jews, due to political and economic causes, and connected with Jewish immigration, and with their conception of Zionist policy as derived from Jewish exponents.
* The immediate cause of the Jaffa riots on the 1st May was an unauthorised demonstration of Bolshevik Jews, followed by its clash with an authorised demonstration of the Jewish Labour Party.
* The racial strife was begun by Arabs, and rapidly developed into a conflict of great violence between Arabs and Jews, in which the Arab majority, who were generally the aggressors, inflicted most of the casualties.
* The outbreak was not premeditated or expected, nor was either side prepared for it ; but the state of popular feeling made a conflict likely to occur on any provocation by any Jews.
* The general body of Jews is opposed to Bolshevism, and was not responsible for the Bolshevik demonstration.·
* When the disturbance had once begun an already acute anti-Jewish feeling extended it into an anti-Jewish riot. A large part of the Muslim and Christian communities condoned it, although they did not encourage violence. While certain of the educated Arabs appear to have incited the mob, the notables on both sides, whatever their feelings may have been, aided the authorities to allay the trouble.
* The police were, with few exceptions, half-trained and inefficient, in many cases indifferent, and in some cases leaders of or participators in violence.
* The conduct of the military was admirable throughout.
* The raids on five Jewish agricultural colonies arose from the excitement produced in the minds of the Arabs by reports of Arabs having been killed by Jews in Jaffa. In two cases unfounded stories of provocation were believed and acted upon without any effort being made to verify them.
* In these raids there were few Jewish and many Arab casualties, chiefly on account of the intervention of the military.
* This résumé is necessarily too condensed to be regarded as the expression of the conclusions of the Commission, except when read in conjunction with the report.

==Consequences==
In a speech in June 1921 on the occasion of the Royal birthday, Samuel stressing Britain&#x27;s commitment to the second part of the Balfour Declaration, declared that Jewish immigration would be allowed only to the extent that it did not burden the economy. Those who heard the speech had the impression that he was trying to appease the Arabs at the Jews&#x27; expense, and some Jewish leaders boycotted him for a time.

The Palestine government imposed fines on Arab villages and tribes believed to have been collectively involved in the riot. They were Tulkarm, Kakon, Kalkilieh, Kafr Saba, the Wadi Hawareth Bedouin and the Abu Kishik tribe.

New bloody riots broke out in Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem on November 2, 1921, when five Jewish residents and three of their Arab attackers were killed, which led to calls for the resignation of the city&#x27;s commissioner, Sir Ronald Storrs.

<doc id="434537" wikidata="Q1190590" url="?curid=434537" title="Encino, Los Angeles">
<text>Encino is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.

== Etymology ==
The name Encino is the misspelling in masculine of Encina, the Spanish word for &quot;holm oak” (Quercus ilex). The Spanish name reflects the original Tongva-language name for the village of Siutcanga, which can be translated to &quot;the place of the oaks.&quot;

==History==
In 1769, the Spanish Portolá expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of California, traveled north through Sepulveda Pass into the San Fernando Valley on August 5 and stayed two nights at the Tongva village of Siutcanga (&quot;the place of the oaks&quot;) near what is now Los Encinos State Historic Park. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary traveling with the expedition, named the valley &quot;El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bolonia de Los Encinos&quot; (The Valley of St. Catherine of Bologna of the Oaks). All of Crespi&#x27;s name was later dropped except &quot;Encino&quot;.

Rancho Los Encinos (&quot;Ranch of Holm Oaks&quot;) was established in 1845 when a large parcel of former Mission San Fernando land was granted to three Mission Indians by governor Pio Pico. Many ranchos were created after the secularization of the California missions, which began in 1834. Encino derives its name from the rancho.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 41,905 residents in the Encino neighborhood — , among the lowest population densities for the city but average for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 44,581.

In 2000, the median age for residents was 42, considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percentages of residents aged 50 and older were among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood demographic breakdown was Whites, 80.1%; Latinos, 8.5%; Asians, 4.9%; Blacks, 2.4%; and others, 4.1%.

Iran (30.1%) and Russia (6.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 32.8% of the residents who were born abroad—an average percentage for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $78,529, considered high for the city. The percentage of households that earned $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 2.3 people was low when compared to the rest of the city and the county. Renters occupied 38.4% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 61.6%.

The percentages of divorced residents and of widowed men and women were among the county&#x27;s highest. In 2000 military veterans amounted to 10.6% of the population, a high rate for the county.

==Geography==

Encino is situated in the central portion of the southern San Fernando Valley and on the north slope of the Santa Monica Mountains. It is flanked on the north by Reseda, Lake Balboa, and the Sepulveda Basin, on the east by Sherman Oaks, on the south by Brentwood, and on the west by Tarzana.

===Climate===
==Economy==
The local economy provides jobs primarily in health care (including one of two Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center hospitals), social services, and professional services (accounting and financial services, real estate, and legal) sectors. There are approximately 3,800 businesses employing about 27,000 people at an annual payroll of $1.4 billion.

==Government and infrastructure==
Encino is in Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors district 3 and Los Angeles City Council District 4. It is also represented within the city of Los Angeles by the Encino Neighborhood Council, an advisory body.

The United States Postal Service operates the Encino Post Office at 5805 White Oak Avenue and the Balboa Van Nuys Post Office at 4930 Balboa Boulevard.

==Transportation==
Balboa Station is located at 6338 Balboa Avenue on the Metro G Line.

The Encino Park and Ride with 160 spaces is located at 5174 Hayvenhurst Avenue, which provides weekday connections to/from Downtown Los Angeles, LAX, Pasadena, Thousand Oaks and other locations via various LADOT commuter buses.

==Education==
By 2000, forty-six percent of Encino residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree, a high percentage for both the city and the county. The percentage of those residents with a master&#x27;s degree or higher was also high for the county.

==Notable attractions==

The Encino Velodrome has provided an outdoor oval bicycle racing track since 1961.

Los Encinos State Historic Park features historic buildings, a small museum, and picnic grounds. In 2009 it faced closure due to California&#x27;s budget crisis. The Park remains open today.

The Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is a large area with multiple golf courses, tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, bike paths, and a lake bordered by about 2,000 Pink Cloud cherry trees that blossom in the spring. Encino Park was founded around 1937 and has a playground, as well as basketball courts and two lighted tennis courts.

For over a millennium, the area known as Encino was the home of a massive California live oak known as the Encino Oak Tree. It is possible that Encino is named because of this particular tree. (&quot;Encino&quot; is the Spanish word for &quot;evergreen&quot; or &quot;holm oak.&quot;) It was known for its size and longevity. The tree died on February 7, 1998, after an El Niño storm felled it. Today there is a monument to the tree at the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Louise Avenue where the Encino Oak once stood.

<text>The East–West Line (EWL) is a high-capacity Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line operated by SMRT in Singapore, running from Pasir Ris station in the east to Tuas Link station in the west, with an additional branch between Changi Airport and Tanah Merah stations. It is the second Mass Rapid Transit line to be built in Singapore. Coloured green on the rail map, the line serves 35 stations, 8 of which (from Lavender to Tiong Bahru and Changi Airport stations) are underground. At , the line is the longest on the MRT network. 

Constructed and opened as part of the North–South Line (NSL) in the early stages of development, the East–West Line was the second rail line formed in Singapore after NSL, with the opening of the eastern extension to Tanah Merah on the EWL in 1989. Nevertheless, both lines use identical signalling equipment and rolling stock. The East–West Line signalling systems have been upgraded along with the North–South Line, with both MRT lines having its signalling fully upgraded, converting it from semi-automatic to fully automatic.

==History==
=== Initial developments ===
The first segment of what would become the East–West Line, between City Hall and Outram Park stations, was opened on 12 December 1987 as part of the North–South Line and Phase 1 of the initial system. Subsequently, it was extended westwards to Clementi station on 12 March 1988 and to Lakeside on 5 November 1988. 

The eastern extension to Tanah Merah station opened on 4 November 1989, which also marked the start of independent operations as the East–West Line. The opening ceremony was attended by then First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.

The line extension to Pasir Ris station was opened ahead of schedule on 16 December 1989 with a sneak preview beforehand. Boon Lay station opened on 6 July 1990, marking the completion of the initial MRT system.

===Subsequent developments===
====Dover station====
Construction on a new infill station located between Buona Vista station and Clementi station, namely Dover station, began in June 1998. It is the first station in the MRT network to be built as an infill station. The building of the station was met with reservations by some members of the public over the small area it serviced and there were criticisms over the spending of &quot;taxpayers&#x27; money&quot; chiefly for use only by students of one educational institution. Despite some opposition, the Land Transport Authority proceeded with the construction to serve commuters along Singapore Polytechnic with Dover housing estate. The station opened on 18 October 2001. Prior to opening, test runs were conducted from 13 to 17 October 2001 when the trains stopped at the station but did not open their doors.

====Tanah Merah to Airport extension line====
The idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 of the airport was being built. Earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing East–West Line at Tanah Merah, with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the eastern coasts. The plans were finally announced by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 15 November 1996. However, the new route alignment showed a deviation from previous plans, where the final plan involved in building only the first two stations of Expo, and Changi Airport, the latter being the underground station built between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. The alignment of the station at the airport also switched perpendicularly to an east–west direction, such that the station leads to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station. The station&#x27;s designs were unveiled on 10 February 1998 with construction starting on 29 January 1999. Expo and Changi Airport were opened on 10 January 2001 and 8 February 2002 respectively and operates under a shuttle service. Prior to 22 July 2003, train services from Boon Lay commences after the opening, but were later reverted to shuttle services due to low patronage. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the Changi Airport Extension will be converted to become part of Thomson-East Coast line Extension (TELe) by 2040.

====Boon Lay and Tuas extension====

The Boon Lay extension was first announced by the LTA on 29 December 2004, set to serve residents from the Jurong West Town area and those working in the Jurong Industrial Estate. The two stations, Pioneer and Joo Koon stations, officially opened on 28 February 2009.

On 11 January 2011, the Tuas West extension, an extension of the East–West Line from Joo Koon to Tuas Link was announced. The extension has a span of , which spans a twin-tracked MRT viaduct, four above-ground stations and a depot to provide stabling and maintenance facilities for the additional trains that will be bought for the extension and to cater for future expansion of the line. The viaduct is integrated with part of a road viaduct along Pioneer Road, which will increase the road capacity to cope with anticipated increase in traffic. The stations are Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent, Tuas West Road, and Tuas Link. On 4 May 2012, the Land Transport Authority marked the start of construction of the Tuas West extension with a groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the future Tuas Link station.

The extension began service on 18 June 2017. During initial stages after opening, the westbound trains will alternate their terminus between Joo Koon and Tuas Link, where for every two trains, one train will terminate at the former, while the other train will terminate at the latter.

===Additional platform at Tanah Merah station===
On 25 August 2014, the Land Transport Authority announced that a new platform will be constructed at Tanah Merah, enabling faster travel and shorter waiting times for commuters heading towards Expo and Changi Airport on the Changi Airport branch line of the East–West Line.

On 26 October 2016, the Land Transport Authority awarded the civil contract to Lum Chang Building Contractors Pte. Ltd. to build a new platform at Tanah Merah and viaducts for a contract sum of S$325 million. In addition to the new platforms, the existing East–West Line tracks will be extended to connect the line to the new four-in-one East Coast Integrated Depot at Changi. When completed in 2024, it will be the second station to have triple island platforms after Jurong East.

===Half-height platform screen door installations===
There were calls for platform screen doors (PSDs) to be installed at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed or seriously injured by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above-ground stations. Underground stations already featured the doors since 1987. The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs, but made an about-turn later with the government announcing plans to install half-height platform screen doors on the elevated stations on 25 January 2008, citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide. They were first installed at Jurong East, Pasir Ris, and Yishun stations in 2009 as trial runs. On 31 August 2011, the LTA announced completion of the installation of PSDs along the East–West Line, with Expo being the last station on the line to receive the PSDs. Installation of PSDs across both the North–South and East–West lines (NSEWL) were completed on 14 March 2012, 3 months ahead of schedule.

==Improvement works==
===Timber to concrete sleeper replacement works===
The timber sleepers on the East–West Line was required to be replaced as they were near the end of their 25-year lifespan. The replacement sleepers, made of concrete, have a significantly longer lifespan. To speed up works, train services on the East–West Line was adjusted to end earlier. The work was divided into three phases: Phase 1 (Bugis – Tanah Merah), Phase 2 (Joo Koon – Jurong East, Tanah Merah – Pasir Ris) and Phase 3 (Jurong East – Outram Park). The sleepers were fully replaced on 18 February 2017.

===Re-signalling works===
A new moving-block signalling system, supplied by Thales, replaced the former ageing fixed-block signalling system on the East–West Line. The new signalling system, costing $195 million, reduces waiting times for trains during peak periods from 120 seconds then to 100 seconds now. The new system became operational between Pioneer and Tuas Link stations on 18 June 2017. Newer rolling stocks, such as the C151B and C151C, are equipped for use solely on the new signalling system. Since 27 May 2018, the new signalling system has been operating full-day on the entire East–West Line.

===Third-rail replacement===
Replacement works on the third rail, which provides electricity to the trains, were carried out between September 2015 and August 2017. The new third rail replaced its 30-year-old predecessor and is expected to increase reliability of the East–West line&#x27;s electrical system.

=== Pasir Ris turnback extension ===
A new railway turnback located at Pasir Ris station, the eastern terminus of the line, was announced by the Land Transport Authority on 29 Jun 2018. It would extend the railway viaduct past the station by . The turnback will allow for an increase in service frequency during peak times from 30 to 36 trains per hour as trains will be able to change directions faster to head westwards on the line, to meet future increases in ridership demand. Construction started in 2019 and was completed in May 2024.

==Incidents==
===1993 Clementi train collision===

On 5 August 1993, before opening, a maintenance vehicle spilt oil on the tracks between Clementi and Jurong East. The first ten eastbound trains reported braking problems, then the eleventh train from Jurong stopped at the Clementi station for two minutes longer than scheduled due to it using its emergency brakes to stop at the station at 7.50 am, before being hit by another eastbound train when it failed to stop in time. 156 passengers were injured by the collision.

===7 July 2015 power trip===
During the evening peak hours on 7 July 2015, train services on the East–West and North–South Lines were temporarily disrupted due to massive power trips detected along both lines. The cause of the disruption was due to damaged insulators which had resulted in the failure of the power supply. For this disruption that brought inconvenience to 413,000 commuters, LTA imposed a &#x27;record&#x27; fine of S$5.4 million on SMRT.

===22 March 2016 staff fatalities===

At about 11:08 a.m. on 22 March 2016, two SMRT track-maintenance trainee staff were run over and killed by a C151 train approaching Pasir Ris station, resulting in a temporarily service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris for over two hours that affected at least 10,000 commuters.

The two trainee staff had joined SMRT in January 2016 and worked as technicians under a technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were tasked to go down to the tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by the station. An operator cited that they were granted access to the tracks, but did not coordinate with a Signal Unit in the station to ensure trains could not travel in the area where the team was.

Patrick Nathan, SMRT vice-president, promised that &quot;SMRT will review all safety protocols particularly those involving track access&quot;. SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek apologised for the incident and said SMRT will investigate how &quot;the [two men] got hit by the train&quot;. SMRT fired both an engineer responsible for leading with the team and the train driver who was involved at the scene of the incident.

The engineer who led the inspection team was charged with negligence causing death under the Penal Code and was subsequently sentenced to 4 weeks in jail. SMRT Trains and one member of SMRT management were charged for violating the Workplace Safety and Health Act for lapses which led to the accident, and were fined $400,000 respectively. and $55,000. On 20 July 2018, the Land Transport Authority fined the operator S$1.9 million (US$ million) for this incident and the Bishan tunnel flooding.

===15 November 2017 train collision and disruptions===

A second train collision occurred on 15 November 2017 at approximately 8.18am, where two C151A trains collided at Joo Koon MRT station. A train fault caused the first train heading in the direction of Tuas Link to stall at the station. A minute later, a second train stopped behind the first and then &quot;moved forward unexpectedly,&quot; hitting the other train. Thirty-eight people, including two SMRT staff, were hospitalized.

Train services between Tuas Link and Joo Koon stations were temporally suspended in both directions for two hours on the day itself and the entire day on 16 November 2017, and westbound trains temporarily terminated at Joo Koon.

An update by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) &amp; SMRT on 16 November 2017 stated that LTA and SMRT had decided to isolate for up to one month the operations of the Tuas West extension, which runs on the new signalling system, from the rest of the East–West Line, which runs on the old signalling system, enabling LTA engineers to carry out further assurance checks together with Thales. The train was switching systems when the collision took place. Train service on the line resumed on 20 November, with the Tuas West extension between Gul Circle and Tuas Link using the new signalling system and the section between Pasir Ris and Joo Koon, together with the Changi Airport Branch continuing to run on the old signalling system. Train services between Joo Koon and Gul Circle were temporarily suspended until its resumption on 28 May 2018; between the suspension a free bridging bus service is available between the two stations. Continuous service between Pasir Ris and Gul Circle resumed on 28 May 2018, with the permanent activation of the new CBTC system; since the incident, selected portions of either the North–South Line or East–West Line were closed to conduct track renewal works with early weekend closures and later station openings.

=== 25-30 September 2024 train derailment and disruptions ===
Train services between Boon Lay and Queenstown had been suspended since 9am on 25 September 2024 after trains lost power on a stretch near Clementi MRT station. A defective train axle box on one of the first generation C151 trains, which had been deadheading to Ulu Pandan Depot after it was withdrawn at Clementi station, dropped onto the tracks near Dover station and caused the wheels of a bogie - an undercarriage - to come off the running rail and hit track equipment, including stretches of the third rail, 3 point machines as well as power cables and rail clips. In an update at about 9:30pm on 25 September 2024, LTA and SMRT announced that train services between Buona Vista and Jurong East would remain suspended on 26 September 2024, the 1st day of the PSLE exams, while service between Boon Lay and Jurong East, and Queenstown and Buona Vista, would each run their own separate shuttle services every 10 minutes. On Thursday night, SMRT announced that no trains will run between Jurong East and Buona Vista for a third straight day, with full service expected to resume the following Monday. However, in an update at about 4:30pm on 29 September 2024, the target date for restoration of full service was pushed back to Tuesday. On September 30, SMRT and LTA announced that full service would fully resume on October 1, with westbound train speeds being reduced from the usual 60-80 kilometres per hour (37.5-50mph) to 40 kilometres per hour (25mph) until October 3, as part of a standard process after rail replacements. 

==Network and operations==
Train services on the East–West Line operates from approximately 5:30am to around midnight daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 2 to 3 minutes while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 5 minutes throughout the entire route.

The first train departs from these places:

Train services on the East–West Line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. Shuttle bus services may be provided throughout the duration of the early closures and late openings for affected commuters. Operations of the East–West Line are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the drop of ridership.

===Route===

As its name implies, the East–West Line connects central Singapore to both eastern and western parts of the island, with an additional branch between Changi Airport and Tanah Merah, which operates as a separate shuttle service. It is 57.2 kilometers (35.5 miles) long and it is predominantly double-tracked, but certain short sections at Tanah Merah, Outram Park and Joo Koon widens to three tracks, four tracks nearby Jurong East station and a section between Jurong East and Clementi station and five tracks nearby Changi Depot and Tanah Merah station. 

Some stations are commonly placed at the middle of the roads such as Tanah Merah, Bedok, Queenstown, Commonwealth, Dover, Clementi, Pioneer, Joo Koon, Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent and Tuas West Road. The line runs mostly on overhead viaducts but goes underground in the city area between Kallang and Redhill, Bedok and Kembangan, and between Expo and Changi Airport. Travelling from one end of the line to the other takes about 85 minutes.

The line begins above ground at Pasir Ris station from where it continues to head south towards Simei station. The line curves between Simei to Tanah Merah stations and continues westwards, joining the Changi Airport branch, paralleling New Upper Changi Road. Two branch lines to Changi Depot and to Changi Airport station exists between Simei and Tanah Merah stations. At Tanah Merah station, the line extends to four tracks due to its interchange with the Changi branch before turning back into two tracks in a western direction.

From Bedok station to Kembangan station, the line goes underground but then goes above-ground, and follows the route of Sims Avenue and Sims Avenue East in an opposite direction. After Kallang station, the line goes underground through the Central Area and runs heads south-west towards City Hall station. It then runs parallel to the North–South Line between City Hall and Raffles Place stations, which are cross-platform interchanges to the North–South Line. After Tanjong Pagar, the line curves northwestwards towards Outram Park. After Tiong Bahru, the line continues above ground starting with Redhill station and follows the direction of Commonwealth Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue West and Boon Lay Way. Between Clementi and Jurong East station, three branches (one going east and two going west) to Ulu Pandan Depot are deployed. At Jurong East station, the line extends again to four tracks due to its interchange with the North-South line but then, separates into two before heading west to Chinese Garden station. After Pioneer station, the line heads south-west before curving westwards towards Joo Koon station. The line terminates at Tuas Link with a branch heading towards Tuas Depot.

The Changi Airport extension starts at Tanah Merah station as a single track before turning eastwards to Expo station. After Expo station, it goes underground and curves south before terminating at Changi Airport station.

The East–West Line was constructed along the North–South Line. As such, both lines used identical signalling equipment and rolling stock.

===Stations===
The line serves 35 stations across of track, and station codes for the line are green, corresponding to the line&#x27;s colour on the system map. 8 stations, including Changi Airport, and 7 other stations on the stretch from Lavender to Tiong Bahru are underground, with the rest being elevated. With the exception of Dover, all stations have island platforms.

Legend

List

SMRT used to operate the branch sector of Tanah Merah to Changi Airport as a through service from Boon Lay from 18 November 2001 until 22 July 2003, when it was replaced with a shuttle service. By 2040, the Changi Airport line (CAL) will be converted to the Thomson-East Coast line.

===Depots===
==Infrastructure==
===Rolling stock===
Five batches of rolling stock operate on the East–West Line, namely the C151, C151A, C151B, C151C and R151 from oldest to newest, shared with the North–South Line. Trains are maintained at Changi Depot, Ulu Pandan Depot and Tuas Depot, which provide train maintenance, inspection and overhaul facilities. These models of rolling stock were introduced to boost the capacity on both the North–South and the East–West lines in order to cope with increasing ridership.

Both the North–South and the East–West lines utilized identical rolling stock up until the 2010s, when the C151A trains were temporary suspended from operating on the North–South Line from January 2012 until November 2013 following the 2011 train disruptions. The C151B trains, which were introduced in April 2017, did not begin revenue service on the full stretch of the East–West Line until the line&#x27;s trial of the CBTC signalling system in May 2018. The C151C trains, despite their introduction on 30 September 2018 on the North–South Line, only made their full day debut on the East–West Line on 4 November 2023.

Another generation of rolling stock, the R151 trains, will be delivered from 2022 to 2026, to replace all 66 first-generation C151 trains which will be retired by 2025, as well as all 19 second-generation C651 and 21 third-generation C751B trains which were fully phased out by 2024. The R151 trains are the first rolling stock on the East–West Line to be manufactured by Bombardier (Bought by Alstom in 2021), which has also supplied trains for the Downtown Line. The first train entered service on the East–West Line on 4 June 2023.

=== Signalling ===

The East–West Line is equipped with Thales SelTrac communications-based train control (CBTC) moving block signalling system with automatic train control (ATC) under automatic train operation (ATO) Grades of Automation (GoA) 3. The subsystems consist of automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, NetTrac MT Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and a computer-based interlocking (CBI) system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.

The old signalling system has undergone decommissioning work from August 2018 and was completed on 23 November 2018. It consists of Westinghouse fixed block signalling system with Automatic train control (ATC) under Automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 2. The subsystems consist of Automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and a Relay interlocking system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.

The stretch of track between Pioneer and Tuas Link stations was equipped with the new signalling system which came into use in June 2017. As the section of track between Pioneer and Joo Koon support &#x27;mixed-mode&#x27; of both signalling systems, trains terminating at either Joo Koon or Tuas Link would have to change signalling modes at Pioneer MRT station as trains terminating at Joo Koon would proceed to a turn back siding which was built as part of the TWE which only supports the new signalling system. Eastbound trains towards Pasir Ris would have to change back to the old signalling system at Pioneer MRT station. This procedure was removed after the train collision at Joo Koon as trains terminated at Joo Koon. The new signalling system became fully operational on 28 May 2018.

=== Platform screen doors ===
When the line was first opened, full-height platform screen doors supplied by Westinghouse were installed at underground stations. These doors serve to prevent suicides, enable climate control within the station, better security control by restricting access to the tunnels and tracks and for overall passenger safety considerations. The authorities initially rejected calls for platform screen doors to be installed at elevated stations by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs. Nevertheless, the LTA reversed its decision and made plans to install half-height platform screen doors on elevated stations on 25 January 2008. The first platform screen doors by ST Electronics were installed at Pasir Ris, Jurong East and Yishun stations in 2009 as trial runs. Subsequently, installation began in May 2011 at Ang Mo Kio station on the North–South Line. On 14 March 2012, platform screen doors became operational at all elevated stations on the East–West Line. Stations along the TWE had half-height platform screen doors manufactured by Fangda installed during the station&#x27;s construction.

<text>Marquess Townshend is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain held by the Townshend family of Raynham Hall in Norfolk. The title was created in 1787 for George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend.

==History==
The Townshend family descends from Roger Townshend, who in 1617 was created a baronet, of Raynham in the County of Norfolk, in the Baronetage of England. He later represented Orford and Norfolk in the House of Commons. His younger son, the third Baronet (who succeeded his elder brother), played an important role in the restoration of the monarchy after the Civil War and was also Member of Parliament for Norfolk. In 1661 he was created Baron Townshend, of Lynn Regis in the County of Norfolk, and in 1682 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Townshend, of Raynham in the County of Norfolk. Both titles were in the Peerage of England.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department from 1714 to 1716 and from 1721 to 1730. Lord Townshend is also remembered for the agricultural reforms he undertook at his Norfolk estate and gained the nickname &quot;Turnip Townshend&quot;. His eldest son, the third Viscount, briefly represented Great Yarmouth in the House of Commons. However, in 1723, during his father&#x27;s lifetime, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Townshend (although he was styled &quot;Lord Lynn&quot;, taken from the territorial designation of the barony, to distinguish him from his father). Lord Townshend later served as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Viscount. He was a Field Marshal in the Army and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as Master-General of the Ordnance. In 1787 he was created Marquess Townshend in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Townshend married as his first wife Charlotte Compton, 16th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley and 7th Baroness Compton. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Marquess. He had already on his mother&#x27;s death in 1770 succeeded in the baronies Ferrers of Chartley and Compton. In 1784, 23 years before he succeeded his father, he was created Earl of Leicester in the Peerage of Great Britain. His choice of title derived from his descent from Lady Lucy Sydney, daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (a title which had become extinct in 1743). Lord Townshend later held office as Master of the Mint, as Joint Postmaster General and as Lord Steward of the Household.

His son, the third Marquess, was childless. On his death in 1855 the earldom of Leicester became extinct while the baronies of Ferrers of Chartley and Compton fell into abeyance. He was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin, the fourth Marquess. He was the son of Lord John Townshend, second son of the first Marquess. Lord Townshend was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Tamworth. His son, the fifth Marquess, also represented Tamworth in Parliament (as a Liberal). the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the eighth Marquess, who succeeded his father in April 2010.

Several other members of the Townshend family have also gained distinction. Charles Townshend, second son of the third Viscount, was a prominent statesman and orator and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1766 to 1767. The politician Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, after whom the town of Sydney, Australia, was named, was the son of the Hon. Thomas Townshend, second son of the second Viscount. Sydney&#x27;s grandson was the Liberal politician John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney. Charles Townshend, 1st Baron Bayning, was the son of the Hon. William Townshend, third son of the second Viscount. See also Roger Townshend, Admiral George Townshend, Lord Charles Townshend, Lord John Townshend, Lord Charles Townshend, Lord James Townshend, Charles Fox Townshend and Major-General Sir Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend.

As Lord Townshend holds no titles with names different from his main title, the territorial designation from his viscountcy is used for his heir, who is styled &quot;Viscount Raynham&quot;. Between 1807 and 1855 the courtesy title was &quot;Earl of Leicester&quot; (although the title was not used from 1811 to 1855 as there was no a real heir apparent to the marquessate during this period, but earldom &quot;usurped&quot; by John Dunn-Gardner in 1823–1843), while from 1782 to 1855 the courtesy title used by the heir apparent to the earldom of Leicester was &quot;Lord Ferrers of Chartley&quot; (and consequently was not used from 1811 to 1855 as there was no a real heir apparent either to the earldom or marquessate).

The current Marquess holds the subsidiary titles: Viscount Townshend, of Raynham in the County of Norfolk (created 1682); Baron Townshend, of Lynn Regis in the County of Norfolk (created 1661); Townshend Baronet, &#x27;of Raynham in the County of Norfolk&#x27; (created 1617), all of which in the Peerage of England. As noted above, due to being of the same name as the primary title, the Viscountcy has been called &quot;Viscount Raynham&quot; and the Barony &quot;Baron Lynn&quot;.

The family seat is Raynham Hall, Fakenham, Norfolk.

<doc id="434542" wikidata="Q339114" url="?curid=434542" title="Accident (1967 film)">
<text>Accident is a 1967 British drama film directed by Joseph Losey. Written by Harold Pinter, it is an adaptation of the 1965 novel &quot;Accident&quot; by Nicholas Mosley. It is the second of three Losey–Pinter collaborations; the others being &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971). At the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Accident&quot; won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury award. It also won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

==Plot==
Stephen, a married Oxford tutor in his forties, has two students: the rich and likeable William, of whom he is fond, and a beautiful, enigmatic Austrian named Anna, whom he secretly covets. William also fancies Anna and hopes to know her better. While his wife is away having their third child, Stephen looks up an old flame in London and they sleep together. Returning home, he finds that his pushy colleague Charley has been using the house for sex with Anna. She tells Stephen privately that she and William are engaged to be married.

William says that he will come to Stephen&#x27;s house after a party that night. As he is too drunk to drive, Anna takes the wheel, but she crashes the car outside Stephen&#x27;s gate. Upon finding the accident and William dead, Stephen pulls the deeply shaken Anna from the wreckage and hides her upstairs while he calls the police. Later, he forces himself on her while she is still in shock, then takes her back to her room at the university. He comes by in the morning to find a bemused Charley, who cannot prevent Anna from packing to return to Austria.

==Cast==
* Dirk Bogarde as Stephen
* Stanley Baker as Charley
* Jacqueline Sassard as Anna
* Michael York as William
* Vivien Merchant as Rosalind, Stephen&#x27;s wife
* Alexander Knox as University Provost
* Delphine Seyrig as Francesca, daughter of the provost

* Freddie Jones as Man in Bell&#x27;s office
* Maxwell Caulfield (credited as Maxwell Findlater) as Ted

* Nicholas Mosley as Hedges
* Steven Easton as Baby, Stephen and Rosalind&#x27;s baby
===Cast notes===
Losey makes a cameo appearance in the film, and Pinter has a brief speaking role as the television producer, Mr. Bell.

==Reception==
In his review upon the film&#x27;s release, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther called &quot;Accident&quot; &quot;a sad little story of a wistful don ... neither strong drama nor stinging satire.&quot;

Responding to criticism that the film&#x27;s meaning was difficult to discern, Stanley Baker said: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious what &quot;Accident&quot; meant ... It meant what was shown on the screen.&quot; Of Joseph Losey&#x27;s direction, Baker said: &quot;One of Joe&#x27;s problems is that he tends to wrap things up too much for himself. I think that 75% of the audience didn&#x27;t realise that &quot;Accident&quot; was a flashback.&quot;

The film performed poorly at the box office. In 1973, Losey said the film was &quot;officially in bankruptcy.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Accident&quot; holds a rating of 76% from 29 reviews.

==Retrospective appraisal==
Perhaps the most celebrated sequence in the movie, comprising 25 minutes of the 105 minute film, is set at Stephen and Rosiland&#x27;s home on a Sunday afternoon. Anna and William are the invited guests, but Charley intrudes on the company unexpectedly. A tennis doubles tennis match is arranged—Stephen and Charley vs. William and Anna—in which Losey reveals, cinematically, the undercurrents of sexual tension among the three men. Film critic Robert Maris writes:
Film critics James Palmer and Michael Riley cite the dialogue from the &quot;deceptively casual, languid scene on the lawn&quot; which follows the tennis match, serving as &quot;a paradigm of reflexive storytelling.&quot;

Charley, Stephen&#x27;s academic colleague, challenges literature student William to create a omniscient narrative for characters in a novel, based on those attending the gathering:

Film critic Dan Callahan at &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; registers this assessment of Losey&#x27;s second film collaboration with playwright Harold Pinter:

<doc id="434543" wikidata="Q209245" url="?curid=434543" title="Tephra">
<text>Tephra is fragmental material produced by a volcanic eruption regardless of composition, fragment size, or emplacement mechanism.
Volcanologists also refer to airborne fragments as pyroclasts. Once clasts have fallen to the ground, they remain as tephra unless hot enough to fuse into pyroclastic rock or tuff. When a volcano explodes, it releases a variety of tephra including ash, cinders, and blocks. These layers settle on the land and, over time, sedimentation occurs incorporating these tephra layers into the geologic record.

Tephrochronology is a geochronological technique that uses discrete layers of tephra—volcanic ash from a single eruption—to create a chronological framework in which paleoenvironmental or archaeological records can be placed. Often, when a volcano explodes, biological organisms are killed and their remains are buried within the tephra layer. These fossils are later dated by scientists to determine the age of the fossil and its place within the geologic record.
==Overview==

Tephra is any sized or composition pyroclastic material produced by an explosive volcanic eruption and precise geological definitions exist. It consists of a variety of materials, typically glassy particles formed by the cooling of droplets of magma, which may be vesicular, solid or flake-like, and varying proportions of crystalline and mineral components originating from the mountain and the walls of the vent. As the particles fall to the ground, they are sorted to a certain extent by the wind and gravitational forces and form layers of unconsolidated material. The particles are further moved by ground surface or submarine water flow.

The distribution of tephra following an eruption usually involves the largest boulders falling to the ground quickest, therefore closest to the vent, while smaller fragments travel further – ash can often travel for thousands of miles, even circumglobal, as it can stay in the stratosphere for days to weeks following an eruption.
When large amounts of tephra accumulate in the atmosphere from massive volcanic eruptions (or from a multitude of smaller eruptions occurring simultaneously), they can reflect light and heat from the sun back through the atmosphere, in some cases causing the temperature to drop, resulting in a temporary &quot;volcanic winter&quot;. The effects of acidic rain and snow, the precipitation caused by tephra discharges into the atmosphere, can be seen for years after the eruptions have stopped. Tephra eruptions can affect ecosystems across millions of square kilometres or even entire continents depending on the size of the eruption.

==Classification==
Tephra fragments are classified by size:
* Ash – particles smaller than 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter
* Lapilli or volcanic cinders – between 2 and 64 mm (0.08 and 2.5 inches) in diameter
* Volcanic bombs or volcanic blocks – larger than 64 mm (2.5 inches) in diameter

The use of tephra layers, which bear their own unique chemistry and character, as temporal marker horizons in archaeological and geological sites, is known as tephrochronology.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tephra&quot; and &quot;pyroclast&quot; both derive from Greek: The word () means &quot;ash&quot;, while &quot;pyroclast&quot; is derived from the Greek (), meaning &quot;fire&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;broken in pieces&quot;. The word (means &quot;ashes&quot;) is used in broad context within an account by Aristotle of an eruption on Vulcano (Hiera) in &quot;Meteorologica&quot;.

== Environmental effects ==
The release of tephra into the troposphere affects the environment physically and chemically. Physically, volcanic blocks damage local flora and human settlements. Ash damages communication and electrical systems, coats forests and plant life, reducing photosynthesis, and pollutes groundwater. Tephra changes below- and above-ground air and water movement. Chemically, tephra release can affect the water cycle. Tephra particles can cause ice crystals to grow in clouds, which increases precipitation. Nearby watersheds and the ocean can experience elevated mineral levels, especially iron, which can cause explosive population growth in plankton communities. This, in turn, can result in eutrophication.

== Disciplines and fossil record ==
In addition to tephrochronology, tephra is used by a variety of scientific disciplines including geology, paleoecology, anthropology, and paleontology, to date fossils, identify dates within the fossils record, and learn about prehistoric cultures and ecosystems. For example, carbonatite tephra found at Oldoinyo Lengai (a volcano in the East African Rift Valley) has buried and preserved fossilized footprints of humans near the site of the eruption. Under certain conditions, volcanic blocks can be preserved for billions of years and can travel up to 400 km away from the eruption. Volcanic eruptions around the world have provided valuable scientific information on local ecosystems and ancient cultures.

==Volcanoes==

=== Africa ===
The Waw an Namus volcano is surrounded by an apron of dark tephra, which has a notable color contrast to the surrounding Sahara Desert.

Africa&#x27;s volcanoes have had an impact on the fossil record. Geographically a part of Africa, El Hierro is a shield volcano and the youngest and smallest of the Canary Islands. The most recent El Hierro eruption occurred underwater, in 2011, and caused earthquakes and landslides throughout the Canary Islands. Instead of ash, floating rocks, &#x27;restingolites&#x27; were released after every eruption. After the 2011 eruption, fossils of single-celled marine organisms were found in the restingolites verifying the origin theory that Canary Island growth comes from a single buoyant jet of magma from the Earth&#x27;s core instead of cracks in the ocean floor. This is reflected in the decreasing age of the islands east to west from Fuerteventura to El Hierro. 

There are about 60 volcanoes in Ethiopia, located in east Africa. In Southern Ethiopia, the Omo Kibish Rock Formation is composed of layers of tephra and sediment. Within these layers, several fossils have been discovered. In 1967, 2 &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossils were discovered in the Omo Kibish Formation by Richard Leaky, a paleoanthropologist. After radiocarbon dating, they were determined to be 195 thousand years old. Other mammals discovered in the formation include &quot;Hylochoerus meinertzhageni&quot; (forest hog) and &quot;Cephalophus&quot; (antelope).

=== Asia ===
In Asia, several volcanic eruptions are still influencing local cultures today. In North Korea, Paektu Mountain, a stratovolcano, first erupted in 946 AD and is a religious site for locals. It last erupted in 1903. In 2017, new fossil evidence was discovered that determined the date of Paektu Mountain&#x27;s first eruption, which had been a mystery. A team of scientists directed by Dr. Clive Oppenheimer, British volcanologist, discovered a larch trunk embedded within Paektu Mountain. After radiocarbon dating, the larch was determined to be 264 years old which coincides with the 946 AD eruption. Its tree rings are being studied and many new discoveries are being made about North Korea during that time.

In northeastern China, a large volcanic eruption in the early Cretaceous caused the fossilization of an entire ecosystem known as the Jehol Biota when powerful pyroclastic flows inundated the area. The deposits include many perfectly preserved fossils of dinosaurs, birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, frogs, plants, and insects.

=== Europe ===
Europe&#x27;s volcanoes provide unique information about the history of Italy. One example is Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano located in southern Italy, which last erupted in March 1944. Earlier, in 79 AD, in an eruption which lasted 12 to 18 hours, Vesuvius had covered the city of Pompeii in molten lava, ash, pumice, volcanic blocks, and toxic gases. Much of the town was preserved and organic materials fossilized by the volcanic ash, and that has provided valuable information about the Roman culture. Also, in Italy, Stromboli volcano, a stratovolcano, last erupted in July 2019.

=== North America ===

Several volcanic eruptions have been studied in North America. On 18 May 1980, Mount St. Helens, a stratovolcano in Washington state, erupted, spreading five hundred million tons of tephra ash across Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho causing earthquakes, rockslides, and megatsunami which severely altered the topography of nearby areas. In Yellowstone National Park, eruption-related flooding caused trees to collapse and wash into lake beds where they fossilized. Nearby forests were flooded, removing bark, leaves, and tree limbs. In 2006, the Augustine Volcano in Alaska erupted generating earthquakes, avalanches, and projected tephra ash approximately two hundred and ninety kilometers away. This dome volcano is over forty thousand years old and has erupted 11 times since 1800.

=== South America ===

In South America, there are several historic active volcanoes. In southern Chile, the Chaitén volcano erupted in 2011 adding 160 meters to its rim. Prehistoric weapons and tools, formed from obsidian tephra blocks, were dated at 5,610 years ago and were discovered 400 km away. Due to the location of the subduction zone of the eastern Pacific&#x27;s Nazca Plate, there are twenty one active volcanoes in southern Peru. In 2006, fossils, found under a layer of volcanic ash in Peru, were excavated by a team of paleontologists led by Mark D. Uhen, professor at George Mason University. The fossils were identified as 3 different types of archaeocetes, prehistoric whales, and are older than 36.61 million years which, as of 2011, makes them the oldest whale fossils discovered.

<text>Filfla is a mostly barren, uninhabited islet south of Malta, and is the most southerly point of the Maltese Archipelago. Filflu (or Filfluu), a rocky islet some southwest of Filfla, has the southernmost point of Malta. The name is believed to come from &quot;felfel&quot;, the Arabic for a peppercorn.

==Environment==
Filfla has an area of with a long coastline. It is a crumbling flat-topped limestone plateau surrounded by high cliffs. Three species of seabirds breed on the islet: the European storm petrel (with an estimated 5000 – 8000 pairs), Cory&#x27;s shearwater (c. 200 pairs) and yellow-legged gull (c. 130 pairs). The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International, principally because of the storm petrel colony. A type of wall lizard (&quot;Podarcis filfolensis&quot; ssp. &quot;filfolensis&quot;) and door snail (&quot;Lampedusa imitatrix gattoi&quot;) are endemic to Filfla. A large wild leek, growing up to high, also occurs. Access to Filfla is only possible for educational or scientific purposes, subject to prior permission from the Environment and Resources Authority.

==History==

Lone Island, also called the island of Filfla, was possibly sacred to the Neolithic inhabitants of Malta, who built the temples of Ħaġar Qim and Mnajdra on the Maltese coast opposite the islet.

The only known permanent structure on the island was a chapel built inside a cave in 1343, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1856 that also sank part of the island. A map of Malta dating back to 1798 shows a fort, a lighthouse and a monastery with a chapel on Filfla.

Until 1971 the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force used the island for target practice, and spent cartridges from these bombardments can still be found on Filfla today. It became a bird reserve in 1980. The &quot;Filfla Natural Reserve Act&quot;, enacted in 1988, provided for further restrictions on access and use, including a prohibition on fishing within one nautical mile (1.9 km) around the island due to the possibility of encountering unexploded ordnance.

Maltese Government notice 173 of 1990 once again permitted fishing within the one-mile zone.

Filfla was invoked in a territorial dispute over the continental shelf between Libya and Malta. The case was adjudicated by the International Court of Justice in 1985 essentially by ignoring the islet from the calculations.

==Legends==
The creation story of Filfla is linked to the legends surrounding the formation of Il-Maqluba. Maltese legend recounts that the area that now forms Il-Maqluba was inhabited by people who lived such dissolute lives that a neighbour warned them against their sinful ways, without them taking notice. God therefore wished to punish the sinners by engulfing the hamlet, saving only the wise neighbour. Angels are then said to have thrown a fragment of the hamlet into the sea, creating the isle of Filfla.

==In films==
Filfla served as the location of Scab Island in the 1980 film &quot;Popeye&quot;.

<text>Los Feliz (; Spanish for &quot;The Féliz (family)&quot;, ) is a hillside neighborhood in the greater Hollywood area of Los Angeles, California, abutting Hollywood and encompassing part of the Santa Monica Mountains. The neighborhood is named after the Feliz family of Californios who had owned the area since 1795, when José Vicente Féliz was granted Rancho Los Feliz.

==History==
===Indigenous era===
Long before the Spanish settlers arrived to settle near the banks of the Los Angeles River, Native Americans were the only inhabitants. It is estimated that the first Native Americans came to the area approximately 10,000 years ago. The Native Americans established villages, throughout the countryside. One of these settlements was within the boundaries of what was to become Rancho Los Feliz. Archeological surveys have found evidence of a substantial rancheria that existed in the mouth of Fern Dell Canyon in Griffith Park. The traditional name of this village is not known, but the inhabitants were Tongva. The name Gabrieleños was given to these people by the Spanish because of the Native Americans&#x27; association with the San Gabriel Mission.

===Spanish and Mexican eras===
When Gaspar de Portolà traveled through the vicinity in 1769, his expedition encountered members of this village.

The Rancho Los Feliz, one of the first land grants in California, was granted to Corporal José Vicente Feliz. An old adobe house built in the 1830s by his heirs still stands on Crystal Springs Drive in Griffith Park. Other sections of the rancho were developed and became the communities of Los Feliz and Silver Lake.

===Post-Conquest era===

Following the American conquest of California, Rancho Los Feliz had a succession of owners after the Feliz family. The family first sold the rancho to noted statesman Antonio F. Coronel, before it passed to James Lick, whose estate sold the rancho to Griffith J. Griffith. Griffith donated over half of the ranch to the city of Los Angeles. This ranch became one of the largest city-owned parks in the country, Griffith Park.

In 1882, Colonel Griffith acquired of Rancho Los Feliz. The Lick estate still owned the southwest portion of the rancho and there developed the Lick Tract, which later became a part of Hollywood. Griffith never served in any branch of the U.S. armed forces, but he was given the honorary title of colonel by influential friends in the California National Guard. The title remained a permanent fixture to his name.

===Modern era===

In 1900, there were only 23 properties in Los Feliz.

Griffith died on July 6, 1919, at the age of 67. Griffith bequeathed $700,000 and his Los Feliz acreage to the city of Los Angeles to be used for additions to Griffith Park.

On August 9, 1969, Charles Manson and six others murdered supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary in their home located at 3301 Waverly Drive in Los Feliz, henceforth known as the Tate–LaBianca murders. 

On May 8–9, 2007, about of uninhabited terrain in Los Feliz and Griffith Park, including the famous Dante&#x27;s View, were destroyed in a wildfire. After the fire, Los Angeles city officials pledged millions of dollars in aid to repair the damage.

==Geography==

Los Feliz encompasses several smaller but distinct areas, including the Los Feliz Hills and Los Feliz Estates (north of Los Feliz Boulevard), Laughlin Park, Los Feliz Village, Los Feliz Square, Los Feliz Knolls, and Franklin Hills.

According to the Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Los Feliz is part of central Los Angeles. It is flanked on the north by Griffith Park, on the northeast by Atwater Village, on the southeast by Silver Lake, on the south by East Hollywood, and on the northwest by Hollywood and Hollywood Hills. Los Feliz is situated near the 101 and the 5 freeways in Hollywood and Atwater Village respectively. The neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries (as used by Mapping L.A.) are the Griffith Park line between Fern Dell Drive and Riverside Drive on the north; the Los Angeles River on the east; Hyperion Avenue and Griffith Park Boulevard on the southeast; Fountain Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard on the south; and Western Avenue, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Fern Dell Drive on the west and northwest. The boundaries of the Los Feliz Improvement Association extend further west to Canyon Drive.

Los Feliz experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), just like most of Central Los Angeles.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 35,238 residents in the 2.61-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 13,512 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in Los Angeles County. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 36,933. The median age for residents was 36, older than in the city as a whole; the percentage of residents aged 65 and older was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was highly diverse ethnically. The breakdown was whites, 57.6%; Latinos, 18.7%; Asians, 13.5%; blacks, 3.7%, and others, 6.6%. Armenia (25.3%) and Mexico (9.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 44.5% of the residents who were born abroad, a high ratio compared to the rest of Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $50,793, about the same as the rest of Los Angeles, but a high rate of households earned $20,000 or less per year. The average household size of two people was low for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 75.5% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners the rest.

The percentages of never-married men (50.2%) and never-married women (37.2%) were among the county&#x27;s highest, as was the percentage of widowed women (10.1%).

==Communities==

The Los Feliz Neighborhood Council is divided into six interest areas, which include the following communities:
* District A: Los Feliz Hills and Los Feliz Estates
* District B: Los Feliz Square, Laughlin Park, and Thai Town North
* District C: Los Feliz Village
* District D: Los Feliz Knolls and Waverly Heights
* District E: Franklin Hills and a few neighboring blocks
* District F: West Los Feliz
The Oaks, a hilly neighborhood on the west side of Los Feliz bordering Griffith Park, is part of the Hollywood United Neighborhood Council. It is, however, within the boundaries of the Los Feliz Improvement Association.

===Los Feliz Hills===

The area north of Los Feliz Boulevard below Griffith Park is commonly referred to as the Los Feliz Hills. The Los Feliz Hills contain multimillion-dollar homes and have been known for the large share of their inhabitants being involved in creative pursuits. The mean household income is $196,585.

The original subdivision of Los Feliz Heights was subdivided in 1921, from Los Feliz Boulevard north to Griffith Park, from Catalina to Vermont. The Los Feliz Heights Residential Historic District is significant for Period Revival architecture (including American Colonial, Spanish Colonial, Mediterranean, and Tudor Revival styles) from 1920 to 1949. The original subdivision of Hillhurst Park was between Los Feliz Boulevard and Griffith Park, from Vermont Avenue to Commonwealth Avenue. The original subdivision of Los Feliz Hills was to the east, abutting Riverside Drive, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Griffith Park.

===Laughlin Park===

The gated community of Laughlin Park has 60 houses. In 1998, Laura Meyers of &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot; described the area as &quot;The most seductive, exclusive neighborhood in Los Feliz&quot;. W.C. Fields lived here in an Italianate residence built in 1919.

===Los Feliz Village===
Los Feliz Village is the southern section of Los Feliz, home to most of the commercial storefronts in the district. It is centered on the thoroughfares of Vermont and Hillhurst Avenues and spans from approximately Prospect Avenue to Los Feliz Boulevard. There are several coffee shops, restaurants, and small clothing and vintage stores.

Los Feliz Village Business Improvement District helps promote local businesses and has an annual street fair.

In February 2014, a local shop called Dumb Starbucks was opened as a bit for the Comedy Central show &quot;Nathan for You&quot; in Los Feliz Village. It has gained notoriety as a parody of Starbucks.

==Education==

Forty-two percent of Los Feliz residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree in 2000, a high figure for the city.

The schools within Los Feliz are as follows:
* John Marshall Senior High School, LAUSD, 3939 Tracy Street. Designed by architect George M. Lindsey in the Collegiate Gothic style, the school opened on January 26, 1931. After the Sylmar earthquake of 1971, some of Marshall&#x27;s buildings were condemned. The cafeteria was torn down, but the Main Building was preserved. In 1975, it was closed for structural strengthening, and in September 1981 it was reopened. Mike Haynes Stadium, the school&#x27;s football and track arena, dates to 1981 and was renovated with a regulation Olympic track and new turf field in 2010.
* Franklin Avenue Elementary School, LAUSD, 1910 North Commonwealth Avenue
* Los Feliz Elementary School, LAUSD, 1740 North New Hampshire Avenue
* Thomas Starr King Middle School, LAUSD, 4201 Fountain Avenue
* Our Mother of Good Counsel, private elementary, 4622 Ambrose Avenue
* Lycée International de Los Angeles Los Feliz campus, private elementary

In 1998, Laura Meyers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that residents of the Laughlin Park section of Los Feliz &quot;tend not to send their kids to the local public schools&quot; and instead &quot;often&quot; select the Lycée International or the Oaks School.

The Immaculate Heart school is in close proximity to the community.

==In popular culture==

Buena Vista Street, the entrance to the California Adventure theme park at the Disneyland Resort, is partly modeled after Los Feliz in the 1920s and 1930s. The Disney Buena Vista Street includes a retail location called &quot;Los Feliz Five and Dime.&quot; Disney&#x27;s Hyperion studio was situated in the Los Feliz area where a Gelson&#x27;s Market now stands.

In J.G. Quintel&#x27;s series &quot;Close Enough&quot;, the main characters live in Los Feliz.

In &quot;Swingers&quot;, the main characters discuss their personal lives while playing at golf at Los Feliz 9-hole, par 3 golf course.

<text>Mount Washington is a historic neighborhood in the San Rafael Hills of Northeast Los Angeles, California. Founded in 1909, it includes the Southwest Museum, the world headquarters of the Self-Realization Fellowship, and Eldred Street, one of the three steepest streets in the United States.

==History==
In the 19th century the area was part of Rancho San Rafael.

Mount Washington was founded in 1909 as a subdivision laid out by real estate developer Robert Marsh. Marsh built the Mount Washington Hotel at the summit of Mount Washington, and the Los Angeles and Mount Washington Railway Company was soon established as a funicular railway up the hill as an alternative to constructing roads up the area&#x27;s steep hillsides. The railway operated until January 1919.

By the late 2000s, the neighborhood attracted middle- and upper-income residents, mostly whites, Latinos, and Asians.&lt;ref name=&quot;N.Y. Times Mapping America: Every City, Every Block, Racial/Ethnic Distribution Map&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is generally considered the most affluent area of the East Side, and also contains the region&#x27;s largest concentration of non-Latino whites (though not as affluent as the neighboring cities of South Pasadena, San Marino, and southwest Pasadena; for instance, 30% of census tract 1851 (Mount Washington) has incomes of $100,000 or greater; while 35% of census tract 4806 (South Pasadena) has incomes of $100,000 or greater). The &quot;beauty and the quirky nature of Mount Washington&quot; has inspired songs.

In recent years, many homebuyers have become attracted to the area as a relatively affordable alternative to the Westside.

==Population==

The 2000 U.S. census counted 12,728 residents in the 1.85-square-mile Mount Washington neighborhood—or 6,878 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 13,531.

In 2008 the median age for residents was 33, about average for the city and the county. The percentage of never-married men (40.9%) was among the county&#x27;s highest.

According to the Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; based on the 2000 census, the neighborhood was &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically, with a high percentage of Latino residents. The breakdown was Latinos, 61.2%; whites, 20.8%; Asians, 12.8%; blacks, 2.6%; and others, 2.7%. Mexico (44.4%) and El Salvador (9.6%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.5% of the residents who were born abroad—an average figure for Los Angeles.

Over the last decade, the demographics have been shifting. As of 2009, Mount Washington has no racial or ethnic group in a majority. According to the American Community Survey (2009), Mount Washington is 33% White, 3% Black, 47% Latino, 9% Asian, and 7% other (census tract 1851). The only census tract entirely within Mount Washington&#x27;s boundaries is census tract 1851 (census tracts 1852 and 1862 are also in Mount Washington but also include surrounding neighborhoods). Census tract 1851 is on the east side of Mount Washington, and includes Moon Canyon Park and the Carlin G. Smith Recreation area; and it is extremely racially and ethnically diverse, even for Los Angeles.

The 2000 census found that the median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $57,725, about average for the city. The average household size of 2.9 people was about the same as Los Angeles as a whole. Renters occupied 45.1% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 54.9%.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2010, Mount Washington (tract 1851) has a median household income of about $60,000; and 30% of its residents have a household income greater than $100,000 per year; neighboring census tracts shared with Mount Washington and other neighborhoods also have somewhat similar income data.

==Geography==

According to the Mapping L.A. project, Mount Washington is bordered on the north by Eagle Rock, on the east by Highland Park, on the south, southwest and west by Cypress Park and on the northwest by Glassell Park.

Mount Washington is split between Los Angeles City Council districts 1 and 14 and is part of California&#x27;s 34th congressional district. The neighborhood lies mostly within ZIP code 90065, with an eastern portion in 90042, and the area code is 323.

==Education==

Twenty-five percent of Mount Washington residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for both the city and the county. One school lies within the neighborhood — Mount Washington Elementary School, LAUSD, at 3981 San Rafael Avenue. Mount Washington students &quot;consistently score among the top schools in Los Angeles on the Academic Performance Index.&quot;

<doc id="434599" wikidata="Q604949" url="?curid=434599" title="Víctor Manuel Gerena">
<text>Víctor Manuel Gerena (born June 24, 1958) is an American fugitive wanted by the FBI for the September 1983 White Eagle armed robbery, as a Wells Fargo employee and a member of the Boricua Popular Army, of a Wells Fargo armored car facility. The more than million (equivalent to more than $million in ) was the largest cash robbery in U.S. history at that time.

On May 14, 1984, Gerena became the 386th fugitive to be placed on the FBI&#x27;s Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He remains at large, and on April 11, 2010, became the fugitive to have spent the most time on the list, surpassing Donald Eugene Webb, who was removed from the list on March 31, 2007, after 25 years, 10 months, and 27 days after Webb was presumed dead. Gerena was removed from the list on December 15, 2016, after 32 years. He is believed to be living in Cuba.

==Bank heist==
According to law enforcement authorities, on September 12, 1983, Gerena dropped off his girlfriend at Hartford City Hall, where she was to get a marriage license for the couple. He then went to work and spent the rest of the day with co-workers James McKeon and Timothy Girard. At some point, Gerena removed McKeon&#x27;s gun, handcuffed and tied up his two co-workers, and injected them with aspirin and water in order to further disable them (Gerena thought it would make them sleepy), which did not work. He put $7,000,000 in the trunk of a car, then left with the money.

==Fugitive==

According to published reports, Gerena was transported to Mexico, where he boarded a Cubana de Aviación jet at Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City, arriving at José Martí International Airport in Havana. Years later, a cousin of Gerena accompanied journalist Edmund Mahoney to Cuba in an attempt to locate Gerena, but they did not succeed. Mahoney published a story in 2001 titled &quot;Chasing Gerena&quot;.

<text>Patrick Hall (born 20 October 1951) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bedford from 1997 to 2010. He was re-selected by the Labour Party as their candidate in Bedford for the 2015 general election, but failed to be re-elected to Parliament.

==Early life==
Patrick Hall was educated at the independent Bedford Modern School, the University of Birmingham and Oxford Polytechnic. He joined Bedford Borough Council in 1975 as a local government planning officer, becoming the borough&#x27;s Town Centre Coordinator. Hall remained employed by the council until his election to Parliament.

He was elected as a councillor to the Bedfordshire County Council 1989–97 and was a member of the North Bedfordshire Community Health Council. He contested Bedfordshire North at the 1992 General Election, but was defeated by the veteran Conservative MP Trevor Skeet by 11,618 votes.

==Parliamentary career==
Patrick Hall was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for the new seat of Bedford with a majority of 8,300. He was re-elected at the 2001 and 2005 election. Hall was Bedford&#x27;s third Labour MP and the first to hold the seat for more than one term.

He made his maiden speech on 30 July 1997, where he celebrated the history of Bedford and paid tribute to the town&#x27;s diverse population. He also raised issues about the lack adequate and affordable housing supply, a cause which he would champion throughout his parliamentary career.

Hall made his reputation as being an attentive constituency-based MP. His work in Parliament reflected his experience in town planning, becoming the chair of the all-parliamentary group on town centre management. He was also a vocal campaigner on better transport links for Bedford, pushing for the Bedford by-pass and rail investment for the town&#x27;s many commuters.

In 2003, Hall was one of 139 Labour MPs to rebel against the Government whip by voting in favour of an amendment which stated that there was no moral case for war in Iraq. In the end, Hall did not vote for the declaration of war, choosing not to vote on the motion.

In his final term in Parliament, Hall voiced his opposition to the Trident nuclear weapons programme, voting against its continuance.

During the expenses scandal, Hall remained one of the few MPs to be applauded for his integrity on claims. His expenses claims were among the lowest total claims of all MPs. He was described as one of the &#x27;saints&#x27; by the Daily Telegraph, the newspaper which broke the expenses scandal story in 2009.

Hall lost his seat in the 2010 General Election to Conservative candidate Richard Fuller, who had also challenged him unsuccessfully in 2005. Fuller&#x27;s slim majority of 1,353 made Bedford the Conservatives&#x27; twenty-fifth most marginal seat in Britain and a major target for Labour at the next general election.

On 30 June 2012, he was selected as Labour candidate for Bedford for the 2015 general election, but was defeated in the 2015 General Election.

==Personal life==

Patrick is married to Claudia and has two step sons, Giovanni and Gabriele. He enjoys squash and gardening.

<text>David Hamilton (15 April 1933 – 25 November 2016) was a British photographer and film director best known for his photography of young women and girls, mostly nude. Hamilton&#x27;s images became part of an &quot;art or pornography&quot; debate.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in 1933 and grew up in London. His schooling was interrupted by World War II. As an evacuee, he spent some time in the countryside of Dorset, which inspired some of his work. After the war, Hamilton returned to London and finished his schooling.
==Career and later life==
His artistic skills began to emerge during a job at an architect&#x27;s office. At age 20, he went to Paris, where he worked as a graphic designer for Peter Knapp of &quot;Elle&quot; magazine. After becoming known and successful, he was hired away from &quot;Elle&quot; by &quot;Queen&quot; magazine in London as an art director. Hamilton soon realised his love for Paris, however, and after returning there, he became the art director of Printemps, the city&#x27;s largest department store. While Hamilton was still employed at Printemps, he began doing commercial photography, and the dreamy, grainy style of his images quickly brought him success.
His photographs were in demand by other magazines such as &quot;Réalités&quot;, &quot;Twen&quot; and &quot;Photo&quot;. By the end of the 1960s, all of Hamilton&#x27;s photographs appeared to have been snapped as if through a hazy mist. His further successes included dozens of photographic books with combined sales well into the millions; five feature films; countless magazine displays and museum and gallery exhibitions. His work was exhibited in every one of the first three years of The Photographers&#x27; Gallery, London, but was roundly condemned by photojournalist Euan Duff for its &quot;cliched pictorial symbolism, exploiting soft focus, pastel colours, country landscapes and old houses, old fashioned clothes and even white doves to give a phoney impression of heaIthy-food ad naturalness; they are a sort of wholemeal stoneground pornography,&quot; exhibited &quot;because the gallery needs the money.&quot; 

In December 1977, Images Gallery — a studio owned by Bob Persky at 11 East 57th Street in Manhattan — showed his photographs at the same time that &quot;Bilitis&quot; was released. At that time, art critic Gene Thornton wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that they reveal &quot;the kind of ideal that regularly was expressed in the great paintings of the past&quot;. Hamilton has said that his work looks for &quot;the candor of a lost paradise&quot;. In his book, &quot;Contemporary Photographers&quot;, curator Christian Caujolle wrote that Hamilton worked only with two fixed devices: &quot;a clear pictorial intention and a latent eroticism, ostensibly romantic, but asking for trouble&quot;.
In 1995, Hamilton said that people &quot;have made contradictions of nudity and purity, sensuality and innocence, grace and spontaneity. I try to harmonize them, and that&#x27;s my secret and the reason for my success&quot;. Besides depicting young women and girls, Hamilton composed photographs of flowers, men, landscapes, farm animals, pigeons, and still lifes of fresh fruit. Several of his photographs look like oil paintings. Most of his work gives the impression of timelessness because of the absence of cars, modern buildings and advertisement boards. In 1976, Denise Couttès explained Hamilton&#x27;s phenomenal success on page 6 of &quot;The Best of David Hamilton&quot;. His images, she wrote, &quot;express escapism. People can only escape from the violence and cruelty of the modern world through dreams and nostalgia&quot;.
His soft focus style came back into fashion at &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, and other fashion magazines beginning around 2003. Hamilton had been in a relationship with Mona Kristensen (b. 1950), a model in many of his early photobooks who made her screen debut in &quot;Bilitis&quot;. Later, he married Gertrude Versyp, who co-designed &quot;The Age of Innocence,&quot; but they divorced amicably.
Hamilton divided his time between Saint-Tropez and Paris. He had been enjoying a revival in popularity since 2005. In 2006, &quot;David Hamilton&quot;, a collection of captioned photographs, and &quot;Erotic Tales&quot;, which contains Hamilton&#x27;s fictional short stories, were published.
At the time of his death, Hamilton had another book in the works, a monograph about Montenegro. He was working with Jelica Bujić, who was his first and last photography assistant.

==Reception==
Much of Hamilton&#x27;s work depicted early-teen girls, often nude, and he was the subject of some controversy including child pornography allegations, similar to those which the work of Sally Mann and Jock Sturges have attracted. For moral reasons, several of Hamilton&#x27;s books were banned in South Africa.
In the late 1990s, conservative Christian groups in America unsuccessfully protested against bookstores selling Hamilton&#x27;s photography books. As Chris Warmoll, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005, commented, &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s photographs have long been at the forefront of the &#x27;is it art or pornography?&#x27; debate.&quot;
In 2005, a man in the UK was convicted for being in possession of 19,000 images of children, including photos by Hamilton. The images were found to have the lowest indecency rating. In response, Glenn Holland, Hamilton&#x27;s spokesman, said: &quot;We are deeply saddened and disappointed by this, as David is one of the most successful art photographers the world has ever known. His books have sold millions&quot;.
In 2010, a man was convicted of level 1 child pornography for owning four books, including Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; as well as &quot;Still Time&quot; by Sally Mann, which he purchased from a bookstore in Walthamstow, London. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 2011, with the judge calling his conviction &quot;very unfair&quot; and criticising the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for prosecuting him. The judge concluded that &quot;If the [CPS] wishes to test whether the pictures in the books are indecent, the right way to deal with the matter is by way of prosecuting the publisher or retailer – not the individual purchaser.&quot;
==Sexual assault allegations==
In October 2016, French presenter Flavie Flament accused him of raping her in 1987, when she was 13 years old. In November 2016, French magazine &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot; published anonymous accounts from three other former models who claimed to have been raped by Hamilton. Hamilton issued a statement threatening legal action against his accusers and claimed that he did not do anything wrong. On 25 November 2016, he was found dead in his Paris apartment by apparent suicide.

On 22 October 2016, Thierry Ardisson, the host of the French talk-show &quot;Salut les Terriens!&quot; on TNT C8 channel, named Hamilton as the alleged rapist of now radio RTL presenter Flavie Flament. According to Flament, the acts were committed in 1987, when she was 13 years old, in Cap d&#x27;Agde, a naturist resort in Hérault, southern France. She mentions them in her novel &quot;La consolation&quot;, a romanticised story based on her purported life experiences. After Flament publicly identified Hamilton, the book led to Hamilton being accused of being a predatory paedophile. Flament&#x27;s brother has called certain revelations in her book into question. He also states that at the time Flavie complained of inappropriate behaviour by the photographer resulting in her parents stopping Hamilton from continuing with her. 

On 22 November 2016, Hamilton issued a statement threatening legal action against his accusers. When contacted by the French press agency AFP, Hamilton declared that he was not to blame. &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong,&quot; he said, while claiming only that he took a portrait of Flament, &quot;29 or 30 years ago&quot;. Flament put the portrait on the cover of &quot;La consolation&quot;.
On 17 November 2016, the weekly news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot; published anonymous accounts by three other former models who claimed to have been raped by Hamilton. One day later, Flament claimed that Hamilton was the rapist whom she had not identified in her book.

== Death ==
On the evening of 25 November 2016, Hamilton&#x27;s cleaning lady entered the apartment of the 83-year-old photographer at 41 Boulevard Montparnasse in southern Paris and found him dead with a plastic bag over his head and medications close at hand. The autopsy revealed that asphyxiation was the cause of death. Suicide is the leading hypothesis in the investigation.

<text>Fabian Uziell-Hamilton (born 12 April 1955) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds North East since 1997. He served as Shadow Minister for Peace and Disarmament from November 2016 to September 2023.

== Early life and career ==
Fabian Uziell-Hamilton was born on 12 April 1955 in London to a British Jewish family. His grandfather was a rabbi. His father Mario, a solicitor, and his mother Adrianne, a judge, were members of the Liberal Party, for which his father was several times an election candidate. 

He was educated at Brentwood School in Essex where he participated in the school&#x27;s dramatic productions, playing a minor role in the Shakespeare play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; alongside Douglas Adams and Griff Rhys Jones. He then attended the University of York where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree.

From 1978, he worked as a taxi driver for a year before working as a graphic designer. From 1994 until his election to parliament in 1997, he was a computer systems consultant with Apple Macintosh Computer Systems.

He was elected as a councillor to the City of Leeds Council in 1987, stepping down in 1998. He was elected as the chairman of the Leeds West Constituency Labour Party in 1987.

== Parliamentary career ==
Hamilton stood as the Labour candidate in Leeds North East at the 1992 general election, coming second with 36.8% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP Timothy Kirkhope.

Despite having achieved the highest Labour swing in the North of England, the constituency Labour Party voted, by a margin of one vote, in favour of an all-women shortlist. Hamilton was quoted by &quot;The Independent&quot; as saying:

Leeds North-East made its selection on 1 July 1995, selecting Liz Davies, a barrister and councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Davies defeated four local women, two of whom were Leeds city councillors. Her selection was vetoed by the National Executive Committee, allegedly for her left-wing politics; unhappy with the situation, opponents took out an unsuccessful private prosecution against Hamilton under the Companies Act in connection with his printing business. Hamilton won the subsequent selection process.

At the 1997 general election, Hamilton was elected to Parliament as MP for Leeds North East with 49.2% of the vote and a majority of 6,959. He made his maiden speech on 23 June 1997, in which he explained that his constituency stretches from the inner-city Leeds district of Chapeltown all the way out to Harewood House, the stately home of the Earls of Harewood.

In Parliament he served as a member of the Administration Select committee 1997–2001, and has been a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

Hamilton was re-elected as MP for Leeds North East at the 2001 general election with a decreased vote share of 49.1% and an increased majority of 7,089. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 44.9% and a decreased majority of 5,262.

In November 2006, Hamilton was a signatory of the Euston Manifesto and of the statement of principles of the Henry Jackson Society a neoconservative foreign policy think tank.

In October 2008, Hamilton was the first MP to hold a virtual surgery for constituents who can go to his constituency office while he is in London, and converse via webcam.

Hamilton was again re-elected at the 2010 general election with a decreased vote share of 42.7% and a decreased majority of 4,545.

He was a signatory of an open letter to the then-Labour Party leader Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements. 

He supports Labour Friends of Israel and in April 2015 was critical of Ed Miliband&#x27;s stance on the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict.

Hamilton was again re-elected at the 2015 general election, with an increased vote share of 47.9% and an increased majority of 7,250.

On 7 January 2016, Hamilton was appointed a shadow Foreign Minister, outside the Shadow Cabinet. On 29 June 2016, Hamilton was appointed as Shadow Europe Minister to replace Pat Glass, who resigned over concerns about Corbyn&#x27;s leadership. Hamilton resigned a few days later on 4 July 2016, saying that he was troubled by Corbyn&#x27;s response to the Chakrabarti Inquiry into anti-Semitism.

At the snap 2017 general election, Hamilton was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 63.1% and an increased majority of 16,991. He was re-elected as MP for Leeds North East at the 2019 general election with a decreased vote share of 57.5% and an increased majority of 17,089. Hamilton was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 51.5% and a decreased majority of 16,083.

In November 2024, Hamilton voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted suicide.

=== Expenses scandal===
In 2009 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Hamilton had incorrectly claimed £3,000 on expenses for mortgage payments. In addition to the interest on the mortgage, which can be claimed as an expense, Hamilton claimed for interest on an equity release scheme on the house, which cannot.

Hamilton responded in a statement that this was &quot;a genuine mistake&quot; and that the money was paid back when the error was discovered by the House of Commons Fees Office. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; also accused Hamilton of &quot;flipping&quot; his second home designation to decorate and furnish both his constituency home in Leeds and London flat. Hamilton defended his actions and accused the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of &quot;deliberately misrepresenting&quot; him.

== Personal life ==
He married Rosemary in 1980: they have two daughters and a son.

He is a keen cyclist, and once cycled to Aachen, Germany, raising funds for the Funzi and Bodo Trust, a children&#x27;s charity based in Kenya. 

He speaks fluent French.

As a result of mergers, he has successively been a member of Graphical, Paper and Media Union, Amicus, and Unite.

<doc id="434606" wikidata="Q332987" url="?curid=434606" title="Philip Hammond">
<text>Philip Hammond, Baron Hammond of Runnymede (born 4 December 1955) is a British politician and life peer who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2016 to 2019 and Foreign Secretary from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as Defence Secretary from 2011 to 2014 and Transport Secretary from 2010 to 2011. A member of the Conservative Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Runnymede and Weybridge from 1997 to 2019.

Born in Epping, Essex, Hammond studied Philosophy, politics and economics at University College, Oxford. He worked from 1984 as a company director at Castlemead Ltd – a healthcare and nursing company. From 1995 to 1997, he acted as an adviser to the government of Malawi before his election to Parliament.

Hammond served in the Shadow Cabinets of Michael Howard and David Cameron as Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2005 to 2007 and Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 2005 and from 2007 to 2010. After the formation of the Coalition Government in May 2010, he was appointed Secretary of State for Transport and was sworn of the Privy Council. Upon the resignation of Liam Fox over a scandal in October 2011, Hammond was promoted to replace him as Secretary of State for Defence, before being further promoted in July 2014 to become Foreign Secretary.

In July 2016, after Theresa May succeeded Cameron as prime minister, Hammond was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. As chancellor, Hammond suggested that the government may begin a reduction in austerity measures. In July 2019, he spoke in an interview with Andrew Marr of his plans to tender his resignation to Theresa May should Boris Johnson become the new Leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, on the grounds that, should he be part of the Johnson Cabinet, collective responsibility would require him to support a no-deal Brexit. With the later selection of Johnson as the next prime minister, he tendered his resignation to May. He had the Conservative whip removed in September 2019 for voting against Johnson&#x27;s government and subsequently sat as an independent MP, while remaining a member of the party. He did not stand for re-election in the 2019 election.

==Early life==
Hammond was born in Epping, Essex, the son of a civil engineer. He was educated at Shenfield School (now Shenfield High School) in Brentwood, Essex, where he was a classmate of Richard Madeley. He then read Philosophy, politics and economics at University College, Oxford, where he was an Open Scholar, and graduated with a first-class honours degree.

Hammond joined the medical equipment manufacturers Speywood Laboratories Ltd in 1977, becoming a director of Speywood Medical Limited in 1981. He left in 1983 and, from 1984, served as a director in Castlemead Ltd.

From 1993 to 1995, he was a partner in CMA Consultants and, from 1994, a director in Castlemead Homes. He had many business interests including house building and property, manufacturing, healthcare, and oil and gas. He worked as a consultant to the Government of Malawi from 1995 until his election to Parliament.

==Early political career==
Hammond was the Chairman of the Lewisham East Conservative Association for seven years from 1989, and was also a political assistant to Colin Moynihan, then MP for Lewisham East and Minister of Sport. He contested the 1994 Newham North East by-election following the death of sitting Labour MP Ron Leighton, losing in this rock-solid Labour seat to Stephen Timms by 11,818 votes, Hammond only polling 14.5% of the vote. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election for the newly created Surrey seat of Runnymede and Weybridge. He won the seat with a majority of 9,875 and remained its MP until 2019. He made his maiden speech on 17 June 1997.

In Parliament, he served on the Environment, Transport and the Regions Select committee from 1997 until he was promoted by William Hague as front bench spokesman for Health. He was moved to become a spokesman for Trade and Industry by Iain Duncan Smith in 2001, and later transferred to Shadow Minister for Local Government and Regions in 2002.

Howard promoted Hammond to his Shadow Cabinet following the 2005 general election as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Following the election of David Cameron as Conservative leader later in 2005, Hammond became the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. He was moved back to the role of Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in David Cameron&#x27;s reshuffle following Gordon Brown&#x27;s accession to the premiership.

==In government==

===Secretary of State for Transport (2010–2011)===
Hammond was appointed Secretary of State for Transport following the formation of the coalition government on 12 May 2010, a position he held until 14 October 2011.

On 28 September 2011, the government initiated a consultation on plans to raise the speed limit on motorways from 70 mph to 80 mph, to introduce the new limit in 2013. However, following criticism, including that modelling predicted a 20+% increase in motorway deaths and would alienate women voters, the plans were dropped by his successor.

===Secretary of State for Defence (2011–2014)===
Hammond became Secretary of State for Defence on 14 October 2011 when Liam Fox resigned. As Secretary of State for Defence, Hammond became a member of the National Security Council.

In December 2011, women were allowed to serve on Royal Navy submarines. The first women officers began serving on s in late 2013. They were due to be followed by female ratings in 2015, when women should also begin serving on the new s. It was also confirmed that the cost of the Libyan operations was £212 million – less than was estimated – including £67 million for replacing spent munitions, is all expected to be met from HM Treasury&#x27;s reserve.

In January 2012, the Ministry of Defence cut 4,200 jobs in the second round of armed forces redundancies. The Army would see up to 2,900 job cuts, including 400 Gurkhas, while the RAF would lose up to 1,000 members and the Royal Navy up to 300. The job losses would account for some of the cuts under the defence review – intended to help plug the £38 billion hole in the defence budget. Hammond said the Government had &quot;no choice but to reduce the size of the armed forces – while reconfiguring them to ensure they remain agile, adaptable and effective&quot;.

The £38 billion &quot;black hole&quot; in Ministry of Defence finances had been &quot;dealt with&quot; and the department&#x27;s &quot;hand to mouth existence would come to an end&quot;, Hammond stated in February 2012. Ministers had even found £2.1 billion to be allocated to several major spending projects to be introduced in the coming weeks. The money was to come from a combination of cuts over the previous two years, bargaining with industry suppliers and a one per cent increase in the equipment budget.

In February 2012, Hammond said that the Falkland Islands did not face a &quot;current credible military threat&quot; from Argentina. He added that Britain had &quot;no desire or intention to increase the heat&quot; surrounding their sovereignty. Speaking in the House of Commons he said &quot;despite media speculation to the contrary, there has been no recent change to force levels&quot;, adding &quot;there is no evidence of any current credible military threat to the security of the Falkland Islands and therefore no current plan for significant changes to force deployments.&quot;

In August 2012, Hammond cut senior positions within the &quot;top-heavy&quot; military by a quarter. Around 26 civilian and military head office posts would go and a new senior structure would come in from April 2013. The move was expected to save the Ministry of Defence around £3.8 million a year. Hammond said one in four posts from the ranks of commodore, brigadier, air commodore and above would go.

Four weeks before the London Olympic Games of 2012, the security company G4S could not provide the number of security staff it had originally undertaken to deploy for the games. Hammond solved the problem by deploying 5,000 members of the armed forces making good the shortfall. Their performance attracted widespread praise.

===Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (2014–2016)===


On 15 July 2014, Hammond was appointed Foreign Secretary. Newspapers highlighted his &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; credentials, and his confidence that Britain could &quot;get a deal&quot; on reforming the European Union. He said that he would vote in a putative referendum for a British exit from the European Union unless there were changes in the relationship, but following David Cameron&#x27;s renegotiation, he supported the Remain campaign.

In August 2014, Hammond said he was surprised at the sudden resignation of Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi, who wrote of &quot;great unease&quot; under his leadership of the Foreign office.

In March 2015, Hammond stated that Britain would support the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen &quot;in every practical way short of engaging in combat.&quot; He also told Parliament that the Saudi-led coalition had complied with humanitarian law. This statement was later corrected by the Foreign Office as, according to the Foreign Office, he should have said: &quot;Looking at all the information available to us, we have been unable to assess that there has been a breach of International Humanitarian Law by the Saudi-led coalition&quot;. As a result of these discrepancies, Labour MP Ann Clwyd asked the Commons Speaker John Bercow to refer the incident to the relevant parliamentary authority so that they can decide whether Hammond deliberately misled the MPs or if it was an honest mistake.

In March 2015, speaking as the minister responsible for the intelligence agencies, he suggested that terror &quot;apologists&quot; must share blame in terrorist acts, saying &quot;But a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them.&quot;On 8 July 2015, Hammond condemned the defeat by Russia at the UN Security Council of his four-page draft resolution S/2015/508, which would have applied the genocide label to the Srebrenica massacre of Muslim Bosniaks in 1995. Angola, China, Nigeria and Venezuela abstained, while the draft had been proposed by Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia, New Zealand, the UK and the US. The Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, criticised the British wording as &quot;confrontational and politically-motivated&quot;, arguing that it unfairly singled out Bosnian Serbs for committing war crimes in a conflict in which all three ethnic groups were the victims of atrocities. Hammond stated that: &quot;We are disappointed that our resolution to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Srebrenica was vetoed today.&quot;

On 14 July 2015, after several years of on-again-off-again negotiations, the P5+1 reached agreement with Iran over the Nuclear program of Iran. Hammond was present in Vienna as the UK representative for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action disclosure ceremony. Hammond presented the deal in Commons the next day, and was in Jerusalem for a joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, which was described as &quot;tense&quot;.

Hammond described the United Nations findings regarding the detention of Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 6 February 2016 as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Mads Andenæs commented, &quot;When countries respond in this way, they damage the respect for the rule of law and the United Nations.&quot;

In October 2015, Justice Secretary Michael Gove cancelled a £5.9 million contract to provide services for prisons in the Saudi Arabia, saying &quot;the British government should not be assisting a regime that uses beheadings, stoning, crucifixions and lashings as forms of punishment.&quot; Foreign Secretary Hammond accused Gove of &quot;naivety&quot;.

In November 2015, Hammond was criticised for accepting a watch worth £1,950 from Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz. The watch was given as a gift after the unveiling of a statue of the Queen to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta. Ministers are not allowed to accept gifts worth more than £140 but Hammond claims he was advised that the event was a constituency one, not a ministerial one, and therefore the rules for ministers did not apply to him on that day. Labour MP John Mann was among those who criticised Hammond. &quot;What on earth was he doing?&quot; Mann asked, &quot;No MP should be accepting watches worth nearly £2,000 as a gift. He should now give it to charity.&quot;

===Chancellor of the Exchequer (2016–2019)===

Hammond was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by new Prime Minister Theresa May on 13 July 2016.

Hammond had backed Remain in the Brexit referendum, but confirmed he would support the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, saying &quot;No ifs, no buts, no second referendums. We are leaving the European Union. But it is equally clear to me that the British people did not vote on June 23 to become poorer, or less secure&quot; and that he would take whatever steps necessary to protect the economy, jobs and living standards.

In October 2016, Hammond was criticised by some Cabinet colleagues for &quot;arguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything&quot; rather than pressing ahead with plans for Brexit. Hammond called for caution during a Cabinet committee meeting, which discussed a proposed post-Brexit visa regime that would require all European Union workers to prove they have secured a skilled job before being allowed into Britain, which led to accusations that he was trying to &quot;undermine Brexit&quot;

According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Hammond&#x27;s priority was ensuring the UK retained full access to the EU&#x27;s single market for Britain&#x27;s financial industry. In January 2017, Hammond stated that the UK would leave the Single Market as it was not politically possible to continue to comply with all the EU&#x27;s rules regarding freedom of movement in the wake of the Brexit vote, saying that they would look to pursue a &quot;comprehensive free trade agreement&quot; instead.

In his first budget in March 2017, Hammond increased National Insurance contributions that self-employed people have to pay, despite the Conservatives making a manifesto pledge at the 2015 election not to increase NI. The policy was reversed a week later after opposition from some of his own backbenchers. The IFS argued in favour of the NIC rise, claiming the original pledge not to increase tax had been unwise. &quot;As we said at the time these were silly pledges. To commit yourself to not raising the three main taxes – income tax, NI and VAT – ties your hands to an absurd extent.&quot; George Eaton maintains the promise was intended as a negotiating tool as the Conservatives did not expect an outright majority. Hammond&#x27;s budget continued government policies of freezing benefits.

Following the 2017 general election, Hammond suggested that he may ease up on austerity in the coming autumn budget. Hammond said, &quot;Obviously we are not deaf. We heard a message last week in the general election and we need to look at how we deal with the challenges we face in the economy. I understand that people are weary after years of hard work to rebuild the economy after the great crash of 2008–09, but we have to live within our means. (...) We have never said we won&#x27;t raise some taxes.&quot;

In a June 2017 speech, Hammond said a Brexit deal that prioritised jobs and prosperity was the only way the UK would be able to deliver the strong growth that would allow the government to end its austerity measures. In his strongest-yet call for a managed approach, Hammond said a comprehensive trade agreement, a transitional deal after the 2019 deadline for the end of talks, and a commitment to keep borders open should form a three-point Brexit plan for Britain. There would be &quot;audible sighs of relief&quot;, he said, if the talks that ended with a business-friendly agreement.

In October 2017, Hammond referred to the European Union&#x27;s Brexit negotiators as &quot;the enemy&quot;. Shortly thereafter, however, he expressed regret for his choice of words.

In November 2017, Hammond said in an interview on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;, while talking about possible unemployment that comes with driverless vehicles, AI and robots, that the development of personal computers meant that there was no longer any need for shorthand typists. He then asked in reference to his previous comment: &quot;Where are all these unemployed people? There are no unemployed people.&quot; This was immediately noticed by the media, as there are roughly 1.42 million unemployed with more underemployed. This led to accusations that Hammond is out of touch with reality. Later in the same programme, he clarified his remarks, and again on &quot;Peston on Sunday&quot;, acknowledging on both occasions the real number of unemployed people in the UK.

On 22 November 2017, he presented his second budget.
In January 2018, senior Conservative MPs mounted pressure on Theresa May to sack him as Chancellor following his recent comments about Brexit, which were deemed too europhilic in nature.

In 2019, Hammond responded to the report by the UN&#x27;s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. The report argued that 14 million people in the UK live in poverty and 1.5 million are destitute. It claimed the government&#x27;s policies were &quot;punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous&quot;. Hammond said he &quot;rejects the idea that there are vast numbers of people facing dire poverty in this country. I don&#x27;t accept the UN rapporteur&#x27;s report at all. I think that&#x27;s nonsense. Look around you; that&#x27;s not what we see in this country.&quot;

In July 2019, with the expectation that Boris Johnson would become prime minister, Hammond asserted that he would work to avoid an immediate exit from the EU. In an interview on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; he said he planned to tender his resignation to Theresa May on 24 July immediately following Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions but before May stood down. He stated that should he be part of the Johnson Cabinet he would be required to support a no-deal Brexit, something he &quot;could never sign up to&quot;. He submitted his resignation to May stating that her successor &quot;must be free to choose a Chancellor who is fully aligned with his policy position&quot;.

The Minister of Treasury and Finance of the Republic of Turkey, Berat Albayrak, held a one-on-one and inter-delegation meeting with the Minister of Finance of the United Kingdom, Philip Hammond, and the Minister of State, Alan Duncan. It was learned that Minister Berat Albayrak explained in detail the policies he will put forward within the framework of a stronger strategic plan in the new period, in addition to the 15-year success story that Turkey has achieved with economic stability.

== Conservative backbencher and Independent ==
In August 2019, Hammond, and a number of other Conservative MPs including former Cabinet ministers Rory Stewart and David Gauke, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, accusing him of &quot;ruining&quot; any chance of a new deal with European Union by setting &quot;the bar on his red lines so high&quot;. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Hammond and several other remain supporters aimed at an extension to Article 50 with EU leaders.

On 3 September 2019, Hammond led 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion, which subsequently failed. Effectively, they helped block Johnson&#x27;s &quot;no-deal&quot; Brexit plan from proceeding on 31 October. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs and requiring them to sit as independents.

Hammond did not contest the 2019 general election, as he would be a &quot;direct challenge&quot; to the Conservative party. If he or the other rebel MPs had decided to run for re-election, the party would have blocked their selection as Conservative candidates. Hammond later suggested that &quot;the Conservative Party has been taken over by unelected advisors, entryists and usurpers who are trying to turn it from a broad church into an extreme right-wing faction&quot;, and that &quot;it is not the party I joined.&quot;

==Later career==
Boris Johnson nominated Hammond for a peerage in February 2020, along with Kenneth Clarke, who also had the Conservative whip removed. According to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, a cabinet minister criticised the decision to award Hammond a seat in the House of Lords, saying he &quot;tried to bring down the government&quot;.

Hammond had a business career in small and medium-sized companies in manufacturing, consultancy, property and construction, and oil and gas, both in the UK and abroad. On 13 July 2020, according to documents from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which oversees business appointments for former ministers, Hammond would be taking up a paid, part-time role as an advisor to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Minister of Finance. Hammond also worked at Francis Maude Associates, a consultancy founded by Francis Maude and Simone Finn, which trades as FMA.

Hammond was created Baron Hammond of Runnymede, &quot;of Runnymede in the County of Surrey&quot;, by Letters Patent dated 30 September 2020. Taking the Conservative whip, he made his maiden speech on 28 January 2021.

The cryptocurrency trading firm Copper Technologies employs Hammond as an adviser. Hammond holds a stake in the company worth $15 million. As of 2023, Hammond was Chair of Copper Technologies.

==Political positions==

===2008 financial crisis===
In May 2012, Hammond said that banks were not solely responsible for the 2008 financial crisis as &quot;they had to lend to someone&quot;. Hammond said that people who took out loans were &quot;consenting adults&quot;, who in some cases were now seeking to blame others for their actions.

===Same-sex marriage===
In May 2012, Hammond said same-sex marriage is &quot;too controversial&quot;. In January 2013 during a visit to Royal Holloway, University of London, he bracketed the tabled legislation, which was passed afterwards, alongside socially unacceptable relationships, at the upper scale of which he stated was the criminal offence of incest. Asked by &quot;PinkNews&quot; to clarify his remarks, Hammond wrote by email: &quot;The discussion ranged very widely and was not limited to same sex relationships&quot;.

In May 2013, Hammond abstained as one of four Cabinet Ministers not to vote in favour of same-sex marriage. Hammond was openly critical of the then Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s approach to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 and said in November 2013 that he was &quot;shocked&quot; by the speed with which it was pushed through and that it was &quot;damaging&quot; to the Conservative Party.

===Public service and taxation===
Hammond wants all earners, not only the wealthiest to pay higher taxes to finance improved public services, he feels borrowing will not work. Hammond said &quot;Of course you can tax wealthy people a bit more but the reality of the fiscal challenge we face is that if we want public services not just to be maintained but to be improved… Everybody including ordinary earners are going to have to pay more tax.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
** 13 May 2010: Member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom This gave him the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and after Ennoblement the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for Life.

==Personal life==
Hammond married Susan Carolyn Williams-Walker on 29 June 1991. They have two daughters and a son and live in Send, Surrey, with another home in London. In 2009, Hammond&#x27;s wealth was estimated at £9 million.

<doc id="434607" wikidata="Q478189" url="?curid=434607" title="Mike Hancock (British politician)">
<text>Michael Thomas Hancock (born 9 July 1946) is a British politician. He was most recently an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Portsmouth South.

Hancock formally resigned from the Liberal Democrat whip in early June 2014 until a civil court action brought against him by a female constituent alleging improper conduct was resolved. An out-of-court settlement with the woman, known only as &#x27;Annie&#x27;, was reached later in June 2014 in which Hancock admitted that he &quot;crossed the line&quot; into inappropriate behaviour. Hancock&#x27;s resignation was announced on 18 September 2014.

He stood as an independent candidate in the 2014 Portsmouth City Council elections and lost his seat in Fratton Ward to UKIP candidate Julie Swan. The Liberal Democrats lost overall control of the council.
While still an MP, Hancock stood again as an independent candidate for Fratton Ward in the 2015 Portsmouth City Council elections this time coming 6th, with the Liberal Democrat candidate Dave Ashmore taking the seat.

Hancock was previously the Member of Parliament for Portsmouth South for the SDP following a by-election in 1984 until 1987.

==Early life==
Hancock was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, the son of a Portsmouth naval stoker, growing up on a Portsmouth council estate. He was educated at comprehensive schools in Portsmouth. He worked as an engineer until he was first elected to Parliament, and in the years between his parliamentary career he worked as both a director of the Daytime Club at the BBC and as a district officer for Mencap.

==Political career==
Hancock joined the Labour Party in 1968, and was elected as a councillor to Portsmouth City Council in 1971. He left the Labour Party and joined the new Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981, becoming the leader of the council in 1989. He continued in this role until his second election to the House of Commons, and remained a member for Fratton on the city council until 22 May 2014, when he was defeated. He was also elected to Hampshire County Council in 1973, becoming the leader of the Labour group on the council in 1977 until he left the party, leading the council as a Liberal Democrat between 1993 and 1997, when the creation of Portsmouth Unitary Authority meant that he was no longer eligible to stand.

He contested Portsmouth South for the SDP at the 1983 general election but lost to the sitting Conservative MP Bonner Pink by 12,335 votes. Pink died on 6 May 1984, and Hancock was elected after being a candidate, again for the SDP, at the by-election by 1,341 votes. In his book &quot;Time To Declare&quot;, the SDP leader David Owen claimed that Hancock&#x27;s victory prevented a Liberal attempt to subsume the SDP before the 1987 general election. However, Hancock later lost his seat in the 1987 general election to the Conservative David Martin by just 205 votes. He narrowly lost the seat to Martin again at the 1992 general election, this time by just 242 votes. He also contested the European Parliament seat of Wight and Hampshire South in 1994. He returned to parliament at the 1997 general election, defeating Martin by 4,327 votes and held the seat for the Liberal Democrats at each subsequent general election.

He was promoted to the frontbench by Paddy Ashdown in 1997 as the spokesman on foreign and commonwealth affairs until 2000, when he was moved by Charles Kennedy to speak on the environment, transport and the regions, but following the 2001 general election, Hancock returned to the backbenches.

It was reported that he signed nomination forms for more than one candidate in the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership election, in order to ensure a &#x27;proper contest&#x27;.

On 29 March 2015, Hancock announced he would run again in Portsmouth South, this time as an independent candidate. Hancock failed to win the election, as did the official Liberal Democrat candidate; the constituency was gained by the Conservative Party.

===Committee membership===
He was member of both the defence select committee from 1999 to 2011 and has been on the Speaker&#x27;s panel of chairmen since 1999. He is the vice-chairman of the all party groups on Croatia, and Russia.

He was previously chair of the Russia group, until being succeeded by Labour&#x27;s Chris Bryant, because he was felt to be too lenient towards Moscow: &quot;We were concerned by Mike Hancock&#x27;s pro-Putin and pro-Medvedev position. That is why I stood against him and ousted him. His research assistant, who provided secretarial support to the group, was incensed and walked out.&quot;

Hancock holds various positions on the Council of Europe, including a committee position on the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of Europe (Monitoring Committee).

On 18 October 2011, amidst espionage allegations relating to his aide and mistress Katia Zatuliveter, Hancock resigned from his post on the defence select committee. (See below)

===Political views and stances===

Hancock has said that he will act to defend the government of Azerbaijan in the British Parliament. He says that he disapproves of criticism of President Ilham Aliyev&#x27;s regime, and has stated that, in particular, he disapproves of the democratic opposition movement within Azerbaijan. In 2013, he voted against a critical report on political prisoners in Azerbaijan.

Hancock has stated that he does not believe the Armenian genocide actually happened, describing it as a &quot;so-called genocide&quot; based on &quot;dubious historical&quot; claims; in March 2010, he said: &quot;Armenia is like a headless chicken that runs around in circles. They really do not know where to run.&quot;

Hancock is a patron of the Captive Animals Protection Society, a charity campaigning for an end to the use of animals in entertainment, including circuses, zoos, the exotic pet trade and the audio-visual industry.

Hancock is a supporter of homoeopathy, having signed several early day motions in support of its continued funding on the National Health Service.

==Russian aide&#x27;s arrest, espionage allegation and extra-marital affair==

On 8 August 2010, one of Hancock&#x27;s parliamentary aides, Russian national Katia Zatuliveter, and her friend were questioned at Gatwick Airport on returning from celebrating her 25th birthday in Croatia. Hancock had met Zatuliveter in Strasbourg where she worked for the Council of Europe. She started working as an aide to Hancock in 2008, after having been an intern at the House of Commons for a while and undergoing security vetting. Until Hancock was ousted as chairman of the All-Party Group on Russia in June 2010, Zatuliveter had been the group&#x27;s secretary, giving her direct access to all MPs with the greatest interest in Russia and legitimate reason to liaise with the Russian authorities; according to sources at Westminster, Zatuliveter had access to Hancock&#x27;s private emails, and virtually ran the UK-Russia group.

Reportedly, Zatuliveter had been identified by MI5 (UK Security Service) when surveillance linked her to another person with close links to the Russian embassy in London; the latter was suspected of working for the SVR, Russia&#x27;s foreign intelligence service.

On 4 December 2010, it was reported that Zatuliveter was facing deportation in Yarl&#x27;s Wood Immigration Removal Centre, after she was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Service on behalf of MI5 and the Border and Immigration Agency on 2 December 2010, on suspicion of espionage, the police action having been approved by Home Secretary Theresa May. The incident happened in the wake of the uncovering and expulsion of ten Russian sleeper agents in the US in June 2010, including a young woman who had British citizenship, Anna Chapman.

On 5 December 2010, Hancock confirmed the detention of Zatuliveter and advised the media that she was appealing against her potential deportation. In subsequent interviews on the same day, he called the espionage accusations &quot;absolutely ludicrous&quot; commenting further: &quot;I have no reason to believe she did anything but act honourably during the time she was working for me. She is determined to fight her corner and she genuinely believes, and I back her 100%, that she has nothing to hide and has done nothing wrong. If she has, the (security) services are right. But they need to prove their point now.&quot;

The media quoted some of Hancock&#x27;s former Council of Europe&#x27;s liberal group colleagues as saying that in the 2000s Hancock would usually come to their regular private gatherings alongside a series of young Russian and Ukrainian women – in spite of protests by some of those; Hancock&#x27;s former colleagues said they had witnessed his assistants using the computers of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the liberal group secretariat, which were supposed to be protected by a password; apparently his assistants knew the password. Hancock denied claims by Mátyás Eörsi that he had failed to declare all of his visits to Russia, saying that he did not know exactly how many trips he had made to Russia, as his passport had &quot;fallen into the sea&quot;. It was also reported that Hancock had allegedly agreed to help another Russian national, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the late 1990s.

On 7 December 2010 Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry described the affair as &quot;vaudeville based on a threadbare spy plot&quot; being whipped up by the UK media, which could &quot;only be regarded with pity&quot;.

On 9 December 2010, Katerina Zatuliveter filed an appeal against arrest and deportation to Russia; in a statement released by her lawyer Tessa Gregory, Zatuliveter said British authorities had failed to provide evidence of her work not being &quot;conducive to national security&quot;; of MI5 she said: &quot;I fully cooperated with them when they questioned me. I have nothing to hide and was only doing my job as a parliamentary researcher.&quot; Also on that day, Alexander Sternik, Russia&#x27;s chargé d&#x27;affaires said of Hancock: &quot;Mike Hancock is one of those people who are known to have a balanced objective and sympathetic approach towards the modern Russia and its foreign policy.&quot; Sternik also said that the Russian view of the affair was that Hancock was being targeted because he was a parliamentarian who &quot;showed sympathy and understanding for the modern Russian state&quot;; of Zatuliver&#x27;s detention he said: &quot;We have not received, although we insisted on this, any clarification as to the motives and the reasons that this detention was made.&quot;

At a Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) hearing on her case begun on 18 October 2011, Zatuliveter admitted to having had a four-year affair with Hancock. She also admitted that she had had affairs with a NATO official, a Dutch diplomat and a senior UN official.

On 29 November 2011, the SIAC delivered its ruling that allowed the appeal; the SIAC&#x27;s Open Judgment concluded: &quot;Our conclusion, at least on the balance of probabilities, is that she was and is not a Russian agent. [...]&quot; The 2011 SIAC&#x27;s ruling on Zatuliveter&#x27;s appeal noted of her relationship with him: &quot;The relationship with Mr Hancock was enduring and genuine on both sides.&quot;

==Indecent assault claim==
In October 2010 a complaint was made against Hancock of indecent assault, which Hampshire Police announced would not be pursued in December 2010 due to insufficient evidence.

In February 2013, a civil suit against Hancock over the same complaint was filed.

In September 2013 the police reopened their investigation, asking that a report for Portsmouth City Council, be handed over. Hancock was then still a Portsmouth councillor, as well as an MP for the city. The report was an investigation into whether Hancock had breached the Councillors Code of Conduct for Portsmouth City Council, the council suspended any action as a result of the report until all other proceedings have concluded. The Police decided after considering the report that Hancock would face no charges in relation to the complaint.

In January 2014, Hancock was suspended from the Liberal Democrats after the party nationally reviewed the report commissioned by Liberal Democrat run Portsmouth City Council which had found &quot;prima facie evidence of his unwelcome sexual approaches&quot; to his constituent. The report, which has not been officially published, had become available to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in December 2013.

The civil case was scheduled to come to trial in mid-June 2014, but a settlement between the parties emerged on 11 June. A week later, when details of the out of court settlement became public knowledge, Hancock apologised to his constituent (known only under the pseudonym of Annie) via a statement issued by the complainant&#x27;s solicitors at the High Court in London. Any compensation paid to the complainant was not made publicly known. In part, his statement says: &quot;I understand that you felt degraded. I did not treat you with sufficient respect. I made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against, and I crossed the line.&quot; A psychiatric report on Hancock, who was undergoing treatment at the Priory Hospital in Southampton, confirmed that he was freely able to make such a statement. Hancock resigned from the Liberal Democrats in September 2014 before a disciplinary hearing. The news was disclosed in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 18 September.

==Personal life==
Hancock has been married to Jacqueline Elliott (also a former member of Portsmouth City Council until losing her seat in the 2014 elections) since 1967, and has a son and a daughter.

He has been the chairman of the southern region of the NSPCC since 1989 and has been the vice-chairman of Portsmouth Dock since 1992. He was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the same year.

<doc id="434611" wikidata="Q773876" url="?curid=434611" title="Evan Harris">
<text>Evan Leslie Harris (born 21 October 1965) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford West and Abingdon from 1997 to 2010, losing his seat in the 2010 general election by 176 votes to Conservative Nicola Blackwood.

Since 2011 he has been the joint executive director of Hacked Off, the campaign for an accountable press.

==Early life and career==
Evan Harris was born on 21 October 1965 in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of South African Jewish parents (his father was a medical professor). He was brought up in Liverpool, where he had a state education at the Liverpool Blue Coat School. In 1984 he won a scholarship to the independent Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, California, and later won a scholarship to attend Wadham College, Oxford, where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in physiology and a diploma in medical sociology. He completed his education at the Oxford Medical School, where he graduated BM BCh and qualified as a physician in 1991.

Harris began his career at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in 1991 as a Pre-Registration House Officer (junior doctor). A year later, he moved to the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, specialising in acute medicine and surgery. In 1994 Harris moved to Oxfordshire Health Authority, becoming an honorary specialist registrar in public health and working on issues to do with NHS staffing and training. Harris held the position of local British Medical Association representative and negotiator from 1992 to 1994, following which he was elected to the BMA&#x27;s National Council.

Harris is a humanist, and a patron of Humanists UK. He was also a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, before being unseated at the 2010 general election. In addition, he is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society, and the Patron of the Oxford Secular Society.

Harris lists his interests as football, bridge and chess.

==Political career==

===Election to Parliament===
He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for Oxford West and Abingdon. The seat had previously been held by Conservative John Patten, a former Cabinet minister. Harris gained the seat for the Liberal Democrats with a majority of 6,285, making his maiden speech on 21 May 1997, and remained the MP there until 2010.

===Promotion to the frontbench===
In parliament, he was made a frontbench spokesman on Health in 1997 by Paddy Ashdown. Following the election of Charles Kennedy as party leader in 1999, Harris became spokesman on Higher Education and Women&#x27;s issues. He was promoted to the Liberal Democrat shadow cabinet following the 2001 general election as Shadow Secretary of State for Health, but stood down in 2003 to care for his girlfriend Liz O&#x27;Hara who had been diagnosed with terminal glioblastoma multiforme. Following the 2005 general election, Harris returned to the frontbench team as spokesman on Science, a position he held until his defeat in the 2010 general election.

Harris was a member of the education and employment select committee between 1999 and 2001. He was then a member of the select committees for science and technology between 2003 and 2010, and for human rights between 2005 and 2010.

Evan Harris is a member of the centre-left Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats, and was Honorary President of the Liberal Democrats Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender equality organisation (LGBT+ Liberal Democrats) from 2000 to 2012.

In parliament, he served on many party groups, including the kidney group (as chairman); mental health; science; refugees; equality; and AIDS group.

===Expenses===
Harris was initially alleged to have profited from the sale of his second home by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; during the expenses scandal. However, following Harris&#x27;s response, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; withdrew its allegations. Sir Thomas Legg, the auditor brought in by the House of Commons, wrote to Harris to say that there were no problems with his expenses.

===Campaigns===
Harris is pro-choice on abortion, and supports the right of mentally competent, terminally ill people to take their own lives under certain circumstances. This has led to criticism from pro-life and Church leaders, such as George Pitcher.

Harris has also spoken in support of medical research involving animals, including that carried out at Oxford University. Notably, he joined Pro-Test&#x27;s Oxford march in February 2008. This led animal rights activist Keith Mann to stand against Harris in the 2010 general election, during which he referred to Harris as &quot;Dr Death&quot;.

Harris is a vocal backer of reform of defamation laws in the United Kingdom. He notably supported Simon Singh in his libel case against the British Chiropractic Association, saying &quot;For every Simon Singh who wins there are hundreds of writers who never dare publish or who give up their legal battle because they cannot risk the cost of losing. That is why all the political parties must be held to their promises take action [to reform defamation law]&quot;. In 2009, Evan Harris was awarded (with Lord Avebury) the National Secular Society&#x27;s Secularist of the Year Award in recognition of his role in the abolition of the common law offence of blasphemous libel.

===Defeat in 2010 general election===
In the 2010 general election, Harris was defeated by the Conservative candidate Nicola Blackwood. Harris received 23,730 votes to Blackwood&#x27;s 23,906 – a margin of 176 votes.
This equated to a 6.9% swing from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives. Several political commentators commented that this was one of the most surprising results of the general election – given Harris&#x27; high-profile position as a shadow minister and the size of his existing majority.

====Pre-election campaign====
For a number of years before the 2010 general election Harris&#x27; views on various social and theological matters had led to criticism within certain parts of the media. Christian conservatives criticised Harris, including Damian Thompson and Cristina Odone.

In the final weeks of the 2010 campaign, leaflets were distributed by Keith Mann, a candidate for the Animal Protection Party, attacking Harris as &#x27;Dr Death&#x27;, and criticising him for his support for animal testing, abortion, secularisation, and other issues. Further leaflets were distributed by the unaffiliated Reverend Lynda Rose, also referring to Harris as &#x27;Dr Death&#x27;, and criticising him for his secularism, support for abortion, embryo research and assisted suicide.

In contrast to these criticisms, Harris received support from a number of humanist and atheist figures, including Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh and Dave Gorman. Stephen Fry added his support, saying of Harris: &quot;[Harris is] by far and away the most persuasive and impressive parliamentarian in the cause of good and open science and enquiry that we have had in the past decade. He has been central to mould-breaking and inspirational multiparty cooperation in issues of scientific concern since 1997.&quot;

====Boundary changes====
Before the 2010 general election, Harris&#x27;s seat of Oxford West and Abingdon had its boundaries changed, moving the central Oxford wards of Carfax and Holywell, composed primarily of students of the University of Oxford, to the Oxford East constituency. In return the constituency gained a ward each from Wantage and Witney. These changes reduced Harris&#x27; notional majority from 7683 to 5525 votes, or 11.3%.

====Reactions to election defeat====
Responses to the election result varied. Harris&#x27; defeat was lamented by a number of commentators as a &#x27;loss for science&#x27;.
However, Harris&#x27; defeat was also celebrated by some conservative Christians, including Christian Concern For Our Nation, and George Pitcher who described it as &quot;the best result of the election&quot;.

Richard Dawkins, posting on his site, wondered whether the religious criticisms of Harris had &quot;caused Evan Harris to lose votes&quot; or &quot;gain them&quot;, noting that the answer to this would reflect the true extent of secular thought in Britain. Post-election analysis in the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; suggested that Harris&#x27; strident secular opinions appeared to have &quot;alienated a sufficiently large percentage of the electorate to lose what was considered a relatively safe seat for the Liberal Democrats&quot;. It detailed that while the Liberal Democrats had nationally gained a 1% swing in their favour, in the Oxford West constituency there had been a 6.9% swing away from the party to the Conservatives. Although 2001 census figures show that Oxford had the 10th highest proportion of people in England and Wales who listed themselves as having no religion, the census also showed that 76.1% of those surveyed did not class themselves as having no religion.

===Career after 2010 general election defeat===
From August 2010 Harris has been writing a blog on science policy for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. On 18 September 2010, Harris had an article published on &quot;The Guardian&quot; website called &#x27;A secularist manifesto&#x27;. This was in turn critiqued by Jonathan Chaplin, who wrote that &#x27;the manifesto contains troubling elements, which serve to undermine his professed support for the right to manifest religious belief.&#x27;

On 17 November 2010, Harris was elected as one of the three vice-chairs on the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Federal Policy Committee.

<text>Sir Nicholas Barton Harvey (born 3 August 1961) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was the member of parliament (MP) for North Devon from 1992 to 2015 and the Minister of State for the Armed Forces from 2010 to 2012.

==Early life and education==
Harvey was born in Chandler&#x27;s Ford, Hampshire, and was educated at Queen&#x27;s College, an independent school in the county town of Taunton in Somerset. He then attended the Middlesex Polytechnic at Enfield where he was awarded a BA degree in business studies in 1983. He was the president of the students&#x27; union from 1981 to 1982.

==Early career==
He joined Profil PR Ltd in 1984 as a communications and marketing executive, before being appointed by the public relations firm Dewe Rogerson (now known as Citigate Dewe Rogerson) as a marketing executive in 1986. He worked as a communications consultant from 1991 until his election to parliament.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected as the vice-chairman of the Union of Liberal Students for a year in 1981.

<doc id="434614" wikidata="Q68771" url="?curid=434614" title="Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">
<text>Prince Frederick Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (; 26 December 1737 – 26 February 1815) was a military commander in the army of the Holy Roman Empire. He began his career at the age of 18 in a cavalry regiment with which he took part in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Coburg&#x27;s bravery allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks. Promoted to colonel in 1759, he became a general officer in the following years and, in this capacity, took command of an army corps during the Austro-Turkish War. Coburg campaigned successfully in Moldavia where he won the battles of Focşani, Rymnik and Martinestje against the Ottomans, which earned him the rank of field marshal in 1789.

Thanks to his extensive experience, Coburg was appointed supreme commander of the Imperial Army in the Austrian Netherlands at the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars. He triumphed at the Battle of Aldenhoven, then at the Battle of Neerwinden in March 1793, but these victories were overshadowed some time later by his defeat at the Battle of Wattignies. In 1794, Coburg was defeated by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan at the Battle of Fleurus and had to abandon the Austrian Netherlands to the French. He was relieved of his command following this setback and retired to his lands in Coburg. Coburg was also &quot;Inhaber&quot; (owner) of a dragoon regiment from 1769 to 1802 and of an infantry regiment from 1802 to 1815.

==Biography==
Frederick Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was born in Coburg on the night of 26 to 27 December 1737. He was the youngest child of Duke Franz Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Princess Anna Sophie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. He joined the Army of the Holy Roman Empire on 4 January 1756 as a &quot;Rittmeister&quot; in the 33rdCuirassier Regiment &quot;Anspach&quot;. Coburg, then aged 18, first saw action in the Seven Years&#x27; War, in which he distinguished himself. He fought at the battles of Lobositz, Prague and Hochkirch, where he was seriously wounded, then at Landshut and Liegnitz. In the meantime, Coburg was promoted to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; on 16 April 1758 and to &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel) on 16 January 1759.

After the end of hostilities, Coburg was successively promoted to Major-General on 30 July 1766, to &quot;Feldmarschall-Leutnant&quot; on 1 May 1773 and to &quot;General der Kavallerie&quot; on 22 August 1786, in addition to the post of military governor of Galicia and Bukovina. He also became &quot;Inhaber&quot; (owner) of the 37th Dragoon Regiment in 1769. Coburg then fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession from 1778 to 1779. In 1788, he was sent to the Ottoman front at the head of an army corps and invaded Moldavia. After a series of victorious against Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s army, Coburg laid siege to Khotyn on 15 May. The city capitulated on 16 September, delivering a large amount of equipment to the Imperials.

Coburg followed up his success and, with the help of General Suvorov&#x27;s Russian troops, defeated the Ottomans at Battle of Focşani on 21 July 1789. Knighted in the Military Order of Maria Theresa, he scored another victory over the Turks at the Battle of Rymnik on 22 September, and emerged victorious at Martinestje the following day. Following this engagement, Coburg was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; on 3 October. He then set out to conquer Wallachia and seized Bucharest, where he was enthusiastically welcomed by the population. He concluded his campaign with the capture of Orșova in April 1790.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
====Early victories in Belgium and France====

In February 1793, Coburg was made &quot;Reichsgeneralfeldmarschall&quot;, a rank confirmed to him by decree on 8 April, and commander-in-chief of the imperial army in the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium). The Holy Roman Empire was then taking part in the War of the First Coalition against Revolutionary France. On 1 March, Coburg attacked the French reserve corps under the command of General at Aldenhoven; charged by the imperial cavalry, the revolutionary troops were routed, losing 2,300 men, seven cannons and two flags. Two days later, the French abandoned the Siege of Maastricht. On 18 March, Coburg clashed with the French army of General Charles François Dumouriez at the Battle of Neerwinden. The forces were balanced at around 40,000 men on each side. In a defensive position, the prince divided his army into three groups: Archduke Charles on the right, Colloredo and the Duke of Württemberg in the center and finally Clerfayt on the left with the reserves. The French attacked in the morning, pushed back the left flank of the Imperials and took Neerwinden, but Clerfayt managed to restore the situation and recaptured the village after a fierce fight. Despite continuous assaults, Dumouriez failed to break through Coburg&#x27;s lines. He ordered a retreat on the morning of 19 March, after losing 5,000 men and 30 cannons against 2,800 Austrian casualties.

The victory at Neerwinden opened the way into Belgium to Coburg&#x27;s army. At this stage, the prince was in favour of a diplomatic agreement with France to end the war, even going so far as to declare: &quot;I am the ally of all friends of order, ready to renounce all projects of conquest carried out in the name of emperors&quot;. Harshly reprimanded by the government in Vienna, he was nevertheless forced into action. The Coalition forces, comprising the imperial army and the British-Hanoverian corps, to which was added a Dutch contingent, then totalled 118,000 men under Coburg&#x27;s command. He quickly besieged Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut and Valenciennes, which capitulated in July 1793, creating a breach in the French defensive system. In parallel with the siege operations, Coburg won the battles of Raismes on 8 May and Famars on 23 May. He then obtained the surrender of Le Quesnoy on 13 September, but his allies failed to take Dunkirk. The strategic situation nevertheless remained very favourable to the Coalition: &quot;only Maubeuge [...] remained in the hands of the French. However, if it fell in turn, a large breach would open up in the border protection system. Nothing would stop Coburg&#x27;s army from marching on Paris and, then, only a battle in the open countryside would make it possible to redress the situation&quot;.

====Defeats at Wattignies and Fleurus====

While Cambrai and Bouchain, lacking garrisons, were at Coburg&#x27;s mercy, the commander of the imperial army chose first to take Maubeuge, which he placed under siege on 30 September 1793. General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, the new commander-in-chief of the French Army of the North, pressed by the Committee of Public Safety, decided to go on the offensive to defeat Coburg&#x27;s forces and relieve Maubeuge. The imperial army took up position on the heights of Wattignies, which the prince had fortified and equipped with artillery. Confident in his chances of success, the prince declared: &quot;if they get here, I&#x27;ll become a &quot;sans-culotte&quot;!&quot;, though the phrase is possibly apocryphal. The Battle of Wattignies began on 15 October. French attacks followed one another all day long but were repelled on the right, left and centre, to the point that Coburg believed the battle had been won. However, the fighting resumed the next day with the same intensity; led by Jourdan and representative on mission Carnot, the French took control of the field despite the efforts of Coburg&#x27;s troops. Reinforced late by the Duke of York, Coburg ordered a retreat behind the Sambre and lifted the Siege of Maubeuge. His army went into winter quarters shortly afterwards and remained inactive until the following year.

In April 1794, Coburg launched an offensive against the fortress of Landrecies which, according to the Coalition strategy, was to serve as a concentration point for the Allied armies before they began the march on Paris. Coburg had around 100,000 men at his disposal for this campaign, divided between the forces of the Count of Kaunitz on the left, his own in the centre and those of the Count of Clerfayt on the right. Having recently arrived at the army headquarters in Valenciennes, Emperor Francis II himself led the whole operation, thus replacing Coburg as supreme commander of the Coalition forces. Landrecies, after a brief siege, capitulated on 30 April 1794 despite General Pichegru&#x27;s attempts to relieve it. The rivalries and lack of coordination between the generals, however, affected the cohesion of the Allied high command. Coburg was severely defeated at the Battle of Tourcoing on 18 May, leaving 5,500 casualties and six cannons on the battlefield. Mack, his chief of staff, who before the battle had talked about &quot;exterminating&quot; the French army, was replaced. The prince won a rematch a few days later at the Battle of Tournai where he forced Pichegru to retreat after inflicting 6,000 casualties on his army. The Emperor returned to Vienna on June 13, allowing Coburg to resume overall command of operations.

Coburg then faced two French armies, soon to be reinforced by a third under the command of Jourdan. On 12 May, the French general had already succeeded in expelling Beaulieu from the town of Arlon; then, pushing back Kaunitz&#x27;s corps, Jourdan&#x27;s troops crossed the Sambre and laid siege to Charleroi. Faced with the urgency of the situation, Kaunitz requested the support of Coburg. The latter, after several days of forced marches, finally arrived near the city on 26 June and immediately prepared to go to battle, unaware that Charleroi had surrendered to the besiegers the day before. The French forces entrenched themselves on the heights of Fleurus, with Kléber at Trazegnies, Championnet at Heppignies and the Marceau and Lefebvre divisions at Lambusart. Supervising the operations on the left wing himself, Coburg delegated command of the center to General Quasdanovich and of the right wing to the Prince of Orange. The Allied attacks were however carried out without any coordination. Orange struck first but was held in check in front of Trazegnies; Quasdanovich then managed to briefly control Heppignies before being driven out by a combined counterattack by Jourdan&#x27;s and Championnet&#x27;s troops. Finally, Coburg engaged last with the right column with which he headed towards Lambusart. The Marceau division was quickly overwhelmed by superior numbers and it took the intervention of Lefebvre, then of the reserves commanded by Jourdan, to drive the Imperials out of the area. Held in check on the entire front, and informed in the meantime of the capitulation of Charleroi, Coburg decided to retreat. Both armies suffered around 5,000 casualties.

Coburg&#x27;s defeat at Fleurus led to the loss of Brussels on 10 July and, in a few months, of all of Belgium. On the 16 July, shortly after the fall of Namur, he was defeated by Jourdan one last time near Leuven. Following this final setback, Coburg asked to be relieved of his command and blamed the defeat on his subordinates, whom he accused of having deliberately caused the campaign to fail in order to intrigue against him. The prince was dismissed from his duties on 9 August 1794 and was replaced on 1 September by the Count of Clerfayt. He then retired to his lands in Cobourg where he died on 26 February 1815, at the age of 77.

==Family==
Coburg married morganatically Therese Stroffeck in 1789. Their son Friedrich (1789–1873) was unable to claim his father&#x27;s titles but was made Baron of Rohmann (&quot;Freiherr von Rohmann&quot;). Frederick Josias was the younger brother of (1730–1797), who also served the Imperial Army, reaching the rank of Major-General. His nephew, Louis Charles Frederick of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1755–1806), became a &quot;Feldmarschall-Leutnant&quot; in 1796. Coburg was the great-uncle of King Leopold I of Belgium and the great-great-uncle of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="434617" wikidata="Q478319" url="?curid=434617" title="Tom Harris (British politician)">
<text>Thomas Harris (born 20 February 1964) is a British journalist and former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow South, formerly Glasgow Cathcart, from 2001 to 2015. A former member of Scottish Labour, he left the party in August 2018. Since 2021 he has been lead non-executive director of the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland and Advocate General for Scotland.

Harris first entered government when he was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Transport in September 2006 by PM Tony Blair. When Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in June 2007, Harris kept his junior ministerial role but, in the October 2008 reshuffle, he was sacked and returned to the backbenches. On 9 June 2009, he was the first Scottish Labour MP to call for Gordon Brown to stand down as prime minister.

Harris was a candidate in the 2011 Scottish Labour leadership election, but effectively admitted defeat on 10 December a week before the result was declared. In 2012, he returned to Ed Miliband&#x27;s frontbench as shadow environment minister but left in June 2013 to spend more time with his family, being succeeded by Barry Gardiner.

==Early life and career==
Tom Harris was born in Ayrshire and raised in Beith, Scotland. He was educated at the Garnock Academy in Kilbirnie and Napier College, Edinburgh, where he was awarded an HND in Journalism in 1986. He worked as a trainee newspaper journalist with the &quot;East Kilbride News&quot; in 1986 before joining the &quot;Paisley Daily Express&quot; in 1988.

He was appointed as a press officer with the Scottish Labour Party in 1990, moving to the same position with Strathclyde Regional Council in 1992. He was briefly the senior media officer with the Glasgow City Council in 1996 before joining East Ayrshire Council later in the same year as a public relations manager. In 1998, he became the chief of public relations at the Strathclyde Passenger Executive, where he remained until his election to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Harris joined the Labour Party in 1984. He was active in the Edinburgh South Constituency Labour Party and was elected as the chairman of the Glasgow Cathcart Constituency Labour Party for two years in 1998. During his time at this post, he tried to stop the closure of the ABC Muirend/Toledo cinema, but was unsuccessful.

==Parliamentary career==
Harris was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election for the seat of Glasgow Cathcart following the retirement of the Labour MP John Maxton. He held the seat with a majority of 10,816 and made his maiden speech on 27 June 2001. His seat was abolished following the creation of the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood and the subsequent reduction of Scottish seats at Westminster. He represented the new seat of Glasgow South from the 2005 general election until losing in 2015.

He served on the Science and Technology Select Committee for two years from 2001, and was appointed in 2003 as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, John Spellar. From 2005, he was PPS to the Secretary of State for Health Patricia Hewitt. On 7 September 2006, he replaced Derek Twigg as Parliamentary Under Secretary at the Department for Transport. However, in October 2008 Harris announced on his blog that the Prime Minister had telephoned him to inform him that he would be returning to the back benches.

He is a committed trade unionist and was a member of the National Union of Journalists from 1984 until he joined UNISON in 1997, and has since a member of Unite the Union. He introduced a bill in 2005 for tougher sentences for e-criminals. Also in 2005, he was involved in an argument over the funding of a housing charity which had called for direct action following the eviction and deportation to Albania of a Kosovan family seeking asylum from a flat in Drumchapel. He was a keen supporter of John Smith and is reported to have been more of a Blairite than a Brownite. He wrote a popular blog from 2007 to 2010, which has won a number of awards and in 2011 published a book containing excerpts from it, entitled &quot;Why I&#x27;m Right and Everyone Else Is Wrong&quot;. In the 2009, Top Political Blog Awards run by &quot;Total Politics&quot; magazine, it was voted top MP&#x27;s blog, top Scottish blog and top left-of-centre blog, and was ranked number 8 overall. He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

On 6 December 2010, he appeared on the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; programme to criticise protesters who had intimidated ordinary shoppers using Topshop and Vodafone in the run-up to Christmas and suggested that corporate tax avoidance could be prevented by a change in tax regulations. In 2011, he actively campaigned against the Alternative Vote in the referendum that year.

Harris was forced to stand down from his role as Scottish Labour&#x27;s internet adviser on 16 January 2012, following adverse media reaction to his posting of a &quot;Downfall&quot; parody on YouTube ridiculing First Minister Alex Salmond.

In August 2011 Harris expressed an interest, and in September 2011 confirmed on Twitter he was standing in the election to be the next leader of the Scottish Labour Party, after the publication of the Murphy and Boyack review. He described the Scottish Labour Party as having had &quot;no new ideas in 12 years [of devolution]&quot;, and that it must become a &quot;party of aspiration&quot; or it risked becoming irrelevant in the next few years. Harris was the only MP to enter the race and said Labour had become &quot;too closely associated with the public sector&quot;, rather than being &quot;a party of business&quot;. He also said the &quot;Scottish Labour party was really in deep trouble and that we need to think outside the box. There is no indication that the party is prepared to do that yet and I don&#x27;t know why&quot;.

Harris considered standing in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, but announced via his podcast in May 2012 that he had given up this ambition and was committed to stand in his Glasgow South constituency at the United Kingdom general election of 2015. In 2015, he lost his seat to Stewart McDonald of the SNP.

==Post-Parliament career==
Since losing his seat, Harris has set up a public affairs company called Third Avenue Public Affairs Ltd and, as of 2019, is senior counsel for the Edinburgh-based media and political relations consultancy Message Matters. He is also an associate consultant with Peterborough-based public affairs company Cogitamus Ltd. In March 2016, he replaced Dan Hodges as a daily commentator for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

The same month, Harris became the new director of the Scottish branch of Vote Leave, the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. Although a Eurosceptic, Harris said he had originally intended to vote to stay in; however, he found David Cameron&#x27;s renegotiation of Britain&#x27;s membership unsatisfactory, denouncing it as, &quot;a few minor changes of emphasis on the fringes of EU policy&quot; and decided to vote to leave. Harris has continued to speak out in favour of Brexit in his newspaper columns since 2016.

In 2016, Harris was a member of the advisory board of the Reform Scotland think tank, and declared himself a &quot;self-confessed Blairite&quot;.

In March 2018, &quot;Ten Years In The Death of the Labour Party&quot;, written by Harris, was published by Biteback. In August, he announced his resignation from the Labour Party in an op-ed for &quot;The Daily Telegraph.&quot; In November 2019, he announced he would be voting for the Conservatives at the 2019 general election. Harris further admitted on the edition of 29 July 2020 of the &quot;Iain Dale All Talk&quot; podcast that this was not the first time he had voted Conservative, having done so two years earlier as well.

In October 2018, Harris was appointed to the Expert Challenge Panel, supporting Keith Williams in his wide-ranging review of the British railway industry. , the review has yet to be published. In July 2020, Harris was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of HS2 Ltd.

On 20 October 2021, Harris took on a job for three years as an adviser to the Conservative government on Scottish issues, as lead non-executive director of both the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland and Advocate General for Scotland. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to have been appointed to this role and I&#x27;m looking forward to contributing to the effective work of the UK Government in Scotland. This is an exciting time to be involved in advising and helping ministers deliver for the whole country.&quot;

==Personal life==
Harris married Carolyn Moffat in 1998; the couple have two sons. He has another son from an earlier marriage, which was dissolved in 1996. A Christian, he enjoys astronomy and badminton. Harris is a fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and is friends with its former showrunner, Steven Moffat. Harris contributed to &quot;Behind The Sofa&quot;, the collection of celebrity &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan memories published by Gollancz in 2013. He firmly opposed a female actor playing the Doctor. In 2019, he launched a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; podcast, &quot;The Power of 3&quot;, alongside fellow fans Kenny Smith and David Steel.

<doc id="434619" wikidata="Q7027270" url="?curid=434619" title="Nick Hawkins (politician)">
<text>Nicholas John Hawkins (born 27 March 1957) is a barrister and politician from the United Kingdom. He was a Conservative Party Member of Parliament from 1992 to 2005.

==Early life==
Hawkins was educated at Bedford Modern School and Lincoln College, Oxford, and called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1979.

==Parliamentary career==
Having stood unsuccessfully in Huddersfield in 1987, Hawkins became a Member of Parliament representing the constituency of Blackpool South in 1992. Prior to the 1997 general election, with polls predicting that the Conservatives had no chance of retaining the Blackpool South seat, Hawkins applied and was selected to contest the newly created constituency of Surrey Heath, predicted to be one of the safest Conservative seats in the country. He duly won the seat with a majority 16,287, the second-largest Conservative majority in the country that year (after John Major in Huntingdon). Hawkins was re-elected in 2001 with a reduced majority of 10,819.

Hawkins served in Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s government in 1995–97, first at the Ministry of Defence and then at the then Department of National Heritage. In opposition, he was appointed and promoted in a series of shadow ministerial jobs by four different Conservative Party leaders. Among other roles, he was Shadow Solicitor-General in 2003, a Shadow Home Office Minister on national security issues and drugs policy, Shadow Legal and Constitutional Affairs Minister, and Shadow spokesman on gambling twice (2000–01 and 2003–04).

===Deselection===
In April 2004, Hawkins was deselected as the Surrey Heath Conservative Association&#x27;s parliamentary candidate, following a postal ballot of its 1,200 members in the constituency. His difficulties had begun when he left his wife for a Conservative county councillor in 1999, when a first attempt to deselect him had been defused by Michael Ancram. The decision to drop Hawkins as the Surrey Heath candidate was taken despite appeals on his behalf by Oliver Letwin, William Hague, Ann Widdecombe, and others. The party&#x27;s leader at the time, Michael Howard, chose not to veto the association&#x27;s decision.

Hawkins was encouraged by Howard and party co-chairman Liam Fox to stand again for a different constituency, but he decided instead to return to his legal career. He remained a Member of Parliament until the 2005 general election. Michael Gove, a journalist at &quot;The Times&quot;, was selected as the new Conservative candidate for Surrey Heath in his place, and retained the seat.

==After Parliament==
After leaving parliament, Hawkins returned to his legal career as a corporate lawyer; he had previously been a barrister on circuit. He had also worked as in-house corporate counsel in banking, insurance, financial services and credit in the 1980s and early 1990s, was elected chairman of the national organisation for corporate barristers, The Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry (BACFI), and elected to serve on the General Council of the Bar (Bar Council) for six years and on its &quot;inner cabinet&quot;, the GMC, for two years.

<doc id="434620" wikidata="Q478686" url="?curid=434620" title="John Hayes (British politician)">
<text>Sir John Henry Hayes (born 23 June 1958) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for South Holland and The Deepings since 1997. He has held five ministerial positions and six shadow ministerial positions. Hayes was appointed as a Privy Councillor in April 2013 and a Knight Bachelor in November 2018.

Hayes is considered a social conservative, economic protectionist, communitarian and Eurosceptic. He strongly supported Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU and has spoken regularly about his belief in conservative ideas and philosophy. Hayes is known for speaking passionately and theatrically in the House of Commons chamber and has been described as a &quot;colourful character&quot; who is &quot;popular and influential on the Tory right&quot;.

==Early life and career==
John Hayes was born on 23 June 1958 in Woolwich into a working-class family, where he grew up on a council estate. He was educated at Colfe&#x27;s Grammar School in Lewisham, before studying politics at the University of Nottingham, graduating with a BA and a PGCE in history and English. Hayes was involved in a campaign to create a pipe-smoking society affiliated to the Students&#x27; Union. He also chaired the University&#x27;s Conservative Association from 1981 to 1982 while being President of one of the residential halls, Lincoln&#x27;s Junior Common Room, and served as treasurer of the university&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union from 1982 to 1983.

Hayes suffered a serious head injury in his early 20s, from which he has never fully recovered. He has focused much of his career on raising funds for research into acquired brain injury and support for those who suffer from it.

After university, he was a sales director for The Data Base Ltd, an information technology company based in Nottingham.

== Political career ==
Hayes was elected to Nottinghamshire County Council in 1985 where he was the Conservative Group Spokesman on Education and Chairman of its Campaigns Committee. He served on the council for 13 years. 

At the 1987 general election, Hayes stood as the Conservative candidate in Derbyshire North East, coming second with 37.7% of the vote behind the Labour candidate Harry Barnes. He again stood in Derbyshire North East at the 1992 general election, coming second with 38.2% of the vote behind Harry Barnes.

==Parliamentary career==
Hayes was elected to Parliament as MP for South Holland and The Deepings at the 1997 general election with 49.3% of the vote and a majority of 7,991. He made his maiden speech on 2 July 1997. He was re-elected as MP for South Holland and the Deepings at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 55.4% and an increased majority of 11,099. At the 2005 general election, Hayes was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 57.1% and an increased majority of 15,780. He was again re-elected at the 2010 general election with an increased vote share of 59.1% and an increased majority of 21,880.

In November 2012, during his time as Energy Minister, Hayes clashed with Liberal Democrat coalition partners when he said that there should be no further construction of onshore wind turbines, declaring &quot;enough is enough&quot;.

Following his appointment as Energy Minister in March 2013 Hayes vowed to put &quot;coal back into the coalition&quot;. During his tenure, subsidies for renewables were cut, planning rules for onshore wind were tightened, and a zero-carbon homes policy was scrapped. 

Hayes became Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet Office. He was appointed to the Privy Council on 9 April 2013.

He was appointed as Minister of State at the Department for Transport in the reshuffle on 15 July 2014 with responsibility for national roads, Highways Agency reform, the Infrastructure Bill, and maritime issues.

At the 2015 general election, Hayes was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 59.6% and a decreased majority of 18,567.

Following the general election, Hayes was moved to the Home Office, where he was appointed &quot;Minister of State, Minister for Security&quot;, with responsibility for counter-terrorism, security, serious organised crime and cyber crime.

In the government formed by Theresa May in July 2016, Hayes was reshuffled back to become a Minister at the Department for Transport. 

Hayes was re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with an increased vote share of 69.9% and an increased majority of 24,897.

He resigned from his post as Minister of State for Transport on 9 January 2018 during a cabinet reshuffle.

Hayes, in October 2018, described Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU as something &quot;I&#x27;ve believed in for my whole life&quot;. He stated that voting Leave would provide an opportunity to &quot;finally bring down the curtain on the Blair era&quot;. Following the referendum, Hayes criticised the &quot;stunned hysteria&quot; of an &quot;establishment elite&quot; who had &quot;never before failed to get their own way&quot;.

Also in October 2018, Hayes, a protectionist, rejected &quot;globalist free trade&quot;, stating his belief that government should &quot;redistribute advantage&quot;. He supports tariffs designed to protect &quot;British jobs and British workers&quot;. He criticised the &quot;gig economy&quot; and believes that only &quot;meaningful careers that contribute to societal good&quot; can restore economic opportunities within the local communities they exist to serve. 

Hayes has consistently voted against same-sex marriage and civil partnerships. In line with his socially conservative views, he asserts marriage to be solely the lifetime union of one man and one woman.

In November 2018, Hayes is reported as having asked the UK Government to consider bringing back the death penalty: referencing Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood, he said that: &quot;If he had survived I think most of the British public would have been OK if he had received a fair trial and been put to death – most people would deem that appropriate&quot;. Additionally, Hayes states that, for murder, &quot;I say capital punishment should be a sentence available to the courts but the death penalty should not be mandatory – that&#x27;s always been my position&quot;.

Also in November 2018, Hayes stated his support for constitutional monarchy, voicing his opinion that the monarchy must resist the &quot;culture of celebrity&quot;.

At the 2019 general election, he was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 75.9% and an increased majority of 30,838.

Following an interim report on the connections between colonialism and properties now in the care of the National Trust, including links with historic slavery, Hayes was among the signatories of a letter to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in November 2020 from the group. The letter accused the National Trust of being &quot;coloured by cultural Marxist dogma, colloquially known as the &#x27;woke agenda&#x27;&quot;.

Hayes is the chair of the Common Sense Group, an informal group of conservative politicians and journalists who advocate for the future direction of the Conservative Party and the UK.

In July 2022, he said of precautions for a predicted 40° heatwave: &quot;This is not a brave new world but a cowardly new world where we live in a country where we are frightened of the heat. It is not surprising that in snowflake Britain, the snowflakes are melting&quot;.

Hayes was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 38% and a decreased majority of 6,856.

==Personal life==
Hayes married Susan Hopewell in 1997; they have two sons.

In addition to his seat in Parliament, Hayes holds three outside jobs, with one of them being a strategic adviser to BB Energy, a Dubai-based headquartered energy trading group. Since 2018 Hayes has received payments of £50,000 per year working for a Lebanese-based oil company BB Energy as a strategic adviser which has drawn criticism from Transparency International UK.

==Honours==
Hayes was sworn as a member of the Privy Council on 15 May 2013 at Buckingham Palace.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours for political and public service.

Hayes was knighted in November 2018. This was an honour that was widely reported as bringing the awards system into disrepute; the supposition being that he had been offered and accepted the award in return for support for (or lack of opposition to) the Prime Minister&#x27;s Brexit Draft Withdrawal Agreement. However, he subsequently announced his intention to vote against the proposed withdrawal agreement anyway.

<text>Dame Sylvia Lloyd Heal (&quot;née&quot; Fox; born 20 July 1942) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Halesowen and Rowley Regis from 1997 to 2010, having previously been the MP for Mid Staffordshire from 1990 to 1992. She served as the First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons from 2000 until she stood down from
Parliament in 2010.

==Early life==
Born in Hawarden, Flintshire in north-east Wales, the daughter of Shotton steelworker John Lloyd-Fox and Ruby Hughes, she was educated at the Elfed Secondary Modern School (now Elfed High School) on Mill Lane in Buckley, the Coleg Harlech, and at Swansea University, where she was awarded a BSc in Economics in 1968.

She worked as a medical records clerk at the Chester Royal Infirmary for six years from 1957. In 1968 she was appointed as a social worker with the Department of Employment for two years. For ten years from 1980 she worked as a social worker within a drug rehabilitation centre. During her parliamentary interregnum she worked as a young carers officer with the National Carers Association from 1992 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
She was a member of the Young Socialists National Council for four years from 1960, and was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in 1973. She was first elected to the House of Commons at the Mid Staffordshire by-election on 22 March 1990, which followed the suicide of the sitting Conservative MP John Heddle. She won the seat with a majority of 9,449 on a massive 21% swing from Conservative to Labour in a contest that was fought largely on the single issue of the Poll Tax. She lost the Mid Staffordshire seat two years later at the 1992 general election when she was ousted by the Conservative Michael Fabricant by a majority of 6,236. She was re-elected to Parliament at the 1997 general election for the new West Midlands seat of Halesowen and Rowley Regis with a majority of 10,337 and remained the MP in the 2001 and 2005 general elections.

In her first spell in Parliament she served for two years as a member of the education select committee. She was also promoted to the front bench by Neil Kinnock in 1991 as a spokeswoman for health and women. Following her re-election in 1997 she was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Defence George Robertson and from 1999 his successor Geoff Hoon. She was appointed as a Deputy Speaker of the House in 2000, in which capacity she remained until her retirement from politics.

Sylvia Heal announced on 9 March 2010 that she would be stepping down at the 2010 general election, and was succeeded by Conservative James Morris as MP.

She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for political and public service.

==Personal life==
Heal is the sister of Ann Keen, who was a Labour MP from 1997 to 2010, and sister-in-law to Alan Keen, who was a Labour MP from 1992 until his death in 2011. She lives in Egham, Surrey, and she takes a keen interest in South Africa and enjoys gardening.

At the 1987 general election, Heald stood as the Conservative candidate in Southwark and Bermondsey, coming third with 12.6% of the vote behind the incumbent Liberal MP Simon Hughes and the Labour candidate.

He became the Vice-President of the Southwark and Bermondsey Conservative Association in 1988 for five years, becoming the President for five years from 1993.

==Parliamentary career==

Heald was elected to the House of Commons as MP for North Hertfordshire at the 1992 general election with 49.8% of the vote and a majority of 16,531. He made his maiden speech on 9 June 1992 in which he spoke of his political beginnings on a soapbox at Speakers&#x27; Corner.

In Parliament he served on the Education Select committee for two years from 1992. He was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Home Office Peter Lloyd in 1994. Later in the year he became the PPS to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, William Waldegrave.

He was promoted to serve in the Government of John Major in 1995 when he was appointed as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security, where he remained until the fall of the Conservative government in 1997. In 1995 he introduced the &quot;Insurance Companies (Reserves) Act&quot;.

Prior to the 1997 general election, Heald&#x27;s constituency of North Hertfordshire was abolished, and replaced with North East Hertfordshire. At the election, Heald was elected to Parliament as MP for North East Hertfordshire with 41.7% of the vote and a majority of 3,088.

After the election he became an Opposition Whip under the new leadership of William Hague, before moving on to become a Spokesman for Home Affairs with responsibility for police matters.

At the 2015 general election, Heald was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 55.4% and an increased majority of 19,080.

Heald was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.

On 29 September 2016, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and may therefore use the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

Heald was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with an increased vote share of 58.6% and a decreased majority of 16,835.

In December 2017 Heald voted with fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve and nine other Conservative MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a &quot;meaningful vote&quot; on any deal Theresa May agrees with Brussels over Brexit.

At the 2019 general election, Heald was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 56.6% and an increased majority of 18,189.

<text>John Healey (born 13 February 1960) is a British politician who has served as Secretary of State for Defence since July 2024. A member of the Labour Party, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rawmarsh and Conisbrough, previously Wentworth and Wentworth and Dearne, since 1997.

Healey served under Tony Blair as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Adult Skills from 2001 to 2002, as Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 2005 to 2007, and under Gordon Brown as Minister of State for Local Government from 2007 to 2009 and as Minister of State for Housing and Planning from 2009 to 2010.

Following the 2010 general election, he was elected to the Shadow Cabinet and was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Health by Ed Miliband. He stood down from the role in October 2011 and was succeeded by Andy Burnham. He also served as Shadow Secretary of State for Housing from 2016 to 2020 under Jeremy Corbyn, and worked alongside Andrew Gwynne, the Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.

==Early life and career==
John Healey was born on 13 February 1960 in Wakefield, the son of Aidan Healey OBE. He was educated at the Lady Lumley&#x27;s School in Pickering before attending the independent St Peter&#x27;s School, York for sixth form. He studied Social and Political Science at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he received a BA in 1982.

Healey worked as a journalist and the deputy editor of &quot;The House&quot;, the internal magazine of the Palace of Westminster, for a year in 1983. In 1984 he became a full-time disability rights campaigner for several national charities.

Healey joined Issues Communications in 1990 as a campaign manager before becoming the head of communications at the Manufacturing, Science and Finance trade union in 1992. He was appointed as the campaign director with the Trades Union Congress in 1994, in which capacity he remained until his election to the House of Commons. He was also a tutor at the Open University Business School.

== Parliamentary career ==
Healey&#x27;s first attempt to enter Parliament was as candidate for Ryedale at the 1992 general election, where he finished in third with 13.8% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP John Greenway and the Liberal Democrat Elizabeth Shields.

=== In government (1997–2010) ===
At the 1997 general election, Healey was the Labour Party candidate for Wentworth, which had become available following the retirement of the Labour MP Peter Hardy. Healey was elected to Parliament with 72.3% of the vote and a majority of 23,959.

Healey served as a member of the education and employment select committee from 1997 until he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown in 1999.

At the 2001 general election, Healey was re-elected as MP for Wentworth with a decreased vote share of 67.5% and a decreased majority of 16,449. Following the election, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Adult Skills at the Department for Education and Skills.

At the 2005 general election Healey was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 59.6% and a decreased majority of 15,056.

On 29 June 2007, Healey was moved to the Department for Communities and Local Government as a result of a government reshuffle. Shortly after his appointment he assumed responsibility for assisting the recovery from widespread flooding across the United Kingdom.

In a Cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009, he was appointed Minister of State for Housing and Planning, replacing Margaret Beckett who had resigned. While Minister of State for Housing and Planning, he was criticised for suggesting that more people renting properties rather than buying their own homes was a good thing.

===In opposition (2010–2024)===
At the 2010 general election Healey was elected to Parliament as the MP for the newly created constituency of Wentworth and Dearne with 50.6% of the vote and a majority of 13,920.

Healey came second in the election for the shadow cabinet in 2010, and was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Health. He resigned from this position in 2011 in order to spend more time with his family.

At the 2015 general election Healey was re-elected as MP for Wentworth and Dearne with an increased vote share of 56.3% and a decreased majority of 13,838.

In 2015 three Rotherham Labour MPs, Kevin Barron, Sarah Champion and Healey, started a defamation legal action against UKIP MEP Jane Collins after Collins falsely alleged in a UKIP conference speech that the three MPs knew about child exploitation in Rotherham but did not intervene. In February 2017 the MPs were awarded £54,000 each in damages.

Following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Party leader, Healey was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election. Following the leadership election, Healey was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Housing in October 2016.

At the snap 2017 general election Healey was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 65% and an increased majority of 14,803. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 40.3% and a decreased majority of 2,165.

==== Shadow cabinet ====
Following the election of Keir Starmer as leader of the Labour party, Healey was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Defence in 2020.

As Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, Healey has repeatedly stressed his support for Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian war since Russia&#x27;s invasion in 2022, endorsed the UK&#x27;s support for Ukraine, and committed to continue Britain&#x27;s support for Ukraine in any future Labour government. In May 2024, Healey visited Kyiv along with Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs David Lammy and met the head of the President&#x27;s Office Andriy Yermak and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov. In a joint statement, Healey and Lammy stated: &quot;The next Labour government&#x27;s commitment to Ukraine will be ironclad, and European security will be our first foreign and defence priority.&quot;

Healey has argued in favour of higher spending on the British military with a larger armed force, closer co-operation and leadership with NATO and European nations over security and defence matters, and for a &quot;comprehensive UK-Germany defence and security pact&quot;. Healey has said that NATO will need to do more &quot;heavy-lifting&#x27; in Europe, as the winner of the 2024 US Presidential Election is likely to prioritise the threat of China.

In April 2024, Healey committed to raising Britain&#x27;s defence spending to 2.5% of Britain&#x27;s GDP by 2030 and commissioning a strategic review of the threats to Britain and its capabilities. In June 2024, he and Starmer announced Labour&#x27;s nuclear deterrent &quot;triple lock&quot;, pledging to build four Dreadnought-class submarines to replace Britain&#x27;s existing Vanguard-class submarines, maintain a continuous at-sea deterrent, and deliver needed upgrades now and in future.

Healey voted in favour of British participation in the 2003 Iraq War. In 2024, he said that the decision to go to war &quot;wasn&#x27;t sound at the time&quot; and said the lesson was that military intervention could not have a successful outcome without sufficient diplomatic, economic, and security follow-through.

=== Secretary of State for Defence (2024–present)===

Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Healey&#x27;s constituency of Wentworth and Dearne was abolished, and replaced with Rawmarsh and Conisbrough. At the 2024 general election, Healey was elected to Parliament as MP for Rawmarsh and Conisborough with 49% of the vote and a majority of 6,908. After Labour&#x27;s victory at the general election, Healey was appointed Secretary of State for Defence by Starmer on 5 July. Healey visited Ukraine shortly after being appointed Defence Secretary, meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky in Odessa.

Healey alongside Starmer, attended the 2024 NATO Summit on 9 July, where he told reporters in that Britain will be the &quot;leading European nation&quot; in defence spending and declared that Britain will be &quot;democracy&#x27;s most reliable ally&quot;. Healey said that he acknowledged that the European members of the alliance, have to take on more responsibility in guarding both Ukraine and the west against Russia and also the need to cooperate with the US regardless of who is inside the White House.

Healey supported the government&#x27;s &quot;root and branch&quot; defence review and hailed it as the &quot;first of its kind&quot; which would consider the state of the armed forces, threats to national security and the defence capabilities needed to address with ultimate the goal of spending 2.5% of national income on defence. Upon taking office, Healey said that problems in the British military were &quot;worse than we thought&quot; after a defence review was conducted by the new government. He noted that &quot;these are serious times&quot; with &quot;rapidly increasing global threats&quot; and said that he wanted to avoid &quot;age-old tactics&quot; by the armed forces over funds to back pet projects. Following a financial audit conducted by the government following the election, Healey warned of possible cuts on defence spending as &quot;tough choices&quot; lie ahead to tackle the £22 billion &quot;black hole&quot; in public finances.

On 3 September, the government announced that it had suspended 30 out of 350 export licences to Israel which faced criticism from both politicians and the Jewish community. The criticism was due to the timing of the suspension, as it took place on the same day as the funerals of six murdered hostages were held. Healey responded by saying that it was the government&#x27;s &quot;legal responsibility&quot; to review export licences and to judge &quot;whether there is a clear risk that anything we supply from this country could be linked to a serious violation of international humanitarian law&quot;. Healey stated that &quot;without fear or favour&quot; the government will subscribe to international law in reference to ICC prosecutor Karim Khan applying arrest warrants against three senior Hamas officials alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Healey also further stated that failure to recognise the ICC ruling will threaten global &quot;rules-based order&quot;.

Healey warned on 13 February 2025 that there can be no negotiation &quot;about Ukraine without Ukraine&quot; after United States President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed to begin talks to end the war.

==Personal life==
Healey married Jackie Bate on 25 October 1993 in Lambeth and they have one son.

<doc id="434630" wikidata="Q5300550" url="?curid=434630" title="Doug Henderson (Labour politician)">
<text>Douglas John Henderson (born 9 June 1949) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne North from 1987 to 2010. In 2015, he was appointed chairman of Falkirk F.C., a position he held until June 2017.

==Early life==
Doug Henderson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and educated at the Waid Academy, Anstruther, before going on later to study economics at both the Central College of Commerce, Glasgow, and the University of Strathclyde. He was an apprentice engineer with Rolls-Royce in Glasgow for two years from 1966, before joining British Rail as a clerk for a year in 1968. After university he joined the National Union of General and Municipal Workers trade union as a research officer in 1973 and remained employed by the union (and its successor the GMB Union) until he was elected to parliament 24 years later. In 1975, he was appointed as the GMB&#x27;s Scottish organiser, moving to become the organiser in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1985.

==Parliamentary career==
He was the chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in 1984 and was elected to the House of Commons at the 1987 General Election for Newcastle North in Tyneside following the deselection of the sitting Labour MP Robert Brown. Henderson held the seat with a majority of 5,243, and in the 2005 election, he received 50% of the vote with a majority of 7,023; this was down from a majority of 14,450 and 60.2% share in 2001.

He was promoted to the frontbench by Neil Kinnock in 1988 as a spokesman on trade and industry, until he moved under the new leadership of John Smith to serve as a spokesman on the environment in 1992. Following Smith&#x27;s death in 1994 he was moved by Tony Blair to become the Deputy shadow Leader of the House of Commons and spokesman on John Major&#x27;s citizens&#x27; charter. In 1995, he became a home affairs spokesman. When the first Blair government was elected at the 1997 General Election he was made a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the brief of Minister for Europe, before moving to the Ministry of Defence in 1998 as the Minister for the armed forces. He was sacked in 1999 amid speculation that his close association with and perceived loyalty to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown eventually cost him his government job, and he became an increasingly outspoken backbencher. In May 2006, Henderson joined other Labour MPs in urging Prime Minister Tony Blair to set a date to step down following the dismissal of Charles Clarke as Home Secretary. He stated that &quot;Quite frankly, Tony Blair has done his bit and it is now time for him to tell us when he is going to go.&quot; He is the vice chairman of the all party groups on the Philippines; Malaysia; and the chocolate and confectionery industry. He spoke in favour of government plans to replace Trident in the debate on 14 March 2007.

Henderson is also employed as a member of fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s advisory board, work that &quot;normally takes about 10 days a year and a bit of preparation.&quot; for which he receives a salary of £25,000 per year. This information was revealed after MPs were required to supply details of non-Parliamentary earnings.

During the coverage of leaked Parliamentary expenses details in 2009, it was revealed that Henderson claimed £800 for telephone calls from a house in Anstruther, Scotland, in 2007/08. Henderson confirmed that he lives and works at his home in Fife, more than 150 miles from his constituency in Newcastle. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; newspaper rated him as &quot;one of the worst for value-for-money,&quot; in their assessment of MPs &quot;based on how much work they did in parliament compared to their overall expenses.&quot; The MP was present at half of House of Commons votes in 2007/08 and claimed £151,860 in expenses.

On 4 July 2009, Henderson announced his intention to stand down at the next general election.

Member of Council of Europe and Western European Union which became ESDA. Chair of the WEU/ESDA Defence Committee 2008–2010. Vice Chair of the Migration Committee of the Council of Europe.

==Personal life==

Doug Henderson is a season ticket holder of Falkirk F.C. and was appointed club chairman in 2015, where he held that position until stepping down in June 2017. He married Janet Margaret Graham in 1974 and they had a son, Keir, before they divorced. 

He married Geraldine Daly in 2002 with whom he had a daughter, Ella. They subsequently divorced. 

He married Jane Bowles in July 2022.

<text>Ivan John Henderson (born 7 June 1958) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Harwich from 1997 to 2005. He is currently a member of Essex County Council for Harwich.

==Early life==
Henderson attended the Sir Anthony Deane Comprehensive, now known as the Harwich and Dovercourt High School.

Henderson was previously a Harwich Town Councillor and Tendring District Councillor. He was a stevedore for Harwich International Port. He became a trade union official.

==Parliamentary career==
When elected in 1997, Henderson was Harwich&#x27;s first Labour MP. He had expected to finish third in votes, and had to tell his dock manager that he could not work a scheduled shift.

In Parliament Henderson was a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Home Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Treasury. He worked closely with Gordon Brown, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer, until he lost his seat to the Conservative Douglas Carswell in the 2005 general election. In the 2010 general election Henderson contested the Clacton constituency, aside from the town of Harwich itself, which contained much of the former constituency of Harwich, however he was unsuccessful.

Ivan Henderson continues to play an active role in local politics, acting as the Labour Party&#x27;s spokesman for Harwich and Clacton. Recent work includes the Kirby Cross Sports Pavilion, where funding that was obtained by Tendring District Council came about through Henderson&#x27;s discussions with the Football Association. When it came to be opened, Ivan managed to secure a visit from Richard Caborn MP. He also successfully campaigned for Trinity House HQ to remain in Harwich, he was later reelected to his former East Ward on the Town and District council.

==Post-parliamentary career==
Boundary changes saw the old Harwich constituency reconstituted into the new Harwich and North Essex and Clacton constituencies. Henderson was selected to contest the Clacton seat for the 2010 general election. In the election Henderson polled 25% of the vote, putting him more than 12,000 votes behind Carswell.

After this unsuccessful parliamentary comeback, Henderson was elected to Tendring District Council in 2011, winning Harwich East ward in his hometown.

In 2013 he was elected as an Essex County Councillor for Harwich, unseating the incumbent Conservative Ricky Callender. He was later reelected in 2017. He has since become the leader of the Labour Group on both councils.

In 2021 Henderson became Mayor of Harwich, and said he was extremely &quot;proud&quot; to have done so, saying that now he has been a representative at all levels, he feels that &quot;he has completed the set&quot;.

==Personal life==
From his first marriage, he has one son and a daughter; from his second marriage he has one son. He married Jo&#x27;Anne Atkinson on 13 June 1992. His children are Joseph Henderson, Stuart Henderson and Melissa Henderson.

His wife is also a member of Tendring District Council.

<doc id="434635" wikidata="Q673765" url="?curid=434635" title="Charles Hendry">
<text>Charles Hendry, (born 6 May 1959) is a British Conservative Party politician. Formerly the member of parliament for High Peak between the 1992 and 1997 general elections, he was returned as the MP for Wealden in 2001. In May 2010 he was appointed Minister of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change and served until 2012. He stood down at the 2015 general election.

==Early life==
The son of a stockbroker, Hendry was educated at Rugby School, Warwickshire and the University of Edinburgh where he was awarded a Bachelor of Commerce (BComm) degree in Business Studies in 1981. He was the president of the Edinburgh University Conservative Association in 1979. He worked as an account manager with Ogilvy and Mather PR for six years from 1982, and from 1988 he worked for two years as a special adviser for the successive Secretaries of State for Social Security John Moore and Tony Newton. He became a senior consultant with Burson-Marsteller in 1990, where he remained until his election to parliament. During his interregnum from parliament he served as the chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition William Hague.

==Political career==
===Early political activities===
Hendry was the vice-chairman of the Scottish Federation of Conservative Students in 1980 and was elected as the vice-chairman of the Battersea Conservative Association for two years in 1981.

He unsuccessfully contested the Central Scotland seat of Clackmannan at the 1983 general election where he came third, finishing 9,988 votes behind the sitting Labour MP Martin O&#x27;Neill. He contested the Nottinghamshire seat of Mansfield at the 1987 general election where he was narrowly defeated by Alan Meale, who won by just 56 votes: this was the joint closest constituency vote in the whole election.

===In parliament===

Hendry was elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election for the Derbyshire seat of High Peak following the retirement of the Conservative MP Christopher Hawkins. Hendry held the seat with a majority of 4,819.

In Parliament he was a member of the procedure select committee for three years from 1992 and he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Department of Social Security William Hague in 1994 for a year, and also served briefly as the PPS to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment Gillian Shephard in 1995. He also served on the Northern Ireland select committee 1994–1996. He was appointed as the vice chairman of the Conservative Party in 1995 by John Major, in which capacity he remained until he lost his seat, representing part of the Peak District, at the 1997 general election when he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Tom Levitt by 8,791 votes. He was re-elected to parliament at the 2001 general election for the East Sussex seat of Wealden following the retirement of the Conservative MP Geoffrey Johnson Smith. Hendry retained his new seat for his party with a majority of 13,772.

On his re-election in 2001, he was appointed an Opposition Whip by Hague, and was appointed as a spokesman on Education and Skills in 2003 under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. In June 2003, he called for the introduction of &quot;first time voter packs&quot; to help to engage young people in the political process. However, he was moved in July 2003 under Michael Howard to again become a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party before serving as a spokesman on trade and industry from early 2005. He served briefly as a member of the culture, media and sport select committee in 2004. He also served as the vice-chairman of the all-party groups on endometriosis, Internet and management.

In September 2006, Hendry became a Patron of the Tory Reform Group. Hendry was a Shadow Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change from October 2008. He became Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change in May 2010 before being replaced by John Hayes in September 2012. Five months later he was announced as the new Chairman of Forewind, the offshore wind farms joint venture, replacing Lord Deben who had resigned the chairmanship in September 2012 when he became Chair of the Committee on Climate Change.

In January 2008 he was appointed as a Vice-Chair of the Board of Trustees of UK Youth Parliament. He had served as Co-Chair from late 2006 but governance changes dissolved the Co-Chair system in favour of a sole Chair.

In May 2010 he took his share of the vote to the 30th largest of the Conservatives&#x27; 307 seats, on an absolute majority of votes at 56.6%. Since November 2012, he has been the Prime Ministerial Trade Envoy to Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.

In March 2013, Hendry announced he would stand down as MP at the 2015 general election.

In July 2013, it became known that Hendry had secured a job as adviser to the Atlantic Supergrid Corporation which plans to import power to the UK via an undersea cable from Iceland. Hendry had signed an energy pact with Iceland while he was Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change.

In March 2015, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and therefore granted the title The Right Honourable.

Hendry was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to UK trade and investment.

==Personal life==
Hendry married Sallie Moores, who had first married into the Moores family of the Littlewoods company, in July 1995 in Westminster and has two sons and two stepchildren. In 2011 they sold their London home for £4.75 million and bought Blair Castle in Ayrshire.

Hendry was a director of London Oil &amp; Gas, which borrowed £129 million from London Capital &amp; Finance. Following the collapse of LC&amp;F, administrators named Hendry as one of thirteen people they were intending to sue in order to recoup £178 million of investors funds.

<text>Stephen Hepburn (born 6 December 1959) is a British politician, who was the Member of Parliament for Jarrow from 1997 to 2019. Hepburn was a member of the Labour Party until 7 October 2019, when he was suspended from the party following an accusation of sexual harassment. He then sat as an independent and was barred by the party from standing as a Labour candidate.

==Early life==
Stephen Hepburn was born on 6 December 1959 to Peter and Margaret Hepburn in Jarrow, South Tyneside. He was educated at Springfield School, Jarrow (now Jarrow School) and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne where he studied politics. He worked as a personal assistant to Donald Dixon (MP for Jarrow).

==Early career==
He was elected as a councillor to South Tyneside Borough Council in 1985, becoming the deputy leader for seven years in 1990, and he remained a councillor whilst serving as an MP. Hepburn served as the chairman of Tyne and Wear Pensions for eight years from 1989. In the 1990s, he was fined £75 for an assault on fellow councillor Iain Malcolm.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected to the British House of Commons for Jarrow following Dixon&#x27;s retirement at the 1997 general election. Hepburn won the seat with a majority of 21,933. He made his maiden speech on 21 May 1997, in which he mentioned Ellen Wilkinson and the 1936 Jarrow March.

He served on both the administration and the defence select committees for four years from 1997. He was on the Accommodation and Works Committee from 2003 until the 2005 general election, following which he served on the Northern Ireland select committee. He also served as the chairman of the all party group on shipbuilding and ship repair, and was secretary of the all party group on football.

On 7 October 2019, Hepburn was suspended from the Labour Party pending an investigation into alleged sexual harassment of a female party member in 2005. He denied the allegation.

<text>John Heppell (born 3 November 1948) is a former British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham East from 1992 until he stepped down at the 2010 general election. He was Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 2005 to 2007.

On 26 March 2010, Heppell announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election due to his wife suffering from breast cancer.

<text>Stephen Hesford (born 27 May 1957) is a British Labour politician and barrister who served as the member of parliament (MP) for Wirral West from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
Born in Lowton St Mary&#x27;s, near Leigh, Lancashire, Hesford was educated at Urmston Grammar School. In 1978, he received a BSc in Social Science from the University of Bradford, and earned an LLM at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1980.

Hesford was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1981 and worked as a criminal law barrister in Altrincham, Cheshire until his election to Parliament.

==Parliamentary career==
Hesford was an assistant to Joan Lestor, Labour MP for Eccles, in 1992, and unsuccessfully contested South Suffolk in the general election of the same year.

He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for Wirral West, defeating former Cabinet minister David Hunt with a 13.8% swing. Making his maiden speech on 3 July 1997, Hesford recalled a constituency predecessor and former House Speaker Selwyn Lloyd.

Hesford served on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee from 1998 to 2000, and the Health and Social Care Committee from 1999 to 2001 and again from 2007 to 2010. He was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Valerie Amos, Leader of the House of Lords, after the 2005 General Election until September 2006. Serving as PPS to Vera Baird, Solicitor General, he resigned in September 2009 in protest over Baroness Scotland remaining as Attorney General after breaking employment laws.

On 23 January 2010, Hesford announced that he would not stand at the 2010 general election for &quot;family reasons&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hesford married Elizabeth Anne Henshall in 1984, with whom he has two sons. He is a member of the Fabian Society and the Lancashire County Cricket Club.

Since leaving Parliament, he has become a guest lecturer at the University of Chester.

<doc id="434644" wikidata="Q6384494" url="?curid=434644" title="Keith Hill (politician)">
<text>Trevor Keith Hill (born 28 July 1943) is an English Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament for Streatham from 1992 until 2010, as well as in a variety of Government roles as a Whip and a junior minister.

==Early life and career==
Hill was born in Leicester and educated at City Boys&#x27; Grammar School, from where he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He completed a Diploma in Education at University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.

He was then a politics lecturer, firstly in the University of Leicester and at the University of Strathclyde from 1969 to 1973. He worked as a research officer for the Labour Party&#x27;s International Department from 1974 to 1976 before becoming a political officer for the National Union of Railwaymen, subsequently amalgamated into the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT). In the 1979 general election he stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in Blaby.

==Political career==
In the 1992 election, Hill outperformed Labour&#x27;s national performance by being the first Labour MP elected for the Streatham constituency. He defeated the incumbent Conservative MP Sir William Shelton by a convincing margin. This partly reflected changing demographics in the constituency, which includes a large swathe of Brixton.

Following his election as an MP, he served on the Select Committee for Transport from 1992 to 1997. His first Government appointment was as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Hilary Armstrong in 1997. He became an Assistant Government Whip from 1998 to 1999.

Hill&#x27;s ministerial career started when he was appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary for Transport (as well as Minister for London) at the then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in 1999. During his time at DETR, he was responsible for local transport and transport in London.

As Minister for London, Hill was closely involved in preparing the way for London mayoral elections. This was a task that he took to with clear relish – regional television viewers saw Hill doing a rap in the middle of Trafalgar Square with a baseball hat on back to front to try to encourage young Londoners to vote in the elections.

In the ministerial appointments following the 2001 election, Hill moved to the position of Deputy Chief Whip. In a 13 June 2003 reshuffle, he was promoted to Minister of State rank and joined the Privy Council. He served as Minister for Housing and Planning at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister until the 2005 General Election. During this period he had lead responsibility for housing, planning, the Thames Gateway, urban policy and liveability issues, and was Minister for London and the Dome. In the reshuffle following the 2005 general election, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He returned to the backbenches on Gordon Brown&#x27;s becoming Prime Minister in June 2007.

Hill stood down at the 2010 general election. He was offered a knighthood in the 2010 Dissolution Honours, but declined the honour, saying he would find the &quot;whole idea a little embarrassing and too much for me&quot;.

After leaving parliament, Hill become the chair of Lambeth Living, an ALMO (arm&#x27;s length management organisation) which administers most of Lambeth Council&#x27;s social housing stock.

In 2012 Hill was appointed as the independent regulator for the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA) new self-regulatory regime. ARMA is a trade association for firms that manage private residential leasehold blocks of flats in England &amp; Wales and Hill&#x27;s appointment marked the first time that managing agents had been subject to independent regulation.

Hill was confirmed by Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council in February 2015 as chair of the Residents&#x27; Commission on Council Housing.

==Personal life==
Now married, Hill once shared a flat with actor/comedian Eddie Izzard.

==Other==
Hill was described by Routledge&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Almanac of British Politics&quot; as &quot;One of the government&#x27;s insufficiently sung heroes&quot;.

<doc id="434645" wikidata="Q2155091" url="?curid=434645" title="New Year's resolution">
<text>A New Year&#x27;s resolution is a tradition, most common in the Western World but also found in the Eastern World, in which a person resolves to continue good practices, change an undesired trait or behavior, accomplish a personal goal, or otherwise improve their behaviour at the beginning of a calendar year.

==Religious origins==
Around 2000 B.C., the Babylonians celebrated the New Year during a 12-day festival called Akitu (starting with the vernal equinox). This was the start of the farming season to plant crops, crown their king, and make promises to return borrowed farm equipment and pay their debts.

The Babylonian New Year was adopted by the ancient Romans, as was the tradition of resolutions. The timing, however, eventually shifted with the Julian calendar in 46 B.C., which declared January 1st as the start of the new year and began each year by making promises to the god Janus, for whom the month of January is named.

In the medieval era, the knights took the &quot;peacock vow&quot; at the end of the Christmas season each year to re-affirm their commitment to chivalry.

At watchnight services, many Christians prepare for the year ahead by praying and making these resolutions. In Methodist Christianity, the liturgy used for the watchnight service for the New Year is the Covenant Renewal Service; in addition to being traditionally held on New Year&#x27;s Eve, many churches offer the Covenant Renewal Service on both New Year&#x27;s Eve and on the morning of New Year&#x27;s Day.

This tradition has many other religious parallels. During Judaism&#x27;s New Year, Rosh Hashanah, through the High Holy Days and culminating in Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), one is to reflect upon one&#x27;s wrongdoings over the year and both seek and offer forgiveness. People can act similarly during the Christian liturgical season of Lent, although the motive behind this holiday is more of sacrifice than of responsibility. The concept, regardless of creed, is to reflect upon self-improvement annually.

== Participation ==
The 1671 diary of Anne Halkett includes an entry on January 2 titled &quot;Resolutions&quot;, which contained a number of religious pledges taken primarily from bible verses, such as “I will not offend any more.”

By the beginning of the 19th century, the tendency of people to make (and fail to keep) resolutions was commonly known and satirized. &quot;Walker’s Hibernian Magazine&quot; in 1802 contained an article stating that “the following personages have begun the year with a strong of resolutions, which they all solemnly pledged to keep”, then listing a series of obviously fictitious resolutions (“Statesmen have resolved to have no other object in view than the good of their country…the physicians have determined to follow nature in her operations, and to prescribe no more than is necessary, and to be very moderate in their fees.”)

An early instance of the complete phrase &quot;new year resolution&quot; is found in a January 1st issue of a Boston newspaper from 1813:And yet, I believe there are multitudes of people, accustomed to receive injunctions of new year resolutions, who will sin all the month of December, with a serious determination of beginning the new year with new resolutions and new behaviour, and with the full belief that they shall thus expiate and wipe away all their former faults.At the end of the Great Depression, about a quarter of American adults formed New Year&#x27;s resolutions. At the start of the 21st century, about 40% did. In fact, according to the American Medical Association, approximately 40% to 50% of Americans participated in the New Year&#x27;s resolution tradition from the 1995 Epcot and 1985 Gallup Polls. A study found 46% of participants who made common New Year&#x27;s resolutions (e.g. weight loss, exercise programs, quitting smoking) were likely to succeed, over ten times as among those deciding to make life changes at other times of the year.

== Success rate ==
Evidence for actual behaviorial changes after New Year&#x27;s resolutions is mixed. The effect is most pronounced immediately after the new year, but decreases soon afterwards. Approach-oriented goals, rather than avoidance-oriented goals, can lead to better results.

In a 2014 report, 35% of participants who failed their New Year&#x27;s resolutions admitted they had unrealistic goals, 33% of participants did not keep track of their progress, and 23% forgot about them; the remaining respondents claimed they made too many resolutions.

A 1972 study of 382 students at the University of Wisconsin showed minimal impact of New Year&#x27;s resolutions on weight loss commitments, with the study finding that making a resolution or being monitored did not significantly affect weight loss.

A 2007 study by Richard Wiseman from the University of Bristol involving 3,000 people showed that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions fail, despite the fact that 52% of the study&#x27;s participants were confident of success at the beginning. Men achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in goal setting, wherein resolutions are made in terms of small and measurable goals (e.g., &quot;lose a pound a week&quot; rather than &quot;lose weight&quot;).

<text>David Martin Hinchliffe (born 14 October 1948) is a British former Labour politician who was Member of Parliament for Wakefield from 1987 to 2005 when he stood down and was replaced by Mary Creagh.

==Early life==
He went to Lawefield Lane Primary School, then Cathedral School (now Cathedral Academy) on Thornes Road in Wakefield. After Wakefield Technical College, he went to Leeds Polytechnic (now Leeds Beckett University) where he gained a Certificate of Qualification in Social Work in 1971. He gained an MA in Social Work and Community Work from the University of Bradford in 1978. He was a social worker in Leeds from 1968 to 1979. He was a Social Work tutor for Kirklees Council from 1980 to 1987. He played Rugby League from the age of 8, going up through all the ranks to Open-Age rugby. He was playing hooker for Walnut Warriors of Wakefield, against Rossington from Doncaster, when he was concussed and after a couple of days in hospital he retired from playing, aged 29.

==Parliamentary career==
He was Chair of the Health Select Committee.

He was a founder and first secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group in 1988.

Hinchliffe, along with the All-Party Group, campaigned against what he described as &quot;one of the longest (and daftest) grievances in history&quot; that meant anyone over the age of 18 associated with rugby league was banned forever from rugby union, himself included. With the Rugby League Group, he highlighted the lack of official recognition to rugby league in the form of Honours, was instrumental in the lifting of a ban on rugby league in the British armed forces in 1994 and helped the sport to expand beyond its heartlands more freely by exerting pressure on the Rugby Football Union to end its discrimination against even amateur league players.

In 1998 he led the enquiry by the Health Select Committee into &quot;The Welfare of Former British Child Migrants&quot; following the exposure of the scandal by Margaret Humphreys in her book &quot;Empty Cradles&quot;. As a result of the report, in 2010 the UK Government issued an apology to all Child Migrants.

==Personal life==
He married Julia North on 17 July 1982. They have a son, Robert (born October 1985) and a daughter, Rebecca (born May 1988).

<text>Mark Gerard Hoban (born 31 March 1964) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he is a former Member of Parliament for Fareham (2001–2015) and former Minister of State for Work and Pensions (2012–2013).

==Early life==
Hoban was born in Peterlee and was educated at St Leonard&#x27;s Catholic School in Durham. He graduated from the London School of Economics where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1985.

He joined PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1985 as a financial analyst, becoming a chartered account manager in 1990, and was appointed as a senior manager in 1992 until his election to Parliament.

==Parliamentary career==
Hoban joined the Conservative Party in 1980, and in 1989 was elected as the treasurer of the Southampton Itchen Conservative Association, serving until he was elected as the Association&#x27;s vice chairman for two years in 1991.

He was the campaign manager for the local sitting Conservative MP Christopher Chope at both the 1987 and 1992 general elections.

He contested the Tyneside seat of South Shields at the 1997 general election, finishing in second place, 22,153 votes behind the sitting Labour MP, David Clark.

He was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election for the Hampshire seat of Fareham following the retirement of the Conservative MP Peter Lloyd.

Hoban held the seat with a majority of 7,009 and remained the MP there until 2015. He made his maiden speech on 4 July 2001, in which he recalled one of his Fareham predecessors, Arthur Lee, who had donated the Prime Minister&#x27;s country house, Chequers, to the nation in 1921.

In parliament he served as a member of the science and technology select committee for two years from 2001. He was made an Opposition Whip by Iain Duncan Smith in 2002, joining the frontbench under the leadership of Michael Howard in 2003 as a spokesman on education. Following the election of David Cameron as the party&#x27;s leader in 2005, Hoban became Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

After the May 2010 general election, Hoban took his shadow portfolio into Government when he was appointed Financial Secretary and City Minister in George Osborne&#x27;s Treasury team. His responsibilities included financial services policy, including banking and financial services reform and regulation, financial stability, City competitiveness, wholesale and retail markets in the UK, Europe and internationally; the Financial Services Authority (FSA); UK Financial Investments (UKFI); and personal savings and pensions policy. He supported the Chancellor on EU and wider international finance issues.

He was also chairman of the Associate Parliamentary Group on Business, Finance and Accountancy, until succeeded by Ian Wright MP.

It was reported in the &quot;Independent&quot; in December 2011 that Hoban had been involved in meetings with bankers lobbying to avoid proposals in the Vickers Report that were intended to reduce risks in the banking industry. The talks were alleged to be secret, but were obtained via a Freedom of Information request.

In September 2012 Hoban was moved from the Treasury to the Department for Work and Pensions. The Work Capability Assessment for which Hoban had responsibility has been heavily criticised due to its failure rate of more than 30% reversals of decisions upon appeal and because &quot;the descriptors used to qualify for long-term support are so limited that almost nobody does so.&quot; In July 2013, Hoban&#x27;s department asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to &quot;provide independent advice in relation to strengthening quality assurance processes across all its health and disability assessments.&quot;. Hoban received £22,507 in non-cash donations from his former employer PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2009. Hoban left the Government front benches in October 2013.

Hoban voted against gay couples adopting children in 2002, and against the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations in 2003. In 2013, Hoban took part in a discussion about Russia&#x27;s anti-gay legislation with actor Simon Callow and claimed &quot;We have seen a change of people&#x27;s attitudes in the UK and that&#x27;s gathered momentum over time...you can have quite rapid change in these areas.&quot;

During the MPs expenses scandal newspapers reported on Hoban&#x27;s £12,000 furniture bill including £35 on a toilet-roll holder, £10 on a chrome shower rack and £79 on four silk cushions on his second-home allowance. Hoban said, &quot;At the time I made these claims I believed that they were reasonable and within the spirit of the rules.&quot;

Hoban announced that he would be standing down at the 2015 general election, and it was reported that he had already taken up board-level roles at three businesses.

==Personal life==
He has been married to Fiona Jane Barrett since August 1994 and they live in his former constituency, at Locks Heath. He has been an associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales since 1988. Hoban is a Roman Catholic and attends mass regularly at St. Margaret Mary&#x27;s Catholic Parish in Park Gate.
