<doc id="431773" wikidata="Q29957" url="?curid=431773" title="Funnel">
<text>A funnel is a tube or pipe that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, used for guiding liquid or powder into a small opening.

Funnels are usually made of stainless steel, aluminium, glass, or plastic. The material used in its construction should be sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. For this reason, stainless steel or glass are useful in transferring Diesel fuel, while plastic funnels are useful in the kitchen. Sometimes disposable paper funnels are used in cases where it would be difficult to adequately clean the funnel afterwards (for example, in adding motor oil into a car). Dropper funnels, also called dropping funnels or tap funnels, have a tap to allow the controlled release of a liquid. A flat funnel, made of polypropylene, utilises living hinges and flexible walls to fold flat.

The term &quot;funnel&quot; may refer to the chimney or smokestack on a steam locomotive and commonly refers to the same on a ship. The term &quot;funnel&quot; is also applied to other seemingly strange objects like a smoking pipe or a kitchen bin.

==Laboratory funnels==

There are many different kinds of funnels that have been adapted for specialised applications in the laboratory, such as Filter funnels and thistle funnels (shaped like thistle flowers). Dropping funnels have stopcocks which allow the fluids to be added to a flask slowly. For solids, a powder funnel with a wide and short stem is more appropriate as it does not clog easily.

When used with filter paper, filter funnels, Büchner and Hirsch funnels can be used to remove fine particles from a liquid in a process called filtration. For more demanding applications, the filter paper in the latter two may be replaced with a sintered glass frit. Separatory funnels are used in liquid-liquid extractions. The Tullgren funnel is used to collect arthropods from plant litter or similar material.

=== Construction ===
Glass is the material of choice for laboratory applications due to its inertness compared with metals or plastics. However, plastic funnels made of nonreactive polyethylene are used for transferring aqueous solutions. Plastic is most often used for powder funnels that do not come into contact with solvent in normal use.

=== Uses ===
* To channel liquids or fine-grained substances into containers with a small opening. Used for pouring liquids or powder through a small opening and for holding the filter paper in filtration. Used in transferring liquids in small containers.
* Funnels known as killing cones are used to slaughter individual birds in poultry farming. The funnel is used to hold a bird upside down so that it can be bled more easily.

<text>U.S. Route 180 is an east–west United States highway. Like many three-digit routes, US 180 no longer meets its &quot;parent&quot;, US 80. US 80 was decommissioned west of Mesquite, Texas, and was replaced in Texas by Interstate 20 and Interstate 10 resulting in U.S. 180 being 57 miles longer than U.S. 80. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Hudson Oaks, Texas (west of Fort Worth, near Weatherford), at an intersection with Interstate 20. Its western terminus is unclear. Signage at an intersection with State Route 64 in Valle, Arizona 40 miles (64 km) northwest of Flagstaff indicates that the route starts at SR 64, which is consistent with the AASHTO U.S. Highway logs. However, many maps continue the US 180 designation to the south rim of the Grand Canyon at Grand Canyon Village. Signage at the SR 64 intersection as of 2021 indicated that US 180 continues north concurrent with the route. However, no signage along the route exists past this intersection until SR 64 turns east towards Cameron, Arizona. At this intersection, signage makes no mention of US 180 nor is there any mention at the terminus of SR 64 at US 89.

==Route description==

Four National Parks can be accessed on the highway, Grand Canyon National Park, Petrified Forest National Park, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and Carlsbad Caverns National Park. It also passes through the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountains in Arizona.

===Arizona===

In Flagstaff, US 180 is concurrent with Interstate 40 Business and historic U.S. Route 66 for a short distance through the city. US 180 joins the former routing of Route 66 in the center of Flagstaff and follows the roadway to where it merges with Interstate 40 east of the city. From the western terminus of the overlap, the intersection with eastbound Interstate 40 is two miles (3 km) to the east, and the intersection with westbound Interstate 40 and with Interstate 17 is three miles (5 km) to the southwest.
US 180 shares numbering with Interstate 40 from Flagstaff, Arizona, to Holbrook, Arizona. At Holbrook, US 180 follows Interstate 40 Business along South Navajo Boulevard. Shortly after following South Navajo Boulevard, however, US 180 follows a south-southeast route, running by the Petrified Forest National Park and continuing South-Southeast to and through a small branch of the Zuni Indian Reservation, to St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona where it meets U.S. Route 191. After meeting up with US 191, US 180 continues south to the town of Springerville, Arizona, where the routes meet U.S. Route 60 the 3 routes begin a triple concurrency through Springerville. On the east side of Springerville US 60 leaves the concurrency and US 180 and US 191 head south through Eagar, Arizona where the two routes enter the Apache National Forest and finally split at the town of Alpine, Arizona, roughly 6 miles from the Arizona-New Mexico border.

===New Mexico/West Texas (El Paso area)===
After entering New Mexico from just east of Alpine, Arizona, US 180 continues south until Silver City, New Mexico. From Silver City, US 180 travels just east for roughly 7 miles, meeting up with New Mexico State Road 90, New Mexico State Road 15, and New Mexico State Road 152. US 180 now travels southeast for roughly to Deming, New Mexico, where it meets up with Interstate 10. From Deming, US 180 follows Interstate 10 through Las Cruces, New Mexico, and enters Texas at Anthony, New Mexico. The route is concurrent with Interstate 10 through the west and central portions of El Paso, Texas, and separates from I-10 at Paisano Drive, joining U.S. Route 62. US 62/180 is concurrent with Montana Avenue in East Central El Paso (after the intersection with Paisano Drive), and continues to be called Montana Avenue until it reaches RM 2775 (Hueco Tanks Road). US 62/180 then travels east, going past the spur RM 2775 (which goes north to Hueco Tanks) through the southern end of the Guadalupe Mountains National Park (90 miles east of El Paso), and past the southern face of Guadalupe Peak (the highest point in Texas) towards New Mexico and Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Continuing though Carlsbad, New Mexico, US 180 and US 62 travels toward Texas running through Hobbs, New Mexico, and exiting New Mexico just east of Hobbs.
US 180 used to be a two-lane highway until around 2008 but is now a divided highway in the entire state with a speed limit of 70 mph for most of the length.

===Texas===

After re-entering Texas from just east of Hobbs, New Mexico, US 180 splits from US 62 at Seminole, Texas. US 180 continues eastward running through the towns of: 
Lamesa, Gail, Snyder, Roby, Anson, Albany, and Breckenridge. For the last portion of its length, the road runs through the scenic Palo Pinto Mountains, exiting them at Metcalf Gap. Towns in this final portion include Palo Pinto, Mineral Wells and Cool.

US 180 comes into contact with Interstate 20 just east of Weatherford, Texas, and ends in Hudson Oaks, Texas.

In Texas, US 180 intersects U.S. Highway 385, U.S. Highway 87, U.S. Highway 84, U.S. Highway 83, U.S. Highway 277, U.S. Highway 283, U.S. Highway 183, U.S. Highway 281, and Interstate 20.

The speed limit is 75 mph in Hudspeth and Culberson counties except through Guadalupe Pass. beginning just over 1/2 mile east of mile marker 52 to the state line at FM 652.

==History==
U.S. Route 260 (US 260) was a spur of U.S. Route 60, established on May 26, 1930. It connected Springerville, Arizona, and Holbrook, Arizona, replacing the former western end of US 70. US 60. On January 19, 1935, US 260 was extended eastward to US 80 near Deming, New Mexico, establishing a concurrency with US 666 from Springerville to Alpine in Arizona.

U.S. Route 180 (US 180) was originally proposed in 1943 as an extension of US 80 Alternate. At the time, US 80 Alt. ran entirely within Texas, from Abilene to Weatherford. The proposed re-routing and extension would remove US 80 Alt. between Abilene and Albany and extend the designation through New Mexico via Hobbs and Carlsbad, to US 80 in El Paso. The proposed route would be concurrent with US 62 between El Paso and Seminole. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) was willing to approve the request but recommended the route be re-designated with a different number. As a result, the highway was approved and commissioned at the 1943 AASHO Annual Meeting as US 180. On October 7, 1961, the entire route of US 260 became part of a western extension of US 180.

<doc id="431785" wikidata="Q2105545" url="?curid=431785" title="Randy VanWarmer">
<text>Randy VanWarmer (also spelled Vanwarmer or Van Warmer; March 30, 1955 – January 12, 2004) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. His biggest hit song was &quot;Just When I Needed You Most&quot;. It reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1979 after peaking at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks earlier that year.

He wrote several songs for The Oak Ridge Boys, including &quot;I Guess It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes,&quot; which reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The song appeared on his 1981 album &quot;Beat of Love&quot;, which also included the &quot;Suzi Found a Weapon&quot;, which hit No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Career==
Randall VanWarmer was born in Indian Hills, Colorado, the son of Roger VanWarmer (1919–1967) and Betsy (née Harry; 1919–2006). At 15, three years after the death of his father in an automobile accident, he moved with his mother to Cornwall, England. 

In a 1989 interview with &quot;Release&quot;, a now-defunct independent paper from Stanford, California, Van Warmer said that Albert Grossman, the head of Bearsville Records, would not let him do television or tour the United States, a strategy that did not prove successful.

His second album, &quot;Terraform&quot;, was dark and more alternative than his previous work. According to &quot;Release&quot;, &quot;Terraform&quot; sold moderately in Japan and Australia. VanWarmer would later publicly rue his decision to turn away from ballads. He made two more records at Bearsville: &quot;Beat of Love&quot; and &quot;The Things That You Dream&quot;. &quot;Beat of Love&quot; included the single &quot;Suzi Found a Weapon&quot;, a tribute to a Bearsville public relations rep whom VanWarmer would later marry, and which went to No. 1 in Alaska and gained a certain amount of posthumous acclaim (for example, a review by James A. Gardner in AllMusic). Grossman died soon after this.

According to &quot;Release&quot;, in the mid-1980s, Suzi VanWarmer mailed a song called &quot;I Guess It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes&quot; from &quot;Beat of Love&quot; to a friend at MCA Inc., who sent it to Ron Chancey, producer for the Oak Ridge Boys who put it on their next album. Charley Pride recorded a song of VanWarmer&#x27;s, as did Michael Johnson. VanWarmer moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and the recording of his song, &quot;I&#x27;m in a Hurry (And Don&#x27;t Know Why)&quot; by the band Alabama hit No. 1 on the country chart.

His final album was a tribute to Stephen Foster, released posthumously only in Japan. According to the CD&#x27;s liner notes, VanWarmer played all the instruments on the album. The notes also indicate that he completed work on the record a few days after learning he had leukemia; he died at 48, one day before the anniversary of Foster&#x27;s death.

Some of his cremated remains were sent into space in 2007 and then again in 2012 aboard the first successful private space flight to the International Space Station.

==Death==
VanWarmer died on January 12, 2004, at the age of 48 in Seattle. He had been suffering from leukemia for the previous year. He is survived by his widow Suzi and his brothers Dave, Mark, and Ron.

<doc id="431786" wikidata="Q2304229" url="?curid=431786" title="Cream soda">
<text>Cream soda (also known as creme soda or creaming soda) is a sweet soft drink. Generally flavored with vanilla and based on the taste of an ice cream float, a wide range of variations can be found worldwide.

==History and development==
A recipe for cream soda written by E. M. Sheldon and published in &quot;Michigan Farmer&quot; in 1852 called for water, cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), Epsom salts, sugar, egg, and milk to be mixed, then heated, then mixed again once cooled with water and a quarter teaspoonful of baking soda to make an effervescent drink. It was suggested as a temperance drink preferable to those of &quot;Uncle Bacchus&quot; and in compliance with the recently introduced Maine law.
An alternative recipe can be found combining a soda of choice as well as whipped cream.

Alexander C. Howell of Vienna, New Jersey was granted a patent for &quot;cream soda-water&quot; on June 27, 1865. Howell&#x27;s cream soda-water was made with sodium bicarbonate, water, sugar, egg whites, wheat flour, and &quot;any of the usual flavoring materials—such as oil of lemon, extracts of vanilla, pine-apple, to suit the taste&quot;. Before drinking, the cream soda-water was mixed with water and an acid such as tartaric acid or citric acid. In Canada, James William Black of Berwick, Nova Scotia, was granted a U.S. patent on December 8, 1885, and a Canadian patent on July 5, 1886, for &quot;ice-cream soda&quot;. Black&#x27;s ice-cream soda, which contained whipped egg whites, sugar, lime juice, lemons, citric acid, flavoring, and bicarbonate of soda, was a concentrated syrup that could be reconstituted into an effervescent beverage by adding ordinary ice water. In The United States Ugo H. Sodini helped to pioneer in the creation of vanilla cream soda.

==International variations==

===Oceania===

====Australia====

In Australia, two distinctly different coloured sodas exist, red and brown, both usually called creaming soda, although some brands such as Bickford&#x27;s, use the term creamy soda. Almost all varieties are predominantly vanilla based, but red or pink varieties introduce raspberry flavouring. Another local variant produced by Golden Circle is vanilla and fruit-flavoured, and coloured yellow to distinguish it from existing brands. More traditional brown varieties are also available, but less common. Brands include Kirks&#x27; Sno Drop (only available in South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory), Tarax, River Port, Hartz, Saxby&#x27;s, Bert&#x27;s Snowette (the original recipe of Shelley&#x27;s Snowcap (Snowcap Champagne) before the line was acquired) and Schweppes, which also produce a red variety as part of its &quot;Traditionals&quot; range.

Bundaberg Burgundee creaming soda is based on red grapes and is alternately made by other producers under the name portello.

The term &quot;creaming soda&quot; is used to refer to the drink itself, whereas the combination of soda and ice-cream is called a spider.

====New Zealand====
This is known as creaming soda, ice cream soda, chill drink, or cream soda, though the flavour changes are negligible. It is usually a bright yellow colour or a white opaque. It is one of the many flavours sold by Foxton Fizz. It is also one of the many carbonated drink-flavours offered by Golden Circle.

===Europe===

====Netherlands====
A brand called UGGO is sold in the Netherlands, which offers several different flavors of cream soda. The Surinamese soft drink brand Fernandes, widely available in the country, sells cream soda under the name Green Punch; as the name implies, it is green in color. 

Asian (especially Chinese) supermarkets also sell Schweppes Cream Soda, which is imported from Hong Kong. A&amp;W is sold in some supermarkets. 

Old Jamaica Cream Soda (Jamaica) is also sold in the Netherlands.

====Ireland====
Ireland has a brand of clear vanilla-flavoured cream soda called Country Spring.. Country Spring was a soft drink brand made by the Gleeson Group, a company which was in turn purchased by C&amp;C Group in 2012 . Cream Soda made by A.G. Barr is also widely sold and consumed there.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, A.G. Barr (the Scottish company that makes IRN BRU) and Ben Shaw&#x27;s (a Cott brand), manufacture their own brands of cream soda, which are both clear and vanilla-flavoured and some supermarket chains sell it under their respective own brands.

====Finland====
A brand called Sun&#x27;n Cream Soda is made by Finnish brewery Nokian Panimo. They also have a variation called Orange Cream Soda, with a hint of orange taste.

<text>Longwood Gardens is a public garden that consists of more than 1,100 acres (445 hectares; 4.45 km2) of gardens, woodlands, and meadows in the Brandywine Creek Valley in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, United States. It is one of the premier horticultural display gardens in the United States and is open to visitors year-round to enjoy native and exotic plants and horticulture (both indoor and outdoor), events and performances, seasonal and themed attractions, as well as educational lectures, courses, and workshops.

== History ==

Longwood Gardens has a long, varied history. For thousands of years, the native Lenni Lenape tribe fished its streams, hunted its forests, and planted its fields. Evidence of the tribe&#x27;s existence is found in quartz spear points that have been discovered on and around the property and can be found on display in the Peirce-du Pont House on the Longwood Gardens property.

In 1700, a Quaker farmer named George Peirce purchased of this English-claimed land from William Penn&#x27;s commissioners. George&#x27;s son Joshua cleared and farmed the land and in 1730 he built the brick farmhouse that, enlarged, still stands today.
In 1798, Joshua&#x27;s twin grandsons Samuel and Joshua, who had inherited the farm, actively pursued an interest in natural history and began planting an arboretum that eventually covered . The collection included specimens that they collected from the wild as well as plants acquired from some of the region&#x27;s leading botanists.

By 1850, the arboretum boasted one of the finest collections of trees in the nation and had become a place for the locals to gather outdoors—a new concept that was sweeping America at the time. Community picnics and socials were held at Peirce&#x27;s Park in the mid to late 19th century. The Pennsylvania guide noted in 1940 that &quot;Longwood received its present name from &#x27;Long Woods,&#x27; as the section was known before the Civil War, when black slaves fleeing from the South found shelter in this station on the Underground Railroad,which was supported by Quakers of Kennett Square, Hamorton, and Wilmington, Delaware.&quot;

In the early 20th century, the family&#x27;s heirs lost interest in the property and allowed the arboretum to deteriorate. The farm passed out of the family through several hands in quick succession, and a lumber mill operator was about to cut down the trees for timber in early 1906. This threat moved Pierre S. du Pont, American entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist, and member of the du Pont family, to take action. On July 20, 1906, 36-year-old du Pont purchased the farm primarily to preserve the trees, in a transaction managed by Isabel Darlington, Chester County&#x27;s first female lawyer. He was not planning to create Longwood Gardens, but within a few years, his desire to make it a place where he could entertain his friends transformed a simple country farm into one of the country&#x27;s leading horticultural display gardens.

Pierre du Pont opened the garden to the public in 1921 and in 1937 created the Longwood Foundation, which came under the control of trustees in 1946. When he died in 1954, he &quot;had in place a well-funded yet adaptable mechanism for Longwood to continue.&quot; The garden was free, relying solely on its sizable endowment, until 1973, when it began charging admission.

In 2018, Longwood Gardens acquired the historic Longwood Cemetery from its volunteer-run management association. Chartered in 1855, Longwood Cemetery is located just outside of the main Gardens entrance, on Greenwood Road. It lies in front of the historic Longwood Progressive Friends Meeting House, founded by Quaker dissidents in 1854 and acquired by Pierre S. du Pont after it closed in 1940. Bayard Taylor, Eusebius Barnard, and Isaac Mendenhall are among the interments there.

In 2024 Longwood Gardens acquired Granogue, a cultural landscape in Wilmington, Delaware and one of the last remaining unprotected pieces of open space in the Brandywine River corridor.

== Current use ==
Today the Longwood Gardens consists of varied outdoor gardens, ranging from formal to naturalistic in their landscape design. There are of Conservatory gardens under glass, with 13 indoor gardens and 859 different types of permanent plants, as well as fountains. The Gardens also have extensive educational programs including a tuition-free two-year school of professional horticulture, a fellows program, and extensive internships. It hosts hundreds of horticultural and performing arts events each year, from flower shows, gardening demonstrations, courses, and children&#x27;s programs to concerts, organ and carillon recitals, musical theatre, fountain shows, and fireworks displays. It also hosts an extensive Christmas light display during the holiday season.

The Gardens have attracted more than one million visitors a year since 2012. Plans for growth and expansion for the next four decades began in 2010 with the hiring of West 8, a Dutch landscape architecture and urban planning firm with headquarters in Rotterdam and an office in New York City. The founder of West 8, Adriaan Geuze, stated their mission is: &quot;to celebrate Longwood, enjoy it, keep it, preserve it, while asking how it could function as a spectacular place for larger groups of people in the 21st century.&quot; The comprehensive Longwood plan is now complete and the first major project in the plan, the revitalization of the Main Fountain Garden, began in 2014 and completed in 2017.

== Grounds and fountains ==

The development of Longwood as a public garden began in the 1800s with the Peirce family&#x27;s arboretum. Joshua and Samuel Peirce collected many native and exotic trees, which they planted in straight rows on land east of their farmhouse. Peirce also added a historical marker for Hannah Freeman, purportedly the last surviving member of the Lenape people, who had been born in the area in 1731. This area became known as Peirce&#x27;s Park toward the end of the 19th century. Visitors to Longwood Gardens today still enjoy Peirce&#x27;s Park, which is now punctuated by the Sylvan Fountain, added by Pierre S. du Pont in 1925–27.

After Pierre S. du Pont purchased the property in 1906, he began developing the outdoor gardens further, adding the 600-foot long Flower Garden Walk in 1907. The Flower Garden Walk features a pool known as the Round Fountain at the intersection of the main paths. Its simple jet of water was Longwood&#x27;s first fountain.

In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont added the Open Air Theatre after visits to the Villa Gori in Siena, Italy, provided inspiration.

From 1925 to 1927, du Pont designed and constructed the Italian Water Garden on a site northeast of Longwood&#x27;s Large Lake, after gaining inspiration from a visit to the Villa Gamberaia, near Florence, Italy.
In 1928, du Pont began adding fountains to a garden he had begun developing in 1921. This space, directly south of the Conservatory, would become du Pont&#x27;s most ambitious project—the Main Fountain Garden. The Main Fountain Garden &quot;combines Italianate ornamentation and French grandeur with World&#x27;s Fair showmanship. Like other great fountains, it is an engineering tour de force using the latest technology of the time.&quot; The Main Fountain Garden debuted to the public in 1931 and was the last major project in the gardens during du Pont&#x27;s life.

In 1957, the Waterlily Display opened under the direction of Russell Seibert, who was Longwood&#x27;s first director after Pierre du Pont&#x27;s death in 1954.

In the 1970s, landscape architect Thomas Church was engaged to advise Longwood on long-range planning, garden improvement, and visitor circulation. He contributed to many spaces throughout the Gardens, and designed the Theatre Garden (opened in 1975), the Wisteria Garden (opened in 1976), and the Peony Garden (opened in 1976).

By 1977, Thomas Church could no longer visit because of his declining health, and the English designer Sir Peter Shepheard became Longwood&#x27;s consulting architect. In 1987 he re-worked the original Waterlily Display layout. The re-designed garden opened in 1988.

In 1995, landscape architect W. Gary Smith designed Peirce&#x27;s Woods as an &quot;art form&quot; garden that brings together the most ornamental characteristics of the eastern deciduous forest. Thousands of native plants were added, including 10,000 rescued from the North Carolina mountains prior to impending highway construction.

In 2014, Longwood Gardens unveiled its new Meadow Garden, an American landscape spanning that showcases native plantings. The Meadow Garden is actively propagated with herbaceous perennials and includes other interventions to manage invasive plants, control trees and shrubs, and promote wildlife. The Meadow Garden was designed by Jonathan Alderson of Jonathan Alderson Landscape Architects of Wayne, Pennsylvania. The historic Webb Farmhouse, which has stood on the property since the early 1700s, has been restored and serves as an interpretive center. John Milner Architects of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, led the restoration of the farmhouse.

In 2014, under the direction of Paul B. Redman, the gardens embarked on the largest project in its history at the time, the revitalization of its historic Main Fountain Garden. Led by architects Beyer Blinder Belle and Landscape Architects West 8, the Main Fountain Garden re-opened on May 27, 2017.

In 2021, Longwood embarked on &quot;Longwood Reimagined: A New Garden Experience,&quot; the most ambitious expansion, reimagination, and preservation of Longwood&#x27;s Conservatory and surrounding landscape in a century. With the November 2024 opening of &quot;Longwood Reimagined&quot;, new features include the 32,000-square-foot West Conservatory, featuring interior Mediterranean-inspired gardens set amid pools, canals, and fountains; the preservation and relocation of the Cascade Garden—the only design in North America by Roberto Burle Marx—in its own 3,800-square-foot custom glasshouse; a new outdoor Bonsai Courtyard; refreshed Waterlily Court; new 1906 restaurant and The Fountain Room event space overlooking the Main Fountain Garden; new central hub with studios, a library, and staff offices called The Grove; and a preserved and expanded Orchid House.

Outdoor gardens and garden features include: Birdhouse Treehouse, Canopy Cathedral Treehouse, Chimes Tower and Waterfall, Cow Lot, East Conservatory Plaza, Flower Garden Drive, Flower Garden Walk, Forest Walk, Hillside Garden, Idea Garden, Italian Water Garden, Large and Small Lake, Lookout Loft Treehouse, Natural Areas, Main Fountain Garden, Meadow Garden, Ornamental Kitchen Garden, Oak and Conifer Knoll, Peirce&#x27;s Park, Peirce&#x27;s Woods, Peony Garden, Rose Arbor, Rose Garden, Student Exhibition Garden, Theatre Garden, Topiary Garden, Waterlily Display, and Wisteria Gardens.

There are more than 750 acres (300 hectares) of natural areas that surround Longwood&#x27;s formal gardens. Composed of more than 200 distinct plant communities and part of the Mid-Atlantic Piedmont, Longwood&#x27;s natural areas include mature and regenerating forests, reforestation plantings, native tall-grass and forb meadows, wetlands, and streams. The care of these natural areas prioritizes long-term health and native biodiversity using adaptive management and scientific research.

== Conservatory ==

Longwood&#x27;s first conservatory was built in 1914 when Pierre S. du Pont added an L-shaped extension to the original Peirce farmhouse, doubling its size. A conservatory connected the old and new wings.

Longwood&#x27;s second and largest conservatory, opened in 1921, is home to 4,600 types of plants and trees. Since its original construction began in 1919, it has undergone expansions and renovations. On Palm Sunday in 1966, the Palm House opened. This space was designed by Victorine and Samuel Homsey. The Palm House was closed in 2021 in preparation for &quot;Longwood Reimagined&quot;. In 1989, the new Silver Garden opened. This garden was designed by Isabelle Greene, and is meant to evoke the feeling of a dry desert stream bed.

In 1988, Roberto Burle Marx was asked to redesign the former Desert House in the Conservatory. Brazilian Burle Marx was one of the most celebrated landscape designers of the 20th century, and he had already visited and lectured at Longwood several times. The new garden was named the Cascade Garden and it opened in June 1992. The Cascade Garden was preserved and moved to its own custom-built glasshouse as part of &quot;Longwood Reimagined: A New Garden Experience&quot;.

In 1993, the 100-foot-long Mediterranean Garden opened in the Conservatory, designed by Ron Lutsko Jr. The Mediterranean Garden was closed in 2021 in preparation for &quot;Longwood Reimagined&quot;.

In January 2003, the East Conservatory was closed for renovation and redesign, with the main hall reopening to the public on October 29, 2005.

In 2007, a much larger Indoor Children&#x27;s Garden was opened in the Conservatory, replacing a small children&#x27;s garden that had been housed in the Conservatory since the 1980s.
In 2010, an indoor green wall, designed by British landscape architect Kim Wilkie was added to the Conservatory. This green wall contains 47,000 plants and was the largest green wall in North America when it opened. The Green Wall, which is the entrance way for a series of bathrooms, was voted America&#x27;s Best Restroom in 2014.

Main Conservatory gardens include: Acacia Passage, Camellia House, East Conservatory, Exhibition Hall, Garden Path, Green Wall, Indoor Children&#x27;s Garden, Orangery, Orchid House, and Silver Garden.

== Peirce-du Pont House ==
The Peirce-du Pont House dates from 1730 and is the oldest building at Longwood Gardens. It was the family homestead of the Peirce family until 1905 and then became the weekend residence of Pierre du Pont from 1906 until his death in 1954. It is now open to the public every day of the year and is included with general admission to the gardens.

This spacious country home resulted from five major periods of construction covering nearly 200 years. The original two-story brick farmhouse was built by Joshua Peirce in 1730 to replace a log cabin built in 1709. The brick pattern was Flemish bond brickwork with dark glazed headers and unglazed stretchers. The roof had a simple cornice and pent eaves protected the first floor windows and doors. In 1764, a two-story addition was made to the east end of the house and included a new dining room. The house was enlarged in 1824 adding a large addition to the north of the original structure. This building campaign doubled the size of the Peirce&#x27;s house. In 1909, Pierre du Pont modernized the house with a two-story addition to the north. Plumbing, electricity, and heating were added throughout the house.

The largest addition was built by du Pont in 1914 when a mirror image of the original farmhouse was added to the north. At the same time, the two wings were connected by Longwood&#x27;s first conservatory.

After Pierre du Pont&#x27;s death in 1954, the 1914 rooms were converted into administrative offices. Many of du Pont&#x27;s possessions were distributed to the du Pont family, although his garden books were retained and form the basis for Longwood&#x27;s horticultural library. Du Pont&#x27;s other books and his personal papers were transferred to what has become the Hagley Museum and Library near Wilmington, DE.

The Heritage Exhibit details Longwood&#x27;s historical and horticultural legacy. It draws upon the extensive photographic and manuscript resources now stored at the Hagley Museum and Library to show the entire 300-year history of the property. Although the rooms housing the exhibit no longer appear residential, their architectural features have been preserved intact and are visible to visitors, as are photos in many rooms showing the decor during du Pont&#x27;s occupancy.

== Plant collections ==

Longwood&#x27;s plant collections contain more than 13,500 taxa. Of those, Longwood has twelve core collections that are central to the mission of Longwood Gardens, and each core collection has a plan for its development, management, and display—devised and periodically reviewed Currently, four of the core collections are accredited by the American Public Gardens Association Plant Collection Network: &quot;Buxus&quot;, &quot;Chrysanthemum,&quot; &quot;Nymphaea,&quot; and Pierce&#x27;s trees. Legacy collections of Longwood Gardens are plant categories with specific uses that are integral to the historic display aesthetic of the Gardens. Additionally, Longwood Gardens is a Level IV ArbNet Accredited Arboretum and a member of the Botanic Gardens Conservation International.

Core Collections include:

* Boxwood (&quot;Buxus&quot;): This collection maintains genetic diversity not captured in any other boxwood collection of its kind.
*Chrysanthemum (&quot;Chrysanthemum)&quot;: The Chrysanthemum Collection includes historic Asian (primarily Japanese) cultivars of the genus used for bonsai, cascade, doll, and thousand bloom cultivation techniques and represents one of the largest collections of its kind.
*Peirce&#x27;s Trees: The first of its kind, the Peirce’s Trees Collection includes trees originally found in Peirce’s Park and are examples of trees cultivated in the Philadelphia region during the 19th century.
*Waterlily (&quot;Nymphaea&quot;): The Waterlily Collection includes horticultural selections of the genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot; developed by North American breeders during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.
*Bonsai: The Bonsai Collection at Longwood Gardens began in 1959 with a purchase of 13 trees from Yuji Yoshimura and, since that time, six curators have stewarded the collection and offered the necessary horticultural skills to continue the bonsai training. A recent donation from The Kennett Collection has led to the current collection that consists of more than 150 trees, 14 styles, and 14 plants from notable masters.
*Camellia (&quot;Camellia&quot;): The Camellia Collection includes species and cultivated selections of camellia hardy in the greater Philadelphia region. The collection maintains an active breeding program dedicated to producing hybrids with increased cold tolerance using selected accessions from evaluation plots.
*Magnolia (&quot;Magnolia&quot;): The Magnolia Collection includes species and horticultural selections of the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot; native to eastern North America.
*Oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;): The Oak Collection includes species and horticultural selections of the genus &quot;Quercus&quot;, native to eastern North America.
*Orchids: Orchids were a favorite plant group of Pierre S. and Alice du Pont—both founding members of the American Orchid Society. There are more than 4,500 orchid plants in the collection representing 2,500 taxa. A rotating selection of orchids is on display in Longwood&#x27;s Orchid House.
**Historical &quot;Cattleya&quot; Hybrids and Cultivars: The collection comprises historical (primarily pre-1950) hybrid and cultivar selections, many of which have become rare in commercial horticulture.
**&quot;Disa&quot;: Longwood Gardens was the first institution to flower &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; in the United States. Longwood&#x27;s collection is one of the only collections of this genus at a public garden in the US.
**US Native Orchids: This collection comprises endangered, rare, or threatened native species from Pennsylvania or the mid-Atlantic region. Plants are obtained through seed propagation and cultivation research. Select taxa were featured at the 2024 Chelsea Flower Show.
*Plants of Conservation Value: This core collection consists of plants that are rare, threatened, or endangered based on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List or NatureServe criteria. These plants are located in Longwood&#x27;s gardens, meadows, conservatories, or research greenhouses and represent plants grown for research, restoration, and display purposes. Examples of these plants found in the public garden areas include &quot;Hamamelis ovalis&quot; and &quot;Polemonium vanbruntiae.&quot;
*Rhododendron and Deciduous Azalea (&quot;Rhododendron&quot;): This collection focuses on the acquisition and evaluation of US native deciduous azalea species and their hybrids along with a diversity of evergreen rhododendrons.
*Water-platter (&quot;Victoria&quot;): This collection includes both species of the genus &quot;Victoria&quot; from documented wild origin or their progeny, and the hybrid (‘Longwood Hybrid’), which was first developed and is continually maintained at Longwood Gardens. Germplasm from this collection is distributed on a yearly basis to other botanical institutions, giving the collection a leading role in modern, world-wide &quot;Victoria&quot; conservation efforts.
Legacy Collections are plant categories with specific uses that are integral to the historic display aesthetic of Longwood Gardens.

Legacy Collections include:

* &quot;Clivia&quot;: The Clivia Collection represents the results of nearly 50 years of breeding work. The Clivia Breeding Program started in 1976 with the goal of producing a superior yellow-flowered clivia.
* Holly: The Holly Collection includes native species, cultivars, and hybrids of the genus &quot;Ilex&quot;. Hollies feature prominently throughout the Gardens and natural lands. Three cultivars, &quot;Ilex&quot; × &quot;attenuata&quot; ‘Longwood Gold’, &quot;Ilex opaca&quot; ‘Longwood Gardens’, and &quot;Ilex serrata&quot; ‘Longwood Firefall’ were selected at Longwood Gardens and will be maintained in perpetuity.
* Iconic Floriculture: This collection includes plants that are technically difficult to grow and an essential part of Longwood’s seasonal displays. Examples of these include &quot;Plectranthus thyrsoideus&quot;, &quot;Echium candicans&quot; &#x27;Select Blue&#x27;, &quot;Echium wildpretii&quot;, &quot;Geranium maderense&quot;, and &quot;Allamanda cathartica&quot; ‘Hendersonii.’
* Iconic Garden and Conservatory Plants: This collection includes species and cultivars that are held only at Longwood Gardens, along with plants that are an essential part of Longwood&#x27;s permanent Conservatory display, difficult to obtain commercially, and are of conservation value. Examples of these include &quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot;, &quot;Encephalartos woodii&quot;, and &quot;Citrus&quot; &#x27;Oroblanco&#x27;.

== Science at Longwood ==
Since the 1950s, Longwood has advanced scientific understanding of the natural world, with a particular focus on preserving plant diversity, curating plant collections, developing innovative techniques for growing plants, maintaining healthy ecosystems, and continuing to study, refine, and maintain healthy soils.

== Performing arts ==
Longwood&#x27;s history as a performing arts venue coincides with the early history of the gardens. The first of Pierre S. du Pont&#x27;s formal Gardens, the Flower Garden Walk, inspired him to host garden parties that often featured musical entertainment and fireworks.

Du Pont debuted his Open Air Theatre at such a garden party in 1914. By 1915, he had installed simple fountains in the stage floor, based on the Villa Gori theater he had visited in Italy. The Theatre was expanded in 1927 to include illuminated fountains in the stage floor and a 10-foot water curtain at its front. The 1,500-seat Open Air Theatre marked its 100th anniversary in 2014, having hosted more than 1,500 performances over the years, including theater troupes, Broadway-style musicals pageants, choruses, and the United States Marine Band. It continues to serve as a venue for summer performances.

In addition to using the Open Air Theatre, Longwood has experimented with a variety of performances in outdoor gardens—Indian sitar music set in the Italian Water Garden, Shakespearean theater staged on the Main Fountain Garden balcony, and modern dance choreographed for Peirce&#x27;s Park.

Longwood&#x27;s performance schedule expanded over time to become year-round, made possible by its indoor venues—the Ballroom and Exhibition Hall, both in the Conservatory. The Ballroom re-opened in October 2005 after extensive renovations. It was originally constructed in 1929 to house Longwood&#x27;s pipe organ and to serve as a venue for concerts, lectures, and dinners, a tradition that continues today. The Ballroom is architecturally unique for its parquet floor, fabric-paneled walls, and ceiling made of 1,104 panes of rose-colored etched glass.

The Exhibition Hall has hosted hundreds of performing artists, including the Meyer Davis dance band, Metropolitan Opera sopranos, John Philip Sousa, and South African vocal groups. The bougainvillea trained on the pillars and walls is the original planting from the 1920s. Once used by the du Ponts for dances and dinner parties, the sunken marble floor is typically flooded with a few inches of water to reflect seasonal displays. The floor is periodically drained to continue the tradition of hosting performances and events in this space.

=== Organ ===
The resident Longwood Organ is a 10,010 pipe instrument designed by Longwood organist-in-residence Firmin Swinnen, a Belgian musician who moved to the US in 1916 and became a prominent theater organist in New York City. The organ&#x27;s pipes filled fourteen railway freight cars, and they needed a 72-horsepower (54 kW) blower motor to supply the wind pressure; the instrument was the largest pipe organ ever installed in a private residence. Pierre du Pont ordered this massive Aeolian organ in 1929 to replace the previous organ of 3,650 pipes, which he donated to the University of Delaware where it stayed until 1964. The four-manual organ plays into the Longwood ballroom and can be heard throughout the Conservatory when adjoining window panels are opened. Its pipes may be viewed from the rear through glass panels in Longwood&#x27;s organ museum. The Longwood Organ underwent a restoration that began in 2004 and was completed in January 2011. The Longwood Gardens International Organ Competition welcomes the organ world&#x27;s brightest young talents to compete on the Longwood Organ for the largest cash prize of any organ competition in the world.

== Carillon ==

In 1929, Pierre du Pont constructed Longwood&#x27;s 61-foot-tall stone Chimes Tower based on a similar structure he had seen in France. He purchased the largest set of tower chimes he could find from the J.C. Deagan Company of Chicago after first borrowing one chime to test its carrying power. Twenty-five tubular chimes were installed in the upper tower chamber and du Pont installed a switch in the Peirce-du Pont House so he could activate the chimes from his residence. These were replaced by an electronic carillon in 1956, and finally by a 62-cast-bell Eijsbouts carillon from the Netherlands installed in 2001.

Visitors also enjoy live concerts in the summer and fall.

== Seasonal attractions ==

While there are many art and music events at Longwood Gardens throughout the year, there are five major periods of time where the entire gardens have an overarching theme. Those five themes and their approximate dates are:

* Winter Wonder – starts mid-January
* Spring Blooms – starts at the beginning of April
* Festival of Fountains – starts early May through October
* Autumn&#x27;s Colors – starts in early September and finishes with the Chrysanthemum festival
* A Longwood Christmas – starts prior to Thanksgiving and finishes the first week of January

<text>Thomas Hamilton (17897 December 1842) was a Scottish soldier and author.

==Life==
He was born in Pisa, Tuscany, the second son of William Hamilton (1758–1790), professor of anatomy and botany at Glasgow. He was the younger brother of metaphysician Sir William Hamilton (1788–1856). Their father died a few months after Thomas was born.

After preliminary education at Glasgow, he was placed in 1801 as a pupil with the Rev. Dr. Home, in Chiswick, England, and some months later with the Rev. Dr. Scott, Hounslow, also in England. For several months in 1803, he was with Dr. Sommers at Mid Calder, Midlothian, preparatory to entering Glasgow University, where he matriculated the following November. He studied there for three years, proving himself an able if not very diligent student. His close college companion, of whom he saw little in later life, was Michael Scott, the author of &quot;Tom Cringle&#x27;s Log&quot;.

Hamilton&#x27;s bias was towards the army, and in 1810, after fully showing his incapacity for business in Glasgow and Liverpool, he got a commission in the 29th regiment. Twice on active service in the Peninsula, he received a serious wound in the thigh from a musket bullet at the Battle of Albuera. He was also in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick with his regiment, which at length was sent to France as part of the army of occupation.

About 1818, Hamilton retired, as a captain, on half-pay, fixing his headquarters at Edinburgh. He became a valued member of the &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; writers. He was specially complimented in the song of personalities in the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot; for February 1826 (Noctes, i. 89). James Hogg in his &quot;Autobiography&quot; credits him with a considerable share in some of the &quot;ploys&quot; led by John Gibson Lockhart.

Hamilton married in 1820 Annette Montgomery Campbell, daughter of late Archibald Montgomery Campbell, Esq, of Upper Wimpole Street, private Secretary to Governor Campbell, and for several summers he and his wife lived at Lockhart&#x27;s cottage of Chiefs wood, near Abbotsford House, Sir Walter Scott finding them very congenial neighbours and friends. In 1829, Captain and Mrs. Hamilton went to Italy, and at the end of the year Mrs. Hamilton died and was buried at Florence.

Some time after his return, Hamilton visited America, bringing back materials for a book on the Americans. Marrying a second time, the widow of Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, bart., governor of the Mauritius, he settled at John Wilson&#x27;s former house, Elleray, and saw much of Wordsworth, whom he was one of the first Scotsmen to appreciate. Visiting the continent with his wife, Hamilton was seized with paralysis at Florence, and he died at Pisa of a second attack 7 December 1842. He was buried at Florence beside his first wife.

==Works==
Hamilton&#x27;s novel &quot;Cyril Thornton&quot; appeared in 1827. It is partly autobiographical, with Hamilton&#x27;s early impressions of Scottish university life and Glasgow citizens when he could call Govan &quot;a pretty and rural village&quot;, and his military experiences. The book went through three editions in the author&#x27;s lifetime, and was one of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Standard Novels&quot;.

In 1829, Hamilton published &quot;Annals of the Peninsular Campaign&quot;. His &quot;Men and Manners in America&quot; appeared in 1833.

Craig Lamont has placed Thomas Hamilton within a &quot;Glasgow School&quot; of early nineteenth century Scottish novelists, along with John Galt and Michael Scott.

<text>Anti-Scrunti Faction were an American queercore punk trio from Boulder, Colorado, United States.
The band made their first appearance in 1984 on the Restless Records compilation LP entitled &quot; FlipSide Vinyl Fanzine Volume 1&quot;, assembled by the fanzine &quot;Flipside&quot;, with the song &quot;Big Women&quot;. In 1985, Anti-Scrunti Faction released &quot;A Sure Fuck&quot;, a single on Unclean Records. Appearing on the extended single are Leslie Mah, bass and vocals, Tracie Thomas, guitar and vocals, Sarah Bibb on drums for two songs and Eric Van Leuven on drums for the remaining four. Later that same year the album &quot;Damsels In Distress&quot; came out on Flipside Records. The artists&#x27; names are intentionally obscured on the album: the guitarist is listed as T. Thomas and the drummer is only named as &quot;E&quot;. As on the single, these musicians are Tracie Thomas on guitar and Eric Van Leuven on drums. Credited as L. Mah, Leslie Mah again plays bass and sings.

After Anti-Scrunti Faction broke up, Leslie Mah moved to San Francisco and joined Tribe 8, regarded as one of the seminal queercore bands. However, Anti-Scrunti Faction continues to be popular among fans of old-school punk and fans of Tribe 8. The song &quot;Slave to my Estrogen&quot; is a stand-out favorite for radio airplay. In 1998, Tribe 8 recast &quot;Slave To My Estrogen&quot; as &quot;Estrofemme&quot; for their &quot;Role Models For AmeriKKKa&quot; album on Alternative Tentacles.

Anti-Scrunti Faction, also known by the initials A.S.F., were one of the bands to be featured in the first queercore zine, &quot;J.D.s&quot;. They also appeared in the film &quot;The Yo-Yo Gang&quot; by G.B. Jones. Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas starred in the movie, and also performed the song &quot;Frat Boy&quot;, from their single.

<doc id="431813" wikidata="Q6115950" url="?curid=431813" title="Jack and Jill">
<text>&quot;Jack and Jill&quot; (sometimes &quot;Jack and Gill&quot;, particularly in earlier versions) is a traditional English nursery rhyme. The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the commonest tune and its variations as number 10266, although it has been set to several others. The original rhyme dates back to the 18th century and different numbers of verses were later added, each with variations in the wording. Throughout the 19th century new versions of the story were written featuring different incidents. A number of theories continue to be advanced to explain the rhyme&#x27;s historical origin.

==Text==
The earliest version of the rhyme was in a reprint of John Newbery&#x27;s &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot;, thought to have been first published in London around 1765. The rhyming of &quot;water&quot; with &quot;after&quot; was taken by Iona and Peter Opie to suggest that the first verse might date from the 17th century. Jill was originally spelled Gill in the earliest version of the rhyme and the accompanying woodcut showed two boys at the foot of the hill.

Later the spelling was changed to Jill and more verses were added to carry the story further, of which the commonest are: 
As presented over the following century, the rhyming scheme of the six-line stanzas is &quot;AABCCB&quot; and they are trochaic in rhythm. Alternatively, when given the form of internally rhymed quatrains, this would be an example of the ballad form commonly used for nursery rhymes.

The phrase &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; existed earlier in England to indicate a boy and girl as a generic pair. It is so used, for example, in the proverb &quot;Every Jack (shall/must) have his Jill&quot;, to which there are references in two plays by William Shakespeare dating from the 1590s. The compress of vinegar and brown paper to which Jack resorted after his fall was a common home cure used to heal bruises.

==New versions==
Though approximately the words above are what have survived of the nursery rhyme to the present, their sense is preserved at the start of a 15-stanza chapbook, &quot;Jack &amp; Jill and Old Dame Gill&quot;, published in 1806. The work dates from the period when children&#x27;s literature was beginning to shift from instruction to fun in the wake of the success of &quot;Old Mother Hubbard&quot; and kindred works. This change of emphasis was signalled by the book&#x27;s coloured illustrations and introductory epigraph: &quot;Read it who will, They’ll laugh their fill&quot;. In this version the trio of Jack, Jill, and their mother Dame Gill experience further mishaps involving the dog Ball, an attack from a goat, falls from a see-saw, a swing and a pig, followed by a parental whipping for getting dirty. Many pirated editions of the work followed from both London and provincial presses, accompanied by black and white as well as coloured woodcuts. Sometimes there were several different editions from the same press, such as, for example, the Banbury editions of John Golby Rusher (1784–1877) between 1835 and 1845. The wording also varied in these, and there were multiplications of the creatures involved in the adventures of the three protagonists – a donkey, a reindeer, a bull, a goose and a camel.
As the decades advanced there were changes in form as well as wording. An 1840s edition from Otley, titled &quot;The adventures of Jack &amp; Jill and old Dame Jill&quot;, was written in longer and more circumstantial quatrains of between ten and twelve syllables, rhymed AABB. Among other changes in the poem, Jack&#x27;s injuries are treated, not with vinegar and brown paper, but &quot;spread all over with sugar and rum&quot;.

There were also radical changes in the telling of the story in America. Among the &quot;Juvenile Songs&quot; rewritten and set to music by Fanny E. Lacy (Boston 1852) was a six-stanza version of Jack and Jill. Having related their climb and fall from the hill, the rest of the poem is devoted to a warning against social climbing: &quot;By this we see that folks should be/ Contented with their station,/ And never try to look so high/ Above their situation.&quot; There is a similar tendency to moral instruction in the three &quot;chapters&quot; of &quot;Jack and Jill, for old and young&quot; by Lawrence Augustus Gobright (1816–1879), published in Philadelphia in 1873. There the pair have grown up to be a devoted and industrious married couple; the fall is circumstantially explained and the cure afterwards drawn out over many, many quatrains. In the introduction to his work, Gobright makes the claim that the two-stanza version of the original nursery rhyme was, in earlier editions, followed by two more:

No such verses are found in English editions, although they do appear in a later American edition of &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s nursery rhymes, tales and jingles&quot; (New York 1902).

Yet another American variation on the story appeared in the &quot;Saint Nicholas Magazine&quot;. This was Margaret Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A New Jack and Jill&quot;, in which the brother and sister constantly return with an empty bucket because they have not noticed that there is a hole in it. Clifton Bingham (1859–1913) followed it with &quot;The New Jack and Jill&quot;, which appeared in the children&#x27;s album &quot;Fun and Frolic&quot; (London and New York, 1900), illustrated by Louis Wain. Here there is a return to the six-line stanza form: 

But the cow objects and chases them down again. The exclamatory style used in all three stanzas replicates that used only in the sixth stanza of the popular &quot;Jack and Jill and Old Dame Gill&quot;.

==Musical settings==

A musical arrangement of the rhyme as a catch by Charles Burney was published in 1777, at a date earlier than any still existing copy of &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot;. But the melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded with the three stanza version by the composer and nursery lore collector James William Elliott in his &quot;National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs&quot; (1870), which was published in America as &quot;Mother Goose Set to Music&quot; the following year. And in 1877 the single-stanza version illustrated by Walter Crane appeared in &quot;The Baby&#x27;s Opera&quot; (London 1877), which described itself as &quot;a book of old rhymes in new dresses, the music by the earliest masters&quot;.

The Victorian composer Alfred James Caldicott, who distinguished himself by setting several nursery rhymes as ingenious part songs, adapted &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; as one in 1878. These works were described by the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; as a &quot;humorous admixture of childish words and very complicated music…with full use of contrast and the opportunities afforded by individual words&quot;. Among American adaptations of his work for female voices, there were settings by E. M. Bowman (New York, 1883) and Charles R. Ford (Boston, 1885). In Canada, Spencer Percival was responsible for a part-song of his own for four voices, first performed in 1882.

Sigmund Spaeth was eventually to have fun with the rhyme by adapting it to a number of bygone musical styles as &quot;The musical adventures of Jack &amp; Jill in Words &amp; Music: A Book of Burlesques&quot;, (Simon and Schuster, 1926). These included a Handel aria, Italian operatic and Wagnerian versions. Later on the English composer Geoffrey Hartley (1906–1992) set the original as a chamber piece for horn and two bassoons, or for wind trio (1975), and later reset it as a bassoon trio.

==Interpretations==

There are several theories concerning the origin of the rhyme. Most such explanations postdate the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. S. Baring-Gould suggested that the rhyme is related to a story in the 13th-century Icelandic &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; in which the brother and sister Hjuki and Bil were stolen by the Moon while drawing water from a well, to be seen there to this day.

Other suggestions rooted in history include a reference to the executions of Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley in 1510, or to a marriage negotiation conducted by Thomas Wolsey in 1514. Alternatively it has been taken to satirise the attempt by King Charles I of England to raise extra revenue by ordering that the volume of a Jack (1/8 pint) be reduced, while the tax remained the same. In consequence of this, the Gill (a quarter pint in liquid measure) &quot;came tumbling after&quot;.

There is also a belief in Somerset that the rhyme records events in the village of Kilmersdon when a local girl became pregnant; the putative father is said to have died from a rockfall and the woman afterwards died in childbirth. The local surname of Gilson is therefore taken to derive from Gill&#x27;s son.

A more prosaic origin of the rhyme is suggested by historian Edward A. Martin, who notes that pails of water may readily have been collected from dew ponds, which were located on the tops of hills.

<text>A pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or still used to distill liquors such as whisky or brandy. In modern (post-1850s) practice, they are not used to produce rectified spirit, because they do not separate congeners from ethanol as effectively as other distillation methods. Pot stills operate on a batch distillation basis (as contrasted with Coffey or column stills, which operate on a continuous basis). Traditionally constructed from copper, pot stills are made in a range of shapes and sizes depending on the quantity and style of spirit desired.

Spirits distilled in pot stills top out between 60 and 80 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) after multiple distillations. Because of this relatively low level of ABV concentration, spirits produced by a pot still retain more of the flavour from the wash than distillation practices that reach higher ethanol concentrations.

Under European law and various trade agreements, cognac (a protected term for a variety of brandy produced in the region around Cognac, France) and any Irish or Scotch whisky labelled as &quot;pot still whisky&quot; or &quot;malt whisky&quot; must be distilled using a pot still.

== Method of operation ==

During first distillation, the pot still (or &quot;wash still&quot;) is filled about two-thirds full of a fermented liquid (or wash) with an alcohol content of about 7–12%. In the case of whiskey distillation, the liquid used is a beer, while in the case of brandy production, it is a base wine. The pot still is then heated so that the liquid boils. 

The liquid being distilled is a mixture of mainly water and alcohol, along with smaller amounts of other by-products of fermentation (called congeners), such as aldehydes and esters. At sea level, alcohol (ethanol) has a normal boiling point of while pure water boils at . As alcohol has a lower boiling point, it is more volatile and evaporates at a higher rate than water. Hence the concentration of alcohol in the vapour phase above the liquid is higher than in the liquid itself.

During distillation, this vapour travels up the &quot;swan neck&quot; at the top of the pot still and down the &quot;lyne arm&quot;, after which it travels through &quot;the condenser&quot; (also known as the &quot;worm&quot;), where it is cooled to yield a distillate with a higher concentration of alcohol than the original liquid. After one such stage of distillation, the resulting liquid, called &quot;low wines&quot;, has a concentration of about 25–35% alcohol by volume.

These &quot;low wines&quot; can be distilled again in a pot still to yield a distillate with a higher concentration of alcohol. In the case of many Irish whiskeys, the spirit is distilled for a third time. However, cognac and most single malt Scotch whiskies are distilled only twice.

A still used for the redistillation of already-distilled products (especially in the United States) is known as a &quot;doubler&quot; named after its approximate effect on the level of the distillation purity. Distillers from the early 1800s with sufficient resources to operate both a primary still and a separate doubler would typically use a smaller still for the doubler (typically about half the capacity) than for the first distillation.

An alternative way to reach an increased distillation purity without a full second stage of distillation is to put another pot (often a passive pot i.e., without an external heat source) between the pot still and the cooling worm. Such a pot is known as a &quot;thumper&quot; named after the sound made by the vapour as it bubbles through a pool of liquid in the thumper. The distinction between a thumper and a doubler is that a thumper receives its input as a vapour prior to cooling, while the intake of a doubler is an already-condensed liquid.

During distillation, the initial and final portions of spirit which condense (with the first portions termed the &quot;foreshots&quot; and &quot;heads&quot; and the final parts called the &quot;tails&quot; and &quot;feints&quot;) may be captured separately from that in the centre or &quot;heart&quot; of the distillation and may be discarded. This is because these portions of the distillate may contain high concentrations of congeners (which it may be desirable to keep out of the final distillate for reasons of style, taste and toxicity). For example, the presence of pectin in the wash (e.g., due to using a mash made from fruit) may result in the production of methanol (a.k.a. wood alcohol), which has a lower boiling point than ethanol and thus would be more concentrated in the foreshots. Methanol is toxic and at sufficient concentrations, it can cause blindness and fatal kidney failure. It is especially important to discard the initial foreshots, while a small amount of the near-centre heads and tails are often included in the final product for their effect on the flavour.

== History ==

The modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.
The largest pot still ever used was in the Old Midleton Distillery, County Cork, Ireland. Constructed in 1825, it had a capacity of and is no longer in use. As of 2014 the largest pot stills in use are in the neighbouring New Midleton Distillery, County Cork, Ireland, and have a capacity of .

Components of a traditional pot still:
* Pot – where the wash is heated 
* Swan Neck – where the vapours rise and reflux 
* Lyne Arm – transfers the vapour to the condenser
* Condenser or worm – cools the vapour to yield distillate

<doc id="431819" wikidata="Q410661" url="?curid=431819" title="U.S. Route 81">
<text>U.S. Route 81 or U.S. Highway 81 (US 81) is a major north–south U.S. highway that extends for in the central United States and is one of the original United States Numbered Highways established in 1926 by the American Association of State Highway Officials.

The route of US 81 follows that of the old Meridian Highway (so called because it roughly followed the Sixth Principal Meridian of the US Public Land Survey System) which dates back as early as 1911. The highway has alternately (and unofficially) been known as part of the Pan-American Highway. In the segment in the state of Oklahoma, the highway closely corresponds to the old Chisholm Trail for cattle drives from Texas to railheads in Kansas in the 1860s and 1870s.

As of 2004, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is just north of Pembina, North Dakota, at the Canadian border. At this point, it is routed along Interstate 29 (I-29) and continues northward into Manitoba on Highway 75, which leads to Winnipeg.

Its southern terminus is in Fort Worth, Texas, at an intersection with I-35W and US 287. Between the inception of the numbered highway system in 1926 through 1991, US 81&#x27;s southern terminus was at the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas. In 1991, the terminus was moved to San Antonio. The route was shortened to its present length of in 1993, when the terminus was moved to Fort Worth. In both cases, the dropped portions of US 81 were replaced by I-35. Portions of former US 81 south of Fort Worth continue to exist as business loops of I-35; a section from Hillsboro to Fort Worth exists as State Highway 81.

The decommissioning of portions of US 81 that have been displaced by concurrent Interstate Highways means that US 81 no longer extends from the Canadian border to the Mexican border, while one of its auxiliary routes, US 281 does extend to both borders. As a result of decommissioning portions of US 81, the length of US 81 is actually miles shorter than US 281.

==Route description==

===Texas===

US 81 at its inception in 1926 followed the route of State Highway 2, which began in Laredo and passed through San Antonio, Austin, Waco, and Fort Worth before passing over the Red River into Oklahoma north of Ringgold. The 1936 Official Map of the Highway System of Texas clearly shows the route labeled both as US 81 and SH 2. It was cosigned with US 83 for from Laredo to south of Webb, with US 79 for from Austin north to Round Rock, and with US 77 for from Waco to Hillsboro. In 1940 US 287 was extended south into Texas, and a stretch from Fort Worth northwest to Bowie was cosigned with US 81. The summer 1941 Texas Highway Map shows this pairing, and the current southern terminus of US 81 is still cosigned with US 287.

The spring and summer 1949 Texas Highway Department Official Map designates the length of US 81 from Laredo to Fort Worth as part of the National System of Interstate Highways, but no numeric designation was given.

It was not until 1959 that parts of US 81 in Texas appeared on the Texas Official Highway Travel Map cosigned with I-35 shields. Succeeding maps reflect the slow completion of I-35 and I-35W over the stretch of US 81 between Laredo and Fort Worth, with the 1978-79 Texas Official Highway Travel Map showing only a section from Encinal north to south of Artesia Wells as incomplete, and the 1980 Texas Official Highway Travel Map showing that section completed. In 1980, US 81 was cosigned with I-35 and I-35W except where the Interstate bypassed towns, with US 81 providing the main route through town and then reconnecting with I-35 on the other side. The longest section of US 81 in 1980 not cosigned with the Interstate ran from I-35 in Hillsboro north to I-35W, just north of Grandview.

===Oklahoma===

Enid, El Reno, Chickasha, and Duncan are major Oklahoma towns on the highway; historically, the small town of Hennessey is notable. Among the elders throughout the small towns that are dotted along US 81 in Oklahoma, the sixth meridian is commonly known among the locals as the &quot;Indian Meridian&quot; but US 81 is not known as the &quot;Indian Meridian Highway&quot;. The El Reno tornado in May 2013, the largest tornado ever at 2.6 mi wide, also crossed US 81. The Indian Meridan is located some east and parallel of US 81. By pure coincidence, the Chisholm Trail of the post-Civil-War decades roughly followed along the corridor of present-day US 81; the region was not opened for settlement until several years after the cattle drives were discontinued; cultural memory harkened exclusively for many years to Indian Meridian Highway until recognition of the old cattle trail grew in the late 1900s.

===Kansas===

Nearly all of US 81 in Kansas is either freeway or expressway. The route enters Kansas as a two-lane near Caldwell. From South Haven to Wichita it closely parallels I-35, which is also known as the Kansas Turnpike in that area. After South Haven, the only town of any significance along US 81 until Wichita is Wellington, which is just west of the Turnpike along US 160.

At Wichita, US 81 joins I-135. The two highways remain joined until Salina; I-135&#x27;s mile markers take precedence. I-135 ends at I-70 but US 81 continues as a freeway to Minneapolis, then as an expressway passing through Concordia before exiting the state north of Belleville.

The alignment of US 81 from Wichita to Salina prior to the completion I-135 is fully intact. The prior alignment ran from where current US 81 breaks off for I-135 at 47th street, north through Wichita along Broadway street. Old US 81 roughly parallels I-135 to Newton. Old US 81 follows current K-15 through Newton between an interchange with US 50 and Hesston Road, where old US 81 breaks northwest onto Hesston road. Old US 81 then travels through the small Kansas towns of Hesston, Moundridge, and Elyria, before turning to the north, and going through the town of McPherson as Main Street. North of McPherson, old US 81 continues to Lindsborg, where it follows current K-4 until an interchange with I-135. Old US 81 passes under I-135 and continues to parallel it about to the east. Old US 81 then travels through Assaria, where it encounters another brief overlap with K-4 and K-104. Old US 81 continues through the city of Salina as Ninth Street. North of Salina, Old US 81 encounters brief overlaps with K-143 and K-18. Old US 81 follows K-106 to an interchange with current US 81, where the two alignments are joined back together.

From Salina to the Nebraska state line, the highway is named the Frank Carlson Memorial Highway, in honor of the late Senator Frank Carlson. Senator Carlson was a native of Concordia who represented Kansas in the United States Senate from 1951 until 1969. Before serving in the Senate, he was Governor of Kansas from 1947 until 1950.

===Nebraska===
US 81 enters Nebraska as an expressway at Chester and continues as an expressway to York, where the highway intersects I-80. After a two-lane section going north from York and an overlap with Nebraska Highway 92 (N-92), US 81 again becomes an expressway at N-64. This expressway section passes through Columbus and Norfolk. North of Norfolk, US 81 is a two-lane, undivided highway which passes through no towns before exiting the state in Cedar County.

===South Dakota===
US 81 enters South Dakota by a Missouri River crossing, via the Discovery Bridge at Yankton. Its junction with I-90 is south of Salem. US 81 passes near Madison before it joins with I-29 at Watertown. The two highways remain concurrent through the rest of the state, leaving South Dakota near New Effington.

The South Dakota section of US 81, with the exception of a concurrency with US 14, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-179.

===North Dakota===

US 81 enters North Dakota concurrently with I-29. It is paired with I-29 from the South Dakota border, passing through Fargo, to the north side of Grand Forks. There it splits off to the northwest, passing through the city of Manvel. It parallels I-29, passing through the town of Grafton before joining North Dakota Highway 5 (ND 5) near Cavalier. It rejoins I-29 and continues to the Canadian border at Pembina. The original route of US 81 survives as ND 127 and County Road 81 (CR 81) in Richland, Cass, Traill, and Grand Forks counties.

==History==

US 81 started out as the Meridian Highway, an auto trail organized in 1911 to connect Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico near the Sixth Principal Meridian. The southern terminus, initially at Galveston, was later moved to Laredo, where it would connect with a proposed extension to Mexico City (later built as part of the Pan-American Highway). Five of the six states along the route assigned a single number to the highway, mostly changing at the state line. (Kansas did not number its highways until 1926.) Planning to replace these designations—and the Meridian Highway name—began in 1925, when the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states; the entire Meridian Highway was assigned US 81. The new number was officially adopted in late 1926.

The Interstate Highway System was approved in 1956, and included several routes that would replace much of US 81. I-35 followed the corridor from Laredo north to Wichita, where I-35 turned northeast towards Kansas City, with a branch—I-35W—continuing parallel to US 81 to Salina, Kansas. Between Fort Worth, Texas, and South Haven, Kansas, I-35 did not directly replace US 81, instead following US 77 through Oklahoma City, but replaced it as a long-distance highway. From Salina north through Nebraska, the US 81 corridor was not part of the Interstate Highway System, but I-29 began at Kansas City, gradually heading northwest and intersecting US 81 at Watertown, South Dakota, then following it north to the Canadian border. The portion through northern Kansas and Nebraska remains an important regional corridor and was proposed as a potential Interstate in the 1960s, but by the late 1970s, the rest had been mostly replaced by I-35 and I-29 for non-local traffic. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved a truncation in 1991, changing the southern terminus from Laredo to north of Fort Worth and removing long overlaps with and short sections parallel to I-35.
The portion of US 81 between Grandview, Texas, and Hillsboro, Texas, that was not part of I-35W was renamed SH 81.

Business US 81 in San Antonio was replaced by Loop 368 and Loop 353. The north side (Loop 368) traveled down Broadway and Austin Highway while the south side (Loop 353) was Nogalitos and Laredo Highway. When it was replaced, they renamed the street New Laredo Highway.

Old portions of US 81 in various parts of North Dakota are now county roads. The current US 81 in these areas is cosigned with I-29.

Completion of the four-lane section of US 81 between Salina and Minneapolis, Kansas, occurred in 1971. 

Between Wichita and Salina, Kansas, old sections of US 81 are now county roads and short sections of state highways. The current US 81 in this area is cosigned with I-135. In McPherson County, the old alignment of US 81 is signed as Business US 81.

<text>A column still, also called a continuous still, patent still or Coffey still, is a variety of still consisting of two columns. Column stills can produce rectified spirit (95% ABV).

==Description==
The first column (called the analyzer) in a column still has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength.

A column still is an example of a fractional distillation, in that it yields a narrow fraction of the distillable components. This technique is frequently employed in chemical synthesis; in this case, the component of the still responsible for the separation is a fractionating column.

A continuous still can, as its name suggests, sustain a constant process of distillation. This, along with the ability to produce a higher concentration of alcohol in the final distillate, is its main advantage over a pot still, which can only work in batches. Continuous stills are charged with preheated feed liquor at some point in the column. Heat (usually in the form of steam) is supplied to the base of the column. Stripped (approximately alcohol-free) liquid is drawn off at the base, while alcoholic spirits are condensed after migrating to the top of the column.

Column stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Distillation by column still is the traditional method for production of Armagnac, although distillation by pot still is allowed. The use of column stills for the distillation of Cognac is forbidden, although they may be used for other types of brandy, likewise malt Scotch Whiskies must be distilled in a pot still. Distillation by column stills is permitted for Calvados AOC and Calvados Domfrontais. Calvados Pays d&#x27;Auge AOC is required to be distilled by pot still.

===Difference between pot still and column still===
Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapour, which is low in alcohol, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column. The temperature of each successively higher stage is slightly lower than the previous stage, so the vapour in equilibrium with the liquid at each stage is progressively more enriched with alcohol. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 96%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water. Further enrichment is only possible by absorbing the remaining water using other means, such as hydrophilic chemicals or azeotropic distillation, or a column of 3A molecular sieves, like 3A zeolite.

==History==

In the early 1800s, a number of different scientists, engineers, and businessmen contributed to the development of a variety of different continuous distillation apparatuses. Several of these early developers were French, spurred on by a prize offered by Napoleon to improve sugar beet development and fermentation, in an effort to reduce reliance on British imports. These early French stills were suited to the production of wine, but deficient in the processing of the residual solids found in whiskey mashes. These French designs were further developed and improved upon by a number of Irish, British, and German contributors, to allow for use in the distillation of whiskey and other liquids. The column still is also called &quot;la Colonne Belge&quot; or the Belgian Column because it was first introduced and used for commercial purposes in Flanders, Belgium in 1828. Notable contributors included:

===Jean‐Édouard Adam===
In 1805, Jean‐Édouard Adam developed a discontinuous fractional distillation apparatus.

===Isaac Bérard===
In 1806, Bérard developed a device to allow for partial condensation

===Jean‐Baptiste Cellier‐Blumenthal===
The work of Adam and Bérard, focused on two key principles:

# the enrichment of a low boiling component in the rising vapour 
# the enrichment of the vapour by partial condensation and reflux into the still

In 1813, Jean‐Baptiste Cellier‐Blumenthal (1768–1840), built upon and combined these ideas, and patented the first continuously operating distillation column. This still had a pot still type-kettle, but replaced the traditional lyne arm and cooling worm with a vertical column of perforated plates. Although many of the details of Cellier-Blumenthal&#x27;s column were improved upon in later years, the general concept was to provide the basis for future column still designs. In 1820, he moved to Koekelberg in Brussels, Belgium where he did the first experiments with his column still. The Belgians began distilling with his design soon after as they wanted to innovate in their distilleries.

=== Heinrich Pistorius ===
In 1817, Heinrich Pistorius, a German, patented a still for the distillation of alcohol from potato mash. The Pistorius still produced spirit with an alcohol content of about 60-80%, and was widely used across Germany until the 1870s.

===Sir Anthony Perrier===
Sir Anthony Perrier (1770–1845) was operator of the Spring Lane distillery (Glen distillery) in Cork, Ireland from 1806.
In 1822, he patented one of Europe&#x27;s first continuous whiskey stills. The still included a labyrinth of partitions, which allowed the wash to flow gradually and continuously over the heat, with increased contact between the vapour and liquid phases of the distillate. In addition, the still contained &quot;baffles&quot;, similar to modern bubble trays. This meant small portions of fermented &quot;wash&quot; received the greatest amount of heat, thereby increasing the amount of potable alcohol that was collected.

=== Jean-Jacques St. Marc ===
In 1823, Jean-Jacques St. Marc, a French veterinary surgeon attached to Napoleon&#x27;s personal staff, moved to England where he sought investors in his &quot;Patent Distillery Company&quot;, which was to distill potato brandy. The company erected a distillery at Vauxhall, called the Belmont Distillery, but it proved unsuccessful. During which time, St. Marc worked on developing a continuous distillation apparatus. In 1827 he was granted a patent, and moved back to France. The still was later used successfully in England, Ireland, and the West Indies.

===Robert Stein===
In 1828, Scotsman, Robert Stein, patented a continuous still that fed the &quot;wash&quot; through a series of interconnected pots. Piston strokes were used to vapourise the wash and feed it into a horizontal cylinder which was divided into a series of compartments using cloth. The Stein still offered improved fuel efficiency compared with the traditional pot still and was the first continuous still to be employed commercially in Scotland, finding use at the Kirkliston (1828), Cameron Bridge (1830), Yoker (1845), and Glenochil (1845) distilleries. However, as the still did not allow for siphoning off of the pungent fusel oils, the spirit produced was not highly rectified, and still needed to be stopped frequently for cleaning.

===Aeneas Coffey===
In 1830, Irishman Aeneas Coffey patented the two-column, continuous distillation apparatus which bears his name, versions of which are now ubiquitous across the distilling industries. The still allowed for the production of alcoholic spirit with an ethanol content of greater than 90%, though modern versions can achieve about 95%.

Educated at Dublin&#x27;s Trinity College, Coffey had ample opportunities to observe all manner of still designs having worked as a distillery excise tax collector for a quarter of a century.

Coffey&#x27;s early designs, based on modifications to the Cellier-Blumenthal still, were unsuccessful. Being made of iron, they were attacked by the acids in the hot distillate, resulting in a poor spirit. However, his final design, which incorporated design elements from Perrier, Fournier, and Saint Marc, was to prove successful.

In his patent application, Coffey claimed that his design made three new improvements over previous designs:

# Forcing the wash to pass rapidly through a pipe or pipes of small diameter, during the time it is acquiring heat and before it reaches its boiling temperature. 
# Causing the wash, after it has come in contact with the vapours, to flow into a continued and uninterrupted stream over numerous metallic plates, furnished with valves
# The method of ascertaining whether or not the wash exhausted of its alcohol by means of the apparatus herein described or any similar apparatus, whereby the vapour to be tried undergoes a process of analyzation or rectification, and is deprived of much of its aqueous part before it is submitted to trial.

In addition, the design introduced perforated trays as sieve structures for vapour liquid contact.

This new continuous distillation method produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills, without the need for cleaning after each batch was made.

As the reciprocating steam engines of the time were unable to feed the still with the necessary high temperature/pressure steam, it took some time for the Coffey still to dominate the industry. However, with technological improvements, most notably the introduction of steam regulators in 1852, the Coffey still found widespread use in alcohol production across Europe and the Americas. Although, notably, it found resistance within Irish whiskey industry, then the dominant force in global whiskey production, who considered the high-strength spirit, to be inferior in taste profile to lower strength pot still distillate.

Within five years of receiving his patent, Coffey had enough orders to warrant the establishment of Aeneas Coffey &amp; Sons in London, a company that remains in operation today under the name John Dore &amp; Co Limited. He closed Dock Distillery four years later and devoted all of his time to building and installing stills in distilleries owned by others.

<text>The Ford Popular, often called the Ford Pop, is a car from Ford UK that was built in England between 1953 and 1962. When launched, it was Britain&#x27;s lowest priced car.

The name Popular was also used by Ford to describe its 1930s Y Type model. The Popular name was also later used on basic models of the Escort and Fiesta cars.


== Ford Popular 103E==
When production of the older Ford Anglia and Ford Prefect was stopped in 1953 the Popular was developed as a budget alternative, based on the old, pre-war style E494A Anglia. The E494A was, in turn, a facelift of the Anglia E04A, which was a facelifted version of the 7Y, itself a rebodied Model Y. Thus through several adjustments, updates and name changes, a design with provenance dating back to 1932 was produced by Ford for 27 years. It was powered by a Ford Sidevalve 1172 cc, , four-cylinder engine. The car was very basic. It had a single vacuum-powered wiper, no heater, vinyl trim, and very little chrome; even the bumpers were painted, and the bakelite dashboard of the Anglia was replaced by a flat steel panel. The Popular 103E differed visually from the Anglia E494E in having smaller headlights and a lack of trim on the side of the bonnet. Early 103Es had the three spoke banjo type Anglia/Prefect steering wheel as stocks of these were used up, but most have a two spoke wheel similar to the 100E wheel but in brown. Early Populars also had the single centrally mounted tail/stop-lamp of the Anglia, but this changed to a two tail/stop lamp set up with the lamps mounted on the mudguards and a separate number plate lamp. In total, 155,340 Popular E103s were produced.

This car proved successful because, while on paper it was a sensible alternative to a clean, late-model used car, in practice there were no clean late-model used cars available in postwar Britain owing to the six-year halt in production caused by the Second World War. This problem was compounded by stringent export quotas that made obtaining a new car in the late 1940s and into the early 1950s difficult, and covenants forbidding new-car buyers from selling for up to three years after delivery. Unless the purchaser could pay the extra £100 or so for an Anglia 100E, Austin A30 or Morris Minor, the choice was the Popular or a pre-war car. Electrics were 6 volts, a provided starting handle often necessary. Braking was done by rod operated drums, and synchromesh was only on 2nd and top gear. The boot was accessed with a coach key, there was no heater or demister, and turn indication was performed by semaphors. Starting the car was done by pull-wire starter, and the carburetor was operated by manual choke. Also, there was no water pump, and engine cooling was done via thermosyphon. In short, this was very basic motoring.

In later years, these cars became popular as hot rods, starting in the late 1950s, when people started drag racing them due to their lightweight construction. This practice started in the United States with Ford&#x27;s 1932 Model B/18, while the Ford &quot;Pop&quot; as it was affectionately known became the definitive British hot rod – a reduced sized but readily available British alternative, a role it still plays today to a considerable extent.

A car tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1954 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 24.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £390 including taxes.

===In Australia===
The Popular 103E was available in Australia up to 1955 as a two-door coupe utility and also in chassis-cowl form to accept custom built bodywork. It utilised the 94 inch wheelbase of the Ford Prefect with 103E front panels. The utility was designated as 103E-67 and the chassis-cowl model as 103E-84. The Popular utility differed from its Anglia A494A utility predecessor in that the Popular did not have running boards whereas the Anglia did.

==Ford Popular 100E==

In 1959 the old Popular was replaced by a new version that was in production until 1962. Like the previous version it used a superseded Anglia body shell, this time that of the 100E, and it was powered by a strengthened 1172 cc sidevalve engine producing 36 bhp. The brakes were now hydraulic with drums all round. The new Popular offered 1,000 mile (1,500 km in metric countries) service intervals, like its predecessor, but it only had 13 grease points as against its predecessor&#x27;s 23 (or 28 for the pre-war cars). The basic model stripped out many fittings from the Anglia but there was a large list of extras available and also a De Luxe version which supplied many as standard. 126,115 Popular 100Es were built.

The &quot;Motor&quot; magazine tested a 100E in 1960 and found it to have a top speed of , acceleration from 0– in 19.6 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £494 including taxes with a comment that it was the lowest-priced orthodox saloon on the British Market.

In 1960, the manufacturer&#x27;s recommended retail price of £494 was equivalent to 26 weeks&#x27; worth of the average UK wage. The £100 charged in 1935 and the £1,299 charged for the Ford Escort Popular in 1975 both also amounted to 26 weeks&#x27; worth of average wage for the years in question. In the 1950s, however, the country had been undergoing a period of above average austerity: in 1953 the car&#x27;s £390 sticker price represented 40 weeks&#x27; worth of the average UK wage.


==Popular trim level==
In 1975 the Popular name was revived as a base trim level of the newly released Ford Escort Mk2. This model featured a standard 1.1 litre OHV Kent engine, 12-inch wheels with cross ply tyres and drum brakes all round. The 1975 Ford Escort Popular was the first Ford to carry the Popular name that also featured a heater as standard equipment. The &quot;Popular&quot; trim level proved long-standing across the Ford range, featuring on later Escorts and the Fiesta, from 1980 to 1991. A &#x27;Popular Plus&#x27; variant was also available.

==In popular culture==
Season 3, Episode 2 of Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus was titled &quot;Mr and Mrs Brian Norris&#x27; Ford Popular&quot; leading with a sketch featuring the aforenamed couple and their car which parodied documentaries of famous expeditions.

A 1960 Popular also appears in the music video for Phil Collins&#x27; Take Me Home.

<doc id="431838" wikidata="Q49755" url="?curid=431838" title="Liberal Democratic Party of Germany">
<text>The Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (, LDPD) was a political party in East Germany. Like the other allied bloc parties of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in the National Front, it had 52 representatives in the People&#x27;s Chamber.

==Foundation==
The history of the party dates back to 16 June 1945, when a Berlin-based group led by Waldemar Koch and his father-in-law Eugen Schiffer took the initiative in refounding the Weimar-era &quot;German Democratic Party&quot;. Koch was elected chair of the founding committee, with Wilhelm Külz as his deputy; the writer Franz Xaver Kappus joined the board as well. At first there were some conversations about forming a united centre-right democratic party with the Christian Democrats, but the idea was abandoned soon and the name was changed to Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberal-Demokratische Partei&quot;, LDP) before the party&#x27;s official founding on 5 July 1946.

It was first of all aimed at uniting Weimar Republic-era members of the German Democratic Party, German People&#x27;s Party and German National People&#x27;s Party. Unlike the East German Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Liberal Democratic Party was firmly for private ownership and opposed to nationalization of important private enterprises. Among the new anti-fascist parties, Liberal Democratic Party was the most anti-communist at the time.

After internal fighting and under pressure from Soviet authorities, Koch was replaced with the more pliable Wilhelm Külz in November 1945.

In the last free election, in 1946, the Liberal Democrats finished third, behind the SED and the CDU. At the end of 1948, during the culmination of their opposition to the SED seizure of power, the LDP had more than 200,000 members, 23% of whom were younger than 25.

==Unification attempts==

In July 1946, the LDP and the liberal parties in the Western Zones founded a joint Coordination committee with the aim of forming an All-Germany liberal party (&quot;Demokratische Partei Deutschlands&quot;, DPD). The founding of the Democratic Party of Germany began with a conference in Rothenburg ob der Tauber on 17 March 1947. Wilhelm Külz and Theodor Heuss (representing Western liberals) acted as co-chairmen. Such undertakings failed quickly, owing to Külz&#x27;s participation in the SED-sponsored German People&#x27;s Congress for Unity and Just Peace.

The failure of unification became imminent when at a session of the united leadership of DPD that took part on 18 January 1948 and which Külz refused to attend, Theodor Heuss argued that the Liberal Democrats&#x27; unwillingness to take any measures against Külz proved their commitment to &#x27;the Russian conception of German unity&#x27;. Arthur Lieutenant, the spokesman of LDP on the matter, declared that under those circumstances and concerning reproaches laid against East German liberals, any co-operation had been made impossible.

==A &quot;Blockpartei&quot;==

After 1949, it shared the same fate as the other legal East German parties. As a bloc party (&quot;Blockpartei&quot;) of the National Front it jettisoned its original ideology, acting as a &quot;helpmeet&quot; to the Communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). Another bloc party, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NDPD), appealed to almost the same social groups. In October 1951, the LDP was ordered to add the &quot;D&quot; for &quot;Germany&quot; (Deutschland) into its name in order to serve the SED&#x27;s all-German propaganda of that time.

LDPD member Johannes Dieckmann was the chairman of the Volkskammer from 1949 to 1969, and as such was ex officio vice president of the GDR during that time.

The central newspaper of LDPD used to be the daily &quot;Der Morgen&quot; (&quot;The Morning&quot;). 
Manfred Gerlach was the Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party from 1967 to his resignation in 1990. Gerlach had initially been a loyal partner of the SED, but began moving toward a more independent line in the 1980s. At an extraordinary party congress held 9–10 February 1990 in Dresden it returned to genuine liberal policies and dropped &quot;of Germany&quot; from its name. On 12 February 1990 it joined the Association of Free Democrats, which finally merged into the Free Democratic Party (FDP) on 11 August 1990.

==Foreign contacts==

The LDPD had contacts with other (nominally) liberal parties in the Communist bloc: Polish Democratic Party (Stronnictwo Demokratyczne, SD), the Czechoslovak Socialist Party (Československá strana socialistická, CSS), the Democratic Party of Vietnam and the Korean Democratic Party (Chõson Sahoeminjudang, CS). The Liberal Democratic Party of GDR also had some contacts with the West German FDP; in the 1960s and 1970s, there was limited communication, but relations improved in the 1980s.

<text>220 (two hundred [and] twenty) is the natural number following 219 and preceding 221.

==In mathematics==
It is a composite number, with its proper divisors being 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, making it an amicable number with 284. Every number up to 220 may be expressed as a sum of its divisors, making 220 a practical number.

It is the sum of four consecutive primes (47 + 53 + 59 + 61). It is the smallest even number with the property that when represented as a sum of two prime numbers (per Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture) both of the primes must be greater than or equal to 23.
There are exactly 220 different ways of partitioning 64 = 82 into a sum of square numbers.

It is a tetrahedral number, the sum of the first ten triangular numbers, and a dodecahedral number. If all of the diagonals of a regular decagon are drawn, the resulting figure will have exactly 220 regions.

It is the sum of the sums of the divisors of the first 16 positive integers.

<doc id="431841" wikidata="Q694238" url="?curid=431841" title="Free German Trade Union Federation">
<text>The Free German Trade Union Federation ( or &quot;FDGB&quot;) was the sole national trade union centre of the German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany) which existed from 1946 to 1990. As a mass organisation of the GDR, nominally representing all workers, the FDGB was a constituent member of the National Front. The leaders of the FDGB were also senior members of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED).

== Structure ==

The bureaucratic union apparatus was a basic component and tool of the SED’s power structure, constructed on the same strictly centralist hierarchical model as all other major GDR organizations.

The smallest unit was a , which nearly all workers in any organisation belonged to, including state leaders and party functionaries. They recommended trustworthy people as the lowest FDGB functionaries and voted for them in open-list ballots. The higher positions ranged from &quot;Departmental Union Leader&quot; (, AGL) to Leader of the &quot;Central BGL&quot; ( - Company Union Leadership in combines); they were normally full-time and held by SED members with a history of toeing the party line, or in some cases bloc party members. Their jobs, like those of the FDGB district leaders, were assured until they retired as long as they did not stray from party policy.

The chairman of the FDGB was Herbert Warnke until his death on March 26, 1975, when he was replaced by Harry Tisch, a member of the SED’s Politburo, who kept the post until the political turnaround in 1989.
== Membership ==
=== Chairmen ===

Officially, membership in the FDGB was voluntary, but unofficially it was hardly possible to develop a career without joining. In 1986, 98% of all workers and employees were organized in the FDGB, which had 9.6 million members. This meant that it was nominally one of the world&#x27;s largest trade unions. As well as improving members’ career chances, the FDGB also offered various &quot;concessions&quot;.

== Function ==
In the East German system, the FDGB was in charge of ideological control and the conformity of companies.

Though formalized, the union held responsibility for setting work norms, through negotiating with management, protecting workers from management caprice, and enforcing GDR labor code and worker protections. The union was criticised for holding too much power and making the process of firing a worker lengthy and difficult.

The FDGB was also responsible for social tasks for its members, which included hospital visits, presenting awards, giving gifts on special anniversaries, even organizing health spas and the hard-to-get holiday bookings through its own holiday service.

The single trade union was also involved in recruiting members for military functions. Incentivizing recruitment with small benefits and occasional pressure, large numbers of workers and employees were recruited to the paramilitary organization Combat Groups of the Working Class.

== School ==
In spring 1946, the former ADGB Trade Union School in Bernau bei Berlin, which before Nazi rule had belonged to the (Federation of German Trade Unions), was given to the FDGB to use as a training centre. After some restoration work, the school opened in 1947 under the name (Theodor Leipart FDGB Trade Union School). In January 1952 it was given degree awarding status and renamed (Fritz Heckert Trade Union College). In the early 1950s the FDGB considerably increased the size of the school, constructing new buildings on the site, in addition to those of the former ADGB school. The original part of the school, completed in 1930, was a project of the Bauhaus design school and in 2017 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau.

Short term two and four week training courses and longer-term study were offered, including collective bargaining, social and economic policy, youth and women&#x27;s issues, employment law, business administration, history of the labour movement, etc. After 1952 two year courses, and later, from 1956, three year bachelor&#x27;s degree-equivalent courses were also taught. From 1958 correspondence courses were also offered, and from 1959 courses were run for foreign trade unionists. Over 15,000 East German and 5,000 foreign trade unionists were trained by the FDGB school between 1947 and 1990.

The college closed in September 1990 just before German reunification.

The buildings have been used by the (Berlin Chamber of Skilled Crafts training school) since 2007.

== German reunification ==
In May 1990, shortly before German reunification, the FDGB was dissolved. Many former members did not join the West German (now German) unions, some, due to the lightning privatization of the GDR, simply because they had lost their jobs.

== Affiliates ==
The following unions were affiliated to the FDGB:

<text>Stippling is the creation of a pattern simulating varying degrees of solidity or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists.

==Art==


In printmaking, stipple engraving is a technique using flicks of the burin to build up the image in short lines or dots, often combined with conventional linear engraving. In engraved glass a similar stipple technique has often been popular.

In a drawing or painting, the dots are made of pigment of a single colour, applied with a pen or brush; the denser the dots, the darker the apparent shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface. This is similar to—but distinct from—pointillism, which uses dots of different colours to simulate blended colours.

==Botany==

In description of flora species, a stippling is a kind of pattern, especially in the case of flowering plants, produced in nature that occur on flower petals and sepals. These are similar to the dot patterns in artworks that produce an often intricate pattern. An example can be seen on the base of the petal insides of &quot;Calochortus luteus&quot;, a lily endemic to California.

==Other uses==
In forensic science, stippling refers to a pattern of gunshot residue burned into the skin that results from close proximity to a discharged firearm.

In gunsmithing, stippling is used to engrave patterns on the firearm&#x27;s grip to provide a more solid grip by creating more friction. This modification is done only on pistols with polymer frames since they have one-piece frames and solid grips, while steel-framed pistols usually have a hollow grip with textured grip scales to provide friction. If the user is willing to take the possibility of failing the procedure and getting permanent, unwanted results they can stipple their own pistols since the procedure only requires either a soldering iron or a small, handheld rotary tool with burr bits.

<text>Suave is a brand name based in Chicago, Illinois, used by the Unilever company in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. Targeting discount stores, the brand represents more than 100 products including shampoo, lotions, soaps and deodorant.

On May 9, 2023, the brand&#x27;s North American rights were acquired by Yellow Wood Partners LLC and became controlled through a new entity, Suave Brands Company (SBC). Unilever still holds rights to the brand internationally.

== History ==
Suave is a company that was started by National Mineral Company in the United States in 1937 as a hair tonic. The brand was later acquired by Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. which, in the 1970s, started expanding the Suave name beyond hair care into other areas. The brand targeted discount stores and grew its offerings to more than 100 products including shampoo, lotions, soaps and deodorant.

In 1996, Helene Curtis—and thus, Suave—was acquired by Unilever. Currently based in Chicago, the brand name is currently being used in the countries of the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Canada.

<doc id="431848" wikidata="Q2287715" url="?curid=431848" title="Covariant derivative">
<text>In mathematics, the covariant derivative is a way of specifying a derivative along tangent vectors of a manifold. Alternatively, the covariant derivative is a way of introducing and working with a connection on a manifold by means of a differential operator, to be contrasted with the approach given by a principal connection on the frame bundle – see affine connection. In the special case of a manifold isometrically embedded into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space, the covariant derivative can be viewed as the orthogonal projection of the Euclidean directional derivative onto the manifold&#x27;s tangent space. In this case the Euclidean derivative is broken into two parts, the extrinsic normal component (dependent on the embedding) and the intrinsic covariant derivative component.

The name is motivated by the importance of changes of coordinate in physics: the covariant derivative transforms covariantly under a general coordinate transformation, that is, linearly via the Jacobian matrix of the transformation.

This article presents an introduction to the covariant derivative of a vector field with respect to a vector field, both in a coordinate-free language and using a local coordinate system and the traditional index notation. The covariant derivative of a tensor field is presented as an extension of the same concept. The covariant derivative generalizes straightforwardly to a notion of differentiation associated to a connection on a vector bundle, also known as a Koszul connection.

==History==
Historically, at the turn of the 20th century, the covariant derivative was introduced by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita in the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Ricci and Levi-Civita (following ideas of Elwin Bruno Christoffel) observed that the Christoffel symbols used to define the curvature could also provide a notion of differentiation which generalized the classical directional derivative of vector fields on a manifold. This new derivative – the Levi-Civita connection – was &quot;covariant&quot; in the sense that it satisfied Riemann&#x27;s requirement that objects in geometry should be independent of their description in a particular coordinate system.

It was soon noted by other mathematicians, prominent among these being Hermann Weyl, Jan Arnoldus Schouten, and Élie Cartan, that a covariant derivative could be defined abstractly without the presence of a metric. The crucial feature was not a particular dependence on the metric, but that the Christoffel symbols satisfied a certain precise second-order transformation law. This transformation law could serve as a starting point for defining the derivative in a covariant manner. Thus the theory of covariant differentiation forked off from the strictly Riemannian context to include a wider range of possible geometries.

In the 1940s, practitioners of differential geometry began introducing other notions of covariant differentiation in general vector bundles which were, in contrast to the classical bundles of interest to geometers, not part of the tensor analysis of the manifold. By and large, these generalized covariant derivatives had to be specified &quot;ad hoc&quot; by some version of the connection concept. In 1950, Jean-Louis Koszul unified these new ideas of covariant differentiation in a vector bundle by means of what is known today as a Koszul connection or a connection on a vector bundle. Using ideas from Lie algebra cohomology, Koszul successfully converted many of the analytic features of covariant differentiation into algebraic ones. In particular, Koszul connections eliminated the need for awkward manipulations of Christoffel symbols (and other analogous non-tensorial objects) in differential geometry. Thus they quickly supplanted the classical notion of covariant derivative in many post-1950 treatments of the subject.

==Motivation==

The covariant derivative is a generalization of the directional derivative from vector calculus. As with the directional derivative, the covariant derivative is a rule, formula_1, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector, , defined at a point , and (2) a vector field defined in a neighborhood of . The output is the vector formula_2, also at the point . The primary difference from the usual directional derivative is that formula_1 must, in a certain precise sense, be &quot;independent&quot; of the manner in which it is expressed in a coordinate system.

A vector may be &quot;described&quot; as a list of numbers in terms of a basis, but as a geometrical object the vector retains its identity regardless of how it is described. For a geometric vector written in components with respect to one basis, when the basis is changed the components transform according to a change of basis formula, with the coordinates undergoing a covariant transformation. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, by a covariant transformation in the same way as a basis does (hence the name).

In the case of Euclidean space, one usually defines the directional derivative of a vector field in terms of the difference between two vectors at two nearby points.
In such a system one translates one of the vectors to the origin of the other, keeping it parallel, then takes their difference within the same vector space. With a Cartesian (fixed orthonormal) coordinate system &quot;keeping it parallel&quot; amounts to keeping the components constant. This ordinary directional derivative on Euclidean space is the first example of a covariant derivative.

Next, one must take into account changes of the coordinate system. For example, if the Euclidean plane is described by polar coordinates, &quot;keeping it parallel&quot; does &quot;not&quot; amount to keeping the polar components constant under translation, since the coordinate grid itself &quot;rotates&quot;. Thus, the same covariant derivative written in polar coordinates contains extra terms that describe how the coordinate grid itself rotates, or how in more general coordinates the grid expands, contracts, twists, interweaves, etc. 

Consider the example of a particle moving along a curve in the Euclidean plane. In polar coordinates, may be written in terms of its radial and angular coordinates by . A vector at a particular time (for instance, a constant acceleration of the particle) is expressed in terms of formula_4, where formula_5 and formula_6 are unit tangent vectors for the polar coordinates, serving as a basis to decompose a vector in terms of radial and tangential components. At a slightly later time, the new basis in polar coordinates appears slightly rotated with respect to the first set. The covariant derivative of the basis vectors (the Christoffel symbols) serve to express this change.
In a curved space, such as the surface of the Earth (regarded as a sphere), the translation of tangent vectors between different points is not well defined, and its analog, parallel transport, depends on the path along which the vector is translated. A vector on a globe on the equator at point Q is directed to the north. Suppose we transport the vector (keeping it parallel) first along the equator to the point P, then drag it along a meridian to the N pole, and finally transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then we notice that the parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and is caused by the &quot;curvature&quot; of the surface of the globe. The same effect occurs if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. This infinitesimal change of the vector is a measure of the curvature, and can be defined in terms of the covariant derivative.

===Remarks===
* The definition of the covariant derivative does not use the metric in space. However, for each metric there is a unique torsion-free covariant derivative called the Levi-Civita connection such that the covariant derivative of the metric is zero.
* The properties of a derivative imply that formula_7 depends on the values of on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a point in the same way as e.g. the derivative of a scalar function along a curve at a given point depends on the values of in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of .
* The information on the neighborhood of a point in the covariant derivative can be used to define parallel transport of a vector. Also the curvature, torsion, and geodesics may be defined only in terms of the covariant derivative or other related variation on the idea of a linear connection.

==Informal definition using an embedding into Euclidean space==
Suppose an open subset formula_8 of a formula_9-dimensional Riemannian manifold formula_10 is embedded into Euclidean space formula_11 via a twice continuously-differentiable (C) mapping formula_12 such that the tangent space at formula_13 is spanned by the vectors
formula_14
and the scalar product formula_15 on formula_16 is compatible with the metric on :
formula_17

(Since the manifold metric is always assumed to be regular, the compatibility condition implies linear independence of the partial derivative tangent vectors.)

For a tangent vector field, one has
formula_18

The last term is not tangential to , but can be expressed as a linear combination of the tangent space base vectors using the Christoffel symbols as linear factors plus a vector orthogonal to the tangent space:
formula_19

In the case of the Levi-Civita connection, the covariant derivative formula_20, also written is defined as the orthogonal projection of the usual derivative onto tangent space:
formula_21

From here it may be computationally convenient to obtain a relation between the Christoffel symbols for the Levi-Civita connection and the metric. To do this we first note that, since the vector formula_22 in the previous equation is orthogonal to the tangent space,
formula_23

Then, since the partial derivative of a component formula_24 of the metric with respect to a coordinate formula_25 is
formula_26

any triplet of indices yields a system of equations
formula_27
(Here the symmetry of the scalar product has been used and the order of partial differentiations have been swapped.)

Adding the first two equations and subtracting the third, we obtain
formula_28

Thus the Christoffel symbols for the Levi-Civita connection are related to the metric by
formula_29

If formula_30 is nondegenerate then formula_31 can be solved for directly as

formula_32

For a very simple example that captures the essence of the description above, draw a circle on a flat sheet of paper. Travel around the circle at a constant speed. The derivative of your velocity, your acceleration vector, always points radially inward. Roll this sheet of paper into a cylinder. Now the (Euclidean) derivative of your velocity has a component that sometimes points inward toward the axis of the cylinder depending on whether you&#x27;re near a solstice or an equinox. (At the point of the circle when you are moving parallel to the axis, there is no inward acceleration. Conversely, at a point (1/4 of a circle later) when the velocity is along the cylinder&#x27;s bend, the inward acceleration is maximum.) This is the (Euclidean) normal component. The covariant derivative component is the component parallel to the cylinder&#x27;s surface, and is the same as that before you rolled the sheet into a cylinder.

==Formal definition==
A covariant derivative is a (Koszul) connection on the tangent bundle and other tensor bundles: it differentiates vector fields in a way analogous to the usual differential on functions. The definition extends to a differentiation on the dual of vector fields (i.e. covector fields) and to arbitrary tensor fields, in a unique way that ensures compatibility with the tensor product and trace operations (tensor contraction).

===Functions===
Given a point formula_33 of the manifold formula_10, a real function formula_35 on the manifold and a tangent vector formula_36, the covariant derivative of at along is the scalar at , denoted formula_37, that represents the principal part of the change in the value of when the argument of is changed by the infinitesimal displacement vector . (This is the differential of evaluated against the vector .) Formally, there is a differentiable curve formula_38 such that formula_39 and formula_40, and the covariant derivative of at is defined by
formula_41

When formula_42 is a vector field on formula_10, the covariant derivative formula_44 is the function that associates with each point in the common domain of and the scalar formula_45. 

For a scalar function and vector field , the covariant derivative formula_46 coincides with the Lie derivative formula_47, and with the exterior derivative formula_48.

===Vector fields===
Given a point formula_49 of the manifold formula_10, a vector field formula_51 defined in a neighborhood of and a tangent vector formula_36, the covariant derivative of at along is the tangent vector at , denoted formula_53, such that the following properties hold (for any tangent vectors , and at , vector fields and defined in a neighborhood of , scalar values and at , and scalar function defined in a neighborhood of ):
# formula_54 is linear in formula_55 so formula_56
# formula_54 is additive in formula_58 so: formula_59
# formula_53 obeys the product rule; i.e., where formula_61 is defined above, formula_62

Note that formula_54 depends not only on the value of at but also on values of in an infinitesimal neighborhood of because of the last property, the product rule.

If and are both vector fields defined over a common domain, then formula_64 denotes the vector field whose value at each point of the domain is the tangent vector formula_65.

===Covector fields===
Given a field of covectors (or one-form) formula_66 defined in a neighborhood of , its covariant derivative formula_67 is defined in a way to make the resulting operation compatible with tensor contraction and the product rule. That is, formula_67 is defined as the unique one-form at such that the following identity is satisfied for all vector fields in a neighborhood of 
formula_69

The covariant derivative of a covector field along a vector field is again a covector field.

===Tensor fields===
Once the covariant derivative is defined for fields of vectors and covectors it can be defined for arbitrary tensor fields by imposing the following identities for every pair of tensor fields formula_70 and formula_71 in a neighborhood of the point :
formula_72
and for formula_73 and formula_74 of the same valence
formula_75
The covariant derivative of a tensor field along a vector field is again a tensor field of the same type.

Explicitly, let be a tensor field of type . Consider to be a differentiable multilinear map of smooth sections of the cotangent bundle and of sections of the tangent bundle , written into . The covariant derivative of along is given by the formula

formula_76

==Coordinate description==

Given coordinate functions formula_77 any tangent vector can be described by its components in the basis formula_78

The covariant derivative of a basis vector along a basis vector is again a vector and so can be expressed as a linear combination formula_79.
To specify the covariant derivative it is enough to specify the covariant derivative of each basis vector field formula_80 along formula_81.
formula_82

the coefficients formula_83 are the components of the connection with respect to a system of local coordinates. In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, the components of the Levi-Civita connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called Christoffel symbols.

Then using the rules in the definition, we find that for general vector fields formula_84 and formula_85 we get
formula_86

so
formula_87

The first term in this formula is responsible for &quot;twisting&quot; the coordinate system with respect to the covariant derivative and the second for changes of components of the vector field . In particular
formula_88

In words: the covariant derivative is the usual derivative along the coordinates with correction terms which tell how the coordinates change.

For covectors similarly we have
formula_89

where formula_90.

The covariant derivative of a type tensor field along formula_91 is given by the expression:

formula_92

Or, in words: take the partial derivative of the tensor and add: formula_93 for every upper index formula_94, and formula_95 for every lower index formula_96.

If instead of a tensor, one is trying to differentiate a &quot;tensor density&quot; (of weight +1), then one also adds a term
formula_97
If it is a tensor density of weight , then multiply that term by .
For example, formula_98 is a scalar density (of weight +1), so we get:
formula_99

where semicolon &quot;;&quot; indicates covariant differentiation and comma &quot;,&quot; indicates partial differentiation. Incidentally, this particular expression is equal to zero, because the covariant derivative of a function solely of the metric is always zero.

== Notation ==
In textbooks on physics, the covariant derivative is sometimes simply stated in terms of its components in this equation.

Often a notation is used in which the covariant derivative is given with a semicolon, while a normal partial derivative is indicated by a comma. In this notation we write the same as:
formula_100
In case two or more indexes appear after the semicolon, all of them must be understood as covariant derivatives:
formula_101

In some older texts (notably Adler, Bazin &amp; Schiffer, &quot;Introduction to General Relativity&quot;), the covariant derivative is denoted by a double pipe and the partial derivative by single pipe:
formula_102

==Covariant derivative by field type==
For a scalar field formula_103, covariant differentiation is simply partial differentiation:
formula_104

For a contravariant vector field formula_105, we have:
formula_106

For a covariant vector field formula_107, we have:
formula_108

For a type (2,0) tensor field formula_109, we have:
formula_110

For a type (0,2) tensor field formula_111, we have:
formula_112

For a type (1,1) tensor field formula_113, we have:
formula_114

The notation above is meant in the sense
formula_115

== Properties ==
In general, covariant derivatives do not commute. By example, the covariant derivatives of vector field formula_116. The Riemann tensor formula_117 is defined such that:
formula_118

or, equivalently,
formula_119

The covariant derivative of a (2,0)-tensor field fulfills: 
formula_120

The latter can be shown by taking (without loss of generality) that formula_121.

==Derivative along a curve==
Since the covariant derivative formula_122 of a tensor field formula_123 at a point formula_49 depends only on the value of the vector field formula_125 at formula_49 one can define the covariant derivative along a smooth curve formula_127 in a manifold:
formula_128
Note that the tensor field formula_123 only needs to be defined on the curve formula_127 for this definition to make sense.

In particular, formula_131 is a vector field along the curve formula_132 itself. If formula_133 vanishes then the curve is called a geodesic of the covariant derivative. If the covariant derivative is the Levi-Civita connection of a positive-definite metric then the geodesics for the connection are precisely the geodesics of the metric that are parametrized by arc length.

The derivative along a curve is also used to define the parallel transport along the curve.

Sometimes the covariant derivative along a curve is called absolute or intrinsic derivative.

==Relation to Lie derivative==
A covariant derivative introduces an extra geometric structure on a manifold that allows vectors in neighboring tangent spaces to be compared: there is no canonical way to compare vectors from different tangent spaces because there is no canonical coordinate system.

There is however another generalization of directional derivatives which &quot;is&quot; canonical: the Lie derivative, which evaluates the change of one vector field along the flow of another vector field. Thus, one must know both vector fields in an open neighborhood, not merely at a single point. The covariant derivative on the other hand introduces its own change for vectors in a given direction, and it only depends on the vector direction at a single point, rather than a vector field in an open neighborhood of a point. In other words, the covariant derivative is linear (over ) in the direction argument, while the Lie derivative is linear in neither argument.

Note that the antisymmetrized covariant derivative , and the Lie derivative differ by the torsion of the connection, so that if a connection is torsion free, then its antisymmetrization &quot;is&quot; the Lie derivative.

<text>Wheeling University (WU, formerly Wheeling Jesuit University) is a private Roman Catholic university in Wheeling, West Virginia. It was founded as &quot;Wheeling College&quot; in 1954 by the Society of Jesus (also known as the Jesuits) and was a Jesuit institution until 2019. Wheeling University competes in Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association as a member of the Mountain East Conference.

==History==
Richard Whelan, bishop of the Diocese of Wheeling, lobbied the Society of Jesus in the 19th century to establish a university in the growing city. Over a century later, Whelan&#x27;s original vision came to fruition. After a donor, Sara Tracy, left her estate to the diocese, it purchased land for a Jesuit college from Mt. De Chantal Visitation Academy.

Wheeling College was founded through a partnership of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston with the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus. Ground was broken on November 24, 1953, and the college was officially incorporated on September 25, 1954. It opened to students on September 26, 1955. The establishment of the college required $2.75 million in start-up costs. Overcoming the difficulties of temporary facilities and a faculty of twelve Jesuit priests and four lay professors, the school grew considerably.

For the 1987–1988 school year, the university became Wheeling Jesuit College, and in July 1996, gained university status.

In 2012, university leadership was accused by the federal government of misappropriating NASA grant money received for sponsored programs. Wheeling Jesuit settled with the federal government in 2015, paying $2.3 million in restitution.

In March 2013, the university announced the selection of Fr. James Fleming as its tenth president. Fleming took office effective July 1, 2013. Fleming resigned from the presidency on January 3, 2017.

In 2019, the school eliminated majors in history, theology, philosophy, literature, and engineering and cut 20 of the university&#x27;s full-time faculty members.

===Jesuit heritage===
Prior to 2019, the Jesuit community was active in the process of education at Wheeling. In addition, the Jesuits were involved in many other academic works, such as the Appalachian Institute on campus. Members of Wheeling&#x27;s Jesuit Community reside at Whelan Hall, dedicated in 1955. The Jesuit community and tradition for critical thinking were reflected in the school&#x27;s curriculum and mission. Wheeling Jesuit University was a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.

In April 2019, as part of a broader restructuring of its academic programs, the university announced the elimination of its programs in theology and philosophy that are key to its identity as a Jesuit institution. The Jesuits in turn decided to end their academic affiliation with the university at the end of the 2018–2019 academic year, while continuing to provide &quot;an ongoing Jesuit presence&quot; through its campus ministry and other programs. Two months later, Monsignor Kevin Quirk resigned from his position as chair of the university&#x27;s board of trustees after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published details from a confidential report alleging that one of his former colleagues was guilty of sexual abuse and financial impropriety. In July, the university formally dropped &quot;Jesuit&quot; from its name and became Wheeling University.

In 1997, WJU was named as the fourth-best educational value in the southeast, and the 15th-best college in the region. In addition, the school is ranked as the 18th best master&#x27;s university in the South by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The 2009 &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranking placed WJU as 180 of 600 colleges, a marked improvement from their No. 437 rank in 2008. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the university as the 79th best value in America. The university is ranked among the John Templeton Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Colleges that Encourage Character Development&quot;.

==Academics==

In honor of former professor Fr. Stephen J. Laut, S.J., the university offers the Laut Honors Program. Throughout each school year, members of the program meet to discuss and study material related to that year&#x27;s theme. At the conclusion of a student&#x27;s sophomore year, students who have successfully completed the Laut program are invited to join the Ignatian Honors Seminar, a more rigorous program for which only six juniors and six seniors are selected.

Wheeling encourages all students to become actively involved in research in their desired fields. In many fields, seniors are required to complete a thesis or capstone project. In addition, students are actively encouraged to participate in the annual Student Research and Scholarship Symposium, in which students present research done over the past academic year.

===Graduate programs===
Wheeling University&#x27;s Center for Professional and Graduate Studies offers five graduate programs, a Master of Business Administration; a Master of Accountancy; a Master of Science in Nursing; a Master of Science in Organizational Leadership; and a Doctor of Physical Therapy.

The Center for Professional and Graduate Studies offers a Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Leadership and Development (BOLD) and a Master of Science in Organizational Leadership (MSOL). These are adult education programs that meet once a week in the evening.
===Clifford M. Lewis, S.J. Appalachian Institute===
Founded in September 2002, The Appalachian Institute is a pastoral and academic response of Wheeling University to the Appalachian bishops’ pastoral letters, &quot;This Land is Home to Me&quot; (1975 - on power and powerlessness in Appalachia) and &quot;At Home in the Web of Life&quot; (1995 - on sustainability). Focused on advocacy, culture, education, research and service through the mode of immersion, as matters of social justice, the Appalachian Institute grounds its mission as a responsible and sustainable partner for the university and the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston invigorating the Catholic social mission as an available instrument of Catholic social teaching, and as a positive force for growing sustainable relationships with community partners locally, nationwide &amp; internationally. The Appalachian Institute at Wheeling University has focused on issues such as Appalachian health, hope, education, economic and energy development, and issues related to coal impoundment, conducting research and producing exhibits regarding these issues.

In 2010, the university hosted the Ignatian Solidarity Network Spring Teach-In, which focused on issues of environmental sustainability and stewardship. In September 2010, the Appalachian Institute held its second annual Appalachian Film Festival.

===Institute for the Study of Capitalism and Morality===
As a result of a donation from BB&amp;T, in 2006 the university became home to the Institute for the Study of Capitalism and Morality. According to its website, the Institute desires to study the roles of capitalism in a free society. The institute also promotes research and essay competitions, forums and debates, and a lecture series. Lecturers for the 2007–2008 school year included Thomas Woods and Doug Bandow. In 2011, the ISCM welcomed former BB&amp;T CEO John A. Allison IV to campus.

===Academic facilities===

===Acker Science Center===
Named for the school&#x27;s former president Rev. Fr. Thomas S. Acker, S.J., the Acker Science Center was built in 2002. It is home to classrooms and labs.

==Mount de Chantal Conservatory of Music==
The adjacent former girls&#x27; academy, Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy ceased operations in August 2010 and the Sisters of the Visitation, who ran the school since its inception, moved to the monastery at Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington, D.C. Wishing to see the Mount&#x27;s legacy continued, the sisters gifted a large sum of money to establish and fund a Conservatory of Music at the university.

Thus the Mount de Chantal Conservatory of Music came to be in the lower floor of the university&#x27;s CET building. The Conservatory features a recital hall, practice rooms, a parlor for students and visitors, and a gallery displaying art, antiques and archival materials from Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy. Each year, one incoming female freshman receives a $10,000 Mount de Chantal Scholarship, renewable annually, through the Mount de Chantal Fine Arts Education Fund.

In 2024, the Wheeling men&#x27;s rugby team completed an unbeaten season in 7s rugby and was named National Champions in the Premier Division at the Collegiate Rugby Championship 7s Tournament in Boyds, Maryland. 

===Facilities===
The university&#x27;s home indoor athletic events for volleyball and basketball are held in WU&#x27;s McDonough Center.

<text>The Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) was a professional organization which existed from 1912 until December 31, 1962. On January 1, 1963, it merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

==Founding==

Following several attempts to form a technical organization of wireless practitioners in 1908–1912, the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) was finally established in 1912 in New York City. Among its founding organizations were the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers (SWTE) and the Wireless Institute (TWI). At the time, the dominant organization of electrical engineers was the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). Many of the founding members of IRE considered AIEE too conservative and too focused on electric power. Moreover, the founders of the IRE sought to establish an international organization (unlike the “American” AIEE), and adopted a tradition of electing some of the IRE&#x27;s officers from outside the United States.

In the first half of the 20th century, radio communications had experienced great expansion, and the growing professional community of developers and operators of radio systems required standardization, research, and authoritative dissemination of new results among practitioners and researchers. To meet these needs, the IRE established professional journals (most notably the &quot;Proceedings of the IRE&quot;, established 1913 and edited for 41 years by Alfred N. Goldsmith); participated actively in all aspects of standardization and regulations of the frequency spectrum, modulation techniques, testing methods, and radio equipment; and organized regional and professional groups (starting in 1914 and 1948, respectively) for cooperation and exchange between members. The IRE was a major participant in planning of the Federal Radio Commission (established 1927; later the Federal Communications Commission), and worked in close cooperation with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Radio Manufacturers Association, the Radio and Television Manufacturers Association, and the National Television System Committee on Standards. The IRE also started (in 1914) a program of professional recognition, through the membership grade of IRE Fellow. The first Fellow was Jonathan Zenneck (1871–1959), a pioneer of wireless telegraphy.

==Merger==
Until the early 1940s IRE was a relatively small engineering organization, but the growing importance of electronic communications and the emergence of the discipline of electronics in the 1940s have increased its appeal to practitioners. Students of electrical engineering and young electrical engineers favored IRE over its older rival, the AIEE, and in 1957 IRE (with 57,000 members) was the larger organization. Negotiations about merging the two organizations started that year and continued until a new joint organization, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) was established in 1963. Several new professional organizations (such as the Society of Broadcast Engineers), were founded shortly thereafter by IRE and AIEE members who opposed the merger.

The first president of IRE was Robert H. Marriott, chief engineer of the Wireless Company of America. Other notable presidents of the IRE included Irving Langmuir (1923), John H. Morecroft (1924), Lee deForest (1930), Louis A. Hazeltine (1936), Frederick E. Terman (1941), Arthur F. Van Dyck (1942), William R. Hewlett (1954), Ernst Weber (1959; also first president of IEEE, 1963) and Patrick E. Haggerty (1962).

==Medal of Honor==
The IRE issued the IRE Medal of Honor each year which is now the IEEE Medal of Honor.

<text>John Ned Shines (April 26, 1915 – April 20, 1992) was an American blues singer and guitarist.

==Biography==
Shines was born in Frayser, Tennessee, today a neighborhood of Memphis. He was taught to play the guitar by his mother and spent most of his childhood in Memphis, playing slide guitar at an early age in juke joints and on the street. He moved to Hughes, Arkansas, in 1932 and worked on farms for three years, putting aside his music career. A chance meeting with Robert Johnson, his greatest influence, gave him the inspiration to return to music. In 1935, Shines began traveling with Johnson, touring in the United States and Canada. They parted in 1937, one year before Johnson&#x27;s death.

Shines played throughout the southern United States until 1941, when he settled in Chicago. There he found work in the construction industry but continued to play in local bars.

He made his first recording in 1946 for Columbia Records, but the takes were never released. He recorded for Chess Records in 1950, but again no records were released. He kept playing with blues musicians in the Chicago area for several more years. In 1952, Shines recorded what is considered his best work, for J.O.B. Records. The recordings were a commercial failure, and Shines, frustrated with the music industry, sold his equipment and returned to working in construction.

In 1966, Vanguard Records found Shines taking photographs in a Chicago blues club, and he recorded tracks for the third volume of &quot;Chicago/The Blues/Today!&quot;. The album became a blues classic, and it brought Shines into the mainstream music scene. Shines toured with the Chicago All Stars alongside Lee Jackson, Big Walter Horton and Willie Dixon.

Shines moved to Holt, Alabama, in Tuscaloosa County, in 1969. Natalie Mattson, a student at the University of Alabama, learned that he was living in the area and invited him to play at a campus coffee house, the Down Under, which she ran. Shines played there on several occasions and brought his friend, blues artist Mississippi Fred McDowell, to perform with him. These were some of his earliest appearances in Alabama after his move there. He continued to play the international blues circuit while living in Holt.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, Shines toured with Robert Lockwood, Jr., Robert Johnson&#x27;s stepson, another one of the last living original Delta blues musicians. In 1980, Shines&#x27;s career was brought to a standstill when he suffered a stroke. He later appeared and played in the 1991 documentary &quot;The Search for Robert Johnson&quot;. His final album, &quot;Back to the Country&quot;, with accompaniment by Snooky Pryor and Johnny Nicholas, won a W. C. Handy Award.

In 1989, Shines met Kent DuChaine, and the two of them toured for the next several years, until Shines&#x27;s death.

Shines died on April 20, 1992, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame later the same year.

According to the music journalist Tony Russell,

Shines was that rare being, a blues artist who overcame age and rustiness to make music that stood up beside the work of his youth. When Shines came back to the blues in 1965 he was 50, yet his voice had the leonine power of a dozen years before, when he made records his reputation was based on.

<text>Allameh Ali-Akbar Dehkhodā (; 1879 – March 9, 1956) was a prominent Iranian literary writer, philologist, and lexicographer. 

He was the author of the &quot;Dehkhoda Dictionary&quot;, the most extensive dictionary of the Persian language published to date.

==Biography==
Dehkhoda was born in Tehran to parents from Qazvin. His father, Khan-Baba Khan Ghazvini, died when he was only 9 years old. 

Dehkhoda excelled quickly in Persian literature, Arabic, and French. He enrolled at the School of Political Science, which employed, amongst other figures, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and his Secretary as lecturers.

He was also active in politics, and served in the Majles as a Member of Parliament from Kerman and Tehran. He also served as Dean of Tehran School of Political Science and later the School of Law of the University of Tehran.

In 1903, he went to the Balkans as an Iranian embassy employee, but came back to Iran two years later and became involved in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran.

Dehkhoda, Mirza Jahangir Khan and Ghasem Khan published the &quot;Sur-e Esrafil&quot; newspaper for about two years, until Mohammad Ali Shah disbanded the parliament and banished Dehkhoda and some other liberals into exile in Europe. There he continued publishing articles and editorials, but when Mohammad Ali Shah was deposed in 1911, he returned to the country and became a member of the new Majlis.

He is buried in Ebn-e Babooyeh cemetery in Shahr-e Ray, near Tehran.

In his article &quot;First Iranian Scholar who authored the Most Extensive &amp; Comprehensive Farsi Dictionary,&quot; Manouchehr Saadat Noury wrote that,

==Works==

Dehkhoda translated Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;De l&#x27;esprit des lois&quot; (&quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;) into Persian. 

He has also written &quot;Amsal o Hekam&quot; (&quot;Proverbs and Sayings&quot;) in four volumes, a French-Persian Dictionary, and other books.

His lexicographic masterpiece is &quot;Loghat-nameh-ye Dehkhoda&quot; (&quot;Dehkhoda Dictionary&quot;), the largest Persian dictionary ever published, in 15 volumes. Mohammad Moin accomplished Dehkhoda&#x27;s unfinished volumes according to Dehkhoda&#x27;s request after him. Finally the book was published after forty five years of efforts of Dehkhoda.

<text>Internet research is the practice of using data from the Internet, especially free information on the World Wide Web and Internet-based resources (like online forums and social media), in research.

Internet research has had a profound impact on the way ideas are formed and knowledge is created. Common applications of Internet research include personal research on a particular subject (something mentioned on the news, a health problem, etc.), students doing research for academic projects and papers, and journalists and other writers researching stories. Through web search, pages with some relation to a given search entry can be visited, analyzed, and compiled. In addition, the Web can be used to connect with relevant sources of primary data (e.g., experts) and conduct online interviews. Communication tools used for this purpose on the Web include email (including mailing lists), online discussion groups (including message boards and BBSes), and other personal communication facilities (instant messaging, IRC, newsgroups, etc.).

Internet research can provide quick, immediate, and worldwide access to information, although results may be affected by unrecognized bias, difficulties in verifying a writer&#x27;s credentials (and therefore the accuracy or pertinence of the information obtained), and whether the researcher has sufficient skill to draw meaningful results from the abundance of material typically available. The first resources retrieved may not be the most suitable resources to answer a particular question. Popularity is often a factor used in structuring Internet search results, but popular information is not always most correct or representative of the breadth of knowledge and opinion on a topic.

==Search tools==

Search tools for finding information on the Internet include web search engines, the search engines on individual websites, the browsers&#x27; hotkey-activated feature for searching in the current page, meta search engines, web directories, and specialty search services. 

=== Web search ===
A Web search allows a user to enter a search query, in the form of keywords or a phrase, into either a search box or on a search form, and then finds matching results and displays them on the screen. The results are accessed from a database, using search algorithms that select web pages based on the location and frequency of keywords on them, along with the quality and number of external hyperlinks pointing at them. The database is supplied with data from a web crawler that follows the hyperlinks that connect web pages, and copies their content, records their URLs, and other data about the page along the way. The content is then indexed, to aid retrieval.

To view this information, a user enters their search query, in the form of keywords or a phrase, into a search box or search form. Then, the search engine uses its algorithms to query a database, selecting 

=== Websites&#x27; search feature ===
Websites often have a search engine of their own, for searching just the site&#x27;s content, often displayed at the top of every page. For example, Wikipedia provides a search engine for exploring its content. A search engine within a website allows a user to focus on its content and find desired information with more precision than with a web search engine. It may also provide access to information on the website for which a web search engine does not.

=== Browsers&#x27; local search features ===

Browsers typically provide separate input boxes to search history titles, bookmarks, and the currently displayed web page, though the latter only shows up when a hot key is pressed. 

==== Browsers&#x27; search hot key ====

Using a key combo (two or more keys pressed down at the same time), the user can search the current page displayed by the browser. This is especially useful for long articles. A common key combo for this is .

=== Meta search engines ===

A Meta search engine enables users to enter a search query once and it runs against multiple search engines simultaneously, creating a list of aggregated search results. Since no single search engine covers the entire web, a meta search engine can produce a more comprehensive search of the web. Most meta search engines automatically eliminate duplicate search results. However, meta search engines have a significant limitation because the most popular search engines, such as Google, are not included because of legal restrictions.

=== Web directories ===

A Web directory organizes subjects in a hierarchical fashion that lets users investigate the breadth of a specific topic and drill down to find relevant links and content. Web directories can be assembled automatically by algorithms or handcrafted. Human-edited Web directories have the distinct advantage of higher quality and reliability, while those produced by algorithms can offer more comprehensive coverage. The scope of Web directories are generally broad, such as Curlie and The WWW Virtual Library, covering a wide range of subjects, while others focus on specific topics.

=== Specialty search tools ===

Specialty search tools enable users to find information that conventional search engines and meta search engines cannot access because the content is stored in databases. In fact, the vast majority of information on the web is stored in databases that require users to go to a specific site and access it through a search form. Often, the content is generated dynamically. As a consequence, Web crawlers are unable to index this information. In a sense, this content is &quot;hidden&quot; from search engines, leading to the term invisible or deep Web. Specialty search tools have evolved to provide users with the means to quickly and easily find deep Web content. These specialty tools rely on advanced bot and intelligent agent technologies to search the deep Web and automatically generate specialty Web directories, such as the Virtual Private Library.

== Website authorship ==

When using the Internet for research, a large number of websites may appear in the search results for whatever search query is entered. Each of these sites has one or more authors or associated organizations providing content, and the accuracy and reliability of the content may be extremely variable. It is necessary to identify authorship of web content so that reliability and bias can be assessed. 

The author or sponsoring organization of a website may be found in several ways. Sometimes the author or organization can be found at the bottom of the website home page. Another way is by looking in the ‘Contact Us’ section of the website. It may be directly listed, determined from the email address, or by emailing and asking. If the author&#x27;s name or sponsoring organization cannot be determined, one should question the trustworthiness of the website. If the author&#x27;s name or sponsoring organization is found, an Internet search might provide information that can be used to determine if the website is reliable and unbiased.

== Internet research software ==

Internet research software captures information while performing Internet research. This information can then be organized in various ways included tagging and hierarchical trees. The goal is to collect information relevant to a specific research project in one place, so that it can be found and accessed again quickly.

These tools also allow captured content to be edited and annotated and some allow the ability to export to other formats. Other features common to outliners include the ability to use full text search which aids in quickly locating information and filters enable you to drill down to see only information relevant to a specific query. Captured and kept information also provides an additional backup, in case web pages and sites disappear or are inaccessible later.

<text>The International Exhibition of Navigation, Commerce and Industry in Liverpool, England, was opened by Queen Victoria on 11 May 1886.

The fair was held in Antwerp&#x27;s exhibition hall which was transported for the exhibition and erected alongside Wavertree Botanic Gardens. Additional attractions were the chance to visit the , and to see a lifesize copy of the Eddystone Lighthouse and the rowing boat in which Grace Darling and her father rescued stranded occupants of a wrecked ship.

Exhibitions from parts of the British Empire outside the United Kingdom included an African village, 50 &quot;natives of Indian and Ceylon&quot;, camel and elephant rides, and a Canadian toboggan ride

It was followed in 1887 by the Royal Jubilee Exhibition also in Liverpool.

<doc id="431886" wikidata="Q3111741" url="?curid=431886" title="Mike Cameron">
<text>Michael Terrance Cameron (born January 8, 1973) is an American former professional Major League Baseball outfielder. He played for the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Seattle Mariners, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox, and Florida Marlins over a 16 year career and is currently the Special Assignment Coach for the Seattle Mariners.

In 2002, Cameron became the 13th player to hit four home runs in one game. He was also an All-Star in 2001 and won Gold Gloves in 2001, 2003, and 2006. Mike Cameron has distinguished himself by being only one of 22 players in the history of baseball to have at least 250 home runs and 250 stolen bases and became the 20th member of this exclusive 250/250 club. Cameron is also the only MLB player to hit 2 home runs in the same game with 8 separate teams.

==Early life==
Cameron was born in La Grange, Georgia, and raised on Render Street by his grandmother; he moved into her house when he was seven years old to keep her company after her husband died. Cameron attended LaGrange High School. His grandmother kept him from playing baseball as a high school junior because he failed a chemistry class. As a result, he drew less attention from scouts.

==Playing career==
===Chicago White Sox===
Cameron was drafted out of high school in the 18th round by the Chicago White Sox in 1991. His major league debut took place on August 27, , with the Chicago White Sox. In he won a starting job as the team&#x27;s regular center fielder.

===Cincinnati Reds===
He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Paul Konerko in .

===Seattle Mariners===
Along with three other players he was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Ken Griffey Jr. before the season.

Cameron tied a major league record on May 2, 2002, when he hit four home runs in one game becoming only the 13th player in MLB history to do this. In his fifth at bat, he hit one to the warning track, just missing what would have been a record-setting fifth home run.
He played in the All-Star Game in , reached the postseason twice and won the Gold Glove Award in 2001 and 2003 for his defensive play in the outfield. He led all major league center fielders in range factor (3.42) in 2003.

===New York Mets===
On December 23, 2003, Cameron signed a three-year, $19.5 million contract to play center field for the New York Mets. In his first season with the Mets, Cameron hit a career-high 30 home runs. With the acquisition by the Mets of Carlos Beltrán before the 2005 season, Cameron surrendered his position to the star center fielder and played most of his games in right field during the 2005 season.

On August 11, 2005, in San Diego, Cameron collided with Beltran in the outfield as both made diving attempts to catch a fly ball. Cameron suffered a concussion and multiple fractures of his nose and cheekbones, and was removed from the field on a stretcher. Beltran also suffered a concussion but was able to walk off the field with help.

===San Diego Padres===

On November 15, , Cameron was traded to the San Diego Padres for Xavier Nady. He won his first National League Gold Glove award during the season with San Diego.

After leaving the Seattle Mariners in 2004 via free agency, Cameron played his first game back in Seattle during inter-league play in May 2006. Mariners fans greeted his return with a standing ovation.

On October 31, 2007, it was announced that he had failed a test for banned stimulants for a second time and would miss the first 25 games of the 2008 season. Cameron has said he believes that a supplement he took was &quot;tainted.&quot; However, given the requirement of two failed drug tests before an announcement is made, this explanation is questionable. He was just the second major leaguer to be suspended for a second positive test for stimulants, following Neifi Pérez.

===Milwaukee Brewers===

On January 14, he signed a 1-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.

On March 13, 2008, Cameron applied for a therapeutic exemption to use stimulants during the 2008 season because of his outfield collision with former teammate Carlos Beltrán. He claimed to be struggling with after-effects of the collision that ended his 2005 season. If he had applied for the exemption in 2007, he could have avoided the 25-game suspension he had to serve to begin this season for testing positive for a banned stimulant for the second time. He also told USA Today that he would see a neurologist to determine if he was suffering from post-concussion syndrome. If the exemption were granted, Cameron would have been permitted to use some amphetamines that are banned by the Major League Baseball drug policy.

In November 2008, his club option was picked up by the Brewers for the 2009 season.

On May 24, 2009, Cameron hit his 250th career home run against the Minnesota Twins, becoming the 20th player in the league to hit 250 home runs and steal 250 bases.

===Boston Red Sox===
On December 16, 2009, Cameron signed a 2-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. He missed most of the season with a groin injury but managed to still hit 4 home runs on the season.

Cameron made 70 plate appearances for Boston in 2011, batting .143, before being designated for assignment on June 29.

===Florida Marlins===
On July 5, he was traded to the Florida Marlins for a player to be named later or cash considerations. He was released on September 13, 2011.

===Washington Nationals and retirement with Mariners===
On December 19, 2011, he agreed to a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals.

Cameron never played in any games for the Nationals and announced his retirement on February 19, 2012. He signed a one-day contract with Seattle on April 14, 2012, to officially retire as a Mariner before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at the Mariners&#x27; home opener that same day.

==Personal life==
Together with Greg Brown and Robin Roberts, Cameron wrote a book (aimed primarily at children) titled &quot;It Takes a Team: Mike Cameron&quot;, , where he presents his views on the importance of teamwork and describes his life. It was published in 2002 by Triumph Books.

After being selected to the American League All-Star Team in 2001, Cameron used his salary bonus to purchase All-Star Game warm-up jackets for all of his Seattle Mariner teammates. During his playing career he was known for routinely sitting on top of the dugout to sign autographs and talk with fans before games. He is also the founder of the Cam4Kids Foundation and was host of the First State Golf Tournament for Inner City Kids in Seattle in 2002; these in effort to raise money to provide scholarships to inner-city youth. He is actively involved with the Make-A-Wish Foundation as well as the Starlight Foundation.

Cameron married his former high school classmate, JaBreka, in or around 1999. As of 2002, they had three children, sons named Dazmon and Mehki and a daughter named T&#x27;aja. Cameron&#x27;s son, Daz Cameron, played baseball at Eagle&#x27;s Landing Christian Academy. He was drafted 37th overall by the Houston Astros in the 2015 MLB draft. Daz is currently an outfielder for the Oakland Athletics organization. On April 26, 2019, Mike returned to the Seattle Mariners as a Special Assignment Coach.

<text>Christian Metz (; December 12, 1931 – September 7, 1993) was a French film theorist, best known for pioneering film semiotics, the application of theories of signification to the cinema. During the 1970s, his work had a major impact on film theory in France, Britain, Latin America, and the United States. As Constance Penley flatly stated in &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;, &quot;Modern film theory begins with Metz.&quot;

==Biography==
Metz was born in Béziers.

He lectured at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS).

In 1964, he published the article &quot;Le cinéma : langue ou langage?&quot; (&quot;Cinema: language or language-system?&quot;) in the journal &quot;Communications&quot;, and the following books over the next 25 years: &quot;Essays on the Signification of Cinema&quot; (1968 and 1973), &quot;Language and Cinema&quot; (1971), &quot;Semiotic Essays&quot; (1977), &quot;The Imaginary Signifier: Psychoanalysis and the Cinema&quot; (1977).

In &quot;Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema&quot;, Metz focuses on narrative structure — proposing the &quot;Grand Syntagmatique&quot;, a system for categorizing scenes (known as &quot;syntagms&quot;) in films.

Metz applied both Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis and Jacques Lacan&#x27;s mirror theory to the cinema, proposing that the reason film is popular as an art form lies in its ability to be both an imperfect reflection of reality and a method to delve into the unconscious dream state.

His work has been critiqued by Jean Mitry in 1987 in &quot;Semiotics and the Analysis of Film&quot;, and virulently so by Jean-François Tarnowski in &quot;Positif&quot;.

In his final work, &quot;Impersonal Enunciation&quot;, Metz &quot;uses the concept of enunciation to articulate how films &#x27;speak&#x27; and explore where this communication occurs, offering critical direction for theorists who struggle with the phenomena of new media.&quot; Published in French in 1991, &quot;Impersonal Enunciation&quot; received little attention in the English-speaking world until it was translated in 2016, an indicator of a resurgence of interest in Metz as a scholar whose work on multi-screen environments was before its time.

Metz died in Paris, aged 61, having taken his own life.

<text>Douglas Dean Osheroff (born August 1, 1945) is an American physicist known for his work in experimental condensed matter physics, in particular for his co-discovery of superfluidity in Helium-3. For his contributions he shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics along with David Lee and Robert C. Richardson. Osheroff is currently the J. G. Jackson and C. J. Wood Professor of Physics, emeritus, at Stanford University.

==Life and work==
Osheroff was born in Aberdeen, Washington. His father, William Osheroff, was the son of Jewish immigrants who left Russia. His mother, Bessie Anne (Ondov), a nurse, was the daughter of Slovak immigrants (her own father was a Lutheran minister) from the Felvidék, Upper Hungary, Kingdom of Hungary.
Osheroff was confirmed in the Lutheran Church but he was given the chance to choose and decided not to attend any longer. He has stated &quot;In some sense it seemed that lying in church is the worst place to lie. I guess at some emotional level I accept the idea of God, but I don&#x27;t know how God would manifest itself.&quot;

Osheroff earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1967 from Caltech, where he attended lectures by Richard Feynman and did undergraduate research for Gerry Neugebauer.

Osheroff joined the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics at Cornell University as a graduate student, doing research in low-temperature physics. Together with David Lee, the head of the laboratory, and Robert C. Richardson, Osheroff used a Pomeranchuk cell to investigate the behaviour of 3He at temperatures within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero. They discovered unexpected effects in their measurements, which they eventually explained as phase transitions to a superfluid phase of 3He. Lee, Richardson and Osheroff were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1996 for this discovery.

Osheroff received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1973. He then worked at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey for 15 years, continuing to research low-temperature phenomena in 3He. In 1987 he moved to the Departments of Physics and Applied Physics at Stanford University, where he also served as department chair from 1993 to 1996. His research is focused on phenomena that occur at extremely low temperatures.

Osheroff was selected to serve on the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; investigation panel, serving much the same role as Richard Feynman did on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; panel.

He currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government.
Osheroff is left-handed, and he often blames his slight quirks and eccentricities on it. He is also an avid photographer and introduces students at Stanford to medium-format film photography in a freshman seminar titled &quot;Technical Aspects of Photography.&quot; In addition, he has taught the Stanford introductory physics course on electricity and magnetism on multiple occasions, most recently in Spring 2008, as well as undergraduate labs on low temperature physics.

Among his physics outreach activities, Osheroff participated in the science festivals for middle and high school students, is an official guest of honor at the International Young Physicists&#x27; Tournament 2013.

He married a biochemist, Phyllis Liu-Osheroff, in 1970.

Osheroff is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

==Awards and honors==
* Nobel Prize in Physics (1996)
* Simon Memorial Prize (1976)
* Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize (1981)

<text>USS &quot;PC-815&quot; was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. Its first commander, for about eighty days in 1943, was L. Ron Hubbard, who later became the founder of Scientology. After Hubbard was removed from command for conducting unauthorized gunnery practice in Mexican territorial waters, the &quot;PC-815&quot; served as a shore patrol vessel off San Diego, California.

In September 1945, the ship was lost along with one of her crew after colliding with the destroyer . &quot;PC-815&quot;″s short career led to the vessel being dubbed the &quot;jinxed sub-chaser&quot;.

== Construction ==
&quot;PC-815&quot; was laid down on 10 October 1942, at the Albina Engine and Machinery Works in Portland, Oregon. Her propulsion was two 1,440bhp Hooven-Owens-Rentschler R-99DA diesel engines (Serial No. 6977 and 6978), Westinghouse single reduction gear, two shafts.

The &quot;PC-815&quot; was fitted out commencing 5 December 1942, and was commissioned on 20 April 1943, with Lieutenant (j.g.) L. Ron Hubbard in command. A few weeks later she sailed down the Columbia River to Astoria, Oregon, where she arrived on 17 May to take on supplies.

On 18 May, the &quot;PC-815&quot; left Astoria for Bremerton, Washington, where she was to have radar and depth charge launchers fitted. Her journey was interrupted by an air-sea rescue operation, then was resumed with a new destination — San Diego.

== The &quot;jinxed sub-chaser&quot; ==

=== Claims of submarine contact off Cape Lookout ===
In the early hours of 19 May 1943, the crew of &quot;PC-815&quot; detected what Hubbard thought was first one, then later two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines approximately off the shore of Cape Lookout, Oregon. Both the sonar operator and Lt. Hubbard thought that the echo of an active sonar ping, combined with apparent engine noises heard through the ship&#x27;s hydrophone, indicated contact with a submarine.

Over the next 68 hours, the ship expended 37 depth charges in a &quot;battle&quot; that also involved the U.S. Navy blimps &quot;K-39&quot; and &quot;K-33&quot;, the United States Coast Guard patrol boats &quot;Bonham&quot; and 78302, and the subchasers USS &quot;SC-536&quot; and USS &quot;SC-537&quot;, all summoned to act as reinforcements. &quot;PC-815&quot; was finally ordered back to base on 21 May.

In his eighteen-page after-action report, Hubbard claimed to have &quot;definitely sunk, beyond doubt&quot; one submarine and critically damaged another. However, the subsequent investigation by the Commander NW Sea Frontier, Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, cast a skeptical light on Hubbard&#x27;s claims. His summary memorandum to Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, stated:

:It is noted that the report of &quot;PC 815&quot; is not in accordance with &quot;Anti-Submarine Action by Surface Ship&quot; (ASW-1) which should be submitted to Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet. An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The Commanding Officers of all ships except the &quot;PC-815&quot; state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area.

Fletcher added that &quot;there is a known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped&quot;, absolving the responding blimps from any fault, because their method of detecting submarines relied on a Magnetic Anomaly Detector. This also implied that Lt. Hubbard and his crew were operating the ship&#x27;s sonar equipment incorrectly. After the war, British and American analysis of captured Japanese Navy records confirmed that no Japanese submarines had been lost off the Oregon coast. Hubbard, however, never accepted that he had been mistaken about the &quot;battle.&quot; Both he and Tom Moulton, one of his officers, claimed that the official denials of any Japanese submarine presence off the Pacific coast had been motivated by a desire to avoid panic among the U.S. population. Years later, Hubbard told Scientologists:

:I dropped the &quot;I-76&quot; or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine down into the mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. I never thought about it again particularly except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? But the other day I was kind of tired, and my dad suddenly sprung on me the fact that my submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River. Hadn&#x27;t thought about this thing for years. Of course, it&#x27;s all shot to ribbons, this thing. It&#x27;s got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it&#x27;s a big submarine! It&#x27;s a — I don&#x27;t know, about the size of the first &quot;Narwhal&quot; that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it&#x27;s just tearing their nets to ribbons — they&#x27;ve even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there — and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I&#x27;d care to count.

However, the mouth of the Columbia River is some 75 miles north of Cape Lookout, the area in which Hubbard&#x27;s naval reports claimed his anti-submarine action took place.

Moreover, the Japanese submarine &quot;I-76&quot; (renamed &quot;I-176&quot; by that time) was based in Truk and operated only in the south Pacific during the time when Hubbard was in command of &quot;PC-815&quot;. The I-176 was sunk in the Coral Sea in May 1944 and removed from the Japanese Navy List on 10 July 1944 – a year after Hubbard was relieved of command of the &quot;PC-815&quot;.

=== Unauthorized shelling of Coronado Islands and failure to follow orders ===
In June 1943, the &quot;PC-815&quot; traveled to San Diego, which was to become her home port. She arrived there on 2 June, and at the end of June was ordered to sea to join an anti-submarine training exercise. The exercise, held on 28 June, ended early. Hubbard took the opportunity to order an impromptu gunnery exercise while anchored just off the Mexican territory of South Coronado Island, to the south-west of San Diego. The Mexican government sent an official protest to the U.S. Government, as no gunnery operations had been scheduled.
On 30 June a Board of Investigation was convened concerning &quot;PC-815&quot;. It concluded that Hubbard had disregarded orders, both by conducting gunnery practice and by anchoring in Mexican territorial waters without proper authority. His orders stated that the &quot;PC-815&quot; was supposed to return after completing that day&#x27;s training. Hubbard argued that his crew was inexperienced, it was foggy, and he was tired so he did not return to port as ordered. But a month earlier in his after action report concerning the fiasco off Cape Lookout, he had described the same men as &quot;experienced&quot; and &quot;highly skilled&quot;.

Vice Admiral Fletcher, who both chaired the board and read the prior after action report, rated Hubbard &quot;below average&quot; and noted: &quot;Consider this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised&quot;. Hubbard was relieved of command effective 7 July 1943.

== Collision with USS &quot;Laffey&quot; ==
After Hubbard was replaced, &quot;PC-815&quot; remained in San Diego as a shore patrol vessel, but appears to have been mostly inactive. According to her Movement Card she took part in the occasional offshore patrol, participated in training exercises, and escorted submarines in and out of the harbor. She was restored to active duty on 2 September 1945, but at 6:47 a.m. on 11 September, the ship collided with the destroyer in dense fog off San Diego. The collision started a fire on board &quot;PC-815&quot;, which sank within five minutes. One man from &quot;PC-815&quot; was recorded as missing, presumed drowned. The &quot;Laffey&quot; suffered significant damage, with the fire from &quot;PC-815&quot; spreading into one of the destroyer&#x27;s compartments.

Navy divers demolished the wreck in early November 1945 due to the navigation hazard that it posed to a busy shipping channel. It is reported to be lying at in of water and is said to be diveable.

<text>The flag of Georgia (), also known as the Five-Cross Flag (, ), is one of the national symbols of Georgia. Originally a banner of the medieval Kingdom of Georgia, it was repopularised in the late 20th and early 21st centuries during the Georgian national revival.

== History ==
The current flag was used by the Georgian patriotic movement following the country&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the late 1990s, the design had become widely known as the Georgian historical national flag, as vexillologists had pointed out the red-on-white Jerusalem cross shown as the flag of Tbilisi in a 14th-century map by Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano.

A majority of Georgians, including the influential Catholicos-Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, supported the restoration of the flag and in 1999 the Parliament of Georgia passed a bill to change the flag. However, it was not endorsed by the then-President Eduard Shevardnadze. It was adopted in the early 2000s by the main opposition party, the United National Movement led by Mikheil Saakashvili, as a symbol of popular resistance to Shevardnadze&#x27;s rule as well as a symbol of the Rose Revolution.

The flag was adopted by Parliament on 14 January 2004. Saakashvili formally endorsed it via Presidential Decree No. 31 signed on 25 January, following his election as president. 14 January is annually marked as a Flag Day in Georgia.

In 2021, a coin was discovered, minted during the reign of King David IV. According to Georgia&#x27;s State Council of Heraldry, the engraving on its reverse side displays a &quot;folded five-cross composition&quot; and thus is an unmistakable historical connection of the design of the Georgian national flag with King David IV.

== Design ==
The national flag of Georgia, as described in the decree:

The Georgian national flag is a white rectangle, with a large red cross in its central portion
 touching all four sides of the flag. In the four corners there are four &quot;bolnur-katskhuri&quot; crosses (also referred to as a Georgian Cross or a Grapevine cross) of the same color as the large cross.


== Previous flags ==


=== Early Georgian states ===

The first Georgian flag design came about during the era of the early Georgian state, the Principality of Iberia which had a red cross against a white background, similar to the flag of England.
The subsequent Principality of Tao-Klarjeti shared this same flag.

=== Medieval Georgian flags ===


The white flag with the single red St. George&#x27;s cross was supposedly used by King Vakhtang I in the 5th century. According to tradition, King Tamar (d. 1213) used a flag with a dark red cross and a star in a white field. In the 1367 map by Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano, the flag of &quot;Tifilis&quot; (Tbilisi) is shown as a Jerusalem cross (a large cross with smaller crosses in each quarter). According to D. Kldiashvili (1997), the Jerusalem cross might have been adopted during the reign of King George V.

=== After the collapse of the Kingdom of Georgia ===

=== Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–1921) ===

During Georgia&#x27;s brief existence as an independent state as the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921, a flag consisting of a dark red field with black and white bands in the canton was adopted. The design resulted from a national flag-designing contest won by the painter Iakob Nikoladze. It was abolished by the Soviet Union following the 1921 incorporation of Georgia into the USSR. After the collapse of the USSR, Georgia adopted a modified version with the length extended (see below).

=== Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (1921–1991) ===


During the Soviet period, Georgia adopted several variants of the red Soviet flag incorporating first the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic&#x27;s name, and later a red hammer and sickle with a star in a blue sun in the canton and a blue bar in the upper part of flag. The flag of the Georgian SSR was replaced by the flag of the Democratic Republic of Georgia by the Georgian government in November 1990, shortly before it declared independence from the Soviet Union.

=== Georgia (1991–2004) ===

The previous flag used by the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 was reestablished as the flag of the Republic of Georgia on 8 December 1991, by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia. However, it lost popularity thereafter as it became associated with the chaotic and violent period after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The wine-red colour symbolises the good times of the past as well as the future, whilst the black represents Russian rule, and the white represents hope for peace. This flag was later replaced by the current Georgian flag following the bloodless Rose Revolution. The flag is still used by supporters of former president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.

<doc id="431926" wikidata="Q323063" url="?curid=431926" title="Wolf Biermann">
<text>Karl Wolf Biermann (; born 15 November 1936) is a German singer-songwriter, poet, and former East German dissident. He is perhaps best known for the 1968 song &quot;Ermutigung&quot; and his expatriation from East Germany in 1976.

==Early life==
Biermann was born in Hamburg, Germany. His mother, Emma (née Dietrich), was a German Communist Party activist, and his father, Dagobert Biermann, worked on the Hamburg docks. Biermann&#x27;s father, a Jewish member of the German Resistance, was sentenced to six years in prison for sabotaging Nazi ships. In 1942, the Nazis decided to eliminate their Jewish political prisoners and Biermann&#x27;s father was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was murdered on 22 February 1943.

Biermann was one of the few children of workers who attended the Heinrich-Hertz-Gymnasium (high school) in Hamburg. After the Second World War, he became a member of the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend, FDJ) and in 1950, he represented the Federal Republic of Germany at the FDJ&#x27;s first national meeting.

==East Germany==

Upon finishing school at the age of 17, Biermann emigrated from West to East Germany where he believed he could live out his Communist ideals. He lived at a boarding school near Schwerin until 1955, and then began studying political economics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. From 1957 to 1959, he was an assistant director at the Berliner Ensemble. At university he changed courses to study philosophy and mathematics under Wolfgang Heise until 1963, when he completed his thesis. Despite his successful defense of his thesis, he did not receive his diploma until 2008 when he was also awarded an honorary doctorate degree.

In 1960, Biermann met composer Hanns Eisler, who adopted the young artist as a protégé. Biermann began writing poetry and songs. Eisler used his influence with the East German cultural elite to promote the songwriter&#x27;s career, but his death in 1962 deprived Biermann of his mentor and protector. In 1961, Biermann formed the &quot;Berliner Arbeiter-Theater&quot; (&quot;Berlin Workers&#x27; Theater&quot;), which was closed in 1963 before the production of Biermann&#x27;s show &quot;Berliner Brautgang&quot;, which documented the building of the Berlin Wall. The play was officially banned and Biermann was forbidden to perform for six months.

Although a committed communist, Biermann&#x27;s nonconformist views soon alarmed the East German establishment. In 1963, he was refused membership in the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), although no reason was given at the time for his rejection. After the Wende, documents available from Biermann&#x27;s file at the Stasi Records Agency revealed that the reviewers were under the impression that he was a regular user of stimulants, leading to the rejection of his application.

In 1964, Biermann performed for the first time in West Germany. A performance in April 1965 in Frankfurt am Main on Wolfgang Neuss&#x27; cabaret program was recorded and released as an LP titled &quot;Wolf Biermann (Ost) zu Gast bei Wolfgang Neuss (West)&quot;. Later that year, Biermann published a book of poetry, &quot;Die Drahtharfe&quot;, through the West German publisher Klaus Wagenbach. In December 1965, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany denounced him as a &quot;class traitor&quot; and placed him onto the performance and publication blacklist. At this time, the Stasi developed a 20-point plan to &quot;degrade&quot; or discredit his person.

While blacklisted, Biermann continued to write and compose, culminating in his 1968 album &quot;Chausseestraße 131&quot;, recorded on equipment smuggled from the west in his apartment at Chausseestraße 131 in Mitte, the central borough of Berlin.

To break this isolation, artists like Joan Baez and many others visited him at his home during the World Festival of Youth and Students in 1973. Karsten Voigt, chairman of the West German Socialdemocratic Youth (&quot;Jusos&quot;) protested against the suppression of the freedom of opinion and information by the state security.

==Deprivation of citizenship==

In 1976, while Biermann was on an officially sanctioned tour of West Germany, the GDR government stripped him of his citizenship. He was not allowed to return to the GDR. Biermann&#x27;s exile provoked protests by leading East German intellectuals, including actor Armin Mueller-Stahl and novelist Christa Wolf.

In 1977, he was joined in West Germany by his wife at the time, Christine Barg, as well as actress Eva-Maria Hagen, her daughter Catharina (Nina Hagen), and Sibylle Havemann, the daughter of Robert Havemann and mother of two of Biermann&#x27;s children. In West Germany, his manager was the musician Diether Dehm, who was secretly a Stasi informer reporting on Biermann&#x27;s activities to the GDR authorities.

==After moving to West Germany==
Now living in the West, Biermann continued his musical career, criticizing East Germany&#x27;s Stalinist policies. He was able to perform publicly again in East Germany on 1 and 2 December 1989 during the Wende that eventually toppled the Communist government. In 1998, he received the German national prize. He supported the 1999 NATO Kosovo War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the Arab–Israeli conflict he supports Israel and is critical of the fact, as he sees it, that, under the influence of antisemitic views, a majority of Germans lack both understanding and empathy for the Israeli side. He lives in Hamburg and in France. He is the father of ten children, three of them with his second wife Pamela Biermann, née Rüsche.

==Selected works==
* &quot;Wolf Biermann zu Gast bei Wolfgang Neuss&quot; (LP, 1965)
* &quot;Chausseestraße 131&quot; (LP, 1969): recorded in his home in East Berlin, published in the West. Possessing home-recording charm, one can hear the noises from the streets. The German texts are very sarcastic, ironic, and to the point. This LP was recorded with a recorder smuggled in from West Germany and the title of the album was his address at the time, letting the political police know exactly who and where he was at the time.
* &quot;aah-ja!&quot; (LP, 1974)

<doc id="431928" wikidata="Q7840359" url="?curid=431928" title="Tribe 8">
<text>Tribe 8 was a lesbian punk rock band from San Francisco, considered one of the first queercore groups. The band took their name from the practice of tribadism, with &quot;tribe eight&quot; being a play on the word &quot;tribade&quot;, a sexual practice sometimes also known as &quot;scissoring.&quot;

== Band members ==
The makeup of the group changed over time, but Lynn Breedlove and Leslie Mah (formerly of Anti-Scrunti Faction) were consistent members. Other members included Flipper (Silas Howard), Slade Bellum, Jen Schwartz, Mama T, Kat Buell, and Tantrum.

== Concerts ==
In concert, lead singer Breedlove frequently performed shirtless, wearing a strap-on dildo, and encouraged audience members to interact with it. Their songs often deal with subjects such as S/M, nudity, fellatio, and transgender issues, and the band was the subject of controversy because of this. An article from the Chicago Tribune praised their Fireside Bowl show in 1998 stating &quot;If the members of Tribe 8 play punk rock like they own it, it&#x27;s only because they do.&quot;

Tribe 8 toured throughout the United States, playing at venues such as DUMBA and 924 Gilman Street; they also played in Europe and Canada, and released a number of recordings on independent record labels.

In 1996, the band made its screen debut in &quot;A Gun For Jennifer&quot;, directed by Todd Morris. The band performs live in the documentary film &quot;She&#x27;s Real, Worse Than Queer&quot; by Lucy Thane, released in 1997. Members of the band are also interviewed, speaking about a range of topics including the development of the queercore music scene. In 2003 the film &quot;Rise Above: A Tribe 8 Documentary&quot;, by director Tracy Flannigan, was released, documenting not only performances by the band but the motivations and reasons behind the band and the part it plays in their lives. The movie has won many awards at film festivals throughout the U.S.

== Other work ==
Outside of the band, Lynn Breedlove is also the author of a novel, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, published in 2002, now translated into German as &quot;Goetterspeed&quot;, and a memoir &quot;Lynnee Breedlove&#x27;s One Freak Show&quot; published in 2009, winner of the 2010 Lambda Award for Transgender Writing. Leslie Mah has appeared in various films including &quot;The Yo-Yo Gang&quot; by G. B. Jones; &quot;Shut Up White Boy&quot;, co-directed by Vu T. and Thu Ha; and produced her own film, &quot;Estrofemme&quot;, in 1998. Breedlove wrote, co-directed, co-produced, and starred in a short film, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, based on his novel. It debuted in festivals in 2007. It features Jillian Lauren, Adam Horowitz, Leslie Mah, and Bucky Sinister, with cameos by Meliza Banales and Jewelle Gomez. His comedy solo show on trans bodies, community and feminism, &quot;Lynnee Breedlove&#x27;s One Freak Show&quot;, toured worldwide from 2004 to 2009. He now runs Homobiles, a queer ride service.

Outside of Tribe 8, Jen Schwartz is a solo singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer who released her debut album &quot;Candy from a Stranger&quot; in 2000. She also owns Rampage Productions, a service business for musicians in Los Angeles. In 2010, she formed the band Me of a Kind. Me of a Kind&#x27;s debut album is slated for release in the fall of 2010 on the Rampage Productions label.

<text>A cold air intake (CAI) is usually an aftermarket assembly of parts used to bring relatively cool air into a car&#x27;s internal-combustion engine.

Most vehicles manufactured from the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic air intake systems that regulate the temperature of the air entering the engine&#x27;s intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel injection methods, modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic air intake system and the factory-installed air intake draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold air intake systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold air intake is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit, than warmer air.

==Design features==
Some strategies used in designing aftermarket cold air intakes are:
*Reworking parts of the intake that create turbulence to reduce air resistance.
*Providing a more direct route to the air intake by eliminating muffling devices.
*Shortening the length of the intake.
*Placing the intake duct to use the ram-air effect to give positive pressure at speed.

==Construction==
Intake systems come in many different styles and can be constructed from plastic, metal, rubber (silicone) or composite materials (fiberglass, carbon fiber or Kevlar). Tubing can be steel, stainless steel, aluminum, plastic, or a combination of materials. The most efficient intake systems utilize an airbox which is sized to complement the engine and will extend the powerband of the engine. The intake snorkel (opening for the intake air to enter the system) must be large enough to ensure sufficient air is available to the engine under all conditions from idle to full throttle.

The most basic cold air intake consists of a long metal or plastic tube leading to a conical air filter. Power may be lost at certain engine speeds and gained at others. Because of the reduced covering, intake noise is usually increased.

Some intakes use heat shields to isolate the air filter from the rest of the engine compartment, providing cooler air from the front or side of the engine bay. This can make a big difference to intake temperatures, especially when the car is moving slowly. Some systems, called &quot;fender mount,&quot; move the filter into the fender wall instead. This system draws air up through the fender wall, which provides even more isolation and still cooler air.

==Cold air intake efficiency==
The following items can have an effect on CAI efficiency:
*Output location of the CAI unit.
*Obstruction by side and front parts of the vehicle (e.g., headlights).
*Length and geometry of intake air tube. The shortest length tube with a smooth interior has a positive effect on increasing airflow.

* Carburetor heat
* Heated air inlet
* Warm air intake
* Ram-air intake
* Intercooler

<text>Desmond Sandford &quot;Sandy&quot; Hawley, (born April 16, 1949) is a Canadian Hall of Fame jockey.

Sandy Hawley was born in Oshawa, Ontario, decided to be a jockey when he was a 17-year-old boy, hotwalking, grooming horses at a Woodbine racetrack in Toronto Ontario. When he was 19 years old, he rode his first race at Woodbine race track as a Jockey. Then he became a regular rider at racetracks in Ontario and then rode at racetracks on the East Coast of the United States. Hawley became the first jockey to ever lead the Canadian standings in a full season as an apprentice. In 1969, a time when there were no Sovereign or Eclipse Awards for jockeys, Hawley rode 230 winners, the most that year of any apprentice jockey in North America. He went on to race in the United States where he led all jockeys in victories for the years 1970, 1972, 1973 and 1976. In the 1973 season, he became the first jockey to ever win 500 races in one year, breaking Bill Shoemaker&#x27;s record. Sandy Hawley has career earnings of over $88.6 million and was one of the most successful jockeys of his generation.

Racing in California, Hawley was named the winner of Santa Anita Park&#x27;s prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. Given to a North American rider who demonstrates the highest of standards of personal and professional conduct both on and off the racetrack, Hawley has had the lifelong reputation of being a gentleman and a man of honor. In 1976 he won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey in the United States after he broke thoroughbred racing&#x27;s all-time money-winning record for a single year.

As a boy growing up in Canada, Hawley developed a love for the game of ice hockey and while riding in California, he got an ice-level job as a penalty timekeeper for the home games of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, giving himself a great view of his favorite game.

He won the Lou Marsh Trophy in 1973 and 1976 as Canada’s top athlete and was named a Member of the Order of Canada, his country’s highest individual civilian honor for outstanding accomplishments by a citizen.

In addition to winning many major Stakes races in the United States, four times he won Canada&#x27;s most prestigious thoroughbred horse race, the Queen&#x27;s Plate. Twice, Hawley won seven races in a single day at Toronto’s Woodbine Racetrack and at Santa Anita Park had six wins in a single day on two occasions. Hawley and Avelino Gomez each won the Coronation Futurity Stakes a record five times. Gomez won the race four years running between 1964 and 1967. Hawley won the race five out of six years between 1971 and 1976, his streak broken by Gomez&#x27;s fifth win in 1972.

Hawley&#x27;s best result in the Kentucky Derby was two third-place finishes one of which was with Golden Act in 1979 aboard whom he finished second in both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.

Overall, Sandy Hawley&#x27;s career as a jockey spanned 31 years from 1968 to his retirement on July 1, 1998. He had 31,455 mounts, garnering 6,449 wins and won 18 riding titles at Woodbine Racetrack.

Diagnosed with skin cancer in 1987, doctors only gave him a few months to live but he fought to overcome the disease with experimental drugs, a careful high-fiber diet, and his sheer determination.

Sandy Hawley was voted the 1986 Avelino Gomez Memorial Award and that same year was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the United States National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1992 and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.

The Sandy Hawley Award is presented every year by the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame to an individual who best exemplifies a dedication to the community.

He currently is a Public Relations Ambassador for Woodbine Entertainment Group, and resides in Toronto, Ontario with his wife Kaoru. He has worked as an analyst for The Score and CKXT-TV&#x27;s horse racing coverage.

Sandy met a fellow Jockey Kaoru Tsuchiya when they were riding at Keeneland Race Track in 1987. The two were married in Lexington, Kentucky on March 10, 2019.

 Sandy and his wife are working with the team of retired jockeys to help the permanently disabled Jockeys fund in many of the Community Association for Riding for the Disabled former and current volunteers.

==Living Legends Race==
On October 18, 2008 at Santa Anita Park, Sandy Hawley and seven other U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockeys came out of retirement for the Living Legends Race that officially counted in their career totals and was specially approved for legalized parimutuel wagering. Hawley earned his 6,450th official career victory with a win aboard Tribal Chief, a horse owned by musician/record producer Herb Alpert and his brother David Alpert.

<doc id="431940" wikidata="Q5140810" url="?curid=431940" title="Coequalizer">
<text>In category theory, a coequalizer (or coequaliser) is a generalization of a quotient by an equivalence relation to objects in an arbitrary category. It is the categorical construction dual to the equalizer.

== Definition ==
A coequalizer is the colimit of a diagram consisting of two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and two parallel morphisms .

More explicitly, a coequalizer of the parallel morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; can be defined as an object &quot;Q&quot; together with a morphism such that . Moreover, the pair must be universal in the sense that given any other such pair (&quot;Q&quot;′, &quot;q&quot;′) there exists a unique morphism such that . This information can be captured by the following commutative diagram:

As with all universal constructions, a coequalizer, if it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism (this is why, by abuse of language, one sometimes speaks of &quot;the&quot; coequalizer of two parallel arrows).

It can be shown that a coequalizing arrow &quot;q&quot; is an epimorphism in any category.

== Examples ==
* In the category of sets, the coequalizer of two functions is the quotient of &quot;Y&quot; by the smallest equivalence relation ~ such that for every , we have . In particular, if &quot;R&quot; is an equivalence relation on a set &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;r&quot;1, &quot;r&quot;2 are the natural projections then the coequalizer of &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 is the quotient set . (See also: quotient by an equivalence relation.)
* The coequalizer in the category of groups is very similar. Here if are group homomorphisms, their coequalizer is the quotient of &quot;Y&quot; by the normal closure of the set
*: formula_1
* For abelian groups the coequalizer is particularly simple. It is just the factor group . (This is the cokernel of the morphism ; see the next section).
* In the category of topological spaces, the circle object &quot;S&quot;1 can be viewed as the coequalizer of the two inclusion maps from the standard 0-simplex to the standard 1-simplex.
* Coequalizers can be large: There are exactly two functors from the category 1 having one object and one identity arrow, to the category 2 with two objects and one non-identity arrow going between them. The coequalizer of these two functors is the monoid of natural numbers under addition, considered as a one-object category. In particular, this shows that while every coequalizing arrow is epic, it is not necessarily surjective.

== Properties ==
* Every coequalizer is an epimorphism.
* In a topos, every epimorphism is the coequalizer of its kernel pair.

== Special cases ==
In categories with zero morphisms, one can define a &quot;cokernel&quot; of a morphism &quot;f&quot; as the coequalizer of &quot;f&quot; and the parallel zero morphism.

In preadditive categories it makes sense to add and subtract morphisms (the hom-sets actually form abelian groups). In such categories, one can define the coequalizer of two morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; as the cokernel of their difference:
: coeq(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) = coker(&quot;g&quot; – &quot;f&quot;).

A stronger notion is that of an absolute coequalizer, this is a coequalizer that is preserved under all functors.
Formally, an absolute coequalizer of a pair of parallel arrows in a category &quot;C&quot; is a coequalizer as defined above, but with the added property that given any functor , &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;) together with &quot;F&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) is the coequalizer of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) in the category &quot;D&quot;. Split coequalizers are examples of absolute coequalizers.

<text>Fania Records is a New York–based record label founded by Dominican-born composer and bandleader Johnny Pacheco and his American lawyer Jerry Masucci in 1964. The label took its name from a popular luncheonette frequented by musicians in Havana, Cuba that Masucci frequented when he worked for a public relations firm there during the pre-Castro era. Fania is known for its promotion of salsa music.

==History==
Frustrated by the meager amount of money he was receiving for his recordings, Johnny Pacheco started Fania in 1964 and sold records to music stores out of the trunk of his car. To help finance the business, he consolidated with his Brooklyn-born Italian lawyer and promoter Jerry Masucci, and in 1964 founded the Fania label to produce, promote and market the music of Latinos in New York. The label started out as a small venture, but gained popularity after the success of Johnny Pacheco&#x27;s first official record, &quot;Cañonazo&quot; (Fania 321), leading to the expansion of its talent base that Pacheco envisioned. Among Fania&#x27;s signature stars are Pete &quot;El Conde&quot; Rodríguez, Hector Casanova, Rey Reyes, Willie Colón, Celia Cruz, Eric Gale, Larry Harlow, Ray Barretto, Ralfi Pagan, Luis &quot;Perico&quot; Ortiz, Bobby Valentín, Rubén Blades, Héctor Lavoe, Cheo Feliciano, Adalberto Santiago, Ismael Miranda and many others.

In 1968, Pacheco created a supergroup known as the Fania All-Stars that brought together the elite of his salsa musicians and singers for joint performances and recording. They made their debut at the Red Garter club located in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, but it was their 1971 performance at the Cheetah, a club in Midtown Manhattan, which became legendary. Pacheco was music director and guided the band on stage. The Fania All-Stars were filmed for the documentary &quot;Our Latin Thing&quot; released a year later.

In 1970 Masucci and Pacheco launched Fania&#x27;s sub-label Vaya Records. In the first years of the Vaya label, Masucci and Pacheco signed the duo Ricardo &quot;Richie&quot; Ray and Bobby Cruz, along with Celia Cruz, Mongo Santamaria and Cheo Feliciano. In the following year, Vaya acquired Cotique Records.

In 1973, Fania All-Stars performed at Yankee Stadium to a stadium with 45,000 attendees. Pacheco directed the band to an excited crowd who cheered on each Fania All-Star member.

As of 2007 all that is left is &quot;Larry Harlow and the Latin Legends of Fania&quot;. In 2003, the 1975 Fania release &quot;Live at Yankee Stadium&quot; was included in the second set of 50 recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry. Masucci, who had bought out Pacheco&#x27;s share of the company around 1967, became the sole owner of Fania Records and the numerous other labels and umbrella labels in South America that he acquired and created. Masucci died in 1997, and for the next eight years Fania and all of its assets were tied up in probate court while various parties battled over its ownership.

In September 2005, Fania&#x27;s assets were sold to V2 Records and Miami-based label Emusica, and by early 2006, the new owners began to reissue material from Fania&#x27;s backlog catalog (some of which has never appeared on CD before) with enhanced sound and liner notes. In an effort to create additional content, Código Records, a subsidiary of the Emusica label, allowed DJs and producers to remix original material.

As of July 27, 2018, Fania is owned by Concord, which acquired the label from Codigo Entertainment. Fania&#x27;s catalogue included 19,000 master recordings and 8,000 compositions.

<doc id="431942" wikidata="Q2371986" url="?curid=431942" title="Champlain Regional College">
<text>Champlain Regional College is an English-language &quot;Collège d&#x27;enseignement général et professionnel&quot; (CEGEP) with campuses located in three distinct administrative regions of Quebec: Lennoxville, Saint-Lambert, and Quebec City. The college offers post-secondary pre-university and technical DEC diploma programs as well as vocational AEC certificate programs.

==History==
The college was founded in 1971 and named in honour of Samuel de Champlain, the first governor of New France. It traces its origins to the merger of several educational institutions which became public in 1967 with the creation of Quebec&#x27;s CEGEPs and the collegiate system.

==Organization and administration==

Champlain Regional College (CRC) is composed of an Administrative Office located in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and three campuses located in different regions of the province: Champlain College Lennoxville, in the Estrie; Champlain College Saint-Lambert, in the Montérégie; and Champlain College St. Lawrence, in the Capitale-Nationale area. Despite having &quot;Regional&quot; in its name, CRC is not a regional college as defined by Quebec&#x27;s General and Vocational Colleges Act. The only regional college under the Act is the Cégep régional de Lanaudière, which has a much more decentralized structure. This more decentralized structure has been proposed to the Board of Governors by administrators as a possible new organizational model for the college, but it was rejected as unworkable for CRC, in part due to the distances between the campuses.

The Director General and Director of Studies are based at the Sherbrooke Administrative offices along with the Director of Financial Services, the Director of Material Resources, Director of Human Resources and Secretary General, Coordinator of Information Technology, and their respective staff teams. All teaching and direct services to students are offered on the three campuses only.

The college is overseen by a Board of Governors with representation divided over the regions, following the usual structure except that CRC has one more faculty member on the Board than other public colleges, to ensure faculty representation from each campus and to account for the campuses&#x27; isolation from each other. Many members of the college community complain that their regions are underrepresented on the board, because its membership is divided between the four locations, giving the Estrie region approximately half of the board members. The 16-member Commission of Studies is also composed of Sherbrooke administrators plus faculty, staff and students from each teaching location.

Each campus is overseen by a Campus Director under the authority of the Director General. Each campus has administrators in charge of local management of human resources, finances, buildings and grounds, information technology, student services, registrar&#x27;s office, and continuing education, all under the Campus Director&#x27;s authority but also answerable to Administrators in Sherbrooke. Occasional issues arise due to this doubling of administrative services between Sherbrooke and the Campuses.

==Campuses==
CRC has three teaching locations:

===Champlain College Saint-Lambert===

The St. Lambert campus is located 148 kilometres from the College&#x27;s Head Office, on the South Shore of Montreal Island in the Montérégie town of Saint-Lambert. It offers pre-university and technical DEC programs, as well as AEC programs and an extensive range of other continuing education services (including Recognition of Acquired Competencies or RAC) both on and off campus.

===Champlain College Lennoxville===

The Lennoxville campus is located only seven kilometres from head office in the Estrie region, in the Sherbrooke borough of Lennoxville, where it shares grounds and facilities with Bishop&#x27;s University. It offers pre-university and technical DEC programs on its main campus as well as AEC programs and other continuing education services at a separate location.

===Champlain College St. Lawrence===

The St. Lawrence campus is located 227 kilometres from the Sherbrooke office in Capitale-Nationale region, in the Québec City borough of Ste-Foy. Originally an independent Classical College affiliated with Université Laval, this campus offers primarily pre-university DEC programs, one technical DEC program, and one AEC program. It is the only fully-English Cégep in Eastern Québec.

The college administrative offices are located apart from the teaching locations in the city of Sherbrooke.

The regional and cultural differences between the campuses have led to a debate over the value of the multi-regional structure of the college. Many members of the college community argue this structure limits campuses&#x27; ability to respond as well as they might to their students&#x27; and local communities&#x27; needs, while others argue that regional diversity creates opportunities for &quot;synergy&quot; across multiple regions of Quebec, even though there is little interaction between the campuses due to the vast distances between them. Some contact is facilitated by participation in college-wide bodies such as the Commission of Studies.

==Distinct culture and traditions==

In part due to regional disparity and distances, each campus has, over time, developed its own distinct culture and traditions. Contributing to this is also the fact that union contracts apply to the individual campuses rather than to the college as a whole, meaning that each location has its own separate teaching, professional and support staff unions, with little chance for job mobility between locations. Meetings of college-wide bodies are often held in rented space in the city of Drummondville, which is more or less equidistant from each of the three campuses and the Sherbrooke administrative offices. Communication between the campuses is rare below the management level.

==Controversy over the Regional Structure==
Since early 2014, a movement has re-emerged among the faculty and staff of Champlain College, in favour of creating three colleges from the campuses and eliminating the Sherbrooke administration office, which they consider distant from educational realities on the campuses and detrimental to the campuses&#x27; success. This movement first appeared in the 1990s. The more recent version began at the St-Lawrence Campus, which had been an independent institution prior to the formation of CRC. There, all three unions (faculty, support staff and professionals) have been working together since early in 2014 to make their campus an independent college.

In separate General Assemblies in the Fall of 2014, the faculty union of the St-Lambert Campus took a position in favour of St-Lawrence independence, and subsequently voted to support independence for St-Lambert. In December 2014, the &quot;Fédération Nationale des Enseignantes et Enseignants du Québec&quot; (Quebec Teachers&#x27; Federation, or FNEEQ) passed a unanimous motion at its Federal Council supporting the move for campus independence. Support Staff at Champlain St-Lambert also voted to seek independence for their campus in March, 2015. This was followed in March, 2016 by unanimous support from the provincial &quot;Fédération des Employées et Employés du Secteur Publique&quot; (FEESP: Public Sector Employees Federation), Cégep sector.

In February 2015, a campaign to promote the St-Lawrence Campus&#x27; independence was officially launched with support from FNEEQ, a supporting web page, and student-created video. Teachers from St-Lambert campus traveled to Quebec City to attend the launch, stating their hope that this would also lead to independence for their own campus. A formal petition was sponsored at the Québec National Assembly by the Official Opposition Critic for Higher Education, Véronique Hivon (Parti-Québécois). The St-Lambert staff and faculty took a table and presented a petition during the &quot;St-Lambert Days&quot; street festival that summer. In April, the teachers&#x27; union at the Lennoxville campus passed a General Assembly motion supporting their colleagues&#x27; push for independence at the other two campuses.

College administrators officially oppose this movement, and say they consider it a matter of &quot;deep concern.&quot; Nevertheless, after the Director of Studies resigned in November, 2014 to take a position at another college, campus autonomy arose several times at the Board of Governors due to the observed difficulty of fulfilling the role of Director of Studies in a multi-regional structure. During most of the following year, the Board of Governors unsuccessfully explored a variety of ideas for improving the structure of the academic leadership of the college while maintaining the institutional structure, and hired an outside consultant to specifically examine the Director of Studies role. The consultant&#x27;s report stated that under the current structure &quot;[there] is no value-added brought by the Director of Studies... . This person is in charge of all the important dossiers and yet, does not control anything.&quot; The consultant recommended that pedagogical leadership should become much more decentralized, with a separate Director of Studies for each campus, because this would provide leadership that is currently lacking according to the report, create less confusion, and make the college more responsive to students&#x27; needs. Despite this, in a series of votes over several subsequent meetings, the Board opted instead to maintain the status quo.

At its June meeting in 2015, the Board voted 10 to 4 to reaffirm the current multi-regional structure. Notwithstanding this, at the following Board meeting, the Director General and acting director of Studies moved and seconded a resolution calling for the Board to request a change to the structural model used by the Cégep Régional de Lanaudière, which is much more decentralized. They then both spoke and voted against their own motion, which was defeated, 7 to 4. The Board then suspended its review of the Director of Studies position and proceeded to work towards finding candidates for the vacant position while retaining the status quo structure.

The Campus independence movement continues to assert that the best change would be the elimination of the Central Administration in favour of creating three separate colleges, one per region. In April, 2016, the majority of college employees at St-Lambert and St-Lawrence campuses voted to cease participating at the Board of Governors until the college&#x27;s institutional problems were resolved. In November 2016, several hundred people attended a rally supporting independence for the campuses, while in December 2016 the college reiterated its support for the current structure.

The college returned to this issue in Spring, 2017, when the Sherbrooke office began further centralizing control of campus affairs by having certain managers report directly to Sherbrooke rather than to the local campus authorities. This began at the Saint-Lawrence campus, where it was extremely controversial. The proposal was then presented to the Board of Governors for its approbation, and after an in-camera meeting in late June 2017, at which representatives of each employee group were invited to speak to the question, the college announced in a letter to all employees that it was withdrawing this centralization plan.

In August 2017, David Birnbaum, MNA for the Montreal riding of Darcy-Mcgee, prepared a report at the request of the Minister of Higher Education. This report, while putting aside the idea of independent status for the three campuses, nonetheless recommended that the college be greatly decentralized in a number of ways, particularly with regard to academic leadership. In response to this, the campus unions returned representatives to the Board, which committed itself to studying and implementing the &quot;Birnbaum Report.&quot;

<doc id="431949" wikidata="Q3485529" url="?curid=431949" title="Black people and Mormonism">
<text>During the history of the Latter Day Saint movement, the relationship between Black people and Mormonism has included enslavement, exclusion and inclusion, and official and unofficial discrimination. Black people have been involved with the Latter Day Saint movement since its inception in the 1830s. Their experiences have varied widely, depending on the denomination within Mormonism and the time of their involvement. From the mid-1800s to 1978, Mormonism&#x27;s largest denominationthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)barred Black women and men from participating in the ordinances of its temples necessary for the highest level of salvation, and excluded most men of Black African descent from ordination in the church&#x27;s lay, all-male priesthood. During that time the LDS Church also opposed interracial marriage, supported racial segregation in its communities and church schools, and taught that righteous Black people would be made white after death. The temple and priesthood racial restrictions were lifted by church leaders in 1978. In 2013, the LDS Church disavowed its previous teachings on race for the first time.

The priesthoods of most other Mormon denominations, such as the Bickertonite and Strangite churches, have always been open to members of all races. The same is true in Mormonism&#x27;s second-largest denomination, the Community of Christ (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or the RLDS), except for a few years in which Black people were barred from the priesthood. More conservative denominations, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB), and the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (TLC), continue to exclude Black people as of 2018.

The LDS Church&#x27;s views on Black people have alternated throughout its history. Early church leaders&#x27; views on Black slavery went from neutrality to abolitionism to a pro-slavery view. As early as 1844, church leaders taught that Black people&#x27;s spirits were less righteous in premortal life (before birth). Mormonism founder Joseph Smith and his successor as church president with the most followers, Brigham Young, both taught that the skin color of Black people was the result of the curses of Cain and Ham. During the 20th century, many LDS leaders opposed the civil rights movement. In recent decades, the church has condemned racism and increased its outreach efforts in Black communities. It is still accused of perpetuating implicit racism by not apologizing for, acknowledging, or adequately counteracting the effects of its past beliefs and discriminatory practices like segregation. Church leaders have worked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (the NAACP) since the 2010s, and have donated millions of dollars to Black organizations.

There are an estimated 400,000 to one million Black LDS Church members worldwide, and at least five LDS Church temples in Africa. Fourteen more temples are at some stage of development or construction on the continent, in addition to several temples among communities of the African diaspora such as the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The Community of Christ has congregations in twelve African nations, with membership increasing.

== Joseph Smith&#x27;s views ==


Joseph Smith&#x27;s views on Black people varied during his lifetime. As founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Smith included Black people in many ordinances and priesthood ordinations but had differing views on racial segregation and the curses of Cain and Ham. He shifted his views on slavery several times, eventually taking an anti-slavery stance later in life.

===On slavery===

Smith initially expressed opposition to slavery, but avoided discussion of the topic after the church was formally organized in 1830. During the Missouri years, he tried to maintain peace with the members&#x27; pro-slavery neighbors; in 1835, the church declared it was not &quot;right to interfere with bond-servants, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters&quot; or cause &quot;them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life.&quot; Smith published an essay sympathetic to slavery the following year, arguing against a possible &quot;race war&quot;, providing justification for slavery based on the biblical curse of Ham, and saying that northerners had no &quot;more right to say that the South shall not hold slaves, than the South have to say that the North shall.&quot; During the Nauvoo settlement, Smith began preaching abolitionism and equality of the races. He called for &quot;the break down [of] slavery&quot; during his 1844 presidential campaign, and wanted to free all enslaved persons by 1850.

===On temple and priesthood access===
Smith was apparently present at the priesthood ordination of Elijah Abel, a multi-ethnic man with partial Black heritage, to the offices of elder and the seventy and permitted the ordination of several Black men into the priesthood of the early church. Although Abel received his washing and anointing temple ordinance under Smith, he did not receive the temple endowments; his petition for them was denied over thirty years later, and there is no record of any Black individuals receiving the Nauvoo endowment. After Smith&#x27;s death, Brigham Young barred Black people from temple endowments, marriage sealings, and the priesthood. There is no contemporary evidence suggesting that the anti-Black-priesthood restriction originated with Smith. 

===On equality and segregation===

Smith said that Black and white people would be better off if they were &quot;separate but legally equal&quot;, advocating segregation: &quot;Had I anything to do with the negro, I would confine them by strict law to their own species, and put them on a national equalization.&quot; He also said, &quot;They have souls, and are subjects of salvation. Go into Cincinnati or any city, and find an educated negro, who rides in his carriage, and you will see a man who has risen by the powers of his own mind to his exalted state of respectability.&quot;

==LDS policies and teachings==

===Premortal life===
After Smith&#x27;s death in 1844 and a six-month succession crisis, his most popular successor was Brigham Young; the Brighamite branch of Mormonism became the LDS Church. By that year, LDS leaders justified discriminatory policies with the belief that the spirits of Black individuals before earthly life were &quot;fence sitters&quot; between God and the devil and were less virtuous than white souls. Young rejected this explanation, but apostles Orson Pratt, Orson Hyde, and John Taylor supported the concept and it was accepted widely by LDS members. A century later, in a 1949 statement, the First Presidency (the church&#x27;s highest governing body) said that Black people were not entitled to the full blessings of the gospel and cited previous revelations on preexistence as justification. After the temple and priesthood ban was reversed in 1978, church leaders refuted the belief that Black people were less valiant in pre-existence. The church disavowed its previous teachings on race for the first time in 2013, denouncing any justification for the temple and priesthood restrictions based on premortality.

===Curses of Cain and Ham===


Teachings about the curse of Cain, the curse of Ham, and their relation to Black people have changed during the church&#x27;s history. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young called the curse of Ham a justification for Black enslavement. Smith believed that dark skin marked people of Black African ancestry as cursed by God. In his revisions of the King James Bible and production of the Book of Abraham, he traced their state back to the curses placed on Cain and Ham and linked the curses in the Book of Abraham by positioning Ham&#x27;s Canaanite-cursed posterity as matrilinear descendants of the previously-cursed Cain.

Under Smith&#x27;s leadership, Brigham Young seemed open to Black people holding the priesthood. As Smith&#x27;s successor, he used the biblical curses as justification for barring Black men from the priesthood, banning interracial marriages, and opposing Black voting rights. Young said that God&#x27;s curse on Black people would someday be lifted, and they would be able to receive the priesthood after death.

According to the Bible, God cursed Adam&#x27;s son Cain and put a mark on him after Cain killed Abel; the text does not specify the nature of the mark. Smith&#x27;s canonical scripture, the Pearl of Great Price, described the mark of Cain as dark skin; as church president, Young said: &quot;What is the mark [of Cain]? You will see it on the countenance of every African you ever did see&quot;. In another biblical account, Adam&#x27;s eighth great-grandson Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent. Because of this, Noah cursed his grandson Canaan (Ham&#x27;s son) as &quot;servants of servants&quot;. Although LDS scriptures do not mention the skin color of Ham or that of his son, Canaan, some church teachings associated the Hamitic curse with Black people and used it to justify their enslavement.

In 1978, when the church ended the temple and priesthood bans, apostle Bruce R. McConkie taught that the ancient curses of Cain and Ham were no longer in effect. Church leaders disavowed the idea that black skin was the sign of a curse for the first time in 2013.

===Patriarchal blessings===
In the LDS Church, patriarchal blessings are given to members. A blessing describes a member&#x27;s biblical lineage in a tribe of Israel, states their strengths and weaknesses, and advises the future. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, members were more likely to believe that they were descended from a tribe of Israel. Black members of the early LDS church sometimes received no lineage, or received one from a non-Israelite lineage of Ham. After the 1978 revelation, patriarchs sometimes did not declare lineages for Black members; since then, some Black members have requested (and received) a patriarchal blessing which includes a lineage.

===Righteous Black people will become white===
Early church leaders taught that after death and resurrection everyone in the celestial kingdom (the highest tier of heaven) would be &quot;white in eternity.&quot; They often equated whiteness with righteousness, and taught that God made his children white in his own image. Smith reported that in his vision, Jesus had a &quot;white complexion&quot; and &quot;blue eyes&quot;a description confirmed in another reported vision by follower Anson Call. A 1959 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that most Utah Mormons believed that &quot;by righteous living, the dark-skinned races may again become white and delightsome.&quot; The church also taught that the skin of white apostates would darken, and in the temple endowment ceremony (until at least the 1960s) Satan was said to have black skin.

Several Black Mormons were told that they would become white. Hyrum Smith told Jane Manning James that God could give her a new lineage, and promised her in his patriarchal blessing that she would become &quot;white and delightsome&quot;. In 1836, Elijah Abel was similarly promised that he would &quot;be made ... white in eternity&quot;. Darius Gray, a prominent Black Mormon, was told that his skin color would lighten. In 1978, apostle LeGrand Richards said that the curse of dark skin for wickedness and the promise of white skin through righteousness applied only to Native Americans, and not to Black people.

The LDS Church published a 2013 essay refuting these ideas, describing prior church teachings justifying the restriction as racial &quot;folk beliefs&quot;. It said that Blackness in Latter-day Saint theology is a symbol of disobedience to God, and not necessarily a skin color. A Sunday School teacher was removed from their position for teaching from this essay in 2015.

=== Slavery ===


Initial Mormon converts were from the North and opposed slavery, which caused contention in the slave state of Missouri. The church leadership then began distancing itself from abolitionism, sometimes justifying slavery with Biblical teachings. Several white people who enslaved Black people joined the church and brought their enslaved people when they moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, and the church discouraged influencing enslaved people to be &quot;dissatisfied with their condition&quot;. Contention between the mostly-abolitionist Latter-day Saints and slave-owning Southerners led to the Mormon expulsion from Jackson County, Missouri, in the 1838 Mormon War.

Joseph Smith began his presidential campaign on a platform of the government buying enslaved people into freedom over several years. He called for &quot;the break down of slavery&quot; and the removal of &quot;the shackles from the poor black man&quot;.

After Smith&#x27;s murder in 1844, most Latter-day Saints followed Young to Utah (part of the Mexican province of Alta California until 1848) in 1847. Some enslaved people were brought to Utah, although others escaped. Brigham Young began teaching that enslaving people was ordained by God, but remained opposed to creating a slave-based economy in Utah.

The Utah Territory, under Young&#x27;s governance, legalized the purchase of Black and Native American people for enslavement in 1852. Later that year Young congratulated the legislature stating the legislation had the desired effect and &quot;nearly freed the territory of the colored population.&quot; Under Young, Utah passed laws supporting slavery and forbidding Black people from voting, holding public office, joining the local military, or marrying white people. Utah&#x27;s slavery laws contrasted with those of the Southern states in permitting an enslavement closer to indentured servitude than to the South&#x27;s plantation slavery. Twenty-six Black people were enslaved in the Utah Territory, according to the 1850 census, and twenty-nine were reported in the 1860 census. Similar to other territories, one objective of the slavery laws was to prevent Black people from settling in Utah and control those already there.

Many prominent church members enslaved people, including William H. Hooper, Abraham O. Smoot, Charles C. Rich, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball. Members bought and sold people, gave the church enslaved people as a tithe, and recaptured those who escaped their enslavers. In California, Black enslavement was illegally tolerated in the Mormon community of San Bernardino despite California laws banning the practice. After the Civil War, the US government freed enslaved people and allowed many Black adults to vote. By the early 1920s, there were hundreds of members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in Utah. Although Church leaders opposed the KKK, several LDS members were Klan members.

=== Civil rights ===
After the Civil War, little changed on church stances towards Black people and their rights until the civil rights movement. The NAACP criticized the church&#x27;s position on civil rights, led anti-discrimination marches and filed a lawsuit against the church in response to its practice of not allowing Black children to be Boy Scout troop leaders. Students from other schools protested against BYU&#x27;s discriminatory practices and the church&#x27;s racial restrictions. The church issued a statement supporting civil rights, and changed its Boy Scout leader policy. The apostle Ezra Taft Benson criticized the civil rights movement and challenged accusations of police brutality. Black athletes protested against BYU&#x27;s discriminatory practices by refusing to play against the school&#x27;s teams. After the reversal of the temple and priesthood ban in 1978, LDS leaders were relatively silent about civil rights and eventually formed a partnership with the NAACP.

In 2017, local church leaders in Mississippi and the NAACP began to work on projects to restore the NAACP office where Medgar Evers had worked. The following year, it was announced that the church and the NAACP would begin a joint program for the financial education of East Coast residents in Baltimore, Atlanta and Camden, New Jersey. In 2019, church president Russell M. Nelson spoke at the national convention of the NAACP in Detroit. In June 2020, a spokesperson for the NAACP said there was &quot;no willingness on the part of the church to do anything material ... It&#x27;s time now for more than sweet talk.&quot;

In the church&#x27;s October 2020 general conference, leaders denounced racism and called on church members to take action against it. Nelson asked church members to &quot;lead out in abandoning attitudes and actions of prejudice.&quot; That month, in a speech at BYU, apostle Dallin H. Oaks denounced racism, endorsed the message that &quot;Black lives matter&quot; (discouraging its use to advance controversial proposals), and called on church members to root out racist attitudes, behavior and policies.

=== Segregation ===
During the first century of its existence, the church discouraged social interaction or marriage with Black people and encouraged racial segregation in its congregations, facilities, and university, in medical blood supplies, and in public schools. Joseph Smith supported segregation, saying: &quot;I would confine them [Black people] by strict law to their own species&quot;. Until 1963, many church leaders supported legalized racial segregation; David O. McKay, J. Reuben Clark, Henry D. Moyle, Ezra Taft Benson, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Mark E. Petersen were leading proponents.

Black families were told by church leadership not to attend church, or chose not to attend after white members complained. The church advocated for segregation laws and enforced segregation at its facilities, such as the Hotel Utah and Tabernacle performances. Church leaders advised members to buy homes so Black people would not move next to LDS chapels. In 1954, apostle Mark E. Petersen taught that segregation was inspired by God. Leaders advocated for the segregation of donated blood, concerned that giving white members blood from Black people might disqualify them from the priesthood. Church leaders opposed desegregation in public schools and at BYU.

===Interracial marriage===
Nearly every decade for over a century, from the church&#x27;s formation in the 1830s until the 1970s, saw denunciations of interracial marriage; most focused on Black–white marriages. The church&#x27;s stance against interracial marriage was consistent for over a century, while attitudes towards Black people and the priesthood and equal rights changed. Church leaders&#x27; views stemmed from the temple and priesthood policies and racist &quot;biological and social&quot; principles of the time.

Under Smith&#x27;s leadership in Nauvoo, it was illegal for Black men to marry white women; he fined two Black men for violating his prohibition. On at least three occasions (1847, 1852, and 1865), Brigham Young taught that the punishment for Black–white marriages was death; the killing of a Black–white couple and their children was part of a blood atonement which would be a blessing to them. Young also said that if the church approved of white intermarriage with Black people, it would be destroyed and the priesthood would be taken away.

Until (at least) the 1960s, the church penalized white members who married Black people by prohibiting both from entering temples. The temple and priesthood bans were lifted in 1978, but the church still discouraged marriage across ethnic lines. Until 2013, at least one official church manual continued to encouraging members to marry within their race.

==LDS Temple and priesthood restriction==

Although a few Black men were ordained to the priesthood under Smith before his death in 1844, from 1849 to 1978 the Brighamite LDS Church prohibited anyone with real (or suspected) Black ancestry from taking part in ordinances in its temples, serving in significant church callings, serving missions, attending priesthood meetings, being ordained to a priesthood office, speaking at firesides, or receiving a lineage in a patriarchal blessing. Non-Black spouses of Black people were also prohibited from entering temples. Because temple ordinances are considered essential to enter the highest degree of heaven, the exclusion meant that Black people were banned from exaltation. The ban was gradually relaxed so Black people could attend priesthood meetings and some people with &quot;questionable lineage&quot; were given the priesthood, such as Fijians, Indigenous Australians, Egyptians, and Brazilians and South Africans with unknown heritage who did not appear to have Black heritage. In 1978, the church&#x27;s First Presidency released Official Declaration 2, lifting the racial restrictions, in 1978; it was later adopted as scripture.

During more than 120 years of restrictions, the church said that they were instituted by God and offered several race-based explanations, including the belief that Cain and his descendants are cursed, that Ham&#x27;s marriage to Egyptus put a curse on Canaan&#x27;s descendants, and Black people were less valiant in their premortal life. Leaders used LDS scriptures to justify the explanations, including the Book of Abraham (which teaches that the descendants of Canaan were Black, and Pharaoh could not have the priesthood because he was one of Canaan&#x27;s descendants). Since 2013, the previous explanations are no longer accepted as church teachings and the church teaches anti-racism.

===History===

During the early years of the Latter Day Saint movement, at least two Black men became priests: Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis. Abel received the priesthood office of elder and the office of seventy, evidently in Smith&#x27;s presence. Historians Armand Mauss and Lester E. Bush Jr. found that statements about Smith&#x27;s support of the ban were the result of reconciliation attempts by later church leaders after his death to square the differing policies of Smith and Brigham Young. Sources suggest several other Black priesthood-holders in the early church, including Peter Kerr and Jamaican immigrant Joseph T. Ball. Other prominent Black members of the early church included Jane Manning James, Green Flake, and Samuel D. Chambers.

After Smith&#x27;s death in 1844 and a six-month succession crisis, Young became leader of most of Smith&#x27;s adherents and led the Mormon pioneers to what would become the Utah Territory. Like many American leaders at the time, Young promoted discriminatory views about Black people when he was territorial governor. In 1852, Young told the Utah Territorial Legislature that &quot;any man having one drop of the seed of [Cain] ... in him [could not] hold the priesthood.&quot;

===Doctrine vs. policy===

Church leaders taught for over a century that the priesthood-ordination and temple-ordinance bans were commanded by God; according to Young, it was a &quot;true eternal principle the Lord Almighty has ordained.&quot; In 1949, the First Presidency under George Albert Smith released a statement that the restriction &quot;remains as it has always stood&quot; and was &quot;not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord&quot;. A second First Presidency statement twenty years later, under David O. McKay, re-emphasized that the &quot;seeming discrimination by the Church towards the Negro is not something which originated with man; but goes back into the beginning with God&quot;. Church president Spencer W. Kimball said in 1973 that the ban was &quot;not my policy or the Church&#x27;s policy. It is the policy of the Lord who has established it.&quot;

About doctrine versus policy removing racial restrictions, apostle Dallin H. Oaks said in 1988: &quot;I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s possible to distinguish between policy and doctrine in a church that believes in continuing revelation and sustains its leader as a prophet ... I&#x27;m not sure I could justify the difference in doctrine and policy in the fact that before 1978 a person could not hold the priesthood and after 1978 they could hold the priesthood.&quot; Research by historians Armand Mauss, Newell G. Bringhurst, and Lester E. Bush has weakened the idea that the ban was doctrinal. Bush said that there was, in fact, no record of a revelation received by Young concerning the ban; justifications for Young&#x27;s policies were developed much later by church leaders and scholars.

===End of temple and priesthood bans===

The LDS church has adapted to environmental pressures throughout its history, including going from polygamy to monogamy, from political separatism to assimilation with the United States, and from communitarian socialism to corporate capitalism. On June 9, 1978, the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency released a declaration allowing &quot;all worthy male members of the church [to] be ordained to the priesthood without regard to race or color&quot;, which gave Black women and men access to temple endowments and sealings. It was the most significant church-policy change in decades. According to accounts by several present, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles received the revelation to remove the racial restrictions while they prayed in the Salt Lake Temple. Apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote that all present &quot;received the same message&quot;, and were able to understand &quot;the will of the Lord&quot;. Many factors led to the change, including pressure from the NAACP, growing membership and a temple in Brazil, pressures from member activists, negative publicity, and the need to resolve doctrinal contradictions. Due to the publicity from Lester Bush&#x27;s seminal article &quot;Mormonism&#x27;s Negro Doctrine&quot; in 1973, BYU vice-president Robert Thomas feared that the church would lose its tax-exempt status. The article detailed the church&#x27;s racially-discriminatory practices and inspired discussion among church leaders, weakening the idea that the temple and priesthood bans were doctrinal.

===Teachings about restrictions after 1978===

The 1978 announcement of the removal of racial restrictions did not give a reason for their removal, renounce, apologize for, or replace them. Because the restrictions were not officially repudiated, their justification persisted in 2020. Apostle McConkie continued to teach until his death that Black people were descended from Cain and Ham, and their curse came from God. His book &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;, published by the church-owned Deseret Book Company, perpetuated racism through a number of editions until it went out of print in 2010. A church spokesperson told reporters in 2005 that despite doctrines continuing to circulate about why people are Black, church leaders saw no need for statements about the topic since 1978.

BYU professor Randy L. Bott said in 2012 that God denied the priesthood to Black men to protect them from the lowest rung of hell, since abusing the priesthood is a damnable sin. Bott compared the priesthood ban to a parent denying young children the keys to the family car: &quot;You couldn&#x27;t fall off the top of the ladder, because you weren&#x27;t on the top of the ladder. So, in reality the Black men and boys not having the priesthood was the greatest blessing God could give them.&quot; The church said that Bott&#x27;s views did not represent church doctrine or teachings, and BYU professors do not speak on behalf of the university. The following year, the church disavowed teachings that Black skin was a sign of a curse for the first time. As of 2019 the church has not apologized for its past racist teachings and policies around Black people.

In a landmark 2016 survey, almost two-thirds of 1,156 self-identified Latter-day Saints reported believing that the pre-1978 temple and priesthood ban was &quot;God&#x27;s will&quot;. Nonwhite church members were almost 10 percent more likely to believe that the ban was &quot;God&#x27;s will&quot; than white members.

In 2022, BYU professor and Young Men general presidency member Brad Wilcox was criticized for a speech in which he downplayed and dismissed concerns about the priesthood and temple ban. Although Wilcox issued two apologies, reporter Jana Riess wrote that his scornful tone and words indicated that he &quot;felt disdainful toward women&quot; and believed that &quot;God is a racist&quot;. Riess called his apologies &quot;not-quite-apologies&quot;, and said that they did not go far enough. Videos document at least two other instances of Wilcox making similar speeches. Historian W. Paul Reeve said about the controversy that church leaders had not clarified as of 2022 whether the original ban was divinely inspired or not, nor had they disavowed the racial restrictions, resulting in members like Wilcox making controversial statements.

==Member views and actions==
Some Mormons have held racist views, and exclusion from temple and priesthood rites was not the only discrimination against Black people; as mayor of Nauvoo, Joseph Smith barred them from holding office or joining the Nauvoo Legion military. Brigham Young taught that equality efforts were misguided, saying that those who fought for equality for Black people were trying to elevate them &quot;to an equality with those whom Nature and Nature&#x27;s God has indicated to be their masters, their superiors&quot;.

A 1959 nationwide report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that Black people experienced widespread inequality in Utah, and Mormon teachings were used to justify racist treatment. During the 1960s and 1970s, Mormons in the western United States were near the nationwide average in racial attitudes. American racial attitudes caused difficulties when the church tried to apply its one-drop rule to other ethnically-diverse areas such as Brazil; many Brazilian members did not understand American classifications of race and how they applied to the temple and priesthood ban, causing a rift between missionaries and members.

Anti-Black jokes commonly circulated among Mormons before the 1978 revelation. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball began preaching against racism by the early 1970s, calling intolerance by church members &quot;despicable&quot;. According to a 1972–1996 study, church members in the United States were shown to have lower rates of approval of segregation than other U.S. groups and a faster decline in approval of segregation.

The church actively opposes racism among its membership, is working to reach out to Black communities, and hosts several predominantly-Black wards in the United States. In 2017, the LDS Church released a statement condemning racism in response to the white-nationalist Unite the Right rally in Virginia. One alt-right church member and blogger called the statement non-binding, since it came from the public-relations department rather than the First Presidency.

===White opposition to race-based policies===
During the second half of the 20th century, some white church members protested against teachings and policies excluding Black members from temple ordinances and the priesthood; three members were excommunicated in the 1970s for publicly criticizing these teachings. Other white members who publicly opposed some church teachings and policies concerning Black people were denied access to the temple. Politician Stewart Udall wrote a strongly-worded public letter in 1967 criticizing the church&#x27;s racial restrictions. His letter received hundreds of critical responses, including letters from apostles Delbert Stapley and Spencer Kimball.

===Racial discrimination after 1978 ban repeal===

LDS historian Wayne J. Embry interviewed several Black church members in 1987, and reported that all the participants reported &quot;incidents of aloofness on the part of white members, a reluctance or a refusal to shake hands with them or sit by them, and racist comments made to them.&quot; Embry said that one Black woman attended church for three years, despite being ignored by fellow congregants; &quot;she had to write directly to the president of the LDS Church to find out how to be baptized&quot;, because none of the other congregants would tell her.

Racism in the church continued after proclamations from church leadership extolling diversity and the 1978 end of the temple and priesthood bans. White church member and BYU professor Eugene England wrote in 1998 that most Mormons still held racist beliefs, including the belief that Black people were descended from Cain and Ham and subject to their curses. England&#x27;s students at BYU who reported holding these beliefs said that they had learned them from their parents or from instructors at church, and did not know they contradicted current church teachings. Black church member Darron Smith noticed a similar problem in 2003, and wrote in &quot;Sunstone&quot; about the persistence of racist beliefs. Smith wrote that racism persisted because church leadership had not addressed the ban&#x27;s origins: the beliefs that Black people were descendants of Cain, that they were neutral in the war in heaven, and that skin color indicated righteousness. Journalist and church member Peggy Fletcher Stack wrote in 2007 that Black Mormons still felt separate from other church members because of their treatment by other members, which ranged from being called the &quot;n-word&quot; to smaller slights. The absence of Black people from church leadership also contributed to Black members&#x27; feelings of not belonging.

Alice Faulkner Burch, a leader of the LDS-sponsored Black organization Genesis Group, said in 2016 that Black members &quot;still need support to remain in the church—not for doctrinal reasons but for cultural reasons.&quot; Burch added that &quot;women are derided about our hair ... referred to in demeaning terms, our children mistreated, and callings withheld.&quot; When asked what Black women in the church wanted, she said that one woman had told her she wished &quot;to be able to attend church once without someone touching my hair.&quot;

A 2020 Sunday-school manual contained teachings about &quot;dark skin&quot; in the Book of Mormon being &quot;the sign of [a] curse&quot;; the &quot;curse was the withdrawal of the Spirit of the Lord&quot;. Public pressure led the church to change the manual&#x27;s digital version, which subsequently said that the nature and appearance of the mark of dark skin are not fully understood. A few days later, elder Gary E. Stevenson told a Martin Luther King Day gathering of the NAACP that he was &quot;saddened&quot; by the &quot;error&quot;, and the church was &quot;asking members to disregard the paragraph in the printed manual.&quot; BYU law professor Michalyn Steele, a Native American, later expressed concern about the church&#x27;s editorial practices and dismay that church educators continue to perpetuate racism.

In the summer of 2020, Nelson issued a joint statement with three NAACP leaders condemning racism and calling for all institutions to work to eliminate lingering racism. At the October 2020 general conference, Nelson, first counselor Dallin H. Oaks, and apostle Quentin L. Cook denounced racism in their speeches. According to a 2016 survey of self-identified Mormons, over 60 percent said that they know (37 percent) or believe (25.5 percent) that the priesthood and temple ban was God&#x27;s will; another 17 percent said that it might be true, and 22 percent said that they know (or believe) that it was not God&#x27;s will. A 2023 survey of over 1,000 former church members in the Mormon corridor found race issues in the church to be one of the top three reported reasons why they had disafilliated.

==Black membership==

The first statement about proselytizing Black people concerned enslaved individuals. In 1835, church policy was to not proselytize Black people held in slavery unless they had permission from their enslavers. This policy was changed in 1836, when Smith wrote that enslaved people should not be taught the gospel until their owners were converted. Although the church had an open membership policy, it avoided opening missions in areas with large Black populations, discouraged people with Black ancestry from investigating the church, advised members to avoid social interaction with Black people, and instructed Black members to segregate themselves when white members complained about having to worship with them. Relatively few Black people who joined the church retained active membership prior to 1978.

===Proselytism===

Bruce R. McConkie wrote in his 1966 &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;, the &quot;gospel message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to [Black people], although sometimes negroes search out the truth.&quot; Despite interest from several hundred Nigerians, proselytism was abandoned in Nigeria during the 1960s; after the Nigerian government delayed the church&#x27;s visa, apostles decided against proselyting there. In Africa, the only active missionaries were among white South Africans; Black South Africans who requested baptism were told that the church was not working among them. The church avoided missionary work with native Fijians until 1955, when it said that they were related to other Polynesian groups and not Black. In Brazil, LDS officials discouraged people with Black ancestry from investigating the church; before World War II, proselytism in that country was limited to white German-speaking immigrants. For a time, church headquarters had a group of full-time genealogists tasked with determining priesthood and temple eligibility. The church instituted a genealogy program to uncover Black ancestry, and a person&#x27;s church records were marked if any was found. In the 1970s, &quot;lineage lessons&quot; were added to determine if interested persons were eligible for being taught by missionaries. Restrictions on proselytizing to Black people were lifted in 1978, and missionaries began entering predominately-Black areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

===After 1978===

The church does not keep records of the racial makeup of its membership, but the worldwide number of 21st-century Black adherents has been estimated at 400,000, 500,000, over 700,000, and one million. Black people have been members of Mormon congregations since the church&#x27;s founding in the 1830s, but by 1964 its worldwide Black membership was small: an estimated 300 to 400 people. In 1970, the church-sanctioned Black Genesis Group was founded in Salt Lake City. Black membership has increased, especially in Africa. In 1990, Helvécio Martins became the first Black general authority of the LDS Church. A 2007 Pew Poll found that three percent of LDS respondents in the U.S. identified as Black.

The LDS Church announced plans to build a temple in Nairobi in April 2017, bringing the number of temples planned or built in Africa (outside South Africa) to six. That year, two Black South African men were called to serve as mission presidents. Philip Jenkins said in 2009 that growth of the church has been slower in Africa than that of other churches due to its white face (a result of the temple and priesthood ban) and the church&#x27;s refusal to accommodate local customs such as polygamy.

==Other Latter Day Saint group positions==

===Community of Christ===

Joseph Smith III, the son of Joseph Smith, founded the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1860 (now known as the Community of Christ). Smith was a vocal advocate of abolishing the slave trade and a supporter of Abraham Lincoln and Owen Lovejoy, an anti-slavery congressman from Illinois; he joined the Republican Party, and advocated its anti-slavery position. He rejected the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and said that he would assist people who tried to escape enslavement. However, Smith viewed white people as superior to Blacks and said that they must not &quot;sacrifice the dignity, honor and prestige that may be rightfully attached to the ruling races.&quot; The priesthood was not available to Black people between 1860 and 1865, and the first Black man was not ordained to the priesthood until 1893. The Community of Christ rejects the Pearl of Great Price. The church had congregations in twelve African nations in 2020, with Black African membership increasing despite the Western decline in membership.

===Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints===
Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) president Warren Jeffs has made several anti-Black public statements since 2002. These included saying that the devil brings evil to the earth through Black people, that Cain is the father of the Black race, that people with &quot;Negro blood&quot; are unworthy of the priesthood, that Black-white marriage is evil, and that marrying someone who has &quot;connections with a Negro&quot; would invoke a curse. Former members say that as of 2024 Jeffs continues to remotely lead the organization despite his imprisonment.

===Apostolic United Brethren===

The Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) is a Utah-based, Latter Day Saint, polygamous, fundamentalist group that broke away in 1929. In 2018, they continued to deny temple and priesthood rites to people with Black heritage and taught that Black people are &quot;Canaanites&quot; and under the curse of Cain. In 1978, when the LDS church removed its racial restrictions, from dozens to hundreds of families reportedly left it for the AUB.

===Bickertonite===

The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) was founded by William Bickerton, and received many Rigdonite followers from Sidney Rigdon&#x27;s branch of Mormonism. It has advocated full racial integration in all aspects of the church since its organization in 1862, and suspended an elder in 1905 for opposing the full integration of all races.

Historian Dale Morgan wrote in 1949, &quot;An interesting feature of the Church&#x27;s doctrine is that it discriminates in no way against ... members of other racial groups, who are fully admitted to all the privileges of the priesthood. It has taken a strong stand for human rights, and was, for example, uncompromisingly against the Ku Klux Klan during that organization&#x27;s period of ascendancy after the First World War.&quot;
At a time when institutional racial segregation or discrimination was common throughout the United States, two leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ were Black. The church had a mission in Nigeria.

===Strangite===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), founded by James Strang in 1844, welcomed Black people at a time when other factions denied them the priesthood and other benefits of membership. Strang ordained at least two Black men to his church&#x27;s priesthood during his lifetime. Although his ethnicity is unclear from the historical record, James T. Ball was identified as Black at least once and joined the Strangites in 1849.

===True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days===

The Manti, Utah-based True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days (TLC) branched off from the LDS church in 1990 and as of 2008, it adhered to teachings and practices which were similar to the teachings and practices which were historically adhered to by the LDS church, including the Black temple and priesthood ban, the belief that the skin color of apostates would darken, and the practice of polygamy. The TLC&#x27;s founder James D. Harmston taught his followers that the LDS Church&#x27;s leader Gordon Hinckley was Cain in a previous life.

<text>The Norwegian Military Academy (), in Oslo, educates officers of the Norwegian Army and serves as the King&#x27;s Royal Guard. The academy was established in 1750, and is the oldest institution for higher education in Norway.

== History ==
The Commander-in-Chief of the Norwegian armed forces, Hans Jacob Arnold Jensen, sent a request to the King of Denmark-Norway in 1750 to establish a school of mathematics in Christiania. The King determined, through the Royal Resolution of 16 December 1750, to establish The Free Mathematical School (). It was the first institution offering higher education in Norway, but it did not give any extensive military education. The students were recruited from the officer corps or from nobles in military service.

After a reorganization in 1804, the school became an officer school and an independent unit with its own command. From 1876 to 1880 a college degree was required to apply. The school was first established at 10 Tollbugata in Oslo. It was moved to St. Olavsplass in 1899 and in 1918 it was moved back to Tollbugata 10. In 1969, it was moved to Linderud, where it is currently located.

Between 1984 and 1995 Krigsskolen Gimlemoen in Kristiansand was also in operation. This was a 2-year degree (in addition to a one-year NCO/Sergeant schools, and at least one year service as an NCO as a requirement for admission). Students from KSG were awarded a commission as officers in the Army.

In 2003, the Military Academy was obligated to follow the Law of Universities and granted the right to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

== Application and selection ==
Applicants must be Norwegian citizens aged between 18 and 25, pass drafting, pass health requirements, pass minimum requirements on physical tests and have higher education entrance qualifications.

===Selection===
The applicants will first go through the Armed Forces’ admission and selection process at Camp Sessvollmoen, common for all higher education in the armed forces.

Appicants must pass a series of psychological and physical tests, medical examinations, and interviews. Those who pass the first part of the admission process must then complete a selection exercise.

The applicants who are best suited will be offered to start at the school.
== Organization and education ==
The academy is a part of the Norwegian Defence University College. The academy offers three courses:

* Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Military Studies with a specialisation in Leadership and Land Power.
* Bachelor in military studies with specialisation in leadership – Military Logistics.
* Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Military Studies with a specialisation in Leadership and Construction Technology.

== Training ==
During the courses, the cadets complete several field exercises to train leadership, tactics and decision-making.
== Traditions ==
The classes have a tradition of taking names from Norwegian officers, inspiring the cadets to follow in their paths. The Norwegian Military Academy performs ceremonial duties for the King of Norway. A parade is conducted every 16 December to celebrate the establishment of the academy. In addition, the academy conducts a parade on 8 May, to celebrate the Liberation Day or Veteran Day.

<doc id="431953" wikidata="Q1251751" url="?curid=431953" title="Doug Harvey (ice hockey)">
<text>Douglas Norman Harvey (December 19, 1924 – December 26, 1989) was a Canadian professional hockey defenceman. Widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders in National Hockey League (NHL) history, Harvey was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973 and was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history in 2017. Individually he won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the best defenceman seven times, and was named to the end of season NHL All-Star team as a First All-Star 10 times. He played in from 1947 until 1964, and from 1966 until 1969. Best known for playing with the Montreal Canadiens, Harvey also played for the New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, and St. Louis Blues, as well as several teams in the minor leagues. He also served as the player-coach of the Rangers for one season, and served a similar role for the minor-league Kansas City Blues. He was also a coach.

Born and raised in Montreal, Harvey played junior hockey for local teams. He joined the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War, and while he spent the bulk of his time with the naval hockey team, he did see active service defending merchant shipping. A standout athlete, Harvey also played Canadian football and baseball at this time, though he gave up on both sports to concentrate on hockey. Signed by the Canadiens he made the team in 1947, though initially he was criticized for his style of play. After a few years Harvey began to demonstrate his abilities, and became regarded as one of the top defenders in the NHL. Regarded as a team leader he was voted captain of the team in 1960, however he clashed with Canadiens management due to personal differences, which combined with his age led to him being traded to New York in 1961.

Harvey spent two years with the Rangers before the team felt he was no longer effective, and assigned him to their minor-league affiliate, and released him in 1963. Harvey would spend the next five years in the minor leagues, briefly playing for Detroit, before he joined the Blues during the 1968 playoffs. He spent one final year in the NHL with the Blues before retiring in 1969. Following his playing career Harvey served in coaching and scouting roles for a few years, but a serious alcohol problem developed during the latter stages of his career kept him from serving in any capacity for long. He reconciled with the Canadiens a few years before his death, having his #2 sweater retired, and served as a part-time scout for the team. With the Canadiens, Harvey won the Stanley Cup six times and played in the Stanley Cup Finals five more times.

==Early life==
Harvey was born in Montreal on December 19, 1924, the second child of Alfred and Martha Harvey. Alfred was born in Hammersmith, United Kingdom in 1896 and had moved to Canada with his parents in 1905, while Martha was born in Pennsylvania to Welsh immigrants. The family lived in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG), an English-speaking working-class neighbourhood of Montreal, where Alfred worked in the warehouse of N.C. Polson. Harvey was the second child, following Alfred Jr. (Alf) and preceding Howard and Mary.

As a child Harvey was physically active, playing in many sports, and was also known as a troublemaker, often getting into fights with neighbouring children. Outside of sports he delivered newspapers, with one of his customers being future Canadiens&#x27; teammate Bill Durnan. He first showed his athletic ability in Canadian football, and when he entered West Hill High School in 1939 he joined the team there, playing both on offence and defence. He also played for the West Hill hockey team, and it was there that he first began to demonstrate his skills as a hockey player. Harvey had played hockey from a young age, but only joined an organised league when he was 13, asked to join a team by Alf. Initially he played goaltender, owing to his small stature, but soon moved to centre. Only later would he switch to defence.

The Second World War was ongoing while Harvey was completing high school, and in 1942, one month before his 18th birthday, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy, following the advice of Alf, who had already done so. Recognized as a skilled hockey player, Harvey was initially assigned to the Navy&#x27;s hockey team, which was used to boost public morale. However Harvey wanted to properly serve in the war, so requested a transfer to active service, though this was not addressed until 1944. In the spring of 1944 Harvey was assigned to a defensively equipped merchant ship; this was again a suggestion of Alf, as it meant a less rigorous lifestyle on board a naval vessel. Harvey would spend the next year regularly crossing the Atlantic while helping protect supplies being shipped to Europe and Africa. Throughout this time Harvey&#x27;s ships were never fired upon, and he would later look back fondly on his service. It was also during this period that biographer William Brown believes Harvey began to develop an alcohol addiction; neither of his parents drank, which was in stark contrast to the naval service, though Brown concedes it was only later in life that it became a serious problem for Harvey.

==Amateur career==
===Minor league hockey===
Harvey played minor league hockey in Oxford Park, NDG, then began his professional career with the Montreal Royals of the Quebec Senior Hockey League where he played from 1945 to 1947, helping them win the Allan Cup. He then played one season with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. He made the jump to the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL in the 1947–48 NHL season and remained with the team until 1961.

===Football and baseball===
In the early 1940s Harvey also played rugby football (later known as Canadian football). He started to play competitively while at West Hill, and though he could play both offence and defence equally well, he was most known as a defensive halfback. He continued on with the sport when he joined the navy, playing for their Montreal-based team, St. Hyacinthe–Donnacona Navy. In 1942 Harvey was named the most valuable player of the Quebec Rugby Football Union. The Donnacona Navy won the 1944 Grey Cup as Canadian champions, though Harvey had been sent into active service and did not play in the game. After the war he briefly played for the newly formed Montreal Hornets, but a mid-season injury forced him out. Though skilled at football, Harvey gave up the sport as it was only semi-professional in Canada at that time, while hockey was fully professional.

Harvey also played baseball at a competitive level, spending summers on teams from 1947 to 1950, mainly playing as a third baseman. In 1947 he was invited to join the Ottawa Nationals, a team that was run by Tommy Gorman (who had recently left his position as general manager of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team) and competed in the Class C Border League. A skilled ball player, in 1949 Harvey led the Border League in runs, runs batted in, and batting average. He was also offered a contract by the major league Boston Braves, though turned down the offer as it would only see him play in Class B (another level in the minor leagues).

==Professional career==
===Montreal Canadiens===
Under coach Dick Irvin, Harvey was named to the All-Star team 11 consecutive times, beginning in the 1951–52 NHL season. He won his first of seven James Norris Memorial Trophies in 1955, as the league&#x27;s best defenceman. In an era when the defenceman&#x27;s role did not include scoring points, Harvey used his skating speed and passing ability to become a factor in making the Canadiens a high-scoring team.

He won the Stanley Cup six times, all with Montreal. During the 1954 Finals however, he scored a Cup-losing own-goal when he tried to block a shot by Tony Leswick of the Detroit Red Wings with his glove but instead tipped it past goalie Gerry McNeil. McNeil, who struggled with the pressure of being an NHL goalie, quit hockey for the following year.

Between 1955 and 1962 Harvey won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defenceman every year except 1959, when it went to his teammate Tom Johnson.

Prior to the 1960–61 season Harvey was voted captain of the Canadiens by his teammates. This was not welcomed by team management, who were not happy with Harvey&#x27;s actions on and off the ice.

Harvey was an outspoken critic of the hockey establishment who controlled players&#x27; careers via the reserve clause, which restricted player rights. In Harvey&#x27;s day, players were not highly paid, with Harvey earning less than $30,000 a season at the peak of his career.

===New York Rangers===

After the Canadiens lost in the 1961 playoffs, Harvey was singled out by Canadiens&#x27; general manager Frank J. Selke for the team&#x27;s poor performance, and began to look at ways to get rid of him. Though he was still considered one of the best players in the NHL, Selke and the Canadiens had tired of his antics, and soon were in discussions with the New York Rangers about a possible trade. Muzz Patrick, the coach and general manager of the Rangers, had tired of the dual role, and agreed to take on Harvey if he could be convinced to be a player-coach. While Harvey was reluctant to move to New York he agreed to talk to Patrick, who offered a two-year contract worth $25,000 per year, a fairly high salary. After initially refusing, he agreed after a third year was added to the contract.

Harvey again won the Norris Trophy in 1961–62, the first Ranger to do so. As coach, he tried to have the team play a similar style to what he had seen in Montreal, which helped the Rangers make the playoffs for the first time since 1958. Desiring to be closer to the players, which he felt was not possible as their coach, Harvey resigned as coach for the 1962–63 season, and was only convinced to remain with the Rangers when Patrick offered him a $30,000-per-year salary, reportedly the highest in NHL history to that point. Harvey&#x27;s play remained at a high level: he led all NHL defencemen in scoring with 39 points, but was criticized for the team&#x27;s lack of success. Harvey missed the Rangers&#x27; training camp prior to the start of the 1963–64 season, owing to issues with his restaurant, and when he returned was sent to the team&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the St. Paul Rangers of the Central Professional Hockey League, where he played 5 games before rejoining New York. After recording 2 assists in 14 games during the 1963–64 season, Harvey continued to attract negative attention, and rather than return to the minor leagues he asked to be released from his contract.

===Minor leagues===
After leaving the Rangers Harvey spent two years with the Quebec Aces of the AHL. He followed that with one and a half seasons with the Baltimore Clippers and a further half season with the Pittsburgh Hornets.

In 1964 Harvey, Gump Worsley, and Red Berenson played for the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in a game against the Soviet national team. Harvey played almost 50 minutes during the 3–2 loss.

===Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues===
In January 1967, Harvey was called up to play for the Detroit Red Wings in a back-to-back series against the Chicago Black Hawks. However he disappointed Red Wings management by showing up roughly overweight, and was largely ineffective in the two games, so was sent back to Pittsburgh for the remainder of the season. With the Hornets he won the Calder Cup, the AHL championship, though the team disbanded after the season as the Pittsburgh Penguins were due to start playing in the NHL for 1967–68. He finished his NHL career in 1969 with the St. Louis Blues. In addition, he was hired as coach and manager of the Kansas City Blues, which was the St. Louis Blues&#x27; minor league affiliate in 1967–68. Harvey served as player-coach during his first season in New York, but was never entirely comfortable with this dual role.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring from playing, Harvey became head coach of the Laval Saints of the newly formed Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. However he only coached 16 games before leaving the team, finishing with a record of 4 wins and 12 losses. Offered a role as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL he went there, serving out the rest of the season with the team. He was offered a chance to play for the team but declined as he was 45 at that point and had not played in over a year.

In 1973, Harvey was hired as an assistant coach and scout by the Houston Aeros of the upstart World Hockey Association. With the Aeros he helped sign former NHL star Gordie Howe and his two sons, Mark and Marty, which was considered a major coup for the new league. Though he had initially stayed sober with Houston, Harvey relapsed and was let go by the team at the end of the 1973–74 season.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Harvey married Ursula Hardie on May 21, 1949, in Montreal. It is not certain when they met, but they had been together since at least 1946. They had six children: Doug Jr., Darlene, Glen, Nancy, Diane, and Maria. The family lived in NDG throughout Harvey&#x27;s playing career, though they moved to Long Island during his first season with the Rangers before returning to Montreal after a few months, living in a house he built with his brothers in 1950. Harvey and Ursula would separate in 1980.

===Off-ice business===
Outside of hockey, Harvey had several business ventures. After building his own home, Harvey and his brothers began a housebuilding business in 1953, and they later established an aluminum window business as well. Harvey, who was well known for his hockey career at this point, would spend most of his time talking to clients, leaving Alf and Howard to do the physical work. In the early 1960s Harvey opened up a restaurant in Montreal, Chez Doug Harvey, with an associate he had recently met. The restaurant proved a massive financial failure, with his partner absconding with a large amount of money, and ultimately cost Harvey around $65,000, equal to nearly two years&#x27; pay for him. It also took a serious toll on his family&#x27;s finances, which were exacerbated when he played in the minor leagues, making far less than he had in the NHL; on several occasions friends would help cover the mortgage to prevent Harvey from defaulting.

Starting in the mid-1960s Harvey started a summer hockey school for young boys. He would lead a two-week school instructing them on how to play better, and would often buy equipment and board players who were unable to cover the associated costs. The school ran yearly until 1979. While in Ottawa in 1972 Harvey was arrested for having a concealed weapon without a permit, as he was trying to board a plane. He was given a 6-month suspended sentence, and the gun was confiscated. In the early 1980s Harvey was offered a job at the Connaught Park Racetrack in Aylmer, Quebec, living with and working for the family of NHL founder Tommy Gorman&#x27;s son, Joe Gorman, as well as the opportunity to live in retired railcar that had been used by Canadian prime minister John Diefenbaker in the 1950s, and subsequently purchased by the Gorman family. Doug accepted the position and lived with Gorman&#x27;s as a part of their family until his return to Montreal.

For years, Harvey battled alcoholism while suffering from bipolar disorder. In 1985 he was offered a job with the Montreal Canadiens as a scout. He died on December 26, 1989, due to cirrhosis of the liver, a week after his 65th birthday, and was interred in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

==Playing style==
Prior to the start of Harvey&#x27;s career, it was normal for defencemen to pass the puck off to forwards or dump it into the offensive zone; the goal was to quickly move it out of the defensive zone and limit chances for the opponent to set up plays. Harvey was not interested in this system, and preferred to keep control of the puck as long as he could. In this way Harvey felt he could control the tempo of the play, and felt that by quickly dumping the puck it only turned over possession to the opponent. He would then pass the puck to a teammate who would quickly enter the offensive zone and set up scoring chances that way. This style of play was unusual at the time and Harvey was perceived as being a lazy player by both Canadiens&#x27; fans and his coaches. That Harvey, who was roughly and during his playing career, had a stocky look did not help this perception. However once it became apparent what he was doing he earned recognition for his ability.

Harvey&#x27;s ability to set up offense helped the Canadiens create one of the strongest offensive teams in NHL history. Though he did not score many goals during his career, Harvey helped others score, and recorded several seasons with high assist totals. With this Harvey led NHL defencemen in assists five times and scoring three times during his career. Indeed, the Canadiens of the late 1950s were so strong on the power play that they repeatedly could score multiple goals on one power play. Other teams began to resent this, and so at the end of the 1955–56 season the NHL adopted a rule that ended a power play after one goal was scored.

==Legacy==
From early on in his playing career Harvey was recognized as one of the top defencemen in NHL history, and one of the best players in general. With seven Norris Trophy wins he is tied with Nicklas Lidström for second most all-time, behind Bobby Orr&#x27;s eight. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973, though he had been eligible since 1972. It was said that the one-year delay was because of Harvey&#x27;s lifestyle, and that he was asked to clean himself up if he wanted to be elected. Harvey apparently took this as a slight, and refused to attend his own induction ceremony in 1973, and reportedly went fishing instead.

Prior to a game on October 26, 1985, the Montreal Canadiens retired Harvey&#x27;s number 2. In 1991, the Confederation Arena in NDG was renamed the &quot;Doug Harvey Arena&quot;. Efforts had been made to rename the arena prior to Harvey&#x27;s death, but Montreal rarely renamed arenas after still-living people. &quot;The Hockey News&quot;, the premier hockey magazine, released a list of the top 100 NHL players of all time in 1997, with Harvey named sixth overall. He was also named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in 2017.

==NHL coaching record==

Harvey has the distinction of being the NHL&#x27;s last-ever player-coach. He held the dual roles with the New York Rangers during the 1961–62 season—a year in which he led the team to the semi-finals and was awarded his seventh Norris Trophy for best defenceman in the league. He again served as a player-coach for the Kansas City Blues of the Central Professional Hockey League in 1967.

<text>The Staten Island Greenbelt is a system of contiguous public parkland and natural areas in the central hills of the New York City borough of Staten Island. It is the second largest component of the parks owned by the government of New York City and is maintained by the city&#x27;s Department of Parks and Recreation and the Greenbelt Conservancy, a not-for-profit organization that works in partnership with NYC Parks to care for the Greenbelt and raise funds for its maintenance and programs. The Greenbelt includes High Rock Park, LaTourette Park, William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge, and Willowbrook Park among others.

==Description==

The administrative headquarters of the Greenbelt and Greenbelt Conservancy are located at the entrance to High Rock Park (one of the many parks within the system) with a street address of 200 Nevada Avenue in the Egbertville neighborhood; in June 2004 a second facility, known as the Greenbelt Nature Center, was opened approximately away, at 700 Rockland Avenue. The Greenbelt Conservancy, which works in partnership with the NYC Parks Department, is a membership organization offering year-round nature-themed events for people of all ages.

The Protectors of Pine Oak Woods, a citizen organization committed to the conservation and preservation of remaining natural area on Staten Island has, since the early 1970s, carried on the mission of its predecessor, SIGNAL. Today the &quot;Protectors&quot; continue the tradition of organizing people concerned about the island&#x27;s fragile and threatened wilderness via lobbying and naturalist led hikes.

A researchable archive of planning, legal, public relations, and other documents related to the Staten Island Greenbelt, its ecology and history, is housed at the library of the College of Staten Island, a campus of the City University of New York.

===Geology===
Containing an extensive system of connected trails and covering , its forested hills run the length of Staten Island&#x27;s midsection while wetlands and kettle ponds fill much of the low-lying areas. Four hundred and ten feet above sea level, Todt Hill is the highest elevation south of Maine along the Eastern Seaboard. This and other surface features are the result of glacial activity from the Pleistocene epoch; the metamorphic and igneous rocks below the surface – schist, sandstone, serpentine, magnetite, iron oxide – are the result of tectonic activity from the much earlier Paleozoic era and volcanic activity from subsequent geologic eras.

===Wildlife===
The Greenbelt is one of the most biologically diverse places in New York City. It is home to several species of amphibians; such as the eastern redback salamander, the green frog, the American bullfrog, and the grey tree frog; reptiles; such as the eastern garter snake, the eastern box turtle, and the northern water snake, as well as New York&#x27;s state reptile, the common snapping turtle. On occasion northern &quot;black&quot; racer and eastern milksnakes are reported here. Both species are threatened elsewhere on Staten Island due to habitat destruction due to development. The Greenbelt provides year-round habitat native mammals like the gray squirrel, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the white-tailed deer. Permanent bird residents include the blue jay, northern cardinal, downy woodpecker, and black-capped chickadee, while northern flickers and other migrants use the Greenbelt as a stopover on seasonal migration routes. Raptors such as Cooper&#x27;s hawks, redtail hawks, and great horned owls also call the greenbelt home. The waterways are rich in fish life, and such species found here include the largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish, brown bullhead, black crappie, yellow perch, chain pickerel, as well as several darter species.

==Early settlement==

The native Lenni-Lenape, who inhabited the island centuries before the arrival of the Dutch, reportedly dubbed Staten Island Aquehonga Monocknong or &quot;the place of bad woods&quot; perhaps because of the spirits they believed dwelled there. Then, as today, the boulder-littered moraines were covered with many species of trees: oak, hickory, maple, beech, as well as lesser quantities of birch, sweet gum, ash, black walnut, wild cherry, and tulip. Below the canopy of this sub-climax forest grew dogwood, ironwood, spicebush, blackberry, wild grape, Virginia creeper, and sassafras, along with royal and cinnamon ferns, skunk cabbage, lady slipper, and trout lilies in the wetter areas.

Within the oak-mulch enriched soil that has been laid down over millennia, arrowheads have been found. These finds attest to both the Leni-Lenape&#x27;s subsistence on and unsuccessful defense of their home, which contained the natural resources that made it so attractive to first Dutch and then British colonizers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its forested hills, strategically located between and above the Raritan Bay and the New York Harbor, offered timber for ship building, iron ore for the production of cannonballs, and a staging ground for British troops during the War for Independence.

In the 1800s, several centuries after European settlers had come to, named, deforested, and farmed large portions of Staten Island, travelers of a different sort arrived. Henry David Thoreau - in his furthest journey from his native Massachusetts – came for one year in 1843 in order to tutor the nephews of his friend and fellow transcendentalist, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some years later, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, famed for his design of urban parks throughout the U.S., settled for a time on a experimental farm overlooking the Raritan Bay, which he called Tosomock Farm. After 10 years, he and his new bride left the island only to return later in his life. After Olmsted left Tosomock Farm, businessman Erastus Wiman bought it, renaming it &quot;The Woods of Arden&quot;, which stands today at 4515 Hylan Boulevard, near Woods of Arden.

==Proposal for a park==
In 1871, in his capacity as consultant to the Staten Island Improvement Commission, Olmsted made the following proposal for Staten Island:

Other proposals on behalf of preserving wilderness on Staten Island were put forward in subsequent years. William T. Davis, a naturalist born on the island, believed:

When Davis, along with local historian Charles Leng, coauthored a history of Staten Island in 1896, they wrote:

Just one year later, at an 1897 public hearing on the topic of land preservation in Albany, the state&#x27;s capital, Staten Island resident Erastus Wiman stated:

==Parkway plan==

===Original plan===
During the first half of the 20th century, several proposals for Staten Island parks and parkways were drafted first by the Borough of Staten Island and then by the City of New York. During the early 1960s, though then-Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman Robert Moses revealed plans for what is now the Korean War Veterans Parkway, a parkway that would connect Brooklyn with New Jersey, traversing the island from the soon to be opened Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on the island&#x27;s North Shore to the Outerbridge Crossing on the southern shore of Staten Island. This original route of the proposed &quot;Richmond Parkway&quot; would have bisected the swath of land on whose behalf Olmsted had pleaded including what is today Fresh Kills, William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge, Reed&#x27;s Basket Willow Swamp, Willowbrook and High Rock Park.

The parkway route going through the area has been de-mapped despite occasional proposals for its revival due to steadily increasing highway congestion on Staten Island. None of these proposals, however, have received any significant support from either the island&#x27;s elected officials or residents. The parkway ends at the Greenbelt&#x27;s southwestern edge, at Richmond Avenue and Arthur Kill Road, near the Fresh Kills Park.

===Opposition===
Conservation activists, given immediacy by the Federal Highway Act and hope in the person of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, mobilized in opposition to these plans. They first saved High Rock Girl Scout Camp, the acreage of which had originally been a part of Pouch Boy Scout Camp, including Orbach Lake, to the north. With a $35,000 grant from the State of New York it was bought from the Boy Scouts and established as Camp High Rock for Girls. For thirteen years, the camp served girl scouts from throughout the five boroughs of New York City. However, in 1964, the Girl scout Council of Greater New York secretly decided to sell the camp to a developer for $1 million. Upon learning about this sale, the New York City Parks Department and the State of New York, with the help of the Open Lands Foundation, raised over $1.3 million to buy back the land from the developer, thus creating High Rock Park.

Then, on November 22, 1965, the Staten Island Citizens Planning Committee (SICPC), which had begun in 1954 as an ad hoc committee of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Staten Island, issued the first of many position papers beginning by invoking Olmsted&#x27;s plea for a linear park; it concluded by presenting an alternate parkway plan that would spare what has come to be known as the Staten Island Greenbelt, a term proposed by landscape architect, Bradford Greene, one of the group&#x27;s founding members. Greene was familiar with this policy or land use designation from previous work he had been involved with in Maryland. At the helm of the SICPC, an all-volunteer organization, were several &quot;off-islanders&quot; – young professionals who had moved to Staten Island&#x27;s North Shore area in the 1950s largely because of the quality of life promised by the open space that still existed. In addition to Bradford Greene, there were Terrence Benbow and Frank Duffy, both attorneys practicing in Manhattan; Robert Hagenhofer, a graphic designer; George Pratt, director of the Staten Island Institute of Arts &amp; Sciences; and &quot;New York Times&quot; staff writer Alan Oser. Summoning their many and diverse talents, their strategy involved developing and advocating for an alternate route in the press, before public officials, and, when necessary, the courts.

One year into the SICPC&#x27;s legal fight against the original route of the Richmond Parkway, the Staten Island Greenbelt Natural Areas League (SIGNAL), spearheaded by another resident-journalist, John G. Mitchell, formed as a vehicle for rallying community opposition to the highway construction. From 1966 until the early 1970s, SIGNAL organized thousands of citizens and elected officials (including Planning Commissioner Eleanor Guggenheimer, Parks Commissioner Thomas Hoving, Mayor John V. Lindsay, and U.S. Senator Jacob Javits) to participate in annual winter walks through the highland forests, tracing the route of the proposed (and already mapped) highway route. These two citizen organizations and their combined strategies of lobbying, public relations, and grassroots organizing challenged Robert Moses, who had been thwarted by community efforts only twice before: In 1956, mothers who frequented Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park with their young children successfully had stopped a proposed parking lot expansion by challenging Moses in court. Two years later, when Robert Moses proposed the construction of a sunken boulevard which would have sped traffic through the middle of the famed Washington Square Park, the Joint Committee to Stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway led by Jane Jacobs, defeated him again.

===Work continues===
In spite of opposition, road work began in 1965 on what became known as &quot;Section 1&quot;. In 1966 Volmer Associates were hired by the city of New York to describe alternate routes to Section 1. They were proposed, studied, and debated by New York state and city officials, creating contention and divisions even within these governmental units. While travel distance between the island&#x27;s bridges was on paramount concern to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the City Park Department, led by August Hecksher, commissioned the planning firm Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd. Ian McHarg, a Glasgow born landscape architect, who had stated in his much studied book Design with Nature that engineer road builders were &quot;gouging and scarring the landscape without remorse,&quot; headed up the landmark study.

Having pointed out that a method for displaying and factoring social values into highway design and planning had not been developed, McHarg set about creating just that. Long before GIS technology was available, McHarg used data rich maps and overlays which allowed planners to visually understand how social values – historic, residential, economic, recreational, scenic, ecological factors – synergistically interacted with and potentially impacted upon human activity, including road building. Using map transparencies he and his colleagues produced the commissioned report with a recommendation stating that the route to the west of what is today the Greenbelt, was the &quot;least social cost corridor.&quot;

Under duress from developers who were eager to begin building homes adjacent to the roadway, the Greenbelt&#x27;s erstwhile supporters, Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, publicly backed a compromise route. In response, the two citizen organizations were willing to stop at nothing to preserve what John Mitchell, in one of his writings, referred to as &quot;a fine patch of wild&quot;. With their combined memberships behind them, the officers of the SICPC and SIGNAL sought injunctive relief in New York State Supreme Court, which meant suing both Lindsay and Rockefeller. The court decision found for the plaintiffs. The citizen planners and conservationists were victorious. The area was earmarked as one of two Special Natural Features Districts in the City of New York, and between 1972 and 1974 the urbanist and architect Peter Verity (now of PDRc) prepared for the New York City Planning Commission the strategic and detailed documentation to support this designation.

===Remaining parts===
When the work was halted by the city, excavations were used to construct what was known as &quot;Moses Mountain&quot; and now &quot;Paulo&#x27;s Peak,&quot; a 200-foot rise and viewpoint adjacent to the Manor Road - Rockland Avenue interchange. Other remnants of construction can be seen from the Staten Island Expressway between the Clove Road and Bradley Avenue exits, which are referred to as the abandoned bridges. They are a little west of the Petrides School Complex. This abandoned interchange was removed as part of a $140 million overhaul of the Expressway.

==1980s expansion==
In 1982, of city-owned land, which heretofore had belonged to the New York City Farm Colony, were added to the Greenbelt; this tract is located on the north side of Rockland Avenue, from Brielle Avenue almost to Forest Hill Road. In 1984, the Staten Island Greenbelt was officially recognized by the city, becoming one of the largest natural areas within the five boroughs of New York City and the second largest park in the city, behind Pelham Bay Park.

<text>USS &quot;Dale&quot; (DLG-19/CG-19) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1963 to 1994. She was sunk as a target in 2000 off the East Coast of the United States near Maryland.

== History ==
&quot;Dale&quot; was named in honor of Commodore Richard Dale (1756–1826). She was built at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, USA and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 23 November 1963. Her sponsor was Mrs. Daniel J. Flood. Assigned to Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Force Pacific Fleet, she made five deployments to the Western Pacific over the next seven years. Between 1965 and 1970, &quot;Dale&quot;″s Seventh Fleet tours included participation in Vietnam War operations, during which she rescued several American aviators in the Gulf of Tonkin.

=== 1970s ===
On 10 November 1970 &quot;Dale&quot; was decommissioned and began modernization at Bath, Maine to increase flexibility in combat systems. This work fitted her with the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) and other improvements that enhanced her anti-air and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. When recommissioned on 11 December 1971, &quot;Dale&quot; was assigned to Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet and homeported in Newport, Rhode Island.

In &quot;Dale&quot;″s first Mediterranean deployment in June 1973, she participated in the multinational exercise &quot;Swift Move&quot; in northern European Waters, and helped augment the Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean during the tense period of U.S.-Soviet relations that accompanied the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.

In February 1974, &quot;Dale&quot; moved to her new homeport in Mayport, Florida. During 1974, &quot;Dale&quot; was selected as the operational platform for the newly deployed AN/SPS-49 two dimensional air search radar, which took &quot;Dale&quot; to the Caribbean several times during 1974 and early 1975.

&quot;Dale&quot; was reclassified as a guided-missile cruiser (CG-19) at the beginning of July 1975. In October 1975, &quot;Dale&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean, participating successfully in several national and multinational exercises and earning praise from Commander, Sixth Fleet and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe on her departure for home.

In July 1976, she helped represent the U.S. Navy during the Bicentennial Naval Review in New York Harbor. Then, &quot;Dale&quot; began a regular 12-month overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard which upgraded &quot;Dale&quot;″s NTDS and missile fire control systems. Upon the completion of the overhaul, the cruiser returned to Mayport.

In June 1978, &quot;Dale&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean, participating successfully in several national and multinational exercises returning home February 1979.

In September 1979, &quot;Dale&quot; deployed to the North Atlantic for two months to serve as the flagship for the Commander Striking Force Atlantic Fleet for the NATO exercise &quot;Ocean Safari.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
In January and February 1980, &quot;Dale&quot; participated in the Atlantic Fleet Readiness Exercise &quot;READEX 1-80.&quot; &quot;Dale&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in March 1980 and, as a unit of the Sixth Fleet, served as flagship for Commander-Destroyer Group Eight. A highlight of this deployment was entering the Black Sea to visit Constanța, Romania. &quot;Dale&quot; returned to Mayport in August 1980. The remainder of the year included two trips to the Caribbean for carrier support operations and participations in &quot;COMPUTEX/ASWEX 1-81.&quot;

&quot;Dale&quot; entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard in March 1981 to begin a Baseline Overhaul to update the ship&#x27;s combat weapons systems and overhaul major engineering equipment. During the overhaul, which &quot;Dale&quot; completed a month early in February 1982, the 3 inch/50 caliber gun mounts were replaced with Harpoon surface-to-surface guided missiles and the Phalanx gun system to the port and starboard sides. &quot;Dale&quot; completed Refresher Training in June 1982.
&quot;Dale&quot; deployed December 1982 to the Mediterranean. After port visits in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France and Athens, Greece, &quot;Dale&quot; transited the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean. While in the Indian Ocean the vessel made port visits to Karachi, Pakistan; Trincomalee, Sri Lanka; and, Mombasa, Kenya. As the guided missile cruiser was headed to Diego Garcia, she crossed the equator on 26 February 1983 and again on 12 April 1983–344 people became Shellbacks. On the morning of 27 April 1983, &quot;Dale&quot; was conducting tactical maneuvers with other ships of the U.S. and British fleets. During the course of the exercise, the British frigate collided with &quot;Dale&quot;″s port quarter. Resulting in serious damage to the Ambuscade&#x27;s bow and enough damage to have the &quot;Dale&quot; Dry docked when she returned to Jacksonville Florida. A team was flown in from USS America to help R and First Divisions make satisfactory repairs, enough to keep her seaworthy and to get her to the Mediterranean. Finishing touches would be completed while re-transiting the Suez Canal on her way to the Indian Ocean. &quot;Dale&quot; re-transited the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. The cruiser&#x27;s last port call was Málaga, Spain before heading back to United States of America in June 1983.

During the 1980s her Mediterranean tours were sometimes extended to take her into the increasingly important Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf regions. In 1986 she took part in the confrontation with Libya.

&quot;Dale&quot; received an extensive overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard which included the New Threat Upgrade combat systems enhancement. &quot;Dale&quot; entered the yard January 1987 and completed the overhaul June 1988. &quot;Dale&quot; deployed with the battle group to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean on 11 May 1989 and returned to Mayport 10 November 1989.

=== 1990s ===
&quot;Dale&quot; spent much of her final years of service on counter-narcotics patrols in the Caribbean area, and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as on regular cruises with the Sixth Fleet. During 1991 she went to the Red Sea to help enforce sanctions against Iraq after Operation Desert Storm. She had similar duties in 93, in support of United Nations&#x27; Resolutions concerning Bosnia and Yugoslavia.

== Fate ==
The USS Dale was decommissioned in September 1994, at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. She made her way to Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard at some point in June 1999. She was then towed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in December 1999 to participate in &quot;CG-19 Weapons Effect Test (WET)&quot;. On 17 December 1999, a 500lb SLAM-ER missile detonated in the aft portion of the ship. Then on 13 January 2000, an F/A-18 Hornet pilot fired a tactical SLAM-ER and made a direct hit to the forward starboard side of the ship. She was then towed back to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads for evaluation. Ultimately, she was sent back out once more and on 6 April 2000 was sunk as a target off the East Coast near Maryland: 037° 35&#x27; 59.0&quot; North / 070° 45&#x27; 04.0&quot; West... 2,150 Fathoms or 12,900 feet, and 485 feet lower than the RMS Titanic.

<doc id="431968" wikidata="Q422511" url="?curid=431968" title="Cyclic guanosine monophosphate">
<text>Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a cyclic nucleotide derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP acts as a second messenger much like cyclic AMP. Its most likely mechanism of action is activation of intracellular protein kinases in response to the binding of membrane-impermeable peptide hormones to the external cell surface. Through protein kinases activation, cGMP can relax smooth muscle. cGMP concentration in urine can be measured for kidney function and diabetes detection.

== History ==
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) research began after cGMP and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were identified as cellular components and potentially involved with cellular regulation. Upon the synthesis of cGMP in 1960, progress rapidly spread in the understanding of regulation and effects of cGMP. Earl W. Sutherland received the 1971 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work with cAMP and secondary messengers. This award sparked extensive research into cAMP, while cGMP received less attention, with its biological functions largely unknown until the 1980s. During this period, two pivotal discoveries highlighted cGMP’s role in cellular signaling: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was found to stimulate cGMP synthesis through the particulate guanylyl cyclase (pGC) receptor, and nitric oxide (NO), identified as the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, was shown to activate soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), producing cGMP to mediate vasodilation in smooth muscle cells. Further components involved with the cGMP were also identified such as cGMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and cGMP-binding proteins. The awarding of the 1998 Nobel Prize to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro, and Ferid Murad for their discoveries in the NO-cGMP pathway renewed interest in cGMP research with the 1st International Conference on cGMP being held in 2003.

== Synthesis ==

Guanylate cyclase (GC) catalyzes cGMP synthesis. This enzyme converts GTP to cGMP. Peptide hormones such as the atrial natriuretic factor activate membrane-bound GC, while soluble GC (sGC) is typically activated by nitric oxide to stimulate cGMP synthesis. sGC can be inhibited by ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one).

==Functions==
cGMP acts as a regulator of ion channel conductance, glycogenolysis, cellular apoptosis, and platelet inhibition. cGMP relaxes smooth muscle tissue leading to vasodilation which increases blood flow. Additionally, cGMP is involved with neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. At presynaptic terminals in the striatum, cGMP controls the efficacy of neurotransmitter release.

cGMP is a secondary messenger in phototransduction in the eye. In the photoreceptors of the mammalian eye, the presence of light activates phosphodiesterase, which degrades cGMP. The sodium ion channels in photoreceptors are cGMP-gated, so degradation of cGMP causes sodium channels to close, which leads to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor&#x27;s plasma membrane and ultimately to visual information being sent to the brain.

cGMP is also seen to mediate the switching on of the attraction of apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in cortical layer V towards semaphorin-3A (Sema3a). Whereas the axons of pyramidal cells are repelled by Sema3a, the apical dendrites are attracted to it. The attraction is mediated by the increased levels of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) that are present in the apical dendrites. sGC generates cGMP, leading to a sequence of chemical activations that result in the attraction towards Sema3a. The absence of sGC in the axon causes the repulsion from Sema3a. This strategy ensures the structural polarization of pyramidal neurons and takes place in embryonic development.

cGMP, like cAMP, gets synthesized when olfactory receptors receive odorous input. cGMP is produced slowly and has a more sustained life than cAMP, which has implicated it in long-term cellular responses to odor stimulation, such as long-term potentiation. cGMP in the olfactory is synthesized by both membrane guanylyl cyclase (mGC) as well as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Studies have found that cGMP synthesis in the olfactory is due to sGC activation by nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter. cGMP also requires increased intracellular levels of cAMP and the link between the two second messengers appears to be due to rising intracellular calcium levels.
== Pathology ==

=== Role in Cardiovascular Events ===
The nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE) pathway has become a target in developing treatments for heart failure. A deficit in cGMP levels has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, promoting factors like myocardial fibrosis, vasoconstriction, and inflammation, all of which accelerate heart failure progression. Some soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators, have yielded promising outcomes in reducing cardiovascular events. Their effectiveness is thought to result from increased sensitivity of sGC to endogenous NO.

Elevated plasma cGMP levels, regulated predominantly by natriuretic peptides (NP) rather than nitric oxide (NO), were found to correlate with a higher risk of heart failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease.

=== Role in Major Depression Disorder ===
The cGMP signaling pathway plays a role in the regulation of neuroplasticity, an area of interest in understanding the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The cGMP signaling pathway in the brain operates as a second messenger system, amplifying neurotransmitter signals, influencing gene expression and neuronal function. Within neurons, cGMP levels are modulated by guanylate cyclase enzymes, which synthesize cGMP, and by PDEs, which degrade cGMP.

Enhancing cGMP levels, either by stimulating guanylate cyclase or inhibiting PDEs, promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, particularly in brain regions implicated in MDD, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Animal studies also demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment can elevate cGMP levels in these areas. Genetic research has further highlighted specific polymorphisms in PDE genes associated with MDD susceptibility and treatment response.

=== Role in Infectious Disease Pathogenesis ===
Certain pathogens, such as &quot;Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli&quot; (ETEC), elevate cGMP to evade host immune defenses and establish infection. ETEC’s heat-stable toxin induces significant cGMP production within intestinal epithelial cells, and this cGMP is often secreted into the extracellular space, where it serves as a signaling molecule. Extracellular cGMP, in turn, triggers the release of IL-33 release which modulate inflammation and impact the immune system’s ability to mount effective responses, dampening both innate and adaptive immunity.

== Degradation ==

Numerous cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) can degrade cGMP by hydrolyzing cGMP into 5&#x27;-GMP. PDE 5, -6 and -9 are cGMP-specific while PDE1, -2, -3, -10 and -11 can hydrolyse both cAMP and cGMP.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors prevent the degradation of cGMP, thereby enhancing and/or prolonging its effects. For example, Sildenafil (Viagra) and similar drugs enhance the vasodilatory effects of cGMP within the corpus cavernosum by inhibiting PDE 5 (or PDE V). This is used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. However, the drug can inhibit PDE6 in retina (albeit with less affinity than PDE5). This has been shown to result in loss of visual sensitivity but is unlikely to impair common visual tasks, except under conditions of reduced visibility when objects are already near visual threshold. This effect is largely avoided by other PDE5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil.
== Protein kinase activation ==

The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activation pathway begins with the production of cGMP by guanylyl cyclase enzymes, which can be activated by signaling molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) or natriuretic peptides. Elevated cGMP levels then lead to the activation of some protein-dependent kinases like PKG. For example, PKG (protein kinase G) is a dimer consisting of one catalytic and one regulatory unit, with the regulatory units blocking the active sites of the catalytic units.

cGMP binds to sites on the regulatory units of PKG and activates the catalytic units, enabling them to phosphorylate their substrates. Unlike with the activation of some other protein kinases, notably PKA, the PKG is activated but the catalytic and regulatory units do not disassociate.

Once activated, PKG phosphorylates various target proteins, altering their function and contributing to cellular processes such as smooth muscle relaxation, ion channel regulation, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. This pathway is also significant in cardiovascular physiology, where it helps maintain vascular tone and blood pressure.

==Synopsis==

&quot;Touch&quot; follows twin brothers Tatsuya and Kazuya Uesugi, along with their childhood friend and nextdoor neighbor Minami Asakura. Tatsuya, a naturally gifted athlete whose raw skills exceeds Kazuya&#x27;s, has always allowed his hard-working younger brother to take the spotlight, but as the two of them near high school with Minami, Tatsuya realizes that perhaps he does not want to lose Minami to his brother after all. When Kazuya is struck in a traffic accident on the morning before the final game of the regional tournament, Tatsuya takes over his brother&#x27;s position of ace pitcher, and utilizes his natural talent to complete his younger brother&#x27;s goal of fulfilling Minami&#x27;s dream of going to the Koshien.

==Characters==
:The elder of the Uesugi twins, seemingly selfish and lazy, he is actually very altruistic and reluctant to compete against others, especially his brother, Kazuya. A naturally talented athlete, he could be successful in baseball or most sports if he put in the effort but lets his younger brother succeed in his place. Like Kazuya, he loves Minami Asakura, the girl next door and their childhood friend, but initially cedes this relationship to his brother as well. When Tatsuya starts high school he nearly joins the baseball club but, when he hears that Minami has joined as the club manager, he cannot go through with it. Instead, Harada cons him into joining the boxing club with him. Played by:Shota Saito, Tatsuki Shibuya (young)

He and everyone else sees himself and Minami as the perfect couple who will eventually marry. He strives to lead Meisei to win the prefectural tournament and advance to the national tournament at the Koushien, fulfilling a childhood promise to take Minami there.

Like Kazuya, she sees Tatsuya&#x27;s true potential and kind heart.

Despite her bratty behavior, she is also a very good student who scores even higher in history exams than Sakata.

Due to overusing his curve ball he suffers damages his elbow and can no longer effectively pitch in his final tournament. 
:Coach of the Meisei High team. He becomes ill in the brothers&#x27; senior year, and must stay in the hospital throughout the prefectural tournament. He assigns an interim coach, Eijiro Kashiwaba, to fill his position, touting him as a &quot;kind, gentle man who loves baseball from the bottom of his heart,&quot; unaware that he had gotten him confused with his elder brother, the more popular Eiichirō. Coach Nishio returns at the end of the prefectural tournament. 
:A brutal and spartan substitute coach that fills in while Coach Nishio is ill. Nishio meant to recommend his brother, Eiichirō, but either he or the school got the names mixed up. On his first day, he fires Minami as manager and ruthlessly beats Tatsuya. His training consists of further beatings, humiliation, and working the players beyond exhaustion. Most first year members of the team quickly resigned. He holds a grudge against Meisei&#x27;s baseball team because of some events that occurred when he attended. He also compares the Uesugi twins&#x27; relationship to his own poor relationship with his own brother. 
:Daughter of Coach Nishio, girlfriend of Kuroki, and early manager for the Meisei High team. Early on, she mistakes Tatsuya for Kazuya and recognizes his athletic ability, encouraging him to join the team as well. 
:Upperclassman of Kazuya who initially scouts him and finds his pitching so incredible that he unselfishly gives up his position as Meisei&#x27;s ace the following year. He moves to third base and becomes team captain. He and his girlfriend Sachiko see talent in Tatsuya as well as Kazuya, and try to get him to join the team, especially after Kazuya dies. Played by:Fuuma Uehara
:Transfer student to Meisei High who initially idolizes Tatsuya. He joins the team in their second year to be close to him and to try to gain self confidence. As his skills increase as a pitcher, being able to effectively mimic both Tasuya&#x27;s fastball and Nishimura&#x27;s curve ball with great control, he grows from confident to over-confident, conceited, and condescending. He challenges Tatsuya in a pitching contest for the ace position but before the duel can be held he has to move to South America due to his father&#x27;s job. He returns in his third year as a cocky and ill-mannered pitcher of another team to play a game against Meisei. → 
:
:In the same class as Yuka Nitta and top student of their year. Despite being timid and not athletic, he joins the team and sticks with it even after the majority of the other new students quit. He falls in love with Yuka and tenaciously tries to win her affection.
:The brother of Eijirō, and the one who Coach Nishio thought he was hiring. He might not be the model baseball hero that many believe him to be.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command used to update the access date and/or modification date of a computer file or directory. It is included in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, TSC&#x27;s FLEX, Digital Research/Novell DR DOS, the AROS shell, the Microware OS-9 shell, and ReactOS.
The command is also available for FreeDOS and Microsoft Windows.

==Overview==
In its default usage, it is the equivalent of creating or opening a file and saving it without any change to the file contents. codice_1 avoids opening, saving, and closing the file. Instead it simply updates the dates associated with the file or directory. An updated access or modification date can be important for a variety of other programs such as backup utilities or the make command-line interface programming utility. Typically these types of programs are only concerned with files which have been created or modified after the program was last run. The codice_1 command can also be useful for quickly creating files for programs or scripts that require a file with a specific name to exist for successful operation of the program, but do not require the file to have any specific content.

The Single Unix Specification (SUS) specifies that codice_1 should change the access times, modification times, or both, for a file. The file is identified by a pathname supplied as a single argument. It also specifies that if the file identified does not exist, the file is created and the access and modification times are set as specified. If no new timestamps are specified, codice_1 uses the current time.

==History==
A codice_1 utility first appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX. Today, the command is available for a number of different operating systems, including many Unix and Unix-like systems, DOS, Microsoft Windows and the classic Mac OS.

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Paul Rubin, Arnold Robbins, Jim Kingdon, David MacKenzie, and Randy Smith.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The FreeDOS version was developed by Kris Heidenstrom and is licensed under the GPL. DR DOS 6.0 and KolibriOS include an implementation of the command. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

<doc id="431975" wikidata="Q520254" url="?curid=431975" title="Terry Sawchuk">
<text>Terrance Gordon Sawchuk (December 28, 1929 – May 31, 1970) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played 21 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins, Toronto Maple Leafs, Los Angeles Kings, and New York Rangers between 1950 and 1970. He won the Calder Trophy, earned the Vezina Trophy four times, was a four-time Stanley Cup champion, and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame the year after his final season, one of 10 players for whom the three-year waiting period was waived.

At the time of his death, Sawchuk was the all-time leader among NHL goaltenders with 447 wins and with 103 shutouts. In the decades following his death, his NHL win record has been surpassed by seven goaltenders, and his NHL shutout record has been surpassed by one goaltender, though Sawchuk was the all-time leader in wins and shutouts by goaltenders who played in the Original Six era (1942–1967). In 2017, Sawchuk was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot;.

==Early life and playing career==
===Childhood and junior career===
Sawchuk was born in the North End of Winnipeg
and raised there until his family moved to Bowman Avenue in East Kildonan, a working-class, formerly Ukrainian section of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He was the third of four sons and one adopted daughter of Louis Sawchuk, a tinsmith who had immigrated to Canada as a boy from Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine), and his wife Anne (&quot;nee&quot; Maslak), a homemaker. The second son died young from scarlet fever and the oldest, an aspiring hockey goaltender whom Terry idolized, died suddenly of a heart attack at age seventeen. At age twelve, Sawchuk injured his right elbow playing rugby and, not wanting to be punished by his parents, hid the injury, preventing the dislocation from properly healing. Thus, the injury left his right arm with limited mobility and was now also several inches shorter than the left, which bothered him for his entire athletic career. After inheriting his good friend&#x27;s goalie equipment, Sawchuk began playing ice hockey in a local league and worked for a sheet-metal company installing vents over bakery ovens. His goaltending talent was so evident that at age fourteen a local scout for the Detroit Red Wings had him work out with the team, who later signed him to an amateur contract and sent him to play for their junior team in Galt, Ontario, in 1946, where he also finished the eleventh grade but most likely did not graduate from high school. He excelled in many sports. He played baseball for a number of years for the Elmwood Giants first in the Manitoba Senior AA League starting in 1948, when he won the league&#x27;s batting title, and then in Mandak League. He played in both the infield and the outfield.

===Detroit Red Wings===
The Red Wings signed Sawchuk to a professional contract in 1947, and he quickly progressed through their developmental system, winning honors as the Rookie of the Year in both the U.S. and American Hockey Leagues. Sawchuk also filled in for seven games when the Detroit goalie Harry Lumley was injured in January 1950. Sawchuk showed such promise that the Red Wings traded Lumley to the Chicago Black Hawks, though he had just led the team to the 1950 Stanley Cup. Nicknamed &quot;Ukey&quot; or &quot;The Uke&quot; by his teammates because of his Ukrainian ancestry, Sawchuk led the Red Wings to three Stanley Cup wins in five years, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top rookie and three Vezina Trophies for the fewest goals allowed (he missed out the other two years by one goal). He was selected as an All-Star five times in his first five years in the NHL, had fifty-six shutouts, and his goals-against average (GAA) remained under 2.00. In the 1951–52 playoffs, the Red Wings swept both the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens, with Sawchuk surrendering five goals in eight games (for a 0.625 GAA), with four shutouts. During the last of these eight games, the Legend of the Octopus began as the first of the eight-limbed molluscs was hurled onto the ice from the stands.

Sawchuk was ordered by Detroit general manager Jack Adams to lose weight before the 1951–52 season. After his weight loss, his personality seemed to change and he became sullen and withdrawn. He became increasingly surly with reporters and fans, preferring to do crossword puzzles than give interviews. He also struggled for years to regain the weight. Also contributing to his moodiness and self-doubt was the pressure of playing every day despite repeated injuries — there were no backup goaltenders. He frequently played through pain, and during his career he had three operations on his right elbow, an appendectomy, countless cuts and bruises, a broken foot, a collapsed lung, ruptured discs in his back, and severed tendons in his hand. A standup goaltender, he adopted a crouching stance to see through the legs of skaters. Years of crouching in the net caused Sawchuk to walk with a permanent stoop and resulted in lordosis (swayback), which prevented him from sleeping for more than two hours at a time. He also received approximately 400 stitches to his face (including three in his right eyeball) before finally adopting a protective facemask in 1962. In 1966, Life Magazine had a make-up artist apply stitches and scars to Sawchuk&#x27;s face to demonstrate all of the injuries his face sustained over the years. The make-up artist did not have enough room for everything.

===Boston Bruins; return to Detroit; Toronto and Los Angeles===
The Red Wings traded Sawchuk to the Boston Bruins in June 1955 because they had a capable younger goaltender in the minor leagues (Glenn Hall). This devastated Sawchuk. During his second season with Boston, Sawchuk was diagnosed with mononucleosis, but returned to the team after only two weeks. Physically weak, playing poorly, and on the verge of a nervous breakdown and exhaustion, he announced his retirement in early 1957 and was labeled a &quot;quitter&quot; by team executives and several newspapers. Detroit reacquired Sawchuk by trading young forward Johnny Bucyk to Boston. After seven seasons, when they had another promising young goalie (Roger Crozier) ready for promotion from the minor leagues, Detroit left Sawchuk unprotected in the 1964 NHL Intra-League Draft, and he was quickly claimed by the Maple Leafs. With Sawchuk sharing goaltending duties with the forty-year-old Johnny Bower, the veteran duo won the 1964–65 Vezina Trophy and led Toronto to the 1967 Stanley Cup. In Sawchuk&#x27;s last game with the Maple Leafs, he stopped 40 of 41 shots in 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens in the Cup clinching game 6. Left unprotected in the June 1967 expansion draft, Sawchuk was the first player selected, taken by the Los Angeles Kings where he played one season before being traded back to Detroit.

===New York Rangers===
In June 1969, the Red Wings traded Sawchuk and Sandy Snow to the New York Rangers for Larry Jeffrey. Sawchuk played sparingly for the Rangers, starting only six games. On February 1, 1970, in only his fourth start of the season, he recorded his 103rd and final shutout of his career by blanking the Pittsburgh Penguins 6–0. This was also his last NHL win. His last regular season start was on March 14, 1970, in a 7–4 loss to the Chicago Black Hawks. Sawchuk&#x27;s last playoff start was in a 5–3 playoff quarterfinals loss to the Boston Bruins on April 9, 1970. Sawchuk appeared in his last NHL game on April 14 in the same playoff series. In game 5, after Phil Esposito had scored at 7:59 of the third period to put Boston in the lead, Rangers coach Emile Francis, in an effort to slow down the game, replaced goalie Ed Giacomin with Sawchuk. He was in the net for less than a minute before Giacomin returned and the Rangers lost the game 3–2. Boston went on to win the series 4 
games to 2.

==Personal life==

Sawchuk married Patricia Ann Bowman Morey on August 6, 1953, after a brief courtship. They had seven children, and the family endured many years of Sawchuk&#x27;s increasing alcoholism, philandering (he impregnated a Toronto girlfriend in 1967), and verbal and physical abuse. Morey threatened to divorce him numerous times, and finally did so in 1969.

==Death==

Sawchuk struggled with untreated depression, a condition that often affected his conduct. On April 29, 1970, after the 1969–70 season ended, Sawchuk and Rangers teammate Ron Stewart, both of whom had been drinking, physically fought over expenses for the house they rented together on Long Island, New York. Sawchuk suffered severe internal injuries during the scuffle from falling on top of Stewart&#x27;s bent knee. At Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Sawchuk&#x27;s gallbladder was removed and he had a second operation on his damaged and bleeding liver. The press described the incident as &quot;horseplay&quot;, and Sawchuk told the police that he accepted full responsibility for the events. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was little understood during his era in sports but may have contributed to his depression and behaviour and would be consistent with the degree of head trauma he experienced during his career.

At New York Hospital Manhattan, another operation was performed on Sawchuk&#x27;s bleeding liver. He never recovered and died shortly thereafter from a pulmonary embolism on May 31, 1970, at the age of 40. The last reporter to speak to him, a week before his death, was Shirley Fischler (wife of Stan Fischler), who went to see him in the hospital as a visitor, not identifying herself as a reporter. Sawchuk told her the incident with Stewart &quot;was just a fluke, a complete fluke accident.&quot; Fischler described him as &quot;so pale and thin that the scars had almost disappeared from his face.&quot; A Nassau County grand jury exonerated Stewart and ruled that Sawchuk&#x27;s death was accidental. Sawchuk was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Pontiac, Michigan.

==Legacy==

During his career, Sawchuk won 501 games (447 regular season and 54 playoff), while recording 115 shutouts, (103 in the regular season and 12 in the playoffs). Sawchuk set the standard for measuring goaltenders, and was publicly hailed as the &quot;best goalie ever&quot; by a rival general manager in 1952, during only his second season. Sawchuk finished his hockey career with 447 wins, a record that stood for thirty years, and his career record of 103 shutouts remained unsurpassed among NHL goaltenders, until Martin Brodeur bested that mark on December 21, 2009. In 1971, Sawchuk was posthumously elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame and awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for his contribution to hockey in the United States. The Red Wings retired his number 1 in 1994. In 1996, the book &quot;Shutout: The Legend of Terry Sawchuk&quot; by sports author Brian Kendall, was published. A second book &quot;Sawchuk: The troubles and triumphs of the World&#x27;s Greatest Goalie&quot; was published in 1998 by David Dupuis, with the participation of the Sawchuk family. In 2001, he was honored with his image on a Canadian postage stamp, even though he had become a U.S. citizen in 1959. In 2008, &quot;Night Work: The Sawchuk Poems,&quot; a book of poetry about Sawchuk by Randall Maggs, was published. The Terry Sawchuk Arena in his hometown of Winnipeg is named in his honour. In 2019, a film about his life and times was released, titled &quot;Goalie&quot;.

When he joined the Maple Leafs, Sawchuk originally wore jersey number 24, but switched to 30. In the decades since, NHL goaltenders have chosen numbers in the 30s inspired by his example and that of players like the Canadiens&#x27; Patrick Roy, who would have used 30 (the jersey number Rogie Vachon had used), but he was forced to pick another since it was already taken by right winger Chris Nilan (he instead chose 33, which itself became popular as a choice).

<doc id="431985" wikidata="Q263490" url="?curid=431985" title="Control Language">
<text>The Control Language (CL) is a scripting language originally created by IBM for the System/38 Control Program Facility and later used in OS/400 (now known as IBM i). It bears a resemblance to the IBM Job Control Language and consists of a set of command objects (*CMD) used to invoke traditional programs or get help on what those programs do. CL can also be used to create CL programs (congruent to shell scripts) where there are additional commands that provide program-like functionality (IF/ELSE, variable declaration, file input, etc.)

Although CL is a scripting language for system administration, it is used mainly to create compiled programs. The use of interpreted CL scripts through the SBMDBJOB command is in fact extremely limited.

While thousands of commands were written by IBM developers to perform system-level tasks like compiling programs, backing up data, changing system configurations, displaying system object details, or deleting them, commands are not limited to systems-level concerns and can be drafted for user applications as well.

==Commands and programs==
Parameters (command-line arguments) defined in the main procedures of all traditional System/38 and AS/400 programs are hard-coded lists that are made up of parameters that can be numeric, alphanumeric, Boolean, etc. and the order in which parameters are passed is important. This is a stark difference from the Unix and DOS worlds where the parameter list in Unix shell scripts and C programs is a set or array of character pointers and more often than not the parameters are not positionally dependent.

The developer&#x27;s solution to this problem was the command object (*CMD). While the parameters on the command can be specified in any order, each parameter is defined to be passed in a specific order to the program. The programmer can also define, among other things, the parameter&#x27;s data type, unique parameter name, descriptive text (for prompting), default value (used only if the parameter isn&#x27;t specified during execution), if the values are restricted to a certain set or range if the data entered should be changed to another value before calling the program, etc.

At its most basic a command names a single program to call when the user types or prompts the command and presses the Enter key. The command takes all of the parameters typed by the user, and those not typed by the user, and builds a parameter list that it passes to the program when it&#x27;s called.

==Syntax==
The BNF for a much simplified CL command syntax would be defined as follows:

 &lt;CL-command&gt; ::= command-name [&lt;positional-parameter-list&gt;] [&lt;named-parameter-list&gt;]

 &lt;positional-parameter-list&gt; ::= &lt;parameter-value&gt; [&lt;positional-parameter-list&gt;]

 &lt;named-parameter-list&gt; ::= parameter-name &quot;(&quot; &lt;parameter-element-list&gt; &quot;)&quot; [&lt;named-parameter-list&gt;]

 &lt;parameter-element-list&gt; ::= &lt;parameter-value&gt; [&lt;parameter-element-list&gt;]

 &lt;parameter-value&gt; ::= CL-name |
 qualified-CL-name |
 &quot;*&quot;special-value |
 generic-CL-name&quot;*&quot; |
 &quot;&#x27;&quot;alphanumeric-value&quot;&#x27;&quot; |
 numeric-value |
 &quot;X&#x27;&quot;hexadecimal-value&quot;&#x27;&quot;

The items above that end in &quot;-name&quot; follow object naming conventions which, generally speaking, means the name starts with a letter and can be up to ten characters in length. (CL commands are also case-insensitive.)

A good example of a typical CL command is the Change Program (CHGPGM) command below:

 CHGPGM MYPGM OPTIMIZE(*FULL) RMVOBS(*BLKORD *PRCORD) TEXT(&#x27;My program.&#x27;)

The above command is passing four parameters to the program that does &quot;Change Program&quot; processing and they are:

* MYPGM: A positional parameter (PGM), and the only required parameter. In this case it&#x27;s the name of the program being changed. Positional parameters are always first. Once a named parameter appears all parameters that follow must be named parameters.
* OPTIMIZE(*FULL): A named parameter specifying a single element which is a special value. In this case it will change the program to be fully optimized.
* RMVOBS(*BLKORD *PRCORD): A named parameter (Remove Observability) specifying multiple special values. In this case telling it to remove two kinds of profiling data from the program.
* TEXT(&#x27;My program.&#x27;): Another named parameter specifying a single alphanumeric value. In this case it&#x27;s changing the descriptive text of the program.

In reality the system will pass many more parameters than the four specified above. This is because the rest of the CHGPGM command&#x27;s parameters were not specified, so default values will be passed instead. For every parameter on this, aside from the PGM parameter, that default is &quot;*SAME&quot;, meaning don&#x27;t change it.

==Prompting==
All CL commands can be prompted directly from the command line or within CL program source by typing the command and pressing the F4 function key. An OS/400 command can also be prompted by typing a ? before the command.
(This is useful in an interactive program which cues a command string, having already filled in some values.)

The system will then present a screen with the set of parameters that the program accepts/requires (required parameters are usually highlighted).

Required parameters are listed first, and parameters with system-supplied default values are listed last of all. To see all parameters, press F10. 
If any one choice requires further selections, those are cued as you select that value for that parameter, by appearing onscreen.

Prompting is further enhanced to allow the programmer to find what values are valid for each parameter. To do this during prompting the user would move the cursor to the parameter field in question and press F4 again. The system would then display a screen describing the type of input required and an available list of allowable values.

To enter a longer name, or extend the list to allow you to enter extra values, type a plus sign instead of a value. (As when listing names of objects to be saved or restored.)

==Command help==
Cursor sensitive help can also be provided on commands but it&#x27;s not required. If help has been provided one can view help for a parameter by moving the cursor to the desired parameter field and pressing F1 (help). To get help for the entire command itself (and all of its parameters) the user would press F1 anywhere on the prompt display and then press F2 (extended help).

==Creating new commands==
New commands can be created to call non-system programs and they will work exactly like the inbuilt variety. The Command Definition Language is described in the CL Programmer&#x27;s Guide.

It&#x27;s a good idea to create help screens for new commands and their parameters. All help screens use panel group objects (*PNLGRP) and these can be created using the UIM language described in the IBM AS/400 Application Display Programming manual.

Beginning in V5R3 of the operating system a new, much simpler method of creating help was added: run the command
 GENCMDDOC CMD(MYLIB/MYCMD) TODIR(&#x27;/QSYS.LIB/MYLIB.LIB/QPNLSRC.FILE) GENOPT(*UIM)
A skeleton UIM panel group will be automatically generated including all parameters described by the command. The result file can be edited (seu, wdsc, rdi), then compiled with the CRTPNLGRP command, and finally associated with the command via CHGCMD HLPPNLGRP().

==Finding the right command==
There are 2,262 built-in IBM commands contained in V7R3, but finding them isn&#x27;t all that hard because of several designs of the system that make life easier. These labor saving designs are: Standardized Abbreviations, Command Grouping Menus, and Command Selection.

===Standardized abbreviations===
The IBM developers standardized the abbreviations used to create command names. Verbs like &quot;change&quot; are always rendered as &quot;CHG&quot;, &quot;display&quot; as &quot;DSP&quot;, &quot;work&quot; as &quot;WRK&quot;, &quot;create&quot; as &quot;CRT&quot;, etc. Subjects like &quot;program&quot; are always &quot;PGM&quot;, &quot;user&quot; is &quot;USR&quot;, &quot;module&quot; is &quot;MOD&quot;, &quot;server&quot; is &quot;SVR&quot;, etc. You can see every possible verb and subject used on the system in the VERB and SUBJECT menus, just enter the commands GO VERB or GO SUBJECT.

Likewise, &quot;Control Language Programming&quot; was abbreviated CLP, and the source type was accordingly CLP. With the introduction of the ILE programming model, the source type was changed to &quot;CLLE&quot;.

===Command grouping menus===
The VERB and SUBJECT menus are part of what are called the Command Grouping Menus. For every Three (or four) Letter abbreviation there is a menu devoted to it that starts with the letters &quot;CMD&quot;. So to see all &quot;CHG&quot; commands the user would execute the command GO CMDCHG. For &quot;program&quot; commands the menu would be CMDPGM.

There are other menus besides the Command Grouping Menus. The starting point for the menuing system can be accessed by pressing F4 on an empty command line.

===Command selection===
If one only knows part of a command or if third party software is being used where the commands don&#x27;t conform to the AS/400 abbreviation standard then you would enter that part of the command that is known, attach an asterisk (to make it generic), and press enter. The system will then display a list of commands in the job&#x27;s library list that match the generic names just typed. One can then page through the list looking for the command needed and then select it using option 1.

In the background the system is using the SLTCMD command to perform this function. If one wants to select all commands in a library then prompt this command and enter the special value *ALL.

==Sample code==
The following is a sample of CL programming. The program interactively converts dates from Julian to MDY and vice versa. Results are displayed on line 24 of the terminal. It accepts two parameters. The codice_1 parameter which is the date string to be converted. If a Julian string it should be in the format YYNNN where YY is the year number and NNN is the day number of the year. If a MDY string it must be in the format MMDDYY. The second parameter is codice_2 which is the type of date to be converted to. It must be &#x27;J&#x27; (Julian) or &#x27;M&#x27; (MDY). For example: the command codice_3 will convert the Julian date 04180 to 062804 (June 28, 2004).

<text>Echo Park is a neighborhood in the east-central region of Los Angeles, California. Located to the northwest of Downtown, it is bordered by Silver Lake to the west and Chinatown to the east. The culturally diverse neighborhood has become known for its trendy local businesses, as well as its popularity with artists, musicians and creatives. The neighborhood is centered on the eponymous Echo Park Lake.

==History==
===Edendale===

Established in 1892, and long before &quot;Hollywood&quot; became synonymous with the commercial film industry of the United States, the area of Echo Park known as Edendale was the center of filmmaking on the West Coast.

By the 1910s, several film studios were operating on Allesandro Avenue (now Glendale Boulevard) along the Echo Park-Silverlake border, including the Selig Polyscope Company, Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone Studios, the Pathe West Coast Film Studio, and others.

Silent film stars who worked in the Edendale studios included 
Fatty Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd,
Mabel Normand and Gloria Swanson. Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s first film was made at Keystone Studios, as well as the very first feature-length comedy, which starred Chaplin and Normand.

The first pie-in-the-face scene was filmed at what later became the Mack Sennett Studios on Glendale Boulevard near Effie Street. The complex, which is now part of a storage facility, dates from 1909 and includes one of the area&#x27;s first permanent sound stages, the factories where movies are made. The former studio, 1712 Glendale Boulevard, is City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 256.

===Echo Park Lake===

Echo Park Lake was established in 1868, as a drinking water reservoir, filled with water from a ditch that connects to the Los Angeles River in Los Feliz to the reservoir. In 1891, the four owners of the surrounding area gave up of land around the reservoir to the city so that it could be used as a park. The city began work landscaping the park in October 1892. City parks superintendent Joseph Henry Tomlinson chose the name because of echoes he heard during the construction of Echo Park Lake in 1892. By 1895, the park and accompanying boathouse were completed. By the late 1910s, motion picture companies on Allesandro Street, now Glendale Boulevard, had been using the park as a filming location.

Echo Park Lake was identified as an impaired body of water in 2006, and the city allocated $64.7 million to fund its cleanup and revitalization. In the summer of 2011, the lake was closed off and drained when the rehabilitation project began. The lake reopened on June 5, 2013, after a $45 million renovation.

Starting in November 2019, a growing population of homeless people began moving into the lake grounds. The encampment included nearly 200 homeless tents, and four homeless individuals died at the park in 2020. On March 25, 2021, the park was closed for renovations and cleared of the homeless encampments. While closure notices were posted throughout the park days before the sweep, over 200 protesters clashed with LAPD, who arrested 179 protesters. The encampment and ensuing incident became a major flashpoint in LA&#x27;s homelessness crisis.

Of the 183 homeless individuals living at Echo Park Lake, only 17 had successfully transitioned into permanent housing . In February 2023, councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez announced plans to remove the fence that encircles the lake. The plans became divisive within the community, many of whom have advocated for the fence to remain, amid the ongoing homelessness crisis.

The fence surrounding the lake was removed May 30, 2023 by the city.

===Transportation===
==== Glendale Freeway termination ====

The Glendale Freeway (SR 2) was originally planned and constructed in 1959 to connect with the Hollywood Freeway (US-101) through the neighborhoods of Silver Lake and Echo Park, but terminates roughly northeast of its intended terminus at the Hollywood Freeway due to opposition from residents living and developers building on a hill that is now a private gated community called Hathaway Estates.

In 1962, as a result of this local community opposition, the full build-out plan was rescinded and construction was terminated at the present SR-2 terminus near Glendale Boulevard and Duane Street. Since then, commuter traffic exiting and entering on to SR-2 has passed through the community, primarily along Glendale Boulevard and Alvarado Street, which has contributed to congestion. Since that plan was scrapped, the freeway has been somewhat isolated from the remainder of the Los Angeles freeway system. There have been proposals to turn the freeway stub into a sort of public park.

====Pacific Electric Railway====

The Pacific Electric Railway, better known as the Red Cars, used to run through Echo Park along the center of Glendale Boulevard. The citywide system of electric trolleys began with the dawn of the 20th century, ultimately spinning a web of rail that linked cities in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. It was the largest and most advanced public transit system in the world at the time.

The Red Car system was sold to Metropolitan Coach Lines, whose executive, Jesse Haugh, had connections to a public transportation company funded by General Motors and other auto-related industries. The Red Cars faded out of service not long afterwards, with the Los Angeles-Glendale-Burbank Line that traveled through Echo Park officially ending service on June 19, 1955.

=== Gangs ===
Echo Park was once infamous as a hot spot for gang activity. This was true in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the early 2010s as the neighborhood began gentrifying, rents started to skyrocket, and a controversial gang injunction forced gang members to move outside their turf, instances of gang violence waned.

In 2013, a Los Angeles judge signed off on a permanent gang injunction aimed at six rival gangs in the Echo Park area, creating what authorities call a &quot;safety zone&quot; for the area. The injunction targets the members of six gangs, namely Echo Park Locos, the Crazys, the Big Top Locos, the Diamond Street Locos, Frogtown Rifa, and Head Hunters. The perimeter for the safety zone is roughly bound by the Los Angeles River to the north, the 110 Freeway to the east, Beverly Boulevard to south and Glendale Boulevard to the west. It includes Echo Park Lake and Dodger Stadium.

The injunction, a civil order, prohibits two or more listed gang members from associating in any way in public or in common areas like courtyards. It also allows for stricter penalties if any listed gang member is caught with drugs, alcohol, guns or vandalizing property.

==Geography==
Echo Park has many rolling hills and valleys with a few flat areas like Echo Park Lake. Its main commercial corridors are Sunset and Glendale boulevards.
=== Location ===
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; project, Echo Park is in Central Los Angeles, between Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. It is situated near the 101, the 2, and the 5 freeways. Echo Park is flanked by Elysian Valley to the north and northeast, Elysian Park to the east, Chinatown and Downtown to the southeast, Westlake to the southwest and west, and Silver Lake to the northwest.

Boundaries are the Golden State Freeway–Glendale Freeway interchange at the north apex, Riverside Drive on the northeast, Elysian Park neighborhood on the east, Stadium Way and Beaudry Avenue on the southeast, the south apex being Beaudry Avenue and West Second Street and the west limit being an irregular line consisting of Second Street and Beverly Boulevard, then moving upward north along Benton Way and the Glendale Freeway.

===Climate===
Being in the central part of Los Angeles, Echo Park experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). Temperatures here are almost identical to that of Downtown Los Angeles.

===Districts===

Within Echo Park are the following:

====Angelino Heights====

Angelino Heights is most notable for its Victorian era residences, although these are few in number. It lies at an elevation of .

====Elysian Heights====

Since the 1910s, Elysian Heights, along with Edendale, has been home to many of the counter-culture, political radicals, artists, writers, architects and filmmakers. The children of many progressives attended school there during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

==Population==
===2000===
The 2000 U.S. census counted 40,455 residents in the neighborhood—an average of 16,868 people per square mile, one of the highest densities in Los Angeles and among the highest densities for the county. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 43,832. The median age for residents was 30, about the same as the city norm.

Echo Park was considered moderately diverse ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 64%; Asians, 18.8%; whites, 12.9%; blacks, 2%, and others, 2.3%. Mexico (41.3%) and El Salvador (15.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 53% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high compared to the city as a whole.

===2008===
The median household income in 2008 dollars was $37,708, a low figure for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $20,000 or less. The average household size of three people was about the same as the rest of the city. Renters occupied 76% of the housing units, and house- or apartment owners the rest.

The percentages of never-married men and women, 46.8% and 38.3%, respectively, were among the county&#x27;s highest. The 2000 census found 5,325 families headed by single parents, a high rate for both the city and the county. There were 1,034 military veterans in 2000, or 3.5%, a low figure for Los Angeles.

===2010===
Census data below for is cited from only US Census District 1974.20. It does not include a large portion of Echo Park.

The 2010 US Census estimates that the neighborhood demographics for tract 1974.20 are as follows: Latinos still form the majority of the community, though the percentage fell from 69.8% in 2000 to 59.5% in 2010; Whites grew from 13.2% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2010; Asian population remained almost unchanged at 13.3% in 2010 compared to 13.2% in 2000; Other grew from 3.4% in 2000 to 4% in 2010. The number of people in the district shrank by almost 15% to around 3,500 people. This represents less than 10% of the number of residents considered to live in Echo Park. The demographic shift from Latino to White is generally acknowledged as the overall trend in the area.

===Homeless population===
In 2022, there were 423 homeless individuals in Echo Park.

==Parks and recreation==
===Parks===
====Elysian Park====
Elysian Park is one of the largest parks in Los Angeles at . It is also the city&#x27;s oldest park, founded in 1886 by the Elysian Park Enabling Ordinance. Most of Elysian Park falls in the Eastern neighborhood of the same name, but a small portion of the park does fall in Echo Park.

<doc id="431999" wikidata="Q6697100" url="?curid=431999" title="Lucien Laurin">
<text>Lucien Laurin (March 18, 1912 – June 26, 2000) was a French-Canadian jockey and Hall of Fame Thoroughbred horse trainer. He was best known for training Secretariat, who won the Triple Crown in 1973.

==Life and career==
Laurin was born in Joliette, Quebec, Canada. His career in Thoroughbred horse racing began in 1929 as a jockey at Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal, Quebec. Battling weight problems, after riding 161 race winners, in 1942 he began working as a trainer in New England, a job that would span 45 years and take him to the pinnacle of horse racing success. While working for two different stables, he enjoyed a long and successful association with owner Reginald N. Webster. For Webster, Laurin trained a number of winners including Quill, the 1958 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly, and Amberoid, who won the 1966 Wood Memorial Stakes and gave Laurin his first of six American Classics, the Belmont Stakes.

His son, Roger Laurin, worked as a trainer at Christopher Chenery&#x27;s Meadow Stable and when Roger accepted an offer to work for Ogden Phipps, he suggested to Penny Chenery Tweedy that his father might help them on a temporary basis. Coming out of retirement in 1971, Lucien Laurin went to work at the Meadow Stable for what was supposed to be a temporary period. At that time, the stable was having financial difficulties but things soon changed. With their colt, Riva Ridge, earning more than $500,000 and being named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt for 1971, Lucien Laurin and the Meadow Stable would soon become the number one stable in racing, winning numerous important Stakes races and five of the six U.S. Triple Crown races in 1972–73.

Under Lucien Laurin, Riva Ridge, with fellow Canadian jockey Ron Turcotte in the saddle, won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes. A heavy rainstorm muddied the track at Pimlico Race Course; otherwise the horse might have won the Triple Crown. For 1972, Lucien Laurin was named the National Thoroughbred Racing Association&#x27;s Eclipse Award winner as North America&#x27;s most outstanding trainer. However, despite this success, Laurin is best known as the trainer of Secretariat who was voted the 1972 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, and the 1972 and 1973 American Horse of the Year and who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in twenty-five years and the horse ranked #2 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century.

Lucien Laurin retired from racing a second time in 1976, but returned in 1983 as trainer and part owner of Evergreen Stable. In all, he trained a total of 36 stakes winners and was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1977 and enshrined in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame the following year.

==Death==
Laurin was living at his home in Key Largo, Florida, when he died in 2000 at a Miami hospital.

<text>Arthur Holly Compton (September 10, 1892 – March 15, 1962) was an American physicist who shared the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics with C. T. R. Wilson for his discovery of the Compton effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation. It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership over the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago during the Manhattan Project, and served as chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953.

In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made principally of positively charged particles.

During World War II, Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first nuclear weapons. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became a member of the executive committee, and then head of the &quot;X&quot; projects overseeing the Metallurgical Laboratory, with responsibility for producing nuclear reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb. Compton oversaw Enrico Fermi&#x27;s creation of Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Plutonium began being produced in the Hanford Site reactors in 1945.

After the war, Compton became chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. During his tenure, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions, named its first female full professor, and enrolled a record number of students after wartime veterans returned to the United States.

== Early life ==

Arthur Compton was born on September 10, 1892, in Wooster, Ohio, the son of Elias and Otelia Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Augspurger) Compton, who was named American Mother of the Year in 1939 and was of German Mennonite descent.
They were an academic family. Elias was dean of the University of Wooster (later the College of Wooster), which Arthur also attended. Arthur&#x27;s eldest brother, Karl, who also attended Wooster, earned a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in physics from Princeton University in 1912, and was president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1948. His second brother Wilson likewise attended Wooster, earned his PhD in economics from Princeton in 1916 and was president of the State College of Washington, later Washington State University from 1944 to 1951. All three brothers were members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

Compton was initially interested in astronomy, and took a photograph of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1910. Around 1913, he described an experiment where an examination of the motion of water in a circular tube demonstrated the rotation of the earth, a device now known as the Compton generator. That year, he graduated from Wooster with a Bachelor of Science degree and entered Princeton, where he received his Master of Arts degree in 1914. Compton then studied for his PhD in physics under the supervision of Hereward L. Cooke, writing his dissertation on &quot;The Intensity of X-Ray Reflection, and the Distribution of the Electrons in Atoms&quot;.

When Arthur Compton earned his PhD in 1916, he, Karl and Wilson became the first group of three brothers to earn Ph.D.s from Princeton. Later, they would become the first such trio to simultaneously head American colleges. Their sister Mary married a missionary, C. Herbert Rice, who became the principal of Forman Christian College in Lahore. In June 1916, Compton married Betty Charity McCloskey, a Wooster classmate and fellow graduate. They had two sons, Arthur Alan Compton and John Joseph Compton.

Compton spent a year as a physics instructor at the University of Minnesota in 1916–17, then two years as a research engineer with the Westinghouse Lamp Company in Pittsburgh, where he worked on the development of the sodium-vapor lamp. During World War I he developed aircraft instrumentation for the Signal Corps.

In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George Paget Thomson, the son of J. J. Thomson, Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson.

From 1926 to 1927, he taught at the department of chemistry of the University of the Punjab where he was a Guggenheim Fellow.

For a time Compton was a deacon at a Baptist church. &quot;Science can have no quarrel&quot;, he said, &quot;with a religion which postulates a God to whom men are as His children.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Compton effect ===
Returning to the United States, Compton was appointed Wayman Crow Professor of Physics, and head of the department of physics at Washington University in St. Louis in 1920. In 1922, he found that X-ray quanta scattered by free electrons had longer wavelengths and, in accordance with Planck&#x27;s relation, less energy than the incoming X-rays, the surplus energy having been transferred to the electrons. This discovery, known as the &quot;Compton effect&quot; or &quot;Compton scattering&quot;, demonstrated the particle concept of electromagnetic radiation.

In 1923, Compton published a paper in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to photons, something Einstein had invoked for his 1905 Nobel Prize–winning explanation of the photo-electric effect. First postulated by Max Planck in 1900, these were conceptualized as elements of light &quot;quantized&quot; by containing a specific amount of energy depending only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron. His paper concludes by reporting on experiments that verified his derived relation:
:formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the initial wavelength,
:formula_3 is the wavelength after scattering,
:formula_4 is the Planck constant,
:formula_5 is the electron rest mass,
:formula_6 is the speed of light, and
:formula_7 is the scattering angle.

The quantity is known as the Compton wavelength of the electron; it is equal to . The wavelength shift lies between zero (for ) and twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for ). He found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron. Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10,000 times smaller.

&quot;When I presented my results at a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923&quot;, Compton later recalled, &quot;it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known.&quot; The wave nature of light had been well demonstrated, and the idea that it could have a dual nature was not easily accepted. It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered X-ray photons and the recoil electrons. In Germany, Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger independently developed a similar method.

=== X-rays ===

In 1923, Compton moved to the University of Chicago as professor of physics, a position he would occupy for the next 22 years. In 1925, he demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized, a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. William Duane from Harvard University spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton&#x27;s interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried out a series of experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case.

Compton investigated the effect of X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there, General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc&#x27;s research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.

Compton&#x27;s first book, &quot;X-Rays and Electrons&quot;, was published in 1926. In it he showed how to calculate the densities of diffracting materials from their X-ray diffraction patterns. He revised his book with the help of Samuel K. Allison to produce &quot;X-Rays in Theory and Experiment&quot; (1935). This work remained a standard reference for the next three decades.

=== Cosmic rays ===
By the early 1930s, Compton had become interested in cosmic rays. At the time, their existence was known but their origin and nature remained speculative. Their presence could be detected using a spherical &quot;bomb&quot; containing compressed air or argon gas and measuring its electrical conductivity. Trips to Europe, India, Mexico, Peru and Australia gave Compton the opportunity to measure cosmic rays at different altitudes and latitudes. Along with other groups who made observations around the globe, they found that cosmic rays were 15% more intense at the poles than at the equator. Compton attributed this to the effect of cosmic rays being made principally of charged particles, rather than photons as Robert Millikan had suggested, with the latitude effect being due to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

== Manhattan Project ==

In April 1941, Vannevar Bush, head of the wartime National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), created a special committee headed by Compton to report on the NDRC uranium program. Compton&#x27;s report, which was submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Enrico Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235, conservatively estimating it to be between and . He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey, spoke with Eugene Wigner about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible, although he was more conservative about its destructive power than Mark Oliphant and his British colleagues.

The final draft of Compton&#x27;s November report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. He hoped to achieve a controlled chain reaction by January 1943, and to have a bomb by January 1945. To tackle the problem, he had the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley, concentrated together as the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb.

In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed control of the nuclear weapons program and Compton&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory became part of the Manhattan Project. That month, Compton gave Robert Oppenheimer responsibility for bomb design. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs that the Metallurgical Laboratory scientists had devised should be pursued, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built.

When labor disputes delayed construction of the Metallurgical Laboratory&#x27;s new home in the Argonne Forest preserve, Compton decided to build Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear reactor, under the stands at Stagg Field. Under Fermi&#x27;s direction, it went critical on December 2, 1942. Compton arranged for Mallinckrodt to undertake the purification of uranium ore, and with DuPont to build the plutonium semi-works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

A major crisis for the plutonium program occurred in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè&#x27;s group confirmed that plutonium created in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.
Compton was at the Hanford site in September 1944 to watch the first reactor being brought online. The first batch of uranium slugs was fed into Reactor B at Hanford in November 1944, and shipments of plutonium to Los Alamos began in February 1945. Throughout the war, Compton would remain a prominent scientific adviser and administrator. In 1945, he served, along with Lawrence, Oppenheimer, and Fermi, on the Scientific Panel that recommended military use of the atomic bomb against Japan. He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his services to the Manhattan Project.

== Return to Washington University ==
After the war ended, Compton resigned his chair as Charles H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago and returned to Washington University in St. Louis, where he was inaugurated as the university&#x27;s ninth chancellor in 1946. During Compton&#x27;s time as chancellor, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952, named its first female full professor, and enrolled record numbers of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States. His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university. Despite Compton&#x27;s accomplishments, he was criticized then, and subsequently by historians, for moving too slowly toward full racial integration, making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in St. Louis to open its doors to African Americans.

Compton retired as chancellor in 1954, but remained on the faculty as Distinguished Service Professor of Natural Philosophy until his retirement from the full-time faculty in 1961. In retirement he wrote &quot;Atomic Quest&quot;, a personal account of his role in the Manhattan Project, which was published in 1956.

== Philosophy ==
Compton was one of a handful of scientists and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat paradox, which was published in 1935.

Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of people&#x27;s actions, Compton clarified the two-stage nature of his idea in an &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of choice.

==Religious views==
Compton was a Presbyterian. His father Elias was an ordained Presbyterian minister.

Compton lectured on a &quot;Man&#x27;s Place in God&#x27;s World&quot; at Yale University, Western Theological Seminary and the University of Michigan in 1934–35. The lectures formed the basis of his book &quot;The Freedom of Man&quot;. His chapter &quot;Death, or Life Eternal?&quot; argued for Christian immortality and quoted verses from the Bible. From 1948 to 1962, Compton was an elder of the Second Presbyterian Church in St. Louis. In his later years, he co-authored the book &quot;Man&#x27;s Destiny in Eternity&quot;. Compton set Jesus as the center of his faith in God&#x27;s eternal plan. He once commented that he could see Jesus&#x27; spirit at work in the world as an aspect of God alive in men and women.

== Death and legacy ==

Compton died in Berkeley, California, from a cerebral hemorrhage on March 15, 1962. He was outlived by his wife (who died in 1980) and sons. Compton is buried in the Wooster Cemetery in Wooster, Ohio. Before his death, he was professor-at-large at the University of California, Berkeley for spring 1962.

Compton received many awards in his lifetime, including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927, the Matteucci Gold Medal in 1930, the Royal Society&#x27;s Hughes Medal and the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Franklin Medal in 1940. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1925, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1927, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928. He is commemorated in various ways. Compton crater on the Moon is co-named for Compton and his brother Karl. The physics research building at Washington University in St Louis is named in his honor, as is the university&#x27;s top fellowship for undergraduate students studying math, physics, or planetary science. Compton invented a more gentle, elongated, and ramped version of the speed bump called the &quot;Holly hump&quot;, many of which are on the roads of the Washington University campus. The University of Chicago remembered Compton and his achievements by dedicating the Arthur H. Compton House in his honor. It is now listed as a National Historic Landmark. Compton also has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. NASA&#x27;s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was named in honor of Compton. The Compton effect is central to the gamma ray detection instruments aboard the observatory.

<doc id="432001" wikidata="Q1424696" url="?curid=432001" title="Nose art">
<text>Nose art is a decorative painting or design on the fuselage of an aircraft, usually on the front fuselage.

While begun for practical reasons of identifying friendly units, the practice evolved to express the individuality often constrained by the uniformity of the military, to evoke memories of home and peacetime life, and as a kind of psychological protection against the stresses of war and the probability of death. The appeal, in part, came from nose art not being officially approved, even when the regulations against it were not enforced.

Because of its individual and unofficial nature, it is considered folk art, inseparable from work as well as representative of a group. It can also be compared to sophisticated graffiti. In both cases, the artist is often anonymous, and the art itself is ephemeral. In addition, it relies on materials immediately available.

Nose art is largely a military tradition, but civilian airliners operated by the Virgin Group feature &quot;Virgin Girls&quot; on the nose as part of their livery. In a broad sense, the tail art of several airlines such as the Eskimo of Alaska Airlines can be called &quot;nose art&quot;, as are the tail markings of present-day U.S. Navy squadrons. There were exceptions, including the VIII Bomber Command, 301st Bomb Group B-17F &quot;Whizzer&quot;, which had its girl-riding-a-bomb on the dorsal fin.

==History==

Placing personalized decorations on fighting aircraft began with Italian and German pilots. The first recorded example was a sea monster painted on an Italian flying boat in 1913. This was followed by the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the propeller&#x27;s spinner begun by German pilots in World War I. What is perhaps the most famous of all nose art, the shark-face insignia later made famous by the First American Volunteer Group (AVG) Flying Tigers, first appeared in World War I on a British Sopwith Dolphin and a German Roland C.II, though often with an effect more comical than menacing. The (&quot;prancing horse&quot;) of the Italian ace Francesco Baracca was another well-known image.

===World War I===
World War I nose art was usually embellished or extravagant squadron insignia. This followed the official policy established by the American Expeditionary Forces&#x27; Chief of the Air Service, Brigadier General Benjamin Foulois, on 6 May 1918, requiring the creation of distinct, readily identifiable squadron insignia. World War I examples include the &quot;Hat in the Ring&quot; of the American 94th Aero Squadron (attributed to Lt. Johnny Wentworth) and the &quot;Kicking Mule&quot; of the 95th Aero Squadron. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather by ground crews.

===World War II===
True nose art appeared during World War II, which is considered by many observers to be the golden age of the genre, with both Axis and Allied pilots taking part. At the height of the war, nose artists were in very high demand in the USAAF and were paid quite well for their services, while AAF commanders tolerated nose art in an effort to boost aircrew morale. The U.S. Navy, by contrast, prohibited nose art, the most extravagant being limited to a few simply-lettered names, while nose art was uncommon in the Royal Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force. The work was done by professional civilian artists as well as talented amateur servicemen. In 1941, for instance, the 39th Pursuit Squadron commissioned a Bell Aircraft artist to design and paint the &quot;Cobra in the Clouds&quot; logo on their aircraft.
Perhaps the most enduring nose art of World War II was the shark-face motif, which first appeared on the Messerschmitt Bf 110s of Luftwaffe (&quot;76th Heavy Fighter Wing&quot;) over Crete, where the twin-engined Messerschmitts outmatched the Gloster Gladiator biplanes of No. 112 Squadron RAF. The Commonwealth pilots were withdrawn to Egypt and refitted with Curtiss Tomahawks (P-40) off the same assembly line building fighter aircraft for the American Volunteer Group (AVG) Flying Tigers being recruited for service in China. In November 1941, AVG pilots saw a color photo in a newspaper of a shark mouth painted on a 112 Squadron P-40 fighter in North Africa and immediately adopted the shark-face motif for their own P-40Bs. The British version itself was inspired by &quot;sharkmouth&quot; nose art (without any eyes) on the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters of . This work was done by the pilots and ground crew in the field. However, the insignia for the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; – a winged Bengal tiger jumping through a stylized V for Victory symbol – was developed by graphic artists from the Walt Disney Company.
Similarly, when in 1943 the 39th Fighter Squadron became the first American squadron in their theatre with 100 kills, they adopted the shark-face for their Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. The shark-face is still used to this day, most commonly seen on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II (with its gaping maw leading up to the muzzle of the aircraft&#x27;s GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon), especially those of the 23d Fighter Group, the AVG&#x27;s descendent unit, and a testament to its popularity as a form of nose art.
The largest known work of nose art ever depicted on a World War II-era American combat aircraft was on a Consolidated B-24 Liberator, tail number &quot;44-40973&quot;, which had been named &quot;The Dragon and his Tail&quot; of the USAAF Fifth Air Force 64th Bomb Squadron, 43d Bomb Group, in the Southwest Pacific, flown by a crew led by Joseph Pagoni, with Staff Sergeant Sarkis Bartigian as the artist. The dragon artwork ran from the nose just forward of the cockpit, down the entire length of the fuselage&#x27;s sides, with the dragon&#x27;s body depicted directly below and just aft of the cockpit, with the dragon holding a nude woman in its forefeet.
Tony Starcer was the resident artist for the 91st Bomb Group (Heavy), one of the initial six groups fielded by the Eighth Air Force. Starcer painted over a hundred pieces of renowned B-17 nose art, including &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;. A commercial artist named Brinkman, from Chicago was responsible for the zodiac-themed nose art of the B-24 Liberator-equipped 834th Bomb Squadron, based at RAF Sudbury, England.

Contemporary research demonstrates that bomber crews, who suffered high casualty rates during World War II, often developed strong bonds with the planes they were flying, and affectionately decorated them with nose art. It was also believed by the flight crews that the nose art was bringing luck to the planes.

The artistic work of Alberto Vargas and George Petty&#x27;s pin-up models from &quot;Esquire&quot; Magazine were often duplicated, or adapted, by air force crews and painted on the nose of American and allied aircraft during World War II.

Some nose art was commemorative or intended to honor certain people, such as the Boeing B-29 Superfortress &quot;The Ernie Pyle&quot;.

===Post-World War II===

In the Korean War, nose art was popular with units operating A-26 Invader and B-29 bombers, C-119 Flying Boxcar transports, as well as USAF fighter-bombers. Due to changes in military policies and changing attitudes toward the representation of women, the amount of nose art declined after the Korean War.

During the Vietnam War, Lockheed AC-130 gunships of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Squadrons were often given names with accompanying nose art – for example, &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Azrael – Angel of Death&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, &quot;War Lord&quot; and &quot;The Arbitrator.&quot; The unofficial gunship badge of a flying skeleton with a Minigun was also applied to many aircraft until the end of the war and was later adopted officially. In addition, Army and Navy helicopter crews often embellished their assigned aircraft with a wide range of nose art and other personalized markings.
Nose art underwent a revival during the Gulf War and has become more common since Operation Enduring Freedom and the Iraq War began. A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft ladder doors are frequently painted while many fixed and rotary air crews are merging artwork as part of camouflage patterns. The United States Air Force had unofficially sanctioned the return of the pin-up (albeit fully clothed) with the Strategic Air Command permitting nose art on its bomber force in the Command&#x27;s last years. The continuation of historic names such as &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; was encouraged.

In many other cases at airfields throughout the Middle East during the War on terror, aviation units instead painted the reinforced concrete T-walls and Bremer barriers that protected the aircrews and aircraft with elaborate murals and graffiti.

==Regional variation==

Source material for American nose art was varied, ranging from pinups such as Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable and cartoon characters such as Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Popeye to patriotic characters (Yankee Doodle) and fictional heroes (Sam Spade). Lucky symbols such as dice and playing cards also inspired nose art, along with references to mortality such as the Grim Reaper. Cartoons and pinups were most popular among American artists, but other works included animals, nicknames, hometowns, and popular song and movie titles. Some nose art and slogans expressed contempt for the enemy, especially of their leaders.

The farther the planes and crew were from headquarters or from the public eye, the racier the art tended to be. For instance, nudity was more common in nose art on aircraft in the Pacific than on aircraft in Europe.

&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft did not often display nose art, but there were exceptions. For example, Mickey Mouse adorned a Condor Legion Messerschmitt Bf 109 during the Spanish Civil War and one Ju 87A was decorated with a large pig inside a white circle during the same period. Adolf Galland&#x27;s Bf-109E-3 of JG 26 also had a depiction of Mickey Mouse, holding a contemporary telephone in his hands, in mid-1941. A Ju 87B-1 (&quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; of S2+AC) of Stab II/St. G 77, piloted by Major Alfons Orthofer and based in Breslau-Schöngarten during the invasion of Poland, was painted with a shark&#x27;s mouth, and some Bf 110s were decorated with furious wolf&#x27;s heads, stylistic wasps (as with SKG 210 and ZG 1), or as in the case of ZG 76, the shark mouths that inspired both the RAF&#x27;s 112 Squadron and in turn the Flying Tigers in China, on their noses or engine covers. Another example was Erich Hartmann&#x27;s Bf-109G-14, &quot;Lumpi&quot;, with an eagle&#x27;s head. The fighter wing &quot;Jagdgeschwader 54&quot; was known as the &quot;Grünherz&quot; (Green Hearts) after their fuselage emblem, a large green heart. The Geschwader was originally formed in Thüringen, nicknamed &quot;the green heart of Germany&quot;. Perhaps the flashiest Luftwaffe nose art was the red and white viper snake insignia running through the whole fuselage of certain Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers that served with the II &quot;Gruppe&quot;, and especially the 6. &quot;Staffel&quot; of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 2&quot; in North Africa campaign, the only known artwork on an Axis-flown combat aircraft that could have rivaled the length of that on &quot;The Dragon and his Tail&quot; B-24.

The Soviet Air Forces decorated their planes with historical images, mythical beasts, and patriotic slogans.

The attitude of the Finnish Air Force to the nose art varied by unit. Some units disallowed nose art, while others tolerated it. Generally, the Finnish airforce nose art was humorous or satirical, such as the &quot;horned Stalin&quot; on Maj. Maunula&#x27;s Curtiss P-36 fighter.

The Japan Air Self-Defense Force has decorated fighter aircraft with Valkyrie-themed characters under the names &quot;Mystic Eagle&quot; and &quot;Shooting Eagle&quot;.

Beginning in 2011, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force has AH-1S Cobra anti-tank helicopters and Kawasaki OH-1 observation helicopter named &quot;Ita-Cobra&quot; and &quot;Ita-Omega&quot; respectively, decorated in the theme of 4 Kisarazu (木更津) sisters (Akane (木更津茜), Aoi (木更津葵), Wakana (木更津若菜), Yuzu (木更津柚子)). The Aoi-chan first appeared in 2011, followed by the other three sisters in 2012.

Canadian Forces were reported having nose art on CH-47D Chinook and CH-146 Griffon helicopters in Afghanistan.

==Famous examples==

* Pierre Clostermann&#x27;s Hawker Tempest &quot;Le Grand Charles&quot; featured the Cross of Lorraine.
* Brendan Finucane&#x27;s Spitfires wore a shamrock with a &quot;B&quot; within it. Ireland&#x27;s top ace in World War Two also was the youngest wing commander in Royal Air Force history.
* Adolf Galland was famous for painting Mickey Mouse on his aircraft, and the mascot was adopted by his &quot;Gruppe&quot; during the early airwar phase of World War II.
* Don Gentile&#x27;s North American P-51 Mustang named &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, with an eagle sporting boxing gloves.
* Ian Gleed&#x27;s Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfire featured Figaro the Cat, from the 1940 Disney animated movie &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.
* Erich Hartmann&#x27;s Bf 109s featured a distinctive &quot;black tulip&quot; design on the very front of the cowling, immediately behind the spinner.
* Johnny Johnson&#x27;s Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX featured the Canadian maple leaf.
* John D. Landers&#x27; P-51D, which sported a distinctive black-and-white checkerboard with red trim.
* Ted W. Lawson, who (along with journalist Bob Considine) famously wrote about the 1942 Doolittle Raid in &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, piloted a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber nicknamed &quot;The Ruptured Duck&quot;, after a minor training accident in which the aircraft tail scraped the ground during takeoff; this was decorated by a caricature of an angry Donald Duck figure with crutches and wearing a pilot&#x27;s headphones.
* James MacLachlan, who flew with an artificial arm, had his Hawker Hurricane adorned with a picture of his amputated arm giving a V sign
* Werner Mölders flew a yellow-nosed Messerschmitt Bf 109F-2 while with JG 51 during June 1941.
* Chuck Yeager&#x27;s series of aircraft named &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot;, with bright letter art.

The markings of aces were often adopted by their squadrons, such as Galland&#x27;s Mickey Mouse and Hartmann&#x27;s black tulip (still in use until recently on the aircraft of JG 71 &quot;Richthofen&quot; – not known to be in use on the unit&#x27;s new Eurofighter Typhoons).

==Similar art==
Designs similar to aviation nose art could be found during World War II on some British torpedo boats, and German and US submarines. Similar designs can also be found on some HIMARS-equipped FMTVs in the service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Russian invasion.

==Regulation==
===United States===
In 1993 the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command ordered that all nose art should be gender-neutral.

A 2015 US Air Force memorandum stated that nose art must be &quot;distinctive, symbolic, gender neutral, intended to enhance unit pride, designed in good taste.&quot; Furthermore, it must not contravene copyright and trademark laws.

<text>Bloomberg [[Limited partnership|L.P.]] is an American privately held financial, software, data, and media company headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was co-founded by Michael Bloomberg in 1981, with Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, Charles Zegar, and a 12% ownership investment by Bank of America through its brokerage subsidiary Merrill Lynch.

Bloomberg L.P. provides financial software tools and enterprise applications such as analytics and an equity trading platform, data services, and news to financial companies and organizations through the Bloomberg Terminal (via its Bloomberg Professional Service), its core revenue-generating product. Bloomberg L.P. also includes a news agency (Bloomberg News), a global television network (Bloomberg Television), websites, radio stations (Bloomberg Radio), subscription-only newsletters, and two magazines: &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; and &quot;Bloomberg Markets&quot;.

As of 2019, the company has 176 locations and nearly 20,000 employees.

==History==

In 1981, Salomon Brothers was acquired, and Michael Bloomberg, a general partner, was given a $10million partnership settlement. Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, used his $10million partnership buyout to start Innovative Market Systems (IMS). Bloomberg developed and built his own computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. The Market Master terminal, later called the Bloomberg Terminal, was released to market in December 1982. Merrill Lynch became the first customer, purchasing 20 terminals and a 30% equity stake in the company for $30million in exchange for a five-year restriction on marketing the terminal to Merrill Lynch&#x27;s competitors. Merrill Lynch released IMS from this restriction in 1984.

In 1986, the company renamed itself Bloomberg L.P. (limited partnership). Bloomberg launched Bloomberg Business News, later Bloomberg News, in 1990, with Matthew Winkler as editor-in-chief. Bloomberg.com was first established on September 29, 1993, as a financial portal with information on markets, currency conversion, news and events, and Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions.

In late 1996, Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch&#x27;s 30 percent stake in the company for $200million, valuing the company at $2billion. In 2008, facing losses during the financial crisis, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its remaining 20 percent stake in the company back to Bloomberg Inc., majority-owned by Michael Bloomberg, for a reported $4.43billion, valuing Bloomberg L.P. at approximately $22.5billion.

Bloomberg L.P. has remained a private company since its founding, the majority of which is owned by billionaire Michael Bloomberg. To run for the position of Mayor of New York against Democrat Mark Green in 2001, Bloomberg gave up his position of CEO and appointed Lex Fenwick as CEO in his stead. In 2012, Peter Grauer became the chairman of the company, a role he still holds. In 2008, Fenwick became the CEO of Bloomberg Ventures, a new venture capital division and Daniel Doctoroff, former deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, was named president and CEO, serving until September 2014. At that point, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would be taking the reins of his eponymous market data company from Doctoroff, who was chief executive of Bloomberg for the past six years after his term as deputy mayor.

In May 2022, Bloomberg announced it would launch a new venture in the UK, Bloomberg UK, as part of a wider international strategy. Bloomberg UK plans to hire in the region and has launched a standalone website, a weekly video series, a podcast and new event series.

In August 2023, Michael Bloomberg announced a series of leadership changes for the company, with Chief Product Officer Vladimir Kliatchko assuming the role of CEO and Chief Operating Officer Jean-Paul Zammitt assuming the role of President. He also announced a new board of directors which would be chaired by Mark Carney, taking over from Peter Grauer and that existing board members would move to &quot;Emeritus Status&quot;.

The lawsuit also alleged the company internally investigated Olszewski, attempting to get coworkers to portray her as &quot;flirtatious&quot; or a &quot;sex hound.&quot; Olszewski also claimed that male employees at the company engaged in the &quot;sexual degradation of women&quot; and that the company &quot;took no steps to prevent or curtail the ongoing sexual harassment of female employees by Michael Bloomberg.&quot; Bloomberg, on behalf of Bloomberg L.P., testified that he was made aware of the rape allegation and offered to move Olszewski into another sales unit. Bloomberg also testified that he did not find Olszewski&#x27;s allegation genuine because there was not &quot;an unimpeachable third-party witness&quot; present during the alleged event, elaborating that &quot;there are times when three people are together.&quot;

The case was dismissed by a federal judge in 1999 after Olszewski&#x27;s lawyer had ignored repeated deadlines to submit a response to a motion to end the case. The case was re-opened by another lawyer in 2000, but disappeared from the court docket in 2001.

====&quot;Sekiko Sakai Garrison v. Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg L.P.&quot;====
In 1997, former Bloomberg L.P. sales executive Sekiko Sakai Garrison filed a lawsuit against the company and Michael Bloomberg, alleging sexual harassment and wrongful termination. Garrison alleged that when she told Bloomberg that she was pregnant, he told her to &quot;Kill it!&quot; and said &quot;Great! Number 16,&quot; referring to the number of women in the company who were pregnant or on maternity leave at the time. According to the lawsuit, Garrison told a manager about the incident but was told to &quot;forget it ever happened&quot; before being fired.

Garrison also claimed that Bloomberg told female salespeople to &quot;line up to give him [oral sex] as a wedding present,&quot; referring to a male employee who was getting married. The lawsuit also alleged that Bloomberg berated a female employee who had trouble finding a nanny, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a f------ baby! All it does is eat and s---! It doesn&#x27;t know the difference between you and anyone else! All you need is some black who doesn&#x27;t even have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building!&quot;

The company did not admit any wrongdoing, but settled the lawsuit out of court in 2000.

====&quot;EEOC v. Bloomberg L.P.&quot;====
In September 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a class-action lawsuit against Bloomberg L.P. on behalf of more than 80 female employees who argued that Bloomberg L.P. engaged in discrimination against women who took maternity leave. In August 2011, Judge Loretta A. Preska of the federal United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan dismissed the charges, writing that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not present sufficient evidence to support its claim.

In September 2013, Preska dismissed an EEOC lawsuit on behalf of 29 pregnant employees of Bloomberg L.P. In addition, she dismissed pregnancy bias claims from five individual plaintiffs, and allowed part of the case from a sixth plaintiff to proceed.

====&quot;Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve&quot;====
Bloomberg L.P. brought a lawsuit against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to force the Fed to share details about its lending programs during the U.S. Government bailout in 2008. The records documented Federal Reserve loans issued to financial firms and revealed the identities of the firms, the amounts borrowed and the collateral posted in return. Bloomberg L.P. won at the trial court level. The Second Circuit Court ruled in favor of Bloomberg L.P. in March 2010, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court by a group of large U.S. commercial banks in October. In March 2011, the Supreme Court let stand the Second Circuit Court ruling mandating the release of Fed bailout details.

====&quot;Bloomberg L.P. v. Bloomberg Ltd&quot;====
On October 22, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. applied for a change of name of Bloomberg Ltd, under s. 69(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2006. Bloomberg L.P. then amended its name to Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. Bloomberg Ltd was ordered at the Company Names Tribunal on May 11, 2009, to change its name so as to not have a name that would likely interfere, by similarity, with the goodwill of Bloomberg Finance Three L.P. as well as to pay costs.

====&quot;Nafeesa Syeed v. Bloomberg L.P.&quot;====
According to a recent case in August 2020, Bloomberg L.P. is again being charged with discrimination against black and non-white workers. Nafeesa Syeed, who served at Bloomberg for around four years as a national security reporter and Middle East reporter, sued the corporation in New York city court for sexism based on her gender and her ethnicity as a South Asian-American. Bloomberg faces a related complaint by a former saleswoman, who filed under a pseudonym in June and the corporation is now seeking to compel a public release of her name. Throughout both cases the same law firm represents the plaintiffs.

=== Fossil fuel advertising ===
An investigation by the Intercept, the Nation, and DeSmog found that Bloomberg L.P. is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry. Journalists who cover climate change for Bloomberg News are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis.

===2024 Russian prisoner exchange===
While the 2024 Russian prisoner exchange was still in progress, Bloomberg News broke a news embargo by reporting information provided by the White House. Other publications, including the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, criticized Bloomberg for breaking the embargo, potentially jeopardizing the exchange, and for a Bloomberg editor&#x27;s apparent boasting for being the one to first publish a breaking news story.

<text>Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. (August 17, 1914 – August 17, 1988) was an American lawyer, politician, and businessman. He served as a United States congressman from New York from 1949 to 1955 and in 1963 was appointed United States Under Secretary of Commerce by President John F. Kennedy. He was appointed as the first chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1965 to 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Roosevelt also ran for governor of New York twice. Just after World War II, he served on Harry Truman&#x27;s President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights. Roosevelt was a son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and served as an officer in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Early life==
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. was born on August 17, 1914, the fifth of six children born to Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882–1945) and Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962). At the time of his birth, his father was Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He was born at his parents&#x27; summer home at Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada, which is now an international historical park.

His siblings were: Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (1906–1975), James Roosevelt II (1907–1991), Franklin Roosevelt (1909; a brother of the same name who died in infancy in November 1909, having lived only for seven months), Elliott Roosevelt (1910–1990), and John Aspinwall Roosevelt II (1916–1981).

As a young man in 1936, he contracted a streptococcal throat infection and developed life-threatening complications. His successful treatment with Prontosil, the first commercially available sulfonamide drug, avoided a risky surgical procedure which the White House medical staff had considered, and the headlines in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other prominent newspapers heralded the start of the era of antibacterial therapy in the United States.

===Education===
He graduated from Groton School in 1933, Harvard College in 1937 (Bachelor of Arts), and the University of Virginia School of Law (Bachelor of Laws) in June 1940.

The family thought that FDR Jr. was the one most like his father in appearance and behavior. James said &quot;Franklin is the one who came closest to being another FDR. He had father&#x27;s looks, his speaking voice, his smile, his charm, his charisma.&quot;

==U.S. Navy service==
===World War II===
Roosevelt was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve on June 11, 1940. He was a junior naval officer in World War II and was decorated for bravery in the Naval Battle of Casablanca.

At the request of his father, along with brother Elliott Roosevelt, he attended both the Argentia (Atlantic Charter) summit with Prime Minister Winston Churchill in August 1941, and the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. Franklin also met FDR in Africa prior to the Tehran Conference. Returning from Argentia, he sailed with Churchill and stood with him at parades in newly American-occupied Reykjavik, Iceland to symbolize American solidarity with the United Kingdom.

Brother James Roosevelt summarized &quot;Brud&#x27;s&quot; naval service: &quot;Franklin served on a destroyer that dodged torpedoes from Iceland to Minsk [sic!][He, obviously, meant Murmansk]. He became executive officer of the destroyer , which was bombed at Palermo in the Sicilian invasion. The famed war correspondent Quentin Reynolds went out of his way to write mother how bravely Franklin performed in that bloody ordeal, in which he was awarded the Silver Star Medal for exposing himself under fire to carry a critically wounded sailor to safety.&quot;

Later, as a lieutenant commander, to which he was promoted to on March 1, 1944, Franklin became the commanding officer of the destroyer escort on July 18, 1944. &quot;Ulvert M. Moore&quot; served in the Pacific and shot down two Japanese aircraft and sank the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine . The Moore was in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. James Roosevelt remembered that his brother was known as &quot;Big Moose&quot; to the men who served under him, he did &quot;a tremendous job&quot;.

===Military awards===
Roosevelt&#x27;s military decorations and awards include:

==Career==
===Law practice===
Roosevelt served in several New York law offices after the war. He was senior partner in the New York law firm of Roosevelt and Frieden, later known as Poletti, Diamond, Freidin &amp; Mackay, before and after his service in the Congress. (On December 3, 1945, &quot;Time&quot; magazine announced that Roosevelt had joined Poletti, Diamond, Rabin, Frieden &amp; Mackay.) He triggered controversy for representing Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in the U.S., and dropped the account before Trujillo&#x27;s assassination in 1961.

===Politics===
Roosevelt was also involved in political affairs. He served on the President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights in 1946 for President Harry Truman. Along with his brothers, he declared for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1948, as part of the draft Eisenhower movement.

He joined the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1946.

====U.S. House of Representatives====
Roosevelt Jr. was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives in a special election in 1949, in which he ran as a candidate of the Liberal Party of New York. He was re-elected in 1950 and 1952 as a Democrat. He represented the 20th congressional district of New York from May 17, 1949, until January 3, 1955, then based in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Despite his name and connections, he became unpopular with the Democratic leadership. When brother James Roosevelt was elected to the House, Speaker Sam Rayburn told him to &quot;not waste our time like your brother did.&quot; James wrote that Franklin &quot;had a dreadful record in Congress. He was smart, but not smart enough. He had good ideas and the power of persuasion, but he did not put them to good use. He coasted instead of working at his job, considering it beneath him, while he aimed for higher positions. He may have had the worst attendance record of any member of those days, and it cost him those higher positions.&quot;

====Seeking the governorship of New York====
Roosevelt sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1954, but, after persuasion by powerful Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio, abandoned his bid for Governor and was nominated by the Democratic State Convention to run for New York State Attorney General. Roosevelt was defeated in the general election by Republican Jacob K. Javits, although all other Democratic nominees were elected. Following his loss, Eleanor Roosevelt began building a campaign against the Tammany Hall leader that eventually forced DeSapio to step down from power in 1961.

He again ran for governor of New York on the Liberal Party ticket in 1966, but was defeated by the incumbent Republican Nelson A. Rockefeller.

====Ties to John F. Kennedy====

At the instigation of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., he campaigned for John F. Kennedy in the crucial 1960 West Virginia primary, falsely accusing Kennedy&#x27;s opponent, Hubert Humphrey, of having dodged the draft in World War II.

Kennedy later named him Under Secretary of Commerce and chairman of the President&#x27;s Appalachian Regional Commission. The Commerce post was given to him when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara vetoed his appointment as Secretary of the Navy. &quot;JFK and Franklin were friends and their families were close. Socially, Franklin spent a lot of time in the White House during JFK&#x27;s reign. But when Kennedy was killed, Franklin fell from power.&quot;

He served as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from May 26, 1965, to May 11, 1966, during the administration of Kennedy&#x27;s successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson.

===Entrepreneur===
Roosevelt was also a distributor of FIAT and Jaguar automobiles in the United States. In 1970, he sold the distributorship Roosevelt Automobile Company. He was a personal friend of Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli. He also ran a small cattle farm and had an interest in Thoroughbred racehorses. In 1983, he bred the colt Brothers N Law. A winner at age 2, the New York-bred ran second in the 1986 Empire Stakes hosted that year by the Saratoga Race Course.

==Personal life and death==
Roosevelt married Ethel du Pont on June 30, 1937, in Wilmington, Delaware. They had two children, Franklin D. Roosevelt III (born July 19, 1938) and Christopher du Pont Roosevelt (born December 21, 1941). du Pont arrived in Reno, Nevada, on April 8, 1949, using the pseudonym Ethel Pyle in order to seek a divorce as Nevada law allowed for divorces after six weeks of residency. Roosevelt Jr. was the third of his father&#x27;s children to get a divorce after Elliott and Anna. Their divorce was granted on May 21, 1949.

On August 31, 1949, Roosevelt married for the second time to Suzanne Perrin (May 2, 1921 – December 23, 2022), the daughter of Lee James Perrin, a New York attorney. They had two daughters before their divorce in 1970, which was obtained in Juárez, Mexico: Nancy Suzanne Roosevelt (born January 11, 1952), who married Thomas Ellis Ireland, grandson of Robert Livingston Ireland Jr. in 1977, and Laura Delano Roosevelt (born October 26, 1959).

On July 1, 1970, Roosevelt married for the third time to Felicia Schiff Warburg Sarnoff (born 1927). She was the granddaughter of Felix M. Warburg (1871–1937) and great‐granddaughter of Jacob Schiff (1847–1920). She had been previously married to Robert W. Sarnoff, chairman and president of the RCA Corporation. The marriage was childless and ended in divorce in 1976.

On May 6, 1977, Roosevelt married for the fourth time to Patricia Luisa Oakes (born 1951), the daughter of British actor Richard Greene (1918–1985) and Nancy Oakes von Hoyningen-Huene (1924–2005), and the granddaughter of gold mining tycoon Sir Harry Oakes (1874–1943). They had one son before divorcing in 1981: John Alexander Roosevelt (born October 18, 1977).

On March 3, 1984, Roosevelt married his fifth and final wife, Linda McKay &quot;Tobie&quot; Stevenson Weicker (born 1939). She was previously married to Theodore M. Weicker, the brother of Connecticut Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. They remained married until his death.

On August 17, 1988, his 74th birthday, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. died at Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie, New York, after a battle with lung cancer.

<text>Martello towers, sometimes known simply as Martellos, are small defensive forts that were built across the British Empire during the 19th century, from the time of the French Revolutionary Wars onwards. Most were coastal forts.

They stand up to high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15–25 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360° circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.

The Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful rifled artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.

== Origins ==

Martello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger Genoese defence system, at Mortella (Myrtle) Point in Corsica. The designer was Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino (el Fratin), and the tower was completed in 1565.

Since the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African pirates. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.

Local villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as &quot;torregiani&quot;, who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower&#x27;s roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genoese built a newer generation of circular towers (the Genoese towers), that warded off later foreign raids.
On 7 February 1794 as part of the siege of Saint-Florent, two British warships, (74 guns) and (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under Sir John Moore after two days of heavy fighting. The British forces were helped by the fact that the tower&#x27;s two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire landward.

Vice-Admiral Lord Hood reported:

Late in the previous year, the tower&#x27;s French defenders had abandoned it after (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them. Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But they got the name wrong, misspelling &quot;Mortella&quot; as &quot;Martello&quot; (which means &quot;hammer&quot; in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.

== Design and construction ==

The towers were about high with walls about thick. In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or &quot;terreplein&quot; had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360° arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.
The interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the magazine and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The garrison of 24 men and one officer lived in a casemate on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating. The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water. An internal drainage system linked to the roof enabled rainwater to refill the cistern.
== Martello towers around the world ==

During the first half of the 19th century, the British government embarked on a large-scale programme of building Martello towers to guard the British and Irish coastlines. Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of England. Governments in Australia, Canada, Menorca, South Africa and Sri Lanka also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.

The French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by optical telegraphs (using the Chappe Telegraph). The United States government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.

=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===

Great Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Kingdom of Ireland). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the British Isles as a whole.

This is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of England and the east coast of Ireland, where chains of Martello towers were built. Elsewhere in the world, individual Martello towers were erected to provide point defence of strategic locations.

==== England ====
Between 1804 and 1812 the British authorities built a chain of towers based on the original Mortella tower to defend the south and east coast of England, Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey to guard against possible invasion from France, then under the rule of Napoleon I. A total of 103 Martello towers were built in England, set at regular intervals along the coast from Seaford, Sussex, to Aldeburgh, Suffolk. Most were constructed under the direction of General William Twiss (1745–1827) and a Captain Ford. The northernmost tower at Aldeburgh is of quatrefoil design, i.e. four in one. and there are two towers at Clacton-on-Sea, one near the town and the other to the west near the local Golf Course (see the pictures on the right).

Included in the scheme were three much larger circular forts or redoubts that were constructed at Harwich, Dymchurch and Eastbourne; they acted as supply depots for the smaller towers as well as being powerful fortifications in their own right.

The effectiveness of Britain&#x27;s Martello towers was never actually tested in combat against a Napoleonic invasion fleet. They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling. After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. The Coastguard took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.

Fifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new rifled artillery. During the Second World War, some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for anti-aircraft artillery.

Forty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the towers at St Osyth and Seaford), visitor centres, and galleries (such as Jaywick Martello Tower). Some are privately owned or are private residences, The remainder are derelict. A survey of the East Coast towers in 2007 found of the 17 remaining, most were in a reasonable condition.

Many remaining Martello Towers are now Listed Buildings.

A fuller list of British towers, with photographs, is available.
==== Scotland ====

Three Martello towers were built in Scotland, the first on offshore rocks facing the Firth of Forth in 1807–1809 to defend Leith Harbour. The Tally Toor now lies land-locked within the eastern breakwater.

Two towers were then built at Hackness and Crockness, near Longhope in Orkney. They were constructed between 1813 and 1815 to guard against the threat of French and American raiders attacking convoys assembling offshore. Historic Scotland now operates the Hackness tower as a museum.

==== Wales ====
A small number of Martello towers were also built in Wales, of which few survive. The most notable surviving towers are the two located in Pembroke Dock, which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town&#x27;s riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx. Recently Pembrokeshire County Council has decided to put the tower up for sale.

==== Ireland ====
About fifty Martello towers were built around the Irish coastline, especially along the east coast, from Millmount (Drogheda), to Bray, around Dublin Bay (29 installations) but also around Cork Harbour on the south coast. On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.

Possibly the most famous is the Martello tower in Sandycove, near Dún Laoghaire, in which James Joyce lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with Oliver St. John Gogarty, then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, the fictional character Stephen Dedalus lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi &quot;Buck&quot; Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The James Joyce Tower, as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.

A number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at Bullock Harbour, Dalkey Island, Williamstown, Seapoint and Sandymount and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in Dublin. During the 1980s, Bono owned the Martello tower in Bray, County Wicklow.
Martello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an enfilading tower. The Tower is privately owned and has been fully restored, to include a proofed, working King George 3rd Blomefield 18-pounder cannon mounted on a traversing carriage on the crown of the Tower. There is a three-gun battery below the tower, with a glacis. There is also a coach house, artillery store, tool shed, and gunner&#x27;s cottage, with resident gunner and gunpowder store. The battery, while restored, remains to be armed and the coach house and artillery store still require some restoration.

On the north side of Dublin, one can find Martello towers in Balbriggan, Shenick Island and Red Island at Skerries, Drumanagh Fort, Rush, Tower Bay in Portrane, Donabate, Malahide (Hicks tower owned by Tony Quinn), Portmarnock, Ireland&#x27;s Eye, Howth, and Sutton.

There were seven Martello towers in the vicinity of Cork Harbour of which five are extant. During the 19th century Fenian uprising, the famous Captain Mackey briefly captured and held the Monning Martello tower near Fota Island in Cork Harbour; this tower is believed to have been the only Martello tower ever captured, other than the original. The other Cork Harbour towers are at Ringaskiddy, Haulbowline Island (now part of the Irish Naval Service HQ) and at Belvelly and Rossleague on the Great Island (near Cobh). There are also Martello towers at Little Island and Rostellan, though these are no longer intact.

The British built two Martello towers on the Hook Peninsula to protect the fort near Duncannon, County Wexford and the entrance to Waterford Harbour. There is a third tower on the headland at Baginbun Bay in County Wexford.

One of the most interesting Martello towers is Meelick Martello Tower at Clonahenoge, County Offaly, guarding the Shannon river crossing to Meelick, County Galway. As this tower supports three guns (unlike the normal Martello tower which is circular on plan and carries only one gun), it is cam shaped on plan. Currently a rampant growth of ivy covers the tower.

The tower at Seapoint, County Dublin, which was the property of Blackrock Urban District Council, was formerly the clubhouse of the Seapoint Boat Club from 1916 to 1931, and was subsequently the headquarters of the Genealogical Society of Ireland (GSI). The GSI vacated the tower when it found that the atmosphere was not conducive to the preservation of records.

The restored tower at Ilnacullin is a feature of an island garden in Glengarriff, County Cork. Several other towers are still extant, including one at Rathmullan in County Donegal and two in County Clare on the south coast of Galway Bay in the townlands of Finavarra and Aughinish. There is also an extant Martello tower located near the settlement of Magilligan Point in County Londonderry, built between 1812 and 1871 to defend against a possible French invasion during the Napoleonic Wars; it is now a visitor attraction.

A Martello-like tower was built on Achill Island, according to local memory during the Napoleonic Wars. It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (&quot;French Tower&quot;) or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 Ordnance Survey chart and denoted &quot;Signal Tower&quot;, suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower&#x27;s position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a &quot;watch-house of the coast-guard.&quot;

=== Elsewhere ===
==== Antigua and Barbuda ====

The British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was Barbuda&#x27;s original quay. Confusion with the previous fort presumably explains the claims made in Barbudan tourism publications that this was the World&#x27;s first, and is its oldest, Martello tower, built in 1745. The tower is located on the south coast of the island, a mile or so from River Landing and some seven miles south of the island&#x27;s main village of Codrington. The tower is 56 feet high, has a raised gun platform and extremely thick walls, but is missing the floors. It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by Sir William Codrington, and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral Sir Charles Knowles Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.

It is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a daymark from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.

==== Australia ====
The last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger Fort Denison, built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in Sydney Harbour, New South Wales. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.

Fortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into Sydney Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour&#x27;s inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the Russians during the Crimean War of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.

==== Bermuda ====
There is a Martello tower located at Ferry Reach in St George&#x27;s Parish. The tower is the third fortification on the site. Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822 and 1823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier Ferry Island Fort nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360° traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.

Like its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower&#x27;s purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on St. George&#x27;s Island from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through Castle Harbour and the channel between Ferry Reach and Coney Island. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George&#x27;s, including the Royal Naval Dockyard, on Ireland, the Great Sound, Hamilton Harbour, The Flatts, Murray&#x27;s Anchorage, and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of St. David&#x27;s and St. George&#x27;s Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.

The tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from Fort St. Catherine was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the Bermuda Railway Trail.

==== British Virgin Islands ====

When the British rebuilt Fort Recovery on the west end of Tortola they added a Martello tower.

==== Canada ====
Nine of the fourteen Martello towers built in Canada still survive. (In addition, the existing fortifications at Fort Henry received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions – for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.
Quebec City originally had four Martello towers. Tower No. 1 stands on the Plains of Abraham, overlooking the St Lawrence River. It has been restored as a museum and can be visited during the summer months. Tower no. 2 stands close nearby and currently hosts activities for private groups. Tower No. 3 was demolished in 1905 after being used as a residence. The McKenzie Memorial Building of Jeffery Hale Hospital now occupies the site. The fourth surviving Martello Tower in Quebec, No. 4, is located in a residential area on the north side of the Upper City overlooking Lower Town. It is now used as an escape game tourist activity by The National Battlefields Commission.

Halifax, Nova Scotia, had five towers, the oldest of which, the Prince of Wales Tower located in Point Pleasant Park, is the oldest Martello-style tower in North America. It was built in 1796 and was used as a redoubt and a powder magazine. Restored, it is now a National Heritage site. The Duke of York Martello Tower was built in 1798 at York Redoubt. Its lower level still stands, though it has been boarded up for conservation purposes. The Duke of Clarence Martello Tower stood on the Dartmouth shore. Sherbrooke Martello Tower stood opposite York Redoubt on McNabs Island; it was demolished in 1944 and replaced by a concrete lighthouse at Maughers Beach. Another Martello tower stood on Georges Island.

Four Martello towers were built at Kingston, Ontario to defend its harbour and naval shipyards in response to the Oregon Crisis. Their builders intended for the towers to serve as redoubts against marine attacks. Murney Tower and the tower at Point Frederick (at the Royal Military College of Canada) are now museums that are open during the summer.
Fort Frederick has the most elaborate defences as it includes earthen ramparts and a limestone curtain wall. The Shoal Tower, the only tower completely surrounded by water, stands in Kingston&#x27;s Confederation Basin. Since 2005, it is open to the public as part of Doors Open Ontario for one day only in June each year. Cathcart Tower, the fourth tower, stands unused on Cedar Island near Point Henry.

Carleton Martello Tower, overlooking the harbour of Saint John, New Brunswick, is now a museum and a National Historic Site.

The Canadian Press reported on 16 April 2006 that the Canadian military has named a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Afghanistan FOB Martello. The logo of the International Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum in Kingston, Ontario, features a Martello tower. Since the amalgamation of the Township of Kingston in 2000, the city&#x27;s flag has also borne a Martello tower.

==== Guernsey ====
There are three similar Martello towers in Guernsey, all built in 1804: Fort Grey, Fort Hommet and Fort Saumarez.

In addition, there are a number of earlier towers in Guernsey (the Guernsey loophole towers), that many people refer to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may think of them as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.

Lastly, Bréhon Tower, built in 1856, is an oval tower that represents the final evolution of the Martello tower.

==== India ====

Although European in origin, a primitive form of Martello tower had existed in Punjab by the time it was conquered by the East India Company. There is a Martello Tower that the Portuguese built at the southern tip of the island where the Arnala fort stands. The Portuguese are said to have built many of these towers, but Arnala&#x27;s is the best surviving specimen. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British erected Martello towers at the British Residency in Hyderabad, which were demolished in 1954. An earlier example of such is the one found in Pakur, a town in the state of Jharakhand. This tower was built in 1856 by Sub District Officer Sir Martin with view to protect the British Raj from the Santhals. It was an important position for the British forces watching fighting the rebellion of the Santhals. This example is reported to still be in good condition, but decaying due to a lack of maintenance.

==== Indonesia ====
The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa caused a tsunami that damaged Menara Martello, which the Dutch colonial government of the East Indies built in 1850 on Bidadari Island (Pulau Bidadari), one of the Thousand Islands (Kepulauan Seribu), as part of a set of fortifications built between 1850 and 1852 that protected the approaches to Batavia. Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called &quot;Angel Island&quot;, to honour the leprosarium that had been there.

Other towers were built at Onrust, Kuiper (Cipir), and Kerkhof (Kelor) islands. All four were demolished in part or in whole after the advent of rifled guns made them obsolete.

==== Italy ====

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British &quot;Protectorate&quot; of Sicily after the escape of the Bourbons from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon&#x27;s armies led by Joachim Murat. The new higher rate of fire of ships&#x27; guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.

The Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer W.H. Smyth, who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.
Of the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo, Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at Ganzirri in Messina. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the Castello Maniace in Syracuse.

==== Jamaica ====
There is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in Harbour View, to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, George Nugent, later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of Kingston Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811, at a reported cost of £12,000.

==== Japan ====

* Nishinomiya Battery
* Wadamisaki Battery

==== Jersey ====

The British built eight true Martello towers in Jersey, three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L&#x27;Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:
* Icho Tower (1811)
* Portelet Tower (1808)
* La Tour de Vinde (AKA Noirmont; 1808–1814)
The four surviving, later towers are:
* Lewis Tower (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)
* Kempt Tower (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)
* La Collette Tower – Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers&#x27; barracks and workshops
* Victoria Tower (1837)

In addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the Jersey Round Towers), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may think of them as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.

==== Malta ====

The British never built any true Martello Towers in Malta. However, Madliena Tower, which was one of thirteen De Redin towers built in Malta in 1658–1659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the Victoria Lines. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.

==== Mauritius ====
The British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive.
One tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivière-Noire at Batterie de l&#x27;Harmonie. Cunningham Tower disappeared after 1914. The Tower at Fort Victoria was last mentioned in 1880. In 1865, the &quot;Mauritius Almanac and Civil Service Register&quot; listed &quot;Two Artillery Men, at 1s each per diem&quot;, for the towers at Fort George and Grand River. The Friends of the Environment have restored one Martello tower near the La Preneuse public beach, in the Rive Noire/Black River district. The Friends operate it as a museum for visitors. The original entrance to the tower is raised above ground but a new entrance has been constructed at ground level. The other tower in Rive Noire/Black River district &quot;[L’Harmonie]&quot; still exists but has remained neglected for many years. The other existing tower is at Pointe aux Sables, Grand River North West.
==== Sierra Leone ====
A Martello tower was built on Tower Hill at Freetown, Sierra Leone in 1805 to defend the port from attacks by the Temne people. It was significantly modified in 1870 when it was truncated to allow the installation of a water tank to supply Government House (Fort Thornton) with water. The tower has now been incorporated into Sierra Leone&#x27;s Parliament Buildings.

==== South Africa ====

The British built three Martello towers in South Africa, one at Simon&#x27;s Town Naval base near Cape Town, one at Cape Town, and the third at Fort Beaufort. The tower at Simon&#x27;s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon&#x27;s Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.

That said, Vice Admiral George Elphinstone, who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794. The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.

==== Spain ====

During the last period of British occupation (1798–1802) of Menorca, Sir Charles Stuart, the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D&#x27;Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast. These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.

The British built five towers to protect Mahón: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart&#x27;s Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mahón the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.

One tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the Fortress of Isabel II, built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.
The British erected Stuart&#x27;s Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman&#x27;s Hill to the south of the port of Mahón at San Esteban or Saint Stephen&#x27;s bay on the southern side of the Fortress of San Felipe. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower&#x27;s name was later changed to Torre d&#x27;en Penjat, or Hangman&#x27;s Tower.

To protect the harbor of Fornells, the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor&#x27;s mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.

Lastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of Ciutadella.

In addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier. In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, Gran Canaria, in 1740. At Ciutadella the British used the St. Nicholas&#x27;s Tower, built in 1690. The Treaty of Amiens returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at Son Bou, Menorca. In 1808, Captain Lord Cochrane, commanding the 38-gun fifth-rate frigate , sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower. (Frederick Marryat, later a naval captain and author, was serving as a midshipman aboard &quot;Imperieuse&quot; at the time.)
(This fort has 17 walls.)

There are also four towers on the island of Formentera, and one on the nearby island of S&#x27;Empalmador ().

Another tower was erected by English troops stationed in the fortress of Cartagena, during the Peninsular War. The tower was erected in the center of 1799 fort, in mount St. Julian, dominating port and mouth. In the summer of 1812 English engineers destroyed the fort and erected a tower:

The later constructions that gave rise to the present fortress of San Julián is still in good condition and is used as a base for telephone aerials and antennas. The interior, which is only accessible to technicians, is supposedly well preserved.

==== Saint Helena ====
There is a Martello tower at Saint Helena that was incorporated into High Knoll Fort. The tower was very similar in design to the tower at Simon&#x27;s Town, with a diameter of about and a height of approximately .

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sri Lanka has one Martello tower, located at Hambantota on the south coast, which was restored in 1999. This tower may have been involved in repelling a French attack though there is nothing more than circumstantial support for the notion. British engineers commenced work on three towers to protect Trincomalee but never completed them.

==== United States ====

The United States government built several Martello towers at locations along the eastern seaboard. Two are at Key West, Florida; others were built at the harbours of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Charleston, South Carolina and New York City. Two more Martello towers stood at Tybee Island, Georgia and Bayou Dupre, Louisiana.
Although the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at Tybee Island, Georgia was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and tabby concrete, a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also, unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured gun loops on the garrison floor that enabled muskets to be fired through the walls. It was never tested in battle and by the time of the American Civil War was in a state of disrepair. Its unfamiliar design confused local writers, who often said that the Spanish had built the tower when Georgia was Spain&#x27;s colony.

The Key West towers, though the locals refer to them as Martellos, were square instead of round and had thin walls with long gun loops. In addition, a curtain wall of heavy guns encircled the Key West towers making them, effectively, keeps instead of standalone towers.

A Martello tower figures in the arms of the 41st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army.

<text>The Fresno scraper is a machine pulled by horses used for constructing canals and ditches in sandy soil. The design of the Fresno scraper forms the basis of most modern earthmoving scrapers, having the ability to scrape and move a quantity of soil, and also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually.

== History ==

The Fresno scraper was invented in 1883 by James Porteous. Working with farmers in Fresno, California, he had recognised the dependence of the Central San Joaquin Valley on irrigation, and the need for a more efficient means of constructing canals and ditches in the sandy soil. In perfecting the design of his machine, Porteous made several revisions on his own and also traded ideas with William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, who invented and held patents on similar scrapers. Porteous bought the patents held by Deidrick, Dusy, and McCall, gaining sole rights to the Fresno Scraper.

Prior scrapers pushed the soil ahead of them, while the Fresno scraper lifted it into a C-shaped bowl where it could be dragged along with much less friction. By lifting the handle, the operator could cause the scraper to bite deeper. Once soil was gathered, the handle could be lowered to raise the blade off the ground so it could be dragged to a low spot, and dumped by raising the handle very high.

== Impact ==
This design was so revolutionary and economical that it influenced the design of modern bulldozer blades and earth movers.

Between 1884 and 1910, thousands of Fresno scrapers were produced at the Fresno Agricultural Works, which had been formed by Porteous and used in agriculture, land leveling, road and railroad grading, and the construction industry. They played a vital role in the construction of the Panama Canal and later served the US Army in World War I.

It was one of the most important agricultural and civil engineering machines ever made. In 1991, the Fresno Scraper was designated as an International Historic Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is currently displayed at the San Joaquin County Historical Society &amp; Museum.

<text>On many computing platforms everything is a file, but in contrast in IBM i everything is an object. 

==Overview==

IBM i objects share similarities with objects in object-oriented programming, but there are differences as well. There are similarities in that when storage is allocated for something, that something is of a specific type, and only a specific set of programs are allowed to act upon that object. There are differences in that IBM i objects cannot be inherited, and the set of object types is fixed, and only IBM has the ability to create new ones.

The number of object types is huge and a small subset of them are available to users. The human readable form of the object type is always a three to six character mnemonic preceded by an asterisk. What follows is a short list of the more commonly used objects and their mnemonics:
* *LIB: Library (where everything below, except directories and stream files, is stored; libraries cannot exist within other libraries).
* *PGM: Program (for compiled languages: CL, RPG-IV, C, C++, COBOL, etc. and there are no interface restrictions between the languages).
* *MODULE: Module (linkable into a program from a compiled language above and here too there are no restrictions on linkability between languages).
* *SRVPGM: Service program (dynamic set of one or more modules, akin to a DLL file in Microsoft Windows).
* *BNDDIR: Binding directory (holds a list of modules and service programs and is used when creating programs).
* *CMD: Command (an object used for calling programs that allows users to prompt for their parameters; can be created with the Command Definition language). See Control Language for more information.
* *MENU: Menu (accessed with the GO command).
* *FILE: File (IBM i files can be used for data, input/output devices, and source code, depending on sub type).
* *DTAARA: Data area (small bits of storage used to store tiny items of data for fast access).
* *DIR: Directory (part of the Integrated File System that is equivalent to Unix and Microsoft Windows hierarchical file systems).
* *STMF: Stream file (traditional file that would be familiar to most Unix and Microsoft Windows users and only stored in directories).
* *JRN &amp; *JRNRCV: Journal and journal receiver (used to journal changes to files, data areas, and stream files).
* *USRPRF: User profile (allows users to sign-on to the system).
* *JOBD: Job description (used when submitting/starting jobs).
* *SBSD: Subsystem description (used when starting subsystems; this is the place where user jobs run).
* *JOBQ: Job queue (used to queue up batch jobs to run in a subsystem).
* *LIND: Line description (communications line: Ethernet, token ring, etc.).
* *CTLD: Controller description (communications controller for lines, workstations, etc.).
* *DEVD: Device description (communications device for lines, workstations, printers tape drives, etc.)
* *DTAQ: Data queue (used to queue up data entries for fast retrieval by other jobs).
* *MSGQ: Message queue (used to send message to users, can also be used like a data queue).
* *OUTQ: Output queue (used to queue up output to a printer).
* *USRSPC: User space - a generic data-containing object of arbitrary size (up to 16T).

==Libraries==

A library (*LIB) on IBM i is an object that is used as a system directory to keep track of other objects. Objects are not stored inside libraries, but rather libraries are used as namespaces for objects. Libraries are a &quot;system&quot; object, and therefore only one instance of any given Library &quot;name&quot; is possible. They&#x27;re made to appear as if they&#x27;re stored in the QSYS library.

===Standard libraries===

Generally speaking all libraries created by IBM for use by the operating system begin with the letter &#x27;Q&#x27;. 

IBM Standard Libraries:
*QSYS - System Parent Library
*QSYS2 - System Library for CPI&#x27;s(Characters Per Inch)
*QHLPSYS - Online Documentation Library for Users
*QTCP - TCP Connectivity Utilities
*QAFP - Advanced Function Printing
*QGPL - General Purpose Library
*QTEMP - Job specific temporary Library (deleted when the job ends)

===Library List===

A library list (codice_1) is an object which specifies a default set of locations to look for an object (similar to the PATH mechanism of other operating systems). This object doesn&#x27;t exist on its own and is always associated with another object like a job or a job description (codice_2). Some job descriptions specify the special value codice_3 which means that the library list can be found in the system value codice_4. As of OS/400 V5R1, the user portion of the Library List can contain up to 250 library names. Prior to that it could only have 25 libraries.

A job&#x27;s library list consists of four sections:
* System portion: Always at the top and contains system libraries like codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, etc. The system portion can hold up to 15 library names. The default contents of the system portion are specified in the codice_8 system value. The contents of the system portion can be changed for the current job to differ from codice_8 by using the codice_10 command. 
* Product portion: When a CL command is executed that specifies a production library, that library will be added to the product portion of the library list for the duration of the command. It follows the system portion and the O/S will maintain up to two libraries in it. 
* Current library: Is a special library associated with a user profile and there can only be one in the list at a time. This library is useful for programmers to have their personal library at the top of the list regardless of what the user portion is changed to. It can be changed locally using the codice_11 command. To change it for the user on all future jobs use the codice_12 command. 
* User portion: The last part of the library list that contains all of the application libraries. The list is normally assigned to the job from the job description but for batch jobs this can be overridden using the codice_13 command&#x27;s codice_14 parameter. A job&#x27;s library list can be changed locally with the codice_15(Edit Library List), codice_16(Change Library List), codice_17(Add Library List Entry), and codice_18(Remove Library List Entry) command.
