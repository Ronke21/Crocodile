<text>William Jones (1760September 6, 1831) was an American politician.

==Early career==
Jones was born in Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania. Apprenticed in a shipyard, during the American Revolutionary War, he saw combat in the battles of Trenton and Princeton and later served at sea. In the decades that followed the war, he was a successful merchant in Charleston, South Carolina, and in Philadelphia. He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives in 1800 and was offered the office of Secretary of the Navy in 1801, but declined and remained in Congress to the end of his term in 1803. In 1805, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Secretary of the Navy==
With the War of 1812 raging, Jones became Secretary of the Navy in January 1813. His policies contributed greatly to American success on the Great Lakes and to a strategy of coastal defense and commerce raiding on the high seas. In late 1814, near the end of his term, he made recommendations on the reorganization of the Navy Department. These led to the establishment of the Board of Commissioners system which operated from 1815 until 1842.

==Bank president==
From May 1813 to February 1814, Jones also served as acting Secretary of the Treasury and in 1816 was appointed President of the Second Bank of the United States. He returned to commercial pursuits in 1819. Jones died in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==

The destroyer USS &quot;William Jones&quot; (DD-308) was named in his honor.

<text>The prince&#x27;s wand (also known as a penis plug) is a piece of body piercing jewelry. It consists of a hollow tube with a threaded cap at the end. The tube is inserted into the urethra, and a stem is inserted through a Prince Albert piercing and into another threaded hole on the side of the tube. The general shape is similar to a police nightstick. The little side stem holds the tube in place. The threaded cap, often just a ball, can be removed so the wearer can urinate through the hollow tube without having to remove the jewelry (from the Prince Albert piercing).

Most prince&#x27;s wands are held in place by a Prince Albert (PA) piercing, but any urethral piercing can be used, and some wands require no piercing.

Prince&#x27;s wands are somewhat uncommon, expensive to buy and relatively difficult to manufacture or procure. They are most popular among men who enjoy urethral play. Prince&#x27;s wands require precision measurements of the penis and urethra both flaccid and erect, in addition to the original Prince Albert piercing. 
==Types of prince&#x27;s wands==
There are three basic types of prince&#x27;s wands. The most common, or standard type is the basic &quot;policeman&#x27;s nightstick&quot;. Ringed wands have one or more external rings that are attached to the bead on the outside stem of the wand that passes through the PA piercing, and encircle the penis. Finally, pinless wands do not require a PA piercing to wear, as they have no stem to insert through a piercing. 

Rarer features include more than one stem, e.g. two opposite ones for an ampallang or an apadravya or multiple stems for more than one piercing, and various attachments to the external beads.

<doc id="440723" wikidata="Q7390449" url="?curid=440723" title="SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, Iraq 1973–1990">
<text>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, Arms Transfers Database contains information on all international transfers of major weapons (including sales, gifts and production under licence) to states, international organizations and armed non-state groups since 1950. It is the only publicly available resource providing consistent data on arms transfers for this length of time. The database can be used to track transfers of major weapons and to answer such questions as:

* Who are the main suppliers and recipients of major weapons?
* How have relations between different suppliers and recipients changed over time?
* Where do countries in conflict get their weapons?
* How do states implement their export control regulations?
* Where are potentially destabilizing build-ups of weapons occurring today?
* What major weapons have been exported or imported?

==Imports of conventional arms by Iraq 1973–1990, by source==
Values are shown in millions of US dollars at constant (1990) estimated values. &quot;Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact&quot; includes Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The majority of these transfers came from the Soviet Union, followed by Czechoslovakia.

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) makes the following comment of the methodology of this table:

The SIPRI data on arms transfers refer to actual deliveries of major conventional weapons. To permit comparison between the data on such deliveries of different weapons and identification of general trends, SIPRI uses a trend-indicator value. The SIPRI values are therefore only an indicator of the volume of international arms transfers and not of the actual financial values of such transfers.

SIPRI&#x27;s data are founded entirely on open sources:

The type of open information used by SIPRI cannot provide a comprehensive picture of world arms transfers. Published reports often provide only partial information, and substantial disagreement among reports is common. Order and delivery dates, exact numbers, types of weapon and the identity of suppliers or recipients may not always be clear.

==Arms suppliers to Iraq==
The table shows the majority of conventional arms imported by Iraq during the 1970s, when the regime was building up the armies which were to attack Iran in 1980, were supplied by the Soviet Union and its satellites, principally Czechoslovakia. The only substantial Western arms supplier to Iraq was France, which continued to be a major supplier until 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and all legal arms transfers to Iraq ended.

The United States did not supply any arms to Iraq until 1982, when Iran&#x27;s growing military success alarmed American policymakers. It then did so every year until 1988. These sales amounted to less than 1% of the total arms sold to Iraq in the relevant period. Although most other countries never hesitated to sell military hardware directly to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, the U.S., equally keen to protect its interests in the region, opted for and developed an indirect approach. The CIA began covertly directing non-U.S. origin hardware to Hussein&#x27;s armed forces, &quot;to ensure that Iraq had sufficient military weapons, ammunition and vehicles to avoid losing the Iran-Iraq war.&quot; The full extent of these transfers is not yet known, and details do not appear in the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, which relies entirely on open sources.

In 1996, the Scott Report in the United Kingdom investigated arms sales to Iraq in the 1980s by Matrix Churchill in what became known as the Arms-to-Iraq scandal.

==Table of major conventional arms sales to Iraq by country==
==Political implications==
The Soviet Union and her satellites were the main suppliers of arms to Iraq following the 1972 signing of the Soviet-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. France was another important supplier of weapons to Iraq during the 1970s. The United States, the world&#x27;s leading arms exporter, did not have normal relations with Iraq from 1967 (due to the Six-Day War) until 1984.

Soviet-Iraqi relations suffered strains in the late 1970s. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, the Soviet Union cut off weapons sales to Iraq and did not resume them until 1982. During the war, the People&#x27;s Republic of China became a major new source of weapons for Iraq, with increasing sales from France, the U.K. and Egypt.

<doc id="440753" wikidata="Q7309623" url="?curid=440753" title="Regular temperament">
<text>A regular temperament is any tempered system of musical tuning such that each frequency ratio is obtainable as a product of powers of a finite number of generators, or generating frequency ratios. For instance, in 12-TET, the system of music most commonly used in the Western world, the generator is a tempered fifth (700 cents), which is the basis behind the circle of fifths.

When only two generators are needed, with one of them the octave, this is sometimes called a &quot;linear temperament&quot;. The best-known example of linear temperaments are meantone temperaments, where the generating intervals are usually given in terms of a slightly flattened fifth and the octave. Other linear temperaments include the schismatic temperament of Hermann von Helmholtz and miracle temperament.

== Mathematical description ==

If the generators are all the prime numbers up to a given prime &quot;p&quot;, we have what is called &quot;p&quot;-limit just intonation. Sometimes some irrational number close to one of these primes is substituted (an example of tempering) to favour other primes, as in twelve tone equal temperament where 3 is tempered to 2 to favour 2, or in quarter-comma meantone where 3 is tempered to 2 to favor 2 and 5.

In mathematical terminology, the products of these generators define a free abelian group. The number of independent generators is the rank of an abelian group. The rank-one tuning systems are equal temperaments, all of which can be spanned with only a single generator, though they don&#x27;t have to be integer-based equal temperaments. The non-octave scales of Wendy Carlos, such as the Alpha scale, use one generator that does not stack up to the octave. A rank-two temperament has two generators; hence, meantone is a rank-2 temperament. For the case of quarter-comma meantone, these may be chosen as formula_1 and formula_2.

In studying regular temperaments, it can be useful to regard the temperament as having a map from &quot;p&quot;-limit just intonation (for some prime &quot;p&quot;) to the set of tempered intervals. To properly classify a temperament&#x27;s dimensionality one must determine how many of the given generators are independent, because its description may contain redundancies. Another way of considering this problem is that the rank of a temperament should be the rank of its image under this map.

For instance, a harpsichord tuner it might think of quarter-comma meantone tuning as having three generators—the octave, the just major third (5:4) and the quarter-comma tempered fifth—but because four consecutive tempered fifths produces a just major third, the major third is redundant, reducing it to a rank-two temperament.

Other methods of linear and multilinear algebra can be applied to the map. For instance, a map&#x27;s kernel (otherwise known as &quot;nullspace&quot;) consists of &quot;p&quot;-limit intervals called commas, which are a property useful in describing temperaments.

<doc id="440760" wikidata="Q656260" url="?curid=440760" title="Mars 96">
<text>Mars 96 (sometimes called Mars-8) was a failed Mars mission launched in 1996 to investigate Mars by the Russian Space Forces and not directly related to the Soviet Mars probe program of the same name. After failure of the second fourth-stage burn, the probe assembly re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, breaking up over a long portion of the Pacific Ocean, Chile, and Bolivia. The &quot;Mars 96&quot; spacecraft was based on the Phobos probes launched to Mars in 1988. They were of a new design at the time and both ultimately failed. For the &quot;Mars 96&quot; mission the designers believed they had corrected the flaws of the Phobos probes, but the value of their improvements was never demonstrated due to the destruction of the probe during the launch phase.

== History ==
Mars 96, the only Soviet/Russian lunar or planetary probe in the 1990s, was an ambitious mission to investigate the evolution of the Martian atmosphere, its surface, and its interior. Originally planned as two spacecraft, Mars 94 and Mars 96, the missions were delayed and became Mars 96 and Mars 98. Subsequently Mars 98 was cancelled leaving Mars 96 as the first Russian deep space mission beyond Earth orbit since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The entire spacecraft comprised an orbiter, two small autonomous stations, and two independent penetrators.

It was, however, a very ambitious mission and the heaviest interplanetary probe launched up to that time. The mission included a large complement of instruments provided by France, Germany, other European countries and the United States. Similar instruments have since been flown on Mars Express, launched in 2003. Its project scientist was Alexander Zakharov.

== Scientific goals ==
&quot;Mars 96&quot; was intended to improve our understanding of Mars. The scientific goal of the mission was to study the evolutionary history of the planet&#x27;s surface, atmosphere, and inner structure. Other studies during cruise, such as astrophysical studies were to be made. They can be divided into several categories:

=== Martian surface ===
Studies of the martian surface were to include a global topographical survey, mineralogical mapping, soil composition, and studies of the cryolithozone and its deep structure.

=== Atmosphere ===
Studies of the atmosphere were to include the climate, abundance of certain elements, ions, and chemicals such as water, carbon dioxide, ozone, and others, general global monitoring, pressure variations over time, and characterization of aerosols.

=== Inner structure ===
Studies of planet structure were to find the thickness of the crust, study the martian magnetic field, study of thermal flux, search for the possibility of active volcanoes, and study seismic activity.

=== Plasma studies ===
Plasma studies were to study the strength and orientation of the magnetic field, study of ions and energy composition of plasma during interplanetary cruise and near Mars, and the study of the magnetosphere and its boundaries.

=== Astrophysical studies ===
Astrophysical studies were to take place during interplanetary cruise. They included studies of cosmic gamma-bursts and the study of oscillations of the Sun and other stars.

== Design ==
=== Orbiter ===
The &quot;Mars 96&quot; orbiter was a 3-axis Sun/star stabilized spacecraft which was based on the design of the Phobos orbiters. It had a deployable high and medium gain antennae. Two large solar panels were attached to either side of the spacecraft. It also had a jettisonable propulsion unit to be separated sometime after Mars orbit insertion. Two Surface Stations were attached on top of the spacecraft. Two Penetrators were attached to the propulsion unit. It also had a MORION system which was the central interface, microprocessor, and memory system. The orbiter had a total mass, with fuel, of 6180 kg. It had a dry mass of 3159 kg.

=== Surface station ===

Each Surface Station was contained in an aeroshell about 1 meter high and about 1 meter in diameter. Each station had a Station Data Processing Unit (SDPI) for controlling station operations, telecommunications unit with a transmitter and a receiver for data transfer, and a power supply consisting of two radio-isotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), a battery, and electronics for controlling battery charge. Each Surface Station also carried a compact disc which contained science fiction stories, sound, and art that have inspired Mars exploration. It was intended as a gift for future human explorers. The expected lifetime of each Surface Station was one year.

=== Penetrator ===
Each penetrator consisted of two major structures: the forebody and the afterbody. When the penetrator struck the surface the forebody was designed to separate and delve 5 to 6 meters into the surface while the afterbody remained on the surface connected to the forebody by wires. The forebody contained the housekeeping equipment and part of the analysing package while the afterbody contained the rest of the analysing package and the radio equipment. Each penetrator was powered by a Radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and a battery. The expected lifetime of each penetrator was one year.

== Instruments ==
=== Orbiter ===

;ARGUS: The ARGUS platform consisted of two television cameras and a mapping spectrometer. The ARGUS had its own multiprocessor control system, a navigation television camera (not related to the other two), a data acquisition system with a 1.5 Gigabit memory, a thermal control system, and an in-flight calibration system. It was designed to point the instruments attached to it with high accuracy on all three axes.

;PAIS: The PAIS platform was designed to mount and point the SPICAM, EVRIS, and PHOTON instruments.

;HRSC: The High Resolution Stereoscopic television-Camera (HRSC) was designed to make detailed topographical studies and make atmospheric studies of cloud structures, limb brightness, and terminator features. It was one of the cameras mounted to the ARGUS platform. The design was reused in the Mars Express HRSC camera.

;WAOSS: The Wide-Angle Steroscopic television-Camera (WAOSS) was designed to globally monitor Mars over time to make studies of cloud movement, surface changes due to dust storms, and other long-term observations of the surface and atmosphere. It was mounted to the ARGUS platform.

== Planned mission ==
=== Launch ===
The launch was to take place on 16 November 1996 on a Proton 8K82K/11S824F launch vehicle. This is a four-stage rocket in a configuration which had flown only twice before, both times to launch Phobos spacecraft towards Mars in 1988. The first three stages were to burn to fuel depletion. The fourth stage, called the Blok D-2, would then ignite to place it and the spacecraft into a parking orbit around the Earth. Later it was to re-ignite to begin the trans-Mars injection maneuver. After the fourth stage shut-down, the spacecraft was to separate, deploy its antennae, and use its propulsion unit to complete the burn. After this was complete, the spacecraft was to deploy its solar panels and the PAIS science platform.

=== Interplanetary cruise ===
The cruise was to take about 10 months. Two course corrections were planned on the way. Astrophysical studies were also to take place during interplanetary cruise. Mars arrival was scheduled to take place on 12 September 1997.

=== Arrival ===
Four to five (preferably five) days before arrival, the spacecraft was to release both Surface Stations to land at two separate sites in the northern hemisphere. After release, the spacecraft would perform a deflection maneuver to change the orbiter&#x27;s trajectory to a fly-by path in preparation for orbit insertion. At the appropriate moment, with the main engine of the propulsion unit facing the direction of flight, the spacecraft would make a burn to slow down and enter Mars orbit. Initial Mars orbit would have a periapsis of 500 km, an apoapsis of about 52,000 km, with an orbital period of 43.09 hours.

=== Surface Station landing ===
While the orbiter performed the orbit insertion burn, both Surface Stations were to make a soft landing on Mars. Both landing sequences were identical. They began with the craft being slowed down by aerodynamic pressure. At an altitude of 19.1 km, a parachute would deploy, followed by heat shield separation at 18.3 km, and inflation of the airbags at 17.9 km. When the lander, cushioned by the airbags, hit the ground, the parachute would separate. The airbag would eventually roll to a stop, after which both airbags would separate, revealing the lander. The four petals would open and the lander would signal the orbiter when it passed over the landing site.

=== Mars orbit ===
The first task the orbiter would perform after achieving Mars orbit was to receive a signal from both Surface Stations to confirm landing. The window to land the Penetrators would be seven to twenty-eight days after Mars orbit insertion. The primary science phase of the orbiter could not begin until after both Penetrators were released and the propulsion unit was jettisoned.

=== Penetrator landing ===
The landing of each penetrator would be identical. It began with the spinning up of the penetrator for stability followed by separation from the orbiter. The penetrator would fire a solid rocket motor which would begin to drop it from orbit. After 20–22 hours, the penetrator would encounter the martian atmosphere. It then deploys a braking device. When it impacts, the forebody separates and goes in deeper than the main body. It then performs a communications session with the orbiter to confirm landing.

=== Orbiter primary science phase ===
About a month after orbit insertion, after the penetrators have been released, the orbiter would jettison its propulsion unit. The propulsion unit would get in the way of the deployment of the LWR instrument and ARGUS platform and has to be jettisoned before the primary science phase can begin. The nominal mission of the orbiter would have lasted one Earth year. After the propulsion unit was jettisoned, the orbiter had a low power thrust system for orbit maintenance. During the nominal phase a fly-by of Deimos was possible, but a fly-by of Phobos was not possible until after the nominal mission. If an extended mission were approved, aerobraking over a period of two to three months would have reduced the orbital period to around nine hours.

== Mission failure ==
The launch vehicle lifted off on 16 November 1996 at 20:48:53 UTC. The launch vehicle performed properly up to parking orbit. The planned second burn of the Blok D-2 fourth stage failed to take place. The spacecraft separated and then performed its engine burn automatically. Unfortunately, without the fourth stage burn, the spacecraft lowered its perigee back into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere causing reentry. The fourth stage re-entered on a later orbit. There is disagreement between American and Russian sources on the timeline.

=== Conclusions ===
A review board could not determine whether the &quot;Mars 96&quot; crash was due to failure of the Proton-K launch vehicle Blok D-2 upper stage or a malfunction of the &quot;Mars 96&quot; spacecraft itself. The failure investigation board concluded that lack of telemetry data during critical parts of the mission prevented identification of the cause of the failure. The failure occurred at the second ignition of the Proton Blok D-2 upper stage, while the spacecraft was out of range of Russian ground stations. The &quot;Mars 96&quot; spacecraft carried 200 grams of plutonium-238 in the form of small pellets. They were designed to withstand heat and impact and are thought to have survived re-entry. The Blok D-2 stage carried no plutonium. The spacecraft is believed to have crashed somewhere in a 320 km long by 80 km wide oval running southwest to northeast and centered 32 km east of Iquique, Chile. No parts of the spacecraft or upper stage have been recovered.

=== Fate of the plutonium fuel ===
It was originally believed that the &quot;Mars 96&quot; assembly burnt up in the atmosphere and the debris fell into the Pacific Ocean. However, in March 1997, the United States Space Command admitted that it had miscalculated the satellite&#x27;s path of re-entry. &quot;We were aware of a number of eyewitness accounts of the re-entry event via the media several weeks after the re-entry occurred,&quot; wrote Major Stephen Boylan, Chief of the Media Division at the United States Space Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado. &quot;Upon further analysis, we believe it is reasonable that the impact was in fact on land&quot;. &quot;Mars 96&quot; carried four assemblies designed to enter the martian atmosphere, two surface penetrators and two surface stations. These would almost certainly have survived entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The two surface penetrators were designed to survive an impact with the ground. Despite this and the fact that the four assemblies carried a combined total of 200 grams of plutonium-238 for fuel, the Russians have not mounted any recovery effort to date.

== Missions based on Mars 96 ==
A number of later missions, both planned and successful, are based on the technology of &quot;Mars 96&quot;, for example ESA&#x27;s Mars Express (launched in 2003), NetLander (cancelled) and its successor MetNet (proposed for launches in 2016–2019), cancelled. Some of the equipment designs from Mars 96 were used for MARS-500 experiments.

<doc id="440768" wikidata="Q809788" url="?curid=440768" title="Basava Premanand">
<text>Basava Premanand (17 February 1930 – 4 October 2009) was an Indian skeptic and rationalist from Kerala, India. He organised many tours around rural India for the promotion of scientific thinking, exposing alleged miracles and scams carried out by various charlatans and godmen while spreading awareness of dangerous superstitions. Premanand was the founder of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, the convener of Indian CSICOP, and the owner-publisher-editor of the monthly magazine &quot;The Indian Skeptic&quot;, which investigates paranormal claims in India.

==Early life==
In the 1940s, Premanand quit school to take part in the Quit India Movement. With that his traditional schooling ended. His next seven years were spent in the newly started Sri-Steila Gurukula, where the Shantiniketan-Wardha brand of education was imparted. He was strongly influenced by Helena Blavatsky in his early years and in 1976 met the Sri Lankan skeptic Abraham Kovoor during his Miracle Exposure lecture tour in India. Since then, Premanand became a critic of Theosophy, and succeeded Kovoor after he died in 1978.

==Activism==
Around 1975 Premanand started publicly denouncing the Indian godman Sathya Sai Baba, and devoted his life to exposing godmen and paranormal phenomena. He was arrested in 1986 by the police for marching, with 500 volunteers, towards Puttaparthi, the town where the guru&#x27;s main ashram is located; in the same year he sued Sathya Sai Baba for materializing gold objects in violation of the Gold Control Act. The case was dismissed, whereupon Premanand put in an appeal on the ground that spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law, which was also unsuccessful. In 1993, he published his book &quot;Murders in Sai Baba&#x27;s Bedroom,&quot; about the killing of six inmates at Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s ashram, which he claimed was overlooked by the authorities. His allegations against Sai Baba further include sexual and economic offences. Premanand claimed that he survived four murder attempts and bore injuries from beatings for his activism, and was known as one of Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s most vocal critics.

Premanand used his skills as an amateur magician to try to give a natural explanation for some of the alleged miracles of gurus and godmen. &quot;Guru Busters&quot;, the documentary by the British filmmaker Robert Eagle, features Premanand displaying and teaching his own interpretation and explanation for many supposedly supernatural stunts, such as levitation, flesh-piercing and live burials. He took an active part in the &quot;Vigyan Yatra&quot; (&quot;Rally for Science&quot;) organised by Maharashtra Lok Vidnyan in 1982 to popularise science and scientific thinking, as well as in the Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha held in 1987 espousing the same cause. He is also credited with the formation of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (ANiS) in 1989.

On 7 February 1997, Premanand founded the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, which tours Indian villages to spread his natural explanations of gurus and fakirs whom he considered frauds or self-deceived. He was the convener of Indian CSICOP, a Tamil Nadu-based skeptic group which is an affiliate of CSICOP. He was the owner-publisher-editor of the monthly magazine &quot;The Indian Skeptic&quot;, which &quot;publishes articles on the scientific investigation of apparently paranormal occurrences with a special emphasis on cases from India&quot;.

Once referred to in a BBC anti-guru show as India&#x27;s leading guru-buster, Premanand was &quot;honoured by the government with its highest award for the promotion of scientific values among the public.&quot;

==The paranormal challenge==
In 1963, Abraham Kovoor offered an award of INR100,000 to anyone who could demonstrate supernatural or miraculous powers under foolproof and fraud-proof conditions. After Kovoor&#x27;s death in 1978, Premanand continued his challenge by offering INR100,000 to any person who could demonstrate psychic, supernatural of paranormal ability of any kind under satisfactorily observed conditions. This challenge has not been contested and won.

==Death==
Premanand was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and underwent major surgery. He died on 4 October 2009 at Podanur, Tamil Nadu and, according to his wishes, his body was donated to a local medical college. He was succeeded by Narendra Nayak and his property, assets and the copyright of his 26 books were given to The Federation for Indian Rationalists Association.

<text>The ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family (Parulidae). This migratory bird breeds in eastern North America and winters in Central America, many Caribbean islands, Florida and northern Venezuela.

==Taxonomy==
The genus Seiurus is currently treated as monotypic, containing only the ovenbird; it is genetically distinct from all other species in the family Parulidae, probably the first genus to evolve separately from the rest of the family.

Before the recent genetic studies were carried out, the waterthrushes were also included in &quot;Seiurus&quot;; these are now treated separately in the genus &quot;Parkesia&quot; as they are not very closely related to the ovenbird.

The species name &quot;aurocapilla&quot; is a noun phrase, so the original spelling is retained, not changed according to the gender of the genus name; Linnaeus originally named it &quot;Motacilla aurocapilla&quot;, and the ending is not changed to -&quot;us&quot; as commonly cited in the past. Etymologically &quot;aurocapilla&quot; comes from Latin and means &quot;golden haired&quot; and &quot;Seiurus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;seiō&quot;, &quot;to shake&quot;, and &quot;oura&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;.

== Description ==


Ovenbirds are large wood warblers and may sometimes be confused by the untrained for a thrush. Adults measure long and span across the wings. They weigh on average, with a range of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . They tend to be heavier in winter and particularly at the start of their migration. They have olive-brown upperparts and white underparts heavily streaked with black; the flanks have an olive hue. A white ring surrounds the eyes, and a black stripe runs below the cheek. They have a line of orange feathers with olive-green tips running along the top of their head, bordered on each side with blackish-brown. The orange feathers can be erected to form a small crest. The eyes and the upper part of the thin pointed beak are dark, while the lower beak is horn-colored and the legs and feet are pinkish.

Males and females look alike. Immature birds have tawny fringes to the tertiary remiges and sometimes buff-tipped outer primary wing coverts. Most conspicuously, the olive-green tips of the crown feathers, which are hardly visible in adult birds, are far larger in extent in immatures and cover the orange crown-stripe almost or completely.

The main song of the ovenbird is a series of strident, relatively low-pitched, bisyallabic motives repeated without pause about eight times and increasing in volume. Usually, the second syllable in each motive is sharply accented: &quot;&quot;chur-tee’ chur-tee’ chur-tee’ chur-tee’ chur-TEE chur-TEE chur-TEE!&quot; Male ovenbirds utter a sweet chattering song in the air at twilight, after the manner of the skylark, incorporating portions of the main song into a jumble of sputtering notes and mimicry as they dive back to earth. The call is a variably pitched, sharp &quot;chik!&quot;&quot; Some variations recall the common call note of a downy woodpecker. If the bird is excited, it may repeat this call several times. The fight call is a high, rising &quot;siiii&quot;.

== Range and ecology ==
Their breeding habitats are mature deciduous and mixed forests, especially sites with little undergrowth, across Canada and the eastern United States. For foraging, it prefers woodland with abundant undergrowth of shrubs; essentially, it thrives best in a mix of primary and secondary forest. Ovenbirds migrate to the southeastern United States, the Caribbean, and from Mexico to northern South America. The birds are territorial all year round, occurring either singly or (in the breeding season) as mated pairs, for a short time accompanied by their young. During migration, they tend to travel in larger groups however, dispersing again once they reach their destination.

In winter, they dwell mainly in lowlands, but may ascend up to ASL e.g. in Costa Rica. The first migrants leave in late August and appear on the wintering grounds as early as September, with successive waves arriving until late October or so. They depart again to breed between late March and early May, arriving on the breeding grounds throughout April and May. Migration times do not seem to have changed much over the course of the 20th century.

This bird is an infrequent vagrant of Europe, with five individuals reported this century on the Azores and a handful of records in Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain. A live ovenbird on St Mary&#x27;s, Isles of Scilly in October 2004 was in bad condition, and died despite being taken into care. Ovenbirds are also regular vagrants in California.

Ovenbirds forage on the ground in dead leaves, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. This bird frequently tilts its tail up and bobs its head while walking; at rest, the tail may be flicked up and slowly lowered again, and alarmed birds flick the tail frequently from a half-raised position. These birds mainly eat terrestrial arthropods and snails, and also include fruit in their diet during winter.

The nest, referred to as the &quot;oven&quot; (which gives the bird its name), is a domed structure placed on the ground, woven from vegetation, and containing a side entrance. The female usually lays 4–5 eggs speckled with brown or gray. Only the female incubates, for 11–14 days. Young are altricial and are fed by both parents. First flight is at 8–11 days of age.

The placement of the nest on the ground makes predation by snakes, red squirrels, and chipmunks (&quot;Tamias&quot;) a greater concern than for tree-nesting birds. Chipmunks have been known to burrow directly into the nest to eat the young birds. The female can perform a distraction display, simulating an injured bird, when a potential predator is in the vicinity of the nest.

The ovenbird is vulnerable to nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;), which is becoming more plentiful in some areas. However, the ovenbirds&#x27; numbers appear to be remaining stable. Altogether, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

==In literature==
It is the subject of a poem by Robert Frost, &quot;The Oven Bird&quot;, published in his poetry collection &quot;Mountain Interval&quot; in 1916. Robert Bly also makes reference to &quot;the nimble oven bird&quot; in his short poem &quot;The Slim Fir Seeds&quot;.

<text>Amanita pantherina, also known as the panther cap, false blusher, and the panther amanita due to its similarity to the true blusher (&quot;Amanita rubescens&quot;), is a species of fungus found in Eurasia with poisonous and psychoactive properties. 

==Description==

*Cap: wide, hemispheric at first, then to plano-convex, deep brown to hazel-brown to pale ochraceous brown, densely distributed warts that are pure white to sordid cream, minutely verruculose, floccose, easily removable. Viscid when wet, with a short striate margin. The flesh is white, unchanging when injured.
*Gills: adnexed to free, close to crowded, white becoming greyish, truncate.
*Spores: white in deposit, smooth, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid to elongate, inamyloid, infrequently globose. 8–14 x 6–10 μm.
*Stipe: 5–15 cm long × .6–3 cm wide, subcylindric, somewhat narrowing upward, white, becoming slightly tannish in age, stuffed then hollow, finely floccose becoming smooth above the ring, and with small appressed squamules or creamy floccose material below. The volva is white, becoming grey with age, forming one or sometimes two narrow hoop-like rings just above the bulbous base. The flesh is white, unchanging when injured.
*Odour: Unpleasant or like raw potatoes

Other than the brownish cap with white warts, distinguishing features of &quot;A. pantherina&quot; include the collar-like roll of volval tissue at the top of the basal bulb, and the elliptical, inamyloid spores.
Unlike &quot;A. rubescens&quot;, the panther cap does not color red/pink (&quot;blush&quot;) when the flesh is damaged, hence its name &quot;false blusher&quot;. This is a key feature in differentiating both species.

==Distribution and habitat==
The panther cap is an uncommon mushroom, found in both deciduous, especially beech and, less frequently, coniferous woodland and rarely meadows throughout Europe, western Asia in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe and Asia. 

It is an ectomycorrhizal fungus, living in root symbiosis with a tree, deriving photosynthesised nutrients from it and providing soil nutrients in return.

==Toxicity==

&quot;A. pantherina&quot; is toxic; if consumed fresh, it may not be fatal to humans. It can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and hyperhidrosis, which can lead to severe dehydration. 

Varieties &quot;multisquamosa&quot; and &quot;velatipes&quot; are considered poisonous.

==Psychoactive use==
&quot;A. pantherina&quot; contains the psychoactive compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol, two psychoactive constituents which can cause effects such as hallucinations, synaesthesia, euphoria, dysphoria and retrograde amnesia. The effects of muscimol and ibotenic acid most closely resemble that of a Z drug, like Ambien at high doses, and not a classical psychedelic, e.g. psilocybin.

&quot;A. pantherina&quot; is used as an entheogen much less often than its much more distinguishable relative &quot;A. muscaria,&quot; largely due to being less recognizable and far more potent. &quot;A. muscaria&quot; contains a higher concentration of ibotenic acid. While ibotenic acid is mostly broken down by the body into muscimol, what remains of the ibotenic acid is believed to cause the majority of dysphoric effects of consuming psychedelic &quot;Amanita&quot; species. Ibotenic acid is also a scientifically important neurotoxin used in lab research as a brain-lesioning agent in mice. 

As with other wild-growing mushrooms, the ratio of ibotenic acid to muscimol depends on countless external factors, including: season, age, and habitat—and percentages will naturally vary from mushroom to mushroom—with dark brown &quot;A. pantherina&quot; specimens having a greater concentration of ibotenic acid. 

=== Legal status ===
&quot;A. muscaria&quot; and &quot;A. pantherina&quot; are illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the Netherlands since December 2008. Possession of amounts larger than 0.5 g dried or 5 g fresh lead to a criminal charge.

<text>Amoeba is a distributed operating system developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and others at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The aim of the Amoeba project was to build a timesharing system that makes an entire network of computers appear to the user as a single machine. Development at the Vrije Universiteit was stopped: the source code of the latest version (5.3) was last modified on 30 July 1996.

The Python programming language was originally developed for this platform.

==Overview==
The goal of the Amoeba project was to construct an operating system for networks of computers that would present the network to the user as if it were a single machine. An Amoeba network consists of a number of workstations connected to a &quot;pool&quot; of processors, and executing a program from a terminal causes it to run on any of the available processors, with the operating system providing load balancing. Unlike the contemporary Sprite, Amoeba does not support process migration.
The workstations would typically function as networked terminals only. Aside from workstations and processors, additional machines operate as servers for files, directory services, TCP/IP communications etc.

Amoeba is a microkernel-based operating system. It offers multithreaded programs and a remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism for communication between threads, potentially across the network; even kernel-threads use this RPC mechanism for communication. Each thread is assigned a 48-bit number called its &quot;port&quot;, which serves as its unique, network-wide &quot;address&quot; for communication.

The user interface and APIs of Amoeba were modeled after Unix and compliance with the POSIX standard was partially implemented; some of the Unix emulation code consists of utilities ported over from Tanenbaum&#x27;s other operating system, MINIX. Early versions used a &quot;homebrew&quot; window system, which the Amoeba authors considered &quot;faster ... in our view, cleaner ... smaller and much easier to understand&quot;, but version 4.0 uses the X Window System (and allows X terminals as terminals).
The system uses FLIP as a network protocol.

<doc id="440789" wikidata="Q677197" url="?curid=440789" title="Gyrator">
<text>A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless, two-port electrical network element proposed in 1948 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth linear element after the resistor, capacitor, inductor and ideal transformer. Unlike the four conventional elements, the gyrator is non-reciprocal. Gyrators permit network realizations of two-(or-more)-port devices which cannot be realized with just the four conventional elements. In particular, gyrators make possible network realizations of isolators and circulators. Gyrators do not however change the range of one-port devices that can be realized. Although the gyrator was conceived as a fifth linear element, its adoption makes both the ideal transformer and either the capacitor or inductor redundant. Thus the number of necessary linear elements is in fact reduced to three. Circuits that function as gyrators can be built with transistors and op-amps using feedback.

 Tellegen invented a circuit symbol for the gyrator and suggested a number of ways in which a practical gyrator might be built.

An important property of a gyrator is that it inverts the current–voltage characteristic of an electrical component or network. In the case of linear elements, the impedance is also inverted. In other words, a gyrator can make a capacitive circuit behave inductively, a series LC circuit behave like a parallel LC circuit, and so on. It is primarily used in active filter design and miniaturization.

== Behaviour ==

An ideal gyrator is a linear two-port device which couples the current on one port to the voltage on the other and conversely. The instantaneous currents and instantaneous voltages are related by

: formula_1

: formula_2

where formula_3 is the &quot;gyration resistance&quot; of the gyrator.

The gyration resistance (or equivalently its reciprocal the &quot;gyration conductance&quot;) has an associated direction indicated by an arrow on the schematic diagram. By convention, the given gyration resistance or conductance relates the voltage on the port at the head of the arrow to the current at its tail. The voltage at the tail of the arrow is related to the current at its head by &quot;minus&quot; the stated resistance. Reversing the arrow is equivalent to negating the gyration resistance, or to reversing the polarity of either port.

Although a gyrator is characterized by its resistance value, it is a lossless component. From the governing equations, the instantaneous power into the gyrator is identically zero:

: formula_4

A gyrator is an entirely non-reciprocal device, and hence is represented by antisymmetric impedance and admittance matrices:
:formula_5

If the gyration resistance is chosen to be equal to the characteristic impedance of the two ports (or to their geometric mean if these are not the same), then the scattering matrix for the gyrator is
:formula_6
which is likewise antisymmetric. This leads to an alternative definition of a gyrator: a device which transmits a signal unchanged in the forward (arrow) direction, but reverses the polarity of the signal travelling in the backward direction (or equivalently, 180° phase-shifts the backward-travelling signal). The symbol used to represent a gyrator in one-line diagrams (where a waveguide or transmission line is shown as a single line rather than as a pair of conductors), reflects this one-way phase shift.

As with a quarter-wave transformer, if one port of a gyrator is terminated with a linear load, then the other port presents an impedance inversely proportional to the impedance of that load:

: formula_7

A generalization of the gyrator is conceivable, in which the forward and backward gyration conductances have different magnitudes, so that the admittance matrix is
: formula_8
However, this no longer represents a passive device.

== Name ==
Tellegen named the element &quot;gyrator&quot; as a blend of &quot;gyroscope&quot; and the common device suffix &quot;-tor&quot; (as in resistor, capacitor, transistor etc.) The -&quot;tor&quot; ending is even more suggestive in Tellegen&#x27;s native Dutch, where the related element &quot;transformer&quot; is called &quot;transformator&quot;. The gyrator is related to the gyroscope by an analogy in its behaviour.

The analogy with the gyroscope is due to the relationship between the torque and angular velocity of the gyroscope on the two axes of rotation. A torque on one axis will produce a proportional change in angular velocity on the other axis and conversely. A mechanical–electrical analogy of the gyroscope making torque and angular velocity the analogs of voltage and current results in the electrical gyrator.

== Relationship to the ideal transformer ==
An ideal gyrator is similar to an ideal transformer in being a linear, lossless, passive, memoryless two-port device. However, whereas a transformer couples the voltage on port 1 to the voltage on port 2, and the current on port 1 to the current on port 2, the gyrator cross-couples voltage to current and current to voltage. Cascading two gyrators achieves a voltage-to-voltage coupling identical to that of an ideal transformer.

Cascaded gyrators of gyration resistance formula_9 and formula_10 are equivalent to a transformer of turns ratio formula_11. Cascading a transformer and a gyrator, or equivalently cascading three gyrators produces a single gyrator of gyration resistance formula_12.

From the point of view of network theory, transformers are redundant when gyrators are available. Anything that can be built from resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers and gyrators, can also be built using just resistors, gyrators and inductors (or capacitors).

===Magnetic circuit analogy===
In the two-gyrator equivalent circuit for a transformer, described above, the gyrators may be identified with the transformer windings, and the loop connecting the gyrators with the transformer magnetic core. The electric current around the loop then corresponds to the rate-of-change of magnetic flux through the core, and the electromotive force (EMF) in the loop due to each gyrator corresponds to the magnetomotive force (MMF) in the core due to each winding.

The gyration resistances are in the same ratio as the winding turn-counts, but collectively of no particular magnitude. So, choosing an arbitrary conversion factor of formula_13 ohms per turn, a loop EMF formula_14 is related to a core MMF formula_15 by

: formula_16

and the loop current formula_17 is related to the core flux-rate formula_18 by

: formula_19

The core of a real, non-ideal, transformer has finite permeance formula_20 (non-zero reluctance formula_21), such that the flux and total MMF satisfy

: formula_22

which means that in the gyrator loop

: formula_23

corresponding to the introduction of a series capacitor

: formula_24

in the loop. This is Buntenbach&#x27;s capacitance–permeance analogy, or the gyrator–capacitor model of magnetic circuits.

== Application ==
===Simulated inductor===

A gyrator can be used to transform a load capacitance into an inductance. At low frequencies and low powers, the behaviour of the gyrator can be reproduced by a small op-amp circuit. This supplies a means of providing an inductive element in a small electronic circuit or integrated circuit. Before the invention of the transistor, coils of wire with large inductance might be used in electronic filters. An inductor can be replaced by a much smaller assembly containing a capacitor, operational amplifiers or transistors, and resistors. This is especially useful in integrated circuit technology.

==== Operation ====

In the circuit shown, one port of the gyrator is between the input terminal and ground, while the other port is terminated with the capacitor. The circuit works by inverting and multiplying the effect of the capacitor in an RC differentiating circuit, where the voltage across the resistor &quot;R&quot; behaves through time in the same manner as the voltage across an inductor. The op-amp follower buffers this voltage and applies it back to the input through the resistor &quot;RL&quot;. The desired effect is an impedance of the form of an ideal inductor &quot;L&quot; with a series resistance &quot;RL&quot;:
formula_25

From the diagram, the input impedance of the op-amp circuit is
formula_26

With &quot;RLRC&quot; = &quot;L&quot;, it can be seen that the impedance of the simulated inductor is the desired impedance in parallel with the impedance of the RC circuit. In typical designs, &quot;R&quot; is chosen to be sufficiently large such that the first term dominates; thus, the RC circuit&#x27;s effect on input impedance is negligible:

formula_27

This is the same as a resistance &quot;RL&quot; in series with an inductance &quot;L&quot; = &quot;RLRC&quot;. There is a practical limit on the minimum value that &quot;RL&quot; can take, determined by the current output capability of the op-amp.

The impedance cannot increase indefinitely with frequency, and eventually the second term limits the impedance to the value of &quot;R&quot;.

==== Comparison with actual inductors ====

Simulated elements are electronic circuits that imitate actual elements. Simulated elements cannot replace physical inductors in all the possible applications as they do not possess all the unique properties of physical inductors.

Magnitudes. In typical applications, both the inductance and the resistance of the gyrator are much greater than that of a physical inductor. Gyrators can be used to create inductors from the microhenry range up to the megahenry range. Physical inductors are typically limited to tens of henries, and have parasitic series resistances from hundreds of microhms through the low kilohm range. The parasitic resistance of a gyrator depends on the topology, but with the topology shown, series resistances will typically range from tens of ohms through hundreds of kilohms.

Quality. Physical capacitors are often much closer to &quot;ideal capacitors&quot; than physical inductors are to &quot;ideal inductors&quot;. Because of this, a synthesized inductor realized with a gyrator and a capacitor may, for certain applications, be closer to an &quot;ideal inductor&quot; than any (practical) physical inductor can be. Thus, use of capacitors and gyrators may improve the quality of filter networks that would otherwise be built using inductors. Also, the Q factor of a synthesized inductor can be selected with ease. The Q of an LC filter can be either lower or higher than that of an actual LC filter – for the same frequency, the inductance is much higher, the capacitance much lower, but the resistance also higher. Gyrator inductors typically have higher accuracy than physical inductors, due to the lower cost of precision capacitors than inductors.

Energy storage. Simulated inductors do not have the inherent energy storing properties of the real inductors and this limits the possible power applications. The circuit cannot respond like a real inductor to sudden input changes (it does not produce a high-voltage back EMF); its voltage response is limited by the power supply. Since gyrators use active circuits, they only function as a gyrator within the power supply range of the active element. Hence gyrators are usually not very useful for situations requiring simulation of the &#x27;flyback&#x27; property of inductors, where a large voltage spike is caused when current is interrupted. A gyrator&#x27;s transient response is limited by the bandwidth of the active device in the circuit and by the power supply.

Externalities. Simulated inductors do not react to external magnetic fields and permeable materials the same way that real inductors do. They also don&#x27;t create magnetic fields (and induce currents in external conductors) the same way that real inductors do. This limits their use in applications such as sensors, detectors and transducers.

Grounding. The fact that one side of the simulated inductor is grounded restricts the possible applications (real inductors are floating). This limitation may preclude its use in some low-pass and notch filters. However the gyrator can be used in a floating configuration with another gyrator so long as the floating &quot;grounds&quot; are tied together. This allows for a floating gyrator, but the inductance simulated across the input terminals of the gyrator pair must be cut in half for each gyrator to ensure that the desired inductance is met (the impedance of inductors in series adds together). This is not typically done as it requires even more components than in a standard configuration and the resulting inductance is a result of two simulated inductors, each with half of the desired inductance.

==== Applications ====

The primary application for a gyrator is to reduce the size and cost of a system by removing the need for bulky, heavy and expensive inductors. For example, RLC bandpass filter characteristics can be realized with capacitors, resistors and operational amplifiers without using inductors. Thus graphic equalizers can be achieved with capacitors, resistors and operational amplifiers without using inductors because of the invention of the gyrator.

Gyrator circuits are extensively used in telephony devices that connect to a POTS system. This has allowed telephones to be much smaller, as the gyrator circuit carries the DC part of the line loop current, allowing the transformer carrying the AC voice signal to be much smaller due to the elimination of DC current through it.
Gyrators are used in most DAAs (data access arrangements).
Circuitry in telephone exchanges has also been affected with gyrators being used in line cards. Gyrators are also widely used in hi-fi for graphic equalizers, parametric equalizers, discrete bandstop and bandpass filters such as rumble filters), and FM pilot tone filters.

There are many applications where it is not possible to use a gyrator to replace an inductor:
* High voltage systems utilizing flyback (beyond working voltage of transistors/amplifiers)
* RF systems commonly use real inductors as they are quite small at these frequencies and integrated circuits to build an active gyrator are either expensive or non-existent. However, passive gyrators are possible.
* Power conversion, where a coil is used as energy storage.

==Impedance inversion==

In microwave circuits, impedance inversion can be achieved using a quarter-wave impedance transformer instead of a gyrator. The quarter-wave transformer is a passive device and is far simpler to build than a gyrator. Unlike the gyrator, the transformer is a reciprocal component. The transformer is an example of a distributed-element circuit.

== In other energy domains ==
Analogs of the gyrator exist in other energy domains. The analogy with the mechanical gyroscope has already been pointed out in the name section. Also, when systems involving multiple energy domains are being analysed as a unified system through analogies, such as mechanical-electrical analogies, the transducers between domains are considered either transformers or gyrators depending on which variables they are translating. Electromagnetic transducers translate current into force and velocity into voltage. In the impedance analogy however, force is the analog of voltage and velocity is the analog of current, thus electromagnetic transducers are gyrators in this analogy. On the other hand, piezoelectric transducers are transformers (in the same analogy).

Thus another possible way to make an electrical passive gyrator is to use transducers to translate into the mechanical domain and back again, much as is done with mechanical filters. Such a gyrator can be made with a single mechanical element by using a multiferroic material using its magnetoelectric effect. For instance, a current carrying coil wound around a multiferroic material will cause vibration through the multiferroic&#x27;s magnetostrictive property. This vibration will induce a voltage between electrodes embedded in the material through the multiferroic&#x27;s piezoelectric property. The overall effect is to translate a current into a voltage resulting in gyrator action.

<text>John Walter Olver (September 3, 1936 – February 23, 2023) was an American politician and chemist who was the U.S. representative for Massachusetts&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1991 to 2013. Raised on a farm in Pennsylvania, Olver graduated from college at the age of 18 and went on to earn a PhD in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later taught chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for eight years.

He served in both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court, being elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1968 and the Massachusetts Senate in 1972. He ran in a 1991 special election to succeed 17-term Congressman Silvio O. Conte, who died in office. He was the first Democrat ever to represent the .

Olver announced he would not seek re-election in 2012 and retired at the end of his eleventh term in Congress. He died at home in 2023 at age 86.

==Early life, education, and career==

Olver was born on September 3, 1936, in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, the son of Helen Marguerite (née Fulleborn) and Thomas Horace Olver. His paternal grandparents were of English descent, and his maternal grandparents were German. Olver grew up on his father&#x27;s farm, where the two tended cows, while his mother ran a boarding house which served families from Philadelphia and New York City. Olver graduated from high school when he was 15 and enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry at the age of 18. After earning his undergraduate degree, Olver went on to earn a Master of Science in chemistry from Tufts University in 1956 and a Doctor of Philosophy in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961.

Olver taught chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for eight years and later resigned to pursue a career in politics. He served two terms as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from January 1, 1969, to January 3, 1973. He later served for nine terms in the Massachusetts Senate from January 3, 1973, until his resignation in 1991 to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
On February 18, 1991, Congressman Silvio O. Conte died one month after taking office for his 17th term. That June, Olver, who had been sworn in for his 10th term in the state Senate a few months earlier, in January 1991, narrowly defeated Republican Steven Pierce in a special election for the seat, becoming the first Democrat to win the seat since it changed from being the in 1893. Olver resigned from the state Senate on June 15 and was sworn in on June 18.

Olver won the election to a full term in 1992. In 1994, the year in which Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Olver ran unopposed. In 1996, he defeated State Senator and future Lieutenant and Acting Governor Jane Swift by a 53% to 47% margin. After 1996, Olver continually won re-election with high margins above 60%.

On October 26, 2011, Olver announced he would not seek re-election in 2012, clearing the way for any potential Democratic primaries due to Massachusetts losing a congressional seat after the 2010 United States census.

===Tenure===
&quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;″s &quot;Politics in America&quot; described Olver as &quot;a staunch liberal who prefers to yield the spotlight to other similarly ideological members.&quot; Olver has consistently high rankings from the progressive lobbying group Americans for Democratic Action, and consistently low rankings from its conservative counterpart the American Conservative Union.

As a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Olver endorsed future President Barack Obama. In a tribute to an outgoing Olver and Barney Frank, Ed Markey remarked that, unlike other elected officials who embraced superficial positions to curry public favor, the two were &quot;happy to tell you [they] disagree with you&quot; if they believed so.
==== Foreign policy ====
Olver was a staunch opponent of the United States involvement in Iraq and opposed a United States military presence in Iraq since the 2002 authorization for the use of force in Iraq. He advocated for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq and consistently voted against proposals to increase funding for military operations and increased deployment. Olver stated that he believed that the United States should seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such as Iran and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy based primarily on military means to create a stable and democratic Iraq.

Olver was critical of the United States lack of involvement regarding the genocide in Darfur. Olver was one of five members of Congress arrested on April 28, 2006, after protesting the genocide outside the Sudanese Embassy. Olver was arrested again in front of the Sudanese Embassy during a protest in 2012 along with other members of Congress and actor George Clooney.

==== Domestic policy ====
Olver co-sponsored which would introduce a universal health insurance program with single-payer financing. In addition to supporting different pieces of health care reform legislation in the House, Olver had also strongly supported allowing federal funds related to health care programs to fund abortion operations. In addition to supporting the inclusion of coverage for abortions in health care, Olver had consistently supported pro-choice legislation in the House and has received favorable ratings from pro-choice interest groups such as the NARAL Pro-Choice America, which gave Olver a rating of 100.

Olver supported efforts to reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States but also believed in immigration reform so that qualified immigrants could more easily be granted entrance. Olver also believed that illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States need to be provided with a pathway to citizenship and that these immigrants should not have to return to their countries of origin before obtaining citizenship.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations

**Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies &quot;(Chairman)&quot;
==Personal life==
Olver was married to Rose Richardson Olver, a Professor of Psychology and Sexuality, Women&#x27;s and Gender Studies at Amherst College, from 1959 until she died in 2014, and they had one daughter named Martha. He lived in Amherst, Massachusetts, from 1963 until his death.

== Legacy ==

On May 4, 2012, a new central bus and rail station in Greenfield, Massachusetts, was dedicated in Olver&#x27;s honor. The building is the first zero-net-energy transportation facility in the nation, generating heat and power via geothermal wells, photovoltaic panels, and sunlight.

On October 27, 2017, the John W. Olver Design Building at the University of Massachusetts Amherst was dedicated in Olver&#x27;s honor. The building was the largest and most technologically advanced academic wood structure in the US upon completion. It was also the first in the US to use a wood-concrete composite floor system researched at the University of Massachusetts.

On October 28, 2010, the veterans&#x27; group Soldier On awarded Olver the Soldier On Award. This award, created for Soldier On by sculptor Andrew DeVries, recognizes individuals whose leadership and actions have advanced the goal of ending veteran homelessness.

== Death ==
Olver died at his home in Amherst on February 23, 2023, at the age of 86.

<text>(also spelled or sometimes ) is the Japanese word for tattoo, and is used in English to refer to a distinctive style of Japanese tattooing, though it is also used as a blanket term to describe a number of tattoo styles originating in Japan, including tattooing traditions from both the Ainu people and the Ryukyuan Kingdom.

All forms of are applied by hand, using wooden handles and metal needles attached via silk thread. This method also requires special ink known as ink (also called ); tattooing practiced by both the Ainu people and the Ryukyuan people uses ink derived from the indigo plant. It is a painful and time-consuming process, practiced by a limited number of specialists known as . typically have one or more apprentices working for them, whose apprenticeship can last for a long time period; historically, were admired as figures of bravery and roguish sex appeal.

During the Edo period, (&quot;tattoo punishment&quot;) was a criminal penalty. The location of the tattoo was determined by the crime; thieves were tattooed on the arm, murderers on the head. The shape of the tattoo was based on where the crime occurred. Tattoos came to be associated with criminals within Japanese society. Two characters in the 1972 film Hanzo the Razor, set in the Edo period, are depicted with ring tattoos on their left arms as punishment for theft and kidnapping.

At the beginning of the Meiji period, the Japanese government outlawed tattoos, which reinforced the stigma against people with tattoos and tattooing in modern-day Japan. Although tattoos are still banned in many public recreational areas today, a 2019 appeal changed the classification of tattoos as decoration instead of a medical procedure.

==Etymology==
In Japanese, literally means &#x27;inserting ink&#x27; and can be written in several ways, most commonly as . Synonyms include , , and . Each of these synonyms can also be read as , a reading of these kanji. Tattoos are also sometimes called which have a slightly different significance.

==History of Japanese tattoos==
Tattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the Jōmon or paleolithic period (approximately 10,000 BC) on the Japanese archipelago. Some scholars have suggested that the distinctive cord-marked patterns observed on the faces and bodies of figures dated to that period represent tattoos, but this claim is not unanimously accepted. There are similarities, however, between such markings and the tattoo traditions observed in other contemporaneous cultures. In the following Yayoi period (), tattoo designs were observed and remarked upon by Chinese visitors in Kyushu. Such designs were thought to have spiritual significance as well as functioning as a status symbol.

However, evidence suggesting a lack of tattooing traditions also exists; according to the early 8th-century , no such traditions of tattooing existed on the ancient Japanese mainland, with people who were tattooed regarded as outsiders. A further record in the (the second-oldest book of classical Japanese history) chronicles that tattooing traditions were confined only to the Tsuchigumo people.

Starting in the Kofun period (300–600 AD), tattoos began to assume negative connotations. Instead of being used for ritual or status purposes, tattoo marks began to be placed on criminals as a punishment.

===Ainu tattoos===
The Ainu people, the indigenous people of northern Japan, are known for their traditions of tattooing, though few Ainu people and people of Ainu descent have these tattoos in the modern day. These tattoos were frequently used for decorative and social purposes, with both women and men being tattooed. Women were tattooed on the hands, forearms, and mouths in indigo to signify moving into adulthood, to protect against disease, and for aesthetic purposes.

==Japanese tattoos in the Edo period==
Until the Edo period (1603–1867), the role of tattoos in Japanese society fluctuated. Tattooed marks were still used as punishment, but minor fads for decorative tattoos, some featuring designs that would be completed only when lovers&#x27; hands were joined, also came and went. It was in the Edo period however, that Japanese decorative tattooing began to develop into the advanced art form it is known as today.

The impetus for the development of as an artform was the development of the art of woodblock printing, and the release of the popular Chinese novel in 1757 in Japan; though the novel dates back several centuries before this, 1757 marked the released of the first Japanese edition. , a tale of rebel courage and manly bravery, was illustrated with lavish woodblock prints showing men in heroic scenes, their bodies decorated with dragons and other mythical beasts, flowers, ferocious tigers and religious images. The novel was an immediate success, creating a demand for the type of tattoos seen in the woodblock illustrations.

Woodblock artists also began to practice tattooing, using many of the same tools they used for woodblock printing. These included chisels, gouges, and, most importantly, a unique type of ink known as &quot; ink&quot; or &quot; black&quot;, which turns blue-green under the skin.

There is some academic debate over who wore these elaborate tattoos. Some scholars say that it was the lower classes who wore—and flaunted—such tattoos. Others claim that wealthy merchants, barred by law from flaunting their wealth, wore expensive under their clothes. It is known for certain that became associated with firemen, who wore them as a form of spiritual protection.

==Tattoos in modern Japan==
Following the opening of Japan&#x27;s borders to the rest of the world at the beginning of the Meiji period, the Japanese government, conscious to protect its image and make a good first impression in the face of its new international status, outlawed tattooing, with soon taking on connotations of criminality. Nevertheless, many foreigners, fascinated with the unique skills of Japanese tattoo artists, travelled to Japan with the express intention of being tattooed there, and traditional tattooing continued underground.

Tattooing was legalized by the occupation forces in 1948, but has retained its image of criminality. For many years, traditional Japanese tattoos were associated with the yakuza, Japan&#x27;s notorious mafia, and many businesses in Japan (such as public baths, fitness centers and hot springs) still ban customers with tattoos. In 2020, the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that tattoos could be performed by people other than licensed medical professionals, a requirement still present in South Korea, after the home studio of an Osaka-based tattoo artist, Taiki Masuda, was raided by the police and the artist was fined. As a result, the Japan Tattooist Organization formed and created a hygiene and safety online course for artists that provides a certificate of completion, similar to practices in other countries.

Although tattoos have gained popularity among the youth of Japan due to Western influence, tattoos continue to be stigmatised throughout most of Japan; unlike many other countries, even finding a tattoo shop in Japan can prove difficult, with tattoo shops primarily placed in areas that are very tourist- or US military-friendly. According to Kunihiro Shimada, the president of the Japan Tattoo Institute, there are an estimated 3,000 tattoo artists throughout the entirety of Japan. Around 1.4 million adults in Japan have tattoos. Attitudes around the acceptability of tattoos vary significantly by age, with 60% of Japanese people in their 20s and younger agreed that rules for tattoos should be relaxed, according to the results of a 2021 survey.

There are even current political repercussions for tattoos in Japan. In 2012, the then-mayor of Osaka, Tōru Hashimoto, started a campaign to rid tattoos from public sector employees, claiming that &quot;tattoos on City workers undermined trust in the City&quot; and threatening to fire any government employee with tattoos. That year, he authorized a survey of all public sector employees asking whether they had tattoos. Multiple city employees filed lawsuits against the City of Osaka after being reprimanded for having tattoos. This survey, along with other tattoo-related policies implemented by Hashimoto, was eventually found to have violated the city&#x27;s privacy protection ordinance by the Osaka District Court. Parties and annual meetings are held by associations amongst those with tattoos.

Modern tattoos in Japan are done mostly in a similar manner to Western tattooing. Unlike traditional , where the design is mostly left up to the artist, customers bring in a design of their choice or can decide on what they would like at the shop. Many Japanese artists are well-versed in multiple styles besides traditional Japanese tattoos, giving customers the ability to select from a wide assortment of options. Modern tattoos are also done via an electric tattoo machine, in which the ink can be inserted into the machine, or the needle tip can be dipped into ink for application. Japanese artists are widely recognised for the quality of their work, despite the relative expense of tattoos, and are highly sought-after.

Despite the majority of modern tattooing being done by needle and machine, is also practiced with traditional tools, though tattoo artists trained in this style can be difficult to find; unlike most Western-style tattoo artists in Japan, the majority of traditional artists are not located in the Tokyo area. Also unlike Western tattooing is the high expense of the technique, as well as the higher proportion of time required to complete one piece and the higher level of pain involved. A typical traditional body suit, covering the arms, back, thighs and chest, with a space left down the centre of the torso, can take up to five years of weekly visits to complete, and cost in excess of US$30,000. The process is also more formal than Western tattooing, with the artist having a greater level of control over the finished design.

==Process==
===Being tattooed===

The process of being tattooed in the style can be difficult and time-consuming. The first step of finding a traditional tattoo artist can be a daunting task, as many tattoo artists in Japan are somewhat secretive in their work, with introductions made by word-of-mouth only, though the advent of the Internet has made finding an artists more accessible.

After an initial consultation during which the client will discuss with the tattooist the designs they are interested in, the work begins with the tattooing of the outline. This will usually be done in one sitting, often freehand (without the use of a stencil), which may require several hours to complete. When the outline is complete, the shading and colouring is done in weekly visits, whenever the client has money to spare. When the tattoo is finished, the artist will &quot;sign&quot; his name in a space reserved for that purpose, most often somewhere on the back.

Wearers of traditional tattoos frequently keep their art secret, as tattoos are still seen as a sign of criminality in Japan, particularly by older people and in the work place. Many yakuza and other criminals themselves now avoid tattoos for this very reason.

===Becoming an artist===

The process of training to become a traditional tattoo artist is difficult and time-consuming; tattoo artists will train for many years under a master, sometimes living in the master&#x27;s house, and may spend years cleaning the studio, observing and practicing in their own skin, making both the needles and other tools required, mixing inks, and painstakingly copying designs from the master&#x27;s book before being allowed to tattoo clients.

Tattoo artists must master the unique styles of tattooing by hand required, and will usually be given a tattoo name by their master, most often incorporating the word (to engrave) and a syllable derived from the master&#x27;s own name, or some other significant word. In some cases, the apprentice will take the master&#x27;s name, and will become The Second or Third (and so on).

<text>Richard Edmund Neal (born February 14, 1949) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 1989. The district, numbered as the 2nd district from 1989 to 2013, includes Springfield, West Springfield, Pittsfield, Holyoke, Agawam, Chicopee and Westfield, and is much more rural than the rest of the state. A member of the Democratic Party, Neal has been the dean of Massachusetts&#x27;s delegation to the United States House of Representatives since 2013, and he is also the dean of the New England House delegations.

Neal was president of the Springfield City Council from 1979 to 1983 and mayor of Springfield from 1983 to 1989. He was nearly unopposed when he ran for the House of Representatives in 1988, and took office in 1989.

Neal chaired the House Ways and Means Committee from 2019 to 2023 and chaired the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures. He has also dedicated much of his career to U.S.–Ireland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues as abortion and trade. In January 2020, Neal was inducted into the Irish American Hall of Fame.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
Richard Edmund Neal was born in 1949, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the oldest of three children of Mary H. (Garvey) and Edmund John Neal. He and his two younger sisters were raised in Springfield by their mother, a housewife, and their father, a custodian at MassMutual. Neal&#x27;s maternal grandparents were from Northern Ireland and his paternal grandparents were from Ireland and Cornwall, England. Neal&#x27;s mother died of a heart attack when he was 13, and he was attending Springfield Technical High School when his father, an alcoholic, died. Neal and his two younger sisters moved in with their grandmother and later their aunt, forced to rely on Social Security checks as they grew up.

After graduating from high school, Neal attended Holyoke Community College in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and then American International College in Springfield, with the assistance of survivor&#x27;s benefits. He graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. He then attended the University of Hartford&#x27;s Barney School of Business and Public Administration, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, graduating in 1976 with a Master of Arts in public administration. Early in his career Neal taught history at Cathedral High School.

==Local government==

Neal began his political career as co-chairman of Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 election campaign in Western Massachusetts. In 1973 he became an assistant to Springfield Mayor William C. Sullivan. Neal was elected to the Springfield City Council in 1978 and was named President of the City Council in 1979. The following year he was named as a delegate for presidential candidate Ted Kennedy at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. While a city councilor, Neal taught history at Cathedral High School, and gave lectures at Springfield College, American International College, Springfield Technical Community College, and Western New England College.

In 1983, Neal made plans to challenge Theodore Dimauro, the Democratic incumbent mayor of Springfield. The pressure led Dimauro to retire and Neal was elected mayor. Neal was reelected in 1985 and 1987. As mayor, Neal oversaw a period of significant economic growth, with over $400 million of development and investment in the city, and a surplus in the city budget. He worked to strengthen Springfield&#x27;s appearance, pushing to revive and preserve the city&#x27;s historic homes and initiating a Clean City Campaign to reduce litter.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

Neal ran for the United States House of Representatives in in 1988 after 18-term Democratic incumbent Edward Boland retired. Boland had alerted Neal of his impending retirement, giving him a head start on his campaign. Neal raised $200,000 in campaign contributions and collected signatures across the district before the retirement was formally announced. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary, and his only general election opponent was Communist Party candidate Louis R. Godena, whom he defeated with over 80 percent of the vote.

Neal has won reelection every two years since. Former Springfield mayor Theodore Dimauro, reflecting sentiments that Neal had an unfair advantage in the previous election, ran as a challenger in the 1990 Democratic primary. Dimauro&#x27;s campaign was sullied by a false rumor he spread about the Bank of New England&#x27;s financial situation, and Neal won the primary easily. He was unopposed in the general election, winning 68 percent of the vote. In 1992, his popularity was threatened by the House banking scandal, in which he had made dozens of unpenalized overdrafts at the House Bank. After narrowly defeating two Democratic opponents, he was challenged by Republican Anthony W. Ravosa Jr., and Independent Thomas R. Sheehan. Neal won with 53 percent of the vote.

In a &quot;Springfield Union-News&quot; poll taken in mid-October 1994, Neal was ahead of John Briare by only 6 percentage points. Neal went on to spend nearly $500,000 in the last two weeks of the campaign to defeat Briare. The 1994 general election also featured a third-party candidate, Kate Ross, who received 6% of the vote. With blanks, Neal actually received only 51% of the vote in 1994.

Since 1994 Neal has had little electoral opposition. He was challenged by Mark Steele in 1996 and easily dispatched him with 71 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in 1998. In 2000 he won the Democratic primary against Joseph R. Fountain, who challenged Neal&#x27;s positions as &quot;anti-choice&quot; and &quot;anti-gun&quot;. Neal had been unopposed in the general election since 1996, but faced Republican opponent Tom Wesley in the 2010 U.S. congressional elections, which Neal won by a margin of 57% to 43%.

For his first 12 terms in Congress, Neal represented a district centered on Springfield and stretching as far east as the southern and western suburbs of Worcester. When Massachusetts lost a congressional district after the 2010 census, the bulk of Neal&#x27;s territory, including his home in Springfield, was merged with the 1st district, held by fellow Democrat John Olver. While it retained Olver&#x27;s district number, it was geographically and demographically more Neal&#x27;s district; it now covered almost all of the Springfield metropolitan area. The prospect of an incumbent vs. incumbent contest was averted when Olver retired. The new 1st was no less Democratic than the old 2nd, and Neal was reelected without much difficulty in 2012, 2014 and 2016.

In the 2018 Democratic primary, Neal defeated Springfield attorney Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, 70.7% to 29.3%. In the final days of the campaign Neal had $3.1 million in the bank to Amatul-Wadud&#x27;s $20,000.

Holyoke mayor Alex Morse unsuccessfully challenged Neal in the 2020 Democratic primary election. In the 2020 election, Neal received the most PAC money of any candidate: $3.1 million out of his $4.9 million total raised.

====Electoral history====
===Tenure===

Neal has a generally liberal political record. He was given a 100 percent &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; by Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) for his 2008 voting record, and the organization named him one of the year&#x27;s &quot;ADA Heroes&quot;. He was given an 8.19 percent &quot;Lifetime Rating&quot; by the American Conservative Union (ACU) based on his votes from 1989 to 2009. In the 110th United States Congress Neal voted with the Democratic Party leadership on 98.9 percent of bills; in the 111th United States Congress, Neal voted with the Democratic party leadership 95% of the time.

Neal voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

Neal served as a member of the House Democratic Steering Committee in the 105th Congress and was an at-large whip for the House Democrats. He is a co-chair of the New England Congressional Caucus, a group aiming to advance the regional interests of New England.

====Economy and budget====
With several committee posts, Neal has made economic policy the focus of his career, although his success has been mixed. He served his first two terms on the House Banking Committee, where he served on the Financial Services Subcommittee. As the banking reform law of 1991 was being drafted, he cautioned that President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s proposal could negatively affect small businesses and minority-owned businesses. He introduced an amendment to require reports on lending to these businesses, which was adopted.

In 1993 Neal moved to the House Ways and Means Committee, where he currently serves. He has been chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures since 2008 and is a member of the Subcommittee on Trade. Previously he served on the Oversight and Social Security subcommittees. In the late 2000s analysts considered Neal a likely frontrunner for chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and in the wake of Charles B. Rangel&#x27;s 2010 departure he began actively seeking the post. In June 2010, while pursuing the chairmanship, he invited campaign contributors to a $5,000-per-person weekend fundraiser in Cape Cod. This drew fire from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, which criticized him for &quot;[acceding] to the capital&#x27;s money culture.&quot;

According to Congressional Quarterly&#x27;s &quot;Politics in America&quot;, one of Neal&#x27;s longstanding legislative priorities is to simplify the tax code. Neal has long advocated repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), believing its effects have reached unreasonably low income brackets. He led an unsuccessful movement to reform the AMT in 2007. In 1998 he successfully pushed to exempt a child tax credit from being affected by the AMT, and in 2001 Congress made the exemption permanent at his urging. He voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, saying they would force millions onto the AMT. Another priority of Neal&#x27;s is to eliminate tax &quot;loopholes&quot; that favor higher-income individuals. He was the lead proponent of a bill to require federal contractors to pay federal taxes for workers hired through offshore shell headquarters. The bill, H.R. 6081, passed both houses of Congress unanimously and was signed into law in May 2008.

On trade policy, Neal has a moderate record, supporting lower trade barriers. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. In 1995 and 2002 he voted against fast track bills that gave the president the authority to negotiate trade deals without amendments by Congress. In 2007 he voted in favor of the United States – Peru Trade Promotion Agreement despite some Democratic opposition.

Neal is a strong supporter of the Social Security program. He moved from the Trade subcommittee to the Social Security subcommittee in 2005 to challenge President George W. Bush&#x27;s attempts to partially privatize it. He pushed a proposal to automatically enroll employees in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and successfully lobbied President Barack Obama to include it in a proposed 2009 budget outline.

In February 2019, Neal came under criticism for failing to promptly exercise his authority as Ways and Means Committee chair to subpoena Donald Trump&#x27;s tax returns. Citing a need to build a strong case in a potential lawsuit, Neal delayed taking this step until May 2019.

In 2019 the House Ways and Means Committee led by Neal passed a bill that would prohibit the IRS from creating a free electronic tax filing system. During his 2016 and 2018 campaigns, Neal received $16,000 in contributions from Intuit and H&amp;R Block, two tax preparation companies that have lobbied against the creation of free tax filing systems.

For his tenure as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 116th Congress, Neal earned an &quot;F&quot; grade from the non-partisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

====Foreign policy====
Descended from Irish nationalist grandparents on both sides, Neal has been an advocate for Irish concerns throughout his Congressional career, pushing to keep the United States involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. He is the co-chair of the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Committee on Irish Affairs, has been chairman of the Friends of Ireland since 2007, and was considered as a candidate for United States Ambassador to Ireland in 1998. After the disarmament of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in September 2005, Neal was among a group of Congressmen who met with Sinn Féin MP Martin McGuinness to congratulate him on the disarmament and ensure a lasting peace had been reached. Neal invited Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams to the inauguration of Barack Obama in January 2009. Neal has been named as one of the top 100 Irish-Americans by &quot;Irish America&quot; magazine and received the International Leadership Award from The American Ireland Fund in 2002.

Neal is an opponent of the Iraq War, saying it was based on false intelligence. He voted against the original invasion in 2003 and opposed President Bush&#x27;s 2006 request to send additional troops. He cited veterans&#x27; affairs as his top priority in 2010.

In 2017, Neal backed the Israeli Anti-Boycott Act, aimed to punish companies that boycott Israel.

===== Health care =====
A longtime advocate of health care reform, Neal was involved in the major health care reform efforts of 1993–94 and 2009–10. In working on the unsuccessful Clinton health care plan of 1993 he served the interests of the major health insurance and medical companies in his district, achieving a compromise allowing insurance companies to charge small businesses higher premiums. He was later involved writing the House&#x27;s 2009 health care reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures subcommittee, he had a hand in developing the bill&#x27;s financing plan. He explained that his priorities were to address &quot;pre-existing conditions, capping out-of-pocket expenses and making sure people don&#x27;t lose their health care if they lose their job&quot;. Despite his support for the act, he spoke about his preference for a &quot;piecemeal&quot; approach to health care reform, saying it would allow for a more reasonable debate.

As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, before a March 2019 hearing on Medicare for All, Neal told Democrats on the panel that he didn&#x27;t want the phrase &quot;Medicare for All&quot; to be used. He argued that Medicare for All was wrong on policy and a political loser. In December 2019, some blamed Neal for killing legislation that would have ended surprise medical bills, suspecting it may have been because of industry lobbyist donations to his reelection campaign. As of the 2019–20 election cycle, Neal is third-highest among House members in campaign contributions from the health services/HMO industry. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries are among the top contributors to his campaign committee.

===== Retirement planning =====

Neal introduced the bipartisan SECURE Act of 2019, which contained a number of provisions to expand access to retirement planning options and encourage employers to set up retirement plans for workers. The bill, originally introduced in late March 2019, became law in December 2019 as part of the fiscal year 2020 federal appropriations bill.

===== Ukraine =====
In 2023, Neal was among 49 Democrats to break with President Joe Biden, by voting for a ban on cluster munitions to Ukraine.

===== Abortion =====

Representing a relatively Catholic district, Neal has a more conservative record on abortion than other representatives from Massachusetts. He said in 2010, &quot;I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I&#x27;d keep &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and restrict it. I&#x27;ve always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [Given] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I&#x27;m mixed, and guess what? That&#x27;s where the American people are.&quot; He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment to restrict government funding of abortion. In 2021 Neal was listed as an original co-sponsor of the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act.

===== Other social issues =====
On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

<doc id="440802" wikidata="Q745385" url="?curid=440802" title="South Derbyshire">
<text>South Derbyshire is a local government district in Derbyshire, England. The district covers the towns of Melbourne and Swadlincote as well as numerous villages and hamlets such as Hilton, Hatton, Etwall, Aston-on-Trent, Repton, Weston-on-Trent and Willington. About a third of the National Forest lies within the district.

The neighbouring districts are Derbyshire Dales, Amber Valley, Derby, Erewash, North West Leicestershire, Lichfield and East Staffordshire.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Repton Rural District
*South East Derbyshire Rural District (part south of the River Derwent, rest went to Erewash)
*Swadlincote Urban District
The new district was named South Derbyshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==

South Derbyshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Derbyshire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent by-election in July 2024, the composition of the council was:

<doc id="440803" wikidata="Q1350065" url="?curid=440803" title="Borough of Erewash">
<text>Erewash () is a local government district with borough status in Derbyshire, England. The borough is named after the River Erewash. The council has offices in both the borough&#x27;s towns of Ilkeston and Long Eaton. The borough also includes several villages and surrounding rural areas. Some of the built-up areas in the east of the borough form part of the Nottingham Urban Area.

Erewash Borough has military affiliations with 814 Naval Air Squadron Fleet Air Arm based at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Culdrose and the Mercian Regiment of the British Army, as the successors to the local infantry regiment the Sherwood Foresters.

The neighbouring districts are South Derbyshire, Derby, Amber Valley, Broxtowe, Rushcliffe and North West Leicestershire.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of nine districts within Derbyshire. The new district covered the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ilkeston Municipal Borough
*Long Eaton Urban District
*South East Derbyshire Rural District (part north of the River Derwent, rest went to South Derbyshire)
The new district was named after the River Erewash, which forms the district&#x27;s eastern boundary. On 28 June 1974 the district was awarded borough status, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==

Erewash Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Derbyshire County Council. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Erewash. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council and executive. The leaders since 1974 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015, the council has comprised 47 councillors, elected from 19 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
When the council was created, it inherited three sets of offices from the predecessor district councils. The South East Derbyshire council offices on St Mary&#x27;s Gate in Derby were sold shortly after the new council&#x27;s creation. There was some discussion about building a central headquarters for the council, with possibilities examined at Ilkeston, Long Eaton and Sandiacre, but it was decided in 1976 that the cost of a single new building or a large enough extension to existing buildings was prohibitive. Instead the council built more modest extensions to the buildings it had inherited from the old Ilkeston and Long Eaton councils, notably in 1981 to Ilkeston Town Hall, and in 1991 to The Hall in Long Eaton, renaming the enlarged building Long Eaton Town Hall. The council continues to use both town halls for its offices and meetings.

==Parishes==
The towns of Ilkeston and Long Eaton are both unparished areas. The rest of the borough is divided into 13 civil parishes. None of the parish councils are styled as town councils.

*Breadsall
*Breaston
*Dale Abbey
*Draycott and Church Wilne
*Little Eaton
*Morley
*Ockbrook and Borrowash
*Risley
*Sandiacre
*Sawley
*Stanley and Stanley Common
*Stanton-by-Dale
*West Hallam
==Education==
The borough has fourteen state secondary schools and 41 primary schools. It is also home to the public (fee-paying) school of Trent College, with its junior/preparatory school, The Elms School.

Broomfield Hall of Derby College is located in Morley.

Derby Japanese School (ダービー日本人補習校 &quot;Dābī Nihonjin Hoshūkō&quot;), a Japanese weekend school, holds its classes in Broomfield Hall.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central broadcast from the Waltham TV transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Derby 
*BBC Radio Nottingham 
*Capital East Midlands 
*Smooth East Midlands 
*Greatest Hits Radio Midlands 
*Erewash Sound, the borough&#x27;s community based radio station which broadcast from its studios in Ilkeston.

<doc id="440807" wikidata="Q1337459" url="?curid=440807" title="Jim McGovern (American politician)">
<text>James Patrick McGovern (born November 20, 1959) is an American politician who has been a member of the United States House of Representatives since 1997, representing since 2013. A Democrat, he is the ranking member of the House Rules Committee, chaired the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and is the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. His district, numbered as the 3rd district from 1997 to 2013, stretches from Worcester to the Pioneer Valley.

Born and raised in Worcester, McGovern attended Worcester Academy. While in college he worked as a congressional intern and then aide to U.S. Senator George McGovern (no relation), a two-time presidential candidate for whom he campaigned. From 1981 to 1996 he was a senior staff member for U.S. Representative Joe Moakley. McGovern first ran for Congress in 1994, losing the Democratic primary. He ran again in 1996, defeating Republican incumbent Peter Blute.

As chairman of the board of the Congressional Hunger Center, McGovern is known as a leading voice on ending hunger and food insecurity both in the United States and globally. He was a key architect of the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. For his work he has earned a 2016 James Beard Leadership Award from the James Beard Foundation and a 2008 McGovern-Dole Leadership Award from the World Food Program USA.

Another focus of McGovern&#x27;s career has been international human rights, which he has advocated for in countries such as El Salvador, Sudan, Colombia, and the region of Tibet. He is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and has been ranked as one of Congress&#x27;s most liberal members.

==Early life, education, and career==
James Patrick McGovern was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 20, 1959. He grew up in Worcester, where his mother, Mindy, was a dance instructor and his father, Walter, owned a liquor store. In junior high school, he first became involved in politics by campaigning for Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern (to whom he is not related) in his unsuccessful 1972 presidential bid. After graduating from Worcester Academy, he moved to Washington, D.C., where from 1977 to 1980 he worked as an aide to George McGovern. 
Jim McGovern attended American University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1981 and a Master of Public Administration in 1984. He also served as director of the Kennedy Political Union, American University&#x27;s student-run speakers bureau. George McGovern ran for president again in 1984, and Jim McGovern was the state coordinator of his Massachusetts campaign branch, and made his nominating speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.

In 1981, Jim McGovern joined the Capitol Hill staff of U.S. Representative Joe Moakley. In 1990, Moakley appointed him to lead a House task force investigating the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador by the Atlácatl Battalion, working with Salvadoran activist Leonel Gómez Vides. He later advocated cutting off U.S. funding for the U.S. Army School of the Americas, where several of the military members had been trained.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Elections ===
McGovern first ran for Congress in 1994, entering a crowded Democratic primary to represent the area then defined as Massachusetts&#x27;s 3rd district. The district, in central and southeastern Massachusetts, included parts of Bristol, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Worcester counties–essentially, the heart of the MetroWest region. During the campaign, McGovern said his record as &quot;a Washington insider&quot; would make him a more effective representative. Despite endorsements from Moakley, George McGovern, and presidential aide George Stephanopoulos, McGovern lost the primary to Massachusetts State Representative Kevin O&#x27;Sullivan, who then lost to Republican incumbent Peter Blute.

McGovern left Moakley&#x27;s office in 1996 and moved back to Worcester, again running for Congress. This time, he won the nomination unopposed and faced Blute in the general election. His campaign slogan focused on unseating House Speaker Newt Gingrich: &quot;To dump Newt you have to dump Blute.&quot; Blute was endorsed by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and five other local papers, but McGovern won the election with 53% of the vote. He has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected 13 times. He ran unopposed in 2000 and 2002.

In 2004, he was opposed by Republican Ronald A. Crews, an evangelical pastor, former Georgia state legislator, and president of the Massachusetts Family Institute. A national conservative activist, Crews challenged McGovern&#x27;s positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. McGovern derided his opponent&#x27;s focus on social issues, saying, &quot;When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the first thing he thinks about is gay marriage. I don&#x27;t think that is the most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how to make the world a more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about.&quot; McGovern defeated Crews with 71% of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.

In the 2010 election, McGovern faced Republican Marty Lamb, a real estate lawyer, and independent Patrick J. Barron, a Department of Mental Health administrator. He was reelected with 57% of the vote.

When Massachusetts lost a district in the 2010 census, McGovern&#x27;s district was renumbered as the and pushed west to Amherst and the Pioneer Valley. He ran unopposed in 2012, 2014, and 2016.

=== Tenure ===
McGovern took over the top Democratic position on the House Rules Committee when Louise Slaughter died. After the 2018 midterm elections in which Democrats won the House majority, McGovern became chair.

Called the &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Committee&quot; because it is the mechanism that the Speaker of the House uses to maintain order and control of the House Floor, the Rules Committee is often considered the most powerful committee in Congress. As chair, McGovern can influence the introduction and consideration of almost every piece of legislation that comes to a vote.

One of McGovern&#x27;s first actions as chair was to pass a sweeping set of reforms to the House Rules. He wrote at the time that his changes were designed to &quot;usher in a new era of clean government&quot;. McGovern also said the rules changes were &quot;the result of unprecedented bipartisan outreach&quot; and that he had met with &quot;both Democrats and Republicans to seek their input on potential changes&quot;.

The &quot;National Journal&quot; reported that McGovern had used his Capitol Hill experience to help position himself as &quot;a power broker in the Democratic caucus&quot;. In 2001, McGovern&#x27;s mentor, Joe Moakley, at the time dying of cancer, asked Dick Gephardt to help McGovern attain a seat on the Rules Committee. He was given a commitment for the next available Democratic seat.

On the Rules Committee, McGovern has been able to use his experience with House procedures to his advantage. With Republicans comprising the majority of the panel, he &quot;showed a sharp partisan edge as he embraced parliamentary maneuvers that led to cries of outrage&quot; from Republican members.

==== Impeachments of Donald Trump ====
As chair, McGovern played a central role in devising procedures the House adopted for the first impeachment of Donald Trump. At the time, McGovern wrote in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that &quot;[t]he House will ensure the public-facing phase of this inquiry is transparent and will stand the test of time.&quot; He later explained his decision to vote for impeachment by saying, &quot;I often think about kids today getting involved in the political process just like I did back in 1972. What will they think if we say that the president’s actions don’t matter?&quot;

He supported impeaching Trump again for inciting the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack.

==== Visit to Ukraine ====
On April 30, 2022, McGovern accompanied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three other U.S. representatives on a secret trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The delegation pledged billions of dollars in military aid.

===Domestic policy===
====Transportation====
For his first three terms, McGovern served on the House Transportation Committee. He and Representative John Olver, who served on the House Appropriations Committee, coordinated to bring extensive transportation funding to their districts. When criticized for his heavy use of earmarks, McGovern responded, &quot;It&#x27;s not pork. It&#x27;s nourishment.&quot;

====Fiscal policy====
McGovern supported economic stimulus efforts during the late-2000s recession, including the Economic Stimulus Act in February 2008 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program) in October 2008. He supported the Obama administration&#x27;s 2009 stimulus package. Responding to Republican criticism of Democratic budgetary priorities, he chided the GOP for running up the national debt under George W. Bush, saying: &quot;It is somewhat ironic that the very people who drove this economy into a ditch are now complaining about the size of the tow truck.&quot; He voted to instate the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act in February 2010.

McGovern was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

====Education====
The Higher Education Act of 1998 included an amendment by McGovern that doubled Pell Grant funding for two years for students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their class.

====Nutrition====
As co-chair of the House Hunger Caucus, McGovern is an advocate for expanding child nutrition programs both domestically and internationally. In 2007, he obtained $840 million in required funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the House version of the farm bill. The House–Senate conference committee stripped most of the funding from the final bill.

As the co-chair of the Congressional Hunger Center, McGovern has pushed for changes to foreign aid and hunger relief programs. He proposed establishing a &quot;hunger czar position&quot; to take on food issues. McGovern also took part in the food stamp challenge, which entailed living on the average $21 in food stamps for a week.

====Immigration====
McGovern has voted against major efforts to restrict illegal immigration, including the REAL ID Act of 2005, the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005, and the Secure Fence Act of 2006.

====Health care====
McGovern believes health care is a human right. He voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, ultimately pushing for a robust public option that was not included in the final measure. He supports Medicare for All.

====Voting age====
In January 2023, McGovern was one of 13 cosponsors of an amendment to the Constitution of the United States extending the right to vote to citizens 16 years of age or older.

====Corporate personhood====
In 2010, McGovern said he thought the Supreme Court decision &quot;Citizens United&quot; was wrongly decided, and that the First Amendment does not protect unlimited political advertising by corporations. He elaborated, saying that corporations should not &quot;have the same equality as a regular voter&quot;. At first, he said that &quot;the Constitution was wrong&quot;, but later said he had misspoken. On November 15, 2011, McGovern introduced the People&#x27;s Rights Amendment, a proposal to limit the Constitution&#x27;s protections to only natural persons, not corporations. In January 2012, McGovern promoted his participation in a panel discussion titled &quot;Corporations are not people.&quot; On July 14, 2014, McGovern and Representative Ted Deutch introduced H.J. Res 119, which includes a section to address corporate personhood.

====Social issues====
McGovern has a pro-choice record on abortion. He voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in 2004. He supports stem cell research, voting for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act in 2005, 2007, and 2009. He voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, which would have prevented employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriage, in 2004 and 2006, and co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act of 2009, which would allow the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages.

====Objection to 2016 presidential election results====
On January 6, 2017, McGovern objected to Alabama&#x27;s electoral votes, which Donald Trump had won with 62.08% of the vote. Because no senator joined his objection, the objection was dismissed.

===Foreign policy and human rights===

==== China ====
On July 21, 2019, McGovern called attacks against Hong Kong&#x27;s anti-extradition bill protesters &quot;orchestrated violence against peaceful protesters&quot; and urged Hong Kong authorities to protect the freedom of demonstration.

On October 27, 2022, McGovern and Senator Jeff Merkley urged U.S. financial executives to cancel their attendance at the Global Financial Leaders&#x27; Investment Summit, saying, &quot;Their presence only serves to legitimize the swift dismantling of Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy, free press, and the rule of law by Hong Kong authorities acting along with the Chinese Communist Party.&quot;

On July 31, 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions over McGovern, alleging his frequent interference in China&#x27;s &quot;internal affairs.&quot;

==== Iraq ====
McGovern has vocally opposed the Iraq War since its inception. He voted against the initial authorization of military force against Iraq in October 2002. In May 2007, McGovern introduced , to &quot;provide for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq&quot;. The bill failed by a vote of 255 to 171.

==== Afghanistan ====
McGovern initially supported the War in Afghanistan, but became increasingly skeptical of it. In June 2010, he pushed a funding amendment to require President Barack Obama to make a draw-down plan before any further funding would be authorized. &quot;Let us not waste, you know, more resources, more lives, on a policy that quite frankly is going to lead us nowhere&quot;, McGovern said. &quot;We need to let Afghan President Hamid Karzai know that we&#x27;re not a cheap date. We expect him to clean up his government.&quot;

==== Sudan ====
McGovern has been a prominent voice against the Islamist governments of Sudan for its prosecution of the war in Darfur. He has been arrested three times, twice during protests outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington D.C. On April 28, 2006, he was one of five members of Congress arrested while protesting atrocities in Darfur, along with Sheila Jackson Lee, Jim Moran, John Olver, and Tom Lantos. McGovern was arrested again at the Sudanese embassy on April 27, 2009, this time accompanied by Representatives John Lewis, Donna Edwards, Lynn Woolsey, and Keith Ellison. He was arrested again on March 16, 2012, alongside George Clooney, during a protest outside the Sudanese embassy against the Bashir regime in Sudan.

In April 2007, he called for the U.S. and other countries to boycott the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing to protest the Chinese government&#x27;s support of the Sudanese government and, by extension, the genocide in Darfur.

==== Colombia ====
McGovern has traveled several times to Colombia to meet with human rights advocates, and has been very critical of Plan Colombia and US military aid to that country. On March 25, 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an unsigned editorial suggesting that McGovern supported the FARC rebels in Colombia. According to the &quot;Journal&quot;, an investigation of the computer hard drive of the recently killed Raúl Reyes, second-in-command of the FARC, had turned up material indicating &quot;an ardent effort&quot; by McGovern &quot;to do business directly with the FARC.&quot; The article said that McGovern had been &quot;working with an American go-between, who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia&#x27;s elected and popular government.&quot; In response, McGovern said that his concern was to help win the release of hostages held by the FARC, as requested by several of their families. He said he had no sympathy for the rebels.

On February 13, 2009, McGovern offered a resolution on the subject of the trial of the Iranian Baháʼí Faith leadership co-sponsored by seven others in . The situation has gathered international attention, including defense of Nobel Laureate attorney Shirin Ebadi after she received threats warning her against making speeches abroad, and defending Iran&#x27;s minority Baháʼí community.

==== Cuba ====
McGovern advocates normalizing diplomatic relations with Cuba. He accompanied President Barack Obama to Cuba in 2016. He said at the time that &quot;Americans have long been ready for a 21st-century approach to Cuba and with our two nations working together, we can create new opportunities for American businesses, increase travel and exchange, and support efforts in Cuba to advance democratic reforms and promote human rights.” He also joined Secretary of State John Kerry on a 2019 trip to reopen the U.S. embassy in Havana.

In 2000, McGovern met with the Cuban grandmothers of five-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Elian&#x27;s mother had drowned while trying to escape from Cuba with the boy. Although Elian reached Florida safely, McGovern advocated for his return to his father&#x27;s custody in Cuba.

In 2002 McGovern joined the Congressional Cuba Working Group, which advocated for lowering restrictions on travel and food shipment to Cuba. He is the current co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (formerly the &quot;Human Rights Caucus&quot;). His work on human rights issues earned him the Washington Office on Latin America&#x27;s &quot;Human Rights Award&quot; in 2007.

==== Myanmar ====
On November 18, 2013, McGovern introduced House Resolution 418. The resolution calls on the government of Myanmar to end the persecution and discrimination of the Rohingya people within its borders and calls on the U.S. government and the international community to pressure the Burmese to do so. The resolution was in response to allegations of Burmese Buddhist attacks on Rohingya Muslims earlier in 2014. McGovern argued that &quot;the Burmese government needs to recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic group. The situation is dire and rapidly deteriorating.&quot;

==== Syria ====
In 2023, McGovern was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

==== Ukraine ====
In 2023, McGovern was among 49 Democrats to break with President Joe Biden, by voting for a ban on cluster munitions to Ukraine.

==== Gaza ====
After the drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, Mark Pocan, Jim McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, Nancy Pelosi and 36 more members of Congress from the Democratic party urged U.S. President Joe Biden in an open letter to reconsider planned arms shipments to the Israeli military.

==== Other work ====
On April 25, 2018, 57 House members, including McGovern, released a condemnation of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine and Poland. They criticized Poland&#x27;s new Holocaust law and Ukraine&#x27;s 2015 memory laws glorifying Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and its leaders, such as Roman Shukhevych.

==Political positions==
McGovern has aligned himself with liberal and progressive causes. &quot;It&#x27;s no secret that I&#x27;m a liberal&quot;, he said in 2010. &quot;I didn&#x27;t poll any of this stuff, but I am who I am.&quot; Political interest groups generally rank McGovern as one of the most liberal members of Congress. The &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked him among the seven most liberal representatives in the 110th Congress and GovTrack ranked him as the 33rd most politically left in the 117th Congress. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted numerous similarities between McGovern and his mentor, 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern: &quot;Both are considered among the most liberal and anti-war lawmakers of their generation. The most prominent difference? They aren&#x27;t related.&quot;

From 1997 to 2007, the liberal advocacy group Americans for Democratic Action gave him an average vote rating of 98.5%, whereas its conservative counterpart, the American Conservative Union, gave him an average vote rating of 2.5%. The United States Chamber of Commerce, which advocates for business-oriented policies, gave McGovern a 33% lifetime rating as of 2011.

==Family and personal life==

McGovern lives in Worcester with his wife, Lisa Murray McGovern, a former aide to U.S. Representative Gerry Studds. They have two children. He has two sisters, who are teachers in the Worcester public school system.

In November 2010, McGovern underwent surgery to remove his thyroid gland after being diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, from which he has recovered.

McGovern is Roman Catholic and says that his legislative initiatives such as increased spending on global nutrition and raising taxes on higher income earners originate from the Catholic Church&#x27;s efforts to serve the poor. He has also said that he draws inspiration from Jesuit values, and in particular from his work as a congressional staffer to investigate the 1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador. McGovern told &quot;America&quot; magazine in 2019, &quot;I realized that if you commit yourself to a certain set of values, a life of service, if you are committed to lifting up the poor and standing with the poor, there&#x27;s something about that that can be very satisfying. It makes you feel like you&#x27;re living a life that&#x27;s worthwhile.&quot;

Meehan was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, one of seven children born to Martin T. Meehan (d. 2000), a compositor for &quot;The Lowell Sun&quot;, and Alice (Britton) Meehan (d. 2008). He graduated from Lowell High School in 1974.

Meehan attended the University of Massachusetts Lowell, graduating cum laude in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and Political Science. In 1981, Meehan graduated from Suffolk University with a Master of Public Administration degree, and a Juris Doctor from the Suffolk University Law School in 1986. He has received honorary degrees from the American College of Greece, Suffolk University, Green Mountain College in Vermont, and Shenkar College of Engineering &amp; Design in Israel.

== Early career ==
From 1978 to 1979, Meehan served on the staff to Lowell mayor Raymond F. Rourke. He was the press assistant to Representative James Michael Shannon from 1979 to 1981 and the head research analyst for the Massachusetts Senate&#x27;s joint committee on election laws from 1981 to 1984.

After completing law school, Meehan served as Director of Public Affairs to the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth and Deputy Secretary of State for Securities and Corporations from 1986 to 1990. From 1987 to 1988, Meehan was a member of the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Harvard Law School. From 1991 to 1992, Meehan was the First Assistant District Attorney for Middlesex County, where he established an innovative &quot;priority prosecution&quot; policy that targeted hardened criminals.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

Meehan ran for the U.S. House in the 1992 election, challenging another Democrat, the 4-term incumbent Chet Atkins. Atkins had a record of weak performances in Meehan&#x27;s hometown of Lowell, only winning the city by 2 votes in his close-run 1990 re-election campaign. Atkins also was caught up in the House Bank overdraft scandal, with 127 overdrafts, the second most in the Massachusetts delegation. The delegation leader in bank overdrafts, Joseph Early with 140, lost re-election in 1992 to Republican Peter Blute. Meehan beat Atkins, receiving 50,300 votes to Atkins&#x27; 26,855.

After winning the Democratic primary, Meehan was elected on November 3, 1992. He took office in January 1993.

=== Tenure ===
Meehan is generally considered to be a political liberal. Meehan is a prominent advocate for campaign finance reform and was one of the major sponsors of Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (called the &quot;Shays-Meehan Bill&quot; in the House and the &quot;McCain-Feingold Bill&quot; in the Senate). He has also been noted for his activism on gay rights issues, and was the chief sponsor of the measure repealing the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy.

Meehan successfully ran for the House in 1992 on a platform of reform, including a commitment to pushing through term limits for members of the House. As part of that platform, Meehan made a pledge not to serve more than four terms. On the House floor in 1995, he scolded members who might go back on their promise to limit their tenure in office. &quot;The best test of any politicians&#x27; credibility on term limits,&quot; he said, &quot;is whether they are willing to put their careers where their mouths are and limit their own service.&quot; Despite his pledge, Meehan again ran for Congress in the year 2000, exceeding four terms by two and a half times.

On October 10, 2002, Meehan was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. In January 2005, nearly three years after the fall of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime and as U.S. troops faced an &quot;increasingly sophisticated insurgency in Iraq,&quot; Meehan published a Congressional white paper advocating that Iraqi security responsibilities be transferred to a new democratically elected government and that the U.S. develop an exit strategy to remove troops within 12 months to 18 months. During a discussion panel at the Brookings Institution, Meehan expressed concerns about the Bush administration having &quot;no endgame in sight.&quot; He told the panel that &quot;it&#x27;s time for Congress to reassert its role in foreign policy and to take the lead in providing an exit strategy in Iraq.&quot;

Meehan&#x27;s campaign fund was among the largest campaign accounts of any House member, with $4,829,540 cash on hand reported on October 15, 2005. This is the result of raising more money than he spent in several campaigns since his first in 1992. In 2016, after his first year as president of UMass, Meehan closed his congressional campaign signaling an end to his political career so he could focus his energies on leading the UMass system.

In the 2004 Congressional race, Meehan raised $3,170,733 and spent $459,977 of that, thus adding $2,710,756 to his cash on hand. His opponent, Tom Tierney raised $30,943 and spent $30,406. Overall, in the 2004 race, incumbents in the House of Representatives on average raised $1,122,505 compared to $192,964 for their challengers.

Harold Brown Jr. interned with Meehan while studying at George Washington University. He went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and was killed in action at the Camp Chapman attack.

Meehan was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, if Massachusetts&#x27; junior senator, John Kerry, had been elected to the presidency.

Meehan worked with former Marine Staff Sgt. Eric Alva and a bipartisan group of representatives to Capitol Hill to reintroduce the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, legislation that would repeal the Pentagon&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy regarding gay service members.
==== Wikipedia editing ====
An unidentified individual operating through the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; internet connection made several favorable edits as well as removing statements declaring Meehan&#x27;s original campaign platform that included a promise not to run for more than four terms. Meehan&#x27;s chief of staff at the time, Matt Vogel, admitted to the press that he oversaw the edits and removal of the section that pointed out Meehan&#x27;s decision not to step down from office after four terms.

==== Retirement from Congress ====
On May 9, 2007, Meehan delivered an official resignation statement to the Speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), indicating that he would leave his post on 1 July 2007.

In response, Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA) announced a September 4 primary and an October 16 special election to determine Meehan&#x27;s successor. The winner was Niki Tsongas, the widow of Paul Tsongas, who held the seat from 1974 to 1979 before being elected to the Senate.

Meehan&#x27;s former chief of staff, Lori Trahan, won his former seat, now numbered as the 3rd District, in 2018.

== University of Massachusetts ==
Meehan became the President of the University of Massachusetts, a position he assumed in July 2015, after serving as Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Lowell since September 2007. On May 1, 2015, the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees unanimously elected Meehan, citing his record of achievement while serving as the Chancellor at UMass Lowell, his record of public service throughout his career, and his ability to communicate and to inspire, as being among the reasons for selecting him as the 27th President of the Massachusetts University System. Meehan is the first former graduate of a UMass school to serve as President of the UMass System.

Meehan was inaugurated at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate on November 12, 2015, where he vowed to fight for the University of Massachusetts, calling it &quot;the most important institution in Massachusetts in the critical areas of social mobility and economic growth.&quot;

Meehan made raising money for scholarship funds the centerpiece of his inauguration. With an initial fundraising target of $1 million, the privately funded inauguration far exceeded its goals and generated a record $1.7 million for student scholarships.

In his first year of presidency, the University&#x27;s enrollment reached a record 73,744 students, and research expenditures had risen to a high of $629 million. UMass increased its own funding of financial aid by nearly $20 million during Meehan&#x27;s first year, with spending rising from $236 million to a record $255 million, the highest ever. Additionally, the UMass Foundation, in part based on Meehan&#x27;s recommendation, voted to divest direct investments in fossil fuels from the university&#x27;s endowment, making it the first major public university in the nation to take such action.

As Meehan began his second year as President of the UMass System, he announced the closing of his congressional campaign, directed that funds be transferred to an education foundation, and stipulated that a $1 million scholarship donation be made to his alma mater, UMass Lowell.

During his years at UMass Lowell, the institution achieved record growth in enrollment, student retention and funding for research and scholarships.

During his tenure as chancellor, UMass Lowell for the first time was named a top-tier national university. It also was the top-ranked public research institution in New England for starting salary, mid-career salary and overall return on investment for graduates according to PayScale.com. Under Meehan&#x27;s leadership, UMass Lowell opened 10 new buildings over a five-year period, was named to the President&#x27;s Higher Education Honor Roll for community service and campus engagement for six years in a row and made a successful transition to NCAA Division I athletics.

Meehan was presented with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) 2014 President of the Year Award at the organization&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration and conference. He was honored by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) at the annual District I program in 2012 with the Chief Executive Leadership Award.

=== UMass Boston ===
On April 5, 2017, University of Massachusetts Boston officials announced that Chancellor J. Keith Motley would resign at the end of the academic calendar year on June 30, take a one-year sabbatical, and return as a tenured faculty member. Meehan stated that UMass Boston Deputy Chancellor Barry Mills, appointed the previous month, would serve as interim chancellor &quot;until [university] finances are stabilized and the university is positioned to attract a world-class chancellor through a global search&quot;, specifically to address the university&#x27;s 2017 operating budget deficit of $30 million. In response to the appointment of Mills and Motley&#x27;s resignation announcement, UMass Boston faculty publicly expressed concern that Motley was being scapegoated for the university&#x27;s budget deficit while Boston City Councilors Tito Jackson and Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts State Senator Linda Dorcena Forry, and Massachusetts State Representative Russell Holmes called upon Meehan to reject Motley&#x27;s resignation. On April 8, 2017, at a UMass System Board of Trustees meeting, UMass Boston faculty and students protested decisions by university administration to cut offerings of courses (many required for graduation) in the upcoming summer semester, as well as other programs and to make expense adjustments which reduced the deficit to approximately $6 million or $7 million.

On July 1, 2017, Barry Mills became interim chancellor. In November 2017, an audit Meehan commissioned from KPMG was presented to the System Board of Trustees that found that faulty record keeping, a lack of discipline in its budgeting process, and a failure on the part of UMass Boston administration to appreciate the cost of the campus renewal construction projects on the university&#x27;s operating budget led to the university&#x27;s $30 million budget deficit, and in the same month, the university laid-off 36 employees after laying off about 100 non-tenure track faculty earlier in the year. In April 2018, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Mount Ida College administrators announced that the former school would acquire the latter&#x27;s campus in Newton after the latter college&#x27;s closure. The acquisition was immediately opposed by UMass Boston faculty and students due to inadequate consultation with the Boston campus faculty, the Boston campus&#x27; budget deficit, and that because of the proximity of the Mount Ida campus to the Boston campus, the faculty contended that the new campus would compete with the Boston campus.

In April 2018, the UMass Boston campus was the sole majority-minority campus in the UMass System. In May 2018, following the approval of the sale by the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, the UMass Boston Faculty Council passed a motion of no confidence in Meehan and the System Board of Trustees. In the same month, 10 days after three finalists for the UMass Boston Chancellor position were named, on May 21, 2018, all three finalists withdrew from consideration after faculty members questioned the qualifications of the candidates. On June 20, 2018, UMass System Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Katherine Newman was appointed as the university&#x27;s interim Chancellor by the System Board of Trustees effective July 1, 2018.

In May 2019, the Pioneer Institute released a white paper co-authored by former Massachusetts State Representative Gregory W. Sullivan (who also served as the Massachusetts Inspector General) that reviewed records obtained from the UMass System Controller&#x27;s Office (as well as other publicly available documents) that concluded that Chancellor Keith Motley and other UMass Boston administrators were scapegoated for the 2017 fiscal year $30 million budget deficit and that instead the approval by the System Board of Trustees of an accelerated 5-year capital spending plan in December 2014 without assuring that capital reserves would be made available to pay for the plan, as well as an error to a 5-year campus reserve ratio estimate prepared by the UMass Central Budget Office and presented to the System Board of Trustees in April 2016, was the cause of the $26 million in budget reductions implemented by interim Chancellor Barry Mills and that the reductions made at the direction of the UMass Central Office.

Additionally, the white paper states that KPMG&#x27;s 2017 audit was not conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or reported in accordance with auditing standards prescribed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and that the purchase of Mount Ida College in April 2018 was conducted by a wire transfer from the UMass System for $75 million without being included on the previously approved university capital plan at the time the UMass Central Office ordered the budget reductions rather than UMass Amherst purchasing the Mount Ida campus with loanable funds to be repaid with interest (and in contrast to how the transaction was described in a press statement issued by Meehan&#x27;s office). The following month, interim Chancellor Katherine Newman issued a press statement disputing the findings of the white paper.

In September 2019, the UMass Boston Faculty Staff Union President addressed the System Board of Trustees to protest the potential offering of equivalent programs at the Mount Ida campus that are already offered at the Boston campus. The following December, the UMass Boston Faculty Staff Union President presented the board with a petition from the Boston campus faculty reiterating their concerns about the Mount Ida campus and requesting more input into its planning. On February 10, 2020, University of California, Los Angeles Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco was unanimously appointed as the new permanent chancellor of the university succeeding Katharine Newman, and Suárez-Orozco assumed the position on August 1, 2020.

<doc id="440815" wikidata="Q782783" url="?curid=440815" title="Australian War Memorial">
<text>The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is a national war memorial, museum and archive dedicated to all Australians who died as a result of war, including peacekeeping duties. The AWM is located in Campbell, a suburb of the Australian capital city of Canberra. The grounds include five buildings and a sculpture garden. Most of the museum galleries and commemorative areas are contained in the Memorial Building.

Plans to build a national war memorial and museum were initiated shortly after the First World War, with the AWM formally established through federal legislation in 1925. Designs for the AWM were created by Emil Sodersten and John Crust, although the onset of the Great Depression delayed its construction. Work on the Memorial Building progressed in the mid-1930s, and the AWM was officially opened to the public in 1941. Several structures designed by Denton Corker Marshall were built on the grounds from the 1980s to 2000s, to house additional museum exhibits and administrative offices. In 1993, the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier was installed inside the Memorial Building&#x27;s Hall of Memory.

Although the memorial was initially envisioned to only commemorate those who had died as the result of the First World War, the institution&#x27;s scope was changed to include service-members of the Second World War in 1939, service-members from all other wars in 1952, and all Australians who died in conflict in 1975.

The memorial and museum is open daily excluding Christmas Day. The AWM holds several commemorative services on its grounds, including a nightly Last Post service, and national services for Anzac Day and Remembrance Day.

==History==
The Australian War Records Section was formed in May 1917 to ensure the preservation of records relating to the First World War. Records and relics were exhibited first in Melbourne and later Canberra.

The idea for a national war memorial to commemorate veterans and to showcase war trophies in the Australian capital was also conceived by Charles Bean a year earlier in 1916. The Commonwealth Government was supportive of Bean&#x27;s efforts and established an Australian War Memorial committee in 1919. Bean, together with John Treloar, the officer-in-charge of the Australian War Records Section and later the AWM&#x27;s first director, guided the creation of AWM. A museum to display collected war relics was also incorporated into the institution, with Bean and Treloar believing that the museum was philosophically and operationally inseparable from the memorial.

In 1923, the Commonwealth Government officially announced its intentions to build a national war memorial, with the AWM being formally established through legislation in 1925. A design competition for a new memorial was held from 1925 to 1926, although no winner was selected as none were able to satisfy the competitions criteria, generally by being too expensive. Instead Emil Sodersten and John Crust were asked to collaborate and create a design that incorporates Sodersten&#x27;s Art Deco style with Crust&#x27;s cost-cutting approach. Construction was set to begin in 1929, although its start was delayed due to the onset of the Great Depression. The project&#x27;s scope was also reduced due to the Depression and a limited budget. 

By 1934, the &quot;Lone Pine&quot; pine, propagated from a seed brought back from Gallipoli, was planted on the property, and some construction work had started again. By 1935, parts of the Memorial Building were occupied by AWM staff, although the AWM was not officially opened to the public until Remembrance Day in 1941. 

While the Memorial was initially intended to commemorate only World War I, in 1939 the beginning of World War II led to this role being reviewed. In 1941 the board of the Memorial recommended the Second World War be included and in 1952 the &quot;Australian War Memorial Act&quot; was amended to extend the AWM&#x27;s scope of commemoration to include Australian involvement in all wars. Perhaps inadvertently this also narrowed the scope of the Memorial to cover only Australian service personnel, excluding Australians serving in other Commonwealth forces, Merchant Navy sailors and civilians such as members of the Red Cross and war correspondents that has previously been intended to be within the scope of the Memorial. In 1975, its scope was expanded again to allow for the commemoration of Australians who died as a result of war, even those who had not served with an armed forces from Australia.

In 1993, a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was installed at the AWM. From 1996 to 1999, the AWM expanded and upgraded its museum galleries and exhibitions, as well as create a space for temporary exhibitions.

Christopher Latham was appointed as the AWM&#x27;s first musical artist-in-residence in 2017. Latham began his &quot;Flowers of War&quot; series in 2015 to commemorate First World War musicians and artists. His &quot;Gallipoli Symphony&quot; premiered in 2015 and &quot;Diggers&#x27; Requiem&quot; in 2018. The memorial commissioned Latham&#x27;s &quot;Vietnam Requiem&quot;, which was first performed in June 2021, and works are planned to commemorate the Korean War (2023), the Holocaust (2024), and World War II (2025).

In 2021, the National Capital Authority (NCA) approved the AWM&#x27;s expansion plans for the site, which involves the demolition of the old Anzac Hall and the construction of a new building that will also incorporate the area previously between the main memorial and ANZAC Hall. These plans have been heavily criticised due to architectural awards ANZAC Hall has received, the buildings short life-span before demolition (as it was only opened in 2001) and significant cost. Also involved in the expansion is an extension to the CEW Bean Building, and the refurbishment of the museum&#x27;s southern entrance and Parade Ground.

==Grounds==

The Australian War Memorial is located in Campbell, a suburb of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. It is situated on the symbolic terminus of the land axis of Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s plan for Canberra, at the base of Mount Ainslie. The property is approximately and is bounded by Limestone Avenue to the southwest, Fairbairn Avenue to the southeast, and Treloar Crescent to the north. It is positioned at the northern terminus of Anzac Parade, which aligns with the land axis of central Canberra&#x27;s design. This axis runs from the peak of Mount Ainslie in the northeast to Capital Hill, in the southwest, a distance of . The AWM&#x27;s positioning along this axis was deliberate to reflect its national importance and provide it with a clear line of sight to Parliament House and vice versa.

The entire AWM is listed on Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Heritage List, while the AWM and the adjacent Anzac Parade are also listed on the National Heritage List. Monuments and memorials situated at Anzac Parade are maintained separately by the NCA and do not form part of the Australian War Memorial. To the north of the park is Remembrance Nature Park, the Canberra terminus of Remembrance Driveway, a system of arboreal parks, landmarks and road-side stops between Sydney and Canberra commemorating the 24 World War II and Vietnam War Victoria Cross recipients. 

The southern face of the AWM grounds, the Parade Ground, includes the Stone of Remembrance, a six-and-a-half tonnes remembrance stone that serves as a focal point for major and national ceremonies at the AWM. The stone was relocated to the Parade Ground in 1962. The Parade Ground was redeveloped in 2004 to improve access for ceremonial events, with sandstone terraces and a forecourt surrounding the Stone of Remembrance. In 2021, the Stone of Remembrance was temporarily relocated to the AWM&#x27;s western courtyard to accommodate construction for the museum&#x27;s expansion.

The property comprises the Memorial Building, ANZAC Hall, the CEW Bean Building, the Administration Building, and a cafe. The Memorial Building houses the AWM&#x27;s commemorative and exhibition spaces and was opened to the public in 1941. The Administration Building houses the AWM&#x27;s administrative offices and was completed in 1988. During the 2000s, the AWM opened two new buildings to expand its exhibition and museum operations. ANZAC Hall was opened in 2001 as an exhibition space for large objects, while the CEW Bean Building was opened in 2006 to house some administrative staff and items from the AWM&#x27;s collection. Poppy&#x27;s Café was built during the early 2010s, replacing an older café building built in 1960. An underground parking lot is also situated under the cafe.

The design for the grounds and the Memorial Building were finalised by Emil Sodersten and John Crust during the 1930s. Designs for the AWM&#x27;s newer buildings, like the Administration Building, ANZAC Hall, and the CEW Bean Building were created by Denton Corker Marshall. The latter two building was built in excavated areas or areas of lower elevation so that it sits below the bulk of the Memorial Building. ANZAC Hall is located north of Memorial Hall and was designed to resemble a battleship, with its battered walls clad with metal panels and curved turret roof design intended to appear like a battleship. However, this building is currently being demolished, to be replaced with new building with a larger exhibition space.

===Memorial Building===

The AWM&#x27;s Memorial Building contains the site&#x27;s main commemorative areas, as well as most of its museum galleries. In addition to these spaces, the Memorial Building also contains the AWM&#x27;s research centre and the museum shop. Although the Memorial Building was one of the earliest buildings designed for the AWM, its design was not finalised until 1936. The building was officially opened on 11 November 1941, it was not completed until several decades later. Two extension wings, which utilised the same building design and materials, were built into the Memorial Building from 1968 to 1971. 

The building was designed in an Art Deco style, with Byzantine and Egyptian motifs in its interpenetrating masses and pylons at its front. The design is reflective of architectural designs that were popular during the period, with the Art Deco style being a popular design in Canberra during the interwar period. Egyptian architectural motifs common in late-19th century monuments, memorials, and mausoleums, had also merged with the Art Deco style of the period, regarded as a Moderne style. Although the Art Deco styling of the Memorial Building can primarily be attributed to Sodersten, Crust also had a strong influence on the design of the property, such as the addition of the Hall of Memory.

In 1937, the AWM&#x27;s board commissioned Napier Waller to create large-scale murals and mosaics for the building, and Leslie Bowles to produce designs for a large-shaped sculpture. The AWM rejected several design proposals by Bowles&#x27; before his death, with Ray Ewers commissioned to continue working on Bowles&#x27; designs. Ewers&#x27;s final design, &quot;Australian Serviceman&quot; was accepted in 1955, the same year Waller&#x27;s mosaics were installed in the Memorial Building&#x27;s Hall of Memory. Waller&#x27;s murals are the largest installed in Australia.

====Commemorative areas====

The AWM&#x27;s commemorative area includes the courtyard and the Hall of Memory, located immediately after the Memorial Building&#x27;s entrance. The entrance to the courtyard is flanked by lion statues from the original Menin Gate, donated to the Australian War Memorial by the Mayor of Ypres in 1936. The courtyard contains a reflecting pool and steps up its northern end leading to the Hall of Memory. The courtyard is lined by arched cloisters, with the Roll of Honour positioned behind them. The Roll of Honour panels were installed in 1961 to commemorate the dead of World War I. Subsequent panels to commemorate the dead from other conflicts were installed after the 1960s. The Roll of Honour is situated on the east, west and southern walls of the courtyard and contains the names of over 102,000 Australians killed in war, from the Mahdist War and the War in Afghanistan. No rank or distinction is recorded with the names, on the basis that all died equally.

The courtyard has 26 carved stone figures, representing Australian fauna and Indigenous people. The original plaster models were designed by Bowles and sculpted by W. Swan in 1940. However, as the carvings were made of Wondabyne sandstone, they suffered extensive deterioration until they were replaced in the 2010s. Originally all were gargoyles, but the two figures depicting an Indigenous man and woman had their functionality as gargoyles removed following consultations with Indigenous elders in 2017.

Plants were introduced into the courtyard in 1977, to address a perceived need to soften the &quot;austere&quot; appearance of the area. A granite cascade by Robert Woodward was added to the northern end of the pool in 1980, which was later replaced by an eternal flame in 1988.
==== Hall of Memory ====
The Memorial Building&#x27;s Hall of Memory is located north of the courtyard, in the domed portion of the structure. The dome itself is representative of the ascent of the dead. The Hall of Memory contains the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. The Hall also contained Ewer&#x27;s completed statue until its relocation to the sculpture garden in the late 1990s. Four pillars designed by Janet Laurence are placed behind the Tomb in front of a stained glass window, where Ewer&#x27;s statue once stood. The pillars represent the elements of air, earth, fire, and water. The stained glass windows and mosaics were designed by Waller, representing Australia&#x27;s armed services. Over six million glass tiles were imported from Italy to complete the mosaic compositions of an airman, sailor, servicewoman, and soldier.

The function of the Hall of Memory has shifted significantly from the original conception of the building. Previously it was intended to contain the Roll of Honour, but for cost reasons this was located in the courtyard in the final design. This left the purpose of the Hall uncertain, with Commonwealth Director of Works JS Murdoch recommending in the late 1920s a statute &quot;symbolising the effect of war on civilisation&quot;. Treloar suggested a stone of remembrance and a cross of sacrifice similar to those of the Imperial War graves where visitors could lay wreaths. However, the Depression ended further expansion. While some members of the RSL recommended a local tomb of the unknown soldier following the internment of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey, this was rejected by those who considered the Unknown Warrior as representing all the war dead in the broader British Empire. One member of the RSL stated &quot;we claim kindred with his sacred clay. He is our hero as much as he is the hero of any other part of the empire. His tomb is a symbol of British unity.&quot; This position was formally taken by the RSL in 1922, stating &quot;the sentiment of the Empire was expressed in the burial in London.&quot;

On the opening of the Memorial in 1941, the Hall was planned to contain a &quot;female figure, raised beyond a sarcophagus, symbolising Australia proudly and courageously giving her all in the cause of freedom and honour&quot;. This did not eventuate, and instead a monumental column designed by Leslie Bowles, was mocked up in plaster. It depicted four figures representing the Four Freedoms invoked by Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, the relevant minister severely attacked the proposal as a &quot;monstrosity&quot; and the plans for the artwork were destroyed. Subsequently, a work of monumental realism &quot;Australian Serviceman&quot; was installed, no longer a monument to mourning, but instead symbolising &quot;&#x27;Young Australia&#x27; in an attitude of Remembrance, Hope for the Future, Achievement&quot;.

The end of the British Empire and the rise in Australian nationalism lessened the connections Australians had with the Unknown Warrior in London. The RSL reversed its position in 1970, but the board of the Memorial was opposed stating that a tomb &quot;too late, and verging on the macabre&quot;. As such, the RSL reversed its position in 1971. However, calls for an internment continued and in 1991 Ashley Ekins proposed a tomb be included. &quot;Australian Serviceman&quot; was moved to a new sculpture garden in 1993. On Remembrance Day that year, prime minister Paul Keating participated in the ceremony of the internment with a lauded speech in which he declared &quot;He is all of them. And he is one of us.&quot; Later similar tombs were created in the other former British dominions of Canada (2000) and New Zealand (2004). Historians James Curran and Stuart Ward suggests that part of the impetus for a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier after so many years was the incongruousness of &quot;Australian Serviceman&quot;, &quot;arguable the last monument to muscular imperial manhood ever erected in Australia&quot; to Australians who now longer identified with the imperial ideal and instead looked for symbols more in keeping with Australia&#x27;s new independent status.

In 1999 the head of the tomb was inscribed with the words &quot;Known unto God&quot;, similar to those on other Commonwealth graves. A controversy erupted in 2013 when it was stated that this inscription was to be replaced with another quote from the Keating speech: &quot;We do not know this Australian&#x27;s name, we never will&quot;. However, due to criticism this plan was dropped, with instead the previously mentioned Keating quote replaced a previous inscription that stated &quot;He symbolises all those Australians who&#x27;ve died in war&quot;.

====Museum areas====

The Memorial Building&#x27;s museum and exhibits are located on its lower levels and surround the building&#x27;s commemorative sections. Several galleries in the Memorial Building are organised by conflict, like the First World War gallery and the Second World War gallery. The AWM also operates galleries that are not specific to a single conflict, like the Colonial Conflict gallery, Conflicts 1945 to Today gallery, the Aircraft Hall, and the Hall of Valour. Although many of these galleries incorporate dioramas, most of them are located in the First and Second World War galleries. Most of these dioramas are made of hessian, plaster, timber, and lead, and were designed to be transportable.

The First and Second World War galleries are made up of four interconnected galleries and are located in the oldest portions of the building. These interconnected galleries formerly had a skylight running its full length, although this was later covered up to protect items on display from exposure. The Second World War gallery was redeveloped in the late 1990s, while the First World War gallery was redeveloped in 2014. The Sinai and Palestine area in the First World War gallery is the only exhibition in the AWM that retained many of its original architectural and exhibition features.

The Aircraft Hall, the Special Exhibition Gallery, the Orientation Gallery, and the Conflicts 1945 to Today Gallery are the newest galleries installed in the AWM. The former three galleries were installed in the late 1990s, and the latter gallery was installed in 2007–08.

The Hall of Valour is another gallery that is located below the Hall of Memory and honours Australia&#x27;s Victoria Cross and George Cross recipients. The AWM&#x27;s collection contains a display of 76 of the 101 Victoria Crosses awarded to Australian soldiers and is the largest publicly held collection of the medal in the world. This includes all nine Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians at Gallipoli: Alexander Burton, William Dunstan, John Hamilton, Albert Jacka, Leonard Keysor, Alfred Shout, William Symons, Hugo Throssell and Frederick Tubb. The medal issued to Shout was provided to the AWM by Kerry Stokes, who purchased the medal for a world-record price of A$1,000,000 and asked that it be displayed in the Hall of Valour. The remains of a mosaic from a Byzantine church uncovered by Australian soldiers during the Second Battle of Gaza are also installed in the Hall of Valour.

===Sculpture garden===

The western portion of the AWM grounds was remodelled in 1999 for use as a sculpture garden. The first sculpture placed in the garden was Ewers&#x27; &quot;Australian Serviceman&quot; statue, relocated from the Memorial Building&#x27;s Hall of Memory. As of 2022, a total of 25 memorials or sculptures have been installed within the grounds of the AWM, and over 150 plaques which commemorate individual unit associations can be found in the gardens.

In addition to the sculpture garden, several sculptures are also located on the eastern portion of the AWM grounds.

==Commemorative services==

The Australian War Memorial organises a nightly commemorative service known as the Last Post service, as well as two national services for Anzac Day and Remembrance Day each year.

===Last Post ceremony===
The Last Post ceremony was a tradition that began in 2013 and occurs each day 16:45 AEDT. The ceremony begins with the singing of the Australian National Anthem, followed by a piper descending from the Hall of Memory. Visitors are then invited to lay wreaths and floral tributes beside the reflecting pool. A story about an individual on the memorial&#x27;s Roll of Honour is then read aloud by a volunteer from the Australian Defence Force. The ceremony then concludes with the sounding of the Last Post. The ceremony typically lasts under 30 minutes.

==Off-site storage facility==

Only five percent of the AWM&#x27;s collection is displayed at any time, with the remainder being stored at the Treloar Resource Centre in the industrial suburb of Mitchell. The facility also includes workshops that are used for restoration tasks. The facility is occasionally opened to the public for &quot;Big Things in Store&quot; open days.

==Publications==
The memorial played a key role in sponsoring the official histories that were produced for World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam. In addition, the memorial currently produces a quarterly magazine called &quot;Wartime&quot;. Featuring images from the memorial&#x27;s collection and articles written by established historians, according to the AWM, the magazine is &quot;devoted to the Australian experience of war; military history; and the effects of war on society&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s first issue was published in November 1997.

The memorial also previously published a journal titled &quot;The Journal of the Australian War Memorial&quot; (). In October 2003, after publishing 39 issues, the journal went into hiatus, although a fortieth and final issue was published in January 2007.

<text>Pierre Maurice Gy (; 25 July 1924 – 5 November 2015) was a chemist and statistician. Born in Paris, France, to Felix and Clemence, Gy graduated in chemical engineering from ESPCI ParisTech in 1946.

On graduation, Gy worked as a chemical engineer for the Compagnie Minière du Congo Français, Congo, before returning to Paris in 1949 as a research engineer for the mining and processing trade organisation Minerais et Metaux. It was during this time that Gy started to address fundamental issues in sampling, especially those concerned with characterising industrial bulk chemicals, aggregates and chemical processes. Gy became head of the mineral processing laboratories and, by 1962, technical manager, during which time he continued to develop his sampling theory. Since 1963 he has worked as an industrial sampling consultant.

Gy received doctorates in physics (1960) and mathematics (1975) from the University of Nancy but has always worked outside the academic mainstream, publishing 9 books and over 175 papers, including:

* (1979) &quot;SAMPLING OF PARTICULATE MATERIALS; theory and practice&quot;
*(1992) &quot;Sampling of Heterogeneous and Dynamic Material Systems: Theories of Heterogeneity, Sampling and Homogenizing&quot;
*(1998) &quot;Sampling for Analytical Purposes&quot;

In August 2003, the First World Conference on Sampling and Blending (WCSB1) was held in honour of Dr Pierre Gy in Esbjerg. WCSB2 was held in Queensland, Australia (May 2005) and WCSB3 in Porto Alegre, Brazil (October 2007). WCSB4 took place in 2009, WCSB5 in Santiago, Chile and WCSB6 in Lima, Peru. Pierre Gy&#x27;s work was still the subject of debate and recognition at WCSB7 in Bordeaux, July 2015.
He will remain one of the founding fathers of sampling science.

<doc id="440818" wikidata="Q257182" url="?curid=440818" title="Yvonne Elliman">
<text>Yvonne Marianne Elliman (born December 29, 1951) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress who performed for four years in the first cast of the stage musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. She scored a number of hits in the 1970s and achieved a US No. 1 hit with &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;. The song also reached No. 9 on the Adult Contemporary chart and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. Her cover of Barbara Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Hello Stranger&quot; went to No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and &quot;Love Me&quot; was No. 5; at the time she had 3 top 10 singles. After a long hiatus in the 1980s and 1990s, during which time she left music to be with her family, she made a comeback album as a singer-songwriter in 2004.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Elliman was born and raised in the Manoa neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. Her mother was of Japanese and Chinese ancestries and her father, a salesman for Best Foods, was of Irish descent. Elliman showed interest in music from an early age, playing the ukulele by age four and taking piano lessons at age seven. While attending President Theodore Roosevelt High School, Elliman performed in the school band on standup bass and violin. However, she became most proficient on the guitar and performed as a singer and guitarist in a folk music band named We Folk, which she formed with schoolmates. The band fared well competing in local talent shows. 

According to Elliman, she was truant during her senior year at high school but graduated owing to the intervention of Peter Wilcox, the school&#x27;s British-born band teacher, who persuaded her teachers to allow her to pass. He encouraged 17-year-old Elliman to relocate to London and pursue a musical career, which she did shortly after graduating.

===London years, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;===
Elliman&#x27;s singing career began in 1969 in London, performing in bars and clubs. At the time she did not like what she was singing. &quot;I hated the music then&quot;, she recalled in a 1973 interview, adding, &quot;I did it for the bread. I was into drugs and all that, and thought Grace Slick and the Jefferson Airplane was it&quot;. While still an unknown, she was discovered by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who asked her to sing Mary Magdalene&#x27;s part for the original audio recording of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Ian Gillan was featured singing as Jesus. After its release as an album in 1970, they invited her to join the stage show&#x27;s traveling cast, which she did for four years.

She had her first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit single in 1971 with the ballad &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Her original version was not issued as a single until a cover version by Helen Reddy started moving up the U.S. charts; appearing concurrently on the charts (a rare event, not common since the 1950s, when different releases played in different parts of the United States), Elliman&#x27;s original peaked at #28, while Reddy&#x27;s cover peaked at #13. In the end Elliman performed on the 1970 concept album, in the original Broadway cast (1971), and in the 1973 film. She and Barry Dennen were the only cast members that performed on the original record, original Broadway production, and the film. Her performance in the film as Mary Magdalene led to her being nominated for a 1974 Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

===New York and disco===
In 1971, aged 19, Elliman moved to New York City for the Broadway production of &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;, where she met her first husband, Bill Oakes, who was president of Robert Stigwood&#x27;s RSO Records. Before moving she was signed to Purple Records, singing on Jon Lord&#x27;s album &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; in 1971 and releasing her second solo album &quot;Food of Love&quot; in 1973. She was asked to sing backing vocals on Eric Clapton&#x27;s version of the Bob Marley song &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; in 1974. She then went on tour as part of Clapton&#x27;s band, and soon afterwards got her own recording contract with RSO Records. She continued to work with Clapton, performing on his albums from 1974-77, including &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s One in Every Crowd&quot;, &quot;E. C. Was Here&quot;, &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot;, and &quot;Slowhand&quot;. A first album for the RSO label (her third in all), &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, produced by Steve Cropper, produced no hit singles, but her next album, &quot;Love Me&quot;, produced by Freddie Perren, gave her two top-20 hits, &quot;Love Me&quot; (written by Barry and Robin Gibb), and a Barbara Lewis cover song, &quot;Hello Stranger&quot;. &quot;Hello Stranger&quot; topped the U.S. Easy Listening chart for four weeks, and was also a No. 15 pop hit in 1977; &quot;Love Me&quot; was a No. 14 pop hit in late 1976/early 1977.

Also in 1977, the Bee Gees were working on &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and wrote &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; for her but Stigwood wanted the Bee Gees to perform it. Instead, she sang &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;. The song became a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it is generally considered the high point of her recording career.

A few minor top 40 hits followed in 1979, including the title theme song from the film &quot;Moment by Moment&quot; and another disco track, &quot;Love Pains&quot;, which was a major club success. She appeared in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in a two-part episode (&quot;Number One with a Bullet&quot;, 1978) as an aspiring singer, performing the song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get You Outa My Mind&quot; with fellow guest performer James Darren. The single &quot;Savannah&quot; was also a minor hit.

===Hiatus and return===
After spending a decade pursuing her career, Elliman went on hiatus as she had two children at home.

In 2004, Elliman released the album &quot;Simple Needs&quot;, for which she wrote all the songs.

Elliman has continued performing at music festivals, benefits, and concerts. She performed on a PBS special on 1970s soul music in 2004, singing &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You.&quot; In 2014 she reunited with Neeley and Dennen in Verona for a special &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; event. She is featured on the 2014 Neeley EP &quot;Rock Opera&quot; performing a duet with him on &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;. In summer 2018, she joined in 45th anniversary &quot;Superstar&quot; film screenings events in Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
Elliman was married to RSO Records executive Bill Oakes from 1972 to 1980. She married songwriter Wade Hyman in 1981 and they had two children, Sage (born in 1982) and Ben (born in 1986). They later separated and divorced. She married Allen Alexander in 2016.

On August 16, 2017, Elliman was slated to sing for a Catholic school charity in Guam when she was stopped by customs for possession of marijuana and methamphetamine. After spending a night in jail, she and her husband pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance, continued with the planned concert, and were allowed to return to Hawaii on probation until their March 2018 sentencing. They were ordered to perform community service and serve the remainder of a two-week sentence, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said, &quot;by observing courtroom proceedings of a drug offender probation program in Honolulu.&quot;

<doc id="440819" wikidata="Q1282411" url="?curid=440819" title="Ed Markey">
<text>Edward John Markey ( ; born July 11, 1946) is an American politician serving as the junior United States senator from Massachusetts since 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he served 20 terms (18 full, two partial) as the U.S. representative for from 1976 to 2013. Before his congressional career, he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1973 to 1976.

In 2013, after John Kerry was appointed United States Secretary of State, Markey was elected to serve out the remainder of Kerry&#x27;s Senate term in a 2013 special election. Markey defeated Stephen Lynch in the Democratic primary and Republican Gabriel E. Gomez in the general election. He was elected to a full term in the Senate in 2014. Markey fended off a primary challenge from Joseph Kennedy III and was reelected in 2020 by a wide margin.

Markey is a progressive who has focused on climate change and energy policy and was chair of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming from 2007 to 2011. He is the Senate author of the Green New Deal. He is now the longest-serving Democrat in Congress, having served since 1976. His progressive policies have led to widespread support among young voters. &quot;The Hill&quot; has called him &quot;an icon to Gen Z activists&quot;.
==Early life and education ==
Markey was born on July 11, 1946, in Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Christina M. (née Courtney) and John E. Markey, a milkman. Markey&#x27;s mother was the valedictorian of her high school class but was unable to attend college because her mother died and she was needed to care for the family. The family was Irish Catholic, and Markey was educated at Immaculate Conception School and Malden Catholic High School.

Starting in the summer of 1965, Markey was the driver and salesperson for an ice cream truck in Lexington, Massachusetts. He was known as &quot;Eddie the Ice Cream Man&quot; to neighborhood children and used the proceeds from the HP Hood route to pay tuition at Boston College. In the late 1960s Markey was cited by the Lexington Police for the ringing of his bell to announce the ice cream truck&#x27;s presence. Soon after the citation, the selectmen of Lexington changed the ordinance and he was allowed to ring his bell.

Markey graduated from Boston College in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts and from Boston College Law School in 1972 with a Juris Doctor.

==Career==

After graduating, Markey worked as a lawyer in private practice. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1968 to 1973, attaining the rank of Specialist 4. He joined while a junior in college, and has said that he enlisted before knowing whether he would receive a Vietnam War draft notice. Markey also said that even though he opposed the war, he would have answered the induction notice and gone to Vietnam if he had been drafted, despite having secured a position in the Reserve. His South Boston reserve unit included Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill III, Steve Grossman, and Markey&#x27;s brothers Richard and John.

Markey was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he represented the 16th Middlesex district (Malden and Melrose) and 26th Middlesex district from 1973 to 1976.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

On May 21, 1976, incumbent Congressman Torbert Macdonald died in office. Markey, who had just been elected to a third term in the state house, entered a twelve-candidate Democratic primary for what was then the 7th district. In the primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—Markey won the nomination with a plurality of 22% of the vote. In the November 1976 election he defeated Republican Richard Daly 77%–18%. That election doubled as both a special election for the balance of Macdonald&#x27;s 11th term and a regular election for a full two-year term, and so Markey took office later that night. This gave him greater seniority than other Representatives first elected in 1976.

Markey was challenged in a Democratic primary three times, first in 1980, when he won 85%; then in 1984, when he won 54%; and finally in 2002, when he won 85% of the vote.

Markey was reelected 19 more times from this district, which included most of the northern suburbs of Boston. His lowest vote total was 62% in 1992, in a three-way election. Markey faced no Republican opposition in eight of his bids for reelection, in 1978, 1980, 1986, 1988, 1990, 2000, 2002, and 2006. His district was renumbered the 5th after the 2010 census, in which Massachusetts lost a district.

===Tenure===

Markey was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave him a &quot;Composite Liberal&quot; score of 89.2.

====Environment and energy====
In December 2007, Markey became the first US politician to use Second Life, through which he addressed the delegates of the UNFCCC in Bali as part of OneClimate&#x27;s Virtual Bali event. It was estimated that the carbon dioxide he saved by not flying to Bali was around 5.5 tons. Pressure from Markey prompted BP to provide a live underwater video feed showing oil leaking out of a pipe in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Markey has been a longtime critic of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and has been critical of the NRC&#x27;s decision-making on the proposed Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design and the NRC response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

In reply to Alaska&#x27;s Governor Sarah Palin&#x27;s position on how the American Clean Energy and Security Act (also known as Waxman-Markey, named after Markey and Henry Waxman) could have a negative impact for Alaskans, Markey wrote an article criticizing Palin&#x27;s inaction on global warming and her environmental positions.

Markey sarcastically suggested in August 2010 that global warming deniers form their own country on an iceberg: &quot;An iceberg four times the size of Manhattan has broken off Greenland, creating plenty of room for global warming deniers to start their own country.&quot; Markey also said that, at the time, 2010 was the hottest recorded year and that &quot;scientists agree Arctic ice is a canary in a coal mine that provides clear warnings on climate&quot;. Markey has derided Republicans&#x27; stance on global warming, stating during a hearing: &quot;I won&#x27;t physically rise, because I&#x27;m worried that Republicans will overturn the law of gravity, sending us floating about the room.&quot;

In January 2011, House Republicans eliminated the Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming, which Nancy Pelosi created in 2006 and Markey chaired.

====Objection to the 2004 presidential election====
Markey was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted not to count Ohio&#x27;s 20 electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. George W. Bush had won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote, as dictated by the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

====Domestic initiatives====
Markey introduced legislation to change the duration of Daylight Saving Time and to increasing privacy controls over children online.

Markey drew some controversy through his proposal to introduce legislation that deals with amusement parks&#x27; roller coasters, believing that newer, faster rides that exert greater G-pressures on the human body are dangerous mentally and physically, despite a lack of concrete evidence to support these claims, and contrary to studies that affirmed the safety of roller coasters in general.

In 2009, Markey sponsored the Internet Freedom Preservation Act to enact principles of net neutrality. The proposed legislation received support from a few dozen co-sponsors and public interest organizations but ultimately died in committee before enactment.
====National defense====
In 2003, Markey called attention to the lack of security surrounding air cargo placed on commercial passenger planes, arguing that if passenger baggage is screened for explosive devices, cargo on the plane should be as well. In 2007, he succeeded in getting a 100% air cargo screening requirement signed into law. In the law codifying the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, Markey wrote the mandate requiring all cargo on passenger planes to be screened.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
** Subcommittee on Energy and Power
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
* Committee on Natural Resources (Ranking Member)
** As Ranking Member, Markey served as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member on all Subcommittees

==U.S. Senate==

In 2004, Markey was considered a contender for John Kerry&#x27;s seat in the United States Senate if Kerry were to be elected President of the United States. He was also considered a leading contender in the 2010 special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, but on September 12, 2009, he announced his decision not to run and endorsed fellow Congressman Michael Capuano, who went on to lose the Democratic primary to Martha Coakley.

===Elections===

==== 2013 special ====
On December 27, 2012, Markey was the first to announce his candidacy to run in a special election to fill Kerry&#x27;s seat after Barack Obama nominated him for United States Secretary of State. Several politicians, including Kerry, endorsed Markey even before the Senate confirmed Kerry. On April 30, 2013, Markey won the Democratic nomination by defeating fellow Congressman Stephen Lynch in the primary election. He defeated Republican challenger Gabriel E. Gomez in the general special election on June 25 and completed the remaining 17 months of Kerry&#x27;s term.

Markey is the longest-tenured House member ever elected to the Senate, with his 36-plus years of service exceeding that of Frederick H. Gillett, who served in the House for 32 years before moving to the upper chamber in 1925. He is the 11th oldest candidate to win a U.S. Senate special election out of more than 170 people since the passage of the 17th Amendment.

==== 2014 ====

Markey sought a full six-year term in 2014. He defeated Republican Hopkinton selectman Brian Herr with 62 percent of the vote.

==== 2020 ====

In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Markey endorsed fellow Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. After Warren withdrew in early 2020, he endorsed Joe Biden.

Several Massachusetts Democrats announced primary challenges to Markey in the September 1, 2020 election, but all but 4th district Representative Joe Kennedy III dropped out, leaving Kennedy as the sole challenger. On September 13, 2019, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom Markey has collaborated on the proposed Green New Deal, endorsed Markey.

Markey defeated Kennedy with 55.6% of the vote, with overwhelming margins in Boston and the surrounding suburbs, including Kennedy&#x27;s Newton, and in the college towns of Western Massachusetts. The primary race was seen by many as a showdown between the Democratic establishment, represented by Kennedy, and its new and growing progressive wing, embodied by Markey. Despite the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#x27;s longstanding opposition to Democratic primary challengers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed Kennedy, whose fundraising and campaigning efforts she credited for returning the House to Democratic control in the 2018 midterm elections. Meanwhile, Markey had the support of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ocasio-Cortez, and the youth-led Sunrise Movement founded in 2017 to promote the Green New Deal as a solution to the climate crisis.

Markey defeated Republican Kevin O&#x27;Connor in the general election.

===Tenure===

Markey resigned his House seat on July 15, 2013, and was sworn into the Senate on July 16. Although he is the dean of the Massachusetts delegation, he is the state&#x27;s junior Senator, since Elizabeth Warren took office six months before he did.

Markey is known for the &quot;blizzard&quot; of public letters he posts on his website and sends to the press to draw attention to his favored issues.

Markey was on Capitol Hill to participate in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. During the attack, he and his staff sheltered in place in an undisclosed location. During the siege, he tweeted, &quot;Donald Trump is responsible for the coup that is unfolding at the Capitol. He is a fascist and a direct threat to our country.&quot; After the Capitol was secure, Markey tweeted that Trump should be impeached. When Congress returned to count the electoral votes, Markey gave his remarks, calling Republicans who objected to the count seditious. The next day, he called for the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be invoked.

Markey was rated among the top ten most popular senators in a Morning Consult poll from April 2024.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
** Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband
** Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security
** Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard
** Subcommittee on Science and Space 
** Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security
* Committee on Environment and Public Works

** Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety
* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship (Ranking Member)

==Political positions==

=== Abortion ===

When he was first elected to Congress, Markey opposed abortion and supported a constitutional amendment to ban it. He described his opposition as a matter of conscience. Starting in 1983, he began moving away from his opposition, voting against measures that blocked funding for abortion for federal employees unless their life was at risk. During his 1984 Senate campaign, Markey said that while he still personally opposed abortion, he believed that it should remain legal. Since then, he has opposed restrictions on abortion. Markey wore a pin to the 2023 State of the Union Address with the word ABORTION with a heart in place of the central portion of the letter O. He attended the event with Kate Dineen, an abortion rights advocate.

=== Antitrust, competition and corporate regulation ===
In June 2019, Markey was one of six Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar who signed letters to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice recounting that many of them had &quot;called on both the FTC and the Justice Department to investigate potential anticompetitive activity in these markets, particularly following the significant enforcement actions taken by foreign competition enforcers against these same companies&quot; and requesting that each agency confirm whether it had opened antitrust investigations into each of the companies and pledge that it would publicly release any such investigation&#x27;s findings.

=== Child care ===
In 2019, Markey and 34 other senators introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, a bill that they claim would create 770,000 new childcare jobs and ensure that families making less than 75% of the state median income would not pay for child care, with higher-earning families having to pay &quot;their fair share for care on a sliding scale, regardless of the number of children they have.&quot; The legislation also supports universal access to high-quality preschool programs for all 3- and 4-year-olds and changes child care compensation and training.

=== Children&#x27;s programming ===
In 2019, after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced changes to the Children&#x27;s Television Act of 1990, Markey and eight other Democratic senators signed a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that expressed concern that the proposed changes &quot;would limit the reach of educational content available to children and have a particular damaging effect on youth in low-income and minority communities&quot; and asserted that the new rules would decrease access to valuable educational content through over-the-air services.

=== Climate change ===
In November 2018, Markey was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution in response to the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment findings. The resolution affirmed the senators&#x27; acceptance of the findings and support for bold action to address climate change. In 2019, the League of Conservation Voters, which works to elect pro-environment candidates, endorsed Markey.

Markey is the Senate author of the Green New Deal. In February 2019, Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released a 14-page summary of their Green New Deal plan to address climate change. It calls for implementing the &quot;social cost of carbon&quot; that was part of the Obama administration&#x27;s plans to address climate change and transitioning the United States to 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources, zero-emission vehicles, and high-speed rail systems. It also aims to provide new jobs and alleviate poverty. On March 26, in what Democrats called a &quot;stunt&quot;, Republicans called for an early vote without allowing discussion or expert testimony. Markey said Republicans were trying to &quot;make a mockery&quot; of the Green New Deal debate and called the vote a &quot;sham&quot;. In protest, Democrats, including Markey, voted &quot;present&quot; or against the bill, resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor.

In March 2019, Markey was one of 11 senators to sponsor the Climate Security Act of 2019, legislation to form a new group within the State Department to develop strategies to integrate climate science and data into national security operations as well as to restore the post of special envoy for the Arctic, a group that President Trump dismantled in 2017. The envoy would advise the President and the administration on the potential effects of climate on national security and be responsible for facilitating all interagency communication between federal science and security agencies.

Markey was a member of the Senate Democrats&#x27; Special Committee on the Climate Crisis, which published a report of its findings in August 2020.

===COVID-19 vaccine equity===
Markey proposed that the COVID-19 vaccine be distributed to underserved areas and communities of color as a priority for racial justice. On February 20, 2021, he said, &quot;Even though Black and Hispanic residents have borne the brunt of this pandemic here in Massachusetts and all across the country, these communities are not receiving the vaccine in proportion to their share of their population.&quot;

=== Disaster relief ===
In April 2018, Markey was one of five Democratic senators to sign a letter to FEMA administrator Brock Long calling on FEMA to enter an agreement with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that would &quot;stand up the Disaster Housing Assistance Program and address the medium- and longer-term housing needs&quot; of evacuees of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The senators asserted that &quot;FEMA&#x27;s refusal to use the tools at its disposal, including DHAP, to help these survivors is puzzling—and profoundly troubling&quot; and that hundreds of hurricane survivors were susceptible to being left homeless if FEMA and HUD continued not to work together.

=== Drug policy ===
In December 2016, Markey was one of 17 senators to sign a letter to President-elect Trump asking him to fulfill a campaign pledge to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, stating their willingness &quot;to advance measures to achieve this goal&quot;, and calling on Trump &quot;to partner with Republicans and Democrats alike to take meaningful steps to address the high cost of prescription drugs through bold administrative and legislative actions.&quot;

In December 2018, Markey was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the actions of the Food and Drugs Administration to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA &quot;to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth.&quot; In 2023, Markey introduced legislation to expand access to methadone for patients with opioid use disorder.

=== Economy ===
In February 2019, Markey was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice asking that regulators prohibit a proposed $26-billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint because American enforcers have understood for the last 30 years &quot;that fostering robust competition in telecommunications markets is the best way to provide every American with access to high-quality, cutting-edge communications at a reasonable price&quot; and the merger would result in a return &quot;to the dark days of heavily consolidated markets and less competition, with all of the resulting harms.&quot;

In March 2019, Markey was one of six senators to sign a letter to the Federal Trade Commission requesting that it &quot;use its rulemaking authority, along with other tools, in order to combat the scourge of non-compete clauses rigging our economy against workers&quot; and saying that non-compete clauses &quot;harm employees by limiting their ability to find alternate work, which leaves them with little leverage to bargain for better wages or working conditions with their immediate employer.&quot; The letter added that the FTC was responsible for protecting consumers and workers and needed to &quot;act decisively&quot; to address their concerns over &quot;serious anti-competitive harms from the proliferation of non-competes in the economy.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===

In December 2016, Markey and Senators Chris Coons and Marco Rubio suggested to the Department of State that the U.S. curtail assistance to the Philippines&#x27; law enforcement units due to alleged extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations in Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s drug war, in adherence to the Leahy Law. In April 2019, Markey and four other Democratic and Republican senators introduced a resolution urging the release of Philippine senator Leila de Lima, a key proponent of the inquiry on the Duterte administration&#x27;s reported human rights violations who has been detained since 2017 for suspected drug trafficking; the senators believed that De Lima&#x27;s detention was politically motivated. In January 2020, Markey revealed that the Philippine government had declared him and Senators Dick Durbin and Patrick Leahy (principal sponsor of the Leahy Law) &quot;persona non grata&quot; to the country. After Duterte stepped down from office in 2022, Markey visited the Philippines and met with De Lima privately.

In October 2017, Markey condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar.

In 2018, Markey cosponsored the Countering the Chinese Government and Communist Party&#x27;s Political Influence Operations Act, a bill introduced by Rubio and Catherine Cortez Masto that would give the U.S. Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) the authority to create an interagency task force to examine Chinese attempts to influence the U.S. and key allies.

In October 2018, Markey was one of eight senators to sign a letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats requesting a classified briefing on what the American intelligence community knew about threats to U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi so that the senators could fulfill their &quot;oversight obligation&quot; as members of Congress. In March 2019, Markey was one of nine Democratic senators to sign a letter to Salman of Saudi Arabia requesting the release of human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair and writer Raif Badawi, women&#x27;s rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi, and Dr. Walid Fitaih. The senators wrote, &quot;Not only have reputable international organizations detailed the arbitrary detention of peaceful activists and dissidents without trial for long periods, but the systematic discrimination against women, religious minorities and mistreatment of migrant workers and others has also been well-documented.&quot;

In November 2018, Markey, Senators Chris Coons and Elizabeth Warren, and a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent the Trump administration a letter raising concerns about the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s undue influence on media outlets and academic institutions in the United States. They wrote: &quot;In American news outlets, Beijing has used financial ties to suppress negative information about the CCP... Beijing has also sought to use relationships with American academic institutions and student groups to shape public discourse.&quot;

In February 2019, ahead of the 2019 North Korea–United States Hanoi Summit, Markey said that it was &quot;pretty clear that Kim wants to have a personal meeting with Trump with hopes that he can, in fact, elicit concessions from President Trump that might not otherwise be possible if it was just our diplomats talking one-on-one&quot; and that the US &quot;could run the risk that Kim is given concessions which are not accompanied by real concessions that the United States is receiving in return from Kim and his regime.&quot; Markey called for Trump to receive commitments on denuclearization from Kim Jong-un before making commitments in return.

In April 2019, Markey was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.

In October 2020, Markey accused Turkey, a NATO ally, of inciting war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and called on the Trump administration to immediately suspend U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan sent through the Pentagon&#x27;s &quot;building partner assistance program&quot;. According to critics, the aid could be used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. He co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that read: &quot;If Turkey is unwilling to step back from active engagement in the conflict, then the State Department should immediately suspend all sales and transfers of military equipment to Ankara.&quot;

In January 2024, Markey voted for a resolution, proposed by Bernie Sanders, to apply the human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act to U.S. aid to Israel&#x27;s military. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11.

==== Iraq War ====
On October 10, 2002, Markey voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, authorizing the use of the United States Armed Forces against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government in what became Operation Iraqi Freedom. As of March 2020, Markey has said that voting for the authorization was a &quot;mistake&quot;, and that he did so because &quot;George Bush lied, Donald Rumsfeld lied, Dick Cheney lied to the American people about the presence of nuclear weapons in Iraq. I&#x27;m still angry about that lie to the American people.&quot;

===Government shutdown ===
In March 2019, Markey and 38 other senators signed a letter to the Appropriations Committee opining that contractor workers and, by extension, their families &quot;should not be penalized for a government shutdown that they did nothing to cause&quot; while noting that there were bills in both chambers of Congress that if enacted would provide back pay to compensate contractor employees for lost wages. The letter urged the Appropriations Committee &quot;to include back pay for contractor employees in a supplemental appropriations bill for FY2019 or as part of the regular appropriations process for FY2020.&quot;

===Gun law===
Markey supports gun control, including improved background checks, ending illegal gun trafficking, and closing loopholes on gun purchases.
In 2015, he proposed a &quot;smart gun&quot; bill that aimed to equip handguns with technology, making them usable by only the purchaser.

In January 2016, Markey led 18 senators in signing a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and &quot;the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it&quot; with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps &quot;to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public-health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.&quot;

After the Orlando nightclub shooting, Markey called for more gun regulations and supported the Feinstein Amendment, which would have made it illegal for suspected terrorists to buy guns. He also supports universal background checks.

In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Markey said, &quot;This Congress has the responsibility to make sure the NRA stands for &#x27;not relevant anymore&#x27; in American politics, and we have to begin this debate now.&quot; He co-sponsored a proposal to ban bump stocks, which make semi-automatic weapons act like automatic weapons.

In November 2017, Markey was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, a bill to create a charge of domestic violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions must be reported to federal databases to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the UCMJ whereby convicted abusers retain the ability to purchase firearms.

In January 2019, Markey was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill requiring background checks to sell or transfer all firearms, including unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events temporarily, giving firearms to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

=== Health care ===
Markey supports the creation of a single-payer federal healthcare program. In September 2017, he was one of 16 senators to cosponsor the 2017 Medicare for All Act introduced by Bernie Sanders, which proposes establishing a federal health insurance program by expanding Medicare coverage to all United States residents.

In June 2019, Markey was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Territories Health Equity Act of 2019, legislation that would remove the cap on annual federal Medicaid funding and increase the federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures of territories along with providing more funds for prescription drug coverage to low-income seniors in an attempt to equalize funding for American territories Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands with that of U.S. states.

=== Housing ===
In April 2019, Markey was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that President Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators hoped the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

=== Immigration ===
In July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to cease protecting spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Markey was one of 22 senators led by Tammy Duckworth to sign a letter arguing that the protection gave service members the ability &quot;to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away&quot; and that its termination would both cause service members personal hardship and negatively affect their combat performance.

Also in July 2019, Markey and 15 other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which would require, except in special circumstances, that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor before engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations and that agents receive annual training in addition to reporting annually on enforcement actions in those locations.

=== Internet ===

==== Internet security ====
On October 27, 2006, Markey called for the arrest of security researcher Christopher Soghoian for creating a website to generate fake boarding passes. At 2 AM on October 28, 2006, FBI agents seized computers and other materials from Soghoian&#x27;s house.

On October 29, 2006, Markey issued a statement revising his previous comments, stating that the Department of Homeland Security should instead &quot;put him to work showing public officials how easily our security can be compromised&quot;. The statement was critical of Soghoian&#x27;s disclosure method—deeming it &quot;ill-considered&quot;—but also said that &quot;he should not go to jail for his bad judgment&quot;.

==== Net neutrality ====

In May 2014, days before the FCC was scheduled to rewrite its net neutrality rules, Markey was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler arguing that Wheeler&#x27;s proposal would destroy net neutrality and urging the FCC to &quot;consider reclassifying Internet providers to make them more like traditional phone companies, over which the agency has clear authority to regulate more broadly.&quot;

In September 2017, Markey was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai accusing the FCC of failing &quot;to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on the tens of thousands of filed complaints that directly shed light on proposed changes to existing net neutrality protections.&quot;

In March 2018, Markey was one of ten senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley lambasting Pai&#x27;s proposal to cut the Lifeline program during a period when roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on it for access to high-speed internet, writing that it was Pai&#x27;s &quot;obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service.&quot; The senators also wrote, &quot;Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services.&quot;

==== Internet privacy ====
In February 2019, Markey, Richard Blumenthal, and Josh Hawley sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter about Project Atlas and its relevance to &quot;longstanding concerns that Facebook has used its products to deeply intrude into personal privacy.&quot;

=== Labor ===
In May 2018, Markey led 11 senators in signing a letter to the Chairman of the Federal Labor Relations Authority Colleen Kiko urging the FLRA to end efforts to close its Boston regional office until Congress debated the matter because the closure would place staff farther away from the federal employees whose rights they protect.

=== LGBT rights ===
In 1996, Markey voted against the Defense of Marriage Act.

In September 2014, Markey was one of 69 members of the US House and Senate to sign a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.

In May 2017, Markey was one of 46 senators to introduce the Equality Act of 2017, described by Representative David Cicilline as ensuring &quot;that every LGBT person can live their lives free from the fear of discrimination. Above all, it&#x27;s about honoring the values that have guided our nation since its founding. It&#x27;s critical that Congress pass the Equality Act into law.&quot;

In October 2018, Markey was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBT diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBT individuals &quot;subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities&quot; and that refusing to let LGBT diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding &quot;the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.&quot;

In June 2019, Markey was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Pompeo requesting an explanation of a State Department decision not to issue an official statement that year commemorating Pride Month nor to issue the annual cable outlining activities for embassies commemorating Pride Month. They also asked why the LGBT special envoy position remained vacant and asserted that &quot;preventing the official flying of rainbow flags and limiting public messages celebrating Pride Month signals to the international community that the United States is abandoning the advancement of LGBTI rights as a foreign policy priority.&quot;

In March 2023, Markey and Representative Pramila Jayapal introduced the Transgender Bill of Rights, a resolution that recognizes the federal government&#x27;s duty to protect the rights of transgender and nonbinary people. The bill strives to codify under law protections to ensure trans and nonbinary Americans are not discriminated against for their gender identity or gender expression.

=== Military ===
In August 2013, Markey was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department warning that some payday lenders were &quot;offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law&quot; and asserting that service members and their families &quot;deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound.&quot;

=== Nuclear waste ===
In July 2019, Markey was an original cosponsor of the Sensible, Timely Relief for America&#x27;s Nuclear Districts&#x27; Economic Development (STRANDED) Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Susan Collins and Tammy Duckworth that would give local government entities economic impact grants to offset the economic impact of stranded nuclear waste, form a task force to identify existing funding that could be used to benefit communities, and form a competitive innovative solutions prize competition to aid those communities in their search for alternatives to &quot;nuclear facilities, generating sites, and waste sites.&quot;

=== Opioids ===
In February 2017, Markey and 30 other senators signed a letter to Kaléo Pharmaceuticals in response to an increase of the opioid-overdose-reversing device Evzio&#x27;s price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500. They requested the detailed price structure for Evzio, the number of devices Kaléo Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the total federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year.

In March 2017, Markey led 21 senators who signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that said that 12% of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form or a substance abuse disorder, that one-third of treatment for opioid and other substance use disorders in the United States is financed by Medicaid, and that the American Health Care Act could &quot;very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders&quot; due to inadequate funding, often resulting in individuals abandoning substance use disorder treatment.

=== Pipelines ===
In October 2016, Markey was one of five senators to sign a letter to President Obama requesting the administration halt work on the Dakota Access Pipeline until the permitting process of the Army Corps was transparent and would &quot;include public notice and participation, formal and meaningful tribal consultation, and adequate environmental review&quot;, and stating their support for the &quot;tribes along the pipeline route in their fight against the Dakota Access pipeline project.&quot;

===Public transportation===
Markey advocates making public transit fare-free. In June 2020, he and Representative Ayanna Pressley co-authored the Freedom to Move Act, which would offer $5 billion in annual competitive grants to transit agencies that offer fare-free transit access. Markey argues that fare-free public transportation would help &quot;provide low-income workers, families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities with improved access to jobs, education, medical care, and other critical services.&quot; Markey and Pressley reintroduced the bill in April 2023.

=== Railroad safety ===
In June 2019, Markey was one of ten senators to cosponsor the Safe Freight Act, a bill requiring freight trains to have one or more certified conductors and a certified engineer on board who can collaborate on how to protect the train and people living near the tracks. The legislation was meant to correct a Federal Railroad Administration rollback of a proposed rule to establish safety standards.

=== State Department ===
In September 2018, Markey was one of five senators who signed a letter to then-United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to employ more multifactor authentication measures to secure the State Department&#x27;s information systems and seeking answers on how the department would boost its security following the Office of Management and Budget&#x27;s designation of the department&#x27;s cyber readiness as &quot;high risk&quot;, what the department would do to address the lack of multifactor authentication required by law and statistics on the department&#x27;s cyber incidents over the last three years.

=== Supreme Court ===

In April 2021, Markey sponsored a bill in the Senate to expand the Supreme Court of the United States from nine to 13 justices.

=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Markey was among the five Senate Democrats who voted against the final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.

<doc id="440825" wikidata="Q810508" url="?curid=440825" title="Bassetlaw District">
<text>Bassetlaw is a local government district in north Nottinghamshire, England. Its council is based in the town of Worksop; the other towns in the district are Retford, Tuxford and Harworth Bircotes. The district also contains numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

Bassetlaw is bounded to the south by the Newark and Sherwood and Mansfield districts, to the south-west by the Bolsover district of Derbyshire, to the north-west by the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham and the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, to the north by North Lincolnshire, and to the east by West Lindsey.

The district council is a non-constituent member of the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority.

== History ==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole of two former districts and most of another two, which were all abolished at the same time:
*East Retford Municipal Borough
*East Retford Rural District (except parish of Finningley, which went to Doncaster)
*Worksop Municipal Borough
*Worksop Rural District (except part of parish of Harworth, which went to Doncaster and was added to the parish of Bawtry)

The new district was named Bassetlaw after the medieval Bassetlaw Wapentake, which had covered a similar area. The council&#x27;s logo now says &quot;Bassetlaw District Council – North Nottinghamshire&quot;.

==Governance==
Bassetlaw District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Nottinghamshire County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2011.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1991 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and changes of allegiance in May 2024, the composition of the council was:

Three independent councillors sit together as a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2002 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 25 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

Most of the district is within the Bassetlaw constituency. The south-east of the district, including Tuxford, is in the Newark constituency.

=== Premises ===
Council meetings are held at both Worksop Town Hall, built in 1851, and Retford Town Hall, built in 1868, both of which the council inherited from its predecessor authorities. The council&#x27;s main offices are at Queen&#x27;s Buildings, completed in 1981 on Potter Street in Worksop, adjoining the Town Hall. The council also maintains an area office in Harworth.

== Settlements ==


Bassetlaw is divided into 64 parishes, each governed by an elected parish council or parish meeting. The two main settlements of Retford and Worksop are the only areas of the district that are unparished, however, both towns are entitled to elect a town mayor via their respective charter trustees.

== Wards ==
Bassetlaw is divided into 25 wards for electoral purposes. Each ward returns either one, two or three councillors at each election depending upon the number of electors within each ward.


== Demography ==

=== Population ===
=== Religion ===
==Media==
Bassetlaw receives better TV signals from the Emley Moor transmitter rather than Waltham transmitter which means the area is served by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire, both broadcast from Leeds.

Radio stations that broadcast to the area are BBC Radio Sheffield, Greatest Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Doncaster Radio and Trust AM, an online hospital radio station serving the Bassetlaw District General Hospital in Worksop.

<doc id="440827" wikidata="Q605605" url="?curid=440827" title="Borough of Broxtowe">
<text>Broxtowe is a local government district with borough status in Nottinghamshire, England. It lies immediately west of the city of Nottingham, and most of the built-up areas of the borough form part of the Nottingham Urban Area. The council is based in Beeston and the borough also includes the towns of Eastwood, Kimberley and Stapleford and surrounding villages and rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Ashfield, Nottingham, Rushcliffe, Erewash and Amber Valley.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Basford Rural District (part, being the parishes of Awsworth, Brinsley, Cossall, Greasley, Kimberley, Nuthall, Strelley and Trowell)
*Beeston and Stapleford Urban District
*Eastwood Urban District
The new district was named after the ancient Broxtowe Wapentake, which had covered a larger area. Despite the name, the district does not include the Broxtowe Estate, which is in Nottingham. The district was granted borough status in 1977, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Broxtowe Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Nottinghamshire County Council. Parts of the district are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Broxtowe. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1995 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, changes of allegiance reported in August 2023 and January 2025 and a by-election in May 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Council Offices on Foster Avenue in Beeston. The building was completed in 1991 at a cost of £2.7 million and was formally opened on 17 April 1991 by Andrew Buchanan, Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire.

==Elections==

Since the last full review of boundaries took effect in 2015, the council has comprised 44 councillors elected from 20 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors.

===Wards===
The wards are:

*Attenborough and Chilwell East
*Awsworth, Cossall and Trowell
*Beeston Central
*Beeston North
*Beeston Rylands
*Beeston West
*Bramcote
*Brinsley
*Chilwell West
*Eastwood Hall
*Eastwood Hill Top
*Eastwood St Mary&#x27;s
*Greasley
*Kimberley
*Nuthall East and Strelley
*Stapleford North
*Stapleford South East
*Stapleford South West
*Toton and Chilwell Meadows
*Watnall and Nuthall West
===Parliamentary constituency===
Since 1983 Broxtowe has also been the name of a parliamentary constituency. The constituency boundaries do not exactly match the borough boundaries, with some parts in the north of Broxtowe borough, including Eastwood and Brinsley, being in the Ashfield constituency. A Broxtowe constituency 

also existed from 1918 to 1970. The area of the former constituency was very different, including Hucknall and Kirkby in Ashfield, but excluding Beeston.

==Settlements==


Settlements include Beeston—where the council is based—Attenborough, Awsworth, Bramcote, Brinsley, Chilwell, Cossall, Eastwood, Giltbrook, Greasley, Kimberley, Moorgreen, Newthorpe, Nuthall, Stapleford, Strelley, Swingate, Toton, Trowell and Watnall. Additionally a small part of Wollaton falls within Broxtowe.

The Broxtowe Estate is not within the borough, but within the boundaries of the City of Nottingham.

===Civil parishes===

Broxtowe has nine civil parishes. The parish councils of Eastwood, Kimberley and Stapleford take the style &quot;town council&quot;. An unparished area in the south of the borough covers the town of Beeston and the neighbouring places of Chilwell, Toton, Attenborough and Bramcote, being the area of the former Beeston and Stapleford Urban District minus Stapleford, which was parished in 1987. Strelley was abolished in 2023 and is presently also unparished. The parishes are:
*Awsworth
*Brinsley
*Cossall
*Eastwood (town)
*Greasley
*Kimberley (town)
*Nuthall
*Stapleford (town)
*Trowell
==Twinning==

Broxtowe is twinned with Gütersloh in Germany.

== Local attractions ==
Broxtowe&#x27;s main visitor attraction is the D.H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum in Eastwood. A small local attraction is the Hemlock Stone in Stapleford. Broxtowe is also the location of the Attenborough Nature Reserve rated as one of the most popular nature reserves in the UK. Its visitor centre was opened in March 2005 by David Attenborough, who can trace his family back to the village of Attenborough located to the east of the visitor centre.

==Local nature reserves==
Broxtowe has 13 designated local nature reserves, namely Alexandrina Plantation (Bramcote), Bramcote Park Woodland (Bramcote), Brinsley Headstocks (Brinsley), Hall Om Wong (Kimberley), King George&#x27;s Park (Bramcote), Nottingham Canal, Sandy Lane Public Open Space (Bramcote), Smithurst Meadows (Giltbrook), Stapleford Hill Woodland (Stapleford), Toton Fields (Toton), Watnall Spinney and Watnall Green (Watnall), and Colliers Wood (Moorgreen).

<text>Michael Everett Capuano ( ; born January 9, 1952) is an American politician and attorney who served as a U.S. Representative of Massachusetts from 1999 to 2019. A Democrat, his district included the northern three-fourths of Boston, as well as parts of Cambridge, his hometown of Somerville, and other communities immediately north and south of Boston. Prior to being elected to Congress, he served as an Alderman and Mayor of Somerville.

Capuano was born and raised in Somerville. After graduating from Dartmouth College and Boston College Law School, he worked as an attorney and Somerville alderman. After losing two mayoral elections in 1979 and 1981, he worked as legal counsel for the Massachusetts General Court. In 1989 Capuano ran for mayor a third time and won, serving from 1990 to 1999.

In 1998 Capuano won a crowded Democratic primary to replace Joseph Kennedy II in Congress and was re-elected nine times. He represented the state&#x27;s 8th district until it was redrawn in 2013 into the . In Congress he was a staunch liberal and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He ran in the 2010 special election to fill the seat in the United States Senate made vacant by the death of Ted Kennedy, his Congressional predecessor&#x27;s uncle, but lost the primary to Martha Coakley, who in turn lost the general election to Republican Scott Brown. In 2018, he was defeated by Ayanna Pressley in a House Democratic primary.

In March 2019, Capuano joined the law firm Foley &amp; Lardner, to serve as public affairs director. The same month, he also joined Boston University to teach at the university&#x27;s Initiative on Cities and help organize the program.

==Early life and education==
Capuano was born January 9, 1952, in the Spring Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts, the son of Rita Marie (née Garvey) and Andrew Capuano. His father left to serve in World War II shortly after getting married, and after returning ran for the Somerville Board of Aldermen, and became the first Italian American elected to the board. His mother was of Irish descent.

Capuano graduated from Somerville High School in 1969, and later attended Dartmouth College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973. Capuano later went on to earn his Juris Doctor in 1977 from Boston College Law School, specializing in tax law.

==Early political career==
In 1976, Capuano was elected to the Somerville Board of Aldermen representing Ward 5, once served in by his father. Capuano served one term, stepping down in 1979 to run for Mayor of Somerville. In the 1979 mayoral election he faced Eugene Brune, Paul Haley, and incumbent, Thomas August. He lost the nomination to Brune, who went on to defeat August. Capuano ran again in 1981 to challenge Brune, placing second in a three-person runoff election. Capuano promoted his opposition to the state ballot question Proposition 2½ and criticized Brune for expanding the mayoral staff in the face of tight city budgets, while Brune touted his prevention of service cuts after the proposition passed. Capuano lost in the general election with 40% of the vote.

From 1978 to 1984 Capuano served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts General Court&#x27;s Joint Committee on Taxation. Capuano left the committee in 1984 to join the Beacon Hill law firm and lobbying group Joyce &amp; Joyce. In 1985 he returned to the Somerville Board of Aldermen as an at-large member.

===Mayor of Somerville===
In 1989 Capuano ran for mayor a third time and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a reputation as a hands-on administrator. One of his priorities was to lower the city&#x27;s population density, which at the time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings and replace them with playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 1998, Joseph Kennedy II announced his retirement after six terms in what was then the 8th District. Capuano entered a crowded 10-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district, which was once represented by John F. Kennedy and Tip O&#x27;Neill. The early front-runner was former Boston Mayor and US Vatican Ambassador Raymond Flynn. However, Capuano won the primary with 23%, largely due to large turnout in Somerville, all but assuring him of election in November. He easily won the general election in November, taking 81 percent of the vote. He was reelected nine times, never dropping below 80% of the vote in what has long been the most Democratic district in New England. Since his initial run for the seat, Capuano was unopposed in all but two reelection bids; he faced a minor-party candidate in 2006 and an independent in 2012. He faced a Republican only once, during his initial run in 1998.

====2018 election====

Capuano was defeated by Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley in the September 4, 2018, primary election, receiving 41.3% of the vote versus Pressley&#x27;s 58.5%. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Capuano did not get the endorsement of either U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, nor was he endorsed by Representatives Seth Moulton and Niki Tsongas. Capuano did receive the support of the majority of the Massachusetts federal delegation, including Representatives William Keating, Katherine Clark, James McGovern, Joseph Kennedy III, Stephen Lynch, and Richard Neal. Capuano was endorsed by Congressman John Lewis (D-GA), on March 7, 2018; Lewis described Capuano as &quot;a champion and fierce advocate for those who have often been forgotten or left behind&quot; and &quot;a leader alongside those of us opposing the unfair and immoral policies of the Trump Administration.&quot; In its editorial endorsement of Pressley, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; noted that the state Legislature had drawn the 7th district to favor minority candidates. No Republican even filed, all but assuring Pressley of being the district&#x27;s next congresswoman.

===Tenure===

During his tenure, Capuano helped found five congressional caucuses, on: Community Health Centers; Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities; Sudan; and Korea; as well as one for former Mayors.

Capuano voted against the War in Iraq and supported immediate withdrawal of troops. In 2005 Capuano visited Iraq and met with military leaders to assess the future of the region. Capuano is considered to be one of the biggest supporters in Congress for increasing international aid funding, and has advocated bringing attention to the crisis in Sudan and helped secure funding aimed at assisting developing African nations.

Capuano is pro-choice and supports open access to abortions. In 2012 a fundraiser hosted by Pope John XXIII High School where Capuano and fellow Massachusetts Congressman Ed Markey were to receive awards was cancelled due to their &quot;positions [being] inconsistent with church doctrine;&quot; both were humble in response to the news. During the 2010 Senate Democratic primary Capuano criticized his opponent Martha Coakley, claiming she wouldn&#x27;t have voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with Stupak–Pitts Amendment which would have barred federal funding of abortions; which Capuano said he only did to &quot;keep the health care debate alive.&quot; Capuano&#x27;s comments were characterized by WBUR political analyst as &quot;an empty charge against her since he has the same position as she does.&quot;

After the 2006 election that created a Democratic majority in the House, he was appointed Chairman of the Speaker&#x27;s Task Force on Ethics Enforcement by Nancy Pelosi, with whom he has a close relationship. After serving as the Chairman of the Task Force on Ethics Enforcement, in 2008 Capuano introduced which established the Office of Congressional Ethics. Capuano has had a long-running relationship with former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whom he shared a Washington, D.C. apartment with for 12 years. Following Weiner&#x27;s sexting scandal Capuano did not call on him to resign, saying: &quot;I am not the guy who likes to judge other people. I figure that is between them and the people who are appropriately named to do that – and that is the Ethics Committee.&quot;

Capuano is a strong supporter of labor rights and unions; in February 2011 during a rally at Beacon Hill in Boston, in support of the 2011 Wisconsin budget protests, Capuano told the crowd, &quot;I&#x27;m proud to be here with people who understand that it&#x27;s more than just sending an email to get you going. Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary&quot;. Following criticism, especially when such a statement was made just days after the attempted assassination of Gabby Giffords, Capuano expressed regret for his &quot;choice of words.&quot;

Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bank bailouts, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Capuano berated the bank CEOs for their practices, saying at one point: &quot;You come to us today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa and telling us, &#x27;We&#x27;re sorry, we didn&#x27;t mean it, we won&#x27;t do it again, trust us.&#x27; Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks and they say the same thing.&quot; Capuano&#x27;s speech was included in the 2010 documentary film &quot;Inside Job&quot;, described by director Charles H. Ferguson as being about &quot;the systemic corruption of the United States by the financial services industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption.&quot;

A self-described &quot;fiscal conservative&quot; who opposed the Bush-era tax cuts that provided tax reductions for the wealthy because they &quot;created a deficit for no good reason,&quot; in 2013 Capuano joined Senator Elizabeth Warren and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in a rally against the then-upcoming sequester, with Capuano calling it &quot;stupid.&quot; In 2012 Capuano along with fellow Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank introduced legislation to combine the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the &quot;Securities and Derivatives Commission.&quot;

Capuano was a member of the Congressional Arts Caucus and the U.S.-Japan Caucus.

==Campaigns for higher office==

===1994 Secretary nomination===
Capuano ran for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth in the 1994 election, running against former State Representatives Augusto Grace and William F. Galvin for the Democratic nomination. During the race he framed himself as an advocate for the poor and urban communities, and criticized aid formulas which he argued left less-wealthy municipalities with less per-capita revenue. To appear on the Democratic primary required the support of at least 15% of delegates in the state party convention. In what the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; deemed &quot;an embarrassing defeat,&quot; he failed to obtain the necessary delegate votes to be nominated to participate in the primary election, with only 13%. When asked why he undertook the difficult race to begin with, he responded, &quot;Because I wasn&#x27;t ready to run for Governor.&quot;

===2010 Senate campaign===
After the death of incumbent Senator Ted Kennedy, a special election to succeed him was scheduled. On September 8, 2009, Capuano collected nomination papers to run for the seat and on September 18, he announced his candidacy. Capuano ran as a &quot;Washington insider,&quot; comparing himself to Kennedy saying: &quot;was [Kennedy] not the ultimate insider ... I think that&#x27;s probably one of the best things that we share.&quot; In his campaign Capuano received several high-profile endorsements, including House Speaker Pelosi and former Massachusetts Governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis.

Consistently polling below incumbent Massachusetts Attorney General, Martha Coakley, on December 8, 2009, Capuano lost the Democratic primary to Coakley, winning only 28% of the vote to Coakley&#x27;s 47%, amongst a field of four candidates.

===2014 gubernatorial election===

Capuano considered running for Governor of Massachusetts in 2014. On January 21, 2013, former mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts, and member of the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: &quot;while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [Democratic] nomination [for Governor] at this time, it is not too early to make the case and encourage his candidacy.&quot; When asked in February 2013 whether he might run for governor, Capuano responded: &quot;Part of me thinks that some of the more interesting, more important fights over the next several years might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill.&quot; In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress.

==Personal life==
Capuano was named after his two grandfathers, and has seven siblings, one of whom died in infancy, and another who died of polio at the age of 5. Capuano married Barbara Teebagy in 1974, and together they have two sons: Michael and Joseph. He is the uncle of actors Chris Evans of the &quot;Captain America&quot; film series, and Scott Evans of the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; through his sister Lisa. In 2003, the City of Somerville dedicated a new school in Capuano&#x27;s honor; the Michael E. Capuano Early Childhood Center officially opened in September that year.

Capuano is a Roman Catholic. Before Pope Francis became pope and shifted the tone of the Church, Capuano used to fear that his mother would be embarrassed if he was ever denied communion because of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.

<doc id="440836" wikidata="Q2344921" url="?curid=440836" title="Stephen Lynch (politician)">
<text>Stephen Francis Lynch (born March 31, 1955) is an American businessman, attorney and politician who has served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts since 2001. A Democrat, he represents Massachusetts&#x27;s 8th congressional district, which includes the southern fourth of Boston and many of its southern suburbs. Lynch was previously an ironworker and lawyer, and served in both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court.

Born and raised in South Boston, Lynch is the son of an ironworker. He went into the trade after high school, working in an apprenticeship and later joining his father&#x27;s union. He became the union&#x27;s youngest president, at age 30, while attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology. He received his J.D. from Boston College Law School in 1991. For several years, he worked as a lawyer, primarily representing housing project residents and labor unions. In 1994, Lynch was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. During his tenure, his progressive views and advocacy for South Boston helped propel him to the Massachusetts Senate in 1995, when he won a special election to succeed state senator William Bulger.

Lynch won a special election to represent the state&#x27;s 9th district in the United States House of Representatives in 2001, and has been reelected ever since. His district was redrawn into the 8th district in 2013. He sits on the Financial Services and Oversight and Government Reform Committees. Lynch ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2013 special election for the U.S. Senate, losing to Ed Markey.

Lynch is currently a part of the Democratic Congressional Progressive Caucus. 

==Early life, education, and business career==
The fourth of six children, Lynch was born on March 31, 1955, in the neighborhood of South Boston. He was raised with his five sisters in the Old Colony Housing Project. His father, Francis Lynch, was an ironworker who dropped out of school in eighth grade. His mother, Anne (née Havlin), was a night-shift post office worker. Both parents came from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and South Boston High School. During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice ironworker. For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the country for various companies, including General Motors and U.S. Steel.

In 1977 Lynch was arrested for smoking marijuana at a Willie Nelson concert at the Illinois State Fair, leading to a $50 misdemeanor fine. In 1979 he was arrested for assault and battery of six Iranian students attending an anti-American protest in Boston, a charge that was later dropped. Around this time, he developed &quot;a problem with alcohol&quot;, leading him to join Alcoholics Anonymous. (He reportedly left AA after meeting his future wife several years later, but continued to attend occasional meetings through the 2000s.)

Having personal experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch developed aspirations beyond his trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s, he was elected to the executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30, he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local&#x27;s history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in construction management in 1988.

That year Lynch led a three-week labor strike, refusing to sign a contract with the Associated General Contractors despite pressure from within his union. The union international ultimately signed the contract without Lynch&#x27;s approval, causing him to file suit against them. He later remarked, &quot;Nothing I ever do will be as volatile as being union president during those times.&quot; The incident forced him to miss the first three weeks of classes at Boston College Law School, where he had enrolled. Nevertheless, he graduated with a J.D. in 1991. After graduating he joined the law office of Gabriel O. Dumont, Jr., representing labor unions and unemployed workers.

Throughout law school and the following years, he often worked &quot;pro bono&quot;, representing housing project residents at Boston Housing Authority (BHA) hearings. In one high-profile 1994 case, Lynch provided free legal services to 14 teenagers, all white, who were accused of physically attacking a Hispanic teenager and harassing the family of his white girlfriend over a period of six months. Lynch claimed the youths had been &quot;overcharged&quot; and helped some of them avoid criminal charges and eviction by the BHA.

Lynch was a onetime tax delinquent. In the mid-1980s the city of Boston placed liens on four properties he owned due to several thousand dollars of unpaid property taxes. He owed Massachusetts $2,000 in overdue taxes from 1985 to 1988, and for several years owed the IRS $4,000.

==Massachusetts House of Representatives==

With numerous cases under his belt, Lynch developed a reputation in his community, and friends encouraged him to run for office. In early 1994 he phoned Paul J. Gannon, the Democratic state representative from the 4th Suffolk district, to announce a run against him. While both candidates were labor advocates with similar backgrounds, Lynch called himself &quot;the conservative candidate&quot;. He criticized Gannon for not supporting the Veterans Council, which had prevented a gay rights group from marching in the local St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade. Lynch&#x27;s base of supporters in the projects allowed him to win the Democratic primary by 600 votes before he went on win the general election.

As a state representative, Lynch was a vocal advocate for his neighborhood. He opposed a plan by Governor Bill Weld and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to construct a $200 million football stadium by the publicly owned South Boston waterfront. He led the opposition to a proposed asphalt plant in South Bay, and sponsored an amendment to a state bond bill that banned its construction.

==Massachusetts Senate==
When President of the Massachusetts Senate William Bulger announced his resignation from his 1st Suffolk seat in late 1995, Lynch filed nomination papers for the special election to replace him. Bulger&#x27;s son, attorney William M. Bulger, Jr., also ran for the seat, as did another lawyer, Patrick Loftus. The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual respect. Lynch won the March 1996 primary, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56%–35%–9%. In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96%–4%, and he was inaugurated on May 1, 1996. He was reelected unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2000.

As a state senator, Lynch continued to lead opposition to the proposed football stadium and vocally opposed a proposal to sell the publicly owned Marine Industrial Park. He opposed a hate-crimes bill that would have made racially charged language a felony, and hearkened back to the 1994 racial violence case as an example, arguing that the bill &quot;attacks merely words&quot; and &quot;prosecutes young people who, in my opinion, haven&#x27;t developed the responsibility and wisdom to measure their words.&quot; On the Senate Transportation Committee, Lynch cosponsored a bill in June 1996 to allow certain Boston residents unlimited access to the Ted Williams Tunnel. In 1997 he was named Senate Chairman of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Labor. In response to a budget crisis in the state&#x27;s nursing homes, due primarily to Medicaid shortfalls, Lynch filed an unsuccessful bill in April 2001 to increase Medicaid funding by $200 million. While in the Senate, he enrolled at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, from which he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in 1999. Massachusetts law prohibits any elected official from holding more than one office. Following his election to Congress, Lynch resigned on October 16, 2001 and was sworn in as a member of Congress on the same day.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2001====

Lynch announced his candidacy for the 9th district seat in 2001, when longtime incumbent U.S. Representative Joe Moakley, stricken with leukemia, decided not to seek a 17th term. This was a departure from Lynch&#x27;s previous plan to run for lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Moakley died in May 2001, before his term ended, and Lynch announced a run for the special election to succeed him. The early front-runner in the race was lawyer Max Kennedy, son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, but his withdrawal from the race in June 2001 put Lynch in the lead. The remaining candidates included eight Democrats and two Republicans. All the remaining candidates had similar political positions and according to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the candidates &quot;struggled to find areas of conflict&quot; when debating.

Lynch&#x27;s main opponents in the primary were State Senators Cheryl Jacques, Brian A. Joyce and Marc R. Pacheco. During the campaign, Lynch faced criticism as his past improprieties were uncovered, including two arrests, defaulting on student loans, and a history of tax delinquency. Gay rights advocates attacked him for &quot;a history of supporting anti-gay legislation.&quot; Still, Lynch maintained strong local support going into the primary. As he pulled ahead in polls and fundraising, Jacques and Joyce attacked him suggesting was not supportive of civil rights.

On September 11, 2001, Lynch won the Democratic primary with 39% of the vote to Jacques&#x27;s 29%. The same day, the September 11 attacks took place, which dampened the ensuing general election race between Lynch and the Republican nominee, state Senator Jo Ann Sprague. On October 16, he defeated Sprague, 65%-33%.

====Electoral history====
===Tenure===
Lynch was sworn into the 107th Congress on October 23, 2001. The ceremony had been delayed for a weekend, as the 2001 anthrax attacks had led to a shutdown of Congressional office buildings. In a press conference after his swearing-in, Lynch remarked on the unlikelihood of his career path, comparing himself to Jed Clampett of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. He is a moderate Democrat by Massachusetts standards, but a fairly liberal one by national standards. He generally votes more moderate on social issues and liberal on economic and environmental issues. &quot;Calling me the least liberal member from Massachusetts is like calling me the slowest Kenyan in the Boston Marathon&quot;, he said in 2010. &quot;It&#x27;s all relative.&quot; He is strongly pro-labor and has focused on bringing manufacturing jobs to his district. He is a co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus.

Lynch voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Capital Markets
**Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion (Ranking Member)
* Committee on Oversight and Accountability
**Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs
*Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government

===Caucus memberships===

* Afterschool Caucuses
* Climate Solutions Caucus

* Congressional Blockchain Caucus
* Rare Disease Caucus

===Political positions===
====Economy and finance====
Lynch has been a member of the House Financial Services Committee since his first term. According to CQ, Lynch supported President George W. Bush&#x27;s agenda one-third of the time, which was average for Democratic House members. For instance, he supported the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which addressed the subprime mortgage crisis, but opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s economic agenda, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

Lynch has focused on trade policy as a congressman. In 2002 he voted against fast track bills that gave the president the authority to negotiate trade deals without amendments by Congress. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Peru–United States Trade Promotion Agreement despite some Democratic opposition.

====Domestic policy====
Lynch has sat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, formerly called the Government Reform Committee, throughout his House career. He chaired the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Post Office, and the District of Columbia from 2009 to 2010. On this subcommittee he has dealt with federal employee recruitment, salary, and benefits.

Lynch advocates health care reform but split with his party on Obama&#x27;s health care reform efforts. He voted in November 2009 to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act (AHCAA), the House&#x27;s health care reform bill. This bill was scrapped by Congressional leaders in favor of the Senate&#x27;s bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Despite pressure from Obama and Democratic leaders, Lynch said he would oppose the PPACA until &quot;they put reform back in the health reform bill.&quot; He described the Senate bill as a &quot;surrender&quot; to insurance companies, putting too little pressure on them to reduce costs. He explained, &quot;There&#x27;s a difference between compromise and surrender, right? And this is a complete surrender of all the things that people thought were important to health care reform.&quot; When the PPACA came to a House vote in March 2010, he was the only U.S. representative from New England to vote against it.

On social issues, Lynch was considered a conservative to moderate Democrat in the 2000s. He was anti-abortion, once condemned by the pro-choice group NARAL. He sided with conservatives in the 2005 Terri Schiavo case, voting for federal court intervention. In more recent years, he has advocated and defended funding for Planned Parenthood. In 2021, Lynch voted for the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, signifying a significant shift in his position on the issue.

Lynch has mostly sided with Democratic leaders on gay rights issues, opposing a Federal Marriage Amendment and supporting granting medical benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. He supports same-sex marriage. Lynch&#x27;s 2022 reelection campaign touted his support for the Equality Act; he is also a member of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus.

In September 2016, Lynch announced on WBUR that he would vote for the November 2016 ballot question that sought to expand the number of charter schools in the state.

On January 3, 2021, the beginning of the 117th Congress, Lynch became the last remaining incumbent House Democrat to have voted against the Affordable Care Act.

In 2025, Lynch was one of 46 House Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

==== 2020 coronavirus response efforts ====
During an April 2020 House Oversight Committee Hearing that included testimony from Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Lynch grew angry over federal miscommunications about the availability of coronavirus testing, and said that cases of COVID-19 had doubled in his district just the day before. Earlier that month, he co-signed a letter with the Massachusetts congressional delegation asking FEMA to release enough ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile to Massachusetts hospitals, as the state was bracing for a surge of COVID-19 cases at that time.

Lynch has also been interested in improving the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). On April 23, 2020, he introduced the Strategic National Stockpile Enhancement and Transparency Act (HR 6607). The bill would create a new initiative, the National Emergency Biodefense Network, that would work to ensure, at a state level and with state partners, that each state had enough supplies for emergencies such as pandemics.

====Foreign policy and veterans====
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee had oversight of airport security and some elements of the War in Afghanistan. Lynch sat on the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee for his first term. He has several Veterans&#x27;s Affairs (VA) hospitals in his district, and sponsored legislation to increase nurse staffing and allow private physician prescriptions to be filled at VA hospitals.

A supporter of American intervention in the Middle East, Lynch has made 12 trips to Iraq and ten to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part of these visits&#x27; purpose was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects. He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He supported Obama&#x27;s drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011 and Obama&#x27;s renewal of the War in Afghanistan, the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama&#x27;s Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but, along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, pushed for strict oversight of the aid&#x27;s distribution.

Lynch supports lifting the United States&#x27; economic sanctions on Cuba. Moakley, his predecessor, was heavily involved in Latin American affairs, and Lynch has made an effort to continue this work. He joined five other congressmen on a 2002 visit to Cuba, where they met with President Fidel Castro.

====John Adams Memorial====
Lynch supports the creation of a national memorial to John Adams in Washington, D.C. Adams, a native of Massachusetts, was the first vice president of the United States and second president. In 2017, he sponsored legislation to form an Adams Memorial Commission to develop and build such a memorial.

== U.S. Senate campaigns ==
Upon the death of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts state law triggered a special election to be held in January 2010. On September 4, 2009, a representative for Lynch took out nomination papers in preparation of a special election run. After speaking with his family and citing the short time frame in which to conduct a campaign, Lynch decided not to seek the Democratic nomination for the seat.

Lynch announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on January 31, 2013, seeking to fill the seat then held by John Kerry, who had resigned to become U.S. Secretary of State. Lynch&#x27;s candidacy in the 2013 special election had been portrayed as an uphill battle against Representative Ed Markey, who had a larger war chest and several major party endorsements. A &quot;Politico&quot; profile compared Lynch&#x27;s &quot;common-man touch&quot; and moderate views to that of Republican Scott Brown, who won the 2010 special Senate election by connecting with independent voters. Lynch lost to Markey in the April 30 Democratic primary.

==Personal life==
Lynch dated Margaret Shaughnessy for 10 years before the two married in 1992. An aide to state Senator Marian Walsh, Shaughnessy was from another South Boston family, one of seven children, and majored in graphic design at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. She went to high school with Lynch&#x27;s sisters, and she and Lynch were members of the South Boston Residents Group. , the Lynches live in South Boston with their daughter and a niece. For most of his career, Lynch has been listed in the member&#x27;s roll as &quot;D-South Boston&quot;.

He is first cousins with Boston-based restaurateur Barbara Lynch.

<text>William David Delahunt (; July 18, 1941March 30, 2024) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives representing from 1997 to 2011. Delahunt did not seek re-election in 2010, and left Congress in January 2011. He was succeeded by Norfolk County District Attorney Bill Keating.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Delahunt was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, on July 18, 1941. He was educated at Thayer Academy, Middlebury College, and Boston College Law School. He served as a radarman (RD3) in the United States Coast Guard in 1963 and the United States Coast Guard Reserve from 1963 to 1971.

Delahunt was elected as a town councillor for Quincy, taking office in January 1972. He served a term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975 before serving as district attorney of Norfolk County from 1975 to 1996.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1996, Democratic Congressman Gerry Studds decided to retire. Delahunt decided to run for Massachusetts&#x27;s 10th congressional district. On September 17, 1996, Delahunt won the Democratic primary election with a plurality of 38% of the vote. He won the Plymouth County portion of the district, while losing the Norfolk County portion. He narrowly defeated state legislator Philip W Johnston of Marshfield by just 119 votes after a recount, which was conducted in a handful of contested towns. Following the recount, Delahunt sought judicial review in the Massachusetts Superior Court. After reviewing about 900 ballots, Judge Elizabeth B. Donovan declared Delahunt the victor. The case was appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which upheld the lower court ruling. The case had the issue of &quot;hanging chads&quot; in punch-card voting machines. On November 5, 1996, Delahunt defeated Republican state Representative Edward B. Teague III 54%–42%.

Delahunt won re-election six times, defeating his opponent by at least 32 percentage points each time. On March 4, 2010, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; confirmed that Delahunt would retire that year rather than seek reelection for an eighth term. Shortly before the announcement of his retirement, it was discovered that Delahunt, while serving as district attorney for Norfolk County, Massachusetts, had refused to file charges against Amy Bishop for shooting and killing her brother in 1986. On February 12, 2010, Bishop murdered three of her colleagues at the University of Alabama in Huntsville after being denied tenure.

===Tenure===
As one of his first initiatives in Congress, Delahunt created the bipartisan caucus on the United States Coast Guard in 1999, which he co-chaired with two other Coast Guard veterans, Reps. Howard Coble (R-NC) and Gene Taylor (D-MS). This benefited his district through getting the problems of outpaced resources and security recognized at the ports of Massachusetts.

In November 2005, Delahunt met with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez to arrange an assistance program in which Venezuela would supply winter home heating oil at a 40 percent price reduction to thousands of low-income Massachusetts residents. The program, which has since been expanded to help 500,000 people across the U.S., was carried out via the Venezuelan owned Citgo, and brought accusations that Delahunt was assisting an anti-American leader. Delahunt, however, sometimes criticized Chávez, such as in a September 2006 letter expressing disgust at a speech given by Chávez to the United Nations, in which he personally attacked President George W. Bush, calling it &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot;.

In the 110th U.S. Congress, Delahunt served as the chair of the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight.

Delahunt was a consistent opponent of the war in Iraq. However, on March 10, 2010, he voted against a measure to bring troops home from Afghanistan.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Foreign Affairs
** Subcommittee on Europe(Chairman 111th Congress)
** Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight (Chairman 110th Congress)
* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law
** Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security
** Task Force on Judicial Impeachment

===Caucus memberships===
* Co-chair of the bipartisan Coast Guard Caucus
* Co-chair of the House Older Americans Caucus
* Co-chair of the Congressional Working Group on Cuba

Delahunt was a member of the United States House Foreign Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee, House Older Americans Caucus, and the Congressional Working Group on Cuba. In 1999, he co-founded the bipartisan Coast Guard Caucus. The Coast Guard presented him with their Distinguished Public Service Award in June 2010.

==Post-congressional career==

===Lobbying===
Upon Delahunt&#x27;s retirement, he formed the Delahunt Group, a lobbying firm (&quot;multi-service consulting firm focused on Government Affairs, International Market Entry Strategies, Corporate and Development Advisory, Federal and State Funding, and Appropriations, Regulatory and Permitting Assistance, Public Policy Strategies and Public Relations&quot;). Delahunt told the &quot;Cape Cod Times&quot; that he viewed it as an extension of his work in Congress. As a legislator, he explained, he set policy at a macro level. Now, he said: &quot;we&#x27;re taking that and bringing it down here to the communities, to encourage implementation. We&#x27;re working with the private sector and the public sector in a way that&#x27;s a win-win for everyone.&quot; He told the &quot;Times&quot; he was particularly interested in work that encourages regional tourism and economic development.&quot;

Less than two months after leaving Congress, Delahunt lobbied on behalf of the Wampanoag people in Massachusetts to help them secure Indian gaming rights with the state legislature. Delahunt filled a gap left by the Wampanoag&#x27;s previous lobbyist Jack Abramoff following his conviction associated with the renowned Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. Delahunt received over $15,000 in campaign contributions from the Wampanoag and Abramoff prior to leaving office sparking criticisms from good government advocates and casino opponents. While Delahunt was precluded by law from lobbying the Congress for at least one year, rules did not preclude him from lobbying state legislatures.

Delahunt formally announced his retirement from Congress in March 2010. Between March and December 2010, he made over $10,000 in campaign contributions to Massachusetts state legislators from his federal congressional PAC – a 500 percent increase from previous years&#x27; contributions.

Delahunt also established a lobbying partnership with the Washington, DC–based Prime Policy Group on ways American companies can establish themselves in foreign countries while helping foreign businesses with connections to in United States markets. Prime Policy Group&#x27;s clients include companies like Accenture, which have been criticized for moving offshore to avoid paying U.S. taxes. This partnership dovetails with Delahunt&#x27;s work on behalf of the Wampanoag as their primary backers are the Malaysian gambling giant Genting Group. Genting is seeking to establish a foothold in the United States with ventures in New York, Miami and Massachusetts. The Wampanoag venture, if approved, would give Genting a tax-free foothold in Indian gaming in the United States.

===Medical marijuana===
Delahunt, who was President of Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts Inc., applied for three medical marijuana dispensary licenses from the Massachusetts state Department of Public Health. The businesses would be located in Mashpee, Plymouth and Taunton. The locations were all planned to be in separate counties, so they would not compete with each other in the selection process.

Delahunt supported the creation of medical marijuana dispensaries to thwart the rise in prescription drug abuse. He was also significantly involved in the operations of any of the dispensaries that Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts opens.

In September 2014, Delahunt resigned from his position as President of Medical Marijuana of Massachusetts Inc. after the licenses for his planned dispensaries were rejected by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

===Harvard Institute of Politics===
In late May 2017, Delahunt became the acting director of the Harvard Institute of Politics.

===Diplomacy===
In 2013, Delahunt helped free a U.S. citizen who was imprisoned by the Venezuelan government.

==Personal life and death==
Delahunt&#x27;s paternal grandfather immigrated to the United States from Canada and his paternal grandmother&#x27;s family was Irish.

Bill Delahunt and his wife, Katharina, divorced in 1986. They had one daughter, Kristin, and adopted another, Kara Mai (&quot;née&quot; Nguyen Mai Tai Trang), from Vietnam in 1975. While Congress was in session, Delahunt lived in a rented house with fellow Democratic politicians George Miller, Chuck Schumer, and Richard Durbin. 

At the time of his death, he was in a relationship with Julie Pagano.

Delahunt died at his Quincy home on March 30, 2024, at the age of 82.

<doc id="440850" wikidata="Q159684" url="?curid=440850" title="Virgil Goode">
<text>Virgil Hamlin Goode Jr. ( born October 17, 1946) is an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 5th congressional district of Virginia from 1997 to 2009. He was initially a Democrat, but became an independent in 2000 and switched to the Republican Party in 2002. He was narrowly defeated in 2008 by Democrat Tom Perriello.

In 2012, he was the presidential nominee of the Constitution Party, receiving 122,388 votes or 0.09% of the total.

==Early life and education==
Goode was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Alice Clara (born Besecker) and Virgil Hamlin Goode Sr. However, he has spent most of his life in Rocky Mount, south of Roanoke.

His father served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1940 to 1948 and as commonwealth&#x27;s attorney of Franklin County from 1948 to 1972; between them, father and son represented Franklin County at either the local, state or federal level with only one year&#x27;s interruption from 1940 to 2009. Goode graduated with a B.A. from the University of Richmond (Phi Beta Kappa) and with a J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law. He also is a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and served in the Army National Guard from 1969 to 1975.

==Virginia Senate==
Goode grew up as a Democrat. He entered politics soon after graduating from law school. At the age of 27, he won a special election to the state Senate from a Southside district as an independent after the death of the multi-term Democratic incumbent, William F. Stone. One of Goode&#x27;s major campaign focuses was advocacy for the Equal Rights Amendment. Soon after being elected, he joined the Democrats.

Goode was very conservative even by Virginia Democratic standards of the time. As such, he wore his party ties very loosely. He supported the tobacco industry, worrying that &quot;his elderly mother would be denied &#x27;the one last pleasure&#x27; of smoking a cigarette on her hospital deathbed.&quot; Goode ardently defended gun rights while also enthusiastically supporting L. Douglas Wilder, who later became the first elected black governor of Virginia. At the Democratic Party&#x27;s state political convention in 1985, Goode nominated Wilder for lieutenant governor. However, while governor, Wilder cracked down on gun sales in the state.

After the 1995 elections resulted in a 20–20 split between Democrats and Republicans in the State Senate, Goode seriously considered voting with the Republicans on organizing the chamber. Had he done so, the State Senate would have been under Republican control for the first time since Reconstruction (Republicans ultimately won control outright in 1999). Goode&#x27;s actions at the time &quot;forced his party to share power with Republican lawmakers in the state legislature,&quot; which further upset the Democratic Party.

==U.S. Senate elections==

===1982===
Independent incumbent U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. decided to retire. Goode ran for the seat, but lost the nomination, getting just 8% of the vote. Lieutenant Governor Richard Joseph Davis won the convention with 64% of the vote. Davis lost the general election by a two-point margin.

===1994===

He decided to run for the U.S. Senate again in 1994, to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Robb in the Democratic primary. He angered much of the leadership of the Virginia Democratic Party during his second run. On June 14, Robb defeated Goode 58%–34%.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
;1996

When incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Lewis Payne decided to retire in 1996, Goode won the Democratic nomination to succeed him. His state senate district was virtually co-extensive with the southern portion of the congressional district. He defeated Republican nominee George Landrith, an attorney, 61%–36%.

;1998
Goode won re-election to a second term unopposed.

;2000
Prior to the election, Goode switched from a Democrat to an independent. He portrayed himself as a congressman who was &quot;as independent as the people he serves.&quot; He won re-election to a third term with 67% of the vote.

;2002
For the 2001 congressional redistricting, Goode allied with Republican Bob Goodlatte and Democrat Rick Boucher to ensure that none of them would be put in the same district. Goode&#x27;s home in Franklin County is only about south of Goodlatte&#x27;s home in Roanoke, the heart of the . The counties to the west of Franklin County were in Boucher&#x27;s , which had to expand due to lack of population growth.

Having become a Republican in August 2002, Goode won the Republican nomination and won re-election to a fourth term with 63% of the vote. He was the first Republican to represent this district since 1889.

;2004
He won re-election to a fifth term with 64% of the vote, defeating Vietnam War veteran and businessman Al Weed.

;2006

He won re-election to a sixth term with 59% of the vote against Weed again.

;2008

In 2008 Goode lost his seat, being defeated by Democrat Tom Perriello by 727 votes (0.24% of over 316,000 votes cast). While Goode won 13 of the district&#x27;s 20 counties and independent cities, the race was decided in the district&#x27;s more urbanized areas. Goode won only one independent city in the district, Bedford, but by only 16 votes. Ultimately, Goode could not overcome a combined 19,000-vote deficit in the Charlottesville area (Charlottesville and surrounding Albemarle County), where Perriello is from. Goode mostly held his own in the district&#x27;s strongly conservative southwestern portion, parts of which he had represented for 35 years at the state and federal level.

;2010

Goode had filed paperwork with the Federal Election Committee to allow him to raise money for a possible rematch in the 2010 elections, due to receiving &quot;unsolicited&quot; campaign contributions, though he said he had not decided whether or not he would run in 2010. However, Goode announced in late July 2009 that he would not seek the Republican nomination for the seat in 2010. Nonetheless, many expected this race to be heavily targeted by the Republican Party in 2010; it was won by Republican Robert Hurt that year.

===Tenure===
During his first two terms, he compiled one of the most conservative records of any Democrat in the Congress. Like many Southern Democrats, Goode strongly opposed abortion and gun control and vigorously supported the tobacco industry. His contrarian streak resulted in him being isolated within the Democratic caucus, which later led to him switching parties.

Goode came under considerable fire shortly after being unopposed for a second term in 1998, when he voted for three of the four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. In January 2000, he declared himself an independent and began caucusing with the Republicans, who gave him a seat on the Appropriations Committee. Republicans had been lobbying him to switch parties since 1998. Reflecting on Goode&#x27;s record at the time, David Brown, the mayor of Charlottesville and a former chairman of the city&#x27;s Democratic Party said &quot;It was obvious he didn&#x27;t really fit in the Democratic Party anymore.&quot; He officially joined the GOP in August 2002.

Goode&#x27;s primary policy initiatives were opposition to amnesty for undocumented immigrants, veterans&#x27; healthcare, and the enactment in 2004 of a $9.6 billion (~$ in ) buyout for tobacco farmers. Goode has sponsored legislation to permit deployment of the U.S. Armed Forces to the U.S.-Mexico border. He voted in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War and in support of an $87 billion (~$ in ) Iraq War supplemental spending bill.

Goode is an advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

Goode voted in 2007 against a resolution opposing the increase in troop numbers in Iraq, saying that he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;aid and assist the Islamic jihadists who want the green flag of the crescent and star to wave over the Capitol of the United States and over the White House of this country&quot; and that &quot;radical Muslims&quot; wanted to control the world and put &quot;In Muhammad We Trust&quot; on American currency.

;Liberty caucus
Goode served on the Liberty Caucus (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a group of libertarian-leaning congressional representatives. Other members at that time included Ron Paul of Texas, Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Zach Wamp of Tennessee, and Jeff Flake of Arizona. In the 2008 Republican primary elections for President, the Federal Election Commission reported that Goode donated $500 (~$ in ) to Republican candidate Ron Paul.

;MZM
In 2005, Goode faced questions when a major corporate campaign donor, defense contractor MZM, Inc., was implicated in a bribery scandal that resulted in the criminal conviction and resignation of California congressman Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham. Although Goode insisted that his relations with MZM were motivated solely by his interest in bringing high-paying skilled jobs to his district, in December of that year he donated the $88,000 received in MZM contributions to regional charities.

On July 21, 2006 Richard Berglund, a former supervisor of the Martinsville, Virginia office of MZM Inc., pleaded guilty to making illegal donations to Goode&#x27;s campaign. Court papers indicated that Berglund and MZM owner Mitchell Wade (who previously pleaded guilty) engaged in a scheme to reimburse MZM employees for campaign donations. There was no allegation of wrongdoing on the part of Goode&#x27;s campaign.

;2006 Qur&#x27;an controversy
In 2006, Minnesota&#x27;s 5th congressional district elected Keith Ellison as the first Muslim to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some criticized Ellison&#x27;s intended use of the Qur&#x27;an once owned by Thomas Jefferson at a private swearing-in ceremony; among them, Goode was vocal in his opposition to Ellison&#x27;s plan. One of Goode&#x27;s constituents posted a letter online from the congressman regarding Ellison. The letter reads in part:

When I raise my hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not subscribe to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don&#x27;t wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Koran.

Ellison criticized Goode for this letter, stating that he is not an immigrant and that Goode does not understand Islam. Ellison also offered to meet with Goode to discuss the matter. On his first day in office, Ellison sought out Goode and initiated a cordial exchange on the House floor.

In interviews around that time, Goode stated that he was in favor of decreasing legal immigration to the United States and that he wanted to do away with Diversity Immigrant Visas. Goode argued that such visas would allow people &quot;not from European countries&quot; or from &quot;some terrorist states&quot; to enter America. Goode also repeated his views on a January 1, 2007 post to the &quot;USA Today&quot; blog.

;Hummer accusation
At the 2008 Independence Day parade in Scottsville, Virginia, independent supporters of Goode drove a Hummer H3 decorated with signs promoting Goode and Robert B. Bell. With gas prices at $4 a gallon, a supporter of Goode&#x27;s opponent, Tom Perriello, put video of the parade on YouTube, accusing Goode of being out of touch with ordinary citizens grappling with the high cost of fuel.

Goode never rode in the Hummer, and is not known to have had anything to do with it, but he was widely portrayed as having both owned and operated the vehicle. He was lampooned on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for the story.

;North Theatre controversy

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development grant that Goode assisted in bringing to the North Theatre project was received by the North Theatre organization in 2005.

The &quot;Danville Register &amp; Bee&quot; reported that Goode&#x27;s press secretary as well as his wife Lucy were both on the founding board of the North Theatre. Virgil Goode checked with the House ethics committee, before Duncan or his wife Lucy went onto the North Theatre board. In the light of the controversy, Lucy Goode stepped down from the board.

In 2003, Duncan told the &quot;Register &amp; Bee&quot; he didn&#x27;t see any conflict with the earmarked dollars. &quot;I don&#x27;t even know how a question of a conflict even arises,&quot; he said.

;Sabato earmark controversy
In June 2009, it was revealed that political scientist Larry Sabato, of the Center for Politics, had been the recipient of over $7 million in earmark money from Goode, who Sabato predicted would win re-election in 2008, despite declining poll numbers; Goode ultimately lost the race by a small margin. Some observers have suggested that Sabato should have revealed his financial connection to Goode or recused himself from making predictions about the race.

===Committee assignments===
* House Appropriations Committee

==2012 presidential campaign==
In November 2010, Goode joined the executive committee of the Constitution Party, having previously been a member of the party&#x27;s larger national committee. He told the &quot;Roanoke Times&quot; in June 2011 that he would &quot;consider [running for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination] as the year progresses.&quot;

Goode filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as a presidential candidate on February 10.
Goode was selected as the party&#x27;s 2012 presidential nominee on April 21, 2012, at the 2012 Constitution Party National Convention in Nashville, Tennessee.

On October 23, 2012, Virgil Goode, along with Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Rocky Anderson participated in a debate moderated by Larry King. Goode lost in a poll conducted after the debate to decide who would face off in a runoff debate.

<text>The Narmer Palette, also known as the Great Hierakonpolis Palette or the Palette of Narmer, is a significant Egyptian archaeological find, dating from about the 31st century BC, belonging, at least nominally, to the category of cosmetic palettes. It contains some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found. The tablet is thought by some to depict the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the king Narmer. Along with the Scorpion Macehead and the Narmer Maceheads, also found together in the main deposit at Nekhen, the Narmer Palette provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. On one side, the king is depicted with the bulbed White Crown of Upper (southern) Egypt, and the other side depicts the king wearing the level Red Crown of Lower (northern) Egypt, which also makes it the earliest known example of a king wearing both types of headdress. The Palette shows many of the classic conventions of Ancient Egyptian art, which must already have been formalized by the time of the Palette&#x27;s creation. Egyptologists Bob Brier and A. Hoyt Hobbs have referred to the Narmer Palette as &quot;The oldest Egyptian historical record&quot;.

The Palette, which has survived five millennia in almost perfect condition, was discovered by British archeologists James Quibell and Frederick W. Green, in what they called the Main Deposit in the Temple of Horus at Nekhen, during the dig season of 1897–98. Also found at this dig were the Narmer Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead. The exact place and circumstances of these finds were not recorded very clearly by Quibell and Green. In fact, Green&#x27;s report placed the Palette in a different layer one or two yards away from the deposit, which is considered to be more accurate on the basis of the original excavation notes. It has been suggested that these objects were royal donations made to the temple. Nekhen, or Hierakonpolis, was one of four power centers in Upper Egypt that preceded the consolidation of Upper Egypt at the end of the Naqada III period. Hierakonpolis&#x27;s religious importance continued long after its political role had declined. Palettes were typically used for grinding cosmetics, but this palette is too large and heavy (and elaborate) to have been created for personal use and was probably a ritual or votive object, specifically made for donation to, or use in, a temple. One theory is that it was used to grind cosmetics to adorn the statues of the deities.

The Narmer Palette is part of the permanent collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It is one of the initial exhibits which visitors have been able to see when entering the museum. Its inventory number is JE 32169 and its former identification number is CG 14716.

==Description==

The Narmer Palette is a by , shield-shaped, ceremonial palette, carved from a single piece of flat, soft dark gray-green greywacke. The stone has often been wrongly identified, in the past, as being slate or schist. Slate is layered and prone to flaking, and schist is a metamorphic rock containing large, randomly distributed mineral grains. Both are unlike the finely grained, hard, flake-resistant siltstone, whose source is from a well-attested quarry that has been used since pre-dynastic times at Wadi Hammamat. This material was used extensively during the pre-dynastic period for creating such palettes and also was used as a source for Old Kingdom statuary. A statue of the 2nd dynasty pharaoh Khasekhemwy, found in the same complex as the Narmer Palette at Hierakonpolis, also was made of this material.
The Palette is carved in low relief. At the top of both sides is an identical royal insignia called a serekh, which is &quot;a composite hieroglyphic symbol standing for the king/crown/state and the state&#x27;s property&quot;. The serekhs bear the rebus symbols &quot;n&#x27;r&quot; (catfish) and &quot;mr&quot; (chisel) inside, being the phonetic representation of Narmer&#x27;s name. Both serekhs are flanked by a pair of bovine heads with highly curved horns, thought to represent the cow goddess Bat. She was the patron deity of the seventh nome of Upper Egypt, and was also the deification of the cosmos within Egyptian mythology during the pre-dynastic and Old Kingdom periods of Ancient Egyptian history.
===Recto side===
Depicted at the top of either side, two human-faced bovine heads, thought to represent the patron cow goddess Bat, flank the serekh of Narmer. The goddess Bat is, as she often was, shown in portrait, rather than in profile as is traditional in Egyptian relief carving. Hathor, who shared many of Bat&#x27;s characteristics, is often depicted in a similar manner. Some authors suggest that the images represent the vigor of the king as a pair of bulls.

The largest relief on this side depicts Narmer, who lifts a royal mace in his right hand while with his left he pulls up a kneeling captive by the hair. In contrast to the verso depiction of Narmer, where he is shown with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, on this side he wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt. His pose reflects the Ancient Egyptian convention of showing an important figure from multiple perspectives at once. His feet, legs and head are shown in profile, while the torso and hips turn slightly and his shoulders face the front. One eye, even though it would normally not be seen if this were an actual profile head, is also shown from the front. The purpose was to provide the most complete information possible about a person on a flat surface. The Palette also shows the Egyptian canon of body proportions. Based on an established unit correlating to the distance across the knuckles of human fist, this conventional form of measurement was a means of standardizing the proportions of important figures in Egyptian art. The standard measurement of 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead is apparent in the Palette. Both artistic conventions remained in use until at least the conquest by Alexander the Great over 3,000 years later. The minor figures in active poses, such as the king&#x27;s captive, the corpses and the handlers of the serpopard beasts, are much more freely depicted.
Attached to the belt worn by Narmer are four beaded tassels, each capped with an ornament in the shape of the head of the goddess Hathor. They also are the same heads as those that adorn the top of each side of the palette. At the back of the belt is attached a long fringe representing a lion&#x27;s tail.

On the left of the king is a man bearing the king&#x27;s sandals, flanked by a rosette symbol. To the right of the king is a kneeling prisoner, who is about to be struck by the king. A pair of symbols appear next to his head perhaps indicating his name (Wash) or indicating the region where he was from. Above the prisoner is a falcon, representing Horus, perched above a set of papyrus flowers, the symbol of Lower Egypt. In his talons, he holds a rope-like object which appears to be attached to the nose of a man&#x27;s head that also emerges from the papyrus flowers.

===Verso side===
Below the bovine heads is what appears to be a procession. Narmer is significantly larger than anyone else on that register, an artistic convention known variously as hierarchical proportion, hierarchic scale or hierarchy of scale. As on the recto, his disproportionate size reinforces the ideas of conquest and political power as a god-like leader. He wears a Red Crown of Lower Egypt, symbolized by a papyrus. He holds a mace and a flail, two traditional symbols of kingship. To his right are the hieroglyphic symbols for his name, though not contained within a serekh. Behind him is his sandal-bearer, whose name may be represented by the rosette appearing adjacent to his head, and a second rectangular symbol that has no clear interpretation, but which has been suggested may represent a town or citadel.

Immediately in front of the pharaoh is a long-haired man, accompanied by a pair of hieroglyphs that have been interpreted as his name: &quot;Tshet&quot; (this assumes that these symbols had the same phonetic value used in later hieroglyphic writing). Before this man are four standard bearers, holding aloft an animal skin, a dog, and two falcons. At the far right of this scene are ten decapitated corpses with their heads placed between their legs and their severed genitals placed atop each head. These figures are generally understood to be victims of Narmer&#x27;s conquest. Above them are symbols for a ship, a falcon holding a harpoon and a door.
Below the procession, two men are holding ropes tied to the outstretched, intertwining necks of two serpopards confronting each other. The serpopard is a mythological creature, a mix of serpent and leopard. The circle formed by their curving necks is the central part of the Palette, which is the area where the cosmetics would have been ground. Upper and Lower Egypt each worshipped lioness war goddesses as protectors; the intertwined necks of the serpopards may thus represent the unification of the state. Similar images of such mythical animals are known from other contemporaneous cultures, and there are other examples of late-predynastic objects (including other palettes and knife handles such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife) which borrow similar elements from Mesopotamian iconography, suggesting Egypt-Mesopotamia relations.

At the bottom of the verso, a bull is seen knocking down the walls of a city while trampling on a fallen foe. Head lowered, Narmer is shown here as a stylized, two-dimensional beast who will vanquish his enemies. Bulls had an ideological connection to Egyptian kingship. &quot;Bull of his Mother&quot;, for example, was a common epithet given to an Egyptian king as the son of the patron cow goddess. This posture of a bovine has the meaning of &quot;force&quot; in later hieroglyphics.

==Scholarly debate==
The Palette has raised considerable scholarly debate over the years. In general, the arguments fall into one of two camps: scholars who believe that the Palette is a record of an important event, and other academics who argue that it is an object designed to establish the mythology of united rule over Upper and Lower Egypt by the king.
It had been thought that the Palette either depicted the unification of Lower Egypt by the king of Upper Egypt, or recorded a recent military success over the Libyans, or the last stronghold of a Lower Egyptian dynasty based in Buto. More recently, scholars such as Nicholas Millet have argued that the Palette does not represent a historical event (such as the unification of Egypt), but instead represents the events of the year in which the object was dedicated to the temple. Whitney Davis has suggested that the iconography on this and other pre-dynastic palettes has more to do with establishing the king as a visual metaphor of the conquering hunter, caught in the moment of delivering a mortal blow to his enemies. John Baines has suggested that the events portrayed are &quot;tokens of royal achievement&quot; from the past and that &quot;the chief purpose of the piece is not to record an event but to assert that the king dominates the ordered world in the name of the gods and has defeated internal, and especially external, forces of disorder&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The Narmer Palette is featured in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot; as one of the Egyptian objects that are present in Ozymandias&#x27;s office. The Australian author Jackie French used the Palette, and recent research into Sumerian trade routes, to create her historical novel &quot;Pharaoh&quot; (2007). The Palette is featured in manga artist Yukinobu Hoshino&#x27;s short story &quot;The temple of El Alamein&quot;. The Palette is also featured in &quot;The Kane Chronicles&quot; by Rick Riordan where the palette is fetched by a magical shawabti servant. In Ubisoft&#x27;s 2017 game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;, the Palette is mentioned as a trivia bit in loading screen tips.
The Narmer Palette is a main plot point in Lincoln Child’s &quot;The Third Gate&quot; novel, in which they attempt to find the tomb of king Narmer in the Sudd.

<text>Robert Williams Wood (May 2, 1868 – August 11, 1955) was an American physicist and inventor who made pivotal contributions to the field of optics. He pioneered infrared and ultraviolet photography. Wood&#x27;s patents and theoretical work inform modern understanding of the physics of ultraviolet light, and made possible myriad uses of UV fluorescence which became popular after World War I. He published many articles on spectroscopy, phosphorescence, diffraction, and ultraviolet light.

== Early life and education ==
Robert W. Wood was born in Concord, Massachusetts to Robert Williams Wood, Senior. His father had been born in Massachusetts in 1803 and worked as a physician in Maine until 1838, then as a physician and pioneer in the sugar industry on the Hawaiian Islands until 1866. He was also active in the American Statistical Association. 
Wood junior attended The Roxbury Latin School initially intending to become a priest. However, he decided to study optics instead when he witnessed a rare glowing aurora one night and believed the effect to be caused by &quot;invisible rays&quot;. In his pursuit to find these &quot;invisible rays&quot;, Wood studied and earned several degrees in physics from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

As a student at Harvard he swallowed marijuana as part of a self experiment, recorded the hallucinations he experienced in a report for a course of psychology. A New York newspaper published the report. After he had received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry there, he continued at Johns Hopkins University and in 1892 he changed to the University of Chicago. In 1894 he went to the Berlin University to continue chemistry, and under Heinrich Rubens’s influence changed permanently to a career in physics. In 1896, he returned to the US, first the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
in 1897 as an instructor at the University of Wisconsin.

== Career ==

After 4 years at the University of Wisconsin and after Henry Augustus Rowland&#x27;s death, he was only 33 years old and yet appointed as his successor at Johns Hopkins University and full-time professor of &quot;optical physics&quot; at Johns Hopkins University from 1901 until his death. He worked closely with Alfred Lee Loomis at Tuxedo Park, New York.

In early 1900 he visited the United Kingdom giving a lecture at the Society of Arts in London on the diffraction process of photography in colours.

Early in 1902, Wood found that the reflection spectra of subwavelength metallic grating had dark areas. This unusual phenomenon was named Wood&#x27;s anomaly and led to the discovery of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP), a particular electromagnetic wave excited at metal surfaces.

In 1903 he developed a filter, Wood&#x27;s glass, that was opaque to visible light but transparent to both ultraviolet and infrared, and is used in modern-day black lights. He used it for ultraviolet photography but also suggested its use for secret communication. He was also the first person to photograph ultraviolet fluorescence. He also developed an ultraviolet lamp, which is widely known as the Wood&#x27;s lamp in medicine. The slightly surreal glowing appearance of foliage in infrared photographs is called the Wood effect.

In 1904, Wood disproved the existence of so-called N-rays. The French physicist Prosper-René Blondlot claimed to have discovered a new form of radiation similar to X-rays, which he named N-rays. Some physicists reported having successfully reproduced his experiments; others reported that they had failed to observe the phenomenon. Visiting Blondlot&#x27;s laboratory at the behest of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, Wood surreptitiously removed an essential prism from Blondlot&#x27;s apparatus during a demonstration. The alleged effect was still reported, showing that N-rays had been self-deception on Blondlot&#x27;s part.

Wood identified an area of very low ultraviolet albedo (an area where most of the ultraviolet was absorbed) in the Aristarchus plateau region of the Moon, which he suggested was due to high sulfur content. The area continues to be called Wood&#x27;s Spot.

In 1909, Wood constructed the first practical liquid mirror astronomical telescope, by spinning mercury to form a paraboloidal shape, and investigated its benefits and limitations. Wood has been described as the &quot;father of both infrared and ultraviolet photography&quot;. Though the discovery of electromagnetic radiation beyond the visible spectrum and the development of photographic emulsions capable of recording them predate Wood, he was the first to intentionally produce photographs with both infrared and ultraviolet radiation. In 1938, he officially retired and was then appointed Research Professor, a position he kept until his death.

Both before and after his retirement Wood took part in several police investigations, including the Wall Street bombing. His investigations into the &quot;Candy-Box Murder&quot;, a 1930 bombing that killed 18-year Naomi Hall Brady and two of her siblings at her home in Seat Pleasant, Maryland, helped convict her brother-in-law Leroy of manslaughter. The bizarre death of 51-year-old socialite Katherine Briscoe at her Baltimore home in 1934 from a carelessly discarded blasting cap and his experiments derived therefrom would lead to the first scientific publication on explosively formed penetrators in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1936.

Wood also authored nontechnical works. In 1915, Wood co-wrote a science fiction novel, &quot;The Man Who Rocked the Earth&quot;, along with Arthur Train. Its sequel, &quot;The Moon Maker&quot;, was published the next year. Wood also wrote and illustrated two books of children&#x27;s verse, &quot;How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers&quot; (1907), and &quot;Animal Analogues&quot; (1908).

== Personal life ==
In 1892, Wood married Gertrude Hooper Ames in San Francisco. She was the daughter of Pelham Warren and Augusta Hooper (Wood) Ames, and the granddaughter of William Northey Hooper and the Massachusetts Supreme Court justice Seth Ames. She was his &quot;constant companion for more than 60 years, although she herself had no interest in scientific things&quot; , in Baltimore, at their summer place near Easthampton on Long Island, and during their travels abroad. They had a very wide circle of friends. His wife provided &quot;stability without which a man of Wood’s temperament might have found life occasionally very difficult&quot;. They had three children.

Wood had a heart attack a few years before he died during his sleep without any severe illness in Amityville, New York.

==Contributions to ultrasound==
Although physical optics and spectroscopy were Wood&#x27;s main areas of study, he made substantial contributions to the field of ultrasound as well. His main contributions were photographing sound waves and investigating high-power ultrasonics.

===Photography of sound waves===
His first contribution to the field of ultrasonics was the photography of sound waves. Wood&#x27;s primary research area was physical optics, but he found himself confronted with the problem of demonstrating to his students the wave nature of light without resorting to mathematical abstractions which they found confusing. He therefore resolved to photograph the sound waves given off by an electric spark as an analogy to light waves. An electric spark was used because it produces not a wave train, but a single wavefront, making it much more intuitive to study and visualize. Although this method was first discovered by August Toepler, Wood did more-detailed studies of the shock waves and their reflections.

===High-powered ultrasound===
After these early contributions Wood returned to physical optics, setting aside his interest in &quot;supersonics&quot; for quite some time. With the entry of the United States into World War I, Wood was asked to help with the war effort. He decided to work with Paul Langevin, who was investigating ultrasound as a method for detecting submarines. While in Langevin&#x27;s lab, he observed that high-powered ultrasonic waves can cause the formation of air bubbles in water, and that fish would be killed or an experimenter&#x27;s hand would suffer searing pain if placed in the path of an intense sound beam. All of these observations piqued his interest in high-powered ultrasound.

In 1926, Wood recounted Langevin&#x27;s experiments to Alfred Lee Loomis, and the two of them collaborated on high intensity ultrasound experiments; this turned out to be Wood&#x27;s primary contribution to the field of ultrasonics.

The experimental setup was driven by a two kW oscillator that had been designed for a furnace, allowing for the generation of very high output power. The frequencies they used ran from 100 to 700 kHz. When the quartz plate transducer was suspended in oil, it would raise a mound of oil up to higher than the rest of the surface of the oil. At lower powers, the mound was low and lumpy; at high powers, it would rise up to the full 7 cm, &quot;its summit erupting oil drops like a miniature volcano&quot;. The airborne oil drops could reach heights of . Similarly, when an diameter glass plate was placed on the surface of the oil, up to of external weight could be placed on top of the glass plate, supported by the strength of the ultrasound waves alone. This was achieved by the waves reflecting and re-reflecting between the transducer and the glass plate, allowing each generated wave to impart its force to the glass plate multiple times.

When attempting to take the temperature of the mound of erupting oil with a glass thermometer, Wood and Loomis accidentally discovered another set of effects. They noted that although the mercury in the thermometer only indicated , the glass felt so hot that it was painful to touch, and they noticed that the pain became unbearable if they tried to squeeze the thermometer tightly. Even if very fine thread of glass only in diameter and long was put in the oil at one end, holding a bulge in the glass at the other end still resulted in a groove being left in the skin and the skin being seared, with painful and bloody blisters forming that lasted several weeks, showing that the transmitted ultrasound vibrations generated were quite powerful. When a vibrating glass rod was placed lightly in contact with dried woodchips, the rod would burn the wood and cause it to smoke; when pressed against a woodchip it would quickly burn through the chip, leaving behind a charred hole. All the while the glass rod remained cool, with the heating confined to the tip. When a glass rod was pressed lightly against a glass plate it etched the surface, while if pressed harder it bored right through the plate. Microscopic examinations showed that the debris given off included finely powdered glass and globules of molten glass.

Wood and Loomis also investigated heating liquids and solids internally using high intensity ultrasound. While the heating of liquids was relatively straightforward, they were also able to heat an ice cube such that the center melted before the outside. The ability to heat or damage objects internally is now the basis of modern therapeutic ultrasound. Turning their attention to the effects of high-intensity ultrasound on living matter, Wood and Loomis observed ultrasound tearing fragile bodies to pieces. Cells were generally torn apart at sufficiently high exposure, although very small ones like bacteria managed to avoid destruction. Frogs, mice, or small fish were killed after one to two minutes of exposure, replicating Langevin&#x27;s earlier observation.

Wood and Loomis also investigated the formation of emulsions and fogs, crystallization and nucleation, chemical reactions, interference patterns, and standing waves in solids and liquids under high-intensity ultrasound. After completing this broad array of experiments, Wood returned to optics and did not return to ultrasonic work. Loomis would go on to advance the science further with other collaborators.

<text>Mathew B. Brady ( – January 15, 1896) was an American photographer. Known as one of the earliest and most famous photographers in American history, he is best known for his scenes of the Civil War. He studied under inventor Samuel Morse, who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in America. Brady opened his own studio in New York City in 1844, and went on to photograph U.S. presidents John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Millard Fillmore, Martin Van Buren, and other public figures.

When the Civil War began, Brady&#x27;s use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled thousands of vivid battlefield photographs to bring home the reality of war to the public. He also photographed generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict, though most of these were taken by his assistants rather than by Brady himself.

After the end of the Civil War, these pictures went out of fashion, and the government did not purchase the master copies as he had anticipated. Brady&#x27;s fortunes declined sharply, and he died in debt.

==Early life==

Brady left little record of his life before photography. Speaking to the press in the last years of his life, he stated that he was born between 1822 and 1824 in Warren County, New York, near Lake George. He was the youngest of three children to Irish immigrant parents, Andrew and Samantha Julia Brady. In official documents before and during the American Civil War, however, he claimed to have been born in Ireland.

==Career==
At the age of 16, Brady moved to Saratoga, New York, where he met portrait painter William Page and became Page&#x27;s student. In 1839, the two traveled to Albany, and then to New York City, where Brady continued to study painting with Page and with Samuel Morse, Page&#x27;s former teacher. Morse had met Louis Jacques Daguerre in France in 1839, and returned to the US to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images. At first, Brady&#x27;s involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes. But soon he became the center of the New York artistic colony that wished to study photography. Morse opened a studio and offered classes; Brady was one of the first students.

In 1844, Brady opened his own photography studio at the corner of Broadway and Fulton Street in New York, and by 1845, he began to exhibit his portraits of famous Americans, including the likes of Senator Daniel Webster and writer Edgar Allan Poe. In 1849, he opened a studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., where he met Juliet (whom everybody called &#x27;Julia&#x27;) Handy, whom he married in 1850 and lived with on Staten Island. Brady&#x27;s early images were daguerreotypes, and he won many awards for his work; in the 1850s, ambrotype photography became popular, which gave way to the albumen print, a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the Civil War photography.

In 1850, Brady produced &quot;The Gallery of Illustrious Americans&quot;, a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures. The album, which featured noteworthy images including the elderly Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to Brady&#x27;s work and artistry. In 1854, Parisian photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri popularized the &quot;carte de visite&quot;, and these small pictures (the size of a visiting card) rapidly became a popular novelty; thousands were created and sold in the United States and Europe.

In 1856, Brady placed an ad in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; offering to produce &quot;photographs, ambrotypes and daguerreotypes.&quot; This inventive ad pioneered, in the US, the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements.

===Civil War documentation===
At first, the effect of the Civil War on Brady&#x27;s business was a brisk increase in sales of &quot;cartes de visite&quot; to departing soldiers. Brady marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers&#x27; images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; that warned, &quot;You cannot tell how soon it may be too late.&quot; However, he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself. He first applied to an old friend, General Winfield Scott, for permission to have his photographers travel to the battle sites, and eventually he made his application to President Lincoln himself. Lincoln granted permission in 1861, with the provision that Brady finance the project himself.

His efforts to document the Civil War on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned Brady his place in history. Despite the dangers, financial risk, and discouragement by his friends, Brady was later quoted as saying, &quot;I had to go. A spirit in my feet said &#x27;Go,&#x27; and I went.&quot; His first popular photographs of the conflict were at the First Battle of Bull Run, in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture. While most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken, Brady came under direct fire at Bull Run, Petersburg, and Fredericksburg.

He employed Alexander Gardner, James Gardner, Timothy H. O&#x27;Sullivan, William Pywell, George N. Barnard, Thomas C. Roche, and seventeen other men, each of whom was given a traveling darkroom, to go out and photograph scenes from the Civil War. Brady generally resided in Washington, D.C., where he organized his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally. However, as author Roy Meredith points out, &quot;He [Brady] was essentially the director. The actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important, but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important, if not more so than just &#x27;snapping the shutter.

This may have been due, at least in part, to the fact that Brady&#x27;s eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the 1850s. Many of the images in Brady&#x27;s collection are, in reality, thought to be the work of his assistants. Brady was criticized for failing to document the photographer, though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image. Because so much of Brady&#x27;s photography is missing information, it is difficult to know not only who took the picture, but also exactly when or where it was taken.

In October 1862, Brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the Battle of Antietam in his New York City gallery, titled &quot;The Dead of Antietam&quot;. Many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses, a presentation new to America. This was the first time that many Americans saw the realities of war in photographs, as distinct from previous artists&#x27; impressions.

Through his many paid assistants, Brady took thousands of photos of Civil War scenes. Much of the popular understanding of the war comes from these photos. There are thousands of photos in the National Archives and the Library of Congress taken by Brady and his associates, Alexander Gardner, George Barnard and Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan. The photographs include Lincoln, General Ulysses S. Grant, and soldiers in camps and battlefields. The images provide a pictorial cross reference of Civil War history. Brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes, as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still for a clear photo to be produced.

Following the conflict, a war-weary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war, and Brady&#x27;s popularity and practice declined drastically.

===Financial struggles and death===

During the war, Brady spent over $100,000 (about $1,878,001 in 2022) to create over 10,000 plates. He expected the U.S. government to buy the photographs when the Civil War ended. Despite a recommendation from Congress&#x27; Joint Committee on the Library, the government declined to do so and Brady was forced to sell his New York City studio and file for bankruptcy. Congress granted Brady $25,000 in 1875, but he remained deeply in debt. Unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the Civil War after it ended, private collectors for Brady&#x27;s works were scarce.

Depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight, and devastated by the death of his wife in 1887, Brady died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 15, 1896, from complications from a street-car accident. Brady&#x27;s funeral was financed by veterans of the 7th New York Infantry, and he was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Legacy==
Brady photographed 18 of the 19 American presidents from John Quincy Adams to William McKinley. The exception was the ninth president, William Henry Harrison, who died in office three years before Brady started his photographic collection. Brady photographed Abraham Lincoln on many occasions. His Lincoln photographs have been used for the $5 bill and the Lincoln penny. One of his Lincoln photos was used by the National Bank Note Company as a model for the engraving on the 90-cent Lincoln Postage issue of 1869.

The thousands of photographs which Mathew Brady&#x27;s photographers (such as Alexander Gardner and Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan) took have become the most important visual documentation of the Civil War, and have helped historians and the public better understand the era.

Brady photographed and made portraits of many senior Union officers in the war, including:

* Ulysses S. Grant
* Nathaniel Banks
* Don Carlos Buell
* Ambrose Burnside
* Benjamin Butler
* Joshua Chamberlain
* George Custer
* David Farragut
* John Gibbon
* Winfield Hancock
* Samuel P. Heintzelman
* Joseph Hooker
* Oliver Otis Howard
* David Hunter
* John A. Logan
* Irvin McDowell
* George McClellan
* Freeman McGilvery
* James McPherson
* George Meade
* Montgomery C. Meigs
* David Dixon Porter
* William Rosecrans
* John Schofield
* William Sherman
* Daniel Sickles
* Henry Warner Slocum
* George Stoneman
* Edwin V. Sumner
* George Thomas
* Emory Upton
* James Wadsworth
* Lew Wallace
Brady also photographed people on the Confederate side, including:
* Jefferson Davis
* P. G. T. Beauregard
* Stonewall Jackson
* Albert Pike
* James Longstreet
* James Henry Hammond
* Henry Hopkins Sibley
* Robert E. Lee
Brady also photographed Lord Lyons, the British ambassador to Washington during the Civil War.

===Photojournalism and honors===
Brady is credited with being the father of photojournalism. He can also be considered a pioneer in the orchestration of a &quot;corporate credit line&quot;. In this practice, every image produced in his gallery was labeled &quot;Photo by Brady&quot;; however, Brady dealt directly with only the most distinguished subjects, and most portrait sessions were carried out by others.

As perhaps the best-known US photographer in the 19th century, it was Brady&#x27;s name that came to be attached to the era&#x27;s heavy specialized end tables which were factory-made specifically for use by portrait photographers. Such a &quot;Brady stand&quot; of the mid-19th century typically had a weighty cast iron base for stability, plus an adjustable-height single-column pipe leg for dual use as either a portrait model&#x27;s armrest or (when fully extended and fitted with a brace attachment rather than the usual tabletop) as a neck rest. The latter was often needed to keep models steady during the longer exposure times of early photography. While &quot;Brady stand&quot; is a convenient term for these trade-specific articles of studio equipment, there is no proven connection between Brady himself and the Brady stand&#x27;s invention .

In 2013, Brady Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was officially renamed Mathew Brady Street. The original namesake Brady was W. Tate Brady, a prominent businessman in Tulsa&#x27;s early history, who had connections to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations. Following considerable controversy, the City Council of Tulsa voted on August 15, 2013, to retain the name Brady for the street, but that it would now refer to and honor Mathew B. Brady instead. Mathew Brady never visited Tulsa in his lifetime.

In 1968 Brady became one of the first two Americans named to the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

===Books and documentaries===
Brady and his studio produced over 7,000 pictures (mostly two negatives of each). One set, &quot;after undergoing extraordinary vicissitudes,&quot; came into U.S. government possession. His own negatives passed in the 1870s to E. &amp; H. T. Anthony &amp; Company of New York, in default of payment for photographic supplies. They &quot;were kicked about from pillar to post&quot; for 10 years, until John C. Taylor found them in an attic and bought them; from this they became &quot;the backbone of the Ordway–Rand collection; and in 1895 Brady himself had no idea of what had become of them. Many were broken, lost, or destroyed by fire. After passing to various other owners, they were discovered and appreciated by Edward Bailey Eaton,&quot; who set in motion &quot;events that led to their importance as the nucleus of a collection of Civil War photos published in 1912 as &quot;The Photographic History of the Civil War.&quot;

Some of the lost images are mentioned in the last episode of Ken Burns&#x27; 1990 documentary series &quot;The Civil War&quot;. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself to be used in greenhouses and cold frames. In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.

The idea that many of the Civil war negatives perished by being used in greenhouses is probably a myth. This is also dispelled by the Civil War photo historian Bob Zeller. Practically all histories of Civil War photography omit the fact that most were taken in 3-D and many were published as side-by-side 3-D images. Zeller&#x27;s book &quot;The Civil War in Depth&quot; reproduces many of these images the way they are supposed to be seen, instead of just half shown in 2-D. Indeed, the picture of Brady in a straw hat shown in this article is reproduced as a stereoscopic side-by-side image on page 12 of &quot;The Civil War in Depth&quot;. Mathew Brady&#x27;s photographers created many of the Civil War images, most of which were in 3-D according to Zeller.

===Exhibitions===
On September 19, 1862, two days after the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of combat on U.S. soil with more than 23,000 killed, wounded or missing, Brady sent photographer Alexander Gardner and his assistant James Gibson to photograph the carnage. In October 1862, Brady displayed the photos by Gardner at his New York gallery under the title &quot;The Dead of Antietam&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a review.

In October 2012, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine displayed 21 original Mathew Brady photographs from 1862 documenting the Battle of Antietam.

<text>The Group of Eight (Go8 or G8) comprises Australia&#x27;s most research intensive universities (in alphabetical order) – the Australian National University, Monash University, University of Adelaide, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, University of Queensland, University of Sydney, and University of Western Australia. It is often compared to the Russell Group of research universities in the United Kingdom.

== Overview ==
The Go8 universities are some of the largest and the oldest universities in Australia and are consistently the highest ranked of all Australian universities. Seven of the Go8 members are ranked in the world&#x27;s top 100 universities and all Go8 members are ranked in the world&#x27;s top 150 universities; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings and the U.S. News &amp; World Report. Go8 Universities feature in the top 50 for every broad subject area in the QS world university subject rankings. In addition, all Go8 Universities are in the QS top 100 for Engineering and Technology, Life Sciences and Medicine, Arts and Humanities, and Social Sciences and Management.

The Go8 educates 425,000 students; educating more than one quarter of all higher education students in Australia. It graduates some 110,000 graduates each year.

The Go8 undertakes 70 per cent of Australia&#x27;s university research and their research funding from industry and other non-Government sources is twice that of the rest of the sector combined.

The Go8 receives 71 per cent of Australian Competitive Grant (Category 1) funding and had the largest proportion of research fields rated at 4 or 5 (&#x27;above&#x27; or &#x27;well above&#x27; world standard) in the latest Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) exercise, with 99 per cent of Go8 research is world class or above. Each year the Go8 spends some $6.5 billion on research – more than $2.4 billion of which is spent on Medical and Health Services research. Go8 universities educate more than half of Australia&#x27;s doctors, dentists, vets and provide some 54 per cent of Australia&#x27;s science graduates and more than 40 per cent of Australia&#x27;s engineering graduates.

The Go8 Board, which consists of the vice-chancellors (who also serve as principals or presidents) of its eight member universities, meets five times a year. The current Chair of the Board is Professor Brian Schmidt, Vice-Chancellor and President of The Australian National University, appointed in 2023. Vicki Thomson is the Chief Executive of the Group of Eight, taking up the role in January 2015.

<doc id="440866" wikidata="Q471851" url="?curid=440866" title="James Murdoch">
<text>James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (born 13 December 1972) is an American businessman. He is the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the former chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox from 2015 to 2019.

He was the chairman and CEO for Europe and Asia of News Corporation until 2013 when it was split into News Corp and 21st Century Fox. He was formerly a director of News Corp and was a member of the office of the chairman.

Until April 2012, he was the chairman and CEO of Sky plc, Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (publisher of &quot;The News of the World&quot; newspaper), Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV.

Murdoch was executive chairman of News International from 2007. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation had a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone hacking scandal, in which he was implicated and severely criticised in a parliamentary report. He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.

In July 2020, he resigned from the board of News Corp due to disagreements with its editorial content and strategic direction.

In 2021, Murdoch set up the Indian arm of his family office, Lupa Systems India, as a joint venture with businessman Uday Shankar. 

, the whole Murdoch family is involved in a court case in the US in which James, his sister Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence are challenging their father&#x27;s bid to amend the family trust to ensure that his eldest son, Lachlan, retains control of News Corp and Fox Corp, rather than benefiting all of his six children, as is specified in the &quot;irrevocable&quot; terms of the trust.

==Early life and education ==
James Rupert Jacob Murdoch was born on 13 December 1972 at Wimbledon Hospital in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth child of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann (née Torv), the others being Elisabeth and Lachlan. 

As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel. He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; but made headlines in the rival &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.

Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he was a member of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies. With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.

==Business career==
In 1996, Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation&#x27;s internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results. He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine &quot;Gear&quot;.

He is credited with sparking his father&#x27;s interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company PointCast for US$450 million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.

After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). It was at first thought that News Corporation might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but FMR struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly. FMR was closed in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold: the recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.

In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation&#x27;s ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100 million a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.

In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owned a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK&#x27;s top companies He was an executive vice-president of News Corporation (the controlling shareholder of BSkyB) and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.

Following the surprise resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation in July 2005, James was viewed as his father&#x27;s heir-apparent.
In December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).

In a related announcement, Murdoch also took &quot;direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation&#x27;s television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.&quot; This included holdings such as News International, Sky Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corporation related assets. He was based at News International&#x27;s headquarters in Wapping, East London.

In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.

In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC&#x27;s expansion &quot;chilling&quot; and also said: &quot;In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy.&quot; The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, &quot;We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC&#x27;s public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK.&quot;

In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks entered the offices of &quot;The Independent&quot; to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper. 

Until April 2012, he was the chairman and CEO of Sky plc, Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (publisher of &quot;The News of the World&quot; newspaper), Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV. 

He was executive chairman of News International from 2007 until February 2012. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation had a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.

In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.

In June 2015, his father, Rupert, announced that he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James would take over the position.

In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain&#x27;s subscription broadcaster.

In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla.

In October 2018, Murdoch left Sky after Comcast took the majority control of the company.

In March 2019, 21st Century Fox was sold to The Walt Disney Company, ending Murdoch&#x27;s tenure as CEO. 

Murdoch was a director of News Corp in August 2019. In July 2020, he resigned from the board. His resignation letter stated that his resignation was &quot;due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company&#x27;s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions&quot;. He criticised the &quot;ongoing denial of the role of climate change&quot; seen in the Australian outlets, following the particularly devastating 2019–20 Australian bushfire season. 

In 2021, Murdoch set up the Indian arm of his family office, Lupa Systems India, as a joint venture with businessman Uday Shankar. The aim of the joint venture was to focus on media, education, and the healthcare sectors in Asia, particularly India. In May 2022, Lupa India (renamed to Bodhi Tree Systems) announced a $600 million investment in the test-prep company Allen Career Institute Private Limited for a 36% stake, and completed the deal in July. In April 2023, Bodhi Tree acquired a 13% stake in the Reliance-owned media and entertainment company, Viacom18, and subsequently increased it to 16% by August 2023. In February 2024, Viacom18 and Disney-Star India entered into a joint venture to form an $8.5 billion entity.

==2011 phone hacking scandal and aftermath ==
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the &quot;News of the World&quot; in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.

On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one &quot;rogue reporter&quot; from the &quot;News of the World&quot; tabloid had been involved in phone hacking. This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the &quot;Transcript for Neville&quot; email, a potential &quot;smoking gun&quot; indicating several of the newspaper&#x27;s journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public. On 22 July 2011, Britain&#x27;s prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch had &quot;questions to answer in Parliament,&quot; a day after former top executives of the &quot;News of the World&quot; accused the News Corporation executive of giving &quot;mistaken&quot; evidence. 

In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;News of the World&quot; and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch&#x27;s resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;.

In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company&#x27;s international TV business, including continued responsibility for BSkyB. He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board. In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board. He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson. In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch &quot;showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking&quot; and found him &quot;guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity&quot; over the issue. It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father &quot;should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility&quot; for wrongdoing at the &quot;News of the World&quot; and News International. In September 2012, Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he &quot;repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman&quot; and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was &quot;difficult to comprehend and ill-judged&quot;.

==Family court case (2024)==

In September 2024, the whole Murdoch family is involved in a court case in Reno, Nevada, in which James, his sister Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence MacLeod are challenging their father&#x27;s bid to amend the family trust to ensure that his eldest son, Lachlan, retains control of News Corp and Fox Corp, rather than benefiting all of his six children, as is specified in the &quot;irrevocable&quot; terms of the trust. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Murdoch Snr wants his companies to remain politically conservative, and sees his other children as too politically liberal. 

The irrevocable family trust was set up after Rupert and Anna Murdoch&#x27;s divorce in 1999, to hold the family&#x27;s 28.5% stake in News Corp. It relates only to the children born before then, giving them equal say in the fate of the business after Rupert&#x27;s death. Chloe and Grace Murdoch, Rupert&#x27;s children with third wife Wendi Deng, will have no say in the business, although will share the stock proceeds. The case follows Rupert&#x27;s attempt to change the trust in 2023, and the Nevada probate commissioner&#x27;s finding that he was allowed to amend the trust &quot;if he is able to show he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs&quot;. Rupert Murdoch is arguing interference by the other siblings would cause a financial loss to Fox, and therefore &quot;in their own best interests if they have their votes taken away from them&quot;. He argues that preserving the outlet&#x27;s conservative editorial stance against interference by the more politically moderate siblings would better protect its commercial value.

The case has led to the three children becoming estranged from their father, with none of them attending his wedding to his fifth wife, Elena Zhukova, in June 2024.

==Personal life and other activities==
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. Apart from full siblings Elisabeth and Lachlan Murdoch, he has three half-siblings, including an elder half-sister Prudence, and two younger half-sisters by his father&#x27;s third marriage to Wendi Deng, Grace and Chloe.

Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself. He maintains an early morning gym routine and has a black belt in karate. 

Murdoch married Kathryn Hufschmid in 2000, and they have three children: Anneka, Walter, and Emerson. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former U.S. president, Bill Clinton in 2006. 

Since 2014, James and Kathryn have run the Quadrivium Foundation, which supports &quot;initiatives that address the root causes of problems and where single actions can create multiple positive outcomes&quot;. It is focused on five key areas: democracy, technology and society, scientific understanding, climate change, and the health of the world&#x27;s oceans. It invests in evidence-based solutions to problems. 

Murdoch has donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organisation run by Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton.

In 2020, Murdoch and his wife each donated US$615,000 to the Biden campaign. In September 2024, he was one of 88 American corporate leaders who signed an open letter endorsing vice-president Kamala Harris for president. 

He has been highly critical of Fox News&#x27; promotion of Donald Trump&#x27;s false claims of election fraud after he lost the 2020 election. Fox was subsequently successfully sued for defamation, losing over $US787 million in costs.

<doc id="440868" wikidata="Q1125423" url="?curid=440868" title="Marine One">
<text>Marine One is the call sign of any United States Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president of the United States. As of 2024, it denotes a presidential transport helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, consisting of either the large new VH-92A Patriot and smaller VH-60N &quot;White Hawk&quot;. Both helicopters are called &quot;White Tops&quot; because of their livery. Any Marine Corps aircraft carrying the vice president of the United States without the president has the call sign Marine Two.

== History ==

The first use of a helicopter to transport the president was in 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled on a Bell UH-13J Sioux. The president wanted a quick way to reach his summer home, in Pennsylvania. Using Air Force One would have been impractical over such a short distance, and there was no airfield near his home with a paved runway to support fixed-wing aircraft, so Eisenhower instructed his staff to investigate other modes of transport and a Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse helicopter was commissioned. The early aircraft lacked the amenities of its modern successors, such as air conditioning and an aircraft lavatory for use in flight.

In 1958, the H-13 was replaced by the Sikorsky H-34, which was succeeded in 1961 by the VH-3A.
Not long after helicopters for presidential transport were introduced, presidential aides asked the Marine Corps to investigate using the White House South Lawn for landing. There was ample room, and the protocol was established. Until 1976, the Marine Corps shared the responsibility of helicopter transportation for the president with the United States Army. Army helicopters used the call sign Army One while the president was on board.
The VH-3D entered service in 1978. The VH-60N entered service in 1987 and has served alongside the VH-3D. Improvements were made to both models of helicopter after their introduction, to take advantage of technological developments and to meet new mission requirements. By about 2001, it was clear that so much extra weight had been added to the helicopters that mission capability was reduced and few new improvements could be made.

By 2009, there were 11 VH-3Ds and eight VH-60Ns in service for the president and other prominent individuals. On 16 July 2009, Marine One flew with an all-female crew for the first time. This was also the final flight of Major Jennifer Grieves, who was the first woman pilot to fly the president.

As of 2009, Marine One had never had an accident or been attacked. However, in 2006, President George W. Bush boarded Marine One with his departing press secretary, but the helicopter &quot;would not work&quot;, so the president left the White House in a car.

=== Replacement ===

The September 11 attacks led to agreement that the Marine One helicopter fleet needed significant upgrades to its communication, transportation, and security systems, but weight limitations prevented the changes.

In April 2002, the Department of Defense began the VXX program, which assigned the Navy to design new presidential helicopters by 2011. In November 2002, the White House asked the Secretary of Defense to accelerate development of the new aircraft; the Defense Department said a new helicopter would be ready by the end of 2008, and asked companies bidding on the project to begin development and production simultaneously.

===== Initial contracting effort =====
Many specifications for the new aircraft were secret. Industry publications and testimony at congressional briefings revealed it was to be long, carry 14 passengers, able to carry several thousand pounds of baggage and gear, and have a range greater than those of the VH-3D and the VH-60N. The helicopter&#x27;s defenses were to include radar jamming and deception, to ward off anti-aircraft missiles; protection of key electronics against nuclear electromagnetic pulse; and an encrypted telecommunications system and videoconferencing.

The only competitors for the contract were Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky Aircraft. Lockheed joined with AgustaWestland, a British and Italian aircraft company, to offer a version of the AgustaWestland AW101. Sikorsky proposed using its S-92. The Navy awarded the contract to Lockheed Martin in January 2005, to develop and build 28 helicopters. The helicopter was designated VH-71 Kestrel. Five of the initial, less sophisticated version of the VH-71 were due for delivery in 2010, with 23 of the upgraded version due in 2015. The goal was to retire all VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns, and the five initial VH-71s in 2015, leaving the Marine One fleet with 23 helicopters.

===== Cost overruns and cancellation =====
By March 2008, the previously estimated $6bn cost of the 28 helicopters had increased to $11bn. Government officials were surprised to discover that each VH-71 would cost $400 million, more than the cost of one Boeing VC-25 &quot;Air Force One&quot; airplane. Lockheed Martin blamed the Navy for the cost overruns, saying that more than 1,900 extra requirements were added to the project after the contract was signed. The Navy said no extra requirements were added. The company also cited the need to redesign the VH-71 to Navy standards, and an incomplete understanding by the Navy and Lockheed Martin of how much retrofitting the civilian aircraft would need.

In June 2009, the VH-71 program was canceled because of cost overruns, which had grown to more than $13bn. A Government Accountability Office report issued in March 2011 named three sources of cost overruns. First, asking for development at the same time as production led to extensive retrofitting of models that had just been built. Second, a complete review of the system&#x27;s requirements was not made until 4 months after production started, and only then was it discovered that the VH-71&#x27;s design could not meet the program&#x27;s needs. Third, the Defense Department and the White House asked for excessive combat and communications capabilities.

===== Marine Corps contract revival =====
Shortly after the program&#x27;s cancellation, the Marine Corps restarted the program. This time, instead of running development and production concurrently, the Corps created an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), which more clearly outlined the aircraft&#x27;s requirements. The Department approved the ICD in August 2009, naming it the VXX Helicopter Replacement Program. In February 2010, the Navy asked private industry for input in an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) to meet the project&#x27;s needs. Among the options the Navy suggested was purchasing a single aircraft but developing two versions. Another option was to buy two different aircraft—a &quot;civilian&quot; version, with a bathroom, executive suite, and galley, and a &quot;military&quot; version, with complete command and control capabilities. The AOA drew interest from more than two companies. These included Boeing, which told the press that either its CH-47 Chinook or its Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey could meet the requirements. Because the AOA contemplated a much longer process of design and production, the Navy said it intended to spend $500 million to keep the VH-3Ds and VH-60s flying. Boeing said it could adapt the VH-71, if the Navy and Marine Corps wished.

In July 2013, the Department of Defense waived the requirement that companies build prototypes. The Department&#x27;s analysis showed the cost of making prototypes was unlikely to generate benefits. The Department said it was proceeding with VXX development using an in-production aircraft with existing, proven systems. A draft request for proposals was released in November 2012.

===== Final contract award =====
By August 2013, all interested companies, including Northrop Grumman–AgustaWestland and Bell–Boeing, had withdrawn from the VXX bidding, except Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky had partnered with Lockheed Martin, and said it intended to use the S-92 as the base aircraft. A new deadline in 2020 was established for the 23-helicopter fleet to be in operation. In May 2014, the Navy awarded Sikorsky Aircraft a $1.2 billion contract to build 6 presidential helicopters, designated Sikorsky VH-92. A fleet of 21 helicopters was expected to be in service by 2023. A VH-92 made its inaugural flight as Marine One on the afternoon of 19 August 2024, when President Joe Biden rode from Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport to Soldier Field en route to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

== Current operations ==
Marine One is the preferred alternative to motorcades, which can be expensive and logistically difficult. The controlled environment of a helicopter is also considered to add a safety factor. The HMX-1 fleet is also used to transport senior Cabinet staff and foreign dignitaries. HMX-1 operates 35 helicopters of four different types as of 2009.

More than 800 Marines supervise the operation of the Marine One fleet, which is based in MCAF Quantico, Virginia, with an additional operating location at Naval Support Facility Anacostia in the District of Columbia, but is more often seen in action on the South Lawn of the White House or at Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility in Maryland. At Andrews, the helicopter is sometimes used to connect to Air Force One for longer journeys. Marine One is met on the ground by at least one Marine in full dress uniform (most often two, with one acting as an armed guard). According to a story told by Bruce Babbitt, President Clinton, in his final days of office, while flying over and landing in a remote area near the Grand Canyon, found a Marine waiting on the rock ready to salute him. Marine aviators flying Marine One do not wear regular flight suits during flights, but rather the Marine Blue Dress Charlie uniform.

At a presidential inauguration, the Marines offer the outgoing president a final flight from the Capitol to Joint Base Andrews.

=== Security measures ===
As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of as many as five identical helicopters. One helicopter carries the president, while the others serve as decoys. Upon take-off these helicopters shift in formation to obscure the location of the president. This has been referred to as a &quot;presidential shell game&quot;. Marine One is also equipped with standard military anti-missile countermeasures such as flares to counter heat-seeking missiles and chaff to counter radar-guided missiles, as well as AN/ALQ-144A infrared countermeasures. To add to the security of Marine One, every member of HMX-1 is required to pass a Yankee White background check before touching any of the helicopters used for presidential travel.

=== Long-distance transport ===
Marine One is transported via C-17 Globemaster or C-5 Galaxy military transport planes (as is the president&#x27;s limousine) wherever the president travels within the U.S., as well as overseas. Even if, during a foreign trip, the president does not use Marine One, at least one helicopter is on standby in a hangar of a local airport or air base to depart if need be.

<doc id="440869" wikidata="Q374096" url="?curid=440869" title="Chauvet Cave">
<text>The Chauvet-Pont-d&#x27;Arc Cave ( ) in the Ardèche department of southeastern France is a cave that contains some of the best-preserved figurative cave paintings in the world, as well as other evidence of Upper Paleolithic life. It is located near the commune of Vallon-Pont-d&#x27;Arc on a limestone cliff above the former bed of the river Ardèche, in the Gorges de l&#x27;Ardèche.

Discovered on December 18, 1994, it is considered one of the most significant prehistoric art sites and the UN&#x27;s cultural agency UNESCO granted it World Heritage status on June 22, 2014. The cave was first explored by a group of three speleologists: Eliette Brunel-Deschamps, Christian Hillaire, and Jean-Marie Chauvet (for whom the cave was named) six months after an aperture now known as &quot;Le Trou de Baba&quot; (&#x27;Baba&#x27;s Hole&#x27;) was discovered by Michel Rosa (Baba). At a later date the group returned to the cave. Another member of this group, Michel Chabaud, along with two others, travelled further into the cave and discovered the Gallery of the Lions, the End Chamber. Chauvet has his own detailed account of the discovery. In addition to the paintings and other human evidence, they also discovered fossilized remains, prints, and markings from a variety of animals, some of which are now extinct.

Further study by French archaeologist Jean Clottes has revealed much about the site. The dates have been a matter of dispute but a study published in 2012 supports placing the art in the Aurignacian period, approximately 32,000–30,000 years ago. A study published in 2016 using an additional 88 radiocarbon dates showed two periods of habitation, one 37,000 to 33,500 years ago and the second from 31,000 to 28,000 years ago, with most of the black drawings dating to the earlier period.

== Features ==
The cave is situated above the previous course of the Ardèche before the Pont d&#x27;Arc opened up. The gorges of the Ardèche region are the site of numerous caves, many of them having some geological or archaeological importance.

Based on radiocarbon dating, the cave appears to have been used by humans during two distinct periods: the Aurignacian and the Gravettian. Most of the artwork dates to the earlier, Aurignacian, era (32,000 to 30,000 years ago). The later Gravettian occupation, which occurred 27,000 to 25,000 years ago, left little but a child&#x27;s footprints, the charred remains of ancient hearths, and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves. The footprints may be the oldest human footprints that can be accurately dated. After the child&#x27;s visit to the cave, evidence suggests that due to a landslide that covered its historical entrance, the cave remained untouched until it was discovered in 1994. 

The soft, clay-like floor of the cave retains the paw prints of cave bears along with large, rounded depressions that are believed to be the &quot;nests&quot; where the bears slept. Fossilised bones are abundant and include the skulls of cave bears and the horned skull of an ibex. Paw-prints dated to 26,000 YBP are suggested as being those of a dog; however, these have been challenged as being left by a wolf.

== Paintings ==


Hundreds of animal paintings have been catalogued, depicting at least 13 different species, including some rarely or never found in other ice age paintings. Rather than depicting only the familiar herbivores that predominate in Paleolithic cave art, i.e. horses, aurochs, mammoths, etc., the walls of the Chauvet Cave feature many predatory animals, e.g., cave lions, leopards, bears, and cave hyenas. There are also paintings of rhinoceroses.

Typical of most cave art, there are no paintings of complete human figures, although there are two partial &quot;Venus&quot; figures: one within a niche or vestibule of the End Chamber, and the other on a roughly conical or dental-shaped pendant several meters away; both are composed of what appears to be a vulva attached to an incomplete pair of legs. Above the pendant Venus, and in contact with it, is a bison head, which has led some to describe the composite drawing as a Minotaur. There are a few panels of red ochre hand prints and hand stencils made by blowing pigment over hands pressed against the cave surface. Abstract markings—lines and dots—are found throughout the cave. There are also two unidentifiable images that have a vaguely butterfly or avian shape to them. This combination of subjects has led some students of prehistoric art and cultures to believe that there was a ritual, shamanic, or magical aspect to these paintings.

One drawing, later overlaid with a sketch of a deer, is reminiscent of a volcano spewing lava, similar to the regional volcanoes that were active at the time. If confirmed, this would represent the earliest known drawing of a volcanic eruption.

The artists who produced these paintings used techniques rarely found in other cave art. Many of the paintings appear to have been made only after the walls were scraped clear of debris and concretions, leaving a smoother and noticeably lighter area upon which the artists worked. Similarly, a three-dimensional quality and the suggestion of movement are achieved by incising or etching around the outlines of certain figures. The art is also exceptional for its time for including &quot;scenes&quot;, e.g., animals interacting with each other; a pair of woolly rhinoceroses, for example, are seen butting horns in an apparent contest for territory or mating rights.

== Dating ==
The cave contains some of the oldest known cave paintings, based on radiocarbon dating of &quot;black from drawings, from torch marks and from the floors&quot;, according to Jean Clottes. Clottes concludes that the &quot;dates fall into two groups, one centred around 27,000–26,000 BP and the other around 32,000–30,000 BP.&quot; As of 1999, the dates of 31 samples from the cave had been reported. The earliest, sample Gifa 99776 from &quot;zone 10&quot;, dates to 32,900 ± 490 BP.

Some archaeologists have questioned these dates. Christian Züchner, relying on stylistic comparisons with similar paintings at other well-dated sites, expressed the opinion that the red paintings are from the Gravettian period (c. 28,000–23,000 BP) and the black paintings are from the Early Magdalenian period (early part of c. 18,00010,000 BP). Pettitt and Bahn also contended that the dating is inconsistent with the traditional stylistic sequence and that there is uncertainty about the source of the charcoal used in the drawings and the extent of surface contamination on the exposed rock surfaces. Stylistic studies showed that some Gravettian engravings are superimposed on black paintings proving the paintings&#x27; older origins.

By 2011, more than 80 radiocarbon dates had been taken, with samples from torch marks and from the paintings themselves, as well as from animal bones and charcoal found on the cave floor. The radiocarbon dates from these samples suggest that there were two periods of creation in Chauvet: 35,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago. This would place the occupation and painting of the cave within the Aurignacian period. 

A research article published in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; in May 2012 by scientists from the University of Savoy, Aix-Marseille University and the Centre National de Prehistoire confirmed that the paintings were created by people in the Aurignacian era, between 30,000 and 32,000 years ago. The researchers&#x27; findings are based on the analysis using geomorphological and dating of the rock slide surfaces around what is believed to be the cave&#x27;s only entrance. Their analysis showed that the entrance was sealed by a collapsing cliff some 29,000 years ago. Their findings put the date of human presence in the cave and the paintings in line with that deduced from radiocarbon dating, i.e., between 32,000–30,000 years BP.

A 2016 study in the same journal examining 259 radiocarbon dates, some unpublished before, concluded that there were two phases of human occupation, one running from 37,000 to 33,500 years ago and the second from 31,000 to 28,000 years ago. All but two of the dates for the black drawings were from the earlier phase. The authors believe that the first phase ended with a rockfall that sealed the cave, with two more rockfalls at the end of the second occupation phase after which no humans or large animals entered the cave until it was rediscovered. In an email to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; two of the authors explained,
In 2020, researchers used the new IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration curve to estimate that the oldest painting in the cave was created 36,500 years ago.

In parallel with the dating carried out in Chauvet cave itself, from 2008 onwards, several members of the scientific team in charge of studying the cave undertook chronological research in other rock art sites along the Ardèche river gorges under the direction of Julien Monney. It took place at Points cave (Aiguèze; Gard; France), which presents flagrant iconographic similarities with Chauvet cave, but also at Deux-Ouvertures cave. Under the name of &quot;Datation Grottes Ornées&quot; (or DGO) project, this research is intended to determine the context in which the rock art caves of the region were visited. The DGO project proposes to discuss the apparent chronological and iconographic exceptionality of Chauvet cave &quot;from the outside&quot; by placing it within a regional ensemble. This research is still in progress (2020). However, it has already produced many results indirectly concerning the chronology of Chauvet cave.
== Preservation ==
The cave has been sealed off to the public since 1994. Access is severely restricted owing to the experience with decorated caves such as Altamira and Lascaux found in the 19th and 20th century, where the admission of visitors on a large scale led to the growth of mold on the walls that damaged the art in places. In 2000 the archaeologist and expert on cave paintings Dominique Baffier was appointed to oversee conservation and management of the cave. She was followed in 2014 by Marie Bardisa.

Caverne du Pont-d&#x27;Arc (&quot;Grotte Chauvet 2&quot;), a facsimile of Chauvet Cave on the model of the so-called &quot;Faux Lascaux&quot;, was opened to the general public on 25 April 2015. It is the largest cave replica ever built worldwide, ten times bigger than the Lascaux facsimile. The art is reproduced full-size in a condensed replica of the underground environment, in a circular building above ground, a few kilometres from the actual cave. Visitors&#x27; senses are stimulated by the same sensations of silence, darkness, temperature, humidity, and acoustics, carefully reproduced.

<text>The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a species of large freshwater turtle in the family Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. The present-day &quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot; population in the Middle Rio Grande suggests that the common snapping turtle has been present in this drainage since at least the seventeenth century and is likely native. The three species of &quot;Chelydra&quot; and the larger alligator snapping turtles (genus &quot;Macrochelys&quot;) are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.

The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the specific epithet &quot;serpentina&quot;, meaning &quot;snake-like&quot;). In water, it is likely to flee and hide underwater in sediment. The common snapping turtle has a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and iteroparity (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event.

Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15–20 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years.

==Anatomy and morphology==


&quot;C. serpentina&quot; has a rugged, muscular build with a ridged carapace (upper shell) that varies in color from tan, brown, and black, although ridges tend to be more pronounced in younger individuals. The straight-line carapace length in adulthood may be nearly , though is more common. &quot;C. serpentina&quot; usually weighs . Per one study, breeding common snapping turtles were found to average in carapace length, in plastron length and weigh about .

Males are larger than females, with almost all weighing in excess of being male and quite old, as the species continues to grow throughout life. Any specimen above the aforementioned weights is exceptional, but the heaviest wild specimen caught reportedly weighed . Common snapping turtles kept in captivity can be quite overweight due to overfeeding and have weighed as much as . In the northern part of its range, the common snapping turtle is often the heaviest native freshwater turtle.

According to a study by Nakamuta et al. (2016), common snapping turtles have well-developed olfactory organs, nerves, and bulbs that suggest that this species has a great sense of smell.

==Ecology and life history==
Common habitats are shallow ponds or streams. Some may inhabit brackish environments, such as estuaries. These sources of water tend to have an abundance of aquatic vegetation due to the shallow pools. Some describe them as habitat generalists as they can occupy most permanent bodies of water. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask—though rarely observed—by floating on the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snapping turtles may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath. Their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels.

Common snapping turtles are omnivorous. Important aquatic scavengers, they are also active hunters that use ambush tactics to prey on anything they can swallow, including many invertebrates, fish, frogs, other amphibians, reptiles (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary birds, and small mammals. In a recent study, young common snapping turtles showed that their lower bite force matches their active foraging behavior, meaning they have to travel and seek out more prey to make up for their inability to eat some items. In some areas adult common snapping turtles can occasionally be incidentally detrimental to breeding waterfowl, but their effect on such prey as ducklings and goslings is frequently exaggerated. As omnivorous scavengers though, they will also feed on carrion and a surprisingly large amount of aquatic vegetation.
Common snapping turtles have few predators when older, but eggs are subject to predation by crows, American mink, skunks, foxes, and raccoons. Egg predators use three types of cues to locate turtle nests:
*Visual cues – seeing where the female has dug the soil for the nest chamber and seeing the turtle
*Tactile cues – soft surface around the nest site
*Chemosensory cues – scent of the musk of the female that she leaves on the surface of the soil as she digs

As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack them as well as herons (mostly great blue herons), bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, American bullfrogs, large fish, and snakes. There are records during winter in Canada of hibernating adult common snapping turtles being ambushed and preyed on by northern river otters. Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include coyotes, American black bears, American alligators and their larger cousins, alligator snapping turtles. Large, old male common snapping turtles have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate.

These turtles travel extensively over land to reach new habitats or to lay eggs. Pollution, habitat destruction, food scarcity, overcrowding, and other factors drive snappers to move; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. Experimental data supports the idea that common snapping turtles can sense the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, which could also be used for such movements (together with a variety of other possible orientation cues).

This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold sperm for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often some distance from the water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the nest with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. These eggs have a leathery, flexible shell and they typically measure only 26-28 mm in diameter.

Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. One study on the incubation period of the common snapping turtle incubated the eggs at two temperatures: 20 °C (68 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F). The research found that the incubation period at the higher temperature was significantly shorter at approximately 63 days, while at the lower temperature the time was approximately 140 days. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The common snapping turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; radiotelemetry studies have shown some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter. In addition to incubation time, temperature also affects sex determination. It has been shown that females develop at low and high temperatures, while males develop in the intermediate temperature range. Fall temperatures had a positive effect on clutch size and clutch mass, whereas spring temperatures had no impact.

Common snapping turtle hatchlings have recently been found to make sounds before nest exit onto the surface, a phenomenon also known from species in the South American genus &quot;Podocnemis&quot; and the Ouachita map turtle. These sounds are mostly &quot;clicking&quot; noises, but other sounds, including those that sound somewhat like a “creak” or rubbing a finger along a fine-toothed comb, are also sometimes produced. 

In the northern part of their range common snapping turtles do not breathe for more than six months because ice covers their hibernating site. These turtles can get oxygen by pushing their head out of the mud and allowing gas exchange to take place through the membranes of their mouth and throat. This is known as extrapulmonary respiration.

If they cannot get enough oxygen through this method they start to utilize anaerobic pathways, burning sugars and fats without the use of oxygen. The metabolic by-products from this process are acidic and create very undesirable side effects by spring, which are known as oxygen debt. Although designated as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN redlist, the species has been designated in the Canadian part of its range as &quot;Special Concern&quot; due to its life history being sensitive to disruption by anthropogenic activity.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
Currently, no subspecies of the common snapping turtle are recognized. The former Florida subspecies &quot;osceola&quot; is currently considered a synonym of &quot;serpentina&quot;, while the other former subspecies &quot;Chelydra rossignonii&quot; and &quot;Chelydra acutirostris&quot; are both recognized as full species.

== Behavior ==
When they encounter a species unfamiliar to them such as humans, in rare instances, they will become curious and survey the situation and even more rarely may bump their nose on a leg of the person standing in the water. Although common snapping turtles have fierce dispositions, when they are encountered in the water or a swimmer approaches, they will slip quietly away from any disturbance or may seek shelter under mud or grass nearby.

==Relationship with humans==
===As food===
The common snapping turtle is a traditional ingredient in turtle soup; consumption in large quantities, however, can become a health concern due to potential concentration of toxic environmental pollutants in the turtle&#x27;s flesh.

===Captivity===
The common snapping turtle is not an ideal pet. Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if picked up by the sides of its shell. The claws are as sharp as those of bears and cannot be trimmed as can dog claws. The turtle uses its paws like a bear for hunting and slicing food, while biting it. Despite this, a common snapping turtle cannot use its claws for either attacking (its legs have no speed or strength in &quot;swiping&quot; motions) or eating (no opposable thumbs), but only as aids for digging and gripping. Veterinary care is best left to a reptile specialist. A wild common snapping turtle will make a hissing sound when it is threatened or encountered, but they prefer not to provoke confrontations.

It is a common misconception that common snapping turtles may be safely picked up by the tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the vertebral column. Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous. Snappers can stretch their necks back across their own carapace and to their hind feet on either side to bite. When they feel stressed, they release a musky odor from behind their legs.

It may be tempting to rescue a common snapping turtle found on a road by getting it to bite a stick and then dragging it out of immediate danger. This action can, however, severely scrape the legs and underside of the turtle and lead to deadly infections in the wounds. The safest way to pick up a common snapping turtle is by grasping the carapace behind the back legs, being careful to not grasp the tail. There is a large gap behind the back legs that allows for easy grasping of the carapace and keeps hands safe from both the beak and claws of the turtle. It can also be picked up with a shovel, from the back, making sure the shovel is square across the bottom of the shell. The easiest way, though, is with a blanket or tarp, picking up the corners with the turtle in the middle.

Common snapping turtles are raised on some turtle farms in Mainland China.

===In politics===
The common snapping turtle was the central feature of a famous American political cartoon. Published in 1808 in protest at the Jeffersonian Embargo Act of 1807, the cartoon depicted a common snapping turtle, jaws locked fiercely to an American trader who was attempting to carry a barrel of goods onto a British ship. The trader was seen whimsically uttering the words &quot;Oh! this cursed Ograbme&quot; (&quot;embargo&quot; spelled backwards, and also &quot;O, grab me&quot; as the turtle is doing). This piece is widely considered a pioneering work within the genre of the modern political cartoon.

In 2006, the common snapping turtle was declared the state reptile of New York by vote of the New York Legislature after being chosen by the state&#x27;s public elementary school children.

===Reputation===
While it is widely rumored that common snapping turtles can bite off human fingers or toes, and their powerful jaws are more than capable of doing so, no proven cases have ever been presented for this species, as they use their overall size and strength to deter would-be predators. Common snapping turtles are &quot;quite docile&quot; animals underwater that prefer to avoid confrontations rather than provoke them.

The ability to bite forcefully is extremely useful for consuming hard-bodied prey items such as mollusks, crustaceans, and turtles along with some plant matter, like nuts and seeds. In 2002, a study reported in the &quot;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&quot; found that the common snapping turtle (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;) registered between 208 and 226 Newtons of force when it came to jaw strength. In comparison, the average bite force of a human (molars area) is between 300 and 700 Newtons. Another non-closely related species known as the alligator snapping turtle has been known to bite off fingers, and at least three documented cases are known.

==Invasive species==
In recent years in Italy, large mature adult &quot;C. serpentina&quot; turtles have been taken from bodies of water throughout the country. They were most probably introduced by the release of unwanted pets. In March 2011, an individual weighing was captured in a canal near Rome; another individual was captured near Rome in September 2012.

In Japan, the species was introduced as an exotic pet in the 1960s; it has been recorded as the source of serious bite injuries. In 2004 and 2005, some 1,000 individuals were found in Chiba Prefecture, making up the majority of individuals believed to have been introduced.

==Conservation==
The species is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, but has declined sufficiently due to pressure from collection for the pet trade and habitat degradation that Canada and several U.S. states have enacted or are proposing stricter conservation measures. In Canada, it is listed as &quot;Special Concern&quot; in the Species at Risk Act in 2011 and is a target species for projects that include surveys, identification of major habitats, investigation and mitigation of threats, and education of the public including landowners. Involved bodies include governmental departments, universities, museums, and citizen science projects.

Although common snapping turtles are listed as a species of least concern, anthropogenic factors still may have major effects on populations. Decades of road mortality may cause severe population decline in common snapping turtle populations present in urbanized wetlands. A study in southwestern Ontario monitored a population near a busy roadway and found a loss of 764 individuals in only 17 years. The population decreased from 941 individuals in 1985 to 177 individuals in 2002. Road mortality may put common snapping turtle populations at risk of extirpation. Exclusion fencing could aid in decreasing population loss.

<text>The Foursquare Church is an international Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1923 by evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. It lies within the evangelical tradition. Its headquarters are in Los Angeles, California, United States.

==History==

The church has its origins in a vision of &quot;Foursquare Gospel&quot; (or &quot;Full Gospel&quot;) during a sermon in October 1922 in Oakland, California, by the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson who was originally an ordained evangelist of the Assemblies of God where she once exerted a large influence until the split. According to chapter 1 of Book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel had a vision of God as revealed to be four different aspects: a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle. It also represents the four aspects of Christ: &quot;Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer and Soon and Coming King.&quot; This was the vision and name she gave at Foursquare Church, founded in January 1923 in Los Angeles, during the dedication of the Angelus Temple in Echo Park, seating 5,300 people. Despite some affinities with Pentecostals, her beliefs are interdenominational. The attendance has become a megachurch with 10,000 people. McPherson was a flamboyant celebrity in her day, participating in publicity events, such as weekly Sunday parades through the streets of Los Angeles, along with the mayor and movie stars, directly to Angelus Temple. She built the temple, as well as what is now known as Life Pacific University adjacent to it, on the northwest corner of land that she owned in the middle of the city.

McPherson&#x27;s celebrity status continued after her death, with biopics such as the 1976 Hallmark Hall of Fame drama &quot;The Disappearance of Aimee&quot; depicting her life, as well as the 2006 independent film &quot;Aimee Semple McPherson&quot;, which particularly focused on her month-long disappearance in May–June 1926 and the legal controversy that followed.

After Aimee Semple McPherson&#x27;s death in 1944, her son Rolf K. McPherson became president and leader of the church, a position he held for 44 years. The Foursquare Church formed the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa, in an alliance with the Assemblies of God, the Church of God, the Open Bible Standard Churches, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and others. In 1994, 46 years after the founding of the Pentecostal Fellowship, it was reorganized as the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America after combining with African-American organizations, most significantly the Church of God in Christ.

In 1968, the Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa congregation of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (under pastor Chuck Smith) broke from the denomination and later formed an association of autonomous Charismatic Evangelical churches, today making up the Charismatic but non-Pentecostal denomination, Calvary Chapel.

On May 31, 1988, John R. Holland became the Church&#x27;s third president and held the position until July 1997.

Harold Helms served as interim president from July 1997 to July 1998 and was followed by Paul C. Risser, who became the president on April 16, 1998, at the church&#x27;s 75th annual convention.

In October 2003, under Risser&#x27;s tenure, the church sold the Los Angeles radio station KFSG-FM to the Spanish Broadcasting System for $250 million. Risser&#x27;s leadership led to another high-profile controversy for the church, when, without the involvement of the denomination&#x27;s board of directors and finance council, church funds were invested in firms that targeted the &quot;close-knit evangelical community&quot; but turned out to be Ponzi schemes. Risser resigned his leadership position under fire in March 2004.

Jack W. Hayford, the founder of The Church On The Way in Van Nuys, California, served as the president of the Foursquare Church from 2004 to 2009. Hayford, along with Pastors Roy Hicks Jr. in Eugene, Oregon, Jerry Cook in Gresham, Oregon, Ronald D. Mehl of the Beaverton Foursquare Church in Beaverton, Oregon, and John Holland in Vancouver, British Columbia, have been credited by the church with setting a plan for the denomination&#x27;s continued survival despite its staggering financial losses estimated at $15 million under the failed leadership of Paul Risser.

In 2020, Randy Remington became the President of The Foursquare Church.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2022, it had 67,500 churches, with 8.8 million members in 150 countries.

According to the 2010 US Religion Census, there are over 320,000 members in the United States and 1,823 churches.

==Beliefs==
The beliefs of the Foursquare Church are expressed in its Declaration of Faith, compiled by its founder, Aimee Semple McPherson. McPherson also authored a shorter, more concise creedal statement.

The church believes in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the deity of Jesus Christ. It believes that human beings were created in the image of God but, because of the Fall, are naturally depraved and sinful. The church believes in the substitutionary atonement, accomplished by the death of Christ, and teaches that salvation is by grace through faith, not by good works. Believers are justified by faith and born again upon repentance and acceptance of Christ as Lord and king. Consistent with its belief in human free will, the Foursquare Church also teaches that it is possible for a believer to backslide or commit apostasy.

The Foursquare Church, a Finished Work Pentecostal denomination, teaches that sanctification is a continual process of spiritual growth. Spiritual growth is believed to be promoted by Bible study and prayer. The Foursquare Church believes in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an event separate from conversion that empowers the individual and the wider church to fulfill the church&#x27;s mission of evangelization. The Foursquare Church believes Holy Spirit baptism is received in the same manner as recorded in the Book of Acts: the believer can expect to speak in tongues. The church believes that spiritual gifts continue in operation for the edification of the church.

The Foursquare Church believes that divine healing is a part of Christ&#x27;s atonement and teaches that the sick can be healed in response to prayer. The Foursquare Church anticipates a premillennial return of Christ to earth. It believes that there will be a future final judgment where the righteous will receive everlasting life and the wicked everlasting punishment. The Foursquare Church observes believer&#x27;s baptism by immersion and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, or Holy Communion, as ordinances. Open communion is practiced. Anointing of the sick and tithing are practiced as well.

==Structure==
The denomination&#x27;s church government has an &quot;episcopal character&quot; that dates back to its founder. McPherson had veto power over church decisions, appointed all officers, and hired all employees.

The Foursquare Convention is the chief decision making body of the Foursquare Church. Meeting regularly every year, the convention&#x27;s voting membership includes international officers and licensed ministers. Each Foursquare church located in the United States has the right to send one voting delegate per every 50 church members. National Foursquare Churches outside of the United States may send one official delegate to the convention.

A board of 12 to 24 directors manages the Foursquare Church. In addition to overseeing the Church&#x27;s activities, the board of directors appoints officers and is responsible for licensing and ordaining ministers. Members of the board include the president, vice presidents, and at least nine ministers representing geographic regions. Church members in good standing may also be appointed to the board.

Local Foursquare churches are subordinate parts of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and are operated according to the bylaws of the international church. There are two categories of Foursquare churches. A &quot;charter member church&quot; is a member church that has no legal existence apart from the international church and whose property is owned by the international church. The second category is &quot;covenant member church&quot;, which include &quot;pioneer churches&quot; and previously non-member churches. Pioneer churches are recently-established church plants that have not been upgraded to charter member status. Covenant member churches might also be previously non-member churches that join the Foursquare Church but choose not to transfer their real property to the international church. Non-member churches may choose to affiliate with the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel without becoming a full member of the international church. These &quot;community member churches&quot; retain their separate legal identities and autonomy.

==North America==
Three colleges are affiliated with the Foursquare Church: Life Pacific University, formerly &quot;L. I. F. E. Bible College,&quot; in San Dimas, California, Life Pacific College Virginia in Christiansburg, Virginia, and Pacific Life Bible College in Surrey, British Columbia.

In 2006, membership in the United States was 353,995 in 1,875 churches. In 2023, the number of churches in the U.S. was reported at 2,021. While congregations are concentrated along the West Coast, the denomination is well distributed across the United States. The states with the highest membership rates are Oregon, Hawaii, Montana, Washington, and California.

==South America==
===Ecuador===
The Foursquare Church arrived in Ecuador in 1956 with the arrival of a couple by the name of Gadberry. Acting as missionaries under the auspices of the Los Angeles congregation, they began by founding churches in Guayaquil. They remained in Ecuador until 1960, but returned a year later to found the first Foursquare church in Quito. As of 2012, there were 200 Foursquare churches in Ecuador, with 32 in Guayaquil alone.

==Controversies==
In 2004, the denomination&#x27;s president and treasurer resigned after losing $14 million of the denomination for approving two financial investment projects that were in fact a scam.

In 2013, under Glenn Burris Jr.&#x27;s leadership, the church lost $2 million in a failed investment of a Broadway play based on the life of Aimee Semple McPherson.

<doc id="440878" wikidata="Q1336942" url="?curid=440878" title="New York City Ballet">
<text>New York City Ballet (NYCB) is a ballet company founded in 1948 by choreographer George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein. Balanchine and Jerome Robbins are considered the founding choreographers of the company. Léon Barzin was the company&#x27;s first music director. City Ballet grew out of earlier troupes: the Producing Company of the School of American Ballet, 1934; the American Ballet, 1935, and Ballet Caravan, 1936, which merged into American Ballet Caravan, 1941; and directly from the Ballet Society, 1946.

== History ==
In a 1946 letter, Kirstein stated, &quot;The only justification I have is to enable Balanchine to do exactly what he wants to do in the way he wants to do it.&quot; He served as the company&#x27;s General Director from 1946 to 1989, developing and sustaining it by his organizational and fundraising abilities.

The company was named New York City Ballet in 1948 when it became resident at City Center of Music and Drama. Its success was marked by its move to the New York State Theater, now David H. Koch Theater, designed by Philip Johnson to Balanchine&#x27;s specifications. City Ballet became the first ballet company in the United States to have two permanent venue engagements: one at Lincoln Center&#x27;s David H. Koch Theater on 63rd Street in Manhattan, and another at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, in Saratoga Springs, New York. The School of American Ballet (S.A.B.), which Balanchine founded, is the training school of the company.

After the company&#x27;s move to the State Theater, Balanchine&#x27;s creativity as a choreographer flourished. He created works that were the basis of the company&#x27;s repertory until his death in 1983. He worked closely with choreographer Jerome Robbins, who resumed his connection with the company in 1969 after having produced works for Broadway.

NYCB still has the largest repertoire by far of any American ballet company. It often stages 60 ballets or more in its winter and spring seasons at Lincoln Center each year, and 20 or more in its summer season in Saratoga Springs. City Ballet has performed &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and many more. City Ballet has trained and developed many great dancers since its formation. Many dancers with already developed reputations have also joined the ballet as principal dancers:
* Merrill Ashley
* Mikhail Baryshnikov
* Ashley Bouder
* Jacques d&#x27;Amboise
* Suzanne Farrell
* Melissa Hayden
* Sterling Hyltin
* Jillana
* Allegra Kent
* Gelsey Kirkland
* Tanaquil LeClercq
* Nicholas Magallanes
* Peter Martins
* Nilas Martins
* Patricia McBride
* Sara Mearns
* Monique Meunier
* Arthur Mitchell
* Francisco Moncion
* Kyra Nichols
* Tiler Peck
* Unity Phelan
* Teresa Reichlen
* Jock Soto
* Maria Tallchief
* Edward Villella
=== Salute to Italy === 

In 1960, Balanchine mounted City Ballet&#x27;s &quot;Salute to Italy&quot; with premieres of &quot;Monumentum pro Gesualdo&quot; and &quot;Variations from Don Sebastian&quot; (called the &quot;Donizetti Variations&quot; since 1961), as well as performances of his &quot;La Sonnambula&quot; and Lew Christensen&#x27;s &quot;Con Amore&quot;. The performance was repeated in 1968.

=== Stravinsky Festival === 

In 1972, Balanchine offered an eight-day tribute to the composer, his great collaborator, who had died the year before. His programs included twenty-two new works of his own dances, plus works by choreographers Todd Bolender, John Clifford, Lorca Massine, Jerome Robbins, Richard Tanner, and John Taras, as well as repertory ballets by Balanchine and Robbins. Balanchine created &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot;, &quot;Duo Concertant&quot;, and &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; for the occasion. He and Robbins co-choreographed and performed in &quot;Pulcinella&quot;. Balanchine had produced an earlier Stravinsky festival in 1937 as balletmaster of the American Ballet while engaged by the Metropolitan Opera. The composer conducted the April 27th premiere of &quot;Card Party&quot;.

=== Ravel Festival === 
In 1975, Balanchine paid his respects to the French composer Maurice Ravel with a two-week &quot;Hommage à Ravel&quot;. Balanchine, Robbins, Jacques d&#x27;Amboise, and Taras made sixteen new ballets for the occasion. Repertory ballets were performed as well. High points included Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot; and Robbins&#x27; &quot;Mother Goose&quot;.

=== Tschaikovsky Festival === 
In 1981, Balanchine planned a two-week NYCB festival honoring the Russian composer Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky. Balanchine, Joseph Duell, d&#x27;Amboise, Peter Martins, Robbins, and Taras created twelve new dances. In addition to presenting these and repertory ballets, Balanchine re-choreographed his &quot;Mozartiana&quot; from 1933. Philip Johnson and John Burgee&#x27;s stage setting of translucent tubing was designed to be hung and lit in different architectural configurations throughout the entire festival.

=== Stravinsky Centennial Celebration ===

In 1982, Balanchine organized a centennial celebration in honor of his long-time collaborator Igor Stravinsky, during which the City Ballet performed twenty-five ballets set to the composer&#x27;s music. Balanchine made three new ballets, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Élégie&quot;, and &quot;Persephone&quot;, and a new version of &quot;Variations&quot;. The choreographer died the following year. Balanchine&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Celebration was held by the company in 2002.

=== New York State Theater 20-Year Celebration ===
On April 26, 1984, NYCB celebrated the 20th anniversary of the New York State Theater. The program started with Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for a New Theater,&quot; followed by Stravinsky&#x27;s arrangement of The Star-Spangled Banner. The ballets included three of Balanchine&#x27;s works, Serenade, Stravinsky Violin Concerto, and &quot;Sonatine&quot;; and Jerome Robbins&#x27; Afternoon of a Faun. The performers included Maria Calegari, Kyra Nichols, Heather Watts, Leonid Kozlov, Afshin Mofid, Patricia McBride, Helgi Tomasson, Karin von Aroldingen, Lourdes Lopez, Bart Cook, and Joseph Duell.

===Peter Martins===
After Balanchine&#x27;s death in 1983, Peter Martins was selected as balletmaster of the company. After 30 years, Martins was judged to have maintained the New York City Ballet&#x27;s financial security and the musicality and performance level of the dancers, but he has not emphasized the Balanchine style to the extent that many observers expected he would. Martins retired from his position in 2018.

==== American Music Festival ====
For the company&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Martins held an American Music Festival, having commissioned dances from choreographers Laura Dean, Eliot Feld, William Forsythe, Lar Lubovitch, Paul Taylor. He also presented ballets by George Balanchine and Robbins. The programs included world premieres of more than twenty dances. Martins contributed &quot;Barber Violin Concerto&quot;, &quot;Black and White&quot;, &quot;The Chairman Dances&quot;, &quot;A Fool for You&quot;, &quot;Fred and George&quot;, &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, &quot;Tanzspiel&quot;, &quot;Tea-Rose&quot;, and &quot;The Waltz Project&quot;.

=== Jerome Robbins celebration ===
A major component of the Spring 2008 season was a celebration of Jerome Robbins; major revivals were mounted of the following ballets:
* &quot;2 and 3 Part Inventions&quot;
* &quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot;

Friday, June 27, 2008, the first &quot;Dancers&#x27; Choice&quot; benefit was held for the Dancers&#x27; Emergency Fund. The program was initiated by Peter Martins, conceived and supervised by principal dancer Jonathan Stafford, assisted by Kyle Froman, Craig Hall, Amanda Hankes, Adam Hendrickson, Ask la Cour, Henry Seth, and Daniel Ulbricht, and consisted of:
* &quot;Beethoven Romance&quot;
* &quot;Flit of Fury/The Monarch&quot;

On June 14, 2009, the second &quot;Dancers&#x27; Choice&quot; benefit was held at a special evening performance. The program included &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Union Jack&quot;. The program was supervised by principal dancer Jenifer Ringer.

== Programming ==

NYCB performs fall, winter and spring repertory seasons at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center as well as George Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker&quot; during November and December; they have a summer residency at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and regularly tour internationally.

Introductory talks about a current performance, called First Position Discussions, are held before some performances or during some intervals in the fourth ring, house right; the docents are volunteers and include laymen as well as former dancers. Hour-long Inside NYCB events explore the history and inner workings of the company through performance and discussion, often with dancers and artistic staff.

Other public programs include Family Saturdays, one-hour interactive programs for children 5 and up; Children&#x27;s Workshops and In Motion Workshops, pre-performance explorations of the music, movement, and themes of a ballet featured in the matinee performance for children ages 5–8 and 9–11, respectively; and Ballet Essentials, a 75-minute informal ballet class for adults ages 21 and up with little to no prior dance experience. These programs are all facilitated by NYCB dancers.

== $30 for 30 and Fourth Ring Society/Society NYCB ==

New York City Ballet offers tickets for $30 to select performances for patrons ages 13 to 30 at the box office, or online or by phone with an account; sales for each performance week (Tue. evening through Sun. matinee) begin at 10:00 a.m. on the Monday of that week.

New York City Ballet&#x27;s Fourth Ring Society offered discounted tickets to all shows in the theater&#x27;s Fourth Ring for a small annual fee. This program was closed to new members in 2011 and renamed Society NYCB to reflect an expanded offering of discounted seats in all sections of the theater, although over time a few ballet programs (e.g., Nutcracker) and individual dates became unavailable.

== New York Choreographic Institute ==

City Ballet&#x27;s Choreographic Institute was founded by Irene Diamond and Peter Martins in 2000. It has three main programmatic programs: choreographic sessions, providing choreographers with dancers and studio space; fellowship initiatives, annual awards in support of an emerging choreographer affiliated with a ballet company; and choreographic forums, symposia and round-table discussions on choreography, music, and design elements.

== The New York City Ballet Orchestra ==
The 66-member NYCB Orchestra is an important symphonic institution in its own right, having played for virtually all of the thousands of performances NYCB has given over the decades. It is one of the most versatile orchestras in the world, on any given week performing perhaps three or four times the repertoire that another symphony might be expected to do. Principal players of the orchestra also perform the majority of the concertos, other solos, and chamber music in the NYCB repertory as well. The orchestra accompanies the ballet on all of its North American tours, and while the ballet uses local orchestras on its international tours, members of the NYCB Orchestra often go along as soloists or extras.

Besides the members of the orchestra, the NYCB has six pianists on full-time staff. They all perform in the pit with the orchestra on a regular basis.

The NYCB Orchestra also occasionally accompanies dance companies from other cities at the Koch Theater. These have included the Australian Ballet in the Spring 2012, and the San Francisco Ballet in the Fall 2013.

In January 2019, it was announced that an anonymous donor had funded the renaming of the orchestra pit as the &quot;Stravinsky Orchestra Pit&quot; .

==Controversies==
===Misconduct allegations against Peter Martins===
In December 2017, Martins took a leave of absence from the New York City Ballet following an allegation of sexual misconduct made against him. Five dancers of the New York City Ballet later told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that Martins had verbally or physically abused them; Martins denied engaging in any misconduct. Martins retired from the City Ballet on January 1, 2018. An independent inquiry commissioned by NYCB and SAB and led by employment-law attorney Barbara E. Hoey did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence made against Martins, according to a joint statement issued by the company and school. The report itself was not made public.

===Nude photos allegation===
In September 2018, Alexandra Waterbury, an ex-girlfriend of NYCB principal dancer Chase Finlay, began a civil action in New York County Supreme Court against Finlay, principal dancers Amar Ramasar and Zachary Catazaro, NYCB patron Jared Longhitano, New York City Ballet and SAB. Her lawsuit claimed harm by Finlay for allegedly taking and sharing sexually explicit photos and videos of Waterbury without her knowledge or consent, and by Ramasar, Catazaro, Longhitano, NYCB and SAB for allegedly contributing to that harm in various ways.

All defendants disputed key factual allegations made in the complaint as well as their liability as a matter of law; they all filed motions to dismiss. Waterbury&#x27;s lawsuit led to Finlay&#x27;s resignation and the firing of Ramasar and Catazaro. In April 2019 an arbitrator ordered Ramasar and Catazaro reinstated; Catazaro decided not to rejoin the company. Although there were no public reports of a settlement agreement, in February 2023, Waterbury agreed to withdraw &quot;with prejudice&quot; (i.e., permanently) all claims against NYCB and Finlay &quot;without costs or attorneys&#x27; fees to any party.&quot;

<text>John Daniel Baskeyfield (18 November 1922 – 20 September 1944) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces.

Born in 1922, Baskeyfield was called up to the British Army in early 1942. He served with the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, a glider infantry unit of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, part of the 1st Airborne Division, in Sicily and Italy in 1943 before returning to the United Kingdom. The division was next deployed in Operation Market Garden and fought in the subsequent Battle of Arnhem.

While defending the Oosterbeek perimeter three days into the battle, Baskeyfield commanded a pair of anti-tank guns that destroyed several enemy tanks before the crews were killed. Baskeyfield subsequently fired the guns alone before he too was killed. His body was not identified after the war and he has no known grave.

==Early life==
John Baskeyfield was born on 18 November 1922 in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, England, the son of Daniel and Minnie Baskeyfield. He trained and worked as a butcher during the early years of the Second World War, until he received his call up papers in February 1942 at the age of 19.

==Early military service==
Baskeyfield joined the South Staffordshire Regiment and served with the 2nd Battalion&#x27;s anti-tank platoon. The 2nd Battalion was part of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, itself part of the 1st Airborne Division and Baskeyfield accompanied them to North Africa, from where they took part in Operation Ladbroke, the glider-borne element of the Invasion of Sicily in 1943. The division then landed in Italy as part of Operation Slapstick and spent some weeks fighting their way through the country before sailing back to England.

==Battle of Arnhem==
The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, an attempt to secure a string of bridges through the Netherlands. At Arnhem the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine, the final objectives of the operation. However, the airborne forces that dropped on 17 September were not aware that the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer divisions were also near Arnhem for rest and refit. Their presence added a substantial number of Panzergrenadiers, tanks and self-propelled guns to the German defences and the Allies suffered heavily in the ensuing battle. Only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge before being overrun on 21 September. The rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge and had to be evacuated on 25 September in Operation Berlin. The Allies failed to cross the Rhine, which remained under German control until Allied offensives in March 1945.

===South Staffordshire&#x27;s advance===

Owing to a shortage of aircraft, the Allies planned to fly the entire division to Arnhem over three days. The South Staffordshire Battalion was split between the lifts on day one and day two; most of the unit arrived on day one, with the rest arriving with the second lift. The battalion&#x27;s anti-tank guns were flown from RAF Manston on day one.

Major General Roy Urquhart&#x27;s original plan envisaged the 1st Airlanding Brigade securing the drop zones for subsequent lifts, but by the end of day one the Allied advance into Arnhem had stalled. Only a small group of the 1st Parachute Brigade, mainly elements of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, were able to reach the bridge. The 1st and 3rd Battalions were unable to penetrate the outer suburbs of the city and their advance stalled, so in order to support them the first lift of the South Stafford&#x27;s were sent forward on the morning of 18 September. When the second lift arrived later that day they too were sent forward and arrived at the outskirts of Arnhem that night. The South Staffordshire&#x27;s anti-tank platoon was kept in the divisional area.

In the early hours of the morning of 19 September, an attack was launched on a narrow front between the river and the railway line, in order to force a passage through to the bridge. Most of the support weapons were left in the rear, as they were unable to suitably deploy in the dark and in the narrow confines of the urban surroundings. However, in the face of strong enemy positions and armour, the attack faltered and the British were routed.

===Withdrawal to Oosterbeek===
 The remnants of the four battalions fell back in disarray to the main divisional positions at Oosterbeek. Here they were gathered into defensive units by Lieutenant Colonel Sheriff Thompson, Commanding Officer of the 1st Airlanding Light Artillery Regiment, who forcibly stopped many of the panicked troops and had Major Robert Cain form them into a defensive screen half a mile in front of his own 75 mm howitzers positions. The sector was designated &quot;Thompson Force&quot;, but Thompson actually sent Major Richard Lonsdale forward to take command of these outlying troops later in the day.

The German forces made determined attacks against Lonsdale&#x27;s force on 20 September, starting soon after dawn. Baskeyfield was in charge of two 6 pounder anti–tank guns defending a T junction on the &quot;Benedendorpsweg&quot;, the southernmost road between Arnhem and Oosterbeek. Baskeyfield&#x27;s guns faced up the &quot;Acacialaan&quot;, which joined the &quot;Benedendorpsweg&quot; from the north, and covered the likely enemy approach along this road and from open ground to the north east. His right flank – to the east – was covered by another anti-tank gun commanded by Lance-Sergeant Mansell.

In an initial German assault, Baskeyfield and his gun crews destroyed two tanks and a self-propelled gun as they advanced down the &quot;Acacialaan&quot;. Baskeyfield allowed the armour to come within 100 yards of his positions before ordering his crews to fire, while paratroopers of the 11th Battalion in nearby houses dealt with attacking infantry. In the course of this action, Baskeyfield&#x27;s crew was killed or wounded and Baskeyfield himself was badly injured. However he refused to be evacuated and in a later German attack he worked his gun alone, loading, laying and firing it himself. He fired round after round until enemy fire put his gun out of action, and he crawled to the second gun, whose crew had similarly been disabled. From here he engaged another self-propelled gun, dispatching it with two rounds, but was killed shortly afterwards by fire from another German tank.

Lonsdale&#x27;s men fell back to new positions later that day and &quot;Thompson Force&quot; was renamed &quot;Lonsdale Force&quot; when Thompson was wounded on 21 September. The force continued to hold the Oosterbeek perimeter until the Allies withdrew in Operation Berlin on the night of 25 September.

===Victoria Cross===

The full citation for Baskeyfield&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 23 November 1944, reading:

==Legacy==

After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. Over 1700 men were buried in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery, but Baskeyfield&#x27;s body was never identified. Although several hundred burials in the cemetery are unidentified, there are no records of any unidentified soldiers being exhumed from &quot;Acacialaan&quot;. Instead Baskeyfield&#x27;s name is inscribed on the Groesbeek Memorial which commemorates all those Allied servicemen killed between August 1944 and the end of the conflict who have no known grave. Four more VCs were awarded after the battle, including one for Major Robert Cain, commander of B Company, 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. The 2nd Battalion thus became the only British battalion to receive two VCs during one engagement in the Second World War.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in Whittington, Staffordshire. A twice life size memorial statue of him was erected in 1990 at Festival Heights in Stoke-on-Trent, by sculptors Steven Whyte and Michael Talbot. The John Baskeyfield V.C. Church of England Primary School in Burslem was named after him but was renamed Saint Nathaniel&#x27;s Academy on 1 March 2014.
Baskeyfield is commemorated by the retirement community at Baskeyfield House, Angels Way, Burslem, built in 2015, and by the Army Reserve Centre, also called Baskeyfield House, at Anchor Road, Stoke-on-Trent. The artist Terence Cuneo made a painting of Baskeyfield&#x27;s action, and in 1969 a Staffordshire filmmaker spent three years making a short film about his role in the battle, entitled &quot;Baskeyfield VC&quot;. A tree on the site of Baskeyfield&#x27;s second gun, on the corner of &quot;Benedendorpsweg&quot; and &quot;Acacialaan&quot;, has been named the Jack Baskeyfield Tree.

<text>The Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post (AACP), the current &quot;Nightwatch&quot; aircraft, is a series of strategic command and control military aircraft operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). The E-4 series are specially modified from the Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) program.

The E-4 serves as a survivable mobile command post for the National Command Authority, namely the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and successors. The four E-4s are operated by the 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron of the 595th Command and Control Group located at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska. An E-4 when in action is denoted a &quot;National Airborne Operations Center&quot; (NAOC) and has been nicknamed the &quot;Doomsday plane&quot;.

==Development==
Two of the original 747-200 airframes were originally planned to be commercial airliners. When the airline did not complete the order, Boeing offered the airframes to the United States Air Force, as part of a package leading to a replacement for the older EC-135J National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP). Under the 481B NEACP program the Air Force Electronic Systems Division awarded Boeing a contract in February 1973 for two unequipped aircraft, designated E-4A, powered by four P&amp;W JT9D engines, to which a third aircraft was added in July 1973.

In 1973, the first E-4A was completed at the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington. E-Systems won the contract to install interim equipment in these three aircraft. In July 1973, the first completed E-4A was delivered to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The next two were delivered in October 1973 and October 1974. The third E-4A was powered by the GE F103 engine, which was later made standard and retrofitted to the previous two aircraft. The A-model effectively housed the same equipment as the EC-135, but offered more space and an ability to remain aloft longer than an EC-135.
In November 1973, it was reported that the program cost was estimated to total $548 million, equivalent to $ billion in for seven 747s, with six as operational command posts and one more for research and development.

In December 1973, a fourth aircraft was ordered. It was fitted with more advanced equipment, resulting in the designation E-4B. On 21 December 1979, Boeing delivered the first E-4B, AF Serial Number 75-0125, which was distinguished from the earlier version by the presence of a large streamlined radome on the dorsal surface directly behind the upper deck. This contains the aircraft&#x27;s SHF satellite antenna.

By January 1985, all three E-4As had been retrofitted to E-4B models. The E-4B offered a vast increase in communications capability over the previous model and was considered to be &#x27;hardened&#x27; against the effects of a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from a nuclear explosion. Hardening the aircraft meant that all equipment and wiring on board was shielded from an EMP.

In 2005, the Air Force awarded Boeing a five-year, US$2 billion contract, equivalent to $ billion in , for the continued upgrade of the E-4B fleet. In addition to the purchase and upgrade costs, the E-4 costs nearly $160,000 per hour, , for the Air Force to operate. The E-4B fleet had an estimated unit cost of approximately US$223.2 million each in 2024.

==Design==
The E-4B is designed to survive an EMP with systems intact, and has state-of-the-art direct fire countermeasures. Many older aircraft have been upgraded with glass cockpits. The E-4B still uses traditional analog flight instruments, as they are less susceptible to damage from an EMP blast.

The E-4B is capable of operating with a crew up to 112 people, including flight and mission personnel, the largest crew of any aircraft in US Air Force history. With in-flight aerial refueling it is capable of remaining airborne for a considerable period, limited only by consumption of the engines&#x27; lubricants. In a test flight for endurance, the aircraft remained airborne and fully operational for 35.4 hours. It is designed to be able to remain airborne for a full week in the event of an emergency. It takes two fully loaded KC-135 tankers to fully refuel an E-4B. The E-4B has three operational decks: upper, middle, and lower.

=== Middle deck ===

The middle deck contains the conference room, which provides a secure area for conferences and briefings. It contains a conference table for nine people. Aft of the conference room is a projection room serving the conference room and the briefing room. The projection room had the capability of projecting computer graphics, overhead transparencies, or 35 mm slides to the conference room and/or the briefing room, and has since been modernized with flat screen displays.

The battle staff includes various controllers, planners, launch system officers, communications operators, a weather officer, administrative and support personnel, and a chief of battle staff. The Operation Looking Glass missions were commanded by a general officer with two staff officers. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) may rendezvous and embark a member of the National Command Authority (NCA) from an undisclosed location. There are at least 48 crew aboard any E-4B mission.

Behind the briefing room is the operations team area, containing the automatic data processing equipment and seats and console work areas for 29 staff members. The consoles are configured to provide access to or from the automated data processing, automatic switchboard, direct access telephone and radio circuits, direct (&quot;hot&quot;) lines, monitor panel for switchboard lines, staff, and operator inter-phone and audio recorder.

The aft compartment at the end of the main deck is the Technical Control (Tech Control) area. This area was the nerve center for all communications and communications technicians. Typically three of the six crew positions were occupied here by specialized US Air Force technicians that were responsible for the proper monitoring and distribution of all communications power, cooling, and reliability. 

The Technical Controller No. 1 (Tech 1, TC1) was the direct interface with the aircraft Flight Engineer and Flight Crew. This position was also the main focal point for all communications related issues. The Technical Controller No. 2 (Tech 2, TC2) was responsible for maintaining all UHF communications between the aircraft and the Nightwatch GEP (Ground Entry Points). These GEP&#x27;s provided 12 voice lines to the aircraft which were used in the day-to-day operations of the mission. Secure Voice was provided. The SHF Operator (or technician) maintained the SHF satellite link and provided other worldwide communications services, probably having replaced a lot of the UHF capabilities.

The rest area, which occupies the remaining portion of the aft main deck, provides a rest and sleeping area for the crew members. The rest area contains storage for food and is used for religious ceremonies.

Within the forward entry area is the main galley unit and stairways to the flight deck and to the forward lower equipment area. This area contains refrigerators, freezers, two convection ovens, and a microwave oven to give stewards the capability to provide more than 100 hot meals during prolonged missions. Four seats are located on the left side of the forward entry area for the secret service and the stewards.

Behind the forward entry area, is the National Command Authority (NCA) area, which is designed and furnished as an executive suite. It contains an office, a lounge, a sleeping area, and a dressing room. Telephone instruments in this area provide the NCA with secure and clear worldwide communications.

The briefing room contains a briefing table with three executive seats, eighteen additional seats, a lectern, and two 80-inch flat screen LED monitors flush mounted to the partition.

The communications control area is divided into a voice area and a data area. The voice area, located on the right side of the compartment, contains the radio operator&#x27;s console, the semi-automatic switchboard console, and the communication officer&#x27;s console. The data area, located on the left side of the area, contains the record communications console, record data supervisor&#x27;s console, high speed DATA/AUTODIN/AFSAT console, and LF/VLF control heads.

===Lower deck===
The forward lower equipment room contains the aircraft&#x27;s water supply tanks, 1200 kVA electrical power panels, step-down transformers, VLF transmitter, and SHF SATCOM equipment. An AC/DC powered hydraulic retractable airstair is located in the forward right side of the forward lower equipment area, installed for airplane entry and exit. In the event of an emergency, the airstair can be jettisoned. The aft lower lobe contains the maintenance console and mission specific equipment.

The lower trailing wire antenna (TWA) area contains the aircraft&#x27;s TWA reel—which is used by up to 13 communications links—the antenna operator&#x27;s station, as well as the antenna reel controls and indicators. Much attention has been given to hardening this area against EMP, especially as the TWA, essential for communicating with Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines, is particularly effective in picking up EMP.

The flight avionics area contains the aircraft systems power panels, flight avionics equipment, liquid oxygen converters, and storage for baggage and spare parts.

==Operational history==
The E-4 fleet was originally deployed in 1974, when it was termed National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP), often pronounced &quot;kneecap&quot;. The aircraft was to provide a survivable platform to conduct war operations in the event of a nuclear attack. Early in the E-4&#x27;s service, the media dubbed the aircraft as &quot;the doomsday planes&quot;. The E-4 was also capable of operating the &quot;Looking Glass&quot; missions of the Strategic Air Command (SAC).

The aircraft were originally stationed at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, so that the U.S. president and secretary of defense could access them quickly in the event of an emergency. The name &quot;Nightwatch&quot; originates from the richly detailed Rembrandt painting, &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, that depicts local townsfolk protecting a town. It was selected by the Squadron&#x27;s first commanding officer. Later, the aircraft were moved to Offutt Air Force Base where they would be safer from attack. Until 1994, one E-4B was stationed at Andrews Air Force Base at all times so the President could easily board it in times of world crisis.

The NEACP aircraft originally used the static call sign &quot;Silver Dollar&quot;. This call sign faded from use when daily call signs were put in use. The E-4B serves as the Secretary of Defense&#x27;s preferred means of transportation when traveling outside the U.S. The spacious interior and sophisticated communications capability provided by the aircraft allow the Secretary&#x27;s senior staff to work for the duration of the mission.

With the adoption of two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs, Air Force designation VC-25A, to serve as Air Force One in 1989, and the end of the Cold War, the need for NEACP diminished. In 1994, NEACP began to be known as NAOC, and it took on a new responsibility: ferrying Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) crews to natural disaster sites and serving as a temporary command post on the ground, until facilities could be built on site. No E-4B was employed during the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005, though one E-4B was used by FEMA following Hurricane Opal in 1995.
One E-4B is kept on alert at all times. The &quot;cocked&quot; or &quot;on alert&quot; E-4B is crewed 24 hours a day with the watch crew on board guarding all communications systems awaiting a launch order (klaxon launch). Those crew members not on watch would be in the alert barracks, gymnasium, or at other base facilities. The 24-hour alert status at Andrews AFB ended when President Clinton ordered the aircraft to remain at Offutt unless needed. Relief crews remain based at Andrews and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

===September 2001 to present===
On 11 September 2001, an aircraft closely resembling an E-4B was spotted and filmed orbiting the Washington, D.C. area by news outlets and civilians, after the attack on the Pentagon. In his book &quot;Black Ice&quot;, Dan Verton identifies this aircraft as an E-4B taking part in an operational exercise, and the exercise was canceled when the first plane struck the World Trade Center.

Air traffic control recordings and radar data indicate this E-4B call sign VENUS77 became airborne just before 9:44 am, circled north of the White House during its climb, and then tracked to the south of Washington, D.C., where it entered a holding pattern. In 2008, Brent Scowcroft explained that he was on this plane to go on an inspection tour to one unspecified nuclear weapons site, as chairman of a DoD team called &quot;End to End review&quot;.

In January 2006, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced a plan to retire the entire E-4B fleet starting in 2009. This was reduced to retiring one of the aircraft in February 2007. Rumsfeld&#x27;s successor, Robert Gates, reversed this decision in May 2007.

As of the 2015 federal budget there were no plans for retiring the E-4B. The E-4B airframe has a usable life of 115,000 hours and 30,000 cycles, which would be reached in 2039. The maintenance limiting point would occur sometime in the 2020s.

All four produced are operated by the U.S. Air Force, and are assigned to the 1st Airborne Command Control Squadron (1ACCS), of the 595th Command and Control Group at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Operations are coordinated by the United States Strategic Command.

When the President travels outside of North America using a VC-25A as Air Force One, an E-4B will deploy to a second airport in the vicinity of the President&#x27;s destination, to be readily available in the event of a world crisis or an emergency that renders the VC-25A unusable. When President Barack Obama visited Honolulu, Hawaii, an E-4B was often stationed 200 miles away at Hilo International Airport on Hawaii Island.

In June 2017, two of the aircraft were damaged by a tornado that struck Offutt AFB, having been struck by falling debris after the tornado damaged the hangar the aircraft were stationed in. They were out of service for eleven weeks while repairs took place. The E-4B aircraft have been based at the nearby Lincoln Air National Guard Base three times: in 2006, then 2019 during the Missouri flood, and 2021–22 subsequent runway replacement.

===Replacement===
In 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Air Force began developing a replacement for the E-4. The new platform is currently known as the Survivable Airborne Operations Center. This aircraft is to be developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation collaborating with Rolls Royce, based on the Boeing 747-8I.

==Operators==
* United States Air Force – Global Strike Command
** 595th Command and Control Group – Offutt AFB, Nebraska
*** 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron

==Variants==
;E-4A: Three aircraft produced (s/n 73-1676, 73-1677, and 74-0787), powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A (first two aircraft) or General Electric CF6-50E2 (third aircraft) turbofan engines. No bulge to house equipment on top of fuselage. These were later converted to E-4Bs.
;E-4B: One built (s/n 75-0125) and equipped with CF6-50E2 engines. Has nuclear electromagnetic pulse protection, nuclear and thermal effects shielding, advanced electronics, and a wide variety of communications equipment.

==Specifications (E-4B)==
==Notable appearances in media==
The E-4B plays a prominent role in two motion pictures. In the 1990 HBO film &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;, following a nuclear strike by the Soviets, the aircraft serves as a flying platform for the presumed president, the ex–Secretary of the Interior, who is played by Darren McGavin. The aircraft is pursued by a Boeing EC-135 &quot;Looking Glass&quot;, which successfully intercepts it. 

In the 2002 motion picture &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, the president and his staff travel on an E-4B, following the detonation of a nuclear weapon by terrorists. In the novel, the Vice President and his family are aboard the NEACP after terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in Denver, while the President and his National Security Advisor are stuck at Camp David during a blinding snowstorm.

National Geographic produced a television special on doomsday planning of the U.S., which includes footage from inside an E-4B during a drill.

<doc id="440904" wikidata="Q40177" url="?curid=440904" title="Sonic &amp; Knuckles">
<text>is a 1994 platform game developed by Sega Technical Institute and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog or Knuckles the Echidna in their quests to save Angel Island; Sonic tries to stop Doctor Robotnik from re-launching his orbital weapon, the Death Egg, while Knuckles scuffles with Robotnik&#x27;s minion, EggRobo. Like previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, players traverse side-scrolling levels at high speeds while collecting rings and defeating enemies.

Sega Technical Institute developed &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; simultaneously alongside its predecessor, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994); they were planned as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; cartridge features an adapter that allows players to connect the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; cartridge, creating a combined game, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992) can also be attached, allowing players to control Knuckles in &quot;Sonic 2&quot; stages. Attaching the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; or any other Genesis game released prior to this will unlock the &quot;Blue Sphere&quot; minigame.

&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; was released for the Sega Genesis on October 18, 1994. It received positive reviews; critics were impressed with the replay value and lock-on technology, despite its similarity to &quot;Sonic 3&quot;. The games sold a combined four million copies worldwide, placing them among the best-selling Sega Genesis games. They have since been rereleased in various Sega and &quot;Sonic&quot; compilations.

==Gameplay==
Since &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; were initially developed as one game, their gameplay is similar: both are 2D side-scrolling platformers with similar level design, graphics, and game mechanics. However, in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, unlike in &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, the player chooses either Sonic or Knuckles at the title screen, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower is not available to select, and the player cannot control two characters together. There is also no multiplayer mode or save feature.

The player character moves through six levels, each divided into two acts. The first act of each level ends with a miniboss fight with one of Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s robots, while the second ends with a regular boss fight with Robotnik (or EggRobo in Knuckles&#x27; campaign). Sonic and Knuckles traverse levels differently; Sonic can jump higher and has access to unique shield abilities, whereas Knuckles can glide and climb most walls. The levels also include cutscenes that differ based on the character selected, as Sonic and Knuckles are opponents for most of the game.

The game contains two types of bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves bouncing around a room with a slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.

Special Stages are entered by finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player is placed in a 3D environment and must turn all of a number of blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones. Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on them make the player walk backward in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into Super Sonic or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.

===Lock-on technology===


&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; features &quot;lock-on technology&quot; that allows players to open the hatch on the cartridge and insert a second cartridge. When &quot;Sonic 3&quot; is inserted, the player can play through both games as one, &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;. This features several changes to the games, such as slightly altered level layouts, the ability to play through &quot;Sonic 3&quot; levels as Knuckles or &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; levels as Tails, and the ability to save progress in &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; levels. Additionally, combining the cartridges is the only way to collect &quot;Super Emeralds&quot;, earned by accessing Special Stages in the &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; levels after collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds from &quot;Sonic 3&quot;. When all Super Emeralds have been collected, Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails can transform into Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Super Tails, each with unique abilities.

Inserting &quot;Sonic 2&quot; unlocks &quot;Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, wherein the player can play &quot;Sonic 2&quot; using Knuckles&#x27; abilities. If the player attaches any other Genesis game released prior to &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, a screen with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik stating &quot;No Way!&quot; is displayed. From here, the player can also access a minigame based on &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; Chaos Emerald Special Stages. The attached cartridge determines the Special Stage layout. If the player attaches the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, they are able to access all of the possible variations of the special stages, each with a unique level number and corresponding password. This game is named &quot;Blue Sphere&quot; in &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; and &quot;Blue Spheres&quot; in &quot;Sonic Origins&quot;.

==Plot==
After the events of &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s orbital weapon, the Death Egg, crash-lands on Angel Island. Sonic travels to Angel Island to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles, only to discover Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island&#x27;s levitation powers. Knuckles attacks Robotnik, but Robotnik shocks him with electricity. Knuckles shows Sonic a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic infiltrates the Death Egg and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic, retrieving the Master Emerald and returning it to Angel Island as it rises back into the sky.

In Knuckles&#x27; story, taking place after Sonic&#x27;s, Knuckles is attacked by EggRobo, one of Robotnik&#x27;s robots. He chases him to the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles, but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic&#x27;s and fights Knuckles until the latter eventually defeats the mecha. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane &quot;Tornado&quot;, and takes Knuckles and the Master Emerald back to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Angel Island plummets into the ocean.

==Development==

&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; was developed in California by the Japanese members of Sega Technical Institute (STI). &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; were originally planned as a single game; according to designer Takashi Iizuka, the team &quot;really wanted to hit a home run&quot;, with larger stages that took longer to develop. As ROM cartridges were too small to contain the game and Sega wanted it released in time for a promotional deal with McDonald&#x27;s in the US, &quot;Sonic 3&quot; was split in two, with &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; as the second part. As Mushroom Hill became the first stage of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, the developers lowered its difficulty.

Despite the split, the developers wanted the games to feel like a single experience. According to Roger Hector, vice president and general manager of STI, the lock-on technology was conceived between the releases of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992).

The team explained their situation to Sega&#x27;s hardware division, which gave them the lock-on adapter. The team knew that players would likely use the adapter to insert games beside &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, so they implemented the &quot;Blue Sphere&quot; minigame for most games. They made Knuckles playable in &quot;Sonic 2&quot; if that game was inserted because the team found his play style suited its levels. They considered including the same functionality for the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, but the developers felt Knuckles&#x27; abilities did not work with its level design.

==Release==
&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; was released on October 18, 1994. It was released around the same time as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; for the Genesis&#x27;s competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Industry figures called the coinciding releases a &quot;battle&quot; as both advertised &quot;revolutionary&quot; technological advances: lock-on technology for &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; and 3D-rendered graphics for &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; was backed by a $45 million marketing campaign; at the time, video games typically had a marketing budget of $5 million. Blockbuster Video and MTV co-sponsored a tournament in which children were allowed to play &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;. The final tournament was held at Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, California, with a prize of $25,000 and the title &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Hardcore Gamer&quot;. Two finalists were also awarded a copy of every Sega product released for the next year. MTV broadcast the tournament finale along with footage of the game as &quot;MTV&#x27;s Rock the Rock&quot;.

==Rereleases==

&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; has been released as part of numerous compilations of Sega games including &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; (1997) for the Sega Saturn; &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles Collection&quot; (1997) and &quot;Sonic &amp; Garfield Pack&quot; (1999) for the PC, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; (2002) for the GameCube; &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; (2004) for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC; &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; and &quot;Sonic Classic Collection&quot; (2010) for the Nintendo DS.

&quot;Sonic Jam&quot;, in addition to featuring the original release, included some new &quot;remix&quot; options to modify the game: &quot;Normal&quot; mode alters the layout of rings and hazards and &quot;Easy&quot; mode removes certain acts entirely from the game. The version in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; does not retain the lock-on feature included in other versions of the game, because of &quot;tight development times&quot;.

The game has been re-released through the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console and Xbox 360&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade. Both releases are programmed such that, if any of the &quot;Lock-on&quot; games are also downloaded on the same account, the &quot;connected&quot; versions of the game are also available. For example, if one downloads &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; and &quot;Sonic 2&quot;, they have the option to play the corresponding &quot;Knuckles in Sonic 2&quot; game. When the PC version was released via the Steam software, the games were released together as &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; as originally intended, with the player (even if playing as Tails) simply continuing at the beginning of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; after finishing &quot;Sonic 3&quot;.

&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; is included in the retro console &quot;Sega Genesis Flashback&quot; released in 2017 by AtGames, a compilation of 45 Genesis games that does not have &quot;Sonic 3&quot;. 

&quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; was re-released for the first time since 2011 as part of the &quot;Sonic Origins&quot; compilation in 2022. All versions of the games included in &quot;Origins&quot; are remasters running on the Retro Engine, with &quot;Sonic 1, 2&quot; and &quot;CD&quot; being new ports of existing remasters. This version of the title was developed by Simon Thomley of Headcannon, who previously worked on both &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; and the other titles included. The &quot;Origins&quot; version features the original &quot;Blue Sphere&quot; minigame as a bonus mode, as well as new iteration of the mode called &quot;New Blue Spheres&quot; which includes the additional sphere colors introduced in &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;.

==Reception==
The Genesis version sold at least 1.24 million copies in the United States. &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; sold a combined cartridges worldwide.

Critics praised &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, despite its similarity to its predecessor. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named it their &quot;Game of the Month&quot;. They lauded the lock-on technology and remarked that despite that being &quot;more of the same, it still is an exceptional game&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the ability to play as Knuckles makes it essentially two games on a single cartridge, the game is more challenging than &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, and the ability to hook the cartridge up to &quot;Sonic 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; makes those games &quot;worth playing again&quot;. They gave it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor). &quot;Next Generation&quot; remarked, &quot;Basically, this is the same &quot;Sonic&quot; game that Sega has sold for the last three years, just wrapped up better and with a prettier ribbon.&quot;

Critics praised the lock-on technology the game offered. Lucas Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; said it was &quot;a great game on its own&quot;, but the lock-on feature completely revamped the overall experience. Dan Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; preferred &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; to &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, stating that he could not fully appreciate its predecessor without its &quot;companion piece&quot;. &quot;Sega Power&quot; review praised the game&#x27;s harder difficulty in comparison to its predecessor and the new expansion of levels, admitting that the expansion would not have been possible had &quot;Sonic 3&quot; been a single game. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; review similarly praised the lock-on technology and the new innovation the unique cartridge offered, adding that &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;″ hidden stages and bosses would strongly add to the replay value of the combined game.

Reviewing the Virtual Console release, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; writer James Newton praised its support for the old lock-on feature of the original release, claiming that the game does not truly shine without having purchased &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; to activate this feature. Thomas praised the game for &quot;impressive visuals that pushed the Genesis to its limits&quot; and for the value added in the content unlocked with the lock-on technology.

==Legacy==
For the series&#x27; twentieth anniversary in 2011, Sega released &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, a game that remade aspects of various past games from the franchise. A remake of the Sky Sanctuary stage was made for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game, while the Mushroom Hill level was remade for the Nintendo 3DS version of the game. &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; features a track inspired by the Death Egg as downloadable content along with the Metal Sonic character. The sequel, &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, featured the same race course, and an additional new one inspired by the Sky Sanctuary stage. Re-imagined versions of the Flying Battery and Lava Reef stages, along with the Blue Sphere bonus game, appear in the 2017 game &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; draws inspiration from &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, though it is not a direct adaptation. 

In 2022, 30 years after the release of the game, Paramount announced the release of the film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; in December 2024, as well as the release of &quot;Knuckles&quot; on Paramount+ in April of that year; the creative team behind the live-action franchise confirmed this was meant to be an homage to the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;/&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; double-feature.

<doc id="440906" wikidata="Q221076" url="?curid=440906" title="Seiche">
<text>A seiche ( ) is a standing wave in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water. Seiches and seiche-related phenomena have been observed on lakes, reservoirs, swimming pools, bays, harbors, caves, and seas. The key requirement for formation of a seiche is that the body of water be at least partially bounded, allowing the formation of the standing wave.

The term was promoted by the Swiss hydrologist François-Alphonse Forel in 1890, who was the first to make scientific observations of the effect in Lake Geneva. The word had apparently long been used in the region to describe oscillations in alpine lakes. According to Wilson (1972), this Swiss French dialect word comes from the Latin word meaning &quot;dry&quot;, i.e., as the water recedes, the beach dries. The French word or (dry) descends from the Latin.

Seiches in harbours can be caused by &quot;long-period&quot; or &quot;infragravity waves&quot;, which are due to subharmonic nonlinear wave interaction with the wind waves, having periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.
==Causes and nature==
Seiches are often imperceptible to the naked eye, and observers in boats on the surface may not notice that a seiche is occurring due to the extremely long periods.

The effect is caused by resonances in a body of water that has been disturbed by one or more factors, most often meteorological effects (wind and atmospheric pressure variations), seismic activity, or tsunamis. Gravity always seeks to restore the horizontal surface of a body of liquid water, as this represents the configuration in which the water is in hydrostatic equilibrium.

Vertical harmonic motion results, producing an impulse that travels the length of the basin at a velocity that depends on the depth of the water. The impulse is reflected back from the end of the basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce standing waves with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no vertical motion. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature.

The longest natural period of a seiche is the period associated with the fundamental resonance for the body of water—corresponding to the longest standing wave. For a surface seiche in an enclosed rectangular body of water this can be estimated using Merian&#x27;s formula:

: formula_1

where &quot;T&quot; is the longest natural period, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are the length and average depth of the body of water, and &quot;g&quot; the acceleration of gravity.

Higher-order harmonics are also observed. The period of the second harmonic will be half the natural period, the period of the third harmonic will be a third of the natural period, and so forth.

==Occurrence==
Seiches have been observed on both lakes and seas. The key requirement is that the body of water be partially constrained to allow formation of standing waves. Regularity of geometry is not required; even harbours with exceedingly irregular shapes are routinely observed to oscillate with very stable frequencies.

===Lake seiches===
Low rhythmic seiches are almost always present on larger lakes. They are usually unnoticeable among the common wave patterns, except during periods of unusual calm. Harbours, bays, and estuaries are often prone to small seiches with amplitudes of a few centimetres and periods of a few minutes.

The original studies in Lake Geneva by François-Alphonse Forel found the longitudinal period to have a 73-minute cycle, and the transversal seiche to have a period of around 10 minutes. Another lake well known for its regular seiches is New Zealand&#x27;s Lake Wakatipu, which varies its surface height at Queenstown by 20 centimetres in a 27-minute cycle. Seiches can also form in semi-enclosed seas; the North Sea often experiences a lengthwise seiche with a period of about 36 hours.
The National Weather Service issues low water advisories for portions of the Great Lakes when seiches of or greater are likely to occur. Lake Erie is particularly prone to wind-caused seiches because of its shallowness and its elongation on a northeast–southwest axis, which frequently matches the direction of prevailing winds and therefore maximises the fetch of those winds. These can lead to extreme seiches of up to between the ends of the lake.

The effect is similar to a storm surge like that caused by hurricanes along ocean coasts, but the seiche effect can cause oscillation back and forth across the lake for some time. In 1954, the remnants of Hurricane Hazel piled up water along the northwestern Lake Ontario shoreline near Toronto, causing extensive flooding, and established a seiche that subsequently caused flooding along the south shore.

Lake seiches can occur very quickly: on July 13, 1995, a large seiche on Lake Superior caused the water level to fall and then rise again by one metre (three feet) within fifteen minutes, leaving some boats hanging from the docks on their mooring lines when the water retreated. The same storm system that caused the 1995 seiche on Lake Superior produced a similar effect in Lake Huron, in which the water level at Port Huron changed by over two hours. On June 26, 1954, on Lake Michigan in Chicago, eight fishermen were swept away from piers at Montrose and North Avenue Beaches and drowned when a seiche hit the Chicago waterfront.

Lakes in seismically active areas, such as Lake Tahoe in California/Nevada, are significantly at risk from seiches. Geological evidence indicates that the shores of Lake Tahoe may have been hit by seiches and tsunamis as much as high in prehistoric times, and local researchers have called for the risk to be factored into emergency plans for the region.

Earthquake-generated seiches can be observed thousands of miles away from the epicentre of a quake. Swimming pools are especially prone to seiches caused by earthquakes, as the ground tremors often match the resonant frequencies of small bodies of water. The 1994 Northridge earthquake in California caused swimming pools to overflow across southern California. The massive Good Friday earthquake that hit Alaska in 1964 caused seiches in swimming pools as far away as Puerto Rico. The earthquake that hit Lisbon, Portugal in 1755 also caused seiches farther north in Loch Lomond, Loch Long, Loch Katrine and Loch Ness in Scotland, and in canals in Sweden. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake caused seiches in standing water bodies in many Indian states as well as in Bangladesh, Nepal, and northern Thailand. Seiches were again observed in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal in India as well as in many locations in Bangladesh during the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.

The 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake is known to have generated seiches as far away as Norway and southern England. Other earthquakes in the Indian sub-continent known to have generated seiches include the 1803 Kumaon-Barahat, 1819 Allah Bund, 1842 Central Bengal, 1905 Kangra, 1930 Dhubri, 1934 Nepal-Bihar, 2001 Bhuj, 2005 Nias, 2005 Teresa Island earthquakes. The February 27, 2010 Chile earthquake produced a seiche on Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, with a height of around . The 2010 Baja California earthquake produced large seiches that quickly became an internet phenomenon.

Seiches up to at least 1.8 m (6 feet) were observed in Sognefjorden, Norway, during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan.

===Sea and bay seiches===
Seiches have been observed in seas such as the Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea. This results in the flooding of Venice and Saint Petersburg, respectively, as both cities are constructed on former marshland. In St. Petersburg, seiche-induced flooding is common along the Neva River in the autumn. The seiche is driven by a low-pressure region in the North Atlantic moving onshore, giving rise to cyclonic lows on the Baltic Sea. The low pressure of the cyclone draws greater-than-normal quantities of water into the virtually landlocked Baltic. As the cyclone continues inland, long, low-frequency seiche waves with wavelengths up to several hundred kilometres are established in the Baltic. When the waves reach the narrow and shallow Neva Bay, they become much higher—ultimately flooding the Neva embankments. Similar phenomena are observed at Venice, resulting in the MOSE Project, a system of 79 mobile barriers designed to protect the three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon.

In Japan, seiches have been observed in Nagasaki Bay, most often in the spring. During a seiche event on 31 March 1979, a water-level displacement of was recorded at Nagasaki tide station; the maximum displacement in the whole bay is thought to have reached as much as . Seiches in Western Kyushu—including Nagasaki Bay—are often induced by a low in the atmospheric pressure passing South of Kyushu island. Seiches in Nagasaki Bay have a period of about 30 to 40 minutes. Locally, seiches have caused floods, destroyed port facilities and damaged the fishery: hence the local word for seiche, , from , meaning &#x27;the dragging-away of a fishing net&#x27;.

On occasion, tsunamis can produce seiches as a result of local geographic peculiarities. For instance, the tsunami that hit Hawaii in 1946 had a fifteen-minute interval between wave fronts. The natural resonant period of Hilo Bay is about thirty minutes. That meant that every second wave was in phase with the bay, creating a seiche. As a result, Hilo suffered worse damage than any other place in Hawaii, with the combined tsunami and seiche reaching a height of along the Bayfront, killing 96 people in the city alone. Seiche waves may continue for several days after a tsunami.

Tide-generated internal solitary waves (solitons) can excite coastal seiches at the following locations: Magueyes Island in Puerto Rico,
Puerto Princesa in Palawan Island,
Trincomalee Bay in Sri Lanka,
and in the Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada, where seiches cause some of the highest recorded tidal fluctuations in the world.
A dynamical mechanism exists for the generation of coastal seiches by deep-sea internal waves. These waves can generate a sufficient current at the shelf break to excite coastal seiches.

In September 2023, an enormous landslide resulting from a melting glacier near Dickson Fjord in Greenland triggered a megatsunami about high. This was followed by a seiche with waves up to high oscillating within the fjord. This seiche lasted nine days, reflecting the avalanche&#x27;s large size and the fjord&#x27;s long, narrow shape. During that period, it generated unusual seismic reverberations detected around the world, puzzling seismologists for some time before they could identify their source.

===Underwater (internal) waves===
Seiches are also observed beneath the surface of constrained bodies of water, acting along the thermocline.

In analogy with the Merian formula, the expected period of the internal wave can be expressed as:

: formula_2 with formula_3

where &quot;T&quot; is the natural period, &quot;L&quot; is the length of the water body, formula_4 the average thicknesses of the two layers separated by stratification (e.g. epilimnion and hypolimnion), formula_5 the densities of these two same layers and &quot;g&quot; the acceleration of gravity.

As the thermocline moves up and down a sloping lake bed, it creates a &#x27;swash zone&#x27;, where temperatures can vary rapidly, potentially affecting fish habitat. As the thermocline rises up a sloping lake bed, it can also cause benthic turbulence by convective overturning, whereas the falling thermocline experiences greater stratification and low turbulence at the lake bed. Internal waves can also degenerate into non-linear internal waves on sloping lake-beds. When such non-linear waves break on the lake bed, they can be an important source of turbulence and have the potential for sediment resuspension

===Cave seiches===
On September 19, 2022, a seiche reaching occurred at Devils Hole at Death Valley National Park in the U.S. after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit western Mexico, about away. Seiches were also observed in the cave after powerful earthquakes in 2012, 2018 and 2019.

==Engineering for seiche protection==
Engineers consider seiche phenomena in the design of flood protection works (e.g., Saint Petersburg Dam), reservoirs and dams (e.g., Grand Coulee Dam), potable water storage basins, harbours, and even spent nuclear fuel storage basins. Structures and beach-dune systems are particularly vulnerable to damage from high water levels. Wetlands may be severely affected even by small fluctuations in water levels, and therefore historical and predicted water level fluctuations are crucial data for any coastal design. Information on seiches, along with storm surges, and tidal fluctuations is essential.

The period of a seiche depends on the size and depth of the basin in which it occurs. If an incoming wave train has a period similar to the natural frequency of the harbour, each wave will amplify the seiche&#x27;s intensity, resulting in rougher waters within the harbour compared to the surrounding sea, which can create problems for shipping. The levels of high water in Venice for example, are the result of a combination of storm surge, barometric surge and seiches.

<text>The Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (PCCNA) is an interdenominational fellowship of Pentecostal and charismatic churches and denominations in North America, existing for the purpose of promoting cooperation and understanding. It is a successor to the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America (PFNA). PCCNA headquarters are in Los Angeles, California.

==History==

===Pentecostal Fellowship of North America===
The Pentecostal Fellowship of North America was formed by eight Pentecostal denominations in 1948 at Des Moines, Iowa. Before the Des Moines meeting, a rally was held in Washington, D.C., and plans for a constitution were formulated. Two of the leading figures of the Washington meeting were Bishop Joseph A. Synan and Oral Roberts.

The following were charter members of the PFNA:
*Assemblies of God USA
*Church of God (Cleveland)
*International Church of the Foursquare Gospel
*International Pentecostal Holiness Church
*Open Bible Standard Churches

===Racial reconciliation and inclusion of charismatics===
The Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America was formed as part of a unification of charismatic and Pentecostal bodies and a movement toward racial reconciliation. Whereas the PFNA was formed to help bridge doctrinal divisions, the PCCNA set a broader goal of also the racial and cultural gaps. At a meeting in 1994 in Memphis, Tennessee, the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America was dissolved, and the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America was formed.

&quot;We are gathered here in Memphis, Tennessee, to return to our roots and to recapture the initiative of the Spirit. This will be a time of repentance for the sins of the past. This will be a time of forgiveness as we rely upon the wonderful grace of our loving Heavenly Father and mirror that grace in our relationships with one another. The time has come for reconciliation! The time has come to recapture our heritage! We gather here as the children of God and heirs of the twentieth century Pentecostal/charismatic renewal of the church. Our Father has called us to unity.&quot; - from an address of Bishop B. E. Underwood, Chairman of the PFNA, October, 1994

==Purposes==
#To relate to one another as members of the body of Christ.
#To demonstrate the essential unity of Spirit-filled believers in answer to the prayer of Jesus in John 17:21, “That they all may be one.”
#To foster the evangelization of the world through the preaching of the gospel, with signs and wonders and the demonstration of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, by presenting Jesus Christ as the only Savior, Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Coming King. (Mark 16:10-20)
#To promote and encourage the Pentecostal/Charismatic revival and renewal in North America and throughout the world.
#To serve as a forum of spiritual unity, dialogue, and fellowship for all Pentecostal and Charismatic believers in North America, crossing all cultural and racial lines based on mutual equality, love, respect, and sound doctrine. (Acts 2:42)
#To preserve mutual love and respect for each member group, maintaining “the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” (Ephesians 4:1)

===Recent Dialogue===
As of 2023, the PCCNA has been in ecumenical discussion with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), as well as discussing the possibility of future theological dialogue between Pentecostalism and Catholicism.

In April of 2024, the PCCNA sent several delegates to the World Christian Forum in Ghana to represent Pentecostalism.

The PCCNA is also involved with the Somos Um (We are One) initiative in Brazil, which seeks to unite Brazilian Catholics, Evangelicals and Pentecostals. 

==Members==
With 48 denominations and associations as members, the PCCNA merges tens of millions of Christians in North America. Besides for Church networks and Denominations, the PCCNA also has the Wesleyan Holiness Connection, a separate association of 17 denominations, as a member. Several denominations are found in both associations and have dual membership. The below membership statistics are only for congregants in North America and are not indicative of total denominational or church network statistics.

<text>Fractint (originally FRACT386) is a freeware computer program to render and display many kinds of fractals. The program originated on MS-DOS, then was ported to the Atari ST, Linux, and Macintosh. During the early 1990s, Fractint was the definitive fractal generating program for personal computers.

The name is a portmanteau of &quot;fractal&quot; and &quot;integer&quot;, since the first versions of Fractint used only integer arithmetic (also known as fixed-point arithmetic), for faster rendering on computers without math coprocessors. Since then, floating-point arithmetic and arbitrary-precision arithmetic modes have been added.

FractInt can draw most kinds of fractals that have appeared in the literature. It also has a few &quot;fractal types&quot; that are not strictly speaking fractals, but may be more accurately described as display hacks. These include cellular automata.

==Development==

Fractint originally appeared in 1988 as FRACT386, a computer program for rendering fractals very quickly on the Intel 80386 processor using integer arithmetic. The 80386 requires the Intel 80387 coprocessor to natively support floating point math, which was rare in IBM PC compatibles.

Early versions of FRACT386 were written by Bert Tyler, who based it on a Mandelbrot generator for a TI-based processor that used integer math and decided to try programming something similar for his 386 machine.

In February 1989, the program was renamed Fractint. In July 1990, it was ported to the Atari ST, with the math routines rewritten in Motorola 68000 assembly language by Howard Chu.

==Forks==
There are two notable forks of FRACTINT: ManPWin and Iterated Dynamics. ManPWin is a fork based on WinFract 18 with source code on github. Iterated Dynamics is a fork based on FRACTINT 20.04 patch level 4, with source code on github.

<text>Mount Parnitha (, , Katharevousa and &quot;Parnis&quot;/&quot;Parnes&quot;; sometimes Parnetha) is a lightly forested mountain range north of Athens, the highest on the peninsula of Attica, with an elevation of 1,413 m, and a summit known as Karavola (Καραβόλα). Much of the mountain is designated a national park, and is a protected habitat for wildfowl, first created in 1961. The summit is located 18 km north of Acharnes and about 30 km north of the Athens city center. The mountain covers approximately 250 km² of land. Other peaks include Mavrovouni (Μαυροβούνι), Ornio (1,350 m), Area (1,160 m), Avgo or Avgho (1,150 m), and Xerovouni (Ξεροβούνι, meaning &quot;dry mountain&quot;: 1,120 m). It also has two shelters Mpafi and Flampouri. The name of the mountain dates back to ancient times, when it was under the ancient demes of Acharnae and Decelea.

== Geography ==
Towns surrounding the mountain include Aspropyrgos, Fyli, Acharnes, Varymbombi, Thrakomakedones, Dekeleia, Avlona and Agios Stefanos as well as the settlement of Agios Merkourios. The highway GR-1 (E75) surrounds the northern and eastern part of the mountain along with the Cephissus river, while the Attiki Odos motorway (GR-6) runs to its south. The mountain offers panoramic views of the mountains northeast of Parnitha, Penteli to the east, the Hymettus to the southeast, the Aigaleo to the south and another to the west; from its summit, one can also see the Thriasian Plain, the Saronic Gulf including the islands of Salamina, Aigina and the North, the South Euboean Gulfs and island of Euboea, and most of central and northern Greater Athens. The view during clear days can extend to northern Boeotia and the Peloponnese.

===Climate===
Parnitha mountain has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) with frequent snowfalls in winter and pleasant temperatures in summer. The mountain is significantly wetter than areas of east and southern Attica.
The mountain was also affected by several major blizzards, including two in 2005 and 2006, stranding cars and closing roads, as well as the cable car.

==Ecology==
Forests of Aleppo Pine cover all slopes beneath 1,000 m altitude, and are often threatened by forest fires, such as happened in 2005, 2007, 2021 and 2023. Above 1,000 m it is covered principally in Greek Fir, grasses and shrubbery, and beneath 300 m mainly farmlands and suburban housing to the east. About 1,000 species of plants can be found on the mountain, including crocus and tulips, and the mountain also provides a native habitat to its red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), which were known in ancient times. After the traumatic fire in 2007 (&quot;see below&quot;), they are even scarcer. Several large mines lie to the northwest, and the ore from them was shipped to a nearby factory in industrial areas. Further forest fires occurred in the summers of 2021 and 2023 leaving only northern parts of the mountain forest unburned.

==Historical monuments and places of interest==

Parnitha has several places of archaeological interest. In antiquity, several fortresses had been built on the mountain, for the defense of the peninsula of Attica and more specifically Classical Athens against the Boeotians and others enemies from the north. Today some fortresses are kept in good condition such as the Phyle fortress, at a height of 687 meters in the west of Parnitha. Other notable fortresses are the Panakton, in the area of Dervenochoria and Eleutherae fortress near Mount Cithaeron. Dekeleia was also an important fortress on the site of modern-day former royal palace in Tatoi, and the fort of Limiko was situated deep inside the mountain, just north of its peak. 

A notable monument of later periods is the Monastery of Kleiston. It is a Byzantine monastery dated from 13th century. It is mentioned by Pope Innocent IV in 1209 with the name Monastery of Kyras. Southeast of Parnitha, in a dense forest, is Tatoi Palace. It was the palace of the Greek royal family and it was built in 19th century. Today it is abandoned.
Parnitha has also natural monuments. The cave of Panas is on the west slopes of the mountain at a height of 750 meters. It was a worship site in antiquity. Near the cave there is the steep gorge of Gouras and the gorge of Keladonas river. A beautiful site of the mountain is Beletsi Lake, on the east slopes of the mountain, near Afidnes, and it is important place for migratory birds. In general, the national park is known as the &quot;lungs of Athens&quot;.

==Modern facilities==
A casino, the Regency Casino Mont Parnes, is located near the top of the mountain and is served by a suspended cable car. Two shelters are also on Parnitha, the most known of which is Mpafi. A series of trails are found around the mountain as well as forest roads, and also on the mountain is Athens&#x27; second transmitter, broadcasting radio and television since the mid-1950s, across the range of television channels from ERT, ANT1, Mega, Alter and more, to satellite, including Super Sport, Seven X and Filmnet, and a multitude of radio including ERA Radio, Klik FM, ANT1 Radio, Ciao FM, Rhythmos, Super Sport FM, Top FM and others. The supporting road connection was paved in the mid-20th century.

== 2007 wildfire ==

Parnitha suffered extensive damage from a wildfire on Thursday, 28 June 2007 around the morning and noon hours, continuing for several days and burning approximately 56 km² of land; one of the worst recorded wildfires in the prefecture after that of Penteli. The magnitude of the devastation was unforeseen. A smaller fire had, however, taken place in the 1960s.

The fire consumed dozens of acres of forest across two prefectures. Firefighters, helicopters, and planes were brought into action across the mountain area and its edges fighting the enormous blaze, which took days to contain. It spread rapidly with the help of intense winds, and intensified into the northwestern edges of Greater Athens, including both Ano Liosia and towns and villages such as Fyli, near Thrakomakedones, Pyli and both Skoura and Schimatari north of the mountain. From Athens, inhabitants could see the mountainside burning throughout the night. In Schimatari in Boeotia, it ruined several acres of forest and businesses. The fire claimed 80% of the rare Greek Fir and Aleppo Pine forest, 150 animals of the red deer population (an endangered species), birds, and other rare animals. The remains of the green firs and pines are scattered around its edges. The smoke from the massive destruction formed a line that traveled east over Attica, southern Euboea, Chios, to the edge of Turkey, approximately 350 km away.

On June 30, the fire was mostly contained and warnings of new fires were reduced, as only a few fires were slowly burning sporadically in separate parts of the mountain. The main blaze was completely put out on July 1. At the edges of the burnt parts, several fires slowly continued to burn in sections after June 30, with a slow expansion.

Scientists estimate that the area&#x27;s recovery time may be as long as a century. They predict the effect of the loss will only begin to be felt in the coming years; the air may become a little stale and the already known problems of air pollution and smog in Athens may reappear and intensify. Temperatures could also rise and flooding may become a problem for several years. The Ministry of Environment is currently considering a conclusive reforestation program, while many citizens marched on the streets of Athens to express their disapproval of the handling of the situation. More recently, reforestation has been underway, and the government will be receiving tens of thousands of trees to be planted around the mountains, most of them from outside the country, albeit at a small scale thus far.

Investigations are still underway as to the fire&#x27;s cause. One scenario suggests a transformer belonging to a major power line exploded due to overuse and overheating by the 47C heatwave, some days before the fire. Another holds that this was one of the many arson attacks that have claimed forested land in Greece over recent decades to illegally clear formerly-protected land for expanded real estate.

<doc id="440930" wikidata="Q474046" url="?curid=440930" title="Amorality">
<text>Amorality (also known as amoralism) is an absence of, indifference towards, disregard for, or incapacity for morality. Some simply refer to it as a case of being neither moral nor immoral. Amoral should not be confused with &quot;immoral&quot;, which refers to an agent doing or thinking something they know or believe to be wrong.

Morality and amorality in humans and other animals is a subject of dispute among scientists and philosophers. If morality is intrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings either do not exist or are only deficiently human, a condition sometimes described as moral idiocy or anti-social behavior disorder. On the other hand, if morality is extrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings can both exist and be fully human, and as such be amoral by default. Human capabilities may be thought of as amoral in that they can be used for either constructive or destructive purposes, i.e., for good or for ill.

There is a position which claims that amorality is just another form of morality or a concept that is close to it, citing moral naturalism, moral constructivism, moral relativism, and moral fictionalism as constructs that resemble key aspects of amorality.

== Inanimate objects ==
One may consider any entity that is not amoral. For example, a rock may be used (by rational agents) for good or bad purposes, but the rock itself is neither good nor bad. In ontological philosophy, the ancient gnostic concept that the material world was inherently evil applied morality to existence itself and was a point of concern in early Christianity in the form of Docetism, as it opposed the notion that creation is good, as stated in The Book of Genesis. In modern science, however, the matter of the universe is often observed amorally for objective purposes.

== Legal entities ==
Corporations are thought by some to be amoral entities. This can refer to the &quot;ethical numbness&quot; of these organizations&#x27; executives and managers, especially when approached from the view that corporations can be considered moral agents as well as a kind of legal person.

<doc id="440936" wikidata="Q600751" url="?curid=440936" title="Prosecutor">
<text>A prosecutor is a legal representative of the prosecution in states with either the adversarial system, which is adopted in common law, or inquisitorial system, which is adopted in civil law. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against the defendant, an individual accused of breaking the law. Typically, the prosecutor represents the state or the government in the case brought against the accused person.

== Prosecutor as a legal professional ==
Prosecutors are typically lawyers who possess a law degree and are recognised as suitable legal professionals by the court in which they are acting. This may mean they have been admitted to the bar or obtained a comparable qualification where available, such as solicitor advocates in England law. They become involved in a criminal case once a suspect has been identified and charges need to be filed. They are employed by an office of the government, with safeguards in place to ensure such an office can successfully pursue the prosecution of government officials. Multiple offices exist in a single country, especially in those countries with federal governments where sovereignty has been bifurcated or devolved in some way.

Since the power of the state backs prosecutors, they are subject to special professional responsibility rules in addition to those binding all lawyers. For example, in the United States, Rule 3.8 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct requires prosecutors to &quot;make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense.&quot; Not all U.S. states adopt the model rules; however, U.S. Supreme Court cases and other appellate cases have ruled that such disclosure is required. Typical sources of ethical requirements imposed on prosecutors come from appellate court opinions, state or federal court rules, and state or federal statutes (codified laws).

===Directors of public prosecutions===
In most Commonwealth Nations, the head of the prosecuting authority is known as the director of public prosecutions (DPP) and is appointed, not elected. A DPP may be subject to varying degrees of control by the attorney general, a formal written directive which must be published.

In Australia, the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions institute prosecutions for indictable offences on behalf of the Crown. At least in the case of very serious matters, the DPP will be asked by the police, during the investigation, to advise them on the sufficiency of evidence and may well be asked to prepare an application to the relevant court for search, listening device or telecommunications interception warrants.

More recent constitutions, such as South Africa&#x27;s, guarantee the independence and impartiality of the DPP.

==Common law jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Prosecutors in Australia come in a few distinct species. Prosecutors of minor criminal cases in lower courts are police sergeants with a traineeship in prosecution and advocacy lasting approximately one year in duration, although they may hold law degrees. Crown Prosecutors are always lawyers and typically barristers, and they represent the state or Commonwealth in serious criminal cases in higher courts, County Court and above. Aside from police prosecutors and Crown prosecutors, government agencies have the authority to appoint non-lawyers to prosecute on their behalf, such as the RSPCA Inspectors.

===Canada===
In Canada, public prosecutors in most provinces are called Crown Attorney or Crown Counsel. They are generally appointed by the provincial Attorney General.

=== England and Wales ===
The prosecution landscape in England and Wales is highly varied, meaning that a prosecutor can refer to a number of different individuals and roles.

==== Types of prosecutor ====
The primary prosecutor in the jurisdiction is the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which is led by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The CPS prosecutes on behalf of the Crown and also takes forward prosecutions originating from police investigations. While the DPP must be a suitably qualified lawyer under section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, the DPP does not take on cases themselves and instead plays an administrative and leadership role. In this way, while the DPP may be referred to as a prosecutor, the individual in the role would not take any cases to court. The DPP is appointed by His Majesty&#x27;s Attorney General for England and Wales, and the Attorney General also has supervisory authority as the sponsor of the CPS; however, the CPS is an independent body and the Attorney General cannot direct particular prosecutions. Unlike in the United States and other jurisdictions, the Attorney General is not a prosecutor in England and Wales. Instead, the role is a political office of the chief legal advisor to the executive.

Crown Prosecutors are lawyers who work for the CPS. They are responsible for researching, advising police investigations, preparing cases for trial and sometimes presenting the case at trial. These lawyers may also be referred to as prosecutors. A number of other bodies have authority to bring prosecutions in England and Wales, including the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA), and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These organisations and their legal representatives may be called prosecutors. This is the same for any person, organisation, or their representatives during a private prosecution. Finally, when cases are brought to trial, a barrister or solicitor with higher rights of audience may present the case before a magistrate or a judge (with or without a jury). In these instances, referring to the prosecutor would refer to the lawyer conducting the case during trial. In most serious offences, the CPS or other prosecuting authority will instruct a barrister to represent them. In the most serious cases, this may be a King&#x27;s Counsel, and barristers may work in teams with a leader directing juniors. Unlike in the United States, these prosecuting barristers will work on a case-by-case basis, and so may also engage in defence work; they will not be employed solely to undertake prosecution advocacy.

==== Approach of the CPS to prosecutions ====
Crown Prosecutors are bound by a strict code of conduct, known as the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which governs how cases are charged and trials conducted. This fundamental code is supported by a range of other policies, most notably the Director&#x27;s Guidance on Charging. The first stage in prosecuting a case is deciding to charge the suspect, and it is this process which begins the prosecution. The CPS has the authority to decide whether a person is charged in all offences. However, the police may charge all summary offences, and either-way offences when there is an anticipated guilty plea. The nature of the offence is suitable for sentence in the magistrates&#x27; court.

In order to charge, the circumstances must meet the Full Code Test. In some urgent cases, a lower Threshold Test can be applied to get a charge quickly; however, the Full Code Test must then be applied at the earliest opportunity. The Full Code Test has two stages; both parts are equal and must be met before a prosecution can be brought. 
The Threshold Test must be kept under proactive and continuous review, and should only be used in rare and urgent circumstances.

==== Prosecutions by other government agencies ====
State investigative agencies such as the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), alongside independent prosecutors like the Service Prosecuting Authority, may all bring prosecutions themselves without using the CPS. Nevertheless, these prosecutors will follow the standards set by the Code of Crown Prosecutors alongside their own prosecution policies, which may deal with issues specific to the types of crime they engage with. There may, at times, be confusion as to which agency is responsible for having brought a prosecution. Which agency is prosecuting may affect whether an offence can be properly tried, as not all agencies can investigate and prosecute all offences. In &quot;R v Stafford Justices ex parte Customs and Excise Commissioners&quot; (1991) 2 All ER 201, it was found by the court that a prosecution is instituted by the police only when they have investigated, arrested and brought the arrested person to the custody officer. A case is not instituted by the police simply because a custody officer at a police station charges the suspect. Applying the same principle, proceedings are instituted by another prosecuting agency when they have been solely responsible for the investigation and arrest of the suspect, even though the suspect is taken to the police station to be charged by a custody officer.

The CPS advise that another prosecuting authority should probably conduct a case if any of the following factors apply:

* the police did not conduct the majority of the investigation; 
* the police were only involved in overseeing a search, effecting an arrest or assisting other investigators in the conduct of an interview; 
* the other authority is in possession of all the main exhibits; and
* someone other than a police officer is named on the charge sheet as the person accepting the charge or as the officer in the case.

==== Prosecutions requiring special consent ====
Prosecutions under certain acts require the consent of the Attorney General or DPP before they can proceed. In practice, the following types of consent may be required:

The range of offences which require consent is wide, a list of the offences can be found at Annex 1 of &quot;Consents to Prosecute&quot;.

==== Private prosecutions ====
In England and Wales, there is a statutorily protected common law right for any person to institute a private prosecution. This right is retained by section 6(1) Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985. Some organisations regularly use private prosecutions on a large scale to achieve an institutional goal, for example the vast majority of prosecutions under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 are prosecuted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) as private prosecutions. The Post Office also undertook a wide array of private prosecutions against post masters, leading to a subsequent scandal in which these prosecutions have widely come to be seen as a miscarriage of justice. The RSPCA have come under strong criticism for lacking sufficient independence to act as a prosecutor from the independent &#x27;Wooler&#x27; review; the Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and the Justice Select Committee, given they also investigate the offences and campaign politically for animal rights. The ongoing issues with private prosecutions outlined above has led to the Justice Select Committee calling for a closer examination of the process and regulation by government.

It is usually practically difficult for an individual to bring a private prosecution given the high cost – estimated by the Ministry of Justice at £8,500 on average. Even if a private prosecutor is not legally qualified, they must meet the usual legal requirements lawyers must undertake including the Criminal Procedure Rules and appropriate disclosure standards.

==== DPP&#x27;s power to take over private prosecutions ====
The DPP has authority to take over any prosecution instituted by another person or organisation, and to discontinue the prosecution if they see fit. The CPS have set out public guidance on when they will take over a prosecution; this indicates that the CPS should take over and continue with the prosecution if the papers clearly show all of the following:

* the evidential sufficiency stage of the Full Code Test is met;
* the public interest stage of the Full Code Test is met; and
* there is a particular need for the CPS to take over the prosecution.

The final consideration is designed to cover the situation where, for whatever reason, the investigative authorities with which the CPS usually deals have not brought the case to the CPS&#x27; attention and yet it is a case that merits the prosecution being conducted by a public prosecuting authority rather than by a private individual.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, most crimes are prosecuted by a Police Prosecutor, an employee of the New Zealand Police. The most serious crimes, which are about 5% of all crimes, is outsourced to a lawyer working at private law firm known as a Crown prosecutor.

===Scotland===
Although Scots law is a mixed system, its civil law jurisdiction indicates its civil law heritage. Here, all prosecutions are carried out by Procurators Fiscal and Advocates Depute on behalf of the Lord Advocate, and, in theory, they can direct investigations by Police Scotland. In very serious cases, a Procurator Fiscal, Advocate Depute, or even the Lord Advocate may take charge of a police investigation. It is at the discretion of the Procurator Fiscal, Advocate Depute, or Lord Advocate to take a prosecution to court, and to decide on whether or not to prosecute it under solemn procedure or summary procedure. Other remedies are open to a prosecutor in Scotland, including fiscal fines and non-court based interventions, such as rehabilitation and social work. All prosecutions are handled within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. Procurators fiscal will usually refer cases involving minors to Children&#x27;s Hearings, which are not courts of law, but a panel of lay members empowered to act in the interests of the child.

===United States===
The United States is the only country in the world where citizens elect prosecutors. The director of a prosecution office is known by any of several names depending on the jurisdiction, most commonly district attorney. Other names include state&#x27;s attorney, state attorney, county attorney, and commonwealth&#x27;s attorney. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case against an individual or a corporation suspected of breaking the law, initiating and directing further criminal investigations, guiding and recommending the sentencing of offenders, and are the only attorneys allowed to participate in grand jury proceedings.

The titles of prosecutors in state courts vary from state to state and level of government (i.e. city, county, and state) and include the terms District Attorney in New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Oklahoma; City Attorney in California cities (typically prosecute only minor and misdemeanor offenses) Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney in Kentucky and Virginia; County Attorney in Nebraska, Minnesota, and Arizona; County Prosecutor in New Jersey, Ohio, and Indiana; District Attorney General in Tennessee; Prosecuting Attorney in Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Washington, and West Virginia, as well as in Missouri where cities additionally use City Attorneys to prosecute on their behalf; State&#x27;s Attorney in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, North Dakota, and Vermont; State Prosecutor; Attorney General in Delaware and Rhode Island; and Solicitor in South Carolina.

Prosecutors are most often chosen through local elections, and typically hire other attorneys as deputies or assistants to conduct most of the actual work of the office. United States Attorneys are appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate. They represent the federal government in federal court in both civil and criminal cases. Private attorneys general can bring criminal cases on behalf of private parties in some states. Prosecutors are required by state and federal laws to follow certain rules. For example, the government must disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense; must disclose matters affecting the credibility of prosecution witnesses, such as an agreement to dismiss the witness&#x27;s own charges in exchange for their testimony; must not destroy potentially useful evidence in bad faith; and must not use false testimony to secure a conviction. Failure to follow these rules may result in a finding of prosecutorial misconduct, although a 2013 investigation found that actual discipline for prosecutorial misconduct was lacking.

Prosecutors are also tasked with seeking justice in their prosecutions. &quot;The United States Attorney,&quot; explained the U.S. Supreme Court, is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the two-fold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor—indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.

Prosecutors in some jurisdictions have the discretion to not pursue criminal charges, even when there is probable cause, if they determine that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction. Prosecutors may dismiss charges in this situation by seeking a voluntary dismissal or nolle prosequi. In Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the Commonwealth. In California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, and New York, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the People. In the remaining states, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the State.

== Civil law jurisdictions ==
Prosecutors are typically civil servants who possess a university degree in law and additional training in the administration of justice. In some countries, such as France and Italy, they are classed as judges.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the Senior Crown prosecutor (&quot;Procureur du Roi/Procureur des Konings&quot; in trial courts and &quot;Procureur Général/Procureur-Generaal&quot; in appellate courts) is supported by subordinate Crown prosecutors (&quot;substituts/substituten&quot;). They open preliminary investigations and can hold a suspect in custody for up to 48 hours. When necessary, a Crown prosecutor will request an examining judge (&quot;juge d&#x27;instruction&quot;/&quot;onderzoeksrechter&quot;) be appointed to lead a judicial inquest. With a judge investigating, Crown prosecutors do not conduct the interrogatories, but simply lay out the scope of the crimes which the judge and law enforcement forces investigate (&quot;la saisine&quot;). Like defense counsel, Crown prosecutors can request or suggest further investigation be carried out. The Crown prosecutor is in charge of policy decisions and may prioritize cases and procedures as need be.

During a criminal trial, prosecutors must introduce and explain the case to the trier of fact, i.e., judges or jury. They generally suggest a reasonable sentence which the court is not obligated to follow; the court may decide on a tougher or softer sentence. Crown prosecutors also have a number of administrative duties. They may advise the court during civil actions. Under Belgian law, judges and prosecutors are judicial officers with equal rank and pay. The Minister of Justice can order a criminal investigation but cannot prevent one (&quot;droit d&#x27;injonction positive&quot;/&quot;positief injunctierecht&quot;).

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the public prosecutors form a body of autonomous civil servants—the Public Ministry (&quot;Ministério Público&quot;)—working both at the federal and state level. Members of the Federal Prosecution Service are divided in three ranks, according to the jurisdiction of the courts before which they officiate. Federal Prosecutors (&quot;Procuradores da República&quot;) officiate before single judges and lower courts, Federal Circuit Prosecutors (&quot;procuradores regionais da República&quot;) before federal appellate courts, and Associate Federal Prosecutors General (&quot;subprocuradores gerais da República&quot;) before superior federal courts. The Prosecutor General of the Republic (&quot;Procurador Geral da República&quot;) heads the federal body, and tries cases before the Brazilian Supreme Court.

At the state level, the career is usually divided in state prosecutors (&quot;promotores de Justiça&quot;) who practice before the lower courts and state apellate prosecutors (&quot;procuradores de Justiça&quot;) who practice before the state courts of appeals. There are also military prosecutors whose career, although linked to the federal prosecutors, is divided in a manner similar to state prosecutors. In Brazil, the prosecutors&#x27; main job is to promote justice, as such they have the duty of not only trying criminal cases, but, if during the trial, they become convinced of a defendant&#x27;s innocence, requesting the judge to acquit him. The prosecutor&#x27;s office has always the last word on whether criminal offenses will or will not be charged, with the exception of those rare cases in which Brazilian law allows for private prosecution. In such cases, the prosecutor will officiate as &quot;custos legis&quot;, being responsible to ensure that justice is indeed carried out. Although empowered by law to do so, prosecutors conduct criminal investigations only in major cases, usually involving police or public officials&#x27; wrongdoings. Also, they are in charge of external control over police activity and requesting the initiation of a police investigation.

The power of individual prosecutors to hold criminal investigations was controversial and, although massively supported by judges, prosecutors and the general population, it was contested before the Supremo Tribunal Federal, but in 2015, this Court decided favorably to its power (RGE n. 593.727-MG). According to a 2012 law, the chief of police (&quot;delegado de polícia&quot;), as the police authority, is responsible for conducting the criminal investigation in Brazil by means of a police investigation (&quot;inquérito policial&quot;) or other procedure provided by law that has the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances, materiality, and authorship of criminal offenses. Similar provisions are found in the Code of Criminal Procedure and in article 144 of the federal constitution. Beside their criminal duties, Brazilian prosecutors are among those authorized by the Brazilian constitution to bring action against private individuals, commercial enterprises, and the federal, state and municipal governments, in the defense of minorities, the environment, consumers, and the civil society in general.

=== France ===

In France, the Office of the Prosecutor includes a Chief Prosecutor (&quot;Procureur de la République&quot; in trial courts and &quot;procureur général&quot; in appellate courts or the Court of Cassation) and his deputies and assistants (&quot;avocats généraux&quot; and &quot;substituts&quot;). The Chief Prosecutor generally initiates preliminary investigations and, if necessary, asks that an examining judge (&quot;juge d&#x27;instruction&quot;) be assigned to lead a formal judicial investigation. When an investigation is led by a judge, the prosecutor plays a supervisory role, defining the scope of the crimes being examined by the judge and law enforcement forces. Like defense counsel, the chief prosecutor may petition or move for further investigation. During criminal proceedings, prosecutors are responsible for presenting the case at trial to either the bench or the jury. Prosecutors generally suggest advisory sentencing guidelines, but the sentence remains at the court&#x27;s discretion to decide, to increase or reduce as it sees fit. In addition, prosecutors have several administrative duties.

Prosecutors are considered magistrates under French law, as in most civil law countries. While the defense and the plaintiff are both represented by common lawyers, who sit (on chairs) on the courtroom floor, the prosecutor sits on a platform as the judge does, although he does not participate in deliberation. Judges and prosecutors are trained at the same school, and regard one other as colleagues.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the &quot;Staatsanwalt&quot; (&quot;state attorney&quot;) is a life-tenured public official in the senior judicial service belonging to the same corps as judges. The Staatsanwalt heads pre-trial criminal investigations, decides whether to press a charge or drop it, and represents the government in criminal courts. The Staatsanwalt not only has the &quot;professional responsibility&quot; not to withhold exculpatory information, but is also required by law to actively determine such circumstances and to make them available to the defendant or the defense attorney. If the Staatsanwalt is not convinced of the defendant&#x27;s guilt, the state attorney is required to plead against or in favor of the defendant according to the prosecutor&#x27;s own assessment. Prosecution is compulsory if the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to convict.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, a Prosecutor&#x27;s Office is composed of a Chief Prosecutor (&quot;procuratore capo&quot;) assisted by deputies (&quot;procuratori aggiunti&quot;) and assistants (&quot;sostituti procuratori&quot;). Prosecutors in Italy are judicial officers just like judges and are ceremonially referred to as &quot;Pubblico Ministero&quot; (&quot;Public Ministry&quot; or P.M.). Italian Prosecutors officiate as &quot;custos legis&quot;, being responsible to ensure that justice is indeed carried out. They are obligated under the Constitution to initiate preliminary investigations once they are informed or take personal notice of a criminal act—&quot;notitia criminis&quot;—or receive a bill of complaint. They can direct investigations or conduct them through orders and directives given to (judicial) police detectives, who can make their own parallel investigations in coordination with the Prosecutor. If enough evidence has been gathered in order to proceed, the prosecution is compulsory and it must move from preliminary investigations to initiate trial proceedings. At trial, the prosecuting attorney has to handle the prosecution but has an overarching duty to promote justice. In practice, this duty means that prosecutors are prohibited from withholding exculpatory evidence and must request that the judge acquit the defendant if, during the trial, the prosecutor becomes convinced of the defendant&#x27;s innocence, or agrees that there is no evidence that proves his guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.

In appellate courts, the Office of the Prosecutor is called &quot;Procura Generale&quot; and the Chief Prosecutor the &quot;Procuratore Generale&quot; (PG). The &quot;Procuratore Generale presso la Corte di Cassazione&quot; is the Chief General Prosecutor before the Corte di Cassazione, the Supreme Court of Italy. Prosecutors are allowed during their career to act in the other&#x27;s stead, although a ruling by the Constitutional Court of Italy stated that prosecutors who wish to become judges must relocate to another region and are prohibited to sit or hear trials that they themselves initiated.

=== Japan ===

In Japan, are professional officials who have considerable powers of investigation, prosecution, superintendence of criminal execution and so on. Prosecutors can direct police for investigation purposes, and sometimes investigate directly. Only prosecutors can prosecute criminals in principle, and prosecutors can decide whether to prosecute or not. High-ranking officials of the Ministry of Justice are largely prosecutors.

===Poland===
The highest-ranking prosecutor office of the Prokuratura in Poland is the Prokurator Generalny (General Prosecutor), who is the chief of the Prokuratura Krajowa (National Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office). The GP has 5 deputies. The structure of Public Prosecution in Poland is four-level: &quot;Prokuratura Krajowa&quot; — National Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office; &quot;prokuratury regionalne&quot; — provincial public prosecutor&#x27;s offices (11); &quot;prokuratury okręgowe&quot; — regional public prosecutor&#x27;s offices (45); and &quot;prokuratury rejonowe&quot; — district public prosecutor&#x27;s offices (358). Apart from a brief period between 2010 and 2016, the position of Public Prosecutor General has been held concurrently by the Minister of Justice.

=== South Korea ===

Prosecutors are public officials who are members of the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. Prosecutors can conduct crime investigations directly or indirectly. They are responsible for the entire process of investigations and court prosecutions. Since Korean modern law was designed after civil law, the role of Korean prosecutors is similar or identical to that of European equivalents in commanding investigations, determining indictable cases and prosecuting process. A prosecutor has the power to prohibit a defendant or an accused individual from departing the Republic of Korea via an &quot;international hold&quot;.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, public prosecutors are lawyers who work out of the Swedish Prosecution Authority () and direct police investigations of serious crimes. For all criminal cases, public prosecutors decide arrests and charges on behalf of the public and are the only public officers who can make such decisions. Plaintiffs also have the option of hiring their own special prosecutor (&quot;enskilt åtal&quot;). The exception is cases concerning crimes against the freedom of the press for which the Chancellor of Justice acts as the prosecuting attorney. In court, the prosecutor is not necessarily in an adversarial relationship to the defendant, but is under an obligation to investigate and present information that may incriminate or exonerate the defendant. The prosecutor is not a judicial officer, nor do they participate in the private deliberations of the court. Public prosecutors are the only public officers who can decide to appeal cases to appellate courts. Otherwise, appeals are initiated by defense counsel, the plaintiff, their representatives, and other parties to the case (&quot;målsäganden&quot;). When a case has been decided by an appellate court, the right to appeal to the Supreme Court passes from the case&#x27;s prosecutor to the Prosecutor-General ().

== Socialist law jurisdictions ==

A Public Procurator is an office used in socialist law, which in some ways corresponds to that of a public prosecutor in other legal systems but with more far-reaching responsibilities, such as handling investigations otherwise performed by branches of the police. Conversely, the policing systems in socialist countries, such as the Militsiya of the Soviet Union, were not aimed at fulfilling the same roles as police forces in democratic countries.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
A Public Procurator is a position in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, analogous to both detective and public prosecutor. Legally, they are bound by Public Procurators&#x27; Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to Article 6, the functions and duties of public procurators are as follows:

#Supervise the enforcement of laws according to law.
#Public prosecution on behalf of the State.
#Investigate criminal cases directly accepted by the People&#x27;s Procuratorates as provided by law.
#Other functions and duties as provided by law.

===Vietnam===
The Supreme People&#x27;s Procuracy is the highest office of public procurators in Vietnam.

== Institutional independence ==

In many countries, the prosecutor&#x27;s administration is directly subordinate to the executive branch (e.g., the United States Attorney General is a member of the President&#x27;s cabinet). In some other countries, such as Brazil or Italy, the prosecutors are judicial civil servants, so they have the same liberties and independence that judges traditionally enjoy. In other countries, a form of private prosecution is available, meaning persons or private entities can directly petition the courts to hold trial against someone they feel is guilty of a crime, should the prosecutor refuse to indict.

==Private prosecution==
In the early history of England, victims of a crime and their family had the right to hire a private attorney to prosecute criminal charges against the person alleged to have injured the victim. In the 18th century, prosecution of almost all criminal offences in England was private, usually by the victim. In Colonial America, because of Dutch and possibly French practice and the expansion of the office of attorney general, public officials came to dominate the prosecution of crimes; however, privately funded prosecutors constituted a significant element of the state criminal justice system throughout the nineteenth century. The use of a private prosecutor was incorporated into the common law of Virginia but is no longer permitted there. Private prosecutors were also used in North Carolina as late as 1975. Private prosecution has been used in Nigeria, although the practice is being phased out.
