<text>Peyton Williams Manning (born March 24, 1976) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons. Nicknamed &quot;the Sheriff&quot;, he spent 14 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and four with the Denver Broncos. Manning is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. A member of the Manning football dynasty, he is the second son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning, older brother of former NFL quarterback Eli Manning, and uncle of Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning. He played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers, winning the Maxwell, Davey O&#x27;Brien, and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm awards as a senior en route to victory in the 1997 SEC Championship Game.

Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 NFL draft by the Colts and served as their starting quarterback from 1998 to 2010. He helped transform the struggling Colts franchise into consistent playoff contenders, leading them to 11 playoff appearances, eight division titles, three AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship title in Super Bowl XLI, the franchise&#x27;s first in over three decades and first since relocating to Indianapolis. Manning was also named Super Bowl MVP in the victory. After undergoing neck surgery that sidelined him for the 2011 season, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Broncos. Serving as the Broncos starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015, he helped them clinch their division each season and reach two Super Bowls. Manning&#x27;s career ended with a victory in Super Bowl 50, making him the first starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl for more than one franchise.

Manning holds many NFL records, including most MVP awards, quarterback first-team All-Pro selections, 4,000-yard passing seasons, single-season passing yards, and single-season passing touchdowns. He is also third in career passing yards and career passing touchdowns. Helping lead both the Colts and Broncos to two Super Bowls each, Manning is the only quarterback to have reached the Super Bowl with multiple franchises with multiple starts for each. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life==
Manning went to Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he led the Greenies football team to a 34–5 record during his three seasons as the starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993. While at Newman, he began wearing the #18 jersey in honor of his older brother Cooper, who had to give up football due to spinal stenosis. Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback. Newman has since retired the #18 jersey and it can be seen hanging in the school gym. Manning was among the most sought-after high school players in the country and was recruited by about 60 colleges, including Florida, Florida State, LSU, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, and his father&#x27;s alma mater Ole Miss.

==College career==
Manning chose to play college football for the University of Tennessee Volunteers under head coach Phillip Fulmer. Many fans were surprised that he did not pick the Ole Miss Rebels, for whom his father Archie played, and his parents received many angry phone calls and letters. He became Tennessee&#x27;s all-time leading passer with 11,201 yards and 89 touchdowns and won 39 of 45 games as a starter, breaking the Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for career wins.

===1994 season===

As a freshman, Manning began the season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, he was one of three quarterbacks to come off the bench after starter Jerry Colquitt suffered a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, he was not able to generate any offense, only handing the ball off three times, and was pulled from the game. Two weeks later, in a 31–0 loss to the #1 Florida Gators, Manning completed his first collegiate pass. During the season&#x27;s fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and he took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but Manning threw his first two collegiate touchdowns in the game. He was named the team&#x27;s starter and remained so for the rest of his college career. In his first start, the following week against Washington State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl. He finished his first collegiate season 89 of 144 for 1,141 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and six interceptions.

===1995 season===

Manning and the Vols opened the 1995 season with victories over East Carolina and SEC rival Georgia before heading off to Gainesville to face off against the rival Gators. Against Florida, he threw 326 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Vols to a 30–21 halftime lead. However, the Gators outscored the Vols 41–7 in the second half, winning 62–37. This was the Vols&#x27; only loss of the season, as they won their remaining eight regular season games, including a 41–14 win over rival Alabama. The Vols defeated Ohio State by a score of 20–14 in the Citrus Bowl. The Vols ended the season ranked third, and he came in sixth place in Heisman Trophy voting. He finished his sophomore season 244 of 380 for 2,954 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and four interceptions.

===1996 season===

The Vols opened the 1996 season ranked No. 2 behind Nebraska. However, after winning their first two games against UNLV and UCLA, the Vols again lost to Florida by a score of 35–29, with Manning throwing four interceptions. After winning their next four games, the Vols were defeated by Memphis, even though Manning threw 296 yards. The Vols won the rest of their games, including a 48–28 win in the Citrus Bowl over Northwestern, a game in which Manning threw 408 yards and four touchdowns; he was named the game&#x27;s MVP. His 243 pass completions and 63.9% completion percentage led the SEC that year. He finished the 1996 season with 3,287 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He also came in eighth place in Heisman Trophy voting. Manning completed his degree in three years, a Bachelor of Arts in speech communication. He was predicted to be the top overall pick in the NFL draft, but announced his decision to stay at Tennessee for his senior year in an event at Thompson-Boling Arena.

=== Sexual assault allegation ===

In 1996, while attending the University of Tennessee, Manning was accused of sexual assault by trainer Jamie Ann Naughright after she alleged that he pressed his genitals against her face during a foot examination. Manning said that he was pulling a prank by &quot;mooning&quot; Malcolm Saxon, a cross country runner who was in the room as Naughright bent over to examine him. Saxon initially supported Manning&#x27;s story before stating in an affidavit and a written letter to Manning that Manning had intentionally exposed himself to Naughright, but did not mention witnessing any physical contact during the incident. Naughright settled with the university for $300,000 for its alleged failure in four incidents and resigned from the school. She also made a list of 33 complaints about the school. Naughright filed a defamation lawsuit against Manning and three other parties in 2002, claiming that Manning defamed her in a book he wrote with his father and author John Underwood in which he described her as having a &quot;vulgar mouth&quot;. The lawsuit was settled after the court ruled there was sufficient evidence for it to be heard by a jury. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed due to confidentiality terms.

===1997 season===

In his senior season, Manning and the Vols opened the season with victories against Texas Tech and UCLA, but for the third time in his career, Manning fell to Florida 33–20. The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10–1, and advanced to the SEC Championship game against Auburn. Down 20–7 in the second quarter, Manning led the Vols to a 30–29 comeback victory. Throwing 373 yards and four touchdowns, he was named the game&#x27;s MVP, but injured himself in the process. The #3 Vols were matched-up with #2 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl; if Tennessee won &quot;and&quot; top-ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl, the Vols would have won the national championship. However, the Vols&#x27; defense could not stop Nebraska&#x27;s rushing attack, giving up over 400 rushing yards in a 42–17 loss.

As a senior, Manning won many awards; he was a consensus first-team All-American, the Maxwell Award winner, the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award winner, the Johnny Unitas Award winner, and the Best College Player ESPY award winner, among others. He finished as the runner-up to Charles Woodson in the 1997 Heisman Trophy voting. He became the fourth player in school history to finish as the runner-up. In 2005, Tennessee retired Manning&#x27;s number (16). One of the streets leading to Neyland Stadium was renamed to Peyton Manning Pass. Manning finished his final season at Tennessee with 3,819 passing yards, 36 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. While at the University of Tennessee, Manning excelled academically and was elected to the Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa society in 1997. He also received the National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete Award.

===Post-collegiate honors===
Manning was inducted into the Tennessee Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016. He was also named the 2016 Tennessean of the Year by the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. Manning was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017, his first year of eligibility for the honor, and was inducted during a ceremony in December. He joined his father Archie in the Hall of Fame, making them the first father and son duo to both be inducted as players.

==Professional career==
===Overview===

Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft. He became the second player in Tennessee&#x27;s school history to be drafted #1 overall, the first since George Cafego in the 1940 NFL draft. He started as a rookie and went on to play for the Colts for 13 full seasons before being sidelined by a neck injury, which cost him the entire 2011 season. After recovering from the injury, he was released by the Colts and joined the Denver Broncos for whom he played from the 2012 season to the 2015 season. Excluding the year lost to the neck injury, Manning played in 17 NFL seasons.

Manning is considered to be one of the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time. He was named the NFL&#x27;s most valuable player a record five times (four times with the Colts, once with the Broncos), was named to the Pro Bowl 14 times, and named a first-team All-Pro seven times. As a starter up until the end of the 2015 season, he had a career winning percentage of .702 in the regular season. He held the NFL record for career touchdown passes from 2014 to 2019 and the career passing yards record from 2015 to 2018. Manning is also the only quarterback in NFL history to appear in four Super Bowls with a different head coach each time, playing under Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox, and Gary Kubiak when he reached the league&#x27;s championship.

The most commonly cited criticism of Manning&#x27;s professional career is that despite great success and impressive statistics during the regular season, he did not have similar levels of success in the postseason. His career postseason record as a starter was a more modest 14–13 compared to his 186–79 regular season record. However, Manning won two Super Bowls in Super Bowl XLI and Super Bowl 50 and was named MVP in the former. During the early part of Manning&#x27;s career, commentators noted that &quot;his record-breaking stats were written off because of the Colts&#x27; postseason failures.&quot; Conversely, Manning&#x27;s final season in 2015 was statistically his weakest, but saw him end his career with a Super Bowl victory through the assistance of the Broncos&#x27; No Fly Zone defense.

===Indianapolis Colts===
====1998 season====

Despite concerns about his arm strength and mobility, Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts. Although many considered Washington State quarterback Ryan Leaf to be his rival for the first selection in the draft, as Leaf had a higher quarterback rating, all six experts &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; consulted believed that Manning was superior. Five said that they would take him first in the draft; Sid Gillman said about Manning, &quot;this is a pro quarterback.&quot;

The Colts&#x27; scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team&#x27;s management and coaches liked Manning&#x27;s attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts&#x27; staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian, who had the final say on the draft selection, recalled Manning saying &quot;I&#x27;ll leave you with this thought. If you take me, I promise you we will win a championship. If you don&#x27;t, I promise I&#x27;ll come back and kick your ass.&quot; Contrary to what he heard about their athletic ability, Polian said that Manning &quot;far and away had the stronger arm, threw a tighter ball&quot; than Leaf.

In Manning&#x27;s rookie season under head coach Jim Mora, he threw 3,739 yards and 26 touchdowns, set five different NFL rookie records including most touchdown passes in a season and most interceptions in a rookie year, and was named to the NFL All-Rookie First Team. In his NFL debut, Manning was 21-of-37 for 302 passing yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions. He threw his first career touchdown, a six-yard pass to Marvin Harrison, in the fourth quarter of the 24–15 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Manning&#x27;s first win came against fellow rookie Leaf, 17–12 over the San Diego Chargers in week 5. Two weeks later, Manning faced off against Steve Young; he threw three touchdowns, tying a Colts rookie record, but the San Francisco 49ers kicked a late field goal to win 34–31. In November against the New York Jets, Manning threw three touchdowns in a 24–23 win; he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. It was the first game-winning drive of Manning&#x27;s career, as he threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Marcus Pollard. Manning was certainly a bright spot in 1998 for the Colts with 3,739 passing yards and 26 passing touchdowns, but also threw a league high 28 interceptions as the team struggled to a 3–13 record with a defense that gave up more than 27 points per game. The Colts lost many close games, including five games where they led by double digits at some point.

====1999 season====

Manning and the Colts started the 1999 season splitting the first two games with the Buffalo Bills (31–14 win) and New England Patriots (31–28 loss). In week 3, against the San Diego Chargers, Manning threw over 404 yards, scored his first professional rushing touchdown, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort in the 27–19 victory. The Colts responded by winning 11 of their remaining 12 games, finishing 13–3 and the AFC East division. In week 11, against the Philadelphia Eagles, Manning threw a then career-high 80-yard touchdown pass to Terrence Wilkins in the 44–17 victory. The ten-game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record. His seven game-winning drives were tied for the most in NFL history until Matthew Stafford had eight in the 2016 season. Manning finished the year with 4,135 passing yards and 26 passing touchdowns, and was named both Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl, both firsts for him. He finished third in the NFL in pass completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns. As the second seed in the AFC, the Colts earned a first round bye and faced the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. The Colts lost 19–16 to the Super Bowl-bound Titans and Manning was limited to 19-of-42 passing attempts for 227 passing yards and one touchdown run. In the Pro Bowl, he threw 270 yards and two touchdowns in the 51–31 loss.

====2000 season====

The Colts started the season splitting two games with the Kansas City Chiefs (27–14 win) and Oakland Raiders (38–31 loss). The Colts responded with a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars, a 43–14 win in which Manning threw 430 yards and four touchdowns; Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. The Colts won four of their next five games, including a 30–23 win against the New England Patriots in which Manning had the first perfect passer rating of his career, but then lost four of the five games following that. The Colts regained their momentum, winning their final three games, including a 31–10 win over the Minnesota Vikings in week 17. Manning threw four touchdowns in the win and was again named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. The win gave the Colts a 10–6 record as well as a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. He finished the season with league-highs across the board with 357 pass completions for 4,413 passing yards and 33 passing touchdowns, and was named Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl. In the Wild Card Round, the Colts lost to the Miami Dolphins 23–17 in overtime. Manning threw 194 yards and a touchdown in the loss.

====2001 season====

Manning and the Colts introduced the no-huddle offense, and used it to great effect in a week 1 rout over the New York Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later, the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a 42–26 win over the Buffalo Bills, with Manning throwing 421 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. However, the Colts lost the following week in a 38–17 loss to the New England Patriots, which was the first meeting between Manning and Tom Brady. The Colts continued their slide, losing their following two games. The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost seven of their last nine games. In the stretch, Manning threw a career-high 86-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Pollard in the 34–20 loss to the New Orleans Saints. After a 40–21 home loss to the San Francisco 49ers, in which Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in the game, coach Jim Mora uttered his famous &quot;Playoffs? Don&#x27;t talk about playoffs,&quot; at the press conference. Despite the 6–10 record, Manning finished the season with 4,131 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and four rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league. However, the defense allowed the most points in the league and Mora was fired after the season.

====2002 season====

Before the 2002 season, Tony Dungy became Manning&#x27;s second head coach in the NFL. The Colts began the 2002 season with a 4–1 record before a three-game losing streak sent them to 4–4. The Colts responded by winning all but two of their remaining games, including a 35–13 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in which Manning had a perfect passer rating for the second time in his career, giving them a 10–6 record and a spot in the playoffs. He finished the 2002 season with 4,200 passing yards and 27 passing touchdowns and was named to the Pro Bowl. The Colts were defeated by the New York Jets in the Wild Card Round, 41–0, with Manning passing only 137 yards, falling 0–3 in the playoffs to start his career.

====2003 season: First MVP====
The 2003 Colts began the season 5–0, including a 55–21 blowout over the New Orleans Saints in which Manning recorded his third perfect passer rating game and threw six touchdown passes, earning him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. On &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, against the defending champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Colts trailed 35–14 in the final five minutes. After one short touchdown drive, the Colts recovered the onside kick. Manning threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th and 6 to make it 35–28. With 1:41 remaining, Manning got the ball back and drove the offense 85 yards for the game-tying touchdown. He set up the winning 29-yard field goal in overtime for a 38–35 win. It was the only time in NFL history a team won a game after trailing by 21 points in the final four minutes of regulation. Manning threw 386 yards in the game.

After an overtime loss to the Carolina Panthers in week 6, the Colts won all but three of their remaining games, finishing 12–4. On November 30, the Colts faced the 9–2 New England Patriots in what had a memorable ending in one of the NFL&#x27;s top rivalries of the 2000s. The Colts trailed 31–10 late in the third quarter before Manning threw three touchdown passes in a span of six minutes to tie the game. Trailing 38–34 in the final minutes, the Colts had three plays at the one-yard line to try to score the winning touchdown. Running back Edgerrin James was stopped on fourth down by linebacker Willie McGinest and the Patriots won. In a week 14 win against the Atlanta Falcons, Manning threw five touchdowns and was named Offensive Player of the Week a second time. After the game, Manning was awarded Player of the Week honors for the third time that season. During the season, Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September and was named the AP NFL co-MVP along with Titans quarterback Steve McNair. Manning also received the ESPY Award for Best NFL Player. Manning led the league with 379 pass completions for 4,267 passing yards and threw 29 touchdowns; he was named first-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl.

In the Wild Card Round, Manning and the Colts defeated the Denver Broncos, 41–10, for his first playoff win. He threw 377 yards and five touchdowns in the game, earning him a perfect passer rating, his second of the season and the fourth of his career. In the Divisional Round, Manning led the Colts to a 38–31 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. In the victory, he threw 304 yards and three touchdowns. In the AFC Championship, Manning was shut down by the New England Patriots&#x27; top-ranked defense and posted the third-lowest passer rating of his career at 35.5. The Patriots&#x27; defense intercepted Manning four times and sacked him another four, as the Colts lost the game by a score of 24–14.

====2004 season: Second MVP====
The 2004 Colts opened the season with a 27–24 loss to the New England Patriots after placekicker Mike Vanderjagt missed a game-tying field goal in the closing seconds of the game. The Colts won their next four games including a 45–31 win over the Green Bay Packers in which Manning threw five touchdowns, earning him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, but then lost their next two games to the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Kansas City Chiefs, despite Manning throwing 840 yards combined in the two games. The Colts responded well, winning their next eight games before losing their final regular season game to Denver, a game in which Manning played only the first series. During the month of November, Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week twice; once for his five-touchdown performance in a 49–14 blowout over the Houston Texans and once for his performance in a 41–9 road win against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving in which he threw six touchdowns in less than three quarters. For his performances in November, Manning earned AFC Offensive Player of the Month honors. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for a fourth time in the week 16 game against the San Diego Chargers where he led the Colts to a 34–31 victory after trailing by 15 in the fourth quarter. With the Colts facing a 4th and 4 at their own 26, Manning waved the punt team off the field and completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne for the first down. He finished the drive with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley, his 49th touchdown pass of the season, breaking Dan Marino&#x27;s record of 48. After the two-point conversion to tie, Manning got the ball first in overtime and set up the winning field goal. The Colts clinched the AFC&#x27;s third seed with the win.

During the season, Manning threw 4,557 yards, had a then record 121.1 passer rating, and a then-record 49 touchdown passes while throwing only 10 interceptions. He was a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection. Manning&#x27;s 2004 season was voted the second greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. He achieved this despite the 2004 season being the only season of his career where he threw less than 500 passes. He finished with a league-high 13.6 yards per pass completion and 9.2 yards per pass attempt in 2004. Manning&#x27;s 9.9% touchdown rate for the season was tied for the sixth highest rate in NFL history (with George Blanda in 1961), and it ranks as the highest by a quarterback in the 21st century. His 49 touchdown passes is currently the third highest ever and his 121.1 passer rating is the second highest ever. He was selected as the 2004 NFL MVP drawing 49 of 50 votes, was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year, and was named the Best NFL Player at the ESPY Awards for the second consecutive year. Manning also received the ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance for his 49 touchdown passes. The Colts finished the season with a 12–4 record and their second straight AFC South title. The Colts scored a franchise record 522 points. Three Colts receivers had 1,000 yard seasons with at least 10 touchdowns that season, also a record. Sports statistics cite &quot;Football Outsiders&quot; calculates that Manning had the best season for a quarterback, play-by-play, in 2004.

In the Wild Card Round against the Denver Broncos at home, Manning threw 458 yards and four touchdowns in the 49–24 victory. However, the Colts&#x27; 2004 season ended in Foxborough for a second straight season with a 20–3 loss against New England in the Divisional Round, and Manning recorded a season-low passer rating of 69.3. It was Manning&#x27;s seventh consecutive loss to the Patriots in Foxborough and the Colts&#x27; three points were their lowest single game point total since their opening game of the 2003 season.

====2005 season====
In 2005, the Colts had a greatly improved defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. This was Manning&#x27;s first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, and his three touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy made the decision to play all of his regular starters against the San Diego Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with 3,747 passing yards, which was the first time he threw less than 4,000 yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.

In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers visited the RCA Dome for the second AFC Divisional Round game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter with only a few minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending interception to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score and got the ball back down three points near the end of the game. On fourth down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down the sideline for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers&#x27; quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front of Harper and tackled him in the leg, saving a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, the Colts moved down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out. Manning finished the loss 22 of 38 for 290 yards and a touchdown.

Manning came in second place for the MVP award to Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander, ending his streak at two years. He was named the 2005 winner of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award and nominated for the FedEx Air Player of the Year Award, along with Tom Brady and Carson Palmer. Manning was named first-team All-Pro for the third consecutive year and named to the Pro Bowl squad.

====2006 season: Super Bowl XLI championship====
Manning opened the 2006 season against his brother Eli and the New York Giants on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. It was the first NFL game with starting quarterbacks who were brothers, and the Colts won 26–21. Manning threw 400 yards against the Houston Texans in a 43–24 victory, which earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. Manning also won the award for his 345 yards and four touchdown passes against the Washington Redskins in week 7. A second trip to New Jersey, this time to face the New York Jets, led to another Colts win. After taking the lead twice in the fourth quarter, Manning led a third scoring drive to finish with a one-yard quarterback sneak rushing touchdown in the last minute for a 31–28 win.

In a road game against the Denver Broncos, Manning again led three scoring drives in the fourth quarter in a 34–31 shootout win. He completed 32-of-39 passes for 345 yards and three touchdowns. Following a second straight season with a win at New England and a home win against Buffalo, the Colts were the NFL&#x27;s last unbeaten team at 9–0. The Colts became the first team in NFL history to record consecutive 9–0 starts to a season. Their first loss came in a 21–14 road loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Plagued by a run defense that allowed over 100 yards in every game, the Colts were 11–4 heading into their final game. Against the Miami Dolphins, Manning threw 282 yards, two touchdowns, and rushed for another touchdown. The Colts won 27–22, were AFC South division champions, and clinched the third seed in the AFC playoffs. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He ended the regular season with 4,397 passing yards and a league-leading 31 touchdown passes. His passer rating (101.0) was the highest in the league for the third year in a row. Manning helped the offense set an NFL record for third-down conversion rate in a season (56.1%).

Despite three interceptions, Manning completed 30 out of 38 passes for 268 yards and a touchdown as the Colts beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round by a score of 23–8. The following week, the Colts were limited to five field goals and no touchdowns, but defeated the Baltimore Ravens, 15–6. Manning was 15 of 30 for 170 yards and two interceptions in the Divisional Round victory. In the AFC Championship against the rival New England Patriots, the Colts trailed 14–3 when Manning threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Asante Samuel to give New England a 21–3 lead. Manning led the Colts to 32 points in the second half for a 38–34 victory, the final score coming late in the fourth quarter as Manning led the Colts on an 80-yard touchdown drive to take the lead for the first time in the game. He finished the game with 349 passing yards, one passing touchdown, and one rushing touchdown. The comeback was the largest deficit ever overcome in a conference championship.

Completing 25-of-38 passes for 247 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, Manning led the Colts to a 29–17 victory over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI and was named Super Bowl MVP. He became the first Colts player to receive the honor, as Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley was MVP of Super Bowl V, the franchise&#x27;s previous title. For his role in the Colts&#x27; championship run, Manning won the ESPY for Best Championship Performance. Manning was also named to the Pro Bowl and named Second-team All-Pro. After the Super Bowl win, Manning restructured his contract to save the Colts $8.2 million in salary cap space.

====2007 season====
The Colts opened the NFL season with seven wins, putting them against an undefeated New England Patriots squad in a match-up that was called &quot;Super Bowl 41 1/2.&quot; Manning and Joseph Addai helped the Colts to a 13–7 halftime lead, and an early fourth-quarter touchdown increased the lead to 20–10. However, Brady led the Patriots to two late touchdowns, giving Manning and the Colts their first loss of the season, 24–20. Manning finished the game with 225 passing yards, one passing touchdown, and a rushing touchdown.

Manning did not bounce back from the loss well. Against the San Diego Chargers, he threw a career-worst and franchise-record six interceptions. Despite this, he was able to rally the Colts from a 23–0 deficit to 23–21. He also gave Adam Vinatieri an opportunity to take the lead with a field goal, but Vinatieri&#x27;s 29-yard attempt missed, and the Colts fell to 7–2. Manning did not play particularly well against the Kansas City Chiefs either, throwing no touchdowns. However, he managed to lead the Colts on a late drive for a game-winning field goal, rushing for two yards on 4th and 1 in the process. Manning finished the game with 163 passing yards, allowing him to overtake 40,000 in his career. The victory was Manning&#x27;s 100th.

The Colts won their next five games, securing yet another AFC South title, as well as the AFC&#x27;s second-seed in the playoffs. In that stretch was a week 13 28–25 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars where he was 20 of 29 for 288 passing yards, four touchdowns, and an interception. For his performance against the Jaguars, he was named as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week. In the final game of the regular season, Manning played only two series before being replaced by back-up Jim Sorgi; the Colts lost the game to the Tennessee Titans, 16–10. Manning finished the season with 4,040 passing yards, 31 touchdown passes, and a quarterback rating of 98.0. In the Divisional Round, Manning and the Colts lost to the San Diego Chargers, 28–24. Manning helped the Colts to four leads but could not lead a final touchdown drive for the win. Manning finished the game with 402 yards and three touchdowns. He was seen cheering on his brother Eli and the New York Giants in their upset of the previously undefeated New England Patriots during Super Bowl XLII.

====2008 season: Third MVP====

On July 14, 2008, Manning had surgery to remove an infected bursa sac in his left knee. Manning, who wore a knee brace due to problems since he was in college, sat out all four preseason games and missed most of training camp.

Manning and the Colts started the 2008 season with a 1–2 record. In week 5, Manning used the fourth quarter to bring the Colts back from a 27–10 deficit in the last five minutes against the Houston Texans to a 31–27 victory. It was the first time an NFL team won a game in regulation after trailing by 17 points in the last five minutes. Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass on 4th and 6 to rookie tight end Tom Santi to make the deficit 27–17. Houston quarterback Sage Rosenfels, starting for the injured Matt Schaub, then fumbled the ball on a scramble, and it was returned 68 yards for a touchdown by Gary Brackett. After another Rosenfels fumble, Manning threw the 5-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. The Colts scored three touchdowns in 2:10.

On October 12, Manning led the Colts to a 31–3 blowout win at Lucas Oil Stadium against the Baltimore Ravens to avoid their first 0–3 start at home since the 1997 season. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 17th time in his career for his effort of three touchdown passes and 271 yards passing. It was revealed during the game by CBS commentators Jim Nantz and Phil Simms that Manning had a second surgery on his knee before the season started. Colts coach Tony Dungy confirmed this report the day after the game.

The Colts had their largest defeat of the season, 34–14, against the Green Bay Packers the following week. Manning threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. After a setback to the undefeated Tennessee Titans in week 8, the Colts opened up November with their annual showdown against the New England Patriots on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. Tied at 15 in the fourth quarter, Manning set up Adam Vinatieri for a 52-yard field goal that proved to be the winning points in an 18–15 victory. Manning completed 21-of-29 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns.

In a week 10 road game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had the league&#x27;s highest-ranked defense, they trailed 17–7 in the second quarter before Manning found tight end Dallas Clark for a two-yard touchdown to end the half 17–14. Down 20–17 in the fourth quarter, Manning found running back Dominic Rhodes uncovered for a 17-yard touchdown pass that would put the Colts up 24–20 for the rest of the game. It was Manning&#x27;s fourth game-winning drive (35th of his career) of the season. He completed 21 of 40 for 240 yards and three touchdowns (the 50th game of his career with 3+ touchdown passes). It was the first time the Colts won in Pittsburgh since 1968, breaking a streak of 12 straight losses. Against the Houston Texans, Manning threw 320 yards and two touchdowns while leading five consecutive scoring drives in a 33–27 victory, the third in a row for the Colts. Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time this season (18th time, career).

Following the Texans game, the Colts reeled off four consecutive wins to make their winning streak seven games. Needing a win to clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs, Manning had one of his best career performances against the Jacksonville Jaguars on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;. He completed his first 17 passes of the game. In addition to completing his last six completions the prior week against the Detroit Lions, Manning&#x27;s 23 straight completions fell one shy of the NFL record. The Colts trailed 14–0 in the first half and 24–14 to start the fourth quarter. Manning led his seventh fourth quarter win of the season and the Colts put the game away with a defensive touchdown for a 31–24 victory to clinch a seventh consecutive playoff berth. Manning completed 29-of-34 passes (85.7%) for 364 yards and three touchdowns. It increased his NFL record streak of seasons with 25 touchdown passes to 11. Manning and the Colts tied an NFL record by winning three games in a season in which they trailed by at least 14 points. For his efforts, Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in the 2008 season. It was the 19th time he won the award, passing Dan Marino for the most all-time since the award was originated in 1984. He also was selected as the FedEx Air Player of the Week. With the Colts&#x27; playoff seeding secured, Manning only played the opening drive in a shutout against the division-leading Titans in week 17. He completed all seven of his passes for 95 yards and a touchdown, extending his NFL record to nine seasons with 4,000 yards passing, and also extended the record to a sixth straight season he led the Colts to at least 12 wins. At the end of the 2008 season, Manning was named NFL MVP for the third time, tying Brett Favre for the most MVP awards in NFL history.

The day following the MVP award, the Colts faced their 2007 nemesis, the San Diego Chargers, in the Wild Card Round. Down 14–10 at the half, Manning put the Colts ahead 17–14 in the third quarter as he completed a 72-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne. However, the Chargers tied the game in the fourth quarter as kicker Nate Kaeding nailed a 22-yard field goal. When San Diego won the overtime coin toss, they scored a touchdown on the first possession, ending the Colts&#x27; season for the second consecutive season. Manning was 25 of 42 for 310 yards and a touchdown in the loss. At the end of the season, Tony Dungy retired.

====2009 season: Fourth MVP and Super Bowl XLIV appearance====
Under new head coach Jim Caldwell, Manning started the 2009 season with three consecutive wins and won AFC Offensive Player of the Month for the fourth time in his career. In week 4, against the Seattle Seahawks, Manning threw 353 yards and two touchdowns for his fourth consecutive 300-yard passing game, setting a new franchise record in the 34–17 win.

Manning helped lead the Colts to three more wins to get to a 7–0 record. Against the Houston Texans in week 9, Manning became the first quarterback to throw over 40,000 yards in a decade in the 20–17 victory. He threw a career-high 25 passes in the first quarter, which were the most in any opening quarter since 1991, and had a career-high 40 pass attempts in the first half. He set a franchise record for most 300-yard passing games in a season with his seventh 300-yard effort of the season, which was an NFL record through the first eight games of a season. In week 10, a 35–34 victory over the New England Patriots, he threw 327 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. His performance against the Patriots earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. Two weeks later, against Houston, Manning claimed his 34th comeback win in the fourth quarter, tying him with John Elway and Johnny Unitas for the second most in NFL history. In week 15 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Manning won his 23rd consecutive regular season game, breaking Jim McMahon&#x27;s NFL record of 22 straight wins with the Chicago Bears from 1984 to 1987. Despite having a perfect regular season on the line, Manning was limited in the final two games of the regular season with all clinching scenarios locked up for the Colts. The Colts dropped both games to go into the playoffs with a 14–2 record. Manning finished with 4,500 passing yards, 33 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions, which earned him second in the league in those passing categories. At the end of the regular season, Manning was awarded his fourth MVP, breaking the NFL record for most MVPs by a single player. He was also selected to the AP All-Pro team for the fifth time in his career. He finished the regular season tying his then NFL record with seven game-winning drives in 2009.

In the Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning threw two touchdown passes late in the first half to build a 17–3 halftime lead. He completed 30 passes for 246 yards in leading his eighth straight victory over the Ravens. In the AFC Championship against the New York Jets, Manning overcame a 17–6 deficit late in the second quarter to lead the Colts to 24 unanswered points in a 30–17 win. The 11-point comeback was the third largest in a conference championship game. Manning set a playoff record with his seventh 300-yard passing game in the postseason.

Facing his hometown New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV, Manning led the Colts to a 10–0 lead after their two first quarter drives, throwing a touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Garçon to cap off a 96-yard drive, which tied the longest in Super Bowl history. After running just six plays in the second quarter, the Colts led 10–6 at halftime. The Saints recovered an onside kick to start the second half and took their first lead, 13–10. Manning led a go-ahead touchdown drive to regain the lead. Leading 17–16 at the start of the fourth quarter, placekicker Matt Stover missed a 51-yard field goal for the Colts. The Saints scored the go-ahead touchdown and two-point conversion to take a 24–17 lead with 5:42 left. Manning took over and moved the Colts to the Saints&#x27; 31-yard line. Facing a 3rd and 5 with 3:24 left, his pass intended for Reggie Wayne was intercepted by Tracy Porter, who returned it 74 yards for a critical touchdown and a 31–17 Saints lead. Manning drove the Colts down to the 5-yard line in the last minute, but his 4th and goal pass was dropped by Wayne at the goal line. The Saints won their first Super Bowl in franchise history, dropping Manning to 9–9 in the postseason and a 1–1 record in the Super Bowl. Manning finished the Super Bowl with 333 passing yards on 31-of-45 attempts, one touchdown, and one interception.

====2010 season====
In a season-opening loss to the Houston Texans, Manning set career highs with 57 pass attempts and 40 completions, throwing three touchdowns and 433 yards, the fourth highest opening-weekend total ever. In his third game, Manning threw 325 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, making the first time since 1960 a quarterback began a season with three consecutive games of at least three touchdown passes and zero interceptions. In week 9, against the Philadelphia Eagles, Manning made his 200th consecutive regular season start.

In week 14, against the Tennessee Titans, he went over 4,000 passing yards for the 11th time in a season, and tied Dan Marino with his 63rd regular season game with at least 300 passing yards. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. The Colts ended up winning the AFC South for the seventh time in eight years, and Manning became the first quarterback in NFL history to lead his team to nine consecutive postseason berths. It was the 208th consecutive regular season start of his career, breaking Gene Upshaw&#x27;s record. For the season, Manning finished with an NFL-record 450 completions on 679 attempts and a career-high 4,700 passing yards. Manning&#x27;s passing yards were a franchise record until it was broken by Andrew Luck in 2014.

The Colts&#x27; season ended in a 17–16 loss to the New York Jets in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. Manning finished his last game with the Colts 18 of 26 for 225 yards and one touchdown.

On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011, he was named the second best player by his peers.

====2011 season: Last season in Indianapolis; injuries====
The Colts placed their franchise tag on Manning on February 15, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations in which he made it clear that he did not need to be the highest-paid player in the NFL.

After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning could not use the Colts&#x27; facilities for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team&#x27;s trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him in the late summer that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against the Houston Texans, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including the playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other options, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.

At any rate, he was kept on the roster without going on injured reserve, despite the fact that owner Jim Irsay did not believe that he would return to play that year. Manning started practicing throwing footballs again in mid-December, with teammate Joseph Addai even claiming his passes looked &quot;game ready.&quot; However, Manning did not play a single game in the 2011 season, and the Colts went 2–14 without him, only the third season since Manning was a rookie that the Colts did not win at least ten games.

With the Colts having the first overall pick in the upcoming 2012 draft, which contained highly rated quarterback Andrew Luck out of Stanford, and with Manning due a $28 million roster bonus, he was released on March 7, 2012. Earlier, the Colts dismissed vice-chairman Bill Polian, who in his previous capacity as general manager drafted Manning, general manager Chris Polian, and head coach Jim Caldwell as a precursor to rebuilding the team.

In an emotional press conference, Manning told Colts fans, &quot;Thank you for letting me be your quarterback.&quot; Upon his release, Irsay announced that no Colt will ever wear the No. 18 jersey again, and it was formally retired on March 18, 2016. On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012, he was ranked 50th by his peers despite not playing in the 2011 season.

===Denver Broncos===

Manning was one of the most highly sought after free agents going into the 2012 season. Several teams sought out to meet with Manning including the Miami Dolphins, the Tennessee Titans, the Arizona Cardinals, and the Denver Broncos. After visiting both the Arizona Cardinals and the Denver Broncos, Manning ultimately selected Denver after meeting with John Elway, a retired Broncos Hall-of-Famer quarterback who was now the team&#x27;s Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager, and Broncos head coach John Fox. Manning reached an agreement with the Broncos on a five-year contract worth $96 million on March 20, 2012. Although the #18 is retired in honor of quarterback Frank Tripucka, he gave Manning permission to wear it.

====2012 season====

Manning made his regular season debut as a Denver Bronco in the prime time game on the first Sunday of the 2012 season, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Manning completed 19-of-26 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions. He posted a 129.2 QB rating in the 31–19 win, and made history in the third quarter when he connected to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 71-yard touchdown pass. The touchdown was Manning&#x27;s first in the NFL with a team other than the Colts, and marked the 400th of his career, making him the third quarterback, after Dan Marino and Brett Favre, to accomplish the feat and the fastest of the three to reach that mark. In a week 6 game against the San Diego Chargers, he was 24 of 30 for 309 yards, three passing touchdowns, and one interception in the 35–24 victory. In the game, the Broncos trailed 24–0 at halftime and Manning led the Broncos to 35 unanswered points. His performance against the Chargers gave him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, his first since coming to Denver. Despite preseason concerns about his recovery, by late October, ESPN stated that Manning &quot;has silenced the critics&quot; about his arm strength. Manning was named to the 2013 Pro Bowl, his 12th. In week 17, a 38–3 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, he was 23 of 29 for 304 yards and three touchdowns to close out the regular season. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance against the Chiefs. He finished the season with 4,659 yards, 37 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. Manning set single-season franchise records for pass attempts, pass completions, passing yards, and touchdowns in the 2012 season, each of these milestones he would surpass again in 2013. 

The Broncos made the playoffs and earned a first-round bye, but lost 38–35 in double overtime in the Divisional Round to the Baltimore Ravens, who went on to win Super Bowl XLVII that season. Manning finished the game 28 of 43 for 290 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.

On February 2, 2013, Manning was awarded the AP National Football League Comeback Player of the Year Award, named a first-team All-Pro selection, and finished second in MVP voting. On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013, he was ranked as the second best player in the NFL by his peers.

====2013 season: Fifth MVP and Super Bowl XLVIII appearance====

On the opening game of the 2013 NFL season, Manning became the sixth player in NFL history and the first since 1969 to throw seven touchdowns in a game, doing so against the defending Super Bowl XLVII champions, the Baltimore Ravens. He added to this feat by not throwing an interception, tying Y. A. Tittle as one of only two players to have a 7:0 touchdown to interception ratio in a single game (although the Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; Nick Foles later matched that feat in week 9 of the same season against the Oakland Raiders). His historic performance against the Ravens gave him AFC Offensive Player of the Week Honors.

Against the Raiders in week 3, Manning broke the record for most touchdown passes in the first three games of a season after throwing 12, surpassing Tom Brady&#x27;s 2011 record. His performance against the Raiders gave him his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor in three weeks. In a week 5 win against the Dallas Cowboys, Manning threw his first interception of the season; he was intercepted by cornerback Morris Claiborne. Two weeks later, Manning returned to Indianapolis for the first time in the regular season since being released by the Colts. In an emotional pregame ceremony, the Colts showed a tribute video to Manning. In his first game back at Indianapolis, he was 29 of 49 for 386 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception but was sacked a season-high four times as the Broncos fell 39–33.

On November 24, the Broncos faced the New England Patriots. The Broncos raced out to a 24–0 lead at halftime. However, the Patriots came back and won 34–31 in overtime. In the loss, Manning had a season-low 150 passing yards to go along with two touchdowns and one interception. After the tough loss, the Broncos defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the following game by a score of 35–28. He had 403 passing yards, five touchdowns, and two interceptions in the victory. He followed that up with 397 passing yards and four passing touchdowns in the 51–28 victory over the Tennessee Titans. In week 16, against the Houston Texans, Manning broke Brady&#x27;s record for most touchdown passes in a season with 51 on a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. For the third time in the 2013 season, he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. In the week 17 season finale against the Raiders, only playing in the first half, he had 266 passing yards and four passing touchdowns to finish the season with 55 touchdown passes and a league-record 5,477 yards, breaking Drew Brees&#x27; mark by one yard. His 450 completions were at the time tied for second most all time. The Broncos scored an NFL record 606 points, becoming the first team ever to eclipse 600 points in a season.

Manning passed for at least 400 yards in a record-tying three games, matching Dan Marino&#x27;s 1984 season. They had more 50-point games in a season than any other team in NFL history, with three. Four Broncos receivers recorded at least ten touchdowns—an NFL record—and Manning set a season record with nine games with four or more touchdown passes.

His 115.1 passer rating ranks seventh all time and he joined Brady as the only two quarterbacks at the time to achieve a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in more than one season. The Broncos went on to win their Divisional Round playoff game against the San Diego Chargers by a score of 24–17. Manning finished 25 of 36 for 230 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception.

In another postseason meeting between Manning and Brady, the Broncos defeated the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship by a score of 26–16. Manning was 32-of-43 for 400 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the victory. Manning became the third starting quarterback to make the Super Bowl with two teams after Craig Morton and Kurt Warner.

In Super Bowl XLVIII, the Broncos lost to the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 43–8. Manning was up against the Seahawks&#x27; young starting quarterback Russell Wilson, who idolized Manning and attended one of Manning&#x27;s passing camps as a teenager, and later met Manning at a Broncos pre-draft interview. The Seahawks&#x27; number one ranked defense proved too much for the Broncos&#x27; number one ranked offense to overcome, while the Broncos&#x27; defense also struggled due to injuries. The Broncos&#x27; first play from scrimmage set the tone for the game. While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible, center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball too early and it flew past Manning&#x27;s head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno recovered it, but was then downed for a safety. Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLIX), but the record-setting offense did not record a first down until the second quarter, and did not score any points until the final seconds of the third quarter. While Manning threw one touchdown pass and one successful two-point conversion, he also threw two costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown by Malcolm Smith in the second quarter, who went on to win Super Bowl MVP.

On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014, he was ranked as the best player in the league by his peers.

====2014 season: NFL all-time leader in passing touchdowns====
On August 28, 2014, Manning was fined $8,268 for taunting D. J. Swearinger during a preseason game against the Houston Texans. With the Broncos&#x27; 31–24 win in their opening game of the 2014 NFL season against the Colts, Manning became, along with Brett Favre, only one of two starting quarterbacks in NFL history to have beaten all 32 teams. Two weeks later was a Super Bowl XLVIII rematch with the Seattle Seahawks. Despite the 26–20 overtime loss, Manning had 303 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and one interception by Kam Chancellor as the Broncos fared better than in the previous year&#x27;s Super Bowl. On October 5, 2014, in a stellar performance against the Arizona Cardinals, Manning threw for a career-high 479 passing yards, tied his career-high with an 86-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas, threw his 500th career touchdown pass to Julius Thomas, and tied Dan Marino for the most 400-yard games by a quarterback in a 41–20 victory over the previously undefeated Cardinals.

On October 19, 2014, against the San Francisco 49ers on &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, Manning threw his 509th career touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas, passing Brett Favre to become the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in passing touchdowns. His historic touchdown was part of a 318-yard, four-touchdown passing performance where he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the 27th and final time in his career. Overall, he finished the 2014 season with 4,727 passing yards, 39 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. At the end of the regular season, Manning was selected to his 14th Pro Bowl appearance, which at the time tied him with Tony Gonzalez, Bruce Matthews, and Merlin Olsen for most Pro Bowl selections in a career. The Broncos finished with a 12–4 record and earned a first-round bye. However, his season ended after the Broncos lost in the Divisional Round of the playoffs to his former team, the Colts, 24–13. Manning finished 26-for-46 for 211 yards and a touchdown. However, he went just 7-for-18 (38.9%) in the first half, his lowest completion percentage in a first half of any game since 2007. For Manning, the loss was the ninth time he went one-and-done in the postseason. After the season ended, the Broncos and head coach John Fox parted ways. On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015, he was ranked as the fifth best player by his peers.

====2015 season: Final season and Super Bowl 50 championship====

After much speculation, Manning announced in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL, this time under his fifth head coach, Gary Kubiak. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning&#x27;s play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-six by cornerback Aqib Talib and late interception by Darian Stewart aided the Broncos in their 19–13 victory. On November 1, against the Green Bay Packers, he finished with a season-high 340 passing yards and an interception in the dominant 29–10 victory. The Broncos got off to a dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 27–24. During that winning streak and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, throwing over 250 yards and nine touchdowns in six of the seven games. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense for victories.

In week 10, in the second divisional game against Kansas City, the game&#x27;s biggest highlight was Manning breaking Brett Favre&#x27;s record for career passing yards with a four-yard pass to running back Ronnie Hillman in the first quarter. Despite the accomplishment, however, Manning went 5-for-20 for 35 yards and four interceptions with a 0.0 passer rating before Kubiak benched him during the third quarter. Brock Osweiler filled in for Manning for the rest of the game as the Broncos lost 29–13. Manning&#x27;s record lasted until the 2018 season when Drew Brees broke it in week 5 against the Washington Redskins. A day later, sources said that Manning suffered a bout of plantar fasciitis. It was later announced that the injury would keep him out of week 11, making it the first time he missed a game in a season he played. Osweiler replaced Manning and performed well in a 17–15 win over the Chicago Bears, leading to questions about whether Manning would keep his role when healthy in a week 12 showdown against the New England Patriots. The next day, Kubiak, citing Manning&#x27;s injuries, announced that Osweiler would start against New England. On December 15, it was announced that Osweiler would make his fifth consecutive start, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, even though Manning returned to practice and the Broncos went seven straight quarters without scoring a touchdown on offense. The Broncos were 4–2 in six games without Manning, giving them an 11–4 record heading into the final week of the regular season.

On December 27, 2015, Al Jazeera America released a report conducted by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit investigating professional athletes&#x27; use of Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) which named Manning, among other prominent athletes, as having received illegal drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011. In July 2016, the NFL cleared Manning of the allegations after it found no evidence to support the claims.

Manning was listed as active for the week 17 regular season finale against the San Diego Chargers, but for the first time since his freshman year at college, he was listed as a backup. In the third quarter, with the Broncos down 13–7, Manning entered the game in relief of Osweiler, who was intercepted twice and fumbled once. He and the Broncos went on to beat the Chargers, 27–20, to secure the AFC West and top seed in the AFC. Despite the Broncos&#x27; 12–4 record (and Manning&#x27;s 8–2 record in games that he played in), Manning had the worst season statistically of his career, as he threw a career-low nine touchdown passes and 17 interceptions in just 10 games, and posted a quarterback rating of 67.9, which was the lowest rating of his career, and the first time he had a rating below 84 since his rookie season. Manning&#x27;s 59.8 completion percentage was the second lowest of his career, only behind his rookie season. Manning&#x27;s 17 interceptions were second to Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles, who threw 18 interceptions but started all 16 games.
The Broncos, by virtue of having the AFC&#x27;s #1 seed, earned home-field advantage throughout the NFL playoffs. The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Round by a score of 23–16 to advance to the AFC Championship game to host the defending Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots. Manning was 21-of-37 for 222 with no touchdowns or interceptions in the win over the Steelers. The AFC Championship game was the 17th, and ultimately final, meeting between Manning and his longtime rival Tom Brady. Despite a late comeback attempt from the Patriots, the Broncos won 20–18 to advance to Super Bowl 50. Manning had 176 passing yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions in the win.

On February 7, 2016, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers 24–10 in Super Bowl 50 as the Broncos&#x27; defense shut down the favored Panthers&#x27; top-ranked offense and regular season MVP Cam Newton. The game set a record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years; Manning was 39 and Newton was 26 (the record has since been surpassed twice). Manning finished the game 13-of-23 for 141 yards and one interception while being sacked five times, scoring his only passing points with 3:08 left in the fourth quarter when he connected with wide receiver Bennie Fowler for a two-point conversion, which ended up being the final pass of his career. Manning became the oldest starting quarterback to both play in and win a Super Bowl at age 39, until Tom Brady surpassed the record at age 41 in Super Bowl LIII and again at age 43 in Super Bowl LV. Manning also became the first quarterback to start in two Super Bowls each with multiple franchises under different head coaches each time (Dungy, Caldwell, Fox, and Kubiak) and the first quarterback to lead two franchises to a Super Bowl victory. The victory gave Manning his 200th overall win including regular season and playoffs, making him the starting quarterback with the most combined regular season and postseason wins in NFL history. Brady has since surpassed Manning&#x27;s record in 2016.

===Retirement===

Manning announced his retirement, after 18 seasons, on March 7, 2016. The last words of his retirement speech were, &quot;I&#x27;ve fought a good fight. I&#x27;ve finished my football race and after 18 years, it&#x27;s time. God bless all of you and God bless football.&quot; After 18 seasons in the NFL, Manning received the 2016 ESPY Icon Award. He won a total of nine ESPY Awards during his career.

On October 7, 2017, in a ceremony attended by hundreds of fans, the Colts unveiled a bronze statue of Manning outside its Lucas Oil Stadium. Manning was inducted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor and was the first player to have his jersey retired by the Colts since they moved to Indianapolis. In 2019, Manning was named to the NFL 100 All-Time Team.

On February 6, 2021, Manning was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, with the committee taking only 13 seconds to debate his selection. On June 9, 2021, Manning was unanimously elected to the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame. Manning was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8, 2021, and the Broncos Ring of Fame on October 31, 2021. Peyton, along with Eli, were named to the 2022 SEC Football Legends Class.

===&quot;The Manning Bowl&quot;===
Peyton and Eli Manning played against each other three times in the regular season during their professional careers. These encounters were colloquially dubbed &quot;The Manning Bowl&quot;, and Peyton&#x27;s teams, twice with the Colts and once with the Broncos, held a 3–0 record over Eli and the New York Giants. The first Manning Bowl was held on September 10, 2006, and Peyton&#x27;s Colts defeated Eli&#x27;s Giants by a score of 26–21. The second Manning Bowl was held on September 19, 2010, with Peyton and the Colts beating Eli&#x27;s Giants again by a score of 38–14. The third and final Manning Bowl was held on September 15, 2013, and Peyton and the Broncos beat Eli&#x27;s Giants 41–23. They faced each other in two Pro Bowls, in 2009 and 2013, both won by the NFC. However, they never faced each other in the playoffs as both always played in separate conferences and never made the Super Bowl at the same time.

==Personal life==

Manning was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the second son of Olivia (née Williams) and former NFL quarterback Archie Manning. His younger brother is two-time Super Bowl Champion Eli Manning. Some have described the Mannings as football&#x27;s &quot;royal family.&quot;

Manning married his wife, Ashley, in Memphis on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 2001. A graduate of the University of Virginia, Ashley was introduced to him by her parents&#x27; next-door neighbor the summer before Manning&#x27;s freshman year in college. The couple has twins: a son, Marshall Williams, and a daughter, Mosley Thompson, who were born on March 31, 2011. They live in Denver, Colorado. Upon his arrival in Denver, Manning temporarily lived in a house owned by Mike Shanahan until purchasing his own home for $4.575 million.

Manning is a Presbyterian Christian. At age 13, he said, &quot;I committed my life to Christ, and that faith has been most important to me ever since.&quot; Manning said his priorities ranked in order are &quot;...faith, family, friends, and football.&quot; Manning said he prays every night and before games and added, &quot;I hope (and pray) I don&#x27;t do too many things that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you&#x27;re committed to God in that way.&quot;

Manning reportedly memorized the Colts&#x27; playbook within a week after being drafted, and in 2012, he was able to precisely recall the details and timing of a specific play that he used at Tennessee 16 years earlier.

During the summer, Archie, Peyton, Eli, and oldest sibling Cooper run the Manning Passing Academy, a five-day camp that aims to improve the offensive skills of quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, and running backs. In addition to the Mannings, the camp has included many prominent football players as coaches, such as Colts wide receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.

Manning, along with his father Archie, co-authored a book titled &quot;Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy&quot;, which was released in 2000. The book covers Archie&#x27;s and Cooper&#x27;s lives and careers, and Manning&#x27;s life and career up to the time that the book was released, and examines football from both Archie&#x27;s and Manning&#x27;s points-of-view. Manning wrote about Jamie Ann Naughright, who accused him of sexual harassment, stating that she had a &quot;vulgar mouth.&quot; He described his conduct toward her as &quot;crude, maybe, but harmless.&quot; Naughright sued for defamation, resulting in an undisclosed settlement in 2003 and a court order imposing a condition on both Manning and Naughright preventing them from ever talking about the settlement or each other again.

Mark Kiszla, a sports columnist for the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, in a column about Manning&#x27;s future plans, said that Manning&#x27;s net worth &quot;is estimated to be in excess of $150 million&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s not enough money to buy an NFL franchise by himself, although an ownership group that included Manning as president with a financial stake in the team would be led by a brilliant football mind.&quot; He has donated over $8,000 to Republican politicians, among them Fred Thompson, Bob Corker, and former President George W. Bush. During the 2016 presidential race, Manning contributed to the campaign of Jeb Bush. On October 26, 2012, Manning bought 21 Papa John&#x27;s Pizza stores, all in Colorado. He sold his shares of the stores in February 2018.

During his professional career, Manning earned the nickname, &quot;the Sheriff&quot;. The nickname had its origin traced to a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast in 2009 when analyst Jon Gruden described Manning&#x27;s ability to use audibles at the line of scrimmage on the road.

In honor of Manning, the University of Tennessee offers a Peyton Manning Scholarship to incoming freshmen.

===Other work===
Manning has been credited with helping to improve the city of Indianapolis. A curator at the Indiana State Museum stated that &quot;There is no Super Bowl held here without Peyton. There is no Lucas Oil Stadium without Peyton. Without Peyton, the Colts would probably be in L.A. right now.&quot; He became one of the NFL&#x27;s most marketable players, appearing in several television and printed advertisements for some of the NFL&#x27;s biggest sponsors.

On March 24, 2007, his 31st birthday, Manning hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (season 32, episode 16). His brother Eli also hosted the show five years later. The episode earned the show&#x27;s highest household rating in more than 10 months in the metered markets. He appeared on &quot;SNL&quot; again in 2008, the &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot; in 2015, and on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; on the January 29, 2022, episode hosted by Willem Dafoe.

On May 27, 2007, Manning waved the green flag to begin the 91st Indianapolis 500. On February 18, 2018, he drove the pace car during the 2018 Daytona 500. Before the latter, he made a guest appearance on &quot;Fox NASCAR&quot; pre-race show alongside race pole-sitter and fellow Nationwide Insurance spokesman Alex Bowman.

In 2009, Manning guest voiced (with his brothers Eli and Cooper) on an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; called &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot; in which Bart dreams of having a baby brother and sees famous brothers like The Marx Brothers, The Blues Brothers, The Wright Brothers, The Mario Brothers, and The Manning Brothers. He also voiced Guapo in the 2017 movie &quot;Ferdinand&quot;.

Manning hosted the 2017 ESPY Awards on July 12, 2017.

Manning is the host of &quot;Peyton&#x27;s Places&quot;, a documentary series about football on ESPN+, in which Manning interviews players, coaches, and celebrities. The series was renewed for a third season in December 2020. The series is produced by Manning&#x27;s own production studio, Omaha Productions. Through the studio, Manning also serves as a producer on the sports documentary series &quot;Quarterback&quot; and &quot;Full Court Press&quot;.

In 2021, Peyton hosted a revival of the quiz show &quot;College Bowl&quot;, with his brother Cooper as his &quot;sidekick&quot;. The series was renewed in 2022 for a second season.

In 2021, Peyton and Eli began hosting an alternative broadcast of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; called the &quot;Manningcast&quot; on ESPN2 and ESPN+. The show features segments with special guest stars from entertainment, politics, and sports while the Manning brothers watch and commentate on the game.

Manning has also expressed interest in becoming a potential owner of the Denver Broncos.

In 2023, it was announced Manning would join the University of Tennessee as a professor in the College of Communication and Information.

===Philanthropy===

Shortly after beginning his NFL career, Manning started his own charity called the Peyback Foundation. The Peyback Foundation&#x27;s mission is to help disadvantaged kids, and focuses its efforts in Louisiana, Tennessee, Indiana, and Colorado. For his work with the foundation, Manning received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, which is given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

Manning, along with his brother Eli, volunteered their assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Among the tasks performed, the Mannings assisted in the delivery of 30,000 pounds of water, Gatorade, baby formula, diapers, and pillows to the people of New Orleans.

In September 2007, St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis renamed its children&#x27;s hospital to Peyton Manning Children&#x27;s Hospital at St. Vincent. Manning and his wife made a donation of an undisclosed amount to St. Vincent&#x27;s and have a relationship with the hospital since he came to Indianapolis.

In 2022, the Peyback foundation teamed up with Georgia Tech to launch a scholarship in honor of Manning&#x27;s former Broncos teammate Demaryius Thomas. The foundation also launched scholarships at six historically black colleges and universities.

In 2024, Manning was honored with the Mizel Institute Community Enrichment Award.

<doc id="429836" wikidata="Q1092177" url="?curid=429836" title="Message-oriented middleware">
<text>Message-oriented middleware (MOM) is software or hardware infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between distributed systems. Message-oriented middleware is in contrast to streaming-oriented middleware where data is communicated as a sequence of bytes with no explicit message boundaries. Note that streaming protocols are almost always built above protocols using discrete messages such as frames (Ethernet), datagrams (UDP), packets (IP), cells (ATM), et al. 

MOM allows application modules to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols. The middleware creates a distributed communications layer that insulates the application developer from the details of the various operating systems and network interfaces. Application programming interfaces (APIs) that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.

This middleware layer allows software components (applications, servlets, and other components) that have been developed independently and that run on different networked platforms to interact with one another. Applications distributed on different network nodes use the application interface to communicate. In addition, by providing an administrative interface, this new, virtual system of interconnected applications can be made fault tolerant and secure.

MOM provides software elements that reside in all communicating components of a client/server architecture and typically support asynchronous calls between the client and server applications. MOM reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master-slave nature of the client/server mechanism.

==Middleware categories==
*Remote procedure call or RPC-based middleware
*Object request broker or ORB-based middleware
*Message-oriented middleware or MOM-based middleware

All these models make it possible for one software component to affect the behavior of another component over a network. They are different in that RPC- and ORB-based middleware create systems of tightly coupled components, whereas MOM-based systems allow for a loose coupling of components. In an RPC- or ORB-based system, when one procedure calls another, it must wait for the called procedure to return before it can do anything else. In these mostly synchronous messaging models, the middleware functions partly as a super-linker, locating the called procedure on a network and using network services to pass function or method parameters to the procedure and then to return results. Note that Object request brokers also support fully asynchronous messaging via oneway invocations.

==Advantages==
Central reasons for using a message-based communications protocol include its ability to store (buffer), route, or transform messages while conveying them from senders to receivers.

Another advantage of messaging provider mediated messaging between clients is that by adding an administrative interface, you can monitor and tune performance. Client applications are thus effectively relieved of every problem except that of sending, receiving, and processing messages. It is up to the code that implements the MOM system and up to the administrator to resolve issues like interoperability, reliability, security, scalability, and performance.

===Asynchronicity===
Using a MOM system, a client makes an API call to send a message to a destination managed by the provider. The call invokes provider services to route and deliver the message. Once it has sent the message, the client can continue to do other work, confident that the provider retains the message until a receiving client retrieves it. The message-based model, coupled with the mediation of the provider, makes it possible to create a system of loosely coupled components.

MOM comprises a category of inter-application communication software that generally relies on message-passing, as opposed to a request-response architecture. In asynchronous systems, message queues provide temporary storage when the destination program is busy or not connected. In addition, most asynchronous MOM systems provide persistent storage to back up the message queue. This means that the sender and receiver do not need to connect to the network at the same time (asynchronous delivery), and problems with intermittent connectivity are solved. It also means that should the receiver application fail for any reason, the senders can continue unaffected, as the messages they send will simply accumulate in the message queue for later processing when the receiver restarts.

===Routing===
Many message-oriented middleware implementations depend on a message queue system. Some implementations permit routing logic to be provided by the messaging layer itself, while others depend on client applications to provide routing information or allow for a mix of both paradigms. Some implementations make use of broadcast or multicast distribution paradigms.

===Transformation===
In a message-based middleware system, the message received at the destination need not be identical to the message originally sent. A MOM system with built-in intelligence can transform messages and route to match the requirements of the sender or of the recipient. In conjunction with the routing and broadcast/multicast facilities, one application can send a message in its own native format, and two or more other applications may each receive a copy of the message in their own native format. Many modern MOM systems provide sophisticated message transformation (or mapping) tools which allow programmers to specify transformation rules applicable to a simple GUI drag-and-drop operation.

==Disadvantages==
The primary disadvantage of many message-oriented middleware systems is that they require an extra component in the architecture, the message transfer agent (message broker). As with any system, adding another component can lead to reductions in performance and reliability, and can also make the system as a whole more difficult and expensive to maintain.

In addition, many inter-application communications have an intrinsically synchronous aspect, with the sender specifically wanting to wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see real-time computing and near-real-time for extreme cases). Because message-based communication inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations. That said, most MOM systems have facilities to group a request and a response as a single pseudo-synchronous transaction.

With a synchronous messaging system, the calling function does not return until the called function has finished its task. In a loosely coupled asynchronous system, the calling client can continue to load work upon the recipient until the resources needed to handle this work are depleted and the called component fails. Of course, these conditions can be minimized or avoided by monitoring performance and adjusting message flow, but this is work that is not needed with a synchronous messaging system. The important thing is to understand the advantages and liabilities of each kind of system. Each system is appropriate for different kinds of tasks. Sometimes, a combination of the two kinds of systems is required to obtain the desired behavior.

==Standards==
Historically, there was a lack of standards governing the use of message-oriented middleware that has caused problems. Most of the major vendors have their own implementations, each with its own application programming interface (API) and management tools.

One of the long-standing standards for message oriented middleware is X/Open group&#x27;s XATMI specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XATMI Specification) which standardizes API for interprocess communications. Known implementations for this API is ATR Baltic&#x27;s Enduro/X middleware and Oracle&#x27;s Tuxedo.

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an approved OASIS and ISO standard that defines the protocol and formats used between participating application components, so implementations are interoperable. AMQP may be used with flexible routing schemes, including common messaging paradigms like point-to-point, fan-out, publish/subscribe, and request-response (these are intentionally omitted from v1.0 of the protocol standard itself, but rely on the particular implementation and/or underlying network protocol for routing). It also supports transaction management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous multi-platform support. Java applications that use AMQP are typically written in Java JMS. Other implementations provide APIs for C#, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other programming languages.

The High Level Architecture (HLA IEEE 1516) is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) standard for simulation interoperability. It defines a set of services, provided through an API in C++ or Java. The services offer publish/subscribe based information exchange, based on a modular Federation Object Model. There are also services for coordinated data exchange and time advance, based on logical simulation time, as well as synchronization points. Additional services provide transfer of ownership, data distribution optimizations and monitoring and management of participating Federates (systems).

The MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) supported by the OASIS organization. It provides a lightweight publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport protocol on top of TCP/IP suitable for communication in M2M/IoT contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

The Object Management Group&#x27;s Data Distribution Service (DDS) provides message-oriented Publish/Subscribe (P/S) middleware standard that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high performance and interoperable data exchanges between publishers and subscribers. The standard provides interfaces to C++, C++11, C, Ada, Java, and Ruby.

=== XMPP ===
The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services. Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations&#x27; implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license; although many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software, many freeware and proprietary software implementations also exist. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions. XMPP-based software is deployed widely across the Internet, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation, and forms the basis for the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Capabilities Framework.

The Java EE programming environment provides a standard API called Java Message Service (JMS), which is implemented by most MOM vendors and aims to hide the particular MOM API implementations; however, JMS does not define the format of the messages that are exchanged, so JMS systems are not interoperable.

A similar effort is with the actively evolving OpenMAMA project, which aims to provide a common API, especially to C clients. As of August 2012, it is mainly appropriate for distributing market-oriented data (e.g. stock quotes) over pub-sub middleware.

==Message queuing==

Message queues allow the exchange of information between distributed applications. A message queue can reside in memory or disk storage. Messages stay in the queue until the time they are processed by a service consumer. Through the message queue, the application can be implemented independently - they do not need to know each other&#x27;s position, or continue to implement procedures to remove the need for waiting to receive this message.

==Trends==
* Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) provides an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.
* The Object Management Group&#x27;s Data Distribution Service (DDS) has added many new standards to the basic DDS specification. See Catalog of OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) Specifications for more details.
* The Object Management Group&#x27;s Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) has added many new standards recently including a new language mapping to C# and an update to the IDL to C++ mapping specification to support the latest updates to the C++ language standards. See Catalog of OMG CORBA Specifications for more details.
* Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on Extensible Markup Language (XML).
* Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), formerly named TTMP, is a simple text-based protocol, provides an interoperable wire format that allows STOMP clients to talk with any Message Broker supporting the protocol.
* An added trend sees message-oriented middleware functions being implemented in hardware, usually in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other specialized silicon chip.

<text>Société Calédonienne de Transports Aériens, trading as Air Calédonie, is the domestic airline of the French collectivity of New Caledonia. Its headquarters are on the grounds of Magenta Airport in the territory&#x27;s capital of Nouméa, from which it operates scheduled passenger and cargo flights to domestic destinations. The airline is collectively owned by the Government of New Caledonia (52.45%), the Loyalty Islands Province (26.21%), the North Province (14.55%), the South Province (5.16%), private investors (1.10%), and Air France (0.53%).

== History ==
=== 1954–1968: Startup as Transpac ===
On 9 December 1954, Henri Martinet, Herbert Coursin, Louis Eschembrenner, Tom Johnston and Walter Hickson, a group of aviation enthusiasts, founded the airline as Transpac, which was the first airline of New Caledonia. The aim was to create an airline service between Nouméa and the mainland and the surrounding islands.

The company&#x27;s first aircraft landed on 9 August 1955 at La Tontouta. The twin-engine, fabric-covered aircraft was a de Havilland Dragon Rapide DH 89 and could carry eight passengers. The Dragon Rapide&#x27;s inaugural flight took place on 28 September 1955 to Maré and Lifou from Nouméa. Services to the Isle of Pines and Ouvéa began in October 1955. After one year in business, Transpac had transported 5,057 passengers with using only one aircraft. In February 1958, Transpac purchased the de Havilland Heron DH 114, a 17-seater aircraft. The aim was to meet the needs of increasing local traffic. The company bought three of these aircraft in succession with the strategy of developing a regional network, especially to the New Hebrides.

On 9 February 1961, financial support was granted to Transpac&#x27;s Board of Directors by the regional government, and Transpac was renamed to Air Calédonie.

=== 1968–1992: The arrival of turbine-powered aircraft ===
The increase in traffic led to fleet renewal as of 1968. The company chose twin turboprops as these aircraft were larger, more modern, and reliable. In 1968, the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter was the first turbine-powered aircraft to arrive in Air Calédonie&#x27;s fleet. It was a 19-seater and was equipped with more reliable technology and was more powerful than piston-powered aircraft. Nine-seater Britten Norman Islanders were added to the growing fleet. In 1969, The New Caledonian Territorial government became the majority shareholder during a major refinancing operation.

By the end of 1980, Air Calédonie had transported a total of 100,000 passengers during the year. In 1986, Air Calédonie&#x27;s first ATR 42 turboprop landed in Magenta. It was a new-generation, 46-seater aircraft and Air Calédonie was one of the first airlines to operate it. Two more ATR 42 were purchased in 1988 and 1990 to develop inter-island services. The ATR 42 was well suited to the airline&#x27;s network and enabled the company to promote tourism on the mainland and to the islands.

Two Dornier 228 were added to the fleet in 1990, the aircraft of which could travel twice as fast as the Twin Otter with an identical capacity of 19 seats. The Dorniers were considered highly cost-efficient aircraft to the airline, and unlike the ATR, could land on short runways. The ATR 42 were replaced by two new aircraft; one was purchased in 1993 and the other in 1997.

=== 1992–2004: Traffic increase ===
At the beginning of the 1990s, the company was faced with liquidity problems following large fleet renewal investments and several social crises. A managing board was therefore set up in July 1992. This was controlled by a supervisory board with the aim of regaining financial stability. The construction of the new Magenta airport was launched.

The management and supervisory boards were created in July 1992 and dissolved in 2004. The management board&#x27;s main task was to create a recovery plan which would increase the company&#x27;s profit margins whilst simultaneously meeting customers&#x27; needs. In 1998, Air Calédonie invested in the extension of Magenta airport due to increasing traffic. This was finished in two phases between 2000 and 2001. By the end of 2000, the company had transported 300,000 passengers during the year.

=== 2005–2014: Constant development ===
In 2005, the board of directors launched a tax-exemption project to purchase new ATR and replace the older ATR 42-300. The company chose one 48-seater ATR 42-500 and two 70-seater ATR 72-500s. In 2012, the company was awarded the IOSA certification, which enabled it to become an IATA member in November 2013. A fourth ATR was added to Air Calédonie&#x27;s fleet in 2014.

The ATR 42-500 and the first ATR 72-500 were delivered to the airline in 2006, while a second ATR 72-500 was delivered in 2007. These three aircraft were decorated in the company&#x27;s new livery, consisting of yellow and orange colors with bamboo-engraved totem patterns.

In March 2012, Samuel Hnepeune became president of Air Calédonie&#x27;s board of directors, before being made company chief executive officer in September 2013. A vast company restructuring plan followed.

Air Calédonie reached a total of 400,000 transported passengers between March 2013 and March 2014, with a load factor rate of 82%. In January 2014, the management and unions signed a social pact after fourteen months of negotiations. The company had operated with no company agreement for 19 years as the previous had been abandoned in 1995. In March 2014, the company&#x27;s fourth ATR, an ATR 72-500, was delivered to the airline, with the total investment in the ATR fleet worth 1.1 billion euros. The aircraft was financed for the most part by a loan but also with the help of the Adanc (New Caledonia Air Service Agency). The new ATR 72-500 enabled a traffic increase of almost 35% across the airline&#x27;s network.

<doc id="429838" wikidata="Q3182307" url="?curid=429838" title="John Porteous (soldier)">
<text>Captain John Porteous ( – 7 September 1736) was a Scottish military officer who served in the Edinburgh City Guard and played a major role in the Porteous Riots, which resulted in his death. 

==Early life==
John Porteous was born at The Glen, Quair Water, near Traquair, in the Borders, the son of Stephen Porteous, a tailor of the Canongate, Edinburgh. Little is known of his early life, except that he soon found he was not suited to his father&#x27;s calling. Having served in the Scots Brigade in the Dutch Republic, in 1716 he became drill master to the Edinburgh force in anticipation of a Jacobite rising, and two years later was appointed as ensign to the City Guard, and was promoted in 1726 to the rank of captain. Porteous seems to have been an overbearing official, despised by the mob and the underclasses of Edinburgh society.

In 1724 he lost a wager of 20 guineas in playing a game of golf on Leith Links against Alexander Elphinstone, the brother of Lord Balmerino. The wager attracted a small crowd, including the Duke of Hamilton and George Douglas.

==Riot==
On 14 April 1736, three convicted smugglers, Andrew Wilson, William Hall and George Robertson, were arrested, tried and condemned to death. Hall&#x27;s sentence was commuted to transportation for life, while Wilson and Robertson awaited their fate. A few days before the execution George Robertson was enabled by Wilson to escape from his guards while attending a service in St Giles&#x27;, shouting &quot;Run Geordie, run&quot; as he held two officers and clamped his teeth onto the collar of a third. With the help of sympathetic supporters George Robertson eventually made his way to the Dutch Republic.

The remaining convict, Andrew Wilson, was taken to be publicly hanged in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh, on 14 April 1736. His body was cut down against the wishes of the mob, and the ensuing riot was such that the hangman had to be placed in protective custody. As the situation worsened, for fear of an attempt to rescue the victims, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh instructed Porteous to call out the entire guard and to furnish them with powder and shot.

After the execution, the mob became violent and began to stone the City Guard. Accounts of events are confused, but what is certain is that Porteous instructed his men to fire above the heads of the crowd, but in so doing, they wounded people in the windows of the high tenement buildings opposite. The crowd became increasingly violent and, as panic set in, Captain Porteous ordered the guard to shoot into the mob, which led to the deaths of six people in all.

==Trial and appeal==
Porteous was arrested the same afternoon and charged with murder. He was tried at the High Court of Justiciary on 5 July 1736, where a majority of witnesses testified that Porteous had personally fired into the crowd on 14 April, although sixteen others said they had not seen him do so. Feelings were running high in Edinburgh and the jury unanimously found Porteous guilty of murder. He was sentenced to death, the execution was set to take place in the Grassmarket on 8 September 1736. Porteous was imprisoned in the Tolbooth prison, near St Giles church.

Events in Scotland alarmed government officials in London, and Sir Robert Walpole attempted to influence events by asking his representative in Edinburgh to become involved. But he had miscalculated, underestimating the depth of feeling in Scotland. A formal appeal was petitioned and the execution was deferred.

==Death==

However, public resentment at a possible reprieve was such that a plot to murder Captain Porteous was hatched, and when the authorities heard of this, it was decided to increase the guard at the Tolbooth prison. However, on the evening before this was due to happen, a large crowd of over four thousand gathered at Portsburgh, west of the city.

Making their way across the Grassmarket to the Cowgate and up the High Street, the mob converged on the Tolbooth, where they were eventually able to overpower the guards. Porteous was dragged from his cell and up the Lawnmarket towards the West Bow and the Grassmarket, where he was lynched from a dyer&#x27;s pole, using a rope taken from a local draper&#x27;s shop. After a short while, he was dragged down and stripped of his nightgown and shirt, which was then wrapped around his head before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again. He died a short while later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736.

The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket. The site of the Tolbooth is marked by paving stones arranged in the form of a heart, &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot;. Tour guides will say that, even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth.

Porteous was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, on 9 September, near the westmost wall of the original graveyard. For more than two hundred years, the grave was marked by a small square stone with the single letter &quot;P&quot; and the date 1736. In 1973, this was replaced with a headstone of Craigleith stone, bearing the inscription &quot;John Porteous, a captain of the City Guard of Edinburgh, murdered September 7, 1736. All Passion Spent, 1973&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The events in Edinburgh heightened the sense of alarm in London, where the government was concerned about the threat to its management of Scotland. It was thought by Walpole, Queen Caroline and the Duke of Newcastle that Porteous had been unnecessarily sacrificed and there were even rumours that the conspiracy had involved the local city magistrates.

Various Opposition proposals to disband the city guard and debar the Lord Provost were put forward, and these were the subject of much debate – the Scottish MPs and the government strongly opposed these proposals for constitutional reasons, and nothing was ever done.

It was variously thought that Porteous&#x27; murder was carried out by friends of those who had been shot and killed, revenge by the smugglers, a Jacobite plot, or even a conspiracy by Presbyterian extremists. However, the organisation of events seems to imply a degree of planning, thought to be the work of James Maxwell, an Edinburgh journeyman carpenter, together with a small group of city tradesmen and journeymen. Despite a reward of £200 offered by the government for information, those responsible for the murder of Porteous were never brought to justice.

The events surrounding the Porteous Riots form part of the early chapters of the novel &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian&quot; by Sir Walter Scott (1818), where they are recorded in graphic detail.

==Porteous and golf==
John Porteous had been an early exponent of the game of golf. It is recorded that in 1724, &quot;A solemn match of golf: between the Hon. Alexander Elphinstone and John Porteous became the first match to be reported in a newspaper. Both players were said to have exhibited great skill, and such was the interest in the match that it was attended by James, Duke of Hamilton and George, Earl of Morton, as well as a large crowd of spectators. The wager was twenty guineas, with Elphinstone winning the match.

<doc id="429839" wikidata="Q1813958" url="?curid=429839" title="Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is a non-ministerial government department of the Government of the United Kingdom that investigates and prosecutes serious or complex fraud and corruption in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The SFO is accountable to the Attorney General for England and Wales, and was established by the Criminal Justice Act 1987, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 grants the SFO powers to require any person (or business/bank) to provide any relevant documents (including confidential ones) and answer any relevant questions including ones about confidential matters. The SFO is the principal enforcer of the Bribery Act 2010, which has been designed to encourage good corporate governance and enhance the reputation of the City of London and the UK as a safe place to do business. Its jurisdiction does not extend to Scotland, where fraud and corruption are investigated by Police Scotland through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.

==History==
===Formation of the unit===

During the 1970s and early 1980s a series of financial scandals in the City of London destroyed the public&#x27;s trust in the way serious or complex frauds were handled. In response to this the Government established the Fraud Trials Committee in 1983. This independent committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Roskill, considered how changes to the law and criminal proceedings could lead to more effective ways of fighting fraud. The committee report, commonly known as the Roskill Report was published in 1986. Its main recommendation was to set up a new, unified organisation responsible for detecting, investigating and prosecuting serious fraud cases. As a result, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and its unique powers were created by the Criminal Justice Act 1987, &quot;an Act to make further provision for the investigation of and trials for fraud; and for connected purposes&quot;. It opened for business in April 1988. The SFO also enforces the Bribery Act 2010.

===Al-Yamamah investigation===
The Al-Yamamah arms deal during the 1980s was a large scale aircraft and weapons deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia. It was extended throughout the 1990s and saw thousands of British citizens living and working in Saudi Arabia representing £40 billion worth of business. BAE Systems Plc was the primary contractor. In 2004 the SFO began to investigate the contracts within the al-Yamamah deal on the grounds of suspected false accounting, but the investigation was controversially dropped in 2006. The decision was made following concerns about national security amidst reports that the Saudi Government would stop sharing counterterrorist information with the UK if the investigation continued. This drew criticism from number of sources, not least from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). A High Court review in 2008 ruled that the SFO had acted unlawfully by dropping the corruption investigation but this was later overturned on appeal by the SFO to the House of Lords.

===Comparison to New York===
In 2008, an official internal &quot;Review of the Serious Fraud Office&quot;, which was conducted by a former senior New York City prosecutor, compared the SFO unfavourably with two of its counterparts in New York City: the offices of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the New York County District Attorney. It found that the American prosecutors obtained higher conviction rates in a shorter amount of time with fewer resources. It also found that the SFO had significantly lower conviction rates than elite divisions of the British Crown Prosecution Service. It attributed the SFO&#x27;s relatively poor performance to, among other things, failure to keep all court advocacy &quot;in-house&quot;, failure to assign each case a single lawyer who managed it &quot;from cradle to grave&quot;, failure to interview witnesses at an early stage, and failure to co-operate closely with the police.

===2010s===
While Home Secretary, Theresa May expressed that she wanted the National Crime Agency (NCA) to absorb the SFO. While the SFO is supervised by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office, the NCA is overseen by the Home Office. From around 2005 to 2017, the SFO underwent a series of budget cuts.

On 18 May 2017, the Tories released a manifesto pledging to dismantle the Serious Fraud Office and roll it into the NCA if they won the general elections in June 2017. The manifesto claimed that the incorporation would &quot;strengthen Britain&#x27;s response to white collar crime by... improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime.&quot;

==Notable cases==
===Guinness share-trading fraud===

In 1986 there were rumours that the Guinness Brewery takeover of the Distillers Company was tainted by an unlawful share support operation which involved Guinness offering secret indemnities (from its own funds) against losses to people &#x27;supporting&#x27; the bid which resulted in a dramatic rise in the price of Guinness shares.

Having examined the bid, the SFO opened an investigation which led to the conviction in 1990 of the then chief executive of Guinness and three other defendants.

===BAE Systems weapons sales to Saudi Arabia===

Al Yamamah is the name of a series of a record arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. In 2006, an investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office into the deal was discontinued after political pressure from the Saudi and British governments.

===BAE Systems radar sale to Tanzania===

In 1999 British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd agreed a contract with the Government of Tanzania for the supply of a radar defence system. A local businessman in Tanzania was recruited to advise BAE on its negotiations with the Government on the radar contract.

Between January 2000 and December 2005 around $12.4 million was paid to the local businessman&#x27;s two companies. BAE has accepted that there was a high probability that part of this sum would be used to favour it in the contract negotiations with the Tanzanian Government.

The payments were not subject to proper and adequate scrutiny or review and BAE Systems Plc was subsequently fined £500,000 after admitting that it had failed to keep adequate accounting records of the defence contract with the Government of Tanzania. This outcome followed a settlement by BAE, as part of a global agreement reached in 2010 with the Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice, concerning contracts in a number of countries. The settlement with the SFO relates to the Tanzanian contract. The terms of the settlement include an agreement by BAE to pay an &quot;ex-gratia&quot; sum (£30 million less any fine imposed by the Crown Court) for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. BAE was also ordered to pay £225,000 costs to the SFO.

===Barclays emergency fundraising===
In June 2017, John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath were charged with offences regarding Barclays&#x27;s raising of £11.8 billion in emergency funds. The fraud was alleged to have taken place around the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

===Abbas Gokal &amp; the BCCI===

The BCCI Bank was a Luxembourg-registered bank that collapsed in 1992. It was discovered by the bank&#x27;s auditors, that the bank was running on loss for many years. It was reported that the bank was involved in drug-trafficking, money-laundering and phony loans. The key player in the collapse was Pakistani shipping magnate Abbas Gokal. It was discovered that Gokal&#x27;s company, Gulf Shipping Lines, had received a US$1.2 billion unsecured loan from the bank. When the bank collapsed and the scandal emerged, Gokal escaped to Pakistan, but since the United Kingdom and Pakistan had no extradition treaty, he could not be extradited to the UK to stand trial.

However, when Gokal was making a trip to America in 1994, his plane stopped for re-fueling in Frankfurt. There, German police arrested him and extradited him to the United Kingdom. He was handed a 14-year sentence as a result of the SFO prosecution, the longest sentence handed out in a British court for fraud.

===Mykola Zlochevsky===
In April 2014, the SFO launched a money laundering investigation against Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. Accounts of Burisma Holdings and its parent Brociti Investments, controlled by Zlochevsky, were frozen at the London branch of BNP Paribas. That money US$23 million was transferred as a result of complex transactions by a company controlled by a Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Kurchenko, a subject of the European Union restrictive measures. When the Ukrainian prosecutor general&#x27;s office failed to provide documents needed for the investigation, a British court in January 2015 dropped the case and ordered the assets be unfrozen.

==Organisation==
As one of the Law Officers&#x27; Departments, the SFO reports to the Attorney General for England and Wales. The SFO is unique in that its role is to both investigate and prosecute. Its case teams are therefore made up of investigators, lawyers, law clerks and forensic accountants. The SFO employs around 500 people. The cost of running the SFO in the financial year 2010–11 was 64p for each member of the British public. Over 80 per cent of staff are specialist caseworkers. When deciding what action to take, lawyers in the SFO must bear in mind the Prosecutors Code.

The SFO is not a police force and its own investigators are not constables. Although the SFO does have certain investigatory powers, it does not have the powers of arrest or police powers in relation to search. Therefore, if these powers are necessary for an investigation the SFO will request support from the police or NCA as necessary.

==Activities and responsibilities==
The SFO is a specialist organisation that investigates only the most serious types of economic crime. As a result, a potential case must meet certain criteria before it is taken on. In deciding, the Director will take into account all the circumstances of the case and consider:
* cases which undermine British commercial/financial PLC in general and the City of London in particular;
* cases where the actual or potential loss involved are high;
* cases where actual or potential harm is significant;
* cases where there is a very significant public interest element; and
* new species of fraud

The Serious Fraud Office&#x27;s jurisdiction does not extend to Scotland where fraud and corruption are investigated by Police Scotland through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.

===Fraud===
The SFO investigates and prosecutes fraud. The SFO prosecutes different types of fraud, including investment fraud. Among the types of investment fraud prosecuted are boiler room fraud (share scams), which is an operation, usually run from abroad, where scammers typically cold-call people and use hard-sell tactics to sell shares that prove worthless, are inflated in price, or don&#x27;t exist. The SFO cites Vintage Wines of St Albans as an example of a successful boiler room fraud prosecution. The SFO also prosecutes the investment schemes called &#x27;Ponzi&#x27; or pyramid schemes, which typically involves an investment offer which promises to provide an abnormally higher rate of return. In a Ponzi scheme, a single operator benefits, while in a pyramid scheme, many investors benefit from recruiting other investors. The SFO has cited the KF Concept case as an example of one of its successful ponzi scheme prosecutions, where a banker was jailed for 10 years for running an unauthorized investment business and defrauding investors of amounts over £17 million.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK has received an additional £9.3 million from the government to enhance its capabilities in addressing complex fraud and corruption. This funding aims to improve the agency&#x27;s resources and operational efficiency, particularly in light of concerns regarding its effectiveness in handling high-profile cases that have resulted in failed prosecutions.
Critics have raised issues about delays and inefficiencies in the SFO&#x27;s investigations, which can impede successful outcomes. The increase in funding is intended to help the SFO respond more effectively to serious financial crimes. There are ongoing discussions about the need for more substantial long-term support to ensure that the SFO can adequately fulfill its mandate and tackle the rising threats posed by financial crime and corruption in the UK.

The SFO also prosecutes multiple types of corporate fraud. The SFO website as of 2013 outlined several types of fraud it classified as corporate, including asset stripping, which involved company directors taking company funds or assets of value while leaving behind the debts. Other types of prosecuted corporate fraud include fraudulent trading, where a company carries on a business for any fraudulent purposes. An example of a successful SFO prosecution for fraudulent trading is the InterGB group, the collective name for a number of companies that, between 1996 and 2000, extracted more than £85 million from three financial institutions by submitting false invoices. The chairman of the group was jailed for seven years. Also prosecuted is &#x27;share ramping&#x27;, also known as &#x27;pump and dump&#x27; or &#x27;book ramping&#x27;, is where criminals influence the share price of a company and then take advantage of the price fluctuations. Publishing false information is also prosecuted as corporate crime. According to the SFO, this is usually done to mislead investors and creditors and to keep a failing company trading.

===Bribery and corruption===
According to the SFO, corruption is where the integrity of a person, Government, or company is manipulated and compromised for personal gain. SFO classifies and prosecutes two main types of corruption. It defines political corruption as the dysfunction of a political system or institution in which government officials, political officials or employees look for illegitimate personal gain through actions such as bribery, extortion, cronyism, patronage and embezzlement. It defines corporate corruption as where, for example, bribes are offered to agencies, institutions or individuals in order to win a contract. It brought up Innospec Limited, manufacturers of a fuel additive, as an example of a successful prosecution for corporate corruption.

===Self-reporting===
The SFO encourages self-reporting of fraud. Azizur Rahman, senior partner at law firm Rahman Ravelli has provided further guidance on internal investigations of alleged bribery and the potential leniency benefits of self-reporting, although he notes that the SFO will still investigate: they will not simply take a company&#x27;s self-report &quot;at face value&quot;.

===Overseas assistance===
The SFO has a dedicated International Assistance team which regularly assists law enforcement agencies worldwide with their investigations. In 2010–11 the SFO assisted over 30 different jurisdictions.

===Victim support===
According to the SFO, victims are at the core of its strategy. They include any person, organisation, or Government both in the UK and abroad, which has suffered direct financial loss from the most serious and complex fraud, or corruption.

The SFO tries to get justice for victims by recovering as much recompense as possible for victims. In April 2011, £64 million of funds were, or were due to be returned to victims. The average jail sentence handed out in SFO cases was 56 months in 2010-11. For example, in 2011 three fraudsters running the online Xclusive ticket fraud (that failed to deliver tickets to the Beijing Olympics and various music festivals) each received prison sentences of up to eight years. The SFO started confiscation proceedings to recover money for victims.

==Recent Investigations==
The SFO launched an investigation into the collapsed law firm Axiom Ince in 2023. This case involved allegations of £66 million in missing client money and resulted in significant action by the SFO. In January 2023, the agency conducted searches at three premises across England, leading to three arrests. The SFO continues to actively pursue assets from convicted fraudsters. In October 2024, the agency successfully recovered £295,000 from Virendra Rastogi&#x27;s hidden pension funds. This recovery was part of an ongoing proceeds of crime investigation that has yielded nearly £6 million to date, including the sale of Rastogi&#x27;s Marylebone home and seizure of valuable assets. In November 2024, the SFO received an additional £9.3 million in funding from the government. This investment aims to strengthen the agency&#x27;s capacity to recover criminal assets, expand its use of technology for disclosure purposes, and improve its case management system. The SFO&#x27;s work frequently involves cross-border investigations, highlighting the international nature of many financial crimes. The agency maintains cooperation with international partners, as evidenced by its collaboration with the Australian Federal Police in the Rio Tinto case. 

In December 2024, five former members of national firm Axiom Ince have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office with offences including fraud, forgery and the destruction of documents relating to the collapse of the firm and the alleged misuse of client money.

==Ongoing Challenges==
Despite these developments, the SFO continues to face challenges in handling high-profile cases. The agency has experienced setbacks, including the collapse of some prosecutions, which has led to scrutiny of its effectiveness in complex financial crime cases. These recent activities and developments demonstrate the SFO&#x27;s continued efforts to adapt and strengthen its capabilities in the fight against serious fraud and financial crime. 

==Criticism==
The SFO, which reports to the Attorney General&#x27;s Office, has over time repeatedly faced attempts by politicians to roll it into a broader crime-fighting body. In December 2021 the Court of Appeal criticised the SFO with regards to their handling of the Unaoil case for ‘wholly inappropriate’ contacts with a ‘fixer’, for which the agency had already been criticised, as well as &quot;serious&quot; disclosure failures undermining a defendant&#x27;s right to a fair trial. Three court of appeal judges overturned the conviction of a businessman because of the watchdog&#x27;s misconduct. In July 2020, His Honour Judge Beddoe had rebuked SFO director Lisa Osofsky over &quot;flattering&quot; texts from a US-based private investigator who was seeking to secure more favourable sentences for his clients. The judge criticised Osofsky for making herself &quot;vulnerable to &quot;flattery&quot; following inappropriate contact with private investigator David Tinsley and said the SFO&#x27;s contact with him should be &quot;comprehensively reviewed to see what lessons can be learned from it&quot;.

The decision came months after the trial of two Serco executives charged with fraud collapsed because of SFO disclosure errors. In a written statement after his acquittal, Mr Marshall said. &quot;It is clear to me that I was prosecuted, not as a result of a fair assessment of the evidence, but because I was collateral damage in the deal that was done by Serco with the SFO.&quot; Judge said the SFO took the view that issues identified had &quot;undermined the process of disclosure in this case to the extent that the trial cannot safely and fairly proceed&quot;.

The cases raised serious questions about the SFO&#x27;s approach. The Justice Committee launched a new inquiry to investigate the criminal justice system&#x27;s approach to combatting fraud. The Committee examined the approach of the Serious Fraud Office to combatting economic crime and responding to the challenges of Brexit and the pandemic. It also examined what lessons have been learnt from recent high-profile cases, as well as addressing concerns over evidence disclosure, staff culture and victim support (in March and October 2022).

The office of the attorney general issued a statement saying Suella Braverman was &quot;deeply concerned about the findings in the judgment&quot;. The attorney general then launched a &quot;forensic and robust&quot; probe in to the failings at the Britain&#x27;s main anti-corruption agency. The Attorney General, Suella Braverman stated: &quot;I announced this review on the day of the judgment as it was clear to me that swift action was needed. We must ensure lessons are learned so that the failings we saw in the Unaoil case can never happen again.&quot;

In February 2022, the SFO became subject to an inquiry by the UK Public Accounts Committee, which monitors state spending, as the collapse of the so-called &quot;Serco case&quot; caused serious financial harm to the SFO budget. SFO director Lisa Osofsky appeared before the committee to explain a £2.55m overspend in 2020/21, which was the result of the failed prosecution of two former directors of Serco.

This led to public debate about possible future of SFO and its leadership. In June 2022 it was announced that the &quot;forensic and robust review&quot; commissioned by the Attorney General which was conducted by Sir David Calvert-Smith was delayed. On 21 July 2022 the review was published. Osofsky commented on the report as a: &quot;sobering read&quot;. The review was criticizing the conduct of SFO head: &quot;It is clear that Osofsky was faced with a difficult situation very early in her tenure and made a number of mistakes and misjudgments which, with the benefit of hindsight, she now accepts.&quot; Calvert-Smith said further that Osofsky &quot;was not supposed to be personally involved in contact&quot; with a fixer, who had no recognised legal role in the so-called Unaoil case.

Calvert-Smith&#x27;s review paints a picture of chaotic management of the Unaoil case and a &quot;toxic&quot; relationship between staff and senior management within the SFO. A &quot;damaging culture of distrust&quot; between the case team and senior managers developed, the review said. The review found some failings in the case involved &quot;cultural issues within the SFO&quot;, such as noncompliant record keeping, &quot;failure to comply with its disclosure obligations&quot;, &quot;inadequate resourcing of the case&quot;, &quot;DSFO using her personal mobile phone and failing to take contemporaneous notes of meetings and conversations&quot; and a &quot;lack of understanding of priorities between the case team and senior management&quot;, amplified by the impression that a U.S. fixer had the &quot;seal of approval&quot; from the director and, caused in part by the suspension and unfair and wrongful dismissal of the Unaoil case controller, Tom Martin was suspended in July 2018. In February 2021, the judge concluded that Tom Martin&#x27;s complaints of unfair dismissal and breach of contract were &quot;well founded&quot;. In July 2022, SFO lost its appeal over unfair sacking of Martin.

Emily Thornberry MP, Labour&#x27;s Shadow Attorney General, stated on the report that it &quot;lays bare a catalogue of woeful mismanagement and inexplicable misjudgements at the top of the SFO&quot;. In direct reference to Osofsky Thornberry said the SFO&#x27;s leadership had shown &quot;gullibility and arrogance&quot; in their dealings with a &quot;fixer&quot;, she tweeted on 21 July. She stated further &quot;It is vital that the Attorney General not only commits to implement Sir David&#x27;s recommendations in full, but asks herself whether the senior managers at the SFO whose failures are exposed in this report are really the individuals best placed to repair the damage. Earlier this year Thornberry tweeted: &quot;The Unaoil debacle is not a one-off.&quot;

Brian Altman KC was commissioned by the SFO to review the Serco case. He noted there had been &quot;systemic problems of real concern&quot; in relation to the SFO&#x27;s disclosure in that case, including that the appointed officer&#x27;s &quot;inexperience should have disqualified him from appointment as disclosure officer on such a large and complex case&quot;. The Serious Fraud Office has not referred any lawyers to the Solicitors Regulation Authority over the collapse of a high-profile criminal trial, MPs heard in February 2022. The SFO must prevent third parties having &quot;direct access&quot; to the watchdog&#x27;s director and ensure all prosecutions have an &quot;effective disclosure strategy&quot;, Calvert-Smith&#x27;s review into the calamitous Unaoil bribery case recommended – as a third man jailed after the investigation had his name cleared. These stinging defeats for the SFO have &quot;left the entire Unaoil case on shaky ground&quot;.

According to the Spotlight on corruption, Serco and Unaoil &quot;botched disclosures raise concerns about whether there are more systemic problems in the SFO’s strategy and conduct of high-stakes cases.&quot; The blame for three quashed convictions in the Unaoil bribery case and the midtrial collapse of another case against two Serco executives is both institutional and individual. Both cases were sunk by the SFO&#x27;s failure to properly disclose evidence to the defense. The reports found the SFO struggled to keep adequate records, failed to properly oversee case progression and failed to carry out disclosure checks, and that its key staff were too inexperienced to handle the process. Both Brian Altman&#x27;s KC review into the collapse of the R v Woods and Marshall trial and Sir David Calvert-Smith&#x27;s review into the SFO&#x27;s handling of the Unaoil investigation exposed the scale of the agency&#x27;s problems and challenges. Susan Hawley, executive director at anti-corruption charity Spotlight on Corruption, said: &quot;Both the Calvert-Smith and the Altman reviews point to similar and very serious underlying issues behind the SFO’s spate of collapsed trials.&quot;

The UK&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office spent £16.2 million on its corruption investigation into the oil consultancy Unaoil, with nearly a third allocated to external legal fees. The investigation faced significant challenges, including the quashing of three bribery convictions due to non-disclosure of evidence and the collapse of a fourth trial. 

===Conflicts between SFO and private interests===
In August 2022, Lisa Osofsky stated that she was proud of a &quot;revolving door&quot; between the regulator and private firms as fears grew that movement of senior figures into private sector would transfer inside knowledge into companies, which were subject to investigations. Among the individuals criticized for moving from senior positions in the SFO to private law firms were Sir David Green, the SFO&#x27;s former director, two of its former general counsels, four former heads or co-heads of its bribery and corruption divisions, two former heads of its fraud division and the former heads of its assurance and international assistance divisions.

In November 2021, in her letter: &quot;SFO’s revolving door works better than a closed shop&quot; published by the Financial Times Osofsky said that they &quot;advocate for the interchange of personnel. It has always happened and long may it continue. It grows the collective capability of our organisation more than a closed shop ever could.&quot; She noted that they already use one, &quot;much to our advantage. In short, we advocate for the interchange of personnel,&quot; and that &quot;our relatively modest budget doesn’t prevent us from delivering&quot;.

In March 2023, &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine, a UK-based widely recognized news and current affairs publication edited by Ian Hislop, revealed that SFO chief Lisa Osofsky has been forced to disclose further information about her recusal from three separate investigations. &quot;Private Eye&quot; wrote that the SFO&#x27;s 2021 annual report revealed that Lisa Osofsky recused herself from three investigations; Barclays bank, Harlequin properties, and a third unnamed investigation. Media noted that none of Osofsky&#x27;s predecessors had ever needed to recuse themselves from live investigations. After &quot;Private Eye&quot; sent a Freedom of Information request about the nature of the recusals and advice given to Osofsky, the SFO said that it would not disclose details about what Osofsky&#x27;s links were to the investigations. Media highlighted the clear conflict of interest in Osofsky&#x27;s decision to reject disclosure under the FOI request, and commented that the whole affair remains &quot;unexplained and unsatisfactory&quot;.

<text>Claudie (André-Deshays) Haigneré (; born 13 May 1957) is a French doctor, politician and former astronat. She was the first female astronaut of the French space agency CNES and the European Space Agency (ESA) to go to space.

== Background and training ==
Born in Le Creusot, Claudie Haigneré studied medicine at the Faculté de Médecine (Paris-Cochin) and Faculté des Sciences (Paris-VII). In addition to her medical degree, she went on to obtain certificates in biology and sports medicine (1981), aviation medicine and space medicine (1982), and rheumatology (1984). In 1986, she received a diploma in the biomechanics and physiology of movement and received her doctorates in rheumatology (1984) and neuroscience (1992).

== Space career ==
In 1985, France&#x27;s space center selected only six men and one woman—Claudie Haigneré—to go to space. She first served as a back-up crew member for the 1993 Mir &quot;Altaïr&quot; mission, in which her future husband Jean-Pierre Haigneré participated. The asteroid 135268 Haigneré is named in their combined honour. 

In 1994, Claudie Haigneré began training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, for the Franco-Russian Cassiopeia mission and learned Russian during her time there. On 17 August 1996, she became the first French woman to go to space when she and two Russian cosmonauts, commander Valery Korzun and flight engineer Aleksandr Kaleri, launched into space aboard the Soyuz TM-24. While on the mission, Haigneré visited the Mir space station for 16 days, where she conducted comprehensive experiments in the fields of physiology and developmental biology, fluid physics and technology. 

In 1999, Haigneré commanded a Soyuz capsule during reentry and became the first woman qualified to do so. As the flight engineer on Soyuz TM-33 in 2001, she became the first European woman to visit the International Space Station. After the mission, Haigneré continued her involvement in space science by attending scientific workshops and conferences. She also contributed to data analysis and constructions for the scientific programs of future projects. She eventually retired from ESA on 18 June 2002.

== Political career ==
Following her career as an astronaut, Haigneré entered French politics in Jean-Pierre Raffarin&#x27;s government. She was minister delegate for Research and New Technologies from 2002 to 2004 and succeeded Noëlle Lenoir as minister delegate for European Affairs from 2004 to 2005.

== Organizational involvement ==
During her spaceflight in 1996, Haigneré agreed to a request from Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse, that she be the honorary patron of the Cité de l’espace scientific discovery centre. She attended the opening of the centre with Baudis on 27 June 1997. As of January 2025, she still holds this role. 

In 2009, Haigneré was named as the founding director of Universcience. Universcience brought together Europe&#x27;s largest science museum, the Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie, with the Palais de la Découverte museum. At that time, she was an advisor to the Director General of the ESA. Haigneré held the role of Director of Universcience until 2015, at which point she resumed serving as a special advisor to ESA&#x27;s Director General.

In 2018, Haigneré agreed to chair the jury of the DStv Eutelsat Star Awards, which is an annual pan-African student competition in which students write an essay or create a poster focusing on science and technology fields as a source of inspiration to unlock opportunities for Africa. The essays and posters will then be judged by an international panel of industry experts, government and academic world members, based on accuracy, creativity, originality and innovation. Haigneré&#x27;s acceptance of this assignment marked the first time a woman has served on the panel for the DStv Eutelsat Star Awards.

== Honours ==

Haigneré received many honors during her career. She received the Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur as well as the Chevalier of the Ordre National du Mérite. To recognize her outstanding involvement in the Franco-Russian space cooperation, she received the Russian Order of Friendship. She also received the Russian Medal For Merit in Space Exploration and Medal for Personal Valour.

Haigneré is also an honorary member of the Société Française de Médecine Aéronautique et Spatiale and the Association Aéronautique et Astronautique de France (AAAF). She also holds membership in the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and of the Académie de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace (ANAE).

There are streets named after her in the French towns of Claira, Franqueville-Saint-Pierre, Marignane, Mudaison and Valliquerville.

<text>The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), branded as UK Export Finance (UKEF), is the export credit agency and a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom.

In 1920, UKEF had a maximum total exposure of just £26 million. Today, its maximum commitment stands at £50 billion.

==Activities==

ECGD derives its powers from the (c. 67) and undertakes its activities in accordance with specific consent from HM Treasury. ECGD was established in 1919 to promote UK exports, lost during the submarine blockade of World War I. 

ECGD&#x27;s aim is to benefit the UK economy by helping exporters of UK goods and services to win business, and UK firms to invest overseas by providing guarantees, insurance and reinsurance against loss, taking into account HM Government&#x27;s wider international policy agenda. ECGD is required by the HM Government to operate slightly better than break even, by charging premiums from exporters at levels that match the perceived risks and costs in each case.

The largest part of ECGD&#x27;s activities involves underwriting long-term loans to support the sale of capital goods, principally for the export of aircraft, bridges, machinery, and services; it helps UK companies take part in major overseas projects such as the construction of oil and gas pipelines and the upgrading of hospitals, airports, and power stations. Support can be given for contracts as low as £1,000, but some of the projects ECGD backs go well beyond the £1 billion mark.

As part of its risk management process, ECGD has to make a judgement on the ability of a country to meet its debt obligations. The department uses a &quot;productive expenditure&quot; test, undertaken in consultation with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, that makes sure that the countries defined as heavily indebted poor countries and those exclusively dependent on International Development Association financing only get official export credits from the UK for projects that help social and economic development without creating a new unsustainable debt burden. ECGD continues to check that the proposed borrowing is sustainable.

ECGD&#x27;s short term credit business was sold to Dutch insurer NCM Group in 1991, later becoming part of Atradius in 2004.

==Criticisms of ECGD==
The ECGD has been the subject of criticism by UK-based NGOs; The Corner House has claimed that the ECGD has in effect provided public subsidy for bribery; Campaign Against Arms Trade has argued that the ECGD provides excessive levels of support for arms sales; Jubilee Debt Campaign has argued that the cancellation of debts owed to the ECGD should not be counted towards UK Official Development Assistance figures; World Wide Fund for Nature argues that excessive greenhouse gases are emitted from ECGD-supported projects and that this is inconsistent with wider UK environmental policy.

In recent years, the ECGD has been heavily criticised for prioritising investment in fossil fuels over renewable energy. A CAFOD report showed that from 2010 to 2017, an estimated 97% of ECGD energy-related support went to fossil fuel development, principally oil and gas exploration and production in upper-middle-income countries. Just 3% went to renewables. The Guardian reported that in the 2018–2019 financial year alone, ECGD committed nearly £2 billion in support to fossil fuel projects across the world. A parliamentary inquiry called on ECGD to stop funding fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021, citing that the scale of fossil fuel support violated the UK&#x27;s obligations under the Paris Agreement.

==Weapons exports==
While in the early years of the decade, the proportion of ECGD&#x27;s business in support of weapons exports ranged from 30% to 50%, this has now declined to under 1% in 2009–10.

ECGD seeks advice on arms sales from the United Kingdom Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the Department for Business and Trade. All applications are assessed, on a case-by-case basis, against the consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing criteria.

The ECO&#x27;s advice is not always followed by the government, though. In February 2016, the head of the Export Control Organisation, Edward Bell, advised Business Secretary Sajid Javid that Britain should suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. This advice was not followed by the business secretary and prime minister.

==ECGD&#x27;s anti bribery-and-corruption procedures==
ECGD aims to:

* deter illegal payments, corrupt practices and money laundering by applicants for ECGD&#x27;s support; and
* ensure, as far as is practicable, that all transactions that ECGD supports do not place ECGD in breach of any UK or European legislation or place the UK in contravention of any international agreements to which the UK is a party.

It does this through the public information it provides and the declarations in its application forms; it has some powers to make inquiries but these are limited. CGD does not have a formal investigative capacity.

Key aspects of ECGD&#x27;s anti-bribery and corruption procedures are to:

* Require applicants to provide copies of their codes of conduct and to confirm that they have applied them in tendering for the award of the contract for which ECGD&#x27;s support is sought;
* Obtain information with a view to ascertaining whether any improper payments involving agents have been made;
* Inspect, if necessary, exporters&#x27; documents relating to winning contracts and making payments to agents;
* Remind applicants of their obligations to comply with UK anti-corruption legislation;
* Remind applicants that ECGD will refer all allegations of bribery, corruption or money laundering to the appropriate authorities;
* Require applicants to declare that neither they nor any of their directors have admitted to, or been convicted of, engaging in any form of bribery or corruption;
* Require applicants to disclose whether they, or anyone acting on their behalf, is under charge in a UK court for bribery of a foreign public official;
* Require each applicant to make reasonable enquiries concerning any of its subsidiary companies, agents or consortium partners who, in each case, are involved in the contract for which ECGD&#x27;s support is sought and to confirm that, on the basis of those reasonable enquiries, the applicant has no cause to believe that any of those parties, or any of their directors, has admitted to, or been convicted of, engaging in any corrupt activity; and
* Require each applicant to confirm that neither the applicant nor anyone acting on the applicant&#x27;s behalf has engaged in corrupt activity in relation to the contract for which ECGD&#x27;s support is sought.

<text>The British Council is a British organisation specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. It works in over 100 countries: promoting a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language (and the Welsh language in Argentina); encouraging cultural, scientific, technological and educational cooperation with the United Kingdom. The organisation has been called a soft power extension of UK foreign policy, as well as a tool for propaganda.

The British Council is governed by a Royal Charter. It is also a public corporation and an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB), sponsored by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Its headquarters are in Stratford, London. Its chair is Paul Thompson and its chief executive is Scott McDonald.

==History==
*1934: British Foreign Office officials created the &quot;British Committee for Relations with Other Countries&quot; to support English education abroad, promote British culture and fight the rise of fascism. The name quickly became the British Council for Relations with Other Countries.
*1936: The organisation&#x27;s name was officially shortened to the British Council.
*1938: The British Council opened its first four offices in Bucharest (Romania), Cairo (Egypt), Lisbon (Portugal) and Warsaw (Poland). The offices in Portugal are currently the oldest in continuous operation in the world.
*1940: King George VI granted the British Council a Royal Charter for promoting &quot;a wider knowledge of [the United Kingdom] and the English language abroad and developing closer cultural relations between [the UK] and other countries&quot;.
*1942: The British Council undertook a promotion of British culture overseas. The music section of the project was a recording of significant recent compositions by British composers: E.J. Moeran&#x27;s Symphony in G minor was the first work to be recorded under this initiative, followed by recordings of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, Bliss&#x27; Piano Concerto, Bax&#x27;s Third Symphony, and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;.

*1944: In August, after the liberation of Paris, Austin Gill was sent by the British Council to reestablish the Paris office, which soon had tours by the Old Vic company, Julian Huxley and T. S. Eliot.
*1946: The British Council collected handicraft products from crafts that were being practised in the British countryside for an &quot;Exhibition of Rural Handicrafts from Great Britain&quot; that travelled to Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the collection was sold to the Museum of English Rural Life in 1960 and 1961.
*1948: The British Council sponsored a tour by the Old Vic Theatre Company to Australia and New Zealand. The cast was led by Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, performing a repertoire of three plays: Richard III, The School for Scandal, and Skin of Our Teeth. In Australia, the company gave 179 performances and were seen by over 300,000 people. The tour made a profit of about £40,000.
*1984: Kenneth Whitty, Deputy Director of the British Council in Athens, was murdered by militants from the Abu Nidal Organisation.
*2007: The Russian Foreign Ministry ordered the British Council to close its offices outside Moscow. The Ministry alleged that it had violated Russian tax regulations, a move that British officials claimed was retaliation over the British expulsion of Russian diplomats allegedly involved with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. This caused the British Council to cease carrying out all English-language examinations in Russia in January 2008. In early 2009, a Russian arbitration court ruled that the majority of the tax claims, valued at $6.6 million, were unjustified.
*2011: On 19 August, a group of armed men attacked the British Council office in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing at least 12 people – none of them British – and temporarily took over the compound. All the attackers were killed in counter-attacks by forces guarding the compound. The British Council office was relocated to the British Embassy compound, as the British Council compound was destroyed in the suicide attack.
*2013: The British Council in Tripoli, Libya was targeted by a car bomb on the morning of 23 April. Diplomatic sources were reported as saying that &quot;the bombers were foiled as they were preparing to park a rigged vehicle in front of the compound gate&quot;. The attempted attack was simultaneous with the attack on the French Embassy in Tripoli on the same day that injured two French security guards, one severely, and wounded several residents in neighbouring houses. A jihadist group calling itself the Mujahedeen Brigade was suspected, possibly linked to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.

== Organisation ==
The British Council is a charity governed by Royal Charter. It is also a public corporation and an executive nondepartmental public body (NDPB), sponsored by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Its headquarters are in Stratford, London. Its chair is Paul Thompson, and its CEO is Scott McDonald.

The British Council&#x27;s total income in 2014–2015 was £973 million principally made up of £154.9 million grant-in-aid received from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; £637 million income from fees and teaching and examinations services; and £164 million from contracts.

The British Council works in more than 100 countries: promoting a wider knowledge of the UK and the English language; encouraging cultural, scientific, technological and educational understanding and cooperation; changing people&#x27;s lives through access to UK education, skills, qualifications, culture and society; and attracting people who matter to the future of the UK and engaging them with the UK&#x27;s culture, educational opportunities and its diverse, modern, open society.

In 2014–2015, the British Council spent: £489 million developing a wider knowledge of the English language; £238 million encouraging educational cooperation and promoting the advancement of education; £155 million building capacity for social change; £80 million encouraging cultural, scientific and technological cooperation; and £10 million on governance, tax and trading expenses.

During the COVID-19 pandemic the British Council took a £200 million rolling emergency loan from the government at commercial interest rates, requiring annual renewal. In 2025, this loan was seen as risk to the financial stability of the council.

== Notable activities ==

===English and examinations ===
The British Council offers face-to-face teaching in more than 80 teaching centres in more than 50 countries.

Three million candidates took UK examinations with the British Council in more than 850 towns and cities in 2014–2015.

The British Council jointly runs the global IELTS English-language standardised test with Cambridge University Press and Assessment and IDP Education Australia. Over 2.5 million IELTS tests were delivered in 2014–2015.

====Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)====
In 2014, the British Council launched its first MOOC, Exploring English: Language and Culture, on the UK social learning platform FutureLearn. This was accessed by over 230,000 people.

====English for peace====
&quot;Peacekeeping English&quot; is a collaboration between the British Council, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Ministry of Defence to improve the English-language skills of military personnel through the Peacekeeping English Project (PEP). PEP is helping train approximately 50,000 military and police service personnel in 28 countries, amongst them Libya, Ethiopia and Georgia.

===Mobility programmes ===

====Education UK====
In 2013, the British Council relaunched the global website Education UK for international students interested in UK education. The site receives 2.2 million visitors per year and includes a search tool for UK courses and scholarships, advice and articles about living and studying in the UK.

====Erasmus+====
From 2014 to 2020, the British Council and Ecorys UK jointly administered almost €1 billion of the €14.7 billion Erasmus+ programme offering education, training, youth and sports opportunity for young people in the UK. It was expected that nearly 250,000 people will have undertaken activities abroad with the programme.

===Schools===

====Connecting Classrooms====
Over 16,000 schools have taken part in an international school partnership or benefited from teacher training through the British Council Connecting Classrooms programmes.

===Universities===
====RENKEI network====
The RENKEI network, established in 2012, brings together universities from Japan and the UK. RENKEI stands for &quot;Research and Education Network for Knowledge Economy Initiatives&quot; in English and means &quot;collaboration&quot; in Japanese. the members are the universities of Durham, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle and Southampton from the UK and Keio, Kyushu, Ritsumeikan and Tohoku universities from Japan.

===Arts and culture===
====ACCELERATE====
ACCELERATE was a leadership programme for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the creative arts, run jointly by the British Council and the Australia Council in partnership with Australian state arts agencies, between 2009 and 2016. During that time, 35 people participated in the programme, with many alumni going on to excel in their fields.

==== UK-India Year of Culture ====

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II hosted the official launch of the UK-India Year of Culture on 27 February 2017 at Buckingham Palace, with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley representing Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The British Council worked with the Palace and British-Indian start-up Studio Carrom to project a peacock, India&#x27;s national bird, onto the facade of Buckingham Palace.

====fiveFilms4freedom====
In 2015, the British Council launched fiveFilms4freedom, a free, online, 10-day LGBT film festival with the British Film Institute, supported by the UN Free &amp; Equal campaign. It was the first global online LGBT film festival. The festival runs a 24-hour campaign to ask people to watch a movie and show that love is a human right. In 2016, films were viewed by over 1.5m people in 179 countries.

====Shakespeare Lives====
In October 2015, the British Council announced a global programme with the BBC, British Film Institute, the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Shakespeare 400 consortium, the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe to celebrate Shakespeare&#x27;s life and work on the 400th anniversary of this death.

====&quot;Selector Radio&quot;====
&quot;Selector Radio&quot; is a weekly two-hour radio show, produced by Audio Always for the British Council. Originally launched in 2001, the show is now broadcast in more than 30 countries around the world, connecting a global audience to a wide range of music the United Kingdom has to offer, covering a variety of genres from grime, indie, soul, dance and more. The show features interviews, guest DJ mixes and exclusive live sessions from some of the UK&#x27;s most exciting artists. It avoids many mainstream acts, in favour of emerging talent and underground styles. It has an estimated listenership of over four million people. The show is currently hosted in the UK by Sian Eleri since 2024 - previous hosts include Jamz Supernova, Goldierocks and Andrea Oliver – and many countries take the English language version of the show and create a new show from the tracks and features, translating the &#x27;links&#x27; into the local language.

=== Cultural and educational exchange with North Korea ===
The British Council has been running a teacher training programme in North Korea since 2001. In July 2014 the British Council signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) for cultural and educational exchange.

==Other activities==

=== Young Creative Entrepreneur Awards ===
The British Council&#x27;s Young Creative Entrepreneurs Awards identify and support talented people from across the creative industries, such as the International Young Publisher of the Year, International Young Design Entrepreneur of the Year, International Young Music Entrepreneur of the Year and British Council West Africa Arts Programme ~ Creative Entrepreneurs 2018 awards.

== Controversies ==

=== British Council and the Indian Diaspora Effect ===
The British Council has faced criticism for outsourcing key functions, including teacher recruitment, to a shared services centre in Noida, India. Concerns have been raised over the influence of the Indian diaspora in shaping policy, with key figures such as Sanjay Patel (Chief People Officer), Vijay Doshi (Chief Financial Officer, formerly held by Bidesh Sarkar), and Sushil Saluja (Trustee, Chair of the Commercial Committee) in senior roles.

Critics question whether this ‘living bridge’ has led to political blind spots on human rights, as outsourcing continues despite India’s documented rights abuses under the BJP. The decision to outsource coincides with MPs Virendra Sharma and Navendu Mishra holding vice-chair roles in both the British Council and India Trade APPGs, raising transparency concerns. Moreover, the issue gained further prominence when Rishi Sunak visited the British Council’s New Delhi centre in 2023; just two years after the British Council had sold its IELTS business in India.

Critics warn that growing reliance on Indian corporate partnerships, such as Tata’s takeover of British Council services, risks prioritising cost-cutting over human rights and British cultural diplomacy.

=== Shared Services in India ===
In 2024, the &quot;EL Gazette&quot; highlighted the British Council’s outsourcing of teacher recruitment and other administrative operations to Uttar Pradesh, India, as previously reported in &quot;The Times&quot;. &quot;The EL Gazette&quot; report raised concerns about cultural and operational missteps, including poor communication, language proficiency issues, and bureaucratic inefficiencies stemming from the Council’s shared services centre in Noida. These challenges were detailed in an unearthed GSD Strategy paper, seen by the publication, which documented significant service shortcomings over several years.

=== Taiwan Teachers Vote on Historic Strike Over Stagnant Pay ===
British Council teachers in Taiwan were set to vote on historic strike action over stagnant pay, unchanged since 2004 despite a 25% rise in inflation and a significant increase in student fees. &quot;EL Gazette&quot; reported that teachers argue recent below-inflation pay increments fail to address the issue, despite the Council&#x27;s claim of offering competitive packages. Dissatisfaction is further fuelled by comparisons to better-paid roles in local international schools.

=== British Council&#x27;s Handling of Afghan Teachers Post-2021 ===
The British Council faced criticism for leaving behind over 100 Afghan teachers during the Taliban&#x27;s 2021 takeover, exposing them to persecution for promoting UK values. While most were relocated to the UK by 2024 after years of hardship, some remain in danger, underscoring a critical failure in duty of care and the urgent need for systemic reform.

=== Expenses ===
In 2010, Conservative MP Mark Lancaster, the then Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, the then Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin, and other MPs were involved in rows over expenses incurred on undisclosed taxpayer-funded British Council trips. The British Council&#x27;s then chief executive, Martin Davidson, also faced press criticism for expenses claimed in an apparent breach of the British Council&#x27;s internal rules for overnight stays in London.

=== Closure in Russia ===
In 2007, the Russian government accused the British Council of an illegal operation by breaking Russian tax laws and ordered the organisation to close two of its offices. Many believed that the council had become the victim of a diplomatic row between the UK and Russia. In 2018, Russia expelled 23 British diplomats and closed down the British Council (due to a lack of regulations on its activities) along with the general consulate in St. Petersburg. The move was reported to be retaliation against the UK&#x27;s actions toward Russia for the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.

=== Israel and Palestine ===
The British Council has been a primary partner of the Palestine Festival of Literature since the Festival&#x27;s beginning in 2008. In 2009, the Israeli police, acting on a court order, closed down the venue scheduled to host the Festival&#x27;s closing event since there was Palestinian Authority involvement, but the British Council stepped in and the evening was relocated to its grounds.

The British Council supports the festival, also known as PalFest. A controversial issue arose in 2012 because PalFest&#x27;s website states that they endorse the &quot;2004 Palestinian call for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel&quot;. Susanna Nicklin, the council&#x27;s director of literature, said in response: &quot;The British Council is a non-political organisation, and we believe that international cultural exchange makes a powerful contribution to a more peaceful, tolerant and prosperous world. Therefore, the British Council does not support cultural or academic boycotts.&quot;

=== Closure in Syria ===

The British Council closed its operations in Syria in 2012 due to the ongoing conflict in the country. The closure was a result of the deteriorating security situation and the inability to ensure the safety of its staff and visitors.

=== Dissident Chinese writers ===
In April 2012, the British Council faced a storm of protests over the exclusion of dissident Chinese writers from the London Book Fair 2012. Critics included English PEN and journalist Nick Cohen writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, as well as Alastair Niven, a former Literature Director of the British Council itself.

===Cuts===
In March 2007, the British Council announced its &quot;intention to increase its investment in the Middle East, North Africa and Central and Southern Asia&quot;. In June 2007, MPs were told of further closures in Tel Aviv and East Jerusalem (where there had been a British Council Library since 1946). The British Council libraries in Athens and Belgrade were also scheduled to close. Similarly in India, the British Council Libraries at Bhopal and Thiruvananthapuram were closed despite protests from library users as part of the Council&#x27;s policy to &quot;reduce its physical presence&quot; in the country and to divert funds to mega projects in the fields of culture, education, science and research.

British Council libraries and offices have also been closed in several other countries judged by the British Council to be of little strategic or commercial importance, as it refocused its activities on China and the Persian Gulf area. Council offices were closed in Lesotho, Eswatini, Ecuador and provincial Länder in Germany in 2000–2001 – as well as Belarus – prompting Parliamentary criticism. Subsequent promises by British Council Chair Neil Kinnock to a conference in Edinburgh that the Belarus closure would hopefully prove to be just a &quot;temporary&quot; withdrawal proved illusory. The British Council office in Peru also closed in September 2006 as part of a rethink of its strategy in Latin America. In Italy, British Council closed its offices in Turin and Bologna and reduced the size of offices in Milan and Rome (with the closure of the library in the latter).

Charles Arnold-Baker, author of &quot;the Companion to British History&quot; said of the British Council&#x27;s shift in priorities: &quot;This whole policy is misconstrued from top to bottom. We are going somewhere where we can&#x27;t succeed and neglecting our friends in Europe who wish us well. The only people who are going to read our books in Beirut or Baghdad are converts already.&quot;

The article also points out that the Alliance française and the , unlike the British Council, are both expanding and replenishing libraries Europe-wide. France opened its new library in Tel Aviv in 2007, just a few months after the British Council closed there and shut down the British Council library in West Jerusalem. In Gaza, the Institut français supports the Gaza municipal library in partnership with the local authority and a municipal twinning link between Gaza City and the French port of Dunkirk. In Oslo, British Council informs Norwegian callers that &quot;our office is not open to the public and we do not have an enquiry service&quot;. Goethe Institute also has a more visible presence in Glasgow than the British Council. There is now, in contrast, only one British Council office left in Germany – and that is in Berlin.

===Accountability===
Formally it is to its sponsoring department, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, that the UK Parliamentary Table Office refers any parliamentary questions about the British Council.

The effectiveness of British Council efforts to promote higher education in China was examined in the UK by the House of Commons Select Committee on Education and Skills in a report issued in August 2007. It expressed concern that in terms of joint educational programmes involving Chinese universities, the UK lagged Australia, the US, Hong Kong, Canada and France. In its evidence to this committee, the British Council argued that &quot;UK degrees are highly valued by international students for their global recognition. International students adopt an essentially utilitarian view of higher education which is likely to increasingly involve consideration of value for money, including opting for programmes at least partly delivered offshore&quot;. As their preferred marketing &quot;model&quot;, the British Council gave the example of India where their UK India Education and Research Initiative is being &quot;championed&quot; by British multinational oil companies such as BP and Shell, the pharmaceutical giant GSK and arms company BAE Systems.

Criticism of British Council marketing efforts in this area has also come from Scotland where &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot; obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act showing that the British Council&#x27;s Marketing Co-ordinator in the US had been referring to the University of Stirling as &quot;The University of Sterling&quot; (sic) and also documenting &quot;tensions&quot; between Scottish Executive civil servants and British Council in India and China over overseas promotion of universities in Scotland where education is a devolved responsibility. &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot; reported that these turf wars were undermining the Scottish Executive&#x27;s key Fresh Talent policy.

Some of the activities of the British Council were examined in 2007/2008 by the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO&#x27;s report, &quot;The British Council: Achieving Impact&quot;, concluded: &quot;that the British Council&#x27;s performance is strong and valued by its customers and stakeholders&quot;. It also concluded, however, that its English classes are elitist and have unfair advantages over commercial providers, as well as questioning thousands of unanswered phone calls and e-mails to British Council offices.

As part of its examination of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Annual Report, the Foreign Affairs Committee spends an hour each year examining witnesses from the British Council but even this level of scrutiny is undermined by a Commons ruling exempting MPs from the requirement to declare overseas trips paid for by The British Council.

Two members of the Public Accounts Committee (Nigel Griffiths MP and Ian Davidson MP) were office-bearers in the British Council Associate Parliamentary Group. Nigel Griffiths MP was Vice-Chair of this British Council lobby group until stepping down as an MP.

In 2008, the British Council was called before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) following the earlier publication of a National Audit Office report. The subsequent PAC report confirmed that Nigel Griffiths MP – Vice Chair of The British Council Associate Parliamentary Group – was part of the small number of PAC members who approved this report on the British Council despite not having been recorded as being present during the evidence session – in June 2008 – where the British Council&#x27;s chief executive was cross-examined. Mr Griffiths had earlier travelled to Russia and spoke favourably of British Council activities there in January 1998 around the time that their man in St Petersburg (Stephen Kinnock) was expelled.

In April 2008, the British Council was told to ensure all portable media was encrypted after losing staff data and wrongly saying the disc was encrypted.

Following the accusations made against the British Council in Russia (see above) Trevor Royle, the diplomatic editor of &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot; quoted a &quot;British diplomatic source&quot; saying: &quot;There is a widespread assumption that The British Council is a wing of our Secret Intelligence Services, however minor. Officially it is no such thing but there are connections. Why should it be otherwise because all information is invaluable? After all, the British Council also deals with trade missions and inevitably that involves low-grade intelligence-gathering.&quot;

In 2005, along with the Alliance française, the Dante Alighieri Society, the , the Instituto Cervantes, and the Instituto Camões, the British Council shared in the Princess of Asturias Award for the outstanding achievements of Western Europe&#x27;s national cultural agencies in communications and the humanities. At the time of this joint award, the full extent of The British Council&#x27;s closure policies in Europe was not yet public knowledge.

=== In literature ===

Royle also goes on to note that the novel &quot;The Russia House&quot; by John Le Carré (former consular official David Cornwell) opens with a reference to The British Council. The organisation&#x27;s &quot;first-ever audio fair for the teaching of the English language and the spread of British culture&quot; is &quot;grinding to its excruciating end&quot; and one of its officials is packing away his stuff when he is approached by an attractive Russian woman to undertake clandestine delivery of a manuscript which she claims is a novel to an English publisher who she says is &quot;her friend&quot;!

It is also featured in one of the scenes in Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Third Man&quot; – the character Crabbin, played by Wilfrid Hyde-White in the film, worked for The British Council. In 1946, the writer George Orwell advised serious authors not to work for it as a day job arguing that &quot;the effort [of writing] is too much to make if one has already squandered one&#x27;s energies on semi-creative work such as teaching, broadcasting or composing propaganda for bodies such as the British Council&quot;. In her autobiography, Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman head of MI5, mentions working for British Council in India before joining the British Intelligence Services.

The British Council was referred to (and its man on-station, &quot;Goole&quot;) – frequently in a humorous way by Lawrence Durrell in his collection of anecdotes about a diplomat&#x27;s life on foreign postings for the Foreign Office – &quot;Antrobus Complete&quot;.

In the six Olivia Manning novels that make up The Balkan Trilogy and The Levant Trilogy, Guy Pringle is an employee of the British Council, and Council politics make up several of the plot points. The books portray Eastern Europe and the Middle East in the opening years of World War Two.

=== Burma ===

The role of the British Council in Myanmar in 1947 came under scrutiny with the release of classified documents to a BBC investigation by journalist Feargal Keane into the role of dissident British colonial officials in the assassination of the then Burmese independence leader Aung San (father of Aung San Suu Kyi). The BBC programme quoted from a 1948 document sent by the Chief of Police in Rangoon to the British Ambassador stating their belief that there had been British involvement in the assassination of Aung San and his Cabinet for which one of his political opponents was hanged and that &quot;the go-between&quot; had been a British Council official named in the programme.

=== Libya ===

In August 2011, a journalist from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; discovered a certificate dated 2007 issued by the British Council in Tripoli to a daughter of President Gaddafi who had previously been said to have been killed in a US raid on Gaddafi&#x27;s residence in 1986.

=== English and examinations ===

In July 2011, the Hong Kong edition of &quot;China Daily&quot; reported on the flourishing &quot;ghost-writing&quot; industry that critics suggest has sprung up around the British Council IELTS tests in China.

A major IELTS corruption scandal in Western Australia resulted in prosecutions in November 2011.

=== &quot;Connecting Classrooms&quot; ===

In January 2012, the press in Pakistan reported that the Federal Investigations Agency was investigating a visa scam associated with the British Council&#x27;s &quot;Connecting Classrooms&quot; programme.

==Chairs==

==Publications==

From 1967 to 1989, the British Council published the journal &quot;Media in Education and Development&quot;.

=== History ===
Initially titled &quot;CETO news&quot;, ISSN 0574-9409, it became &quot;Educational Television International: a journal of the Centre for Educational Television Overseas&quot;, ISSN 0424-6128, in March 1967 (volume 1, issue 1). The journal changed its name again, in March 1971, to &quot;Educational Broadcasting International: a journal of the Centre for Educational Development Overseas&quot;, ISSN 0013-1970 (volume 5, issue 1). Its final name change was to &quot;Media in Education and Development&quot;, ISSN 0262-0251, in December 1981 (volume 14 issue 4). The final issue went to print in 1989 (volume 22).

<text>The Food Standards Agency is a non-ministerial government department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for protecting public health in relation to food in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is led by a board appointed to act in the public interest. Its headquarters are in London, with offices in York, Birmingham, Wales and Northern Ireland. Its counterpart in Scotland is Food Standards Scotland.

==History==
The Agency was created in 2001 based on a report by Professor James, issued after several high-profile outbreaks and deaths from foodborne illness. It was felt that it was inappropriate to have one government department, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, responsible for both the health of the farming and food processing industries, and for food safety.

Uniquely for a UK Government department, the Food Standards Act gave the Agency the statutory right to publish the advice it gives to Ministers, and as a signal of its independence it declared that it would invariably do so. From its inception, the Agency declared that it would take no decisions about food policy except in open board meetings accessible to the public. Since 2003, these meetings have been webcast live, enabling consumers to see the decision-making process in action. Each meeting concludes with a question and answer session in which web viewers can question the board or its executive directly.

In 2006, the Wine Standards Board merged with the FSA, bringing with it responsibility for enforcing the EU wine regime in the UK.

Formerly an executive agency of the FSA, the Meat Hygiene Service merged with the FSA in April 2010 to form a new operations group with responsibility for the delivery of official controls.
Certain aspects of food labelling regulations in England were transferred from the Food Standards Agency to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on 1 September 2010. In England, the Agency retains responsibility for food safety-related labelling issues, whereas the devolved Food Standards Agency offices in Wales and Northern Ireland are still responsible for all labelling and standards policy.

Nutrition policy, including nutrition labelling, in England and Wales was transferred from the Food Standards Agency to the Department of Health and Social Care in England and to the Welsh Government&#x27;s Department of Health and Social Services on 1 October 2010. On the establishment of Public Health England in 2013, the nutrition policy team – led by Alison Tedstone – transferred there.

The Food Standards Agency offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland retained their responsibilities for nutrition policy. Plans to create a new food standards body in Scotland were announced by Ministers in June 2012, and in January 2015, this body was established through primary legislation. Food Standards Scotland took over from the FSA on 1 April 2015 as the public body responsible for food safety, food standards, nutrition, food labelling and meat inspection in Scotland.

==Events==
===Recalls and contamination===
In February 2005, the agency announced the discovery of the dye Sudan I in Worcester sauce, prompting a mass product recall of over 400 products that used the sauce as a flavouring.

On 31 March 2006, it published its &quot;Survey of benzene levels in soft drinks&quot;, which tested 150 products and found that four contained benzene levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water. The Agency asked for these to be removed from sale.

The Food Standards Agency also imposed restrictions on the sheep trade because of the consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe which were repealed in March 2012.

===Children&#x27;s advertising===
The FSA pushed for stricter rules on TV advertising to children of foods high in salt, sugar and fat and devised a nutritional profiling system to measure the balance of benefit and detriment in individual food products. In 2007, the UK TV regulator Ofcom introduced restrictions on advertising of products that scored poorly under the scheme.

===Food poisoning===
In June 2002, and re-released in June 2006, the FSA conducted an advertising campaign on British television, highlighting the danger of food poisoning caused by barbecues. The advert, intended to shock viewers, shows sausages sizzling on a barbecue, looking to the viewer as if they are cooked. However, when a pair of tongs pick up one of these sausages, it falls apart, and reveals pink, uncooked meat in the middle. To emphasize the risk of diarrhoea and vomiting caused by food poisoning, the song &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; by The Three Degrees is played in the background.

===Dean Review===
In 2005, Brenda Dean carried out an independent review of the Food Standards Agency. The report made 22 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Food Standards Agency board.

Dean concluded:

My overwhelming impression, having undertaken this Review, is of an organisation that has been extremely conscious of the importance of fulfilling the very serious responsibilities of changing both the perception and the reality of food safety in the UK.

It has done well in taking forward the experiences, good and bad, of the previous regime, to begin building its own reputation.

Most stakeholders agreed that the Agency has made significant progress towards improving food safety, gaining public confidence in food safety, and creating a modern culture in which it is the norm for procedures, information, consultation and decision-making to be in the public domain and to involve external stakeholders.

There was overwhelming support for the Agency&#x27;s policy of basing decisions on scientific evidence, and for this policy to be maintained and developed further. The vast majority of stakeholders believe the Agency to be independent and to act independently, with general recognition that decisions are based on scientific evidence.

There was general support for the Agency amongst all stakeholder groups, both in terms of the objectives of the Agency, and the way in which the Agency has approached and undertaken its responsibilities.

One principal criticism, identified in the report, was (Recommendation 20):

It is clear that many stakeholders believe the Agency has already made policy decisions on GM foods and organic foods and is not open to further debate. The Agency must address the perceptions of these stakeholders who have now formed views of the Agency founded on their belief that the basis upon which the Agency&#x27;s policy decisions were made was flawed.

===Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS)===
A food hygiene rating scheme has been deployed by the Food Standards Agency for all food businesses. Ratings are available at the business premises and online. 
Following a meeting in Cardiff, the FSA plans to make audit reports as widely available as possible for the public, following the example of Norwich City Council. According to Terence Collins, FSA&#x27;s Director of communication, the reason behind this decision is to make ratings simple and easily understood for every single business.

Apart from Scotland which is under a very simple Food Hygiene Information Scheme, the FSA&#x27;s Food Hygiene Rating Scheme will be tested throughout United Kingdom. As a result, ratings will range from 0 (improvement urgently needed) to 5 (very good), and may be displayed on a certificate. This information will also be made available online. Rating primary meat processing plants is the next step forward for the FSA, as meat audit are currently only available through Freedom of Information requests.

The local authority in Rutland is believed to the only one which has not accepted the scheme.

== Chairperson and advisory committees ==
Sir John Krebs was the first Chair of the Food Standards Agency, until 2005. Dame Deirdre Hutton was Chair between 2005 and July 2009, followed by
Jeff Rooker until July 2013. Tim Bennett, the former Deputy Chair, was appointed as interim Chair whilst a permanent appointment was made. Heather Hancock was appointed the new Chair on 1 April 2016, for a three-year term, and reappointed for a further three year term from 1 April 2019.

The Agency is advised by a number of independent expert committees, including the following: 

* Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs
* Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food
* Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes 
* Advisory Committee on Social Sciences
* Committee on Toxicity
* Science Council

<doc id="429852" wikidata="Q580133" url="?curid=429852" title="Baltic Shield">
<text>The Baltic Shield (or Fennoscandian Shield) is a segment of the Earth&#x27;s crust belonging to the East European Craton, representing a large part of Fennoscandia, northwestern Russia and the northern Baltic Sea. It is composed mostly of Archean and Proterozoic gneisses and greenstone which have undergone numerous deformations through tectonic activity. It contains the oldest rocks of the European continent with a thickness of 250–300 km.

The Baltic Shield is divided into five &quot;provinces&quot;: the Svecofennian and Sveconorwegian (or Southwestern gneiss) provinces in Fennoscandia, and the Karelian, Belomorian and Kola provinces in Russia. The latter three are divided further into several &quot;blocks&quot; and &quot;complexes&quot; and contain the oldest of the rocks, at 3100–2500 Ma (million years) old. The youngest rocks belong to the Sveconorwegian province, at 1700–900 Ma old.

Thought to be formerly part of an ancient continent, the Baltic Shield grew in size through collisions with neighbouring crustal fragments. The mountains created by these tectonic processes have since been eroded to their bases, the region being largely flat today. Through five successive Pleistocene glaciations and subsequent retreats, the Baltic Shield has been scoured clean of its overlying sediments, leaving expansive areas (most within Scandinavia) exposed. It is therefore of importance to geophysicists studying the geologic history and dynamics of eastern Europe.

The scouring and compression of the Baltic Shield by glacial movements created the area&#x27;s many lakes and streams, the land retaining only a thin layer of sandy sediment collected in depressions and eskers. Most soil consists of moraine, a grayish yellow mixture of sand and rocks, with a thin layer of humus on top. Vast forests, featuring almost exclusively the three species pine, spruce and birch, dominate the landscape, clearly demarcating its boundaries. The soil is acidic and has next to no carbonates such as limestone. The scouring by the ancient glaciers and the acidity of the soil have destroyed all palaeontologically interesting materials, such as fossils.

The Baltic Shield yields important industrial minerals and ores, such as those of iron, nickel, copper and platinum group metals. Because of its similarity to the Canadian Shield and cratons of southern Africa and Western Australia, the Baltic Shield had long been a suspected source of diamonds and gold. Currently, the Central Lapland Greenstone Belt in the north is considered to be an unexplored area that has the potential to hold exploitable gold deposits.

Recent exploration has revealed a significant number of diamond-bearing kimberlites in the Kola Peninsula, and (possibly extensive) deposits of gold in Finland.

== Denudation chronology ==

Mountains that existed in Precambrian time were eroded into a subdued terrain already during the late Mesoproterozoic, when the rapakivi granites intruded. Further erosion made the terrain rather flat at the time of the deposition of Jotnian sediments. With Proterozoic erosion amounting to tens of kilometers, many of the Precambrian rocks seen today in Finland are the &quot;roots&quot; of ancient massifs. The last major leveling event resulted in the formation of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain in late Neoproterozoic time.

Laurentia and Baltica collided in the Silurian and Devonian, producing a Himalayas-sized mountain range named the Caledonian Mountains roughly over the same area as the present-day Scandinavian Mountains. During the Caledonian orogeny, Finland was likely a sunken foreland basin covered by sediments; subsequent uplift and erosion would have eroded all of these sediments. While Finland has remained buried or very close to sea-level since the formation of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain, some further relief was formed by a slight uplift, resulting in the carving of valleys by rivers. The slight uplift also means that in places the uplifted peneplain can be traced as summit accordances.
Denudation in the Mesozoic is counted at most in hundreds of meters. The inselberg plain of Finnish Lapland is estimated to have formed in Late Cretaceous or Paleogene times, either by pediplanation or etchplanation. Any older Mesozoic surface in Finnish Lapland is unlikely to have survived erosion. Further west, the Muddus plains and its inselbergs formed—also by etching and pediplanation—in connection to the uplift of the northern Scandinavian Mountains in the Paleogene.

The northern Scandinavian Mountains had their main uplift in the Paleogene, while the southern Scandinavian Mountains and the South Swedish Dome were largely uplifted in the Neogene. The uplift events were concurrent with the uplift of Eastern Greenland. All of these uplifts are thought to be related to far-field stresses in Earth&#x27;s lithosphere. According to this view, the Scandinavian Mountains and the South Swedish Dome can be likened to a giant anticlinal lithospheric folds. Folding could have been caused by horizontal compression acting on a thin to thick crustal transition zone (as are all passive margins). The uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains resulted in the progressive tilt of northern Sweden, contributing to create the parallel drainage pattern of that region. As the South Swedish Dome uplifted, this resulted in the formation of a piedmonttreppen and the obstruction of the Eridanos River, diverting it to the south.

While being repeatedly covered by glaciers during the Quaternary (last 2.58 million years), Fennoscandia has seen little effect on any changes in its topography from glacial erosion. Denudation during this time is geographically highly variable but averages tens of meters. The southern coast of Finland, Åland and the Stockholm archipelago were subject to considerable glacial erosion in the form of scraping during the Quaternary. The Quaternary ice ages resulted in the glacier&#x27;s erosion of irregularly distributed weak rock, weathered rock mantles, and loose materials. When the ice masses retreated, eroded depressions turned into the many lakes seen now in Finland and Sweden. Fractures in the bedrock were particularly affected by weathering and erosion, leaving as result straight sea and lake inlets.

<doc id="429854" wikidata="Q4794641" url="?curid=429854" title="Arne Næss Jr.">
<text>Arne Næss Jr. (; born Arne Rudolf Ludvig Raab; 8 December 1937 – 13 January 2004) was a Norwegian businessman and the second husband of Diana Ross.

== Early life ==
Næss was born in Germany, to German physician August Oskar German Raab (1901–1993) and Kirsten &quot;Kiki&quot; Dekke Næss (1907–2001), a Norwegian national whose uncle was philosopher and mountaineer Arne Næss. Næss&#x27; family lived in Germany during World War II. His parents divorced after the war, and Næss moved to Norway with his mother where they both took her maiden name Næss.

== Career ==
In 1964, Næss moved to New York to work for his uncle Erling Dekke Næss, a shipping magnate and businessman. He started his own business in London in 1968 where he was successful in shipping and oil, and in real estate. He would go on to make a few bad investments in the 1990s in Pyramid scheme Global Money Games. His biggest success was an investment in an IT business, Tandberg Data, and various global real estate investments. At the time of his death in 2004, Næss&#x27; shipping empire was reputedly worth some $600 million. He spent his final years in Switzerland.

=== Mountaineering ===
By age 19, Næss had already made twenty first ascents of Norwegian mountains. In the 1960s, he focused primarily on his career. In the 1970s, he returned to mountain climbing. In 1985, he led the first Norwegian expedition to Mount Everest. Also participating was British mountaineer Chris Bonington. When asked, during a late-1990s television interview, about the risks of mountaineering, Næss replied, &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t liked risks, I would rather have played tennis or golf.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1966, Næss married Filippa Kumlin d&#x27;Orey of Sweden and together they had a son, Christoffer, and two daughters, Katinka and folk pop crossover singer Leona Næss. After they divorced, he was in a relationship with Norwegian actress Mari Maurstad. In 1985, Næss met American singer Diana Ross on a trip to the Bahamas. He and Ross married in 1986 and had two sons, Ross Arne Næss (born October 7, 1987) and Evan Olav Næss (born August 26, 1988). Through his marriage, he gained three stepdaughters, Rhonda Ross Kendrick (Ross&#x27; daughter with Motown Records founder Berry Gordy), Chudney Ross, and Tracee Ellis Ross; the latter two being Ross&#x27; daughters from her first marriage to music executive Robert Ellis Silberstein. The couple divorced in 2000. Næss spent his remaining four years with Norwegian-born Camilla Astrup; they had two sons, Nicklas and Louis.

== Death ==
Næss was staying with his friend Johann Rupert on 13 January 2004 when he died in a climbing accident while descending from a peak on Rupert&#x27;s estate in the Groot Drakenstein mountains near the town of Franschhoek outside Cape Town, South Africa. According to police reports, Næss&#x27; anchoring equipment loosened from the porous mountainside, leading to a 103-metre fall. He was 66 years old.

In May 2004, Næss was posthumously awarded the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Grifo (c. 726–753) was the son of the Frankish major domo Charles Martel and his second wife Swanachild.

After the death of Charles Martel, power may well have been intended to be divided among Grifo and his half-brothers Pepin the Short and Carloman. Grifo, who was considered illegitimate by Pepin and Carloman, was besieged in Laon by his half-brothers, captured, and imprisoned in a monastery.

On his escape in 747, his maternal great-uncle Duke Odilo of Bavaria provided support and assistance to Grifo, but when Odilo died a year later and Grifo attempted to seize the duchy of Bavaria for himself, Pepin, who had become sole major domo of the Frankish (Merovingian) Empire upon Carloman&#x27;s resignation and retreat into a monastery, took decisive action by invading Bavaria and installing Odilo&#x27;s infant son, Tassilo III, as duke under Frankish overlordship. Grifo continued his rebellion, but was eventually killed in the battle of Saint-Jean de Maurienne in 753, while Pepin became king of the Franks as Pepin III in 751.

<text> is a Latin phrase meaning first among equals. It is typically used as an honorary title for someone who is formally equal to other members of their group but is accorded unofficial respect, traditionally owing to their seniority in office.

Historically, the &quot;princeps senatus&quot; of the Roman Senate was such a figure and initially bore only the distinction that he was allowed to speak first during debate. After the fall of the Republic, Roman emperors initially referred to themselves only as &quot;princeps&quot; despite having enormous power.

Various modern figures such as the prime minister in parliamentary systems, the president of the Swiss Confederation, the chief justice of the United States, the chief justice of the Philippines, the archbishop of Canterbury of the Anglican Communion, the chair of the Federal Reserve in the United States and the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople of the Eastern Orthodox Church fall under both senses: Bearing higher status and various additional powers while remaining still merely equal to their peers in important senses.

== National use ==

===China===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which was placed under the collective leadership of the Politburo Standing Committee following the death of Chairman Mao Zedong, the term &quot;first among equals&quot; was often used to describe China&#x27;s paramount leader at the zenith of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s influence. This has fallen out of favour since the consolidation of power under the current core leader, General Secretary Xi Jinping.

===Commonwealth usage===
====United Kingdom====
The term &quot;prime minister&quot; can be compared to &quot;primary minister&quot; or &quot;first minister&quot;. Because of this, the prime ministers of many countries are traditionally considered to be &quot;first among equals&quot; – they are the chairman or &quot;head&quot; of a Cabinet rather than holding an office that is &quot;de jure&quot; superior to that of ministers.

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has frequently been described as &quot;first among equals&quot;. In the UK, the executive is the Cabinet, and during Hanoverian times a minister had the role of informing the monarch about proposed legislation in the House of Commons and other matters. In modern times, however, although the phrase is still occasionally used, it understates the powers of the prime minister, which now include many broad, exclusive, executive powers over which cabinet members have little influence.

&quot;First Among Equals&quot; is the title of a popular political novel (1984) by Jeffrey Archer, about the careers and private lives of several men vying to become British Prime Minister. It was later adapted into a ten-part TV series, produced by Granada Television.

====Federal government in Commonwealth realms====
In the federal Commonwealth realms in which King Charles III is head of state as constitutional monarch, a governor-general is appointed by the King-in-Council to represent the King during his absence. The governor-general typically appoints the leader of the political party holding at least a plurality of seats in the elected legislature to be prime minister, whose relationship with the other ministers of the Crown is in theory said to be that of a , or &quot;first among equals&quot;.

====Australian states====
In Australia, governors represent the Australian monarch in each of the states of Australia that comprise the federal Commonwealth of Australia, making them &quot;head of state&quot; in each of their own states. These are not envisaged as subordinate to the governor-general of Australia, although however the federal viceroy is &quot;first among equals&quot;. The state governors appoint premiers, typically the leader of the political party holding at least a plurality of seats in the elected legislature.

====Canadian provinces====
As federations in Canada, lieutenant-governors represent the Canadian monarch in each of the provinces, thus, acting as the &quot;heads of state&quot; in the provinces. Lieutenant-governors in Canada are appointed by the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister of Canada, known as the &quot;Governor-in-Council&quot;. In each case, these lieutenant-governors are not envisaged as subordinate to the governor general who, as a federal viceroy, is &quot;first among equals&quot;. A lieutenant governor as &quot;Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council&quot; appoints a leader of a provincial political party holding at least a plurality of seats in the elected provincial legislature to be provincial premier.

===Germany===
Mayors of German city states have traditionally acted as . In Hamburg, Lübeck and Bremen, which had been Free Imperial Cities from the times of the Holy Roman Empire, the government was called Senate. The mayor was one senator amongst many, often referred to as president of the Senate rather than mayor. This ended in Lübeck with the incorporation into Prussia in 1937. While in a constitutional reform in 1996, the mayor of Hamburg was given broad powers to shape the politics of the Senate of Hamburg, thus, ending his status as . However, in the city state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen which was created after the Second World War, the mayor has had a similar role in the Senate of Bremen. The same was true until 1995 for the governing mayor of Berlin among his colleagues within the Senate of Berlin.

===Japan===
Starting with the Meiji Constitution of 1885, as part of the &quot;Cabinet System Act&quot;, and lasting until the revision of the modern constitution in 1947, the prime minister of Japan was legally considered to be of the same rank as the other ministers who formed the Cabinet. During this time, the prime minister was referred to as &quot;同輩中の首席&quot; &quot;dōhai-chū no shuseki&quot; (&quot;chief among peers&quot;).

===Netherlands===
The prime minister of the Netherlands (officially, the &quot;minister-president&quot;) is the chairman of the Council of Ministers and active executive authority of the Dutch government. Although formally no special powers are assigned, the prime minister functions as the &quot;face&quot; of the cabinet of the Netherlands. Usually, the prime minister is also minister of General Affairs. Until 1945, the position of chairman of the Council of Ministers officially switched between the ministers, although practices differed throughout history. In 1945, the position was formally instituted. Although not formally necessary, the prime minister in practice is the leader of the largest party in the majority coalition in the House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament.

===Singapore===
The phrase &quot;first among equals&quot; is often used to describe the political succession within the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party leadership and future candidate for the prime minister of Singapore.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the seven-member Federal Council constitutes the executive in the Swiss directorial system. Each year, the Federal Assembly elects a president of the Confederation. By convention, the positions of President and Vice President rotate annually, each Councillor thus becoming vice president and then President every seven years while in office.

The president is not the Swiss head of state, but is the highest-ranking Swiss official. The president presides over Council meetings and carries out certain representative functions that, in other countries, are the business of the head of state. In urgent situations where a Council decision cannot be made in time, the president is empowered to act on behalf of the whole Council. Apart from that, though, the president is a , having no power above and beyond the other six councillors.

===United States===

The phrase &quot;first among equals&quot; has also been used to describe the Chief Justice of the United States.

The Chief Justice has no authority over the decisions of the other Justices, but holds one key administrative power: when the Chief Justice votes with the majority on a decision, they can either author the majority opinion or assign it to another Justice voting with the majority.

== Chairmen ==
In many private parliamentary bodies, such as clubs, boards, educational faculty, and committees, the officer or member who holds the position of chair or chairman is often regarded as a &quot;first among equals&quot;. That is, while most rules of order will grant the chair special powers within the context of a meeting, the position of chair is usually temporary, rotating, and powerless in other contexts, making the occupant merely a temporary leader required to instil order. This is the case for mayors under a council–manager government, as the &quot;mayor&quot; has the same vote as all other council members and cannot override them, although their opinion may have more sway among other members.

== Religion ==

=== Catholic Church ===
In Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches, the Pope (Bishop of Rome) is seen as the Vicar of Christ and &quot;first among equals&quot;, the successor of Saint Peter, and leader of the Christian world, in accordance with the rules of Apostolic succession to the apostles. In the Catholic Church, the Pope holds the office with supreme authority in canon law over all other bishops.
In the Catholic Church, the Dean of the College of Cardinals is the first among equal Prince of the Church in the college, which is the pope&#x27;s highest-ranking council and elects the papal successor, generally from its own ranks.

Various episcopal sees were granted or claim the title of primate (usually of a past or present political entity), which grants such a &quot;primas&quot; (usually a metropolitan archbishopric, often in a former/present capital) precedence over all other sees in its circumscription, outranking (other) metropolitan sees, but the incumbent primates can be trumped by personal ranks, as they rank below cardinals. More commonly, dioceses are geographically grouped in an ecclesiastical province, where only one holds the rank of metropolitan archbishop, which outranks his colleagues, who are therefore called his suffragans, even if these include (fairly rarely) another archbishop.

=== Eastern Orthodox Churches ===

The phrase &quot;first among equals&quot; is also used to describe the role of the patriarch of Constantinople, who, as the &quot;ecumenical patriarch&quot;, is the first among all the bishops of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He has no direct jurisdiction over the other patriarchs or the other autocephalous Orthodox churches and cannot interfere in the election of bishops in autocephalous churches, but he alone enjoys the right of convening extraordinary synods consisting of them or their delegates to deal with ad hoc situations, and he has also convened well-attended pan-Orthodox Synods in the last forty years. His title is an acknowledgement of his historic significance and of his privilege to serve as primary spokesman for the Eastern Orthodox Communion. 

Eastern Christians considered the bishop of Rome to be the &quot;first among equals&quot; during the first thousand years of Christianity according to the ancient, first millennial order (or &quot;taxis&quot; in Greek) of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, known as the Pentarchy that was established after Constantinople became the eastern capital of the Byzantine Empire. 

The canons relative to the universal primacy of honor of the patriarch of Constantinople are the 9th canon of the synod of Antioch and the 28th canon of the Council of Chalcedon.

===Lutheran Churches===
In the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Archbishop of Uppsala is considered by the church as . As such, the Archbishop of Uppsala has no powers over the other 13 bishops but has some additional administrative and spiritual duties, as specified in the Church Order of the Church of Sweden. According to the chapter 8 of the Church Order, only the Archbishop of Uppsala can ordain a bishop. The other bishops of the Church of Sweden are peers, not subordinate, to the Archbishop of Uppsala. Among the Archbishop of Uppsala&#x27;s other duties is the obligation to convene and chair the Episcopal Assembly. Unlike the other bishops, who are elected to office by members of their diocese, the Archbishop of Uppsala is elected by the entire body of the church. There is a peculiar regulation that stipulates that the total votes cast in the archdiocese of Uppsala, when electing an archbishop, &quot;shall be divided by ten, with decimals removed&quot;, before being added to the national vote.

In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, the Archbishop of Turku and Finland serves as the &quot;primus inter pares&quot;.

The bishop of the Slovak Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Serbia is the primus inter pares of that denomination.

=== Anglican Communion ===
According to the Anglican Covenant, the archbishop of Canterbury is &quot;first among equals&quot; in his presidency over the Anglican Communion. The senior bishop of the seven diocesan bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church bears the truncated title primus from . Leading bishops or primates in other Anglican &#x27;national&#x27; churches are often said to be within their provinces (e.g. Church of Ireland), while the (first) primatial see of Canterbury remains primus among them.

However, on 20 February 2023, the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches declared the Archbishop of Canterbury had lost its mantle of first among equals due to him accepting the Church of England&#x27;s incorporation into the Anglican liturgy of blessings of same-sex unions.

The International Anglican-Catholic Commission for Unity and Mission, in its 2007 agreed statement &quot;Growing Together in Unity and Mission,&quot; &quot;urge[s] Anglicans and Catholics to explore together how the ministry of the Bishop of Rome might be offered and received in order to assist our Communions to grow towards full, ecclesial communion&quot;.

===Reformed and Presbyterianism===
The Moderator of the General Assembly in a Presbyterian church is similarly designated as a . This concept holds also for the Moderators of each Synod, Presbytery, and Kirk Session. As all elders are ordained – some for teaching and some for ruling – none sit in higher status, but all are considered equal behind the one and only head of the church Jesus Christ.

In churches and denominations with a three office view (i.e., there are three ecclesiastical offices; namely minister, elder, and deacon), the minister does not hold more ruling authority than the elders, but has additional duties of administering the sacraments and preaching. He is also expected to lead the session or consistory of elders.

<text>Wilhelm Stoph (9 July 1914 – 13 April 1999) was a German politician. He served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from 1964 to 1973, and again from 1976 until 1989. He also served as chairman of the State Council from 1973 to 1976.

==Biography==
Stoph was born in Berlin in 1914; his father died the following year in World War I. In 1928, Stoph joined the Young Communist League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands; KJVD) and in 1931 he joined the Communist Party of Germany. He was conscripted into the Wehrmacht from 1935 to 1937, and served during World War II from 1940 to 1945.

He was assigned to the 293rd Infantry Division&#x27;s artillery regiment, and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and rose to the rank of Unteroffizier. As the war ended, according to historian Harris Lentz, &quot;Stoph worked with the Communist-dominated Socialist Unity party and served on the party&#x27;s executive committee from 1947.&quot;


Following the establishment of the GDR in 1949, Stoph became a member of the Socialist Unity Party&#x27;s Central Committee and member of the Volkskammer in 1950. He was named to the Politbüro in 1953. He served as Interior Minister from 9 May 1952 to 1 July 1955, and as East Germany&#x27;s first Defense Minister from 18 January 1956 to 14 July 1960. As defense minister, he was awarded the rank of Armeegeneral.

After having served as first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers (first Deputy Prime Minister) from 1960 to 1964, he was named Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Ministerrat), or Prime Minister, in 1964 after the death of Otto Grotewohl. However, he had been serving as acting chairman of the council since October 1960 due to Grotewohl&#x27;s poor health. He was initially thought to be the heir apparent to longtime party leader Walter Ulbricht, but his ascendancy was checked by Erich Honecker. After Ulbricht&#x27;s death in 1973, Stoph became Chairman of the Council of State—a post equivalent in rank to president of the GDR. After Volkskammer elections in 1976, Honecker re-arranged the state and party leadership structure. Believing that Stoph&#x27;s successor as prime minister, Horst Sindermann, was too liberal on economic matters, Honecker replaced him with Stoph.

During his first stint as Prime Minister, Stoph began a series of negotiations with West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1970. It marked the first ever meeting between the leaders of East and West Germany.

Stoph was known as a man who could be trusted to carry out the directives of the SED&#x27;s Politburo; indeed, Honecker tapped him for his second stint in the premiership for this reason. For the most part, Stoph was a loyal supporter of Honecker. Although he nominally held the highest state post in the GDR, in practice he was outranked by Honecker, who derived most of his power from his post as general secretary of the SED.

However, Stoph joined the plot to remove Honecker in October 1989. At the Politburo meeting at which Honecker was voted out, Stoph made the motion to depose Honecker and replace him with Egon Krenz. A month later, on 13 November, Stoph and his entire 44-member cabinet resigned in response to public pressure. Stoph was subsequently arrested for corruption in December 1989. Despite his role in pushing Honecker out, the SED expelled Stoph on December 3, the same day it expelled Honecker. He was later spared detention on grounds of ill health. In 1994, a court in Berlin decided that his seized savings of 200,000 Deutsche Mark would not be returned to him.

Stoph died in Berlin at the age of 84 on 13 April 1999. He was buried in Wildau.

<text>Max Knoll(17 July 1897 – 6 November 1969) was a German electrical engineer and co-inventor of the electron microscope.
Knoll was born in Wiesbaden and studied at the University of Munich and at the Technischen Hochschulen in Munich and Berlin-Charlottenburg, where he obtained his doctorate in the Institute for High Voltage Technology. In 1927 he became the leader of the electron research group there, where he and his co-worker, Ernst Ruska, invented the electron microscope in 1931. In April 1932, Knoll joined Telefunken in Berlin to do developmental work in the field of television design. He was also a private lecturer in Berlin.

After World War II, Knoll joined the University of Munich as an extraordinary professor and director of the Institute for Electromedicine. He moved to the USA in 1948, to work at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

In 1956 he returned to Munich and engaged in a series of experiments at the Technische Hochschule, involving the generation of phosphenes by electrically stimulating the brains of himself and other subjects. He retired in 1966.

<text>Sir John Flasby Lawrance Whittingdale (born 16 October 1959) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Maldon (and its predecessors) since 1992 and Shadow Minister for Health and Social Care since July 2024. He previously served as Culture Secretary from 2015 to 2016. Whittingdale was most recently Minister of State for Media, Tourism and Creative Industries and Minister of State for Data and Digital Infrastructure from May to December 2023, during the maternity leave of Julia Lopez.

Whittingdale has been an MP since the 1992 general election, for a series of constituencies centred on the town of Maldon, Essex. He was Vice-Chairman of the 1922 Committee. He was a member of the Executive of Conservative Way Forward (2005–2010) and the Conservative Party Board (2006–2010).

Whittingdale served as Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee from 2005 to 2015. He was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport by Prime Minister David Cameron in May 2015. He was one of the six Cabinet ministers to come out in favour of Brexit during the 2016 EU referendum and was afterwards a supporter of the Eurosceptic campaign Leave Means Leave. He was dismissed in July 2016 by incoming-Prime Minister Theresa May.

==Early life and career==
John Whittingdale was born on 16 October 1959, in Sherborne, Dorset. He is the only son of John Whittingdale (1894–1974) and Margaret Esme Scott (1920–), &quot;née&quot; Napier. On his mother&#x27;s side, Whittingdale is in distant remainder to the lordship of Napier. 

Whittingdale was privately educated at both Sandroyd School and Winchester College, followed by University College London (UCL) where he was Chairman of UCL Conservative Society. He graduated with a 2:2 in Economics in 1982.

From 1982 to 1984, Whittingdale was head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department. He then served as Special Adviser to three successive Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, Norman Tebbit (1984–1985); Leon Brittan (1985–1986), and Paul Channon (1986–1987). He worked on international privatisation at NM Rothschild in 1987 and in January 1988, became Political Secretary to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Upon her resignation Whittingdale was appointed Order of the British Empire and continued to serve as her Political Secretary until being elected to Parliament in 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1992 general election, Whittingdale was elected as MP for South Colchester and Maldon with 54.8% of the vote and a majority of 21,821. After the election, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Eric Forth, Minister of State for Education and Employment, but resigned after voting against the Government for an amendment that would have allowed media publishers with more than a 20% share of the national press market to buy an ITV company.

Prior to the 1997 general election, Whittingdale&#x27;s constituency of South Colchester and Maldon was abolished and replaced with Maldon and East Chelmsford. Whittingdale was elected at the 1997 general election as MP for Maldon and East Chelmsford with 48.7% of the vote and a majority of 10,039. In 1999, Whittingdale became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, succeeding David Lidington.

At the 2001 general election, Whittingdale was re-elected as MP for Maldon and East Chelmsford with an increased vote share of 49.2% and a decreased majority of 8,462. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with an increased vote share of 51.5% and an increased majority of 12,573. 

Prior to the 2010 general election, Whittingdale&#x27;s constituency of Maldon and East Chelmsford was abolished and replaced with Maldon. At the general election, Whittingdale was elected as MP for Maldon with 59.8% of the vote and a majority of 19,407.

In April 2011 Whittingdale called for a public inquiry into phone hacking at the &quot;News of the World&quot; and to why a series of investigations by Scotland Yard failed to link any News International employees to phone hacking other than the &quot;News of the World&quot;&#x27;s former royal editor, Clive Goodman. Whittingdale said: &quot;There are some very big questions; what I find [most] worrying is the apparent unwillingness of the police, who had the evidence and chose to do nothing with it. That&#x27;s something that needs to be looked into.&quot; 

In 2012, Whittingdale was Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Privacy and Injunctions. From 2012 to 2019 he was Vice Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group.

Whittingdale was among the 175 MPs who voted against the Same-sex Marriage Bill in 2013. 

In 2014, Whittingdale along with six other Conservative MPs voted against the Equal Pay (Transparency) Bill which would require all companies with more than 250 employees to declare the gap in pay between the average male and average female salaries.

At the 2015 general election, Whittingdale was re-elected as MP for Maldon with an increased vote share of 60.6% and an increased majority of 22,070.

Whittingdale was in favour of Brexit during the 2016 EU membership referendum. Following the referendum, he was one of several Conservative MPs who signed a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May urging that the UK withdraw from both the European single market and the Customs Union. After the referendum, Whittingdale was a supporter of the Eurosceptic campaign Leave Means Leave.

At the snap 2017 general election, Whittingdale was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 67.9% and an increased majority of 23,430. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election with an increased vote share of 72% and an increased majority of 30,041. Whittingdale was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 38.9% and a decreased majority of 6,906.

===Media Select Committee===
On 14 July 2005 Whittingdale became the chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. In this role he led the committee&#x27;s investigation in 2009 and 2010 into libel and privacy issues, including the News International phone hacking scandal after &quot;The Guardian&quot; first revealed the extent of the practice at the &quot;News of the World&quot;. He was alleged to have warned members of the committee to consider not compelling former &quot;News of the World&quot; editor Rebekah Brooks to testify due to the potential risk that their personal lives would be investigated in revenge, but has strongly denied the accusation.

With just one out of three of News International&#x27;s senior executives agreeing to appear before the committee session on 19 July, Whittingdale took the rarely used step of issuing a summons to compel the Murdochs to attend. Whittingdale said Select Committees had taken such steps against individuals in the past and they had complied and continued &quot;I hope very much that the Murdochs will respond similarly.&quot; They both did, on 19 July, in what one paper described as the most important Select Committee hearing in parliamentary history.

For its successful work on the phone hacking scandal, Whittingdale accepted &quot;The Spectator&quot;″s 2011 &quot;Inquisitor of the Year&quot; award on behalf of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.

===Culture Secretary===
Whittingdale was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport by Prime Minister David Cameron on 11 May 2015. He was sworn in to the Privy Council following his appointment.

In April 2016, Shadow Culture Secretary Maria Eagle called for Whittingdale to recuse himself from decisions regarding the outcome of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics because the story about Whittingdale&#x27;s former girlfriend being a sex worker exposed him to pressure from the press. A week later, it emerged that Whittingdale had accepted hospitality from the Lap Dancing Association in about 2008 at which time Whittingdale and two other MPs visited two clubs in one evening, while the industry&#x27;s licensing was under investigation by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. The hospitality was not declared in the Register of members&#x27; interests, or later when Whittingdale later spoke out in the Commons against new regulations introduced by the Labour Government.

On 14 July 2016, Whittingdale was dismissed from his position as Culture Secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May.

In July 2016, shortly after his dismissal, &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticised Whittingdale over his decision to turn down a request from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for the release of historic documents relating to Mark Thatcher&#x27;s dealings with the government of Oman in the 1980s. Roy Greenslade wrote that few, &quot;apart from the man himself and his friends&quot;, could disagree with the argument that the public had a right to know.

Whittingdale returned to the DCMS in February 2020, but as a minister of state rather than secretary of state. He was the minister of state for media and data. Having left the department in 2021, Whittingdale once again returned to DCMS in May 2023, being appointed Acting Minister of State for Media, Tourism and Creative Industries, as well as Minister of State at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, effective when Julia Lopez took maternity leave.

==Personal life==
Whittingdale married Ancilla Campbell Murfitt, a nurse and school governor, in 1990; the couple had two children before their divorce. Whittingdale&#x27;s half-brother is Charles Napier, former treasurer of the defunct Paedophile Information Exchange, who was most recently convicted of child sexual abuse offences in November 2014.

On 12 April 2016, British media reported Whittingdale had been involved in a relationship with a female sex worker between August 2013 and February 2014. In a statement to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme, he said he had been unaware of his girlfriend&#x27;s true occupation after meeting her through Match.com, and that he had ended the relationship after he had discovered it through reports that the story was being offered for publication to tabloids. On 13 April 2016, David Cameron&#x27;s spokesman said, &quot;John Whittingdale&#x27;s view was that this was in the past, and had been dealt with.&quot;

Whittingdale is a member of the Church of England.

== Honours ==
** 21 December 1990: Appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1990 Resignation Honours.
** 14 May 2015: Appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, giving him the honorific prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
** 14 October 2022: Appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2022 Special Honours.
** 2019: Third Class of the Order of Merit of Ukraine

<text>A gastrolith, also called a stomach stone or gizzard stone, is a rock held inside a gastrointestinal tract. Gastroliths in some species are retained in the muscular gizzard and used to grind food in animals lacking suitable grinding teeth. In other species the rocks are ingested and pass through the digestive system and are frequently replaced. The grain size depends upon the size of the animal and the gastrolith&#x27;s role in digestion. Other species use gastroliths as ballast. Particles ranging in size from sand to cobble have been documented.

==Etymology==
Gastrolith comes from the Greek γαστήρ (&quot;gastēr&quot;), meaning &quot;stomach&quot;, and λίθος (&quot;lithos&quot;), meaning &quot;stone&quot;.

==Occurrence==

Among living vertebrates, gastroliths are common among crocodiles, alligators, herbivorous birds, seals and sea lions. Domestic fowl require access to &quot;grit&quot;. Stones swallowed by ostriches can exceed a length of . Apparent microgastroliths have also been found in frog tadpoles. Ingestion of silt and gravel by tadpoles of various anuran (frog) species has been observed to improve buoyancy control.

Some extinct animals such as sauropod dinosaurs appear to have used stones to grind tough plant matter. A rare example of this is the Early Cretaceous theropod &quot;Caudipteryx zoui&quot; from northeastern China, which was discovered with a series of small stones, interpreted as gastroliths, in the area of its skeleton that would have corresponded with its abdominal region. Aquatic animals, such as plesiosaurs, may have used them as ballast, to help balance themselves or to decrease their buoyancy, as crocodiles do. Research indicates that the presence of gastroliths in elasmosaurid plesiosaurs differs from that of the short-necked plesiosaurs. While some fossil gastroliths are rounded and polished, many stones in living birds are not polished at all. Gastroliths associated with dinosaur fossils can weigh several kilograms.

Certain crayfish store gastroliths in their stomachs. Crayfish living in freshwater store these gastroliths as the presence of calcium is limited in freshwater. These gastroliths serve as a calcium source for molting.

==Paleontology==

===History of discovery===
In 1906, George Reber Weiland reported the presence of worn and polished quartz pebbles associated with the remains of plesiosaurs and sauropod dinosaurs and interpreted these stones as gastroliths. In 1907, Barnum Brown found gravel in close association with the fossil remains of the duck-billed hadrosaur &quot;Claosaurus&quot; and interpreted it as gastroliths. Brown was among the first paleontologists to recognize that dinosaurs used gastroliths in their digestive systems to aid in the grinding of food. Other paleontologists over the years were unconvinced. In 1932, Friedrich von Huene found stones in Late Triassic sediments, in association with the fossil remains of the prosauropod &quot;Sellosaurus&quot; and interpreted them as gastroliths. In 1934, the Howe Quarry, a fossil location in northwestern Wyoming also yielded dinosaur bones with their associated gastroliths. In 1942, William Lee Stokes recognized the presence of gastroliths in the remains of sauropod dinosaurs recovered from Late Jurassic strata.

===Identification===
Geologists usually require several pieces of evidence before they will accept that a rock was used by a dinosaur to aid its digestion. First, it should be rounded on all edges (and some are polished) because inside a dinosaur&#x27;s gizzard any genuine gastrolith would have been acted upon by other stones and fibrous materials in a process similar to the action of a rock tumbler. Second, the stone must be unlike the rock found in its geological vicinity, i.e., its geologic context. Many gastroliths have been found in fine grained lake, mud, and swamp deposits. These environs are calm water deposits and could not carry pebbles and cobbles (unlike a river or beach). Oliver Wings also argues that the stone must be found with the fossils of the dinosaur which ingested it. It is this last criterion that causes trouble in identification, as smooth stones found without context can (possibly erroneously in some cases) be dismissed as having been polished by water or wind. Christopher H. Whittle (1988,9) pioneered scanning electron microscope analysis of wear patterns on gastroliths. Wings (2003) found that ostrich gastroliths would be deposited outside the skeleton if the carcass was deposited in an aquatic environment for as little as a few days following death. He concludes that this is likely to hold true for all birds (with the possible exception of moa) due to their air-filled bones which would cause a carcass deposited in water to float for the time it needs to rot sufficiently to allow gastroliths to escape.

Gastroliths can be distinguished from stream- or beach-rounded rocks by several criteria: gastroliths are highly polished on the higher surfaces, with little or no polish in depressions or crevices, often strongly resembling the surface of worn animal teeth. Stream- or beach-worn rocks, particularly in a high-impact environment, show less polishing on higher surfaces, often with many small pits or cracks on these higher surfaces. Finally, highly polished gastroliths often show long microscopic rilles, defined by Whittle as &quot;longitudinal gashes, deeper than one millimeter and longer than one centimeter at a magnification of 50 times&quot;. These are presumably caused by contact with stomach acid. Since most gastroliths were scattered when the animal died and many entered a stream or beach environment, some gastroliths show a mixture of these wear features. Others were undoubtedly swallowed by other dinosaurs and highly polished gastroliths may have been swallowed repeatedly.

None of the gastroliths examined in a 2001 study of &quot;Cedarosaurus&quot; gastroliths had the &quot;soapy&quot; texture popularly used to distinguish gastroliths from other types of clast. The researchers dismissed using a soapy texture to identify gastroliths as &quot;unreliable&quot;. Gastroliths tended to be universally dull, although the colors represented were varied including black, dark brown, purplish red and grey-blue. Reflectance values greater than 50% are very diagnostic for identifying gastroliths. Clasts from beaches and streams tended to have reflectance values of less than 35%. Less than ten percent of beach clasts have reflectance values lying between 50 and 80%.
The American Museum of Natural History Photograph # 311488 demonstrates an articulated skeleton of a &quot;Psittacosaurus mongoliensis&quot;, from the Ondai Sair Formation, Lower Cretaceous Period of Mongolia, showing a collection of about 40 gastroliths inside the rib cage, about midway between shoulder and pelvis.

===Geologic distribution===

====Jurassic====
Gastroliths have sometimes been called Morrison stones because they are often found in the Morrison Formation (named after the town of Morrison, west of Denver, Colorado), a late Jurassic formation roughly 150 million years old. Some gastroliths are made of petrified wood. Most known instances of preserved sauropod gastroliths are from Jurassic animals.

====Cretaceous====
The Early Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation of Central Utah is full of highly polished red and black cherts, and other rounded quartzose clasts, which may partly represent gastroliths. The cherts may themselves contain fossils of ancient animals, such as corals. These stones do not appear to be associated with stream deposits and are rarely more than fist-sized, which is consistent with the idea that they are gastroliths.

===Sauropods===
Most known instances of preserved sauropod gastroliths are from Jurassic animals. The largest known gastroliths found in association with sauropod skeletons are approximately ten centimeters in length.

====&quot;Cedarosaurus weiskopfae&quot;====
In 2001 Frank Sanders, Kim Manley, and Kenneth Carpenter published a study on 115 gastroliths discovered in association with a &quot;Cedarosaurus&quot; specimen. The stones were identified as gastroliths on the basis of their tight spatial distribution, partial matrix support, and an edge-on orientation indicative of their being deposited while the carcass still had soft tissue. Their high surface reflectance values are consistent with other known dinosaur gastroliths. Nearly all of the &quot;Cedarosaurus&quot; gastroliths were found within a .06 m volume of space in the gut region of the skeleton.

The total mass of the gastroliths themselves was . Most were less than in volume. The least massive clast was and the most was , with most of them being toward the smaller end of that range. The clasts tended to be close to spherical in shape, although the largest specimens were also the most irregular. The largest gastroliths contributed the most to the total surface area of the set. Some gastroliths were so large and irregularly shaped that they may have been difficult to swallow. The gastroliths were mostly composed of chert, with some sandstone, siltstone, and quartzite clasts also included.

Since some of the most irregular gastroliths are also the largest, it is unlikely that they were ingested by accident. &quot;Cedarosaurus&quot; may have found irregular clasts to be attractive potential gastroliths or was not selective about shape. The clasts were generally of dull coloration, suggesting that color was not a major factor for the sauropod&#x27;s decision making. The high surface area to volume ratio of the largest clasts suggests that the gastroliths may have broken down ingested plant material by grinding or crushing it. The sandstone clasts tended to be fragile and some broke in the process of collection. The sandstone gastroliths may have been rendered fragile after deposition by loss of cement caused by the external chemical environment. If the clasts had been that fragile while the animal was alive, they probably rolled and tumbled in the digestive tract. If they were more robust, they could have served as part of a ball-mill system.

===Migration===
Paleontologists and geologists are researching new methods of identifying gastroliths that have been found disassociated from animal remains, because of the important information they can provide, if indeed they are trace fossils. If the validity of such gastroliths can be verified, it may be possible to trace gastrolithic rocks back to their original source area where the dinosaur first swallowed the rock. This may provide important information on how dinosaurs migrated. Because the number of suspected gastroliths is substantial, they might provide significant new information and insights into the lives and behaviour of dinosaurs.

<text>Dame Caroline Alice Spelman (&#x27;Cormack; born 4 May 1958) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Meriden in the West Midlands from 1997 to 2019. From May 2010 to September 2012 she was the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in David Cameron&#x27;s coalition cabinet, and was sworn as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010.

==Education==
Born in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, Spelman attended the Hertfordshire and Essex High School for Girls (now called The Hertfordshire and Essex High School), in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, and received a BA First Class in European Studies from Queen Mary College, University of London.
==Early career==
She was sugar beet commodity secretary for the National Farmers&#x27; Union from 1981 to 1984. She was deputy director of the International Confederation of European Beet Growers (officially known as &quot;La Confédération Internationale des Betteraviers Européens&quot; – CIBE) in Paris from 1984–9, then a research fellow for the Centre for European Agricultural Studies (part of the University of Kent and since 2000 known as the Centre for European Agri-Environmental Economics) from 1989 to 1993. She co-owns Spelman, Cormack &amp; Associates, a lobbying firm for the food and biotechnology industry, with her husband.

==Parliamentary career==

Before entering Parliament in 1997, she stood unsuccessfully in the Bassetlaw constituency in Nottinghamshire at the 1992 general election.

In 2001, Iain Duncan Smith appointed Spelman Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, a post she maintained until Duncan Smith&#x27;s departure as Conservative Party leader. Duncan Smith&#x27;s successor, Michael Howard, opted for a streamlined Shadow Cabinet and omitted Spelman; however, he later appointed her as a front bench spokeswoman on Environmental Affairs working for Theresa May. In March 2004, Spelman re-entered the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Local and Devolved Government Affairs, succeeding David Curry. Under David Cameron&#x27;s leadership of the Conservative Party, in 2007 she was promoted further to become Conservative Party Chairman.

In 2009, Spelman was moved in another reshuffle to the role of Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, replacing Eric Pickles.

Between 2010-2012, Spelman served as Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. In this role, she helped secure a UN agreement on biodiversity in Nagoya, and the Sustainable Development Goals agreement in Rio. In an interview with the Institute for Government, Spelman highlighted her Nature Environment White Paper laying out the Government&#x27;s vision to 2060, as one of her &quot;greatest achievements&quot; in office.

In 2012, Spelman returned to the Commons backbenches. 

Spelman served as Second Church Estates Commissioner from 2015 to 2019.

Spelman was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.

In January 2019 MPs approved a symbolic, non-binding amendment, tabled by Spelman, to prevent a no-deal Brexit, by 318 votes to 310.

Following abuse and death threats over Brexit, Spelman announced in September 2019 that she would not seek re-election at the next general election.

==Expenses==
In 2009, during the expenses scandal it was reported that Spelman had received £40,000 for cleaning and bills for her constituency home; this was despite her husband claiming it was their main home. In 2008 she reportedly over-claimed hundreds of pounds towards her council tax.

===&quot;Nannygate&quot; controversy===
On 6 June 2008, Spelman was the subject of controversy when it was suggested that for around twelve months from May 1997 she paid her child&#x27;s nanny, Tina Haynes, from her parliamentary staffing allowance, contrary to the rule governing such allowances and fears of the misuse of them. Spelman claims that her nanny also acted as her constituency secretary and was paid from the public taxpayers&#x27; purse for this aspect of her further employment. Haynes confirms that occasionally she would answer phone calls and post documents but initially she denied such happenings when interviewed on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; via telephone. The accusations came at a time when Conservative Party leader David Cameron had tasked Spelman with reviewing the use of parliamentary allowances by Conservative MPs and MEPs in the wake of the Derek Conway affair.

The allegation against Spelman came shortly after two Conservative MEPs, Giles Chichester (Leader of the Conservatives in the EU Parliament) and Den Dover (Conservative Chief Whip in the EU Parliament), were forced to resign amid claims they misused their parliamentary allowances. However, Spelman was not urged to resign by party leader, David Cameron. She referred the matter pertaining to herself, her nanny and parliamentary funds to John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Senior Conservative colleagues including former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis stated their support for Spelman.

New allegations were reported on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme that nine years previously Spelman&#x27;s secretary, Sally Hammond, complained to the Conservative Party leadership that she was using Parliamentary allowances to pay her nanny and that the arrangement with the nanny was over a two-year period and not one.

In March 2009, the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled that Caroline Spelman had misused her allowances to pay for nannying work in 1997 and 1998.

==Privacy injunction==
On 24 February 2012, the High Court in London refused to continue a privacy injunction previously granted to prevent the publication of a news item in the &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot; involving her son. Judge Michael Tugendhat said that the injunction was &quot;not necessary or proportionate&quot;. On 2 March 2012, the Spelmans decided not to appeal against the decision, which permitted the publication of a story about her son. The Spelman family was required to pay the legal costs of the &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot;, in addition to their own legal costs of £60,994.

==Personal life==
She married Mark Spelman, a senior partner at Accenture, on 25 April 1987 in south-east Kent. Her husband stood as a Conservative candidate in the 2009 European elections for the West Midlands region. They have two sons and a daughter. In 1997, Spelman was the only Conservative MP who was also a mother of school-age children; the Conservative party instructed that her children should be educated in her constituency as a condition of her selection as MP. As a result, Spelman rarely saw her children and she found this period of her life very stressful, losing a significant amount of weight.

The couple own a constituency home, a London townhouse and a villa in Algarve, Portugal.

She is a Patron of the Conservative Christian Fellowship.

Spelman was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for political and public service as part of the Resignation Honours of the outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron.

<text>Sir William David Wiggin (born 4 June 1966) is a former British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Herefordshire, previously Leominster, from 2001 to 2024.

==Early life and career==
Bill Wiggin was born on 4 June 1966 in London. He attended Eton College, where he was an older contemporary of David Cameron, and later read Economics at Bangor University, gaining a Bachelor of Arts in 1988. He also served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the Territorial Army, being a platoon commander for Holyhead, Bangor and Caernarfon.

Following this, Wiggin worked as a Trader in Foreign Exchange Options for UBS from 1991 to 1993, then was an Associate Director of Kleinwort Benson from 1994 to 1998, then as a manager in the Foreign Exchange department of Commerzbank from 1998.

==Parliamentary career==
Wiggin stood as the Conservative candidate for Burnley at the 1997 general election, coming second with 20.2% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Peter Pike. 

At the 2001 general election, Wiggin was elected to Parliament as MP for Leominster with 49% of the vote and a majority of 10,367.

Initially a backbencher, he became a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee in 2002. During 2003, Michael Howard appointed him to the position of Shadow Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Shadow Secretary of State for Wales.

Wiggin was re-elected as MP for Leominster at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 52.1% and an increased majority of 13,187. 

During his time Shadow Secretary of State for Wales the Conservatives won three seats in Wales at the 2005 general election, the first time Conservatives had been elected as MPs for Wales since the party had lost all its MPs in Wales at the 1997 election. Wiggin welcomed the gains, saying that &quot;Never again will Wales be a Conservative-free zone&quot;, although he admitted that while the wins were &quot;a good start&quot; he would have liked the Conservatives to have gained more Welsh seats. Wiggin also expressed regret at Howard&#x27;s decision to stand down as Conservative leader after the election, adding that he thought Howard had &quot;done a tremendous job&quot; and was &quot;a fantastic example to young Conservative MPs like myself&quot;. Despite Wiggin&#x27;s previous declaration, Wales has again been left without any Conservative MPs after the 2024 general election.

During parish council elections in Leominster during September 2009, Wiggin complained to the returning officer about the leaflets of a candidate who was standing to protest at Wiggin&#x27;s parliamentary expenses. The candidate, Jim Miller, was disqualified by the returning officer, who was also the chief executive of the Conservative-run Herefordshire County Council. This left the Conservative candidate unopposed. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Miller was disqualified over a technicality that the council previously told him had been resolved. The Mayor of Leominster expressed his astonishment at Wiggin&#x27;s intervention. &quot;I was just stunned that Wiggin contacted the returning officer. It&#x27;s not totally blatant, but what in god&#x27;s name is an MP doing poking his nose into a little parish election? I can&#x27;t understand what he thinks he&#x27;s up to&quot;.

Prior to the 2010 general election, Wiggin&#x27;s constituency of Leominster was abolished, and replaced with North Herefordshire. At the election, Wiggin was elected to Parliament as MP for North Herefordshire with 51.8% of the vote and a majority of 9,887.

In June 2013, Wiggin spoke in debate in favour of the badger cull, saying he supported the Government policy to &quot;combat&quot; bovine tuberculosis.

In May 2014, Wiggin met with Dafydd Evans, Environment Agency Area Manager for the West Midlands, to press for action to enhance local flood defences.

Wiggin renewed his call for more beds at Hereford County Hospital following a visit in September 2014, during which he toured one of the Canadian hutted units.

In December 2014, Wiggin questioned the Prime Minister David Cameron during PMQs about Hereford County Hospital and sought his support for increasing the hospital&#x27;s capacity. Following Wiggin&#x27;s question, the Prime Minister informed him that he would send a Minister to look at the Hospital. In February 2015 Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt paid a visit.

At the 2015 general election, Wiggin was re-elected as MP for North Herefordshire with an increased vote share of 55.8% and an increased majority of 19,996. Following the election, Wiggin was initially set to contest the Chairmanship of the Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs Select Committee against eventual chair Neil Parish. Instead Wiggin was subsequently appointed as Chair of the Committee of Selection. 

Wiggin was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 62% and an increased majority of 21,602.

He is a member of the European Research Group and signed a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May on 16 February 2018 regarding Brexit negotiations.

At the 2019 general election, Wiggin was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 63% and an increased majority of 24,856.

In January 2020, Wiggin has described the trend away from eating meat as &quot;a disaster for British agriculture.&quot; He has also advised MPs &quot;not to be fooled&quot; by arguments against chlorinated chicken.

He was knighted in the 2022 New Year Honours for political and public service.

In March 2022, Wiggin questioned Boris Johnson over his immigration record in the liaison committee and called on the prime minister to stop letting refugees ‘in rubber boats’ into the country ahead of Ukrainians and Qataris.

Wiggin was one of just two MPs, along with Christopher Chope, to oppose a Bill which proposed to ban the import of Hunting Trophies to the UK from Africa, calling it a &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;neocolonial&quot; piece of legislation which actually does not protect animals. 

In March 2024, Wiggin was re-selected as the Conservative candidate for North Herefordshire at the 2024 general election. He lost the election to the Green Party candidate, Dr Ellie Chowns, at 31.5% of the vote to Dr Chowns&#x27; 43.2%.

===Expenses claims===

During the parliamentary expenses scandal the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Wiggin had wrongly claimed more than £11,000 mortgage payments on his Herefordshire property. This property had no mortgage and Wiggin who had made 23 declarations that it was his main home said the expenses were claimed in error. The Committee found that Wiggin&#x27;s mortgage claims were the result of &quot;an unfortunate and unintended muddle&quot; which should have been picked up much more quickly, though no cost to the public purse resulted because Wiggin was entitled to claim for the mortgage payments on his London home. The committee expressed disappointment that Wiggin had not been cooperative with the enquiry as required by the Code of Conduct.

His claims for household bills were also investigated following a complaint. Wiggin had routinely claimed £240 a month for household bills and whilst the Standards and Privileges Committee confirmed that he could claim up to £250 a month without a receipt, this was to cover costs actually incurred.

Wiggin &quot;chose not to&quot; take up the committee&#x27;s invitation to check his expenses with his bank and service providers and, on balance of probability they found he overclaimed expenses for council tax, telephone and workmen&#x27;s bills.

In October 2010, Wiggin apologised to the House and was ordered to repay £4,009 utility expenses.

==Personal life==
Wiggin is the son of the late Sir Jerry Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare. He lives in Upton Bishop in South Herefordshire, with his wife Milly. She was previously the girlfriend of David Cameron. They have three children.

In addition to acting as a Trustee of the Eveson Charitable Trust, which assigns funding to support medical research and the disadvantaged, Wiggin is patron to several local charities. His interests include motorbikes, DIY, shooting, fishing and Hereford cattle.

<text>Herzog &amp; de Meuron Basel Ltd. is an international architecture firm headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, with additional offices in Berlin, Hong Kong, London, Munich, New York City, Paris, and San Francisco. Founded in 1978 by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, the practice&#x27;s portfolio includes more than 600 projects in 40 countries. The company is led by the founding partners along with senior partners Christine Binswanger, Ascan Mergenthaler, Stefan Marbach, Jason Frantzen, Andreas Fries, Wim Walschap, and the CEO, Adrian Keller, who collectively oversee the firm&#x27;s direction and management. Its staff comprises over 500 employees representing more than 50 nationalities.

== History and international recognition ==
Herzog &amp; de Meuron Basel Ltd. was founded in 1978 in Basel, Switzerland, by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, graduates of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in 1977. The firm initially gained recognition for minimalist designs and innovative use of materials, such as the Blue House in Oberwil (1980) and the Ricola Storage Building in Laufen (1987). Their international reputation grew in the 1990s with projects like the Goetz Collection in Munich (1992), which featured glass cladding to diffuse natural light, and the Dominus Winery in Napa Valley (1997), notable for its gabion walls of local stones that integrate the structure with its surroundings.

The transformation of London’s Bankside Power Station into the Tate Modern (2000) marked a turning point, blending industrial history with contemporary design. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised it as &quot;an example of how architecture can breathe new life into old structures.&quot; In 2001, Herzog &amp; de Meuron received the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, commended for their refined and innovative designs.

High-profile projects in the 2000s included the Beijing National Stadium (2008), known as the &quot;Bird’s Nest,&quot; created in collaboration with artist Ai Weiwei for the Summer Olympics. Other notable works included the REHAB Basel Clinic (2002), emphasizing light and openness for therapeutic recovery, and the Allianz Arena in Munich (2005), known for its dynamic ETFE façade. The Prada Aoyama store in Tokyo (2003) showcased experimental glass architecture.

In the 2010s, Herzog &amp; de Meuron continued delivering landmark projects like the Vitra-Haus in Weil am Rhein (2010) and the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg (2017), blending a wave-like glass structure with a historic brick warehouse. In New York, 56 Leonard Street (2017) featured a &quot;Jenga-like&quot; design, while the Powerhouse Arts building in Brooklyn (2023) highlighted their expertise in adaptive reuse.

In the 2020s, Herzog &amp; de Meuron’s work reflected a continued focus on innovation, sustainability, and cultural context. The M+ Museum in Hong Kong (2021) integrated LED lighting within a minimalist façade, and the Roche pRED Innovation Center in Basel (2023) showcased modular, sustainable design principles for interdisciplinary collaboration. Their healthcare projects include the Kinderspital in Zurich (2024), prioritizing natural materials, light, and healing environments, and ongoing facilities such as Hillerød Hospital in Denmark and UCSF Health Helen Diller Hospital in San Francisco.

Herzog &amp; de Meuron have been recognized globally, receiving the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 2015 for their &quot;profound contributions to architecture.&quot; Critic Jonathan Glancey summarized their impact: &quot;Their work combines the physical and poetic, the robust and refined.&quot;

== Firm structure and governance ==
Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron established Herzog &amp; de Meuron in Basel in 1978. Over the decades, the firm has expanded through the inclusion of new partners and leadership roles. The first partner, Harry Gugger, joined in 1991 (he left the practice in 2009), followed by Christine Binswanger in 1994. Additional partners have since joined the practice: Robert Hösl and Ascan Mergenthaler in 2004, Stefan Marbach in 2006, Andreas Fries in 2011, Jason Frantzen and Wim Walschap in 2014, Simon Demeuse in 2019, Santiago Espitia Berndt in 2020, and Martin Knüsel in 2021.

The firm has also introduced Associate Partners, with Christoph Röttinger, Olga Bolshanina, and Steffen Riegas taking on the role in 2020, followed by Tobias Winkelmann in 2021.

In 2017, Adrian Keller joined Herzog &amp; de Meuron as CEO, contributing to the firm’s continued organizational and operational development.

== Academia ==
Herzog &amp; de Meuron have been actively involved in academia, contributing to architectural education internationally. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron served as professors at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) from 1999 to 2018, where they co-founded the now discontinued ETH Studio Basel: Contemporary City Institute, focusing on urban studies and research. They have also held teaching roles as visiting professors at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, with Jacques Herzog having served as a visiting tutor at the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. Although they are no longer teaching full-time, they continue to give lectures at various institutions.

The firm has produced several publications that contribute to architectural discourse. &quot;Herzog &amp; de Meuron: Natural History&quot; (2002), co-authored with Philip Ursprung, explores the interplay between architecture and art through essays and detailed project analyses. &quot;Herzog &amp; de Meuron 1978–2007&quot; (2008) is a comprehensive monograph that documents the firm&#x27;s projects over nearly three decades, providing insights into their design processes and philosophies. Another notable work is &quot;The Complete Works&quot; series, which offers in-depth examinations of their projects, emphasizing conceptual approaches and material innovations.

Partners and associates of Herzog &amp; de Meuron actively engage in architectural education and discourse through participation in studio reviews and lectures at various academic institutions. For example, senior partner Ascan Mergenthaler has been involved in studio critiques and has lectured at the Royal College of Art in London, sharing insights on contemporary architectural practice. Senior partner Christine Binswanger has given talks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), discussing the firm&#x27;s approach to integrating environmental and social considerations in design. These activities allow the firm&#x27;s contributition to the education of emerging architects and to engage with current academic dialogues in architecture.

Herzog &amp; de Meuron have contributed to architectural discourse through several publications. &quot;The Inevitable Specificity of Cities&quot; (2015), co-authored among others by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, presents urban research conducted at ETH Studio Basel. The book explores the unique characteristics of cities worldwide, emphasizing the importance of local specificity in urban planning and development. In &quot;MetroBasel. Ein Modell einer europäischen Metropolitan-Region&quot; (2009), Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron, and Manuel Herz examine the Basel metropolitan area as a prototype for European metropolitan regions, discussing strategies for sustainable urban development and cross-border collaboration.

== Jacques Herzog und Pierre de Meuron Kabinett ==
The Kabinett is a charitable foundation established in Basel in 2015. It preserves and manages the extensive archives of the architects&#x27; works, including architectural drawings, sketches, models, and personal collections. The Kabinett is divided into three areas architecture, art, and photography, encompassing a wide range of materials and collections, such as the extensive Ruth and Peter Herzog collection of historic photography dating back to the early 19th century.

<text>Show Boat is a musical with music by Jerome Kern and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based on Edna Ferber&#x27;s best-selling 1926 novel of the same name. The musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot;, a Mississippi River show boat, over 40 years from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love. The musical contributed such classic songs as &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Make Believe&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot;.

The musical was first produced in 1927 by Florenz Ziegfeld. The premiere of &quot;Show Boat&quot; on Broadway was an important event in the history of American musical theatre. It &quot;was a radical departure in musical storytelling, marrying spectacle with seriousness&quot;, compared with the trivial and unrealistic operettas, light musical comedies and &quot;Follies&quot;-type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century. According to &quot;The Complete Book of Light Opera&quot;:Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now … the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now … came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.

The quality of &quot;Show Boat&quot; was recognized immediately by critics, and it is frequently revived. Awards did not exist for Broadway shows in 1927, when the show premiered, or in 1932 when its first revival was staged. Late 20th-century revivals of &quot;Show Boat&quot; have won both the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical (1995) and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival (1991).

==Background==
===Ferber and her novel &quot;Show Boat&quot;===
In April 1926, Edna Ferber&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, began publication in a serialized version in the magazine &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; (&quot;WHC&quot;). The complete book was released in August 1926 by Doubleday, Page and Company before the magazine series finished the following September. The work was unusual content for a women&#x27;s magazine of the period, with its inclusion of taboo subjects like infidelity, desertion, single motherhood, prostitution, gambling, and miscegenation. It was well received by both the public and the critics from the beginning, and the author received offers for film adaptations after the first two installments of the novel were published in &quot;WHC&quot;. It became a best-selling novel. 

It centers on Magnolia, the daughter of the owners of a showboat, &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot;, Captain Andy Hawks and his wife, Parthy. Musically gifted as a child, she learns from the ship&#x27;s performers and from the &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot;&#x27;s black cook Queenie and her husband, the dock worker Jo. Despite her mother&#x27;s opposition, Magnolia becomes an actress and singer on the boat&#x27;s stage. She falls in love with her co-star, gambler Gaylord Ravenal; they marry and have a child. Ravenal&#x27;s gambling addiction and huge debts, philandering with prostitutes, and ill health lead him to abandon his family. Magnolia manages to move on and thrive because of her prodigious singing talent; she is described as a white woman gifted with the singing voice of a black vocalist. Musicologist Todd Decker stated,
&quot;Magnolia&#x27;s embrace of show business as a means to survive as a single mother is directly linked to Ferber&#x27;s use of black music to characterize her heroine. Magnolia&#x27;s black voice thus proves a defining aspect of Ferber&#x27;s main character and a central pillar of the novel&#x27;s structure and larger themes. Magnolia&#x27;s story and the plot of &quot;Show Boat&quot; alike trace the course of American life across the divide separating the nineteenth century from the twentieth, an epochal shift felt with particular power in the 1920s when the effects of World War I and a series of overlapping transformations in daily life were altering the fabric of the nation.&quot;

Ferber&#x27;s novel was inspired by a conversation she had with the producer Winthrop Ames in 1924. Ames, to whom Ferber dedicated her novel, was producing Ferber&#x27;s play &quot;Minick&quot;, which was preparing for its Broadway debut; its tryout performances were not going well. Following a difficult day, Ames joked that they should all join a showboat if the play flopped. Ferber had never heard of a showboat, and her curiosity began her fascination with 19th century showboats on the Mississippi River. She began months of research and became an expert on the types of 19th-century paddle steamer ships active on the Mississippi. 
She boarded the James Adams Floating Palace Theatre in April 1925, leaving North Carolina, and spent five days on the ship while it traversed the Pamlico River. Ferber described the voyage as resulting in a &quot;treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true&quot;. Onboard, she attended rehearsals and took on jobs from selling and taking tickets to performing small roles. She also spoke with audience members. The ship&#x27;s captain, Charles Hunter, hosted the trip. Much of the world of the novel was based on stories he told to Ferber. One, involving a family of showboat performers with mixed-race children, were the basis for the novel&#x27;s subplot of the characters Julie and Steve. Julie, a mixed-race woman passing as white, and her white husband Steve broke miscegenation laws of the era by marrying.

Magnolia was a typical heroine of a novel by Ferber, who tended to base her female leads on herself. Magnolia is a confident woman who, with pluck and determination, succeeds in business without the help of a man. While the character marries, it is a failed marriage, and she rises above the weaknesses of her romantic partner who leaves her through tragic circumstances. Magnolia&#x27;s domineering mother Parthy was based on Ferber&#x27;s own mother, Julia Ferber, and Parthy and Captain Andy&#x27;s marriage was modeled on her own parents&#x27; marriage. &quot;Show Boat&quot; departed from Ferber&#x27;s earlier writings in that it was not set in an all-white mid-western town. Her decision to set the novel on a Mississippi River boat traveling south forced her to engage with race for the first time. While the central characters in Ferber&#x27;s novel are predominantly white, the inclusion of secondary characters like Julie, Jo, Queenie and various unnamed black characters, provide a view of a multiracial world. 

The novel often presents black figures in relation to music; frequent references to spirituals and other forms of music associated with African-Americans provide background for Magnolia&#x27;s musical journey. This choice reflected the increasing popularity in the 1920s of black singers performing spirituals on the concert stage in America. Influenced by the writings of ethnomusicologist Natalie Curtis, Ferber uses the theme of African-American music as a means of criticizing the state of contemporary white American theatre. At the end of the novel, Magnolia watches her daughter Kim study to become a singer and actress; only to have the life and soul of her talents driven out of her by the white music and theatre education system. Ferber implies that music from black culture is more authentic, intuitive, and superior in quality than white musical culture that is restrained by education. Decker wrote: &quot;In &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Ferber used a racial argument about the sources of musical inspiration and authentic voice to support her thesis about the source of inspired versus uninspired acting in the almost entirely white realm of Broadway theater.&quot;

===Adapting Ferber&#x27;s novel===

Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot; was an unlikely candidate for a musical adaptation in the 1920s: Its heroine&#x27;s unhappy marriage, her independence, and her grit in surviving as a single mother after being abandoned by a morally flawed husband ran counter to the typical portrayal of women in Broadway musicals as helpless victims who need rescuing. And Julie&#x27;s tragic subplot was far darker than Broadway musicals&#x27; typical content. Rather than ending with a happy marriage to her male rescuer, Ferber&#x27;s novel depicts Magnolia&#x27;s marriage as the source of her problems followed by her triumphant solo journey to independence and success. Nevertheless, the novel&#x27;s recurring music and entertainment themes made it an irresistible challenge for Kern and Hammerstein to adapt for the musical stage. After the 1925 success of the musical &quot;Sunny&quot; in collaboration with Hammerstein, Kern sought a new Broadway project for the pair. By late 1926 he was determined to make Ferber&#x27;s novel the subject of their next musical. Hammerstein agreed, and the pair began writing material even before obtaining permission from Ferber to use her work or having a producer attached to the project.

From the beginning they were determined to attract Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. as a backing producer, as they felt only he could mount a production large enough in scale to successfully portray Ferber&#x27;s story. They were aware that &quot;Show Boat&quot;, with its serious and dramatic nature, was an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues featuring romantic comedy, such as the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. Kern and Hammerstein worked to craft a piece that would sufficiently fill the Ziegfeld mold before approaching the producer. To make &quot;Show Boat&quot; fit the Ziegfeld brand, the pair transformed the novel into a romance, fundamentally changing Ferber&#x27;s tale of three generations of women in a family, Parthy, Magnolia, and Kim. Kern and Hammerstein eliminated much of Parthy and Captain Andy&#x27;s story, including Captain Andy&#x27;s death, both to lighten the tale and refocus the story on Magnolia&#x27;s relationship with Ravenal. They skipped Magnolia&#x27;s childhood and relationship with her mother, and rather than concentrating on the relationship with her daughter, the musical ends with her reconciliation with Ravenal, a redemptive and more romantic arc than in the novel. They also brightened Julie&#x27;s story somewhat and harmonized it with broader social themes.

Kern arranged an introduction to Ferber in October 1926 through their mutual friend, the critic Alexander Woollcott, during the intermission of Kern&#x27;s newest musical &quot;Criss Cross&quot;. Ferber was shocked by the proposal, concerned that the work was not suitable for the musical genre. She felt the work&#x27;s 50-year time span, and her treatment of topics like spousal desertion, alcoholism, and miscegenation did not fit the frivolous, light-hearted mold of popular musicals. She also knew that racially integrated casts of black and white actors and singers had never been attempted before on the Broadway stage. Ferber was finally won over by Kern and Hammersteins&#x27; assurance that the musical would not emulate the typical &quot;frivolous &#x27;girlie show&#x27;&quot; of the musical stage. On November 17, 1926, she signed a contract giving the creative duo the musical-dramatic rights to her novel. 

Kern and Hammerstein had mostly completed Act I of &quot;Show Boat&quot; prior to presenting their idea to Ziegfeld on November 25, 1926. They sold their idea to him partly by building material around specific talent, such as hiring vaudeville performers into the show and providing opportunities for a chorus that featured beautiful white women. They sought the star talents of African-American bass-baritone Paul Robeson. Robeson had achieved acclaim on the concert stage as a singer of spirituals and was an ideal choice to perform the spiritual-like music that reflected the music theme in Ferber&#x27;s novel. To attract him, they increased the prominence of the character Joe (spelled Jo in the novel). They shifted the novel&#x27;s use of the Mississippi River as a metaphor for Magnolia&#x27;s resilience to Joe through the hit song &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; to represent the resilience of the African-American laborer surviving in a racist society. The torch singer Helen Morgan was another star who Kern and Hammerstein envisioned from the beginning for the role of Julie. Knowing that Morgan&#x27;s popularity as nightclub singer would draw in crowds, they increased the size of the role in the musical. This also allowed Hammerstein to reshape the role into a sympathetic figure. In the novel, Julie is denounced for both her deception in passing as white and for her miscegenation. Hammerstein replaced this castigation with a sympathetic and affirming speech by Parthy in which the audience is led to see that Julie is unfairly condemned by a racist and immoral society. In this aspect, Hammerstein&#x27;s libretto becomes an anti-racist and politically engaged story in a way that was not done in Ferber&#x27;s novel. Julie&#x27;s song &quot;Bill&quot; became a &quot;musical and emotional high point&quot; in the production.

Upon hearing Act I of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, &quot;This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life&quot;. Though Ziegfeld planned to stage the premiere at the opening on his new Broadway theatre on Sixth Avenue, the epic scope of the work required an unusually long period of development. &quot;Show Boat&quot; went through numerous revisions during tryout performances. Additionally, Ziegfeld was concerned that the serious tone of the musical would not appeal to audiences and strongly disliked the songs &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; and &quot;Mis&#x27;ry&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Aroun&quot;. He ultimately decided to open the Ziegfeld Theatre in February 1927 with &quot;Rio Rita&quot;, a musical by Kern&#x27;s frequent collaborator Guy Bolton. When &quot;Rio Rita&quot; proved to be a success, &quot;Show Boat&quot;″s Broadway opening was delayed until &quot;Rita&quot; could be moved to another theatre.

==Synopsis==

;Act I
In 1887, the show boat &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot; arrives at the river dock in Natchez, Mississippi. The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules. The boat&#x27;s owner, Cap&#x27;n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee. A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve&#x27;s wife, the leading lady Julie La Verne. Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap&#x27;n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows.

A handsome riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia (&quot;Nolie&quot;) Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap&#x27;n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (&quot;Parthy&quot;). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal (&quot;Make Believe&quot;). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship&#x27;s cook. He replies that he has &quot;seen a lot like [Ravenal] on the river.&quot; As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, who does not seem to care what the world&#x27;s troubles are, but &quot;jes&#x27; keeps rollin&#x27; along&quot;. Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she is in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a &quot;no-account river feller&quot;. Magnolia says that if she found out he was &quot;no-account&quot;, she would stop loving him. Julie warns her that it is not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she will always love Steve and singing a few lines of &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot;. Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard &quot;colored folks&quot; sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.

During the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has &quot;black blood&quot; in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship&#x27;s pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap&#x27;n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.

Ravenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother&#x27;s objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. Weeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings &quot;You Are Love&quot;. They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap&#x27;n Andy calls Parthy &quot;narrow-minded&quot; and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds.

;Act II
Six years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a precarious living from Ravenal&#x27;s gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life (&quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot;) By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim, but first visits his daughter at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever (&quot;Make Believe&quot; (reprise)). Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year&#x27;s show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after being abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song &quot;Bill&quot;. She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing room, she hears Magnolia singing &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot; for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. Andy goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing-along of the standard, &quot;After the Ball&quot;. Magnolia becomes a great musical star.

More than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot; sings a reprise of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. Cap&#x27;n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot; with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot; Ravenal sings a reprise of &quot;You Are Love&quot; to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat&#x27;s gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;.

;Plot variants in 1951 film
The 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23 years later. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, he does not know that she is pregnant. Through a chance meeting with Julie, he learns that Magnolia and his daughter are living on the Cotton Blossom. He goes to where the boat is docked and sees Kim playing. He talks with her; the two &quot;make believe&quot; that he is her &quot;real daddy&quot;, and he weeps. Magnolia arrives and sends Kim aboard. She and Ravenal hesitate and then embrace, and she leads him onto the boat. Parthy is as happy as Captain Andy to see the reunion. Joe and the chorus sing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, and the ship heads down river. Julie watches from a distance and blows them a gentle kiss as the Cotton Blossom recedes.

===History of revisions===

The original production ran four-and-a-half hours during tryouts but was trimmed to just over three by the time it got to Broadway. During previews, four songs, &quot;Mis&#x27;ry&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Aroun&quot;, &quot;I Would Like to Play a Lover&#x27;s Part&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Start the New Year&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Hotter in the North&quot;, were cut from the show. The song &quot;Be Happy, Too&quot; was cut after the Washington, D.C., tryout. &quot;Let&#x27;s Start the New Year&quot; was performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production.

Two songs, &quot;Till Good Luck Comes My Way&quot; (sung by Ravenal) and &quot;Hey Feller!&quot; (sung by Queenie), were written mainly to cover scenery changes. They were discarded beginning with the 1946 revival, although &quot;Till Good Luck&quot; was included in the 1994 Prince revival. The comedy song, &quot;I Might Fall Back on You,&quot; was also cut beginning in 1946. It was restored in the 1951 film version and several stage productions since the 1980s.

The score also includes four songs not written for &quot;Show Boat&quot;: &quot;Bill&quot; was originally written by Kern and P. G. Wodehouse in 1917 and was reworked by Hammerstein for &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Two other songs not by Kern and Hammerstein, &quot;Goodbye, My Lady Love&quot; by Joseph E. Howard and &quot;After the Ball&quot; by Charles K. Harris, were included by the authors for historical atmosphere and are included in revivals. The New Year&#x27;s Eve scene features an instrumental version of &quot;There&#x27;ll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&quot;.

Some of the following numbers have been cut or revised in subsequent productions, as noted below (the songs &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot;, and &quot;Bill&quot; have been included in every stage and film production of &quot;Show Boat&quot;):
* Overture – The original overture, used in all stage productions up to 1946 is based chiefly on the deleted song &quot;Mis&#x27;ry&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Aroun&quot;, as Kern wanted to save this song in some form. The song was restored in the Prince 1994 revival of the show. The overture also contains fragments of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot;, and a faster arrangement of &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot; The overtures for the 1946 revival and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival consist of medleys of songs from the show. All three overtures were arranged by the show&#x27;s orchestrator, Robert Russell Bennett, who orchestrated most of Kern&#x27;s later shows.
* &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot; – This number is included in all the stage productions, and shorter versions were used in the 1936 and 1951 film versions.
* &quot;Where&#x27;s the Mate for Me?&quot; – Included in all stage versions, partially sung in the 1936 film version, and sung complete in the 1951 film version.
* &quot;Make Believe&quot; – Included in all stage versions, and in the 1936 and 1951 film versions.
* &quot;Life Upon the Wicked Stage&quot; – Included in all stage versions and the 1951 film version but heard in the 1936 film only in the orchestral score.
* &quot;Till Good Luck Comes My Way&quot; – Cut from the 1946 revival but reinstated in the 1971 London revival. It is performed instrumentally in the 1936 film.
* &quot;I Might Fall Back on You&quot; – Usually cut from 1946 until reinstated in 1966. Included in the 1951 film.
* &quot;C&#x27;mon Folks (Queenie&#x27;s Ballyhoo)&quot; – While included in all of the Broadway productions, it was cut from the original West End production after Alberta Hunter&#x27;s show-stopping performance of the song caused jealousy among her co-stars. It was sung in the prologue to the 1929 film version, and performed instrumentally in the 1951 film.
* &quot;Olio Dance&quot; – Usually cut, as it was composed to cover a change of scenery; this orchestral piece partially uses the melody of &quot;I Might Fall Back on You&quot;. The 1936 film substituted &quot;Gallivantin&#x27; Around&quot;, performed as an olio by Irene Dunne (as Magnolia) in blackface. Some modern productions move the song &quot;I Might Fall Back on You&quot; to this spot.
* &quot;You Are Love&quot; – Included in all stage productions, and shorter versions were used in both the 1936 and the 1951 films.
* &quot;Act I Finale&quot; – This was shortened in the 1936 film. Its midsection, banjo-dominant, buck-and-wing dance theme became a repeating motif in the 1951 film, played onstage during the backstage miscegenation scene, and later as a soft-shoe dance for Cap&#x27;n Andy and granddaughter Kim.
* &quot;At the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair&quot; – Used in all stage productions except for the Prince 1994 revival; an instrumental version was performed in the 1936 film.
* &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot; – Used in all stage versions, the song was originally written as a duet for Magnolia and Ravenal but was re-shaped as a solo for Parthy in the 1994 Broadway revival. A reprise of the song sung by the adult Kim in act 2 has often been omitted or replaced subsequent to the original Broadway production. Songs used as replacements include &quot;Dance Away the Night&quot; and &quot;Nobody Else But Me&quot;. &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot; was sung during the exit music to the 1929 film; it was performed only as background music for the 1936 film and was sung in the 1951 film version.
* &quot;In Dahomey&quot; – Cut from the score after the 1946 Broadway production and never revived as it is viewed as racially offensive and unnecessary to the plot. Sung at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair by a group of supposedly African natives who chant in a supposed African language before switching to English.
* &quot;Goodbye, My Lady Love&quot; – Used only in American productions and the 1936 film.
* &quot;After the Ball&quot; – Included in all stage productions and in both the 1936 and 1951 films.
* &quot;Hey, Feller&quot; – Used in the 1927 and 1932 Broadway productions but cut from the 1928 London production and the 1946 Broadway revival and the Prince in the 1994 revival. The song was sung in the prologue to the 1929 film. Used as background score in the 1951 film during the opening post-credits scene.
Additional numbers sometimes included in films and revivals:
*&quot;Mis&#x27;ry&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Aroun&quot; was published in the complete vocal score; fragments of it are heard in the score, notably in the original overture and the miscegenation scene. It was included in the 1994 Harold Prince revival.
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Start the New Year&quot; – Included in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production.
* &quot;Dance Away the Night&quot; was written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1928 West End production.
* &quot;I Have the Room Above Her&quot; was written by Kern and Hammerstein for Ravenal and Magnolia in the 1936 film. It was included in the 1994 Broadway revival.
* &quot;Gallivantin&#x27; Around&quot; was written by Kern and Hammerstein for Magnolia for the 1936 film.
* &quot;Ah Still Suits Me&quot; was written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film, sung by Joe and Queenie (Paul Robeson and Hattie McDaniel). Included in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production.
* &quot;Nobody Else but Me&quot; was written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1946 Broadway revival. This was the last song Kern ever wrote; he died shortly before the revival opened. In the 1971 London revival, the song was sung by Julie, in a new scene written for that production. It was frequently heard in revivals until about the 1980s.
* &quot;Dandies on Parade&quot; is a dance number arranged for the 1994 Broadway production by David Krane, largely from Kern&#x27;s music.

== Characters and notable casts==
==Production history==
===Original 1927 production===

Ziegfeld previewed the show in a pre-Broadway tour from November 15 to December 19, 1927. The locations included the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., the Nixon Theatre in Pittsburgh, the Ohio Theatre in Cleveland, and the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia. The show opened on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre on December 27, 1927. The critics were immediately enthusiastic, and the show was a great popular success, running a year and a half, for a total of 572 performances.

The production&#x27;s direction was credited to Zeke Colvan at the time it premiered, but Oscar Hammerstein II, who remained uncredited, was also responsible for much of the show&#x27;s staging. Choreography for the show was by Sammy Lee. The original cast included Norma Terris as Magnolia Hawks and her daughter Kim (as an adult), Howard Marsh as Gaylord Ravenal, Helen Morgan as Julie LaVerne, Jules Bledsoe as Joe, Charles Winninger as Cap&#x27;n Andy Hawks, Edna May Oliver as Parthy Hawks, Sammy White as Frank Schultz, Eva Puck as Ellie May Chipley, and Tess Gardella as Queenie. The orchestrator was Robert Russell Bennett, and the conductor was Victor Baravalle. The scenic design for the original production was by Joseph Urban, who had worked with Ziegfeld for many years in his &quot;Follies&quot; and had designed the elaborate new Ziegfeld Theatre itself. Costumes were designed by John Harkrider.

In his opening night review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson called the book&#x27;s adaptation &quot;intelligently made&quot;, and the production one of &quot;unimpeachable skill and taste&quot;. He termed Terris &quot;a revelation&quot;; Winninger &quot;extraordinarily persuasive and convincing&quot;; and Bledsoe&#x27;s singing &quot;remarkably effective&quot;.

===Paul Robeson===
The character Joe, the stevedore who sings &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, was expanded from the novel and written specifically by Kern and Hammerstein for Paul Robeson, already a noted actor and singer. Although he is the actor most identified with the role and the song, he was unavailable for the original production due to its opening delay. Jules Bledsoe premiered the part. Robeson played Joe in four notable productions of &quot;Show Boat&quot;: the 1928 London premiere production, the 1932 Broadway revival, the 1936 film version and a 1940 stage revival in Los Angeles.

Reviewing the 1932 Broadway revival, the critic Brooks Atkinson described Robeson&#x27;s performance: &quot;Mr. Robeson has a touch of genius. It is not merely his voice, which is one of the richest organs on the stage. It is his understanding that gives &#x27;Old Man River&#x27; an epic lift. When he sings ... you realize that Jerome Kern&#x27;s spiritual has reached its final expression.&quot;

===North American revivals===

After closing at the Ziegfeld Theatre in 1929, the original production toured extensively. The national company is notable for including Irene Dunne as Magnolia. Hattie McDaniel played Queenie in a 1933 West Coast production, joined by tenor Allan Jones as Ravenal. &quot;Show Boat&quot; was revived by Ziegfeld on Broadway in 1932 at the Casino Theatre with most of the original cast, but with Paul Robeson as Joe and Dennis King as Ravenal.

In 1946, a major new Broadway revival was produced by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II at the show&#x27;s original home, the Ziegfeld Theatre. The 1946 revival featured a revised score and new song by Kern and Hammerstein, and a new overture and orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett. The show was directed by Hammerstein and Hassard Short and featured Jan Clayton (Magnolia), Charles Fredricks (Ravenal), Carol Bruce (Julie), Kenneth Spencer (Joe), Helen Dowdy (Queenie), and Buddy Ebsen (Frank). Kern died just weeks before the January 5, 1946 opening, making it the last show he worked on. The production ran for 418 performances and then toured extensively. Its cost was reportedly $300,000, and a month before the Broadway closing, it was reported as still $130,000 from breaking even.

Additional New York revivals were produced in 1948 and 1954 at the New York City Center with the 1948 production starred Billy House as Cap&#x27;n Andy. The 1954 production was mounted by the New York City Opera with Burl Ives (Cap&#x27;n Andy), Laurel Hurley (Magnolia), Robert Rounseville (Ravenal), Helena Bliss (Julie), Marjorie Gateson (Parthy), Boris Aplon (Pete), Lawrence Winters (Joe), and Helen Phillips (Queenie) The Music Theatre of Lincoln Center company produced &quot;Show Boat&quot; in 1966 at the New York State Theater in a new production. It starred Barbara Cook (Magnolia), Constance Towers (Julie), Stephen Douglass (Ravenal), David Wayne (Cap&#x27;n Andy), Margaret Hamilton (Parthy) and William Warfield (Joe). It was produced by Richard Rodgers, and Robert Russell Bennett once again provided a new overture and revised orchestrations.

The Houston Grand Opera staged a revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot; that premiered at Jones Hall in Houston in June 1982 and then toured to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C., and finally to the Gershwin Theatre on Broadway in 1983. The production also toured overseas to the Cairo Opera House in Egypt. The show was produced by Robert A. Buckley and Douglas Urbanski. Mickey Rooney portrayed Cap&#x27;n Andy for portions of the tour, but Donald O&#x27;Connor took over the role on Broadway. Lonette McKee (Julie) and Karla Burns (Queenie), and director Michael Kahn all received Tony Award nominations for their work. Other cast members included Ron Raines (Gaylord Ravenal), Sheryl Woods (Magnolia), Avril Gentles (Parthy), Bruce Hubbard (Joe), and Paige O&#x27;Hara (Ellie).

In 1989, the Paper Mill Playhouse of Millburn, New Jersey, mounted a production which was noted for its intention to restore the show in accordance with the creators&#x27; original intentions. The production restored part of the original 1927 overture and one number discarded from the show after the Broadway opening, as well as the song &quot;Ah Still Suits Me&quot;, written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version. It was directed by Robert Johanson and starred Eddie Bracken as Cap&#x27;n Andy. The Paper Mill production was preserved on videotape and broadcast on PBS.

===Toronto (1993, later Broadway)===
Livent Inc. produced &quot;Show Boat&quot; in Toronto in 1993, starring Rebecca Luker as Magnolia, Mark Jacoby as Ravenal, Lonette McKee as Julie, Robert Morse as Cap&#x27;n Andy, Elaine Stritch as Parthy, Michel Bell as Joe and Gretha Boston as Queenie. Co-produced and directed by Harold Prince and choreographed by Susan Stroman, closing in June 1995. A Broadway production opened at the George Gershwin Theatre on October 2, 1994, and continued for 947 performances making it Broadway&#x27;s longest-running &quot;Show Boat&quot; to date. It starred most of the Toronto cast, but with John McMartin as Cap&#x27;n Andy. Robert Morse remained in the Toronto cast and was joined by Cloris Leachman as Parthy, Patti Cohenour as Magnolia, Hugh Panaro as Ravenal, and Valerie Pettiford as Julie.

The production departed from previous iterations by tightening the book, dropping or adding songs used in or cut from various productions, and highlighting its racial elements. Prince transformed &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot; from a duet between Magnolia and Ravenal to a lullaby sung by Parthy to Magnolia&#x27;s baby girl, and then reprised as an up-tempo production number finale. The love duet for Magnolia and Ravenal, &quot;I Have the Room Above Her&quot;, written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film, was added to the production. Two new mime and dance &quot;Montages&quot; in Act 2 depicted the passage of time through changing styles of dance and music. The production went on tour, playing at the Kennedy Center, and it was staged in London (1998) and Melbourne, Australia.

===London productions===
The original London West End production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; opened May 3, 1928, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and featured among the cast, Cedric Hardwicke as Capt. Andy, Edith Day as Magnolia, Paul Robeson as Joe, and Alberta Hunter as Queenie. Mabel Mercer, later famed as a cabaret singer, was in the chorus. Other West End presentations include a 1971 production at the Adelphi Theatre, which ran for 909 performances. Derek Royle was Cap&#x27;n Andy, Cleo Laine was Julie, and Pearl Hackney played Parthy Ann.

The Hal Prince production ran at the Prince Edward Theatre in 1998, and was nominated for the Olivier Award, Outstanding Musical Production (1999). Other notable revivals in England have included the joint Opera North/Royal Shakespeare Company production of 1989, which ran at the London Palladium in 1990, and the 2006 production directed by Francesca Zambello, presented by Raymond Gubbay at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. It was the first fully staged musical production in the history of that venue. Karla Burns, who had appeared as Queenie in the 1983 Broadway revival, reprised the role for the Opera North and RSC production, becoming the first black performer to win the Laurence Olivier Award.

A production was transferred from Sheffield&#x27;s Crucible Theatre to London&#x27;s New London Theatre with previews beginning on April 9, 2016, and an official opening on April 25, 2016. It was directed by Daniel Evans using the Goodspeed Musicals version of the show. The cast included Gina Beck as Magnolia, Lucy Briers as Parthy Ann and Malcolm Sinclair as Cap&#x27;n Andy. Despite very favorable reviews, the show closed at the end of August 2016.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
&quot;Show Boat&quot; has been adapted for film three times, and for television once.
* 1929 &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Universal. Released in silent and partial sound versions. Not a film version of the musical; its plot is based on the original Edna Ferber novel. Immediately after the silent film was completed, a prologue with some music from the show was filmed and added to a part-talkie version of the same film, which was released with two sound sequences.
* 1936 &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Universal. Directed by James Whale. A mostly faithful film version of the show, featuring four members of the original Broadway cast, as well as Irene Dunne, who had appeared in the national tour. Other cast members from stage productions included Jones as Ravenal, McDaniel as Queenie, Robeson as Joe, Winninger as Cap&#x27;n Andy, Morgan as Julie and White as Frank. Screenplay by Oscar Hammerstein II; music arrangements by Robert Russell Bennett; music direction and conducting by Victor Baraville.
* 1946 &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;. MGM. In this fictionalized film biography of composer Jerome Kern (played by Robert Walker), &quot;Show Boat&quot;&#x27;s 1927 opening night on Broadway is depicted in a lavishly staged fifteen-minute medley of six of the show&#x27;s songs. The number features Kathryn Grayson, Tony Martin, Lena Horne, Virginia O&#x27;Brien, Caleb Peterson, and William Halligan as, respectively, Magnolia, Ravenal, Julie, Ellie, Joe, and Cap&#x27;n Andy.
* 1951 &quot;Show Boat&quot;. MGM. Somewhat revised Technicolor film version. Follows the basic storyline and contains many songs from the show but makes many changes in the details of plot and character. The most financially successful and frequently revived of the three film versions.
* 1989 A live performance by the Paper Mill Playhouse was videotaped for television and shown on Great Performances on PBS. It contains more of the songs (and fewer cuts) than any of the film versions. It includes the choral number &quot;Let&#x27;s Start the New Year&quot;, which was dropped from the show before its Broadway opening, and &quot;Ah Still Suits Me&quot;, a song written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version of the show.

===Radio===
&quot;Show Boat&quot; was adapted for live radio at least seven times. Due to network censorship rules, many of the radio productions eliminated the miscegenation aspect of the plot. Notable exceptions were the 1940 &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; broadcast and the 1952 &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast.

* &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and introduced by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical version of the story that was based more closely on Ferber&#x27;s novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap&#x27;n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.
* &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; (NBC Radio, May 28, 1940). A half-hour dramatization with Jeanette Nolan, John McIntire, Agnes Moorehead and the Ken Christy Chorus. Although brief, it was remarkably faithful to the original show.
* &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; (CBS, June 1940). Introduced and produced by Cecil B. DeMille, it featured Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, and Charles Winninger, all of whom were in the 1936 film version. In this condensed version some songs from the show were sung, but Julie was played by a non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only a few lines of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used the ending of the original show, which the film did not use.
* &quot;Radio Hall of Fame&quot; (1944). This production featured Kathryn Grayson, playing Magnolia for the first time. Also in the cast were Allan Jones as Ravenal, Helen Forrest as Julie, Charles Winninger as Cap&#x27;n Andy, Ernest Whitman as Joe, and Elvia Allman as Parthy.
* &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot; (ABC Radio, 1950). Condensed to a half-hour, this version featured singers Dorothy Kirsten, Gordon MacRae, and Lucille Norman. &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; was sung by MacRae instead of by an African-American singer. Explanation of Julie and Steve&#x27;s departure went completely unmentioned in this version.
* &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; (CBS, February 11, 1952). A radio version of the 1951 MGM film featuring Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and William Warfield from the film&#x27;s cast. Jay C. Flippen portrayed Cap&#x27;n Andy. This version was extremely faithful to the 1951 film adaptation.
* In 2011, a two-part version was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the Classic Serial spot. Solely based on the novel by Edna Ferber, it was dramatized by Moya O&#x27;Shea, and was produced and directed by Tracey Neale. It starred Samantha Spiro as Magnolia, Ryan McCluskey as Ravenal, Nonso Anozie as Joe, Tracy Ifeachor as Queenie, Laurel Lefkow as Parthy, Morgan Deare as Cap&#x27;n Andy and Lysette Anthony as Kim. Original music was by Neil Brand.
* On June 16, 2012, a revival of the musical by Lyric Opera of Chicago was broadcast by WFMT-Radio of Chicago. This production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; reinstated the songs &quot;Mis&#x27;ry&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Round&quot;, &quot;Till Good Luck Comes My Way&quot; and &quot;Hey, Feller!&quot; It marked the first time a virtually complete version of &quot;Show Boat&quot; had ever been broadcast on radio.

===Concert hall===
*On December 29, 1941, the Cleveland Orchestra, under the direction of Artur Rodziński, premiered and recorded the orchestral work &quot;Show Boat: A Scenario for Orchestra&quot; which was crafted by Kern. A 22-minute orchestral work weaving together themes from the show, it was later recorded by John Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra on the 1996 album &quot;The Hollywood Bowl on Broadway&quot;.

* 1928 – original London cast album, with the show&#x27;s original orchestrations. This was released in England on 78 rpm records years before being sold in the United States. As the U.S. had not yet begun making original cast albums of Broadway shows, the 1927 Broadway cast as a whole was never recorded performing the songs, although Jules Bledsoe, Helen Morgan, and Tess Gardella did record individual numbers from it. The cast on the 1928 London album included Edith Day, Howett Worster, Marie Burke and Alberta Hunter. Due to contractual restrictions, cast member Paul Robeson was replaced on the album as Joe by his understudy, baritone Norris Smith. But that same year, Robeson, with the same chorus that accompanied him in the show, did record &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in its original orchestration. That recording was later released separately. His rendition appears on the EMI CD &quot;Paul Robeson Sings &#x27;Ol&#x27; Man River&#x27; and Other Favorites&quot;.
* 1932 – studio cast recording on 78rpm by Brunswick Records. Later re-released by Columbia Records on 78rpm, 33-1/3rpm and briefly on CD. This recording featured Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, James Melton, Frank Munn, and Countess Olga Albani, and was issued in conjunction with the 1932 revival of the show, although it was not strictly an &quot;original cast&quot; album of that revival. The orchestra was conducted by Victor Young, and the original orchestrations and vocal arrangements were not used.
* 1946 – Broadway revival cast recording. Issued on 78rpm, LP and CD. The 78-RPM and LP versions were issued by Columbia, the CD by Sony. This was the first American recording of &quot;Show Boat&quot; which used the cast, conductor, and orchestrations of a major Broadway revival of the show. (Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s orchestrations for this revival thoroughly modified his original 1927 orchestrations.) Jan Clayton, Carol Bruce, Charles Fredericks, Kenneth Spencer, and Collette Lyons were featured. Buddy Ebsen also appeared in the revival, but not on the album. Includes the new song &quot;Nobody Else But Me&quot;.
* 1951 – MGM Records soundtrack album, with cast members of the 1951 film version. The first film soundtrack of &quot;Show Boat&quot; to be issued on records. Appeared both on 45rpm and 33-1/3rpm, later on CD in a much expanded edition. Actress Ava Gardner, whose singing voice was replaced by Annette Warren&#x27;s in the film, is heard singing on this album. The expanded version on CD contains both Warren&#x27;s and Gardner&#x27;s vocal tracks. This marked the recording debut of William Warfield, who played Joe and sang &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in the film. Orchestrations were by Conrad Salinger, Robert Franklyn, and Alexander Courage.
* 1956 – RCA Victor studio cast album conducted by Lehman Engel. This album featured more of the score on one LP than had been previously recorded. It featured a white singer, famed American baritone Robert Merrill, as both Joe and Gaylord Ravenal. Other singers included Patrice Munsel as Magnolia and Rise Stevens as Julie. Issued on CD in 2009, but omitting Frank and Ellie&#x27;s numbers, which had been sung on the LP version by Janet Pavek and Kevin Scott. The original orchestrations were not used.
* 1958 – RCA Victor studio cast album. The first &quot;Show Boat&quot; in stereo, this recording starred Howard Keel (singing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; as well as Gaylord Ravenal&#x27;s songs), Anne Jeffreys, and Gogi Grant, and did not use the original orchestrations. It was issued on CD in 2010.
* 1959 – EMI British studio cast album. It featured Marlys Walters as Magnolia, Don McKay as Ravenal, Shirley Bassey as Julie, Dora Bryan as Ellie, and Inia Te Wiata singing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;.
* 1962 – Columbia studio cast album. Starring Barbara Cook, John Raitt, Anita Darian, and William Warfield, this was the first &quot;Show Boat&quot; recording issued on CD. Although Robert Russell Bennett was uncredited, this used several of his orchestrations for the 1946 revival of the show, together with some modifications.
* 1966 – Lincoln Center cast album. Issued by RCA Victor, it featured Cook, Constance Towers, Stephen Douglass, and William Warfield. Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s orchestrations were modified even further. Also available on CD.
* 1971 – London revival cast album. Jazz singer Cleo Laine, soprano Lorna Dallas, tenor Andre Jobin, and bass-baritone Thomas Carey were the leads. It used completely new orchestrations bearing almost no resemblance to Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s. This was the first 2-LP album of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. It included more of the score than had been previously put on records. Issued later on CD.
* 1987 – complete EMI studio recording. This is a three-CD set which, for the first time, is of the entire score, with the authentic 1927 orchestrations, uncensored lyrics, and vocal arrangements. The cast includes Frederica von Stade, Jerry Hadley, Teresa Stratas, Karla Burns, Bruce Hubbard, David Garrison and Paige O&#x27;Hara, conducted by John McGlinn.
* 1993 – Toronto revival cast recording, with the same cast as the 1994 Broadway production.

There have been many other studio cast recordings of &quot;Show Boat&quot; in addition to those mentioned above. The soundtrack of the 1936 film version has appeared on a so-called &quot;bootleg&quot; CD label called Xeno.

==Racial issues==
===Integration===
&quot;Show Boat&quot; boldly portrayed racial issues and was the first racially integrated musical, in that both black and white performers appeared and sang on stage together.
 Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; featured solo African American performers such as Bert Williams, but would not have included a black woman in the chorus. &quot;Show Boat&quot; was structured with two choruses – a black chorus and a white chorus. Ethnomusicologist Richard Keeling noted that &quot;Hammerstein uses the African-American chorus as essentially a Greek chorus, providing clear commentary on the proceedings, whereas the white choruses sing of the not-quite-real.&quot; In &quot;Show Boat&quot; Jerome Kern used the AABA-chorus form exclusively in songs sung by African-American characters (&quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot;), a form that later would be regarded as typical of &quot;white&quot; popular music.

&quot;Show Boat&quot; was the first Broadway musical to seriously depict an interracial marriage, as in Ferber&#x27;s original novel, and to feature a character of mixed race who was &quot;passing&quot; for white.

===Language and stereotypes===
====The word &quot;nigger&quot;====
The show has generated controversy for the subject matter of interracial marriage, the historical portrayal of blacks working as laborers and servants in the 19th-century South, and the use of the word &quot;niggers&quot; in the lyrics (this is the first word in the opening chorus of the show). Originally the show opened with the black chorus onstage singing:

::Niggers all work on the Mississippi,
::Niggers all work while the white folks play.
::Loadin&#x27; up boats wid de bales of cotton,
::Gittin&#x27; no rest till de Judgment Day.

In subsequent productions, &quot;niggers&quot; has been changed to &quot;colored folk&quot;, to &quot;darkies&quot;, and in one choice, &quot;Here we all&quot;, as in &quot;Here we all work on the Mississippi. Here we all work while the white folks play.&quot; In the 1966 Lincoln Center production of the show, produced two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, this section of the opening chorus was omitted rather than having words changed. The 1971 London revival used &quot;Here we all work on the Mississippi&quot;. The 1988 CD for EMI restored the original 1927 lyric, while the Harold Prince revival chose &quot;colored folk&quot;. The Paper Mill Playhouse production, videotaped and telecast by PBS in 1989, used the word &quot;nigger&quot; when said by an unsympathetic character, but otherwise used the word &quot;Negro&quot;.

Many critics believe that Kern and Hammerstein wrote the opening chorus to give a sympathetic voice to an oppressed people, and that they intended its use in an ironic way, as it had so often been used in a derogatory way. They wanted to alert the audience to the realities of racism:

&quot;&#x27;Show Boat&quot; begins with the singing of that most reprehensible word – nigger – yet this is no coon song... [it] immediately establishes race as one of the central themes of the play. This is a protest song, more ironic than angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers&#x27; hands, the word nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the white folks and denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built into the very language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective scene... These are not caricature roles; they are wise, if uneducated, people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them.

The racial situations in the play provoke thoughts of how hard it must have been to be black in the South. In the dialogue, some of the blacks are called &quot;niggers&quot; by the white characters in the story. (Contrary to what is sometimes thought, black slavery is not depicted in the play; U.S. slavery was abolished by 1865, and the story runs from the 1880s to the late 1920s.) At first, it is shocking to believe they are allowed to use a word that negative at all in a play... But in the context in which it is used, it is appropriate due to the impact it makes. It reinforces how much of a derogatory term &quot;nigger&quot; was then and still is today.

The word has not been used in any of the film versions of the musical. In the show, the sheriff refers to Steve and Julie as having &quot;nigger blood.&quot; In the 1936 and 1951 film versions, this was changed to &quot;Negro blood&quot;. Likewise, the unsympathetic Pete calls Queenie a &quot;nigger&quot; in the stage version but refers to her as &quot;colored&quot; in the 1936 film, and does not use either word in the 1951 film.

====African-American English====
Those who consider &quot;Show Boat&quot; racially insensitive often note that the dialogue and lyrics of the black characters (especially the stevedore Joe and his wife Queenie) and choruses use various forms of African American Vernacular English. An example of this is shown in the following text:

::Hey!
::Where yo&#x27; think you&#x27;re goin&#x27;?
::Don&#x27;t yo&#x27; know dis show is startin&#x27; soon?
::Hey!
::Jes&#x27; a few seats left yere!
::It&#x27;s light inside an&#x27; outside dere&#x27;s no moon
::What fo&#x27; you gals dressed up dicty?
::Where&#x27;s yo&#x27; all gwine?
::Tell dose stingy men o&#x27; yourn
::To step up here in line!

Whether or not such language is an accurate reflection of the vernacular of black people in Mississippi at the time, the effect of its usage has offended some critics, who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes. The character Queenie (who sings the above verses) in the original production was played not by an African American but by the Italian-American actress Tess Gardella in blackface (Gardella was perhaps best known for portraying Aunt Jemima in blackface). Attempts by non-black writers to imitate black language stereotypically in songs such as &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; were alleged to be offensive, a claim that was repeated eight years later by critics of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. However, such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein&#x27;s intentions were noble, since &quot;&#x27;Ol&#x27; Man River&#x27; was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice, compressing the suffering, resignation, and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it so naturally that it&#x27;s no wonder folks assume the song&#x27;s a Negro spiritual.&quot;

The theatre critics and veterans Richard Eyre and Nicholas Wright believe that &quot;Show Boat&quot; was revolutionary, not only because it was a radical departure from the previous style of plotless revues, but because it was a show by non-black writers that portrayed black people sympathetically rather than condescendingly:Instead of a line of chorus girls showing their legs in the opening number singing that they were happy, happy, happy, the curtain rose on black dock-hands lifting bales of cotton and singing about the hardness of their lives. Here was a musical that showed poverty, suffering, bitterness, racial prejudice, a sexual relationship between black and white, a love story which ended unhappily – and of course show business. In &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; the black race was given an anthem to honor its misery that had the authority of an authentic spiritual.

===Revisions and cancellations===
Since the musical&#x27;s 1927 premiere, &quot;Show Boat&quot; has both been condemned as a prejudiced show based on racial caricatures and championed as a breakthrough work that opened the door for public discourse in the arts about racism in America. Some productions (including one planned for June 2002 in Connecticut) have been cancelled because of objections. Such cancellations have been criticized by supporters of the arts. After planned performances in 1999 by an amateur company in Middlesbrough, England, where &quot;the show would entail white actors &#x27;blacking up&#x27;&quot; were &quot;stopped because [they] would be &#x27;distasteful&#x27; to ethnic minorities&quot;, the critic for a local newspaper declared that the cancellation was &quot;surely taking political correctness too far. … [T]he kind of censorship we&#x27;ve been talking about – for censorship it is – actually militates against a truly integrated society, for it emphasizes differences. It puts a wall around groups within society, dividing people by creating metaphorical ghettos, and prevents mutual understanding&quot;.

As attitudes toward race relations have changed, producers and directors have altered some content to make the musical more &quot;politically correct&quot;: &quot;&quot;Show Boat&quot;, more than many musicals, was subject to cuts and revisions within a handful of years after its first performance, all of which altered the dramatic balance of the play.&quot;

===1993 revival===
The 1993 Hal Prince revival, originating in Toronto, was deliberately staged to cast attention on racial disparities; throughout the production, African-American actors constantly cleaned up messes, appeared to move the sets (even when hydraulics actually moved them), and performed other menial tasks. After a New Year&#x27;s Eve ball, all the streamers fell on the floor and African Americans immediately began sweeping them away. A montage in the second act showed time passing using the revolving door of the Palmer House in Chicago, with newspaper headlines being shown in quick succession, and snippets of slow motion to highlight a specific moment, accompanied by brief snippets of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. African-American dancers were seen performing a specific dance, and this would change to a scene showing white dancers performing the same dance. This was meant to illustrate how white performers &quot;appropriated&quot; the music and dancing styles of African Americans. Earlier productions of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, even the 1927 stage original and the 1936 film version, did not go this far in social commentary.

During the Toronto production, many black community leaders and their supporters expressed opposition to the show, protesting in front of the theatre, &quot;shouting insults and waving placards reading &quot;Show Boat&quot; Spreads Lies and Hate and &quot;Show Boat&quot; = Cultural Genocide&quot;. Various theatre critics in New York, however, commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production to show its injustice, as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks. A critic noted that he included &quot;an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie [&quot;Mis&#x27;ry&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Round&quot;] ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus. The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine for a brief moment on the center stage of the showboat&quot;.

===Analysis===
Many commentators, both black and non-black, view the show as an outdated and stereotypical commentary on race relations that portrays blacks in a negative or inferior position. Douglass K. Daniel of Kansas State University has commented that it is a &quot;racially flawed story&quot;, and the African-Canadian writer M. NourbeSe Philip claims:

The affront at the heart of &quot;Show Boat&quot; is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its negative and one-dimensional images of Black people and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol&#x27; man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don&#x27;t represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.

Supporters of the musical believe that the depictions of racism should be regarded not as stereotyping blacks but rather satirizing the common national attitudes that both held those stereotypes and reinforced them through discrimination. In the words of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; theatre critic John Lahr:Describing racism doesn&#x27;t make &quot;Show Boat&quot; racist. The production is meticulous in honoring the influence of black culture not just in the making of the nation&#x27;s wealth but, through music, in the making of its modern spirit.

As described by Joe Bob Briggs:Those who attempt to understand works like &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; through the eyes of their creators usually consider that the show &quot;was a statement AGAINST racism. That was the point of Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel. That was the point of the show. That&#x27;s how Oscar wrote it...I think this is about as far from racism as you can get.&quot;

According to Rabbi Alan Berg, Kern and Hammerstein&#x27;s score to &quot;Show Boat&quot; is &quot;a tremendous expression of the ethics of tolerance and compassion&quot;. As Harold Prince (not Kern, to whom the quote has been mistakenly attributed) states in the production notes to his 1993 production of the show:

Throughout pre-production and rehearsal, I was committed to eliminate any inadvertent stereotype in the original material, dialogue which may seem &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; today... However, I was determined not to rewrite history. The fact that during the 45-year period depicted in our musical there were lynchings, imprisonment, and forced labor of the blacks in the United States is irrefutable. Indeed, the United States still cannot hold its head high with regard to racism.

Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s commitment to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to &quot;Show Boat&quot;. It can be seen in his later works, many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers. &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime, and &quot;South Pacific&quot; explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, &quot;The King and I&quot; deals with different cultures&#x27; preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.

Regarding the original author of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Ann Shapiro states thatEdna Ferber was taunted for being Jewish; as a young woman eager to launch her career as a journalist, she was told that the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; did not hire women reporters. Despite her experience of antisemitism and sexism, she idealized America, creating in her novels an American myth where strong women and downtrodden men of any race prevail... &quot;[Show Boat]&quot; create[s] visions of racial harmony... in a fictional world that purported to be America but was more illusion than reality. Characters in Ferber&#x27;s novels achieve assimilation and acceptance that was periodically denied Ferber herself throughout her life.

Whether or not the show is racist, many contend that productions of it should continue as it serves as a history lesson of American race relations. According to African-American opera singer Phillip Boykin, who played the role of Joe in a 2000 tour,

<text>Milan Kučan (; born 14 January 1941) is a Slovenian former politician who served as the first President of Slovenia from 1991 to 2002. Before being president of Slovenia, he was the 13th President of the Presidency of SR Slovenia from 1990 to 1991.

Kučan also served as the 7th President of the League of Communists of Slovenia from 1986 to 1989.

==Early life and political beginnings==
Kučan, one of five children, was born in a teachers&#x27; family. His parents were Koloman Küčan (1911–1944) and Marija Varga (1917–1975). He was raised in the village of Križevci, located in the largely agrarian border region of Prekmurje in the Drava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Slovenia). His father Koloman died during World War II. Kučan&#x27;s family spent World War II in occupied Serbia, where over 58,000 other Slovenians were resettled from Slovenia by the Nazis.

He later studied law at the University of Ljubljana and soon became involved in the Communist political organizations of the time. In 1968, he became the president of the Slovenian Youth Association, then secretary of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Slovenia (a central organization, created to unite all civil society associations under one roof) between 1974 and 1978. He rose to speaker of the National Assembly of Slovenia in 1978, and in 1982 he became representative for the Slovenian Communists in the League of Communists of Yugoslavia&#x27;s Central Committee in Belgrade.

In May 1986, he became the leader of the League of Communists of Slovenia. At that time, liberal and democratic sentiment started to grow in Slovenia, as opposed to the political atmosphere of Belgrade and Serbia under Slobodan Milošević. Advocating in favour of human rights and European democratic values and principles, Kučan, his party and Slovenia faced increasingly severe political confrontations with Belgrade and Serbia. On 23 January 1990, Kučan and the Slovenian delegation left the Party Congress. This was one of the factors that eventually led to the collapse of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, one of the pillars of the political system of the Socialist Yugoslavia.

==Political career==
Slovenia was the first of the federal units of Yugoslavia to introduce multi-party democracy and the first multi-party elections were held in April 1990. Kučan was elected president of the presidency, then a collective body, in 1990, in a ballot against the DEMOS candidate Jože Pučnik.

Kučan strongly opposed the preservation of Yugoslavia through violent means. After the concept of a loose confederation had failed to gain support by the republics of Yugoslavia, Kučan favoured a controlled process of non-violent disassociation that would enable the collaboration of the former Yugoslav nations on a new, different basis.

Slovenia declared its independence on 25 June 1991. In his speech on the occasion, Kučan ended with the words: &quot;Today dreams are allowed, tomorrow is a new day.&quot; On 26 June, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army embarked on troop movements that later escalated into the Ten-Day War. As the peace talks began at Brioni, with the European Community as a mediator, the army started its withdrawal from Slovenia. Kučan represented Slovenia at the peace conference on former Yugoslavia in The Hague and Brussels which concluded that the former Yugoslav nations were free to determine their future as independent states. On 22 May 1992 Kučan represented Slovenia as it became a new member of the United Nations.

After the independence and the international recognition of Slovenia, Kučan was elected as the first President of Slovenia in 1992 with the support of the citizens list. He won another five-year term in 1997–2002, running again as an independent and again winning the majority in the first round. His presidency ended in December 2002. He was succeeded as president by Janez Drnovšek. In March 2003 Slovenia held two referendums on joining the European Union and NATO. Milan Kučan took an active part in campaigning for these memberships, in order for Slovenia to achieve the goals it had set upon its independence. In May 2004, Slovenia became a full member of both the EU and NATO.

Since November 2004, Kučan has been a member of the Club of Madrid, an association of former democratic statesmen that works to strengthen democratic governance. He chairs the International Collegium together with Michel Rocard, former French Prime Minister. Since 2004 he is the chairman of Forum 21, a Slovene left-wing think-tank reflecting on issues of relevance for the future development of Slovenia and its position in a global society.

Kučan is also a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a not-for-profit organization established in 2008 to monitor tolerance in Europe and make recommendations on fighting xenophobia and intolerance on the continent.

==Personal life==
Kučan married Štefka Kučan in 1964. The couple have two daughters: Ana, a landscape architect and professor at the University of Ljubljana, and Špela, an anthropologist and ethnologist. In 1991, Kučan stated it is the duty of every Slovene to climb Mount Triglav.

<text>The New York City Marathon, currently branded as the TCS New York City Marathon for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon () that courses through the five boroughs of New York City. It is the largest marathon in the world, with 53,627 finishers in 2019 and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. Along with the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors.

The race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities.

==History==


The first New York City Marathon was held on September 13, 1970, organized by Fred Lebow and the then president of New York Road Runners, Vincent Chiappetta, with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.

Over the years, the marathon grew larger and larger. To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, Ted Corbitt proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.

Dick Traum became the first person to complete a marathon with a prosthetic leg when he finished the 1976 New York City Marathon. The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women&#x27;s world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times. An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000 and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field.

Beginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon&#x27;s first; the latest date in the marathon season was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979 when the race day of October 21 reached 80 °F (27 °C). The coldest race was in 1995 when the race day of November 12 only reached 43 °F (6 °C), with an intense wind chill.

The New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two-million spectators line the course. Before 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC and on Universal Sports for the entire country; however, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. Since 2022, the marathon has also been aired in Spanish via ESPN Deportes. The Marathon can also be watched online.

== Course ==

=== Initial course ===

The race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon. The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park. As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course:
The final measurements of the original New York City Marathon course, Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park, were done the evening of September 8, 1970, after work and training day, using the Calibrated Bicycle Method of Measuring. The course consisted of a start-up, out and back loop of 0.79 mile, from W. 67th St. and Central Park West, near the Tavern-on-the-Green Restaurant, up to the 72nd St. and the West Drive intersection and return to the Tavern-on-the Green followed by a loop of 1.695 miles; then four 5.935 mile loops, totaling 26.225 miles (11 yards over distance), ending at the Tavern-on-the Green Restaurant.

=== Five borough course ===
From 1976, the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island, in Fort Wadsworth, near the approach to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge typically carries only vehicular traffic and is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the bridge&#x27;s upper level and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event.

After descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn, mostly along Fourth Avenue and Bedford Avenue, for approximately the next . Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford–Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint.

At , runners cross the Pulaski Bridge, marking the halfway point of the race and the entrance into Long Island City in Queens. After about , runners exit Queens and cross the East River via the lower level of the Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge into Manhattan. At this point in the race, many runners begin to tire, as climbing the bridge is considered one of the most challenging points in the marathon.

Reaching Manhattan after about , the race proceeds north on First Avenue, then crosses into The Bronx via the Willis Avenue Bridge. The race is only in The Bronx for one mile before returning to Manhattan as the course follows East 138th St. before crossing the Madison Avenue Bridge. It then proceeds south through Harlem down Fifth Avenue and into Central Park at East 90th St. At the southern end of the park, the race proceeds west along 59th St./Central Park South, where thousands of spectators cheer runners on during the last mile. At Columbus Circle, the race reenters the park and finishes beside Tavern on the Green. The time limit for this course is hours from the 10:10 a.m. start.

=== Corrals and timing ===

In 2008, the race initiated a wave start. Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner&#x27;s bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as &quot;net time&quot; (as opposed to &quot;gun time&quot;).

Runners also pass timing mats at 5 km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5 km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20 km, 30 km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.

=== Different initial routes ===

Although there are three different routes taken through Bay Ridge and up Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, all the routes eventually merge at Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn at Mile 8, and the distance covered by the runners are the same. A runner&#x27;s bib will have a color (pink, orange, or blue) showing the initial route that they are assigned to, with each color having its own start village and corrals in the staging area.

==Past marathons==
=== 1970s ===

====1970====
On September 13, 1970, Gary Muhrcke won the first New York City Marathon held in Central Park in 2:31:38. 127 runners started the race and 55 finished. Nina Kuscsik, the sole woman entrant in the race, dropped out at 15 miles due to illness.

====1972====
Nina Kuscsik, Pat Barrett, Lynn Blackstone, Liz Franceschini, Cathy Miller, and Jane Muhrke protested the rule of the Amateur Athletic Union that women marathoners had to start their race ten minutes before or after the men, which as implemented by the New York City Marathon in 1972 meant that women had to start running ten minutes before the men. The women protested by sitting down and waiting ten minutes while holding signs protesting the rule, before starting to run when the men started; they became known as the NYC Six due to their protest. Ten minutes were added to their times. Kuscsik won the marathon. The ten minutes&#x27; difference requirement was dropped later in 1972.

====1974====
On September 29, 1974, Norbert Sander and Kathrine Switzer became the only New York City residents to win the New York City Marathon, Sander winning in 2:26:30 and Switzer the women&#x27;s division in 3:07:29. Future four-time NYC Marathon champion Bill Rodgers placed fifth in 2:36:00 out of 259 finishers (250 men, 9 women).

====1976====
After being run in Central Park from 1970 to 1975, this edition of the marathon traversed all five boroughs for the first time. There were 2,090 entrants and 1,549 finishers. Bill Rodgers, who finished 40th in the 1976 Olympic Games marathon in 2:25:14, came back to win the NYC Marathon in a course record 2:10:10. He beat 1976 Olympic marathon silver medalist Frank Shorter who finished second by more than three minutes, Shorter clocking 2:13:12. 41-year-old Miki Gorman was the first woman in 2:39:11, also a course record.

====1977====
Bill Rodgers and Miki Gorman were the top male and female finishers, as they had been the previous year, Rodgers winning in 2:11:28 and Gorman in 2:43:10.

====1978====
Bill Rodgers won his third consecutive New York City Marathon in 2:12:12 on a warm day. Grete Waitz, the Norwegian long-distance runner, set a new course record for women at 2:32:30 to win the first of a record nine New York Marathons. The New York Road Runners club annually sponsors &quot;Grete&#x27;s Great Gallop,&quot; a 10 kilometer race around the Central Park loop, in her honor.

====1979====

For the first time in NYC Marathon history, over 10,000 runners (10,477) completed the race. Bill Rodgers won his fourth and last New York City Marathon on another warm day in 2:11:42, overtaking Kirk Pfeffer who led for the first miles of the race. Grete Waitz again won the women&#x27;s race with a finish time of 2:27:33, becoming the first woman ever to break 2:30. In a normally trivial mistake, Rosie Ruiz was accidentally given a finish time of 2:56:29. This qualified her for the 1980 Boston Marathon, where she crossed the finish line with a record time of 2:31:56. It was quickly determined that she had not run the entire course in either race, igniting a major scandal. New York Marathon chief Fred Lebow rescinded Ruiz&#x27;s time after determining she had not finished the 1979 race, and officials in Boston quickly followed suit.

=== 1980s ===

====1980====
Alberto Salazar, an NCAA cross-country champion, won the 1980 New York City Marathon in 2:09:41. At the time this was the fastest marathon debut by an American. His performance was also a course record. He defended his title in 1981 and 1982. Grete Waitz won her third straight NYC Marathon in 2:25:42, also setting the course record in the women&#x27;s division.

====1981====

Alberto Salazar&#x27;s 2:08:13 was initially considered to be a world&#x27;s best in the marathon, but the mark was later rescinded by The Athletics Congress (now known as USA Track &amp; Field) when the course was measured to be short by approximately . Salazar remarked in 1985 that he would continue to believe that he ran a full marathon, since the lack of crowd control forced him to run wide during his turns. He has also suggested that a change in how courses were measured after the 1981 race contributed to the discrepancy in the course length.

====1983====

England&#x27;s Geoff Smith held a lead through the last half of the race, but was caught at the 26 mile mark in Central Park by 1972 Olympic 1500 metres bronze medalist Rod Dixon from New Zealand, who won by 9 seconds. Dixon had been two and a half minutes behind with 10 km to go. Dixon stood at the finish line celebrating with a collapsed and defeated Smith on the ground behind him.

====1984====
Orlando Pizzolato won on a hot day, stopping six times due to heat cramps, but still winning by over a minute in 2:14:53. This was the slowest winning time since 1976 when the New York City Marathon became a world class event. Grete Waitz won her sixth marathon in 2:29:30.

====1985====
Orlando Pizzolato and Grete Waitz both repeated their previous year&#x27;s victories. Pizzolato won in easier fashion than in 1984, in 2:11:34. Waitz took her seventh win in 2:28:06.

====1986====
This year&#x27;s marathon was held in November (November 2) for the first time and has been ever since. Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row that the men&#x27;s winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06.

====1987====
Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so. Priscilla Welch of Great Britain won in 2:30:17, while eight-time champion Grete Waitz did not compete.

====1988====
Steve Jones of the United Kingdom won, the first British man to do so, in 2:08:20. Grete Waitz won her ninth and last NYC Marathon in 2:28:07.

=== 1990s ===

====1990====
Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya won this year&#x27;s event in 2:12:39, the second-slowest time since 1976 when the marathon became a world class event. Wanda Panfil of Poland was the top woman in 2:30:45. She is the only woman to date from Poland to win this event. Grete Waitz, attempting to win her 10th NYC Marathon, finished fourth in 2:34:34 and then retired from competitive distance running.

====1992====

Grete Waitz completed her last New York Marathon with her friend and race co-founder, Fred Lebow, in celebration of Lebow&#x27;s 60th birthday. Lebow had been diagnosed with brain cancer and died two years later in 1994. They both completed the race with a time of 5:32:35. Waitz also died of cancer in 2011.
The men&#x27;s winner of this year&#x27;s marathon was Willie Mtolo of South Africa in 2:09:29. Lisa Ondieki of Australia was the women&#x27;s winner in 2:24:40, a course record that would last for nine years.

====1994====

During the 1994 event, Germán Silva recovered from a wrong turn seven-tenths of a mile before the finish that put him temporarily in second place 40 yards behind Benjamín Paredes. He ran a 5:15 final mile, including the detour, to beat Paredes and win the event by two seconds with a time of 2:11:21. The incident earned him the nickname &quot;Wrong Way Silva&quot;

====1995====
To date, this event was the coldest NYC Marathon ever (1979 was the warmest, topping out at 80 degrees). The temperature at race time was 40 degrees and only went up a few degrees as the race progressed. Wind gusts between 30 and 45 mph produced a wind chill factor in the upper 20s. Both male and female winners repeated their 1994 victories. Germán Silva of Mexico was victorious in 2:11:00. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya won the women&#x27;s race in 2:28:06. Loroupe had become the first woman from Africa to win the NYC Marathon the previous year.

====1997====
The total number of finishers exceeded 30,000 (30,427) for the first time. John Kagwe of Kenya won the men&#x27;s race in 2:08:12, while Franziska Rochat-Moser from Switzerland was the first woman in 2:28:43.

=== 2000s ===

====2000====
The 2000 NYC Marathon included the wheelchair division for men and women for the first time. Prize money was added in 2001. Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco won the men&#x27;s race in 2:10:09, becoming the first Moroccan man to take the title. Lyudmila Petrova of Russia was the first place woman in 2:25:45, the first woman from Russia to win the event.

====2001====
The 2001 NYC Marathon took place on November 4, less than two months after the September 11 attacks. Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia set a new course record of 2:07:43, a mark that stood until Geoffrey Mutai broke it in 2011. On the women&#x27;s side, Margaret Okayo of Kenya won, setting a new course record of 2:24:21. She would set another new record two years later that still stands.

====2002====
The nation of Kenya swept the top three spots in the men&#x27;s elite race in this year&#x27;s marathon, the first time in Marathon history that this has occurred. Rodgers Rop won in 2:08:07, while fellow Kenyan Christopher Cheboiboch finished 10 seconds behind in 2:08:17. &quot;Laban Kipkemboi&quot; of Kenya took third place in 2:08:39. On the women&#x27;s side, Joyce Chepchumba, also of Kenya, won the women&#x27;s elite race in 2:25:56. Lyubov Denisova of Russia placed second in 2:26:17 and Esther Kiplagat of Kenya was third in 2:27:00. This was also the first time that Kenyans won both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s race in marathon history.

====2003====

A record 34,729 people participated in the race. The top male finisher was Martin Lel of Kenya in a time of 2:10:30. The top female finisher was Margaret Okayo of Kenya in time of 2:22:31, breaking her previous course record of 2:24:21 set in 2001. In recent years, runners from Kenya have dominated the event. The top Americans were Matt Downin (2:18:48) and Sylvia Mosqueda (2:33:10), both from California. Rapper P.Diddy also ran for charity and raised $2,000,000 for the New York City Education system.

====2004====

The top female finisher was Britain&#x27;s Paula Radcliffe in a time of 2:23:10, beating Kenya&#x27;s Susan Chepkemei by 4 seconds, the closest finish up to that time. The men&#x27;s winner was Hendrik Ramaala of South Africa with a time of 2:09:28. The top Americans were Meb Keflezighi (2nd, 2:09:53) from California and Jenny Crain (15th, 2:41:06), from Wisconsin.

====2005====

In the closest finish in New York City Marathon history, Paul Tergat of Kenya barely outsprinted Hendrick Ramaala of South Africa in the final meters of the race for a time of 2:09:30, beating Ramaala by one second. In the women&#x27;s race, Jeļena Prokopčuka of Latvia won in a time of 2:24:41. Top amongst the Americans were Meb Keflezighi of California (2:09:56) and Jen Rhines of California (2:37:07). South African Ernst van Dyk took the wheelchair race in 1:31:11.

The 2005 event was administered by new NYRR CEO Mary Wittenberg, the first woman director of an international Major marathon.

====2006====

The top male finisher was Marílson Gomes dos Santos of Brazil in a time of 2:09:58, while Jeļena Prokopčuka of Latvia won the female marathon for the second consecutive time in 2:25:05. Gomes dos Santos became the first South American ever to win the race. Stephen Kiogora of Kenya placed second, and Paul Tergat, the 2005 defending champion and former marathon world record holder, placed third.

Former American professional road racing cyclist and triathlete Lance Armstrong ran in the 2006 race, finishing 868th with a time of 2:59:36. He also ran the same year in the British 10K. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee also completed the race in 2006, finishing in 5:33:43, and wearing bib #110, signifying the 110 pounds lost during his weight loss campaign.

Amanda McGrory won the female wheelchair race in a time of 1:54:17, while the male wheelchair division was won by Kurt Fearnley in a time of 1:29:22.

====2007====

The 2007 race was held on Sunday, November 4. It was the final race of the 2006–2007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men&#x27;s Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.

Martin Lel from Kenya won the men&#x27;s race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women&#x27;s winner was the world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win.

====2008====

The 2008 New York City Marathon was held on Sunday, November 2. A field of 37,899 runners participated. The men&#x27;s winner was Marílson Gomes dos Santos in 2:08:43. Paula Radcliffe won her third NYC marathon in 2:23:56.

The 2008 marathon events saw the deaths of three marathon participants. Carlos Jose Gomes, 58, of Brazil fell unconscious shortly after completing the race in 4:12:15. An autopsy revealed that he had a preexisting heart condition and died of a heart attack. Joseph Marotta, 66, of Staten Island, N.Y. succumbed to a heart attack hours after he completed his fourth New York City Marathon. He walked the course in 9:16:46. Fred Costa, 41, from Cincinnati, OH collapsed at the marathon and died on November 15 of a heart attack.

====2009====

The 2009 New York City Marathon was held Sunday November 1, 2009. Meb Keflezighi of the United States won the men&#x27;s race (the first American winner since Alberto Salazar in 1982) with a time of 2:09:15 while Ethiopian Derartu Tulu took the women&#x27;s crown in 2:28:52, the first Ethiopian woman to do so. This was the first marathon in history with more than 40,000 official finishers, as 43,660 crossed the finish, 5,053 more than the previous best at the 2008 edition of this race.

=== 2010s ===

====2010====

The 2010 New York City Marathon was held on November 7. Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia, in his first ever marathon, won the race after breaking away from his last rival, Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya, in the 25th mile to finish in a time of 2:08:14. The race featured 37-year-old world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who ran with a bad knee and dropped out of the race at the 16th mile. Afterwards, he announced his retirement, but later reversed this decision. Edna Kiplagat won the women&#x27;s title with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, ahead of American Shalane Flanagan.

The total number of official finishers, 44,829 (28,757 men and 16,072 women) was a new world record for a marathon race.

====2011====

The 2011 Marathon was held on November 6. The men&#x27;s event was won by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in a time of 2:05:06, breaking the 10-year-old course record. Second-place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively. Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women&#x27;s race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory. Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19. There were a world record 46,795 official finishers: 29,867 men and 16,928 women.

Edison Peña, one of the miners who had been trapped in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident, ran the race. Former NHL player, Mark Messier, finished with a time of 4:14:21 at age 50. Retired Dutch soccer player Edwin van der Sar ran in 4:19 and said it was the toughest thing he had ever done. Former CART champion Alex Zanardi won the handcycle class.

==== 2012 ====

The 2012 marathon was scheduled for November 4, 2012. Organizers planned to hold the event despite the passage of Hurricane Sandy the week before. However, on November 2, 2012, the marathon was cancelled; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that: &quot;While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division... We would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it.&quot; Three days earlier, Bloomberg had said that the marathon would take place. That declaration started a debate on whether to hold the race with thousands of residents still without electricity, public transportation, and other basic needs. Proponents for going ahead said that the event would give an economic and morale boost to the city, while opponents said the resources (such as food, water, and police) were better used elsewhere.

Some of the entrants ended up helping with cleanup efforts. 
Others chose to congregate and run an informal &quot;Shadow Marathon&quot; in Central Park. Controversy over the cancellation of the Marathon, the timing of the announcement and the repercussions of the decision, including criticism of New York Road Runners CEO Mary Wittenberg, continued well after the 2012 race was meant to have taken place. As a resolution, all who were registered to run the 2012 race were offered three options: a refund; guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the New York City Marathon in 2013, 2014, or 2015; or guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the NYC Half 2013.

====2013====

The 2013 New York City Marathon was run November 3, 2013. The race proved to be the clincher for the 2013 World Marathon Majors titles for both men and women. Duplicating their London Marathon wins from April 2013, Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo each won $500,000 for their season-wide efforts. After the 2012 cancellation, Geoffrey Mutai returned to become the first repeat winner in 15 years (after John Kagwe in 1997–1998). Under windy conditions, his 2:08:24 was more than 3 minutes slower than in 2011. Mutai broke away around mile 22 to win by almost a minute over Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede, who had finished third two years earlier. Jeptoo spotted Buzunesh Deba, an Ethiopian runner who has lived in the Bronx since 2009, three and a half minutes at the half-marathon mark, but came back to pass her in the 24th mile.

====2014====

The 2014 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 2, 2014. It was announced on October 2, 2013, that the marathon&#x27;s main sponsor would be Tata Consultancy Services starting in 2014. It is an eight-year deal, and the race was renamed the TCS New York City Marathon. Wind was unusually high, blowing from the north on a mostly northbound course.

On the women&#x27;s side, the winner was Shalane Flanagan, a native of Marblehead, Massachusetts. She was the first American to win since 1977. Her time was 2:26:53. Mary Keitany placed 2nd with 2:27:54, and Mamitu Daska finished 3rd with a time of 2:28:08.

==== 2018 ====

Their times of 2:05:59, 2:06:01 and 2:06:26 were the second, third and fourth fastest times in race history.

Mary Keitany was in a pack of women that passed halfway in 1:15:50 but then she ran the second 13.1 miles in 1:06:58, the fastest time ever for any second half of a marathon, to capture her fourth NYC crown in 2:22:48, the second fastest time ever there. London winner, Vivian Cheruiyot was second in 2:26:02 and American Shalane Flanagan placed third in 2:26:22, 31 seconds faster than her winning time the previous year.

<text>The year 1835 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy==
* August 5 – First sighting of the return of Comet Halley by Father Dominique Dumouchel, director of the Collegio Romano at the Vatican. It is next seen on August 21 by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve at the Dorpat Observatory. John Herschel had been expected to find the comet first, as he was at the time in South Africa with his 20 ft focal length reflector – at this time the world&#x27;s largest telescope. He finally observes it in October and watches until it reaches perihelion November 16. It reappears in January 1836, and Herschel will be the last person to observe it in May.
* August 25 – The first of six articles on discoveries of living creatures on the Moon supposedly made by Herschel and a fictitious companion named Dr. Andrew Grant is published in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. This incident is now known as the Great Moon Hoax.
* Berlin Observatory opened.
* Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville become the first women members of the Royal Astronomical Society.

==Biology==
* January – J. C. Loudon begins publication of &quot;Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum&quot;.
* Cell division is first observed under the microscope by German botanist Hugo von Mohl as he works over green algae &quot;Cladophora glomerata&quot;.

==Chemistry==
* Vinyl chloride first produced by Justus von Liebig and his student Henri Victor Regnault.

==Geology==
* Ordnance Geological Survey founded in Britain, under Henry De la Beche, the world&#x27;s first national geological survey.
* Roderick Murchison names the Silurian period, and Adam Sedgwick the Cambrian.

==Mathematics==
* Adolphe Quetelet publishes &quot;Sur l&#x27;homme et le développement de ses facultés, ou Essai de physique sociale&quot; (translated as &quot;Treatise on Man&quot;), outlining his theory of &quot;social physics&quot; and describing his concept of the &quot;average man&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;homme moyen&quot;) who is characterized by the mean values of measured variables that follow a normal distribution.

==Physics==
* George Biddell Airy provides the first full explanation of the Airy disk phenomenon.
* Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis examines motion on a spinning surface and deduces the Coriolis effect.
* William Rowan Hamilton states Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion.

==Physiology and medicine==
* Irish physician Robert James Graves first describes symptoms of Graves&#x27; disease.
* French physician Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis publishes his book &quot;Recherches sur les effets de la saignée dans quelques maladies inflammatoires et sur l&#x27;action de l&#x27;émétique et des vésicatoires dans la pneumonie&quot; in Paris, in which he analyzes case studies to demonstrate that bloodletting is largely ineffective as a treatment.
* Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet publishes his books &quot;Sur l&#x27;homme et le développement de ses facultés, ou Essai de physique sociale&quot;, in which he presents his theory of human variance around the average, with human traits being distributed according to a normal curve.

==Technology==
* August – H. Fox Talbot exposes the world&#x27;s first known photographic negatives at Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire, England.
* September 12 – A Prussian patent is granted to Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht and Carl Moritz for a valved bass tuba.
* Samuel Colt invents the revolver.
* Joseph Henry invents the electric relay.
* Samuel Morse develops the Morse code.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: William Snow Harris
* Wollaston Medal: Gideon Mantell

==Births==
* March 12 – Simon Newcomb (died 1909), Canadian mathematician and astronomer.
* March 14 – Giovanni Schiaparelli (died 1910), Italian astronomer.
* March 24 – Joseph Stefan (died 1893), Austro-Slovene physicist and mathematician.
* March 29 – Gustav Zander (died 1920), Swedish physician.
* August 2 – Elisha Gray (died 1901), American electrical engineer.
* October 1 – Ádám Politzer (died 1920), Hungarian otologist.
* November 6 – Cesare Lombroso (died 1909), Italian forensic psychiatrist.

==Deaths==
* August 18 – Friedrich Stromeyer (born 1776), German chemist.
* September 14 – John Brinkley (born 1763), British astronomer.
* September 23 – Antide Janvier (born 1751), French precision clockmaker.
* November 21 – Hanaoka Seishū (born 1760), Japanese surgeon.

<doc id="429902" wikidata="Q3416955" url="?curid=429902" title="Offshore radio">
<text>Offshore radio is radio broadcasting from ships or fixed maritime structures. Offshore broadcasters are usually unlicensed but transmissions are legal in international waters. This is in contrast to unlicensed broadcasting on land or within a nation&#x27;s territorial waters, which is usually unlawful.

==History==

The claimed first wireless broadcast of music and speech for the purpose of entertainment was transmitted from a Royal Navy craft, HMS &quot;Andromeda&quot;, in 1907. The broadcast was organized by a Lieutenant Quentin Crauford using the callsign QFP while the ship was anchored off Chatham in the Thames Estuary, England.

However, the majority of offshore broadcasters have been unlicensed stations using seaborne broadcasting as a means to circumvent national broadcasting regulations, for example the practice has been used by broadcasting organizations like the Voice of America as a means of circumventing national broadcasting regulations of other nations. Unlicensed offshore commercial stations have operated off the coasts of Belgium, Denmark, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, The United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and the United States.

By the late 1920s, the &quot;UK government concluded that radio was such a powerful means of mass communication that it would have to be in state control&quot;, and gave the publicly funded BBC a monopoly on broadcasting. Because of rigid governmental controls and programming mostly consisting of serious music and highbrow issues, much of the UK population began to turn to radio stations from abroad, such as Radio Lyon, Radio Normandy, Radio Athlone, Radio Mediterranee and Radio Luxembourg, especially on Sundays, when the BBC did not carry any entertainment programmes. However, English-speaking broadcast hours were limited and parts of the UK were unable to receive most stations properly during the daytime.

The earliest attempt to establish an offshore broadcaster in England occurred in 1928, when Associated Newspapers (owners of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;) acquired the yacht Ceto and installed radio equipment. Unfortunately, the apparatus could not operate properly on board, the signal being heavily affected by the climate conditions. The transmitter was then replaced by Siemens loudspeakers and the Ceto toured England &quot;broadcasting&quot; gramophone records interspersed by advertising.

Unauthorized offshore broadcasting stations operating from ships or fixed platforms in the coastal waters of the North Sea first appeared in 1958. There were as many as eleven such stations in the mid-1960s.

One of the most popular offshore radio broadcasts in Europe came from Radio Caroline, which developed out of both the strict broadcasting regulations in England in the 1960s as well as the fact the major labels had left little to no airtime to less established acts. The Radio Caroline name was used to broadcast from international waters, using five different ships of three different owners, from 1964 to 1990. Radio Caroline was the brainchild of Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, who dreamed up a way to air music by &quot;unestablished&quot; rock and roll artists Other well-known stations of the period were Radio Atlanta, Radio London, Radio 270 (broadcasting of the coast of Filey, Yorkshire) Radio 390, Radio Scotland, Radio Northsea International and Radio City.

Most offshore broadcast is usually associated with European unlicensed radio stations; the trend never caught on as much in the United States as most organizations that could afford an offshore broadcasting boat would instead buy a legal station. Still, there were a few American offshore stations that made a lasting impression. The first station to broadcast in the U.S. from international waters was RXKR off of the coast of California. and broadcast from May 1933 until August 1933. It was operated from a cargo carrier named the S.S. City of Panama, a ship that was actually supposed to be advertising tourism in Panama to Americans from California. The operators of the ship actually broadcast popular music and advertisements, fooling the Panamanian government and eventually being shut down at the request of the U.S. Department of State.

==Suppression==

Unlicensed &quot;Radio and TV Noordzee&quot; since August 1964 used REM island offshore platform for broadcasting aimed at the Netherlands. On December 12, 1964, a law, which split the North Sea into continental sections was passed in the Netherlands. The sea bed under REM Island, to which the structure was attached, was declared Dutch territory. Five days later, Dutch Marines boarded the platform and ended the broadcasting.

The Council of Europe in 1965 passed the &quot;European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts transmitted from Stations outside National Territories&quot; to address this loophole, although some member states were slow to implement this in national law. Radio broadcasts from ships that are unauthorized under the laws of the recipient may cause radio frequencies to be unusable. This can be potentially detrimental to certain emergency and security services. The 1965 agreement was an attempt to resolve this by treaty.

In 1967, the UK Government enacted the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, outlawing advertising on or supplying an unlicensed offshore radio station from the UK. Several other European countries passed similar legislation.

<doc id="429907" wikidata="Q703296" url="?curid=429907" title="Henry III, Duke of Brabant">
<text>Henry III of Brabant ( 1230 – February 28, 1261, Leuven) was Duke of Brabant between 1248 and his death. He was the son of Henry II of Brabant and Marie of Hohenstaufen. He was also a trouvère.

The disputed territory of Lothier, the former Duchy of Lower Lorraine, was assigned to him by the King Alfonso X of Castile, a claimant to the German throne. Alfonso also appointed him imperial vicar to advance his claims on the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1251, he married Adelaide of Burgundy ( 1233 – October 23, 1273), daughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy and Yolande de Dreux, by whom he had four children:
# Henry IV, Duke of Brabant ( 1251 – aft. 1272) Mentally disabled, and made to abdicate in favor of his brother John on 24 May 1267.
# John I, Duke of Brabant (1253–1294) Married first to Marguerite of France, daughter of King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and his wife Margaret of Provence, and later to Margaret of Flanders, daughter of Guy, Count of Flanders and his first wife Mathilda of Béthune.
# Godfrey of Brabant, Lord of Aarschot (d. July 11, 1302, Kortrijk), killed at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, married 1277 Jeanne Isabeau de Vierzon (d. aft. 1296)
# Maria of Brabant (1256, Leuven – January 12, 1322, Murel), married at Vincennes on August 27, 1274 to King Philip III of France.

On February 26, 1261, Henry III signed his will, which included a clause threatening to banish Jewish people from Brabant unless they ceased the practice of usury, albeit only after his death. He died two days later. His wife Adelaide, acting as regent since Henry IV was incapable of ruling, never enforced this policy laid out in the will, and the Jews were able to stay.

<doc id="429909" wikidata="Q863590" url="?curid=429909" title="Internet culture">
<text>Internet culture is a culture developed and maintained among frequent and active users of the Internet (also known as netizens) who primarily communicate with one another as members of online communities; that is, a culture whose influence is &quot;mediated by computer screens&quot; and information communication technology, specifically the Internet.

Internet culture arises from the frequent interactions between members within various online communities and the use of these communities for communication, entertainment, business, and recreation.

Studied aspects of Internet culture include anonymity/pseudonymity, social media, gaming and specific communities, such as fandoms, and has also raised questions about online identity and Internet privacy.

Increasingly widespread Internet adoption has influenced Internet culture; frequently provoking enforcing norms via shaming, censuring and censorship while pressuring other cultural expressions underground.

== History ==

The cultural history of the Internet is a story of rapid change. The Internet developed in parallel with rapid and sustained technological advances in computing and data communication. Widespread access to the Internet emerged as the cost of infrastructure dropped by several orders of magnitude with consecutive technological improvements.

Though Internet culture originated during the creation and development of early online communities – such as those found on bulletin board systems before the Internet reached mainstream adoption in developed countries – many cultural elements have roots in other previously existing offline cultures and subcultures which predate the Internet. Specifically, Internet culture includes many elements of telegraphy culture (especially amateur radio culture), gaming culture and hacker culture.

Initially, digital culture tilted toward the Anglosphere. As a consequence of computer technology&#x27;s early reliance on textual coding systems that were mainly adapted to the English language, Anglophone societies—followed by other societies with languages based on Latin script—enjoyed privileged access to digital culture. However, other languages have gradually increased in prominence. In specific, the proportion of content on the Internet that is in English has dropped from roughly 80% in the 1990s to around 52.9% in 2018.

As technology advances, Internet Culture continues to change. The introduction of smartphones and tablet computers and the growing computer network infrastructure around the world have increased the number of Internet users and have likewise resulted in the proliferation and expansion of online communities. While Internet culture continues to evolve among active and frequent Internet users, it remains distinct from other previously offline cultures and subcultures which now have a presence online, even those cultures and subcultures from which Internet Culture borrows many elements.

One cultural antecedent of Internet culture was amateur radio (commonly known as ham radio). By connecting over great distances, ham operators were able to form a distinct cultural community with a strong technocratic foundation, as the radio gear involved was finicky and prone to failure. The area that later became Silicon Valley, where much of modern Internet technology originates, had been an early locus of radio engineering. Alongside the original mandate for robustness and resiliency, the renegade spirit of the early ham radio community later infused the cultural value of decentralization and near-total rejection of regulation and political control that characterized the Internet&#x27;s original growth era, with strong undercurrents of the Wild West spirit of the American frontier.

At its inception in the early 1970s as part of ARPANET, digital networks were small, institutional, arcane, and slow, which confined the majority of use to the exchange of textual information, such as interpersonal messages and source code. Access to these networks was largely limited to a technological elite based at a small number of prestigious universities; the original American network connected one computer in Utah with three in California.

Text on these digital networks usually encoded in the ASCII character set, which was minimalistic even for established English typography, barely suited to other European languages sharing a Latin script (but with an additional requirement to support accented characters), and entirely unsuitable to any language not based on a Latin script, such as Mandarin, Arabic, or Hindi.

Interactive use was discouraged except for high value activities. Hence a store and forward architecture was employed for many message systems, functioning more like a post office than modern instant messaging; however, by the standards of postal mail, the system (when it worked) was stunningly fast and cheap. Among the heaviest users were those actively involved in advancing the technology, most of whom implicitly shared much the same base of arcane knowledge, effectively forming a technological priesthood.

The origins of social media predate the Internet proper. The first bulletin board system was created in 1978, GEnie was created by General Electric in 1985, the mailing list Listserv appeared in 1986, and Internet Relay Chat was created in 1988. The first official social media site, SixDegrees launched in 1997.

In the 1980s, the network grew to encompass most universities and many corporations, especially those involved with technology, including heavy but segregated participation within the American military–industrial complex. Use of interactivity grew, and the user base became less dominated by programmers, computer scientists and hawkish industrialists, but it remained largely an academic culture centered around institutions of higher learning. It was observed that each September, with an intake of new students, standards of productive discourse would plummet until the established user base brought the influx up to speed on cultural etiquette.

Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia, opening the door for public participation. Soon the network was no longer dominated by academic culture, and the term eternal September, initially referring to September 1993, was coined as Internet slang for the endless intake of cultural newbies.

Commercial use became established alongside academic and professional use, beginning with a sharp rise in unsolicited commercial e-mail commonly called spam. Around this same time, the network transitioned to support the burgeoning World Wide Web. Multimedia formats such as audio, graphics, and video become commonplace and began to displace plain text, but multimedia remained painfully slow for dial-up users. Also around this time the Internet also began to internationalize, supporting most of the world&#x27;s major languages, but support for many languages remained patchy and incomplete into the 2010s.

On the arrival of broadband access, file sharing services grew rapidly, especially of digital audio (with a prevalence of bootlegged commercial music) with the arrival of Napster in 1999 and similar projects which effectively catered to music enthusiasts, especially teenagers and young adults, soon becoming established as a prototype for rapid evolution into modern social media. Alongside ongoing challenges to traditional norms of intellectual property, business models of many of the largest Internet corporations evolved into what Shoshana Zuboff terms surveillance capitalism. Not only is social media a novel form of social culture, but also a novel form of economic culture where sharing is frictionless, but personal privacy has become a scarce good.
In 1998, there was Hampster Dance, the first successful Internet meme.

== Identity – &quot;architectures of credibility&quot; ==
One early study, conducted from 1998 to 1999, found that the participants view information obtained online as slightly more credible than information from magazines, radio, and television, information obtained from newspapers was the most credible. Credibility online is established in much the same way that it is established in the offline world. Lawrence Lessig claimed that the architecture of a given online community may be the most important factor in establishing credibility. Factors include: anonymity, connection to physical identity, comment rating system, feedback type (positive vs positive/negative), moderation. 

=== Anonymity ===

Many sites allow anonymous commentary, where the user-id attached to the comment is something like &quot;guest&quot;. In an architecture that allows anonymous commentary, credibility attaches only to the object of the comment. Sites that require some link to an identity may require only a nickname that is sufficient to allow comment readers to rate the commenter, either explicitly, or by informal reputation.

=== Connection to physical identity ===
Architectures can require that physical identity be associated with commentary, as in Lessig&#x27;s example of Counsel Connect. However, to require linkage to a physical identity, sensitive information about a user must be collected and safeguards for that collected information must be established – users must place sufficient trust in the site. Irrespective of safeguards, as with Counsel Connect, use of physical identities links credibility across the frames of the Internet and real space, influencing the behaviors of those who contribute in those spaces. However, even purely online identities can establish credibility. Even though nothing inherently links a person or group to their Internet-based persona, credibility can be earned, because of the time required.

=== Comment rating system ===
In some architectures, commenters can, in turn, be rated by other users, potentially encouraging more responsible commentary, although the profusion of popular shitposters belies this. 

=== Feedback type ===
Architectures can be oriented around positive feedback or allow both positive and negative feedback. While a particular user may be able to equate fewer stars with a &quot;negative&quot; rating, the semantic difference is potentially important. The ability to actively downrate an identify may violate laws or norms.

=== Moderation ===
Architectures can give editorial control to a group or individual not employed by the site (e.g., Reddit), termed moderators. Moderation may take be either proactive (previewing contents) or reactive (punishing violators). 

The moderator&#x27;s credibility can be damaged by overly aggressive behavior.

<text>Charles Bishop Kuralt (September 10, 1934 – July 4, 1997) was an American television, newspaper and radio journalist and author. He is most widely known for his long career with CBS, first for his &quot;On the Road&quot; segments on &quot;The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot;, and later as the first anchor of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, a position he held for fifteen years. In 1996, Kuralt was inducted into Television Hall of Fame of the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.

Kuralt&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; segments were recognized twice with personal Peabody Awards. The first, awarded in 1968, cited those segments as heartwarming and &quot;nostalgic vignettes.&quot; In 1975, his award was for his work as a U.S. &quot;bicentennial historian&quot;; his work &quot;capture[d] the individuality of the people, the dynamic growth inherent in the area, and...the rich heritage of this great nation.&quot; Kuralt also won an Emmy Award for &quot;On the Road&quot; in 1978. He shared in a third Peabody awarded to &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; in 1979.

==Early life ==
Kuralt was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. His father, Wallace H. Kuralt Sr. was a social worker and his mother, Ina Bishop, was a teacher. In 1945, the family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where his father became Director of Public Welfare in Mecklenburg County. Their house off Sharon Road, then 10 miles south of the city, was the only structure in the area.

As a boy, he won a children&#x27;s sports writing contest for a local newspaper by writing about a dog that got loose on the field during a baseball game. When he was 14 years old, Kuralt became one of the youngest radio announcers in the country, covering minor-league baseball games and hosting a music show. In 1948, he was named one of four National Voice of Democracy winners at age 14, where he won a $500 scholarship. Later, at Charlotte&#x27;s Central High School, Kuralt was voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; in his graduating class of 1951.

He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, he joined the literary fraternity St. Anthony Hall. He also became editor of &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot; and worked for WUNC radio. He also had a starring role in a radio program called &quot;American Adventure: A Study of Man in The New World&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Hearth Fire&quot;, which aired on August 4, 1955. It is a telling of the advent of TVA&#x27;s building lakes written by John Ehle and directed by John Clayton. During the summer, he also worked at WBTV in Charlotte. He graduated from UNC in 1955 with a degree in history.

== Career ==
After graduating from UNC, Kuralt worked as a reporter for the &quot;Charlotte News.&quot; He wrote &quot;Charles Kuralt&#x27;s People,&quot; a column that won an Ernie Pyle Award in 1956. He moved to CBS in 1957 as a writer. When he was 25 years old, he became the youngest correspondent in the history of CBS News. He became the first host of the primetime series &quot;Eyewitness to History&quot; in 1960. He also covered the 1960 presidential election. &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;Kuralt&#x27;s a comer. Young, good looking, full of poise and command, deep voiced and yet relaxed and not over-dramatic, he imparts a sense of authority and reliability to his task.&quot;

In 1961, he became CBS&#x27;s Chief Latin American Correspondent, covering 23 countries from a base in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1963, he became the Chief West Coast Correspondent, moving to Los Angeles. The next year, he returned to New York City and the CBS News headquarters. Starting in 1961, he did four tours in Vietnam during the war. Kuralt said, &quot;&quot;Every time I got sent to Vietnam I seemed to get into some terrible situation without really trying too hard. In 1961, we got the first combat footage of that stage of the war. It was before the U.S. was involved with troops in the field, but we went out with the Vietnamese Rangers and got ambushed. Half the company we were with got killed. We were lucky as hell not to get killed &quot;

He also covered the revolution in the Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). In 1967, Kuralt and a CBS camera crew spent eight weeks with Ralph Plaisted in his first attempt to reach the North Pole by snowmobile, which resulted in the documentary &quot;To the Top of the World&quot; and his book of the same name.

Kuralt was said to have tired of what he considered the excessive rivalry between reporters on the hard news beats. He said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the competitiveness or the deadline pressure,&quot; he told the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, upon his induction into their Hall of Fame. &quot;I was sure that Dick Valeriani of NBC was sneaking around behind my back—and of course, he was!—getting stories that would make me look bad the next day. Even though I covered news for a long time, I was always hoping I could get back to something like my little column on the &quot;Charlotte News&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;On the Road&quot; ===
Tired of covering war stories, Kuralt proposed to his bosses a new project: &quot;How about no assignments at all? How about three months of rolling down the Great American Highway, just to see what he could see?&quot; When he finally persuaded CBS to let him try out the idea for three months with a three-person crew. It turned into a quarter-century project, with Kuralt logging more than a million miles. &quot;On the Road&quot; became a regular feature on &quot;The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot; in 1967 and ran through 1980. 

Kuralt hit the road in a motor home (he wore out six before he was through) with a small crew and avoided the interstates in favor of the nation&#x27;s back roads in search of America&#x27;s people and their doings. He said, &quot;Interstate highways allow you to drive coast to coast, without seeing anything&quot;.

According to Thomas Steinbeck, the older son of John Steinbeck, the inspiration for &quot;On the Road&quot; was Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; (whose title was initially considered as the name of Kuralt&#x27;s feature). During his career, he won three Peabody Awards and ten Emmy Awards for journalism. He also won a George Polk Awards in 1980 for National Television Reporting.

In 2011, Kuralt&#x27;s format was revived by CBS News, with Steve Hartman taking Kuralt&#x27;s space. , Hartman continues to host the segment weekly on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

=== &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; anchor and subsequent CBS roles ===
On January 28, 1979, CBS launched &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; with Kuralt as host. On October 27, 1980, he was added as host of the weekday broadcasts of CBS&#x27; &quot;Morning&quot; show as well, joined with Diane Sawyer as weekday co-host on September 28, 1981. Kuralt left the weekday broadcasts in March 1982, but continued to anchor &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. In 1989, he covered the democracy movement in China. From 1990 to 1991, he was an anchor on &quot;America Tonight&quot;. On April 3, 1994, he retired after 15 years as a host of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, and was replaced by Charles Osgood.

=== After CBS ===
At age 60, Kuralt surprised many by retiring from CBS News. At the time, he was the longest tenured on-air personality in the News Division. However, he hinted that his retirement might not be complete. In 1995, he narrated the TLC documentary &quot;The Revolutionary War&quot;. In early 1997, he signed on to host a syndicated, thrice-weekly, ninety-second broadcast, &quot;An American Moment&quot;, presenting what CNN called &quot;slices of Americana&quot;. He agreed to host a CBS cable broadcast show, &quot;I Remember&quot;, designed as a weekly, hour-long review of significant news from the three previous decades.

==Personal life==
On August 25, 1954, Kuralt married Jean Sory Guthery of Charlotte, North Carolina. At the time, both Kuralt and Sory were seniors at UNC. They had two daughters, Susan Bowers and Lisa Bowers White. The marriage ended in divorce in 1960. He married Suzanne Baird in 1962. They lived in New York City.

Kuralt refused to alter his habits in favor of healthier ones; he ate unhealthy food, drank and smoked. He was once pulled over for driving under the influence. Late in his life, Kuralt became ill with systemic lupus erythematosus. Kuralt died from heart failure on July 4, 1997, at New York–Presbyterian Hospital, aged 62. Kuralt was buried on the UNC grounds in Old Chapel Hill Cemetery. His wife Suzanne died in 1999 and is buried next to him.

After Kuralt&#x27;s death, questions about his estate led to the public disclosure of his three-decade companionship with a Montana woman named Patricia Shannon (formerly Patricia Shannon Baker). Kuralt met Shannon while doing a story on Pat Baker Park in Reno, Nevada, which Shannon had promoted and volunteered to build in 1968. The park was in a low-income area of Reno that had no parks until Shannon promoted her plan. Kuralt mentioned Shannon and the building of the park — but not the nature of their relationship — in a book he published in 1990 chronicling his early life and journalistic career. With Shannon, Kuralt had a second, &quot;shadow&quot; family; he paid for Shannon to attend the Inchbald School of Design, and helped to raise and financially support her three children. Kuralt&#x27;s wife was apparently unaware of this. After Kuralt&#x27;s death, Shannon asserted that he had willed her a property in Twin Bridges, Montana; though it was contested by Kuralt&#x27;s family, her claim was upheld by the Montana Supreme Court.

<text>Ronald Arthur Biggs (8 August 1929 – 18 December 2013) was an English criminal who helped plan and carry out the Great Train Robbery of 1963. He subsequently became notorious for his escape from prison in 1965, living as a fugitive for 36 years, and for his various publicity stunts while in exile. In 2001, Biggs returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. He was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009 and died in a nursing home in December 2013.

==Early life==
Biggs was born in Stockwell, London, on 8 August 1929. As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Delabole, Cornwall.

==Career==
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He was dishonourably discharged for desertion two years later after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, Biggs took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker&#x27;s office in Lambeth, London. During his incarceration in HM Prison Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.

After his third prison sentence, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage, the daughter of a primary school headmaster. They had three sons together.

==Great Train Robbery==

In 1963, Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family, happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as &quot;Stan Agate&quot;, or because of his age, &quot;Old Pete&quot; or &quot;Pop&quot;. The train driver&#x27;s real name is unknown, since he was never caught. Biggs introduced the driver to the train robbery plot, which involved Reynolds. Biggs was given the job of arranging for Agate to move the Royal Mail train after it had been waylaid.

On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire. The gang then stopped the mail train in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs&#x27;s 34th birthday. Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region. Therefore, the driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point. Biggs&#x27;s main task had been to get Agate to move the train, and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.

When the men had unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds&#x27; allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million (equivalent to £ as of 2025); Biggs&#x27;s share was £147,000 (equivalent to £ as of 2025). With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.

After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there, Biggs&#x27;s fingerprints were found on a tomato sauce bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang. In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.

==Escape and abscondment==
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van. He fled to Brussels by boat before sending a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery. During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent. Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.

===Australia===
In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia. By the time Biggs and his family arrived in 1966, they had spent all but £7,000 (equivalent to £ as of 2025) of his £147,000 (equivalent to £ as of 2025) share of the train robbery proceeds: £40,000 (equivalent to £ as of 2025) on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 (equivalent to £ as of 2025) paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; and the rest on legal fees and expenses.

In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne, where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. Biggs had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the GTV Channel 9 Television City studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the evening news bulletin at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.

Following disclosure of Biggs&#x27; fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to a divorce in 1974, which was completed in 1976. Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 (equivalent to £ as of 2025) to an Australian media group to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs&#x27;s flight to Brazil. Charmian later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons—who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil—live anonymously. In 2012, Charmian was a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama &quot;Mrs Biggs&quot;, which recounts the couple&#x27;s time from first meeting to Biggs&#x27;s flight to Brazil.

===Rio de Janeiro===
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom. In 1971, Biggs&#x27;s eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash in Melbourne.

In 1974, &quot;Daily Express&quot; reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O&#x27;Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.

During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double bass player), Jaime Shields, and Aureo de Souza to record &quot;Mailbag Blues&quot;, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.

In April 1977, Biggs attended an informal drinks party on board the Royal Navy frigate , which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested. Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs&#x27;s status as a known criminal meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10 p.m. To provide an income, Biggs&#x27;s family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. &quot;We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, &#x27;How are Charlton Athletic doing?&#x27; It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley.&quot; Around this time, &quot;Ronnie Biggs&quot; mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.

Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, Julien Temple&#x27;s film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for &quot;No One is Innocent&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)&quot;/&quot;Cosh The Driver&quot;) and &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot; were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols&#x27; final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. &quot;No One is Innocent&quot; was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.
In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (a fact which chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth) and Biggs was sent back to Brazil. In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation. The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview, as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing. The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film &quot;Prisoner of Rio&quot; (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film, Biggs was played by Paul Freeman.

Biggs&#x27;s son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, was seven years old when he became a member of the highly successful Brazilian children&#x27;s programme and music band Balão Mágico (1982–1986), bringing relative financial security to his father.

In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs &quot;Police on My Back&quot; and &quot;Carnival in Rio&quot; by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album &quot;Bajo Otra Bandera&quot; by Argentinian punk band Pilsen. 

In 1993, Slipper travelled once more to Rio on a private mission to try to persuade Biggs to come home voluntarily, which failed. In 1994 the German journalist Ulli Kulke managed to bring both Biggs and Slipper together in a telephone interview. In this interview the two antagonists talk about their encounters in 1974 and 1993. The Interview was first published (in German) in 1994 in the German weekly &quot;Wochenpost&quot; and reprinted in the daily newspaper Die Welt in 2013 on the occasion of Biggs&#x27; death. 

In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs&#x27;s extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition. English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.

==Return to the United Kingdom==
In 2001 Biggs announced to &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.

===Imprisonment===
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.

His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was not available in Brazil, and he had friends who would have contributed to such expenses, but that it was his desire to &quot;walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter&quot;. John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: &quot;I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father&#x27;s death. Biggs should serve his punishment.&quot; Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.

On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London, in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly, and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days. The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client&#x27;s death was likely to be imminent. On 26 October 2005, Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal, stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live. Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have &quot;difficulty&quot; speaking.

On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds. In December, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released to die with his family: &quot;I am an old man, and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it, and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time, and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil, I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted.&quot;

In January 2009 a series of strokes were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk. His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July. On 13 February that year, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia. This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable. News of his condition prompted fresh calls from his son Michael for his release on compassionate grounds.

On 23 April 2009, the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July, having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July, Straw did not accept the Parole Board&#x27;s recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was &#x27;wholly unrepentant&#x27;. On 28 July, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier, with a chest infection and a fractured hip, but returned to prison on 17 July. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: &quot;It&#x27;s the worst he&#x27;s ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there.&quot;

On 30 July, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given &quot;permission&quot; to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that &quot;an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich&quot; had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service. Biggs was released from custody on 6 August 2009, two days before his 80th birthday, on &quot;compassionate grounds&quot;.

===Later life===
Following his release from prison, Biggs&#x27;s health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home. In response to claims that Biggs&#x27;s state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, &quot;This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill.&quot; However, Biggs himself stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas [of 2010], that would be fantastic.&quot;

On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet Hospital. His son Michael stated, &quot;he&#x27;s conscious but he&#x27;s in a lot of pain&quot;. In August 2010, it was claimed by the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.

On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened. On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, &quot;Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw&quot;, at Shoreditch House, London. He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.

On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, &quot;Mrs Biggs&quot;, to be based around the life of Biggs&#x27;s wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for &quot;Mrs Biggs&quot;.

In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds. In July 2013, &quot;The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary: 1963–2013&quot; was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.

===Death===
On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, North London, where he was being cared for. His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon. Biggs&#x27;s body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium. The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs&#x27;s funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged&quot;.

<doc id="429917" wikidata="Q542500" url="?curid=429917" title="Angora rabbit">
<text>The Angora rabbit (), one of the most ancient groups of domestic rabbit breeds, which is bred for the long fibers of its coat, known as &quot;Angora wool.&quot; They are gathered by shearing, combing or plucking. Because rabbits do not possess the same allergy-causing qualities as many other animals, their wool is an important alternative. There are at least 11 distinct breeds of Angora rabbit, four of which are currently recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA): the English Angora, the French Angora, the Giant Angora and the Satin Angora. Other unrecognized breeds include the German Angora, the Finnish Angora, the Chinese Angora, the Japanese Angora, the Korean Angora, the Russian Angora, the St Lucian Angora and the Swiss Angora.

==History==
The Angora is said to have originated in Ankara (historically known as &quot;Angora)&quot;, in present-day Turkey, and is known to have been brought to France in 1723. The Angora rabbit became a popular pet of the French royalty in the mid-18th century, and Angoras had spread to other parts of Europe by the end of that century. In the United States, garments made of Angora-rabbit wool have been popular ever since they first arrived in the early 20th century. However, only during World War II did domestic production expand to meet the demand for more than a year. This valuable, soft, silky, fiber aroused much interest, and quickly people became enamored with the production process.

==Angora-rabbit wool==


Angoras are bred mainly for their wool, which is silky and soft. At only 14–16 micrometres in diameter, it is similar to cashmere in fineness and softness to the touch. A healthy adult Angora&#x27;s wool will grow approximately per month. Regular grooming is necessary to prevent the fibre from matting and felting on the rabbit, which causes discomfort and can lead to pain and even infection. Angora wool is harvested (plucked or shorn) every three to four months throughout the year. The coat needs to be monitored after 6 months of regrowth since it may tend to &quot;die&quot; and easily mat.

Angora wool may be gathered periodically by hand-plucking the hair within the coat that are being naturally shed. Full harvesting is done by shearing the coat with clippers or small scissors, often while the rabbit sits atop a groomer&#x27;s turntable. Shearing typically starts at the head, moving across the shoulders to the tail. The rabbit is then flipped and the underside is shorn from tail to chin. Between of wool may be harvested from a Giant Angora.

==Health==
===Wool block===

Because of the length and abundance of their hair, Angora rabbits are particularly susceptible to &quot;wool block&quot;, a potentially lethal blockage of the digestive tract. All rabbits ingest some of their wool when they groom themselves, but their digestive system is sometimes not able to pass that foreign matter. The length of Angora hair compounds the risk of impaction, which can lead to death. Clipping or plucking an Angora&#x27;s wool every 90–120 days is necessary to prevent wool block.

===Wool mites===

&quot;Cheyletiella parasitovorax&quot; is a skin parasite commonly found in Angora rabbits. Signs of infestation are flaky skin patches and fur loss. Wool mites reduce fiber yields and the resulting skin flakes are detrimental to the fiber quality. Wool mites may be treated with ivermectin or with carbaryl powder.

==Angora rabbit breeds==

The iconic long coat of the Angora is the result of a rabbit gene referred to as l (i.e., lowercase &quot;L&quot;). This &quot;Angora gene&quot; is present in all Angora breeds. It has also sometimes been utilized in the development of other rabbit breeds or other breeds&#x27; new varieties. &quot;Dwarf Wooly&quot; breeds including American Fuzzy Lop, Lionhead and Jersey Wooly are now recognized in the U.S. by ARBA. Belgium and France have their own Dwarf Wooly breeds. There is also a rare Mini English Angora breed in New Zealand.

===English Angora===

*Weight: 
*ARBA-recognized varieties: Agouti, Broken, Pointed White, Ruby-eyed White, Self, and Shaded

Before 1939 there was one breed of &quot;Angora Wooler&quot;. In 1939 ARBA reclassified &#x27;Angora Wooler&#x27; as English Type and French Type. In 1944 ARBA officially separated Angora rabbits into two breeds: English Angora and French Angora.

Rabbits of the English Angora breed are adorned with &quot;fur&quot;, growths of wool on the ears and the entire face except above the nose, and front feet, along with their thick body, and wool. They are gentle in nature, but they are not recommended for those who do not groom their animals. Their wool is very dense and needs to be groomed twice a week.

This is the smallest Angora rabbit of the four ARBA-recognized breeds. This breed is more common as a pet because of the facial features that give it a puppy or teddy-bear look. If the texture of the wool is correct, the maintenance is relatively easy; if the texture of the rabbit is cottony, it requires a great deal of maintenance. Beginning spinners may find the wool challenging.

The English Angora can be bred to have broken colors—i.e., white with black spots—but this is not accepted by ARBA standards and would lead to a disqualification when showing the rabbit. When an English Angora rabbit is shown, the toenails should also be only one color, the ears could be folded over at the tips and the furnishings on the face may cover their eyes. The English Angora is the only one of the Angora breeds that has hair covering its eyes.

===French Angora===
*Weight: 
*ARBA-recognized varieties: Agouti, Broken, Pointed White, Self, Shaded, Ticked, and Wide Band
This breed has a dense undercoat. If the texture is correct it requires less maintenance than other Angora breeds. Small ear tufts are allowed but not usually preferred by breeders. ARBA recognizes the same colors as with English Angora, plus ticked and wide band. They are shown at ARBA shows using the types &#x27;white&#x27; and &#x27;colored&#x27; (broken being a colored). As with other ARBA-shown rabbits, toenails should also be only one color.

The French Angora is one of the large Angora breeds at , with a commercial body type. It differs from the English, Giant and German Angora in that it possesses a clean (hairless) face and front feet with only minor tufting on the rear legs. The color of a French Angora is determined by the color of its head, feet and tail (all the same color). This variety of angora fibre has smooth silky texture. Beginning spinners may find Angora wool a challenge.
Desirable characteristics of the fibre include its texture, warmth, light weight and pure white color. It is used for sweaters, mittens, baby clothes and millinery.

Though common, the German Angora is not currently recognized by ARBA. The International Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders (IAGARB) maintains a breed standard for the German Angora.

===Giant Angora===

*Weight: Minimum 
*ARBA-recognized varieties: Ruby-eyed White

The Giant Angora is the largest of the ARBA-recognized Angora breeds. It was originally developed to be an efficient commercial producer that could be sustained on 16–18% protein pellets plus hay, and live in the standard sized, all-wire cages.

Because ARBA wouldn&#x27;t allow German Angoras to be shown, their body type being considered too similar to other Angora breeds, Louise Walsh of Taunton, Massachusetts, created a new breed. She used German Angoras, French Lops and Flemish Giants to develop a completely different &#x27;commercial&#x27; body type. ARBA officially recognized the Giant Angora in 1988. Its coat includes three types of wool: soft underwool, awn fluff and awn hair.

The awn-type wool exists only in the Giant and German Angora breeds. The Giant Angora has furnishings on the face and ears. Many people confuse the German with the Giant Angora, but it is their body type that differs.

The only color variety ARBA currently recognizes for the Giant Angora is the Ruby-eyed White (REW), a color that indicates the genetic absence of pigment (&quot;albino&quot;). The Giant Angora produces more wool than the French, Satin or English Angoras. The Giant Angora is the only 6-class animal in the Angora breed. It should have a commercial-type body with a very dense coat of wool. The head should be oval in appearance, that is broad across the forehead and slightly narrower at the muzzle. The Giant Angora should have forehead tufts (head trimmings) and cheek furnishings. The head trimmings should be noticeable, but does have lighter trimmings than bucks. The ears should be lightly fringed and well tasseled. The Giant Angora is also the only breed of angora that is shown only as a ruby-eyed white. A Black color variety of the Giant Angora is in development but has not been sanctioned by ARBA.

The Giant Angora coat contains three fiber types for its texture. The underwool should be the most dominant over the other two types of hair. It should be medium-fine, soft and delicately waved and have a gentle shine. Beginning spinners may find Angora wool a challenge.

The Awn Fluff has a guard hair tip and is a stronger, wavy wool. The Awn Fluff is found between the underwool and Awn Hair. The Awn Hair, also known as guard hair, is the third type of fiber. The Awn Hair is a strong straight hair that protrudes above the wool and must be present and evident.

The classification of the Giant Angora is different from the other three breeds owing to it being a 6-class animal. The junior buck and junior doe must be under 6 months of age and have a minimum weight of . The intermediate buck and intermediate doe are 6–8 months of age. The senior buck and senior doe are 8 months of age or over. The senior buck must weigh at least . The senior doe must weigh at least .

When Giant Angoras are judged the majority of the points are based on the wool, which includes density, texture and length. The points for &#x27;general type&#x27; include the body type, head, ears, eyes, feet, legs and tail.

Like many other &#x27;giant&#x27; breeds of rabbit, the Giant Angora grows slowly. A doe usually takes more than a year to reach maturity (size and weight). A buck can take up to 1.5 years to mature (size and weight).

===Satin Angora===

The Satin Angora was developed in the late 1970s by Mrs. Meyer of Holland Landing, Ontario, Canada, who crossed French Angoras with rabbits of the Satin breed. In addition to the sheen (for which the Satin is known), true red and copper pigments emerged in the new rabbits. In all &#x27;satinized&#x27; coats, the hair shaft has a semi-transparent outer shell that reflects light, resulting in deep color, high luster and an extremely soft and silky texture to the hair.

The Satin Angora (like the French Angora) has no furnishings on the face, ears or feet. The Satin does not produce as much wool as other Angora breeds, but this trait is being improved upon through selective breeding. While more difficult to keep groomed than the Giant or French Angora, the Satin is less difficult than the English Angora. Because of the soft texture of the wool and the lower guard-hair count in the coat, matting occurs more readily. Daily combing is therefore recommended.

Satin Angora wool is said to be stronger for spinning than other Angora varieties, but because of its slipperiness it can be more difficult to spin.

*Japanese Angora
*Russian Angora
*St. Lucian Angora
*Swiss Angora
*Dutch Angora


== Genetics ==
Some genes or rather mutations causing the Angora phenotype have been identified. A gene that has been repeatedly found to be affected in Angora rabbits is the FGF5 gene. For example, a specific mutation (T19234C) changes the amino acid threonine (T) to cysteine (C) in the Fgf5 protein, causing the phenotype.

<doc id="429918" wikidata="Q170046" url="?curid=429918" title="Ja'far al-Sadiq">
<text>Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq (; –765 CE) was a Muslim hadith transmitter and the last agreed-upon Shia Imam between the Twelvers and Isma&#x27;ilis. Known by the title al-Sadiq (&quot;The Truthful&quot;), Ja&#x27;far was the eponymous founder of the Ja&#x27;fari school of Islamic jurisprudence. In the canonical Twelver hadith collections, more traditions are cited from Ja&#x27;far than that of the other Imams combined, although their attribution to him is questionable, making it hard to determine his actual teachings. Among the theological contributions ascribed to him are the doctrine of &quot;&quot; (divinely inspired designation of each Imam by the previous Imam) and &quot;&quot; (the infallibility of the Imams), as well as that of  (religious dissimulation under persecution).

Al-Sadiq is also revered by Sunni Muslims as a reliable transmitter of hadith, and a teacher to the Sunni scholars Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas, the namesakes of the Hanafi and Maliki schools of jurisprudence. Al-Sadiq also figures prominently in the initiatic chains of many Sufi orders. A wide range of religious and scientific works were attributed to him, though no works penned by al-Sadiq remain extant.

Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq was born around 700 CE, perhaps in 702. He was about thirty-seven when his father, Muḥammad al-Bāqir, died after designating him as the next Imam. As the sixth Shia Imam, al-Sadiq kept aloof from the political conflicts that embroiled the region, evading the requests for support that he received from rebels. He was the victim of some harassment by the Abbasid caliphs and was eventually, according to Shia sources, poisoned at the instigation of the caliph al-Mansur. The question of succession after al-Sadiq&#x27;s death divided the early Shīʿa community. Some considered the next Imam to be his eldest son, Isma&#x27;il al-Mubarak, who had predeceased his father. Others accepted the Imamate of his younger son and brother of Isma&#x27;il, Musa al-Kazim. The first group became known as the Isma&#x27;ili, whereas the second and larger group was named Jaʽfari or the Twelvers.

==Life==
===Birth and early life===
Ja&#x27;far ibn Muḥammad ibn Ali al-Sadiq was born in Medina around 700 CE, and 702 is given in most sources, according to Gleave. Ja&#x27;far was the eldest son of Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Bāqir, the fifth Shīʿīte Imam, who was a descendant of ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law, and Fāṭima, Muhammad&#x27;s daughter. Ja&#x27;far&#x27;s mother, Umm Farwa, was a great-granddaughter of the first &quot;rāshidūn&quot; caliph, Abū Bakr. During the first fourteen years of his life, Ja&#x27;far lived alongside his grandfather, Zayn al-Abidin, the fourth Shīʿīte Imam, and witnessed the latter&#x27;s withdrawal from politics and his limited efforts amid the popular appeal of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. Ja&#x27;far also noted the respect that the famous scholars of Medina held toward Zayn al-Abidin. In his mother&#x27;s house, Ja&#x27;far also interacted with his grandfather, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, a famous traditionalist of his time. The Umayyad rule reached its peak in this period, and the childhood of al-Sadiq coincided with the growing interest of Medinans in religious sciences and the interpretations of the Quran. With the death of Zayn al-Abidin, Ja&#x27;far entered his early manhood and participated in his father&#x27;s efforts as the representative of the Household of Muhammad (&quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;). Ja&#x27;far performed the  ritual with his father, al-Bāqir, and accompanied him when the latter was summoned to Damascus by the Umayyad caliph Hisham for questioning.

===Under the Umayyad rulers===
Most Umayyad rulers are often described by Muslim historians as corrupt, irreligious, and treacherous. The widespread political and social dissatisfaction with the Umayyad Caliphate was spearheaded by Muhammad&#x27;s extended family, who were seen by Muslims as God-inspired leaders in their religious struggle to establish justice over impiety. Al-Sadiq&#x27;s imamate extended over the latter half of the Umayyad Caliphate, which was marked by many (often Shia) revolts and eventually witnessed the violent overthrow of the Umayyads by the Abbasids, the descendants of Muhammad&#x27;s paternal uncle al-Abbas. Al-Sadiq maintained his father&#x27;s policy of quietism in this period and, in particular, was not involved in the uprising of his uncle, Zayd, who enjoyed the support of the Mu&#x27;tazilites and the traditionalists of Medina and Kufa. Al-Sadiq also played no role in the Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyads. His response to a request for help from Abu Muslim, the Khorasani rebel leader, was to burn his letter, saying, &quot;This man is not one of my men, this time is not mine.&quot; At the same time, al-Sadiq did not advance his claims to the caliphate, even though he saw himself as the divinely designated leader of the Islamic community (). This spiritual, rather than political, imamate of al-Sadiq was accompanied by his teaching of the  doctrine (religious dissimulation) to protect the Shia against prosecution by Sunni rulers. In this period, al-Sadiq taught quietly in Medina and developed his considerable reputation as a scholar, according to Momen.

===Under the Abbasid rulers===
The years of transition from the Umayyads to the Abbasids was a period of weak central authority, allowing al-Sadiq to teach freely. Some four thousand scholars are thus reported to have studied under al-Sadiq. Among these were Abu Ḥanifa and Malik ibn Anas, founders of the Hanafi and Maliki schools of law in Sunni Islam. Wasil ibn Ata, founder of the Mu&#x27;tazila school of thought, was also among his pupils. After their overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasids violently prosecuted their former Shia allies against the Umayyads. Because they had relied on the public sympathy for the Ahl al-Bayt to attain power, the Abbasids considered al-Sadiq a potential threat to their rule. As the leader of the politically quiet branch of the Shia, he was summoned by al-Mansur to Baghdad but was reportedly able to convince the caliph to let him stay in Medina by quoting the hadith, &quot;The man who goes away to make a living will achieve his purpose, but he who sticks to his family will prolong his life.&quot; Al-Sadiq remained passive in 762 CE to the failed uprising of his nephew, Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya. Nevertheless, he was arrested and interrogated by al-Mansur and held in Samarra, near Baghdad, before being allowed to return to Medina. His house was burned by order of al-Mansur, though he was unharmed, and there are reports of multiple arrests and attempts on his life by the caliph.

==Imamate==

Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq was about thirty-seven when his father, al-Bāqir, died after designating him as the next Shīʿīte Imam. He held the Imamate for at least twenty-eight years. His Imamate coincided with a crucial period in the history of Islam, as he witnessed both the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids in the mid-8th century (661–750 CE) and later the Abbasids&#x27; prosecution of their former Shīʿīte allies against the Umayyads. The leadership of the early Shīʿa community was also disputed among its different factions. In this period, the various Alid uprisings against the Umayyads and later the Abbasids gained considerable support among the Shia. Among the leaders of these movements were Zayd ibn Ali (al-Sadiq&#x27;s uncle), Yahya bin Zayd (al-Sadiq&#x27;s cousin), Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya and his brother (al-Sadiq&#x27;s nephews). These claimants saw the imamate and caliphate as inseparable for establishing the rule of justice, according to Jafri. In particular, Zayd argued that the imamate could belong to any descendant of Hasan or Husayn who is learned, pious, and revolts against the tyrants of his time. In contrast, similar to his father and his grandfather, al-Sadiq adopted a quiescent attitude and kept aloof from politics. He viewed the imamate and caliphate as separate institutions until such time that God would make the Imam victorious. This Imam, who must be a descendant of Muhammad through Ali and Fatima, derives his exclusive authority not from political claims but from  (divinely inspired designation by the previous Imam) and he also inherits the special knowledge () which qualifies him for the position. Al-Sadiq did not originate this theory of imamate, which was already adopted by his predecessors, Zayn al-Abidin and al-Baqir. Rather, al-Sadiq leveraged the sudden climate of political instability to freely propagate and elaborate the Shia teachings, including the theory of imamate. 

===Succession===
After the death of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, his following fractured, and the largest group, who came to be known as the Twelvers, followed his younger son, Musa al-Kadhim. It also appears that many expected the next Imam to be al-Sadiq&#x27;s eldest son, Isma&#x27;il, who predeceased his father. This group, which later formed the Isma&#x27;ili branch, either believed that Isma&#x27;il was still alive or instead accepted the imamate of Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s son, Muhammad. While the Twelvers and the Isma&#x27;ilis are the only extant Jaf&#x27;ari Shia sects today, there were more factions at the time: Some followers of al-Sadiq accepted the imamate of his eldest surviving son, Abdullah al-Aftah. Several influential followers of al-Sadiq are recorded to have first followed Abdullah and then changed their allegiance to Musa. As Abdullah later died childless, the majority of his followers returned to Musa. A minority of al-Sadiq&#x27;s followers joined his other son, Muhammad al-Dibaj, who led an unsuccessful uprising against Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun, after which he abdicated and publicly confessed his error. A final group believed that al-Sadiq was not dead and would return as Mahdi, the promised savior in Islam.

==Death==
Al-Sadiq died in 765 CE (148 AH) at sixty-four or sixty-five. His death in Shia sources is attributed to poisoning at the instigation of al-Mansur. According to Tabatabai, after being detained in Samarra, al-Sadiq was allowed to return to Medina, where he spent the rest of his life in hiding until he was poisoned by order of al-Mansur. He was buried in the al-Baqi Cemetery, being one of the 4 Imams to be buried in the cemetery (the other Imams being Hasan Ibn Ali,Ali Ibn Husayn and Muhammad Ibn Ali), in Medina, and his tomb was a place of pilgrimage until 1926. It was then that Wahhabis, under the leadership of Ibn Saud, the founding King of Saudi Arabia, conquered Medina for the second time and razed all the tombs except that of the Islamic prophet. According to Tabatabai, upon hearing the news of his death, al-Mansur ordered the governor of Medina to behead al-Sadiq&#x27;s heir, the future Imam. The governor, however, learned that al-Sadiq had chosen four people, rather than one, to administer his will: al-Mansur himself, the governor, the Imam&#x27;s oldest (surviving) son Abdullah al-Aftah, and Musa al-Kazim, his younger son. Al-Mansur&#x27;s plot was thus thwarted.

==Family==
Al-Sadiq married Fatima, a descendant of Hasan, with whom he had two sons, Isma&#x27;il (the sixth Isma&#x27;ili Imam) and Abdullah al-Aftah. He also married Hamida Khatun, a slave-girl from Berber or Andalusia, who bore al-Sadiq three more sons: Musa al-Kazim (the seventh Twelver Imam), Muhammad al-Dibaj, and Ishaq al-Mu&#x27;tamin. She was known as Hamida the Pure and respected for her religious learning. Al-Sadiq often referred other women to learn the tenets of Islam from her. He is reported to have praised her, &quot;Hamida is removed from every impurity like an ingot of pure gold.&quot; Ishaq al-Mu&#x27;tamin, is said to have married Sayyida Nafisa, a descendant of Hasan.
==Contributions==
After Ali, al-Sadiq is possibly the most famed religious scholar of the House of Muhammad, widely recognized as an authority in Islamic law, theology, hadith, and esoteric and occult sciences. Amir-Moezzi considers him possibly the most brilliant scholar of his time, and the variety of (at times contradictory) views ascribed to al-Sadiq suggest that he was an influential figure in the history of early Islamic thought, as nearly all the early intellectual factions of Islam (except perhaps the Kharijites) wished to incorporate al-Sadiq into their history in order to bolster their schools&#x27; positions. He is cited in a wide range of historical sources, including the works of al-Tabari, Ya&#x27;qubi, al-Masudi, and Ibn Khallikan. This popularity, however, has hampered the scholarly attempts to ascertain al-Sadiq&#x27;s actual views. A number of religious and scientific works also bear al-Sadiq&#x27;s name, though scholars generally regard them as inauthentic. It seems likely that he was a teacher who left writing to others. The most extensive contributions of al-Sadiq were to the Twelver Shia, helping establish them as a serious intellectual force in the late Umayyad and early Abbasid periods, according to Gleave. Tabatabai writes that the number of traditions left behind by al-Sadiq and his father, al-Baqir, were more than all the hadiths recorded from Muhammad and the other Shia Imams combined. Shia thought has continued to develop based on the teachings of the Shia Imams, including al-Sadiq. According to Rizvi, al-Sadiq preached against slavery. 

=== Doctrine of imamate ===
Following his predecessors, Zayn al-Abidin and al-Baqir, al-Sadiq further elaborated the Shia doctrine of imamate, which has become the hallmark of the Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili Shia theologies, but rejected by the Zaydis. In this doctrine, Imam is a descendant of Muhammad through Ali and Fatima who derives his exclusive authority not from political claims but from , that is, divinely-inspired designation by the previous Imam. As the successor of Muhammad, the Imam has an all-inclusive mandate for temporal and religious leadership of the Islamic community, though this doctrine views the imamate and caliphate as separate institutions until such time that God would make the Imam victorious. The Imam also inherits from his predecessor the special knowledge (), which qualifies him for the position. Similar to Muhammad, Imam is believed to be infallible thanks to this unique knowledge, which also establishes him as the sole authorized source for interpreting the revelation and guiding the Muslims along the right path. This line of Imams in Shia Islam is traced back to Ali, who succeeded Muhammad through a divine decree.

===Ja&#x27;fari school of law===
Law in Islam is an all-embracing body of ordinances that govern worship and ritual in addition to a proper legal system. Building on the work of his father, al-Sadiq is remembered as the eponymous founder of the Ja&#x27;fari school of law (), followed by the Twelver Shia. According to Lalani, the Isma&#x27;ili jurisprudence (), as codified by al-Qadi al-Numan, is also primarily based on the large corpus of statements left behind by al-Sadiq and his father, al-Baqir. Al-Sadiq denounced the contemporary use of opinion (), personal juristic reasoning (), and analogical reasoning () as human attempts to impose regularity and predictability onto the laws of God. He argued that God&#x27;s law is occasional and unpredictable and that Muslims should submit to the inscrutable will of God as revealed by the Imam. He also embraced a devolved system of legal authority: it is ascribed to al-Sadiq that, &quot;It is for us [the Imams] to set out foundational rules and principles (), and it is for you [the learned] to derive the specific legal rulings for actual cases.&quot; Similarly, when asked how legal disputes within the community should be solved, al-Sadiq described the state apparatus as evil () and encouraged the Shia to refer to &quot;those who relate our [i.e., the Imams&#x27;] hadiths&quot; because the Imams have &quot;made such a one a judge () over you.&quot; The Sunni jurisprudence is based on the three pillars of the Quran, the practices of Muhammad (), and consensus (), whereas the Twelver Shia jurisprudence adds to these pillars a fourth pillar of reasoning () during the occultation of Mahdi. In Shia Islam, also includes the practices of the Shia Imams.

=== Doctrine of &quot;taqiya&quot; ===
 is a form of religious dissimulation, where an individual can hide one&#x27;s beliefs under persecution. was introduced by al-Baqir and later advocated by al-Sadiq to protect his followers from prosecution at the time when al-Mansur, the Abbasid caliph, conducted a brutal campaign against the Alids and their supporters. This doctrine is based on verse 16:106 of the Quran, where the wrath of God is said to await the apostate &quot;except those who are compelled while their hearts are firm in faith.&quot; According to Amir-Moezzi, in the early sources, means &quot;the keeping or safeguarding of the secrets of the Imams&#x27; teaching,&quot; which may have resulted at times in contradictory traditions from the Imams. In such cases, if one of the contradictory reports matches the corresponding Sunni doctrine, it would be discarded because the Imam must have had agreed with Sunnis to avoid prosecution of himself or his community. Armstrong suggests that also kept conflict to a minimum with those religious scholars () who disagreed with the Shia teachings.

===Free will===
On the question of predestination and free will, which was under much discussion at the time, al-Sadiq followed his father, portraying human responsibility but preserving God&#x27;s autocracy, asserting that God decreed some things absolutely but left others to human agency. This compromise, widely adopted afterward, is highlighted when al-Sadiq was asked if God forces His servants to do evil or whether He had delegated power to them: he answered negatively to both questions and instead suggested, &quot;The blessings of your Lord are between these two.&quot; Al-Sadiq taught &quot;that God the Most High decreed some things for us and He has likewise decreed some things through our agency: what He has decreed for us or on our behalf He has concealed from us, but what He has decreed through our agency He has revealed to us. We are not concerned, therefore, so much with what He has decreed for us as we are with what He has decreed through our agency.&quot; Al-Sadiq is also credited with the statement that God does not &quot;order created beings to do something without providing for them a means of not doing it, though they do not do it or not do it without God&#x27;s permission.&quot; Al-Sadiq declared, &quot;Whoever claims that God has ordered evil, has lied about God. Whoever claims that both good and evil are attributed to him, has lied about God.&quot; In his prayers, he often said, &quot;There is no work of merit on my own behalf or on behalf of another, and in evil there is no excuse for me or for another.&quot;

===Quranic exegesis===
Al-Sadiq is attributed with what is regarded as the most important principle for judging traditions, that a hadith should be rejected if it contradicts the Quran, whatever other evidence might support it. In his books &quot;Haqaeq al-Tafsir&quot; and &quot;Ziadat Ḥaqaeq al-Tafsir&quot;, the author Abd-al-Raḥman Solami cites al-Ṣadiq as one of his major (if not the major) sources. It is said that al-Sadiq merged the inner and the outer meanings of the Quran to reach a new interpretation of it (). It is ascribed to al-Sadiq that, &quot;The Book of God [Quran] comprises four things: the statement set down (), the implied purport (), the hidden meanings, relating to the supra-sensible world (), and the exalted spiritual doctrines (). The literal statement is for the ordinary believers (). The implied purport is the concern of the elite (). The hidden meanings pertain to the Friends of God (). The exalted spiritual doctrines are the province of the prophets ().&quot; These remarks echo the statement of Ali, the first Shia Imam.

Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq&#x27;s significance in the formation of early Muslim thought is demonstrated by the fact that his name is used as a reference in Sufi, scientific, Sunni legal, Ismaili, and circles. Most of these groups desired to use his legacy for their own agendas. However, the Imami Shia tradition is the most comprehensive source for his teachings.
===Shia Islam===
While the Sunnis respect al-Sadiq as a transmitter of hadith and a jurist (), Shiites view him as an imam and therefore infallible, and record his sayings and actions in the works of hadith and jurisprudence (). In the Shia writings of the Imamiyya, his legal rulings constitute the most important source of Imamiyya law. In fact, the Imam&#x27;s legal doctrine is called Ja&#x27;fari jurisprudence () by both the Imamis and the Sunnis in order to refer to his legal authority. The Shias considered al-Sadiq the only legitimate person who could represent the Sharia in his time and have the authority to rule. According to Imami Shi&#x27;as, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, is the sixth imam who was responsible for turning the imamiya into a powerful intellectual movement during the late Umayyad and early Abbasid eras. Al-Sadiq is presented by Ya&#x27;qubi as one of the most respected personalities of his epoch, adding that it was customary to refer to al-Sadiq as &#x27;the learned one&#x27;.

===Sunni Islam ===
Al-Sadiq is respected in Sunni Islam as a jurist and a master teacher of hadith sciences, who is cited in several s (chains of transmissions). He was one of the Shiekhs (masters) of Imam Malik ibn Anas and he has narrated several narrations in Muwatta Imam Malik. He was also a teacher to Imam Sufyan al-Thawri. According to Jafri, the famous Sunni jurist Malik ibn Anas would quote al-Sadiq as, &quot;The truthful () Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad himself told me that…&quot; (A similar attitude is reported from Abu Hanifa.). The Sunni scholar al-Dhahabi recognizes al-Sadiq&#x27;s contribution to Sunni tradition, and al-Shahrastani, the influential Sunni historian, pays al-Sadiq a high tribute in his work. There are also many Sunni traditions in which al-Sadiq and other descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib deny any Shia affiliation. Sunnis also point to several Shia narrations in which al-Sadiq denies any affiliation with Shias and denies claiming to be the Imam. The Hadith Scholar Yahya ibn Ma&#x27;in said “If reliable transmitters transmit hadith from Ja’far Al-Sadiq, then his [Ja’far’s] hadith is steadfast; but if the likes of Ma’tab and Hammad b. ‘Isa transmit from him, then it is worthless.”

===Sufism===
Al-Sadiq holds a special prominence among Sufi orders: a number of early Sufi figures are associated with al-Sadiq; he is praised in the Sufi literature for his knowledge of  (), and numerous sayings and writings about spiritual progress are ascribed to him in Sufi circles. He is also viewed at the head of the Sufi line of saints and mystics by the Sufi writers Abu Nu&#x27;aym and Farid al-Din Attar. Attar praises al-Sadiq as the one &quot;who spoke more than the other imams concerning the ,&quot; who &quot;excelled in writing on innermost mysteries and truths and who was matchless in expounding the subtleties and secrets of revelation.&quot; However, some of the material attributed to al-Sadiq in the Sufi literature is said to be apocryphal. Among others, the Shia Moqaddas Ardabili has thus dismissed the alleged links between al-Sadiq and Sufism as an attempt to gain the authority of al-Sadiq for Sufi teachings. Gleave and Bowering suggest that &quot;Tafsir al-Quran&quot;, &quot;Manafe&#x27; Sowar al-Quran,&quot; and &quot;Kawass al-Qoran al-Azam,&quot; three mystical commentaries of the Quran attributed to al-Sadiq, were composed after his death because these works demonstrate a mastery of the recent lexicon of Muslim mysticism. Alternatively, Taylor is certain that the traditions in the Quranic exegesis edited by the mystic Dhu al-Nun Misri can be traced back to the Imam. Given the appeal and influence of al-Sadiq outside the circle of his Shia supporters, Algar suggests that he likely played some role in the formation of Sufism. Both Abu Nu&#x27;aym and Attar narrate several encounters between al-Sadiq and contemporary proto-Sufis to highlight his asceticism (). One encounter describes how Sofyan Ṯawri, the jurist and ascetic, allowed himself to reproach the Imam for his silken robe, only for the Imam to reveal beneath it a modest white woolen cloak, explaining that the finery was for men to behold and the woolen cloak for God. The Imam thus displayed the former and concealed the latter.

===Ghulat===
One of the distinctive features of the is the imam&#x27;s deification. One group of them, called the &quot;Mufawidda&quot;, preached that God gave Muhammad and the imams the authority to create and take care of all living things. Many Twelver Shi&#x27;i traditions state that al-Baqir and al-Sadiq did not have supernatural abilities and did not perform the miracles attributed to them. Despite these denials, a number of hadiths that contained concepts found their way into Twelver Shiite hadith collections.

According to some early Imami heresiographers, Abu al-Khattab (died 755) asserted that he had been chosen to serve as al-Sadiq&#x27;s envoy and had been given access to his hidden doctrines. It seems that Abu al-Khattab&#x27;s views on al-Sadiq&#x27;s divinity and his own status as a prophetic messenger of God eventually led al-Sadiq to repudiate him in 748. His adherents were referred to as Khattabiyya. Later Twelver tradition disavows any connection between al-Sadiq and the views of Abu al-Khattab.

The same Imami heresiographers also claim that al-Mufaddal ibn Umar al-Ju&#x27;fi (died before 799) and his followers, the &quot;Mufaddaliya&quot;, likewise regarded al-Sadiq as a god and themselves as his prophets. However, it is not certain whether the &quot;Mufaddaliya&quot; ever existed, and in Twelver hadith al-Mufaddal consistently appears as the intimate companion of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq and his son Musa al-Kazim, with the exception of the brief period of disgrace with Jaʿfar al-Sadiq due to his &quot;Khattabiyya&quot; leanings. According to Twelver traditions, al-Mufaddal was even appointed by al-Sadiq to control the excesses of &quot;Khattabiyya&quot;. Nevertheless, al-Mufaddal&#x27;s status as a close confidant of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq led to a large number of writings being attributed to him by later authors, including major works such as the &quot;Kitab al-Haft wa-l-azilla&quot; (&#x27;Book of the Seven and the Shadows&#x27;) and the &quot;Kitab al-Sirat&quot; (&#x27;Book of the Path&#x27;).

===Yarsanism===
In Yarsanism is Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq considered to be incarnation of an angel from the group &quot;Haft-sardar&quot; (The Seven Commanders). In the Yaresan book &quot;Doureh-ye Bahlul&quot; is written that Yaresan saint Bahlul Mahi visited Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq in Baghdad and studied there.

==Works==
A large number of religious books bear al-Sadiq&#x27;s name as their author, but none of them can be attributed to al-Sadiq with certainty. 
It has been suggested that al-Sadiq was a writer who left the work of writing to his students. In this regard, some of the works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan () also claim to be mere expositions of al-Sadiq&#x27;s teachings.
A Quran commentary (), a book on divination (Ketb al-jafr), numerous drafts of his will, and several collections of legal dicta are among the works attributed to al-Sadiq.
===Exegesis===
Most of the extant writings attributed to al-Sadiq are commentaries () on the Quran:
In Sufi circles, a number of mystical Quranic exegeses are attributed to al-Sadiq, such as &quot;Tafsir al-Quran&quot;, &quot;Manafe&#x27; Sowar al-Quran&quot;, and &quot;Kawass al-Quran al-Azam&quot;.

Another attributed work is the book of , a mystical commentary which according to Ibn Khaldun was written by al-Sadiq about the hidden () meanings of the Quran. According to Ibn Khaldun this book was transmitted from al-Sadiq and written down by Hārūn ibn Saʿīd al-ʿIjlī.

Perhaps the most influential mystical exegesis attributed to al-Sadiq is the , composed by Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī (d.330/942). This text was first introduced to modern scholarship by Louis Massignon, and was later published in a critical edition by Paul Nwyia. Another version was published by ʿAlī Zayʿūr. One of the outstanding features of this exegesis is its emphasis on letter mysticism. It is considered to be the oldest mystical commentary of the Quran after Sahl al-Tustari&#x27;s exegesis.

&quot;Tafsīr al-Nuʿmānī&quot; is another exegesis attributed to al-Sadiq, which he supposedly narrated on the authority of Ali from Muhammad. This treatise was compiled by Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Nu&#x27;mani - known as Ibn Abi Zainab. The 17th-century scholar Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi recorded it in his . A summary of it has also been attributed to the Twelver theologian Sharif al-Murtaza and was published under the title .

&quot;Tafsīr al-Imām al-Ṣādiq&quot; is another commentary attributed to al-Sadiq, which Agha Bozorg Tehrani mentions it in his book al-Dharī&#x27;a under the title &quot;Tafsir al-Imam Ja&#x27;far bin Muhammad al-Sadiq&quot; and it is believed that one of Sadiq&#x27;s students narrated it from him. Fuat Sezgin calls this work &quot;Tafsīr al-Qurʾān&quot;. A copy of it with the title &quot;Tafsīr al-Imām al-Ṣādiq&quot;, according to Bankipur Oriental Library&#x27;s catalogue, is written by al-Nuʿmānī based on the sayings of al-Sadiq. This commentary is arranged according to the Surahs of the Quran and covers only the words of the Quran that require explanation. This commentary, which is a type of mystical commentary, deals with both the exoteric (ẓāhir) and the esoteric (bāṭin) aspects of the Quran. It is mostly about God and his relationship with mankind, also man&#x27;s knowledge of God and the relationship between Muhammad and God.

===Tawhid al-Mufaddal===

The (&#x27;Declaration by al-Mufaddal of the Oneness of God&#x27;), also known as the (&#x27;Book on the Beginning of Creation and the Incitement to Contemplation&#x27;), is a ninth-century treatise concerned with proving the existence of God, attributed to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq&#x27;s financial agent al-Mufaddal ibn Umar al-Ju&#x27;fi (died before 799). The work presents itself as a dialogue between al-Mufaddal and Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, who is the main speaker.

Like most other works attributed to al-Mufaddal, the was in fact written by a later, anonymous author who took advantage of al-Mufaddal&#x27;s status as one of the closest confidants of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq in order to ascribe their own ideas to the illustrious Imam. However, it differs from other treatises attributed to al-Mufaddal by the absence of any content that is specifically Shi&#x27;i in nature, a trait it shares with only one other Mufaddal work—also dealing with a rational proof for the existence of God—the (&#x27;Book of the Myrobalan Fruit&#x27;). Though both preserved by the 17th-century Shi&#x27;i scholar Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi (died 1699), the only thing that connects the and the to Shi&#x27;ism more generally is their ascription to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq and al-Mufaddal. Rather than by Shi&#x27;i doctrine, their content appears to be influenced by Mu&#x27;tazilism, a rationalistic school of Islamic speculative theology ().

The is in fact a revised version of a work falsely attributed to the famous Mu&#x27;tazili litterateur al-Jahiz (died 868) under the title (&#x27;Book of Proofs and Contemplation on Creation and Administration&#x27;). Both the and pseudo-Jahiz&#x27;s likely go back on an earlier 9th-century text, which has sometimes been identified as the (&#x27;Book of Thought and Contemplation&#x27;) written by the 9th-century Nestorian Christian Jibril ibn Nuh ibn Abi Nuh al-Nasrani al-Anbari.

The teleological argument for the existence of God used in the is inspired by Syriac Christian literature (especially commentaries on the Hexameron), and ultimately goes back on Hellenistic models such as the pseudo-Aristotelian (&#x27;On the Universe&#x27;, 3rd/2nd century BCE) and Stoic theology as recorded in Cicero&#x27;s (106–43 BCE) .

===Other works===

&quot;Misbah al-Sharia and Miftah al-Haqiqah&quot; is another work attributed to al-Sadiq. It is on personal conduct, with chapters on various topics such as legal interests interspersed with general moral issues, and advice on how to lead a spiritual life and thus purify the soul.
As the first person who came across this book in the 7th century A.H., Sayyed Ibn Tawus described it as a collection of hadiths of Jafar al-Sadiq. It includes a prediction of future events and sufferings. There is a specific Shia chapter in &quot;Knowledge of the Imams&quot; in which the names of all the Imams (both before al-Sadiq and after him) are mentioned during the exchange of reports between Muhammad and Salman the Persian. Mohammad Baqer Majlesi considered this work to have been written by Shaqiq al-Balkhi, who supposedly quoted it from &quot;one of the people of knowledge,&quot; and not explicitly from Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. Despite Majlesi&#x27;s doubts about its authenticity, this work remains very popular as a manual of personal worship and has been the subject of a number of commentaries by prominent Shia and Sufi scholars. It has also been translated into different languages. Its manuscript is available in the library of Gotha.

There is also a book on dream interpretation that is attributed to al-Sadiq and is known by the name &quot;Taqsim al-roʾyā&quot;. It is identical to the work &quot;Ketāb al-taqsim fi taʿbir al-ḥolm&quot;, which is credited to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. Eighty various types of dream sightings, ranging from the religious (dreams of God, angels, prophets, and imams) to the profane (dreams of meat, fat, and cheese), are interpreted by Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq in this book. According to Robert Gleave, it is not always clear whether they can be regarded as works attributed to Jafar al-Sadiq or works attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib that is transmitted through Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. From a Shia perspective, this is not problematic because there is no discernible difference between the knowledge of one imam and that of another from a religious perspective.

The &quot;Kitāb al-Ihlīlaja&quot; is presented as al-Sadiq&#x27;s opinions transmitted through al-Mufaddal. The work is allegedly a response to al-Mufaddal&#x27;s request for a refutation of atheists.
Jafar al-Sadiq describes his own argument with an atheist Indian doctor in it. The discussion took place as the doctor prepared a myrobalan plant-based medication (known in Arabic as &quot;Ihlīlaj&quot;, and hence the title of the work).

==Shia disciples==
Momen contends that of the few thousand students who are said to have studied under al-Sadiq, only a few could have been Shia, considering that al-Sadiq did not openly advance his claims to the imamate. Notable Shia students of al-Sadiq included 

* Hisham ibn al-Hakam was a famous disciple of al-Sadiq, who proposed a number of doctrines that later became orthodox in the Twelver theology, including the rational necessity of the divinely-guided imam in every age to teach and lead God&#x27;s community.
* Aban ibn Taghlib was an outstanding jurist and traditionist and an associate of al-Sadiq in Kufa, but also of Zayn al-Abidin and al-Baqir. The latter is reported to have praised Aban, &quot;Sit in the mosque of Kufa and give legal judgment to the people. Indeed I would like to see among my Shia people like you.&quot;

* Burayd ibn Mu&#x27;awiya al-&#x27;Ijli in Kufa was a famous disciple of al-Baqir and later al-Sadiq, who later became a key authority in the Shia jurisprudence (). Al-Baqir praised him (along with Abu Basir Moradi, Muhammad bin Muslim, and Zurarah) as worthy of the paradise.
* Abu Basir al-Asadi was considered one of the poles of the intellectual leadership of the Imami community of Kufa. His name is included in the number of six companions of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq that hadiths narrated by any one of them is considered authentic by many Shi&#x27;a scholars. Some consider Abu Basir al-Moradi as one of those six people instead of Abu Basir al-Asadi.
* Abu Basir Moradi, a famous Shia jurist () and traditionist, was another associate of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq. Al-Sadiq is believed to have told Moradi, Zurarah, Burayd, and Muhammad ibn Muslim that the prophetic hadiths would have been lost without them.
* Abu Ja&#x27;far Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Nu&#x27;man known as Mu&#x27;min al-Taq was a distinguished theologist in Kufa and a devoted follower of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, whose debates about imamate are famous. &quot;Kitab al-Imamah&quot; and &quot;Kitab al_Radd alla al-Muazila fi Imamat al-Mafdul&quot; are among his works.
* Zurarah ibn Ayan in Kufa was a disciple of al-Hakam ibn Utayba before joining al-Baqir. As a prominent traditionist and theologian, Zurarah played an important role in developing the Shia thought. Zurarah lived long enough to also become a close disciple of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq.
* Fudayl ibn Yasar is another notable associate of both al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, about whom al-Sadiq said what Muhammad had said about Salman the Persian, that &quot;Fudayl is from us, the Ahl al-Bayt.&quot;
* Maymun ibn al-Aswad al-Qaddah was a devout supporter of al-Baqir and his son, al-Sadiq. Not educated but with an impressive personality, Maymun probably committed to writing what he heard from the Imams. His son, Abd Allah, is the alleged ancestor of the Isma&#x27;ili imams.

<text>CKCO-DT (channel 13) is a television station in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. It is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media alongside London-based CTV 2 station CFPL-DT (channel 10), although the two stations maintain separate operations. CKCO-DT&#x27;s studios are located on King Street West in Kitchener (across from the Grand River Hospital and Ion rapid transit light rail station adjacent to the Waterloo border), and its transmitter is located at Baden Tower between Snyders Road East and Highway 7 in Baden, just west of the Kitchener city limits.

==History==

The station first signed on the air at 6 p.m. on March 1, 1954. Its signal transmitted from the Baden Tower (a transmitter on Baden Hill), near Baden, just west of Kitchener. The transmitter has become one of the most identifiable landmarks in the area. Originally, like all privately owned television stations in Canada from 1953 to 1959, CKCO was an affiliate of the CBC; it became an affiliate of CTV in 1963. The station increased its transmitter power in the early 1960s to reach London, from which Kitchener then received CBC affiliate programs on CFPL-TV.
CKCO was originally owned by Central Ontario Television, a consortium that included the Famous Players theatre chain (now owned by Cineplex Entertainment) and businessman Carl Arthur Pollock, president of the family-owned television manufacturer Electrohome, although his broadcast holdings – which also included radio stations CFCA-FM and CKKW – were operated by a separate company. At one time, CKCO was owned by CAP Communications, whose name was taken from Pollock&#x27;s initials; a corporate reorganization in 1970 placed the stations directly under the ownership of Electrohome, which also acquired control of CKCO when Canadian broadcasting laws required domestic ownership of stations, ending the involvement of American-owned Famous Players, which at the time was owned by Paramount Pictures&#x27; parent company Gulf + Western (the latter was acquired by the original Viacom). CKCO would become the first station in Canada to provide closed captioning for all of its local newscasts, in 1988.

In the 1990s, Baton Broadcasting had owned competing local stations in southwestern Ontario (CFPL-TV in London, CHWI-TV in Windsor, CKNX-TV in Wingham). A deal between Electrohome and Baton in 1996 resulted in each company owning 50% of these stations, as well as CKCO-TV, among other Canadian stations. The following year, another deal gave Baton control over CKCO-TV, while CHUM Limited took control over the other southwestern Ontario stations (which presently operate as owned-and-operated stations of the CTV Two television system). CTVglobemedia reacquired CFPL, CHWI, and CKNX in 2007 as a result of a takeover of CHUM Limited.

In 1998, Baton changed its name to CTV Inc. after becoming the sole owner of CTV, ending the decades of cooperative ownership of the network. In 2000, BCE purchased CTV Inc. and combined it with NetStar Communications and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; into Bell Globemedia. The company changed its name in 2007 to CTVglobemedia after BCE reduced its ownership interest. In September 2010, BCE re-acquired full ownership of CTV Inc., which changed its name once again to Bell Media in 2011 when the acquisition was finalized.

On October 3, 2005, CKCO ceased identifying by its call letters, adopting the local brand &quot;CTV Southwestern Ontario&quot;, with its newscasts rebranding from &quot;CKCO News&quot; to &quot;CTV News&quot;. The local brand reflected the fact that, at that time, the station provided some coverage of news in areas southwest of Waterloo Region. While it remains the CTV main-network station for all of Southwestern Ontario, CKCO has since refocused its news-gathering resources exclusively on Waterloo Region and the Guelph area, avoiding direct competition with its sister CTV Two stations in other parts of southwestern Ontario for local news coverage. In early April 2012, presumably to end any confusion about its mandate, the station changed its on-air branding to &quot;CTV Kitchener&quot;.

==Programming==
Before CKCO was a CTV owned-and-operated station, the station produced considerably more local non-news programming:

* &quot;Canadian Bandstand&quot; (1958–1974), resembling &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in some respects. Hosts included Wally Crouter, Gary McLaren, Ron Hill, Reg Sellner, Peter Emmerson and Grant (Grantly) Hoffman.
* &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; (c. 1970s–1992)
* &quot;Camp Cariboo&quot; (1985–1989)
* &quot;Romper Room&quot;, a children&#x27;s program, was broadcast nationally on CTV from the mid-1960s to 1992
* &quot;Polka Time&quot; (originally ), hosted by Grammy Award winning polka musician Walter Ostanek
* &quot;Sunday AM&quot;
* &quot;Provincewide&quot;, anchored by award-winning journalist Daiene Vernile. (1985–2014)
* &quot;Tree House&quot;, a Catholic Christian children&#x27;s program (1972–1990)
*Several programs hosted by Big Al, including the noon-time &quot;Big Al″s Cartoon Capers&quot;, &quot;Big Al″s Talent Showcase&quot;, and &quot;Big Al″s Ranch Party&quot; in the late afternoon
* &quot;The Johnnie Walters Show&quot; was a daily hourlong morning show hosted by Johnnie Walters featuring guests, an exercise segment, horoscopes, and a cooking segment from the mid-1970s and early &#x27;80s. It replaced an earlier show hosted by Walters, &quot;Horoscope Dollars&quot;, featuring Walters calling area residents at random with a question, the correct answer to which depended on them viewing that particular show. Some of the most entertaining moments came during the time spent dialing and waiting for numbers to connect, as he engaged in informal banter with offscreen crew and organist Pat Ludwig.
*&quot;Trivia Company&quot; featured Johnnie Walters and ran from 1983 to 1988. This half-hour show was done in a game show format, and featured Walters taking a mobile unit on the street asking various people trivia questions for cash prizes. The show was revived from 1992 to 1994 by CFPL-TV in London and then CFTO-TV in Toronto.

The station continues to produce a limited amount of local programming in addition to its local newscasts. CKCO presently broadcasts church services each Sunday morning at 10 a.m. from two Kitchener area churches: St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church and St. Peters Lutheran Church, which are alternated each week. CKCO serves as the flagship station for CTV&#x27;s broadcasts of the Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest parade, which is held each Thanksgiving Day in the Twin Cities.

===Newscasts and other local programming===
CKCO-DT presently broadcasts 15 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with three hours each weekday). Prior to 1998, when Baton Broadcasting rebranded all the CTV stations identically, CKCO&#x27;s newscast was called &quot;CKCO Action News&quot;. In the past, the station&#x27;s newscasts were branded as &quot;Scan NewsHour&quot; and &quot;Ontario Report&quot;.

The station operates a news bureau in Chatham, Ontario, and also had a bureau in Windsor at the corner of Park Street and Victoria Avenue, on the ground floor of the Victoria Park Place apartments. This bureau was shut down in 1994, shortly after the launch of independent station/semi-BBS affiliate CHWI. The spot was abandoned for several years, still showing the faded &quot;CKCO-TV 42&quot; banners atop its storefront for a few years (it is now home to a convenience store).

News veterans who had their start at the station include Jeff Hutcheson, Lisa LaFlamme and Ron Johnston. Bill Inkol was a long-time sportscaster not only for the station, but often for CTV&#x27;s national sports broadcasts. He was also a host of &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot;. &quot;Big Al&quot; (&quot;Al&quot; Elwood Jones) was the long-time host of after-school &quot;Big Al&#x27;s Ranch Party&quot;, &quot;Big Al″s Talent Showcase&quot;, &quot;Big Al″s Cartoon Capers&quot;, &quot;Big Al and the Flintstones&quot;, as well as other children&#x27;s programs at the station.

Oopsy the Clown, a children&#x27;s performer portrayed by St. Thomas native Bob McNea (1929–2005), moved to CKCO after appearing for several years on Detroit NBC affiliate WWJ-TV (now WDIV-TV), where he served as Detroit&#x27;s &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot;. During the 1970s, it was found that the cartoons seen on &quot;Bozo&quot; were too violent and WWJ executives offered Bob the opportunity to create a new clown show. During a &quot;Bozo&quot; episode it was announced that Bozo was leaving television to go back and join the circus. He phoned his clown cousin &quot;Oopsy&quot; and during a split screen conversation (with Bob playing both Bozo and Oopsy) Oopsy agreed to replace him. &quot;The Oopsy the Clown Show&quot; aired for a while on WWJ as McNea decided to move back to Canada and join CKCO-TV.

Gary McLaren worked in the station&#x27;s news department for 39 years from 1957 to 1996, spending most of that time in an on-air role, and also hosted &quot;Canadian Bandstand&quot; in the 1960s and the weekend newsmagazine show &quot;Sunday AM&quot;. Daiene Vernile anchored and produced the weekly program &quot;Provincewide&quot; from 1985 until April 2014, making it the longest continuously running, locally produced newsmagazine program in Canada. Other personalities during the station&#x27;s history included local daytime show hosts such as Elaine Cole, Betty Thompson and Johnnie Walters. Thompson was also a long-time host of &quot;Romper Room&quot;. Bob Bratina hosted Polka Time with Walter Ostanek and replaced &quot;Big Al&quot; as host of Talent Showcase prior to Oopsy the Clown and his talent show &quot;Big Top Talent&quot;.

CKCO was known for many years for the red jackets worn by news anchors on their newscasts, a practice that began in 1967 with the emergence of colour television and continued until 1989. On August 18, 2012, the Saturday edition of &quot;CTV News at Six&quot; was expanded to one hour replacing &quot;The Beat&quot;. On April 20, 2014, the Sunday edition of &quot;CTV News at Six&quot; was also expanded to an hour replacing the long-running show &quot;Provincewide&quot;.

From January 2017, local news was presented in 16:9 SD. On September 18, 2017, CTV Kitchener launched its own edition of &quot;CTV News at Five&quot;. Bell Media initially announced that high-definition production of CTV News Kitchener would commence on September 25. However, the launch date was delayed to October 2, with &quot;CTV News at Noon&quot; being the first local newscast to be presented in high-definition from the CTV Kitchener studios.

CKCO&#x27;s noon and weekend newscasts were cancelled on February 8, 2024, as part of nationwide programming cuts by Bell Media.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
As part of Canada&#x27;s transition to digital television, CKCO flash-cut to digital on August 31, 2011. While originally allocated channel 7 for its digital signal, CKCO-DT was established on channel 13 instead in order to avoid interference with the digital signal of Buffalo, New York&#x27;s WBBZ-TV.

===Former rebroadcasters===
CKCO was also previously seen in the Bruce Peninsula and Georgian Bay region on channel 2 from the CKCO-TV-2 transmitter at Wiarton, which began operation in 1971.

CKCO-TV-2 was on a long list of CTV rebroadcasters nationwide that was set to shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators. A subsequent change in ownership assigned full control of CTVglobemedia to Bell Media; as a result, CKCO-TV-2 remained in normal licensed broadcast operation.

In February 2014, CKCO-TV-2 was shut down as a result of a power failure combined with a property dispute with a neighbouring landowner, which blocked service vans from driving up to the site to make repairs, forcing technicians to walk through fields in snowshoes in cold winter weather. A diesel generator kept the transmitter in operation in the short term, but it would later fail, with the ongoing property dispute blocking efforts to repair that as well. Bell Media applied to surrender its license for CKCO-TV-2 to the CRTC in August 2014, after CKCO received fewer than thirty calls from viewers and advertisers regarding the outage, as well as the fact that the transmitter cost six times more to run than the amount taken in.
In addition to the Baden tower, CKCO was served in the Sarnia area by rebroadcaster CKCO-TV-3, on UHF channel 42. This transmitter, actually located at Oil Springs, was established on May 16, 1975, and commenced broadcasts on November 5 of that year. The station was available over-the-air and on cable in extreme eastern and southeastern Michigan in such towns as Port Huron and St. Clair Shores, and appeared in Detroit-area television listings. The station targeted Sarnia, Chatham, and most of Lambton and Kent counties. CKCO continues to be carried in these areas, along with Windsor and Essex County on Cogeco Cable on channel 13 (SD only; HDTV is provided in these areas by sister station CFTO).

Programming on CKCO-TV-3 was originally the same as the main CKCO signal, except for local inserts during newscasts and local commercials. In 2009, it was announced that CKCO-TV-3 was scheduled to cease producing distinct local programming by August 31 of that year, but expected to continue operations as a rebroadcaster. As of September 2009, CKCO-TV-3 ceased airing alternate local programming for the Sarnia and Chatham area and became a direct simulcast of CKCO-DT.

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down CKCO-TV-3 as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. This transmitter was shut down on May 2, 2020.

Prior to 1999, the station also broadcast on channel 11 to Muskoka and Parry Sound from the CKCO-TV-4 transmitter at Dwight, near Huntsville. This transmitter first signed on the air on February 25, 1976. In 1999, that transmitter began relaying the signal of CKNY-TV in North Bay; it has since become a rebroadcaster of Sudbury&#x27;s CICI.

<doc id="429922" wikidata="Q386707" url="?curid=429922" title="HM Prison Wandsworth">
<text>HM Prison Wandsworth is a Category B men&#x27;s prison at Wandsworth in the London Borough of Wandsworth, South West London, England. It is operated by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service and is one of the largest prisons in the UK.

==History==

The prison was built in 1851, when it was known as Surrey House of Correction. It was designed according to the humane separate system principle with a number of corridors radiating from a central control point with each prisoner having toilet facilities. The toilets were later removed to increase prison capacity and the prisoners had to &quot;slop out&quot;, until 1996.

On 29 July 1879, Catherine Webster was executed for the murder and dismemberment of her mistress, Mrs. Thomas, at Richmond. The murder, which occurred in March, was for the purpose of stealing Mrs. Thomas&#x27; property and going to America with a man named Webb. The only witnesses to the execution were the sheriff, the surgeon and the chaplain. No reporters were permitted. The sheriff reported that Mrs. Webster met her death with dignity. The body was buried in a shallow grave on prison grounds and covered in lime.

In 1930, inmate James Edward Spiers, serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery, took his own life in front of a group of justices of the peace who were there to witness his receiving 15 lashes, then a form of judicial corporal punishment.

In 1951, Wandsworth was the holding prison for a national stock of the birch and the cat o&#x27; nine tails, implements for corporal punishment inflicted as a disciplinary penalty under the prison rules. An example of a flogging with the &quot;cat&quot; carried out in Wandsworth Prison itself was reported in July 1954.

On 8 July 1965, Ronnie Biggs escaped from the prison, where he was serving a 30-year sentence for his part in the Great Train Robbery. Two years later he fled to Brazil and remained on the run until 2001, when he returned to the UK.

The prison was originally designed to hold less than a thousand inmates, but as of 2023, there are between 1,300 and 1,500 prisoners.

===Execution site===
Wandsworth was the site of 135 executions, between 1878 and 1961. Built in 1878, the gallows was located near the A wing. In 1911, a new gallows was built between the E and F wings, and in 1938 a further gallows was built at the E wing. Among those executed by hanging were:

*Alfred Charles Whiteway (22 December 1953)
*Guenther Podola (5 November 1959)
*Francis Forsyth (10 November 1960)
On 25 April 1951, a double execution took place at Wandsworth, when Edward Smith and Joseph Brown stood on the gallows together and were executed simultaneously. The final executions at Wandsworth were those of Francis Forsyth on 10 November 1960, Victor John Terry on 25 May 1961 and Henryk Niemasz on 8 September 1961 (Forsyth was one of just four 18-year-olds executed in a British prison in the twentieth century).

With the exceptions of Scott-Ford, who was convicted of treachery, and Joyce and Amery, who were convicted of treason, all executions were for the crime of murder. 

The gallows were kept in full working order until 1993 and tested every six months. In 1994, they were dismantled and the condemned suite is now used as a tea room for prison officers. The gallows&#x27; trapdoor and lever were sent to the Prison Service Museum in Rugby, Warwickshire. After this museum permanently closed in 2004, they were sent to the Galleries of Justice in Nottingham, where those and an execution box may be seen.

===Recent history===

In October 2009, gross misconduct charges were brought against managers of Wandsworth Prison, after an investigation found that prisoners had been temporarily transferred to HMP Pentonville before inspections. The transfers, which included vulnerable prisoners, were made in order to manipulate population figures.

In March 2011, an unannounced follow-up inspection was conducted by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, which found that &quot;...Wandsworth compared badly with similar prisons facing similar challenges and we were concerned by what appeared to be unwillingness among some prison managers and staff to acknowledge and take responsibility for the problems the prison faced.&quot;

In May 2015 a prisoner was found dead in his cell, prompting a murder investigation.

On 6 September 2023, Daniel Abed Khalife, on remand awaiting trial in relation to terrorism and the Official Secrets Act, escaped from the prison. The escape caused significant disruption at airports and ports around the UK due to enhanced security checks. He was found and arrested in the Northolt area on 9 September 2023.

In June 2024, the prison was investigated after a video emerged that allegedly showed a prison officer having sex with one of the inmates.

==The prison today==
Wandsworth Prison contains eight wings on two units. The smaller unit, containing three wings, was originally designed for women. This unit houses prisoners who attend full time activities.

Education and training courses are offered at Wandsworth. Facilities at the prison include two gyms and a sports hall. The large prison chaplaincy offers chaplains from the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, Mormon, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness faiths.

A BBC investigation showed large-scale drug abuse, with cannabis being openly smoked and harder drugs found. There are allegations of staff corruption, including of staff bringing drugs into the prison. Wandsworth has lost its status as a reform prison. Glyn Travis of the Prison Officers Association said, &quot;Wandsworth staff had bought into the reform process and worked well with the governor to implement the reforms. Now, the prison has lost its reform status and once again, staff and prisoners have been left high and dry as this government&#x27;s agenda seems to change at the drop of a hat.&quot; Wandsworth is the most overcrowded prison in England, and body scanners were not used on visitors to prevent contraband being brought into the prison, allegedly due to shortage of staff. Peter Clarke said, &quot;In essence, there were too many prisoners, many with drug-related or mental-health issues, and with not enough to do.&quot; Also, not all staff carried anti-ligature knives despite six suicides since 2015.

Chris Atkins&#x27; book &quot;A Bit of a Stretch: The Diaries of a Prisoner&quot; describes ongoing poor conditions during his stay in 2016–2017 with many of the touted improvements merely being on paper rather than having been implemented. He describes some of the attempted changes as part of the &quot;Prison and Safety Reform (2016)&quot; that were not successful.

<text>Carl Ray Kasell (; April 2, 1934 – April 17, 2018) was an American radio personality. He was a newscaster for National Public Radio, and later was the official judge and scorekeeper of the weekly news quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; until his retirement in 2014.

==Early life==
A native of Goldsboro, North Carolina, Carl Ray Kasell was a student of drama in high school, where one of his mentors was Andy Griffith, then a high school drama instructor. Although Griffith urged Kasell to pursue a career in theatre, Kasell preferred radio. Kasell began practicing his newscaster voice as a child and got his first on-air job at 16. In an interview with Renée Montagne just before his final broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, Kasell revealed that he knew he would be in radio at a young age. He said that he hid behind the radio to fool passers-by into thinking they were listening to the radio when they in fact were hearing the young Kasell.

During his time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Kasell helped launch local radio station WUNC with fellow student and future broadcaster Charles Kuralt. Kasell pursued a degree in English, but never graduated due to being drafted into the U.S. Army. After serving, he worked as an announcer and DJ at radio station WGBR in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He moved to Northern Virginia in 1965.

==Career==
After leaving North Carolina, Kasell first worked as an announcer and DJ at WPIK in Alexandria, Virginia. He soon joined the staff of all-news WAVA in Arlington, Virginia as a weekend news announcer, and eventually advanced to the position of news director. He hired Katie Couric, then a student at the University of Virginia, as an intern one summer, thus starting her career in news broadcasting.

Kasell joined National Public Radio&#x27;s staff as a news announcer for &quot;Weekend All Things Considered&quot; in 1975. He was the news announcer for NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; from its inception in 1979 through 2009.

Kasell&#x27;s voice was also heard on the radio in &quot;Bee Movie&quot; during one scene.

On November 23, 2009, NPR announced that Kasell would retire from newscasting at the end of 2009. Kasell&#x27;s final newscast aired on December 30, 2009. 
He continued to work for NPR through fundraising and visits to member stations.
He also continued to appear as the official scorer of &quot;Wait Wait ... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;

=== &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; ===
NPR launched its weekly news quiz &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; in 1998, with Kasell as official judge and scorekeeper. Kasell featured in several segments including &quot;Who&#x27;s Carl This Time?&quot; and the &quot;Listener Limerick Challenge.&quot;

Prior to October 21, 2017, listeners who won a game on the show could have Kasell record a greeting for their home answering machine or voice mail system. More than 2,000 people have had his voice on their answering machines, which he recorded even after he left the show. 
During the August 7, 2010, broadcast of &quot;Wait Wait ... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, host Peter Sagal announced that Kasell had been voted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

For many years, Kasell was the announcer for the annual Kennedy Center Honors broadcast on CBS.

On March 4, 2014, NPR announced that Kasell would be stepping down from his &quot;Wait Wait ... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; duties. It was later announced that his last show would be May 17, 2014; subsequently he was credited on the air as &quot;Scorekeeper Emeritus&quot;.

== Retirement and death ==
Kasell&#x27;s final show on &quot;Wait Wait ... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; was recorded on May 15, 2014, and broadcast two days later. Stephen Colbert, Katie Couric, Tom Hanks, and President Barack Obama called in to the show to voice their appreciation for Kasell.

In September 2014, Kasell published his memoir titled &quot;Wait Wait ... I&#x27;m Not Done Yet!&quot;

Kasell died on April 17, 2018, from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Potomac, Maryland.

<text>Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far () was the eldest son of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq and the sixth Imam in Isma&#x27;ilism. He carried the epithet of al-Mubarak, on the basis of which one of the earliest Isma&#x27;ili groups became designated as the Mubarakiyya.

It seems likely that the Mubarakiyya, were originally supporters of Isma&#x27;il before acknowledging Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il as their Imam. At any rate, Mubarakiyya was thus one of the original names of the nascent Isma&#x27;iliyya, a term coined by later heresiographers. A faction of the Mubarakiyya later developed into the Fatimid Isma&#x27;ilis, upholding the continuity of the Imamate in the progeny of al-Mubarak, acknowledging al-Mubarak himself as their sixth Imam. This enumeration was subsequently retained by the various branches of the Isma&#x27;ili.

A major crisis arose among the Shia after the death of Ja’far al-Sadiq, who had five sons. Abd Allah al-Aftah and Isma&#x27;il al-Mubarak were the eldest sons by his first wife Fatima, a granddaughter of Hasan Ibn Ali. Al-Mubarak was probably the second son of al-Sadiq. The exact date and circumstances of al-Mubarak&#x27;s death also remain obscure. According to some Isma&#x27;ili authors, al-Mubarak survived al-Sadiq. Some sources, mainly Twelver texts, report that al-Mubarak died during the lifetime of al-Sadiq—but those same sources also report that al-Mubarak was seen several days later in Basra, suggesting that he did not really die but was sent away out of Medina.

== Sources ==
Information about the life of Isma&#x27;il al-Mubarak, his connections and the movement carried out by his followers is extremely rare. Among the early works, only a few Twelver sources give some information about the subject. However, due to open rivalry between the Isma&#x27;ilis and the Twelvers, the information derived from the Twelver books always carries the risk of being one-sided and thus its authenticity is open to doubt. On the other hand, early Isma&#x27;ili sources give almost nothing for this period. As the Islamicist Farhad Daftary observes, because of being religious and philosophical in their character contain little historical information on the initial period of the sect, and those which have information, because of the views contained in them were in conflict with the official Fatimid doctrines, probably were subjected to later censorship by the Fatimid Isma&#x27;ilis.

An important Isma&#x27;ili work is ʿUyūn al-Akhbār written by Idris Imad al-Din (d. 1468), an Isma&#x27;ili da&#x27;i in Yemen. One volume of this work contains some important historical material relating to al-Mubarak and his son Muhammad. According to the orientalist Vladimir Ivanov (d. 1970), Idris quoted this information literally from an early work, Sharḥ al-Akhbār fī Faḍāʾil al-Aʾimma al-Aṭhār, written by the Isma&#x27;ili jurist and theologian Abu Hanifa Nu&#x27;man ibn Muhammad al-Tamimi, who is well-known as al-Qadi al-Nu&#x27;man (d. 974). Another work of Idris is Zahr al-Maʾānī; it gives a review of the Isma&#x27;ili Imams. The third Isma&#x27;ili work is Asrār al-Nuṭaqāʾ written by Ja&#x27;far ibn Mansur al-Yaman, a contemporary of al-Qadi al-Nu&#x27;man. The main subject of the book is the story of Abraham, and the proofs of the right of al-Mubarak to the Imamate. As Ivanov says, it contains a strong controversial element directed against the Twelvers.

==Life==
Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad al-Mubarak&#x27;s birth date is unknown, but apparently he was the second son of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, born between 80 and 83/699–702. His mother, Fatima bint al-Husayn al-Athram ibn al-Hasan ibn Ali, was the first wife of al-Sadiq. Her mother was Asma, daughter of Aqil ibn Abi Talib. The Sunni theologian Muhammad al-Shahrastani () writes in his Kitāb al-Milal wa al-Niḥal that during the lifetime of Fatima, al-Sadiq never got another marriage like Muhammad with Khadija and Ali with Fatima. Al-Mubarak was the full-brother of Abd Allah al-Aftah, the Imam of the Fathiyya (or Aftahiyya).

The early life of al-Mubarak is obscure except few fragmented records. He was alive in 133/751, when Dawud ibn Ali, the governor of Medina, executed Mu&#x27;alla ibn Khunays probably because of his agency on behalf of al-Sadiq and his involvement in some revolutionary activities of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, al-Sadiq, as soon as he heard the news of the execution of Mu&#x27;alla, went to the governor with his son al-Mubarak and called him to account for this murder. The governor Dawud put the blame on his chief of shurta (the chief of his police force), al-Sayrafi. According to the Twelver al-Kashshi (), al-Sadiq directed al-Mubarak to kill al-Sayrafi, which he did. In Idris&#x27; report, al-Sadiq then handed him over to al-Mu&#x27;alla&#x27;s associates and they killed him.

Riyah ibn Uthman al-Murri, the Abbasid governor in Medina burnt the house of Ahl al-Bayt, and al-Mubarak was decided to be killed. Ahmad ibn Ali al-Najashi () writes in his Kitāb al-Rijāl, that al-Mubarak was involved in a militant anti-Abbasid plot in collaboration with several others, which included Bassam ibn Abdullah Sayrafi, a radical Shia engaged in money lending in Kufa. Bassam was brought out dead; Isma&#x27;il was spared probably due to his father&#x27;s status. Muhammad Hasan al-Muzaffar () quotes al-Sadiq as saying that, &quot;Isma&#x27;il was planned two times for killing, but I prayed for his life, and God protected him.&quot; This association is one of several reported by the Twelver sources which caused al-Sadiq to express his dissatisfaction with those radical Shias who were leading his son astray.

==Imamate==

=== Designation ===
According to the majority of the available sources, al-Sadiq had indeed designated al-Mubarak by &quot;nass&quot; (divine decree) as his successor in Imamate. This fact was accepted as the formal act of nass required by Shia theory and was therefore a designation by an infallible Imam of the new Imam who would inherit the full powers of the Imamate. Al-Mubarak was thus not only al-Sadiq&#x27;s choice but was God&#x27;s choice as well. This designation, in fact, forms the basis of Isma&#x27;ili claims and which should have settled the question of al-Sadiq&#x27;s succession in due course. According to the Isma&#x27;ili tradition, when al-Mubarak was seven years of age, al-Sadiq declared his Imamate. He was separated from his other brothers and kept away from contact with the public. Al-Sadiq himself undertook his education. As da&#x27;i Idris observes, this declaration was made secretly on the basis of taqiyya. Only certain selected followers of al-Sadiq knew this fact. Apparently, though, al-Sadiq did not appoint another in place of al-Mubarak and the theoretical argument by which he might have done so is, generally speaking, missing; although the later Twelver Shias claimed such a nass for Musa ibn Ja&#x27;far al-Kazim, the younger half brother of al-Mubarak, producing several hadiths to this effect. Twelver writers like al-Nawbakhti (d. 922) admitted as much even a hundred years after the fact.

After the death of al-Sadiq a great confusion arose amongst his sons as each of his surviving sons claimed the Imamate but could not produce sufficient credentials, and so their followers melted away in a short period expect for two candidates: al-Mubarak and al-Kazim. Al-Mubarak was some twenty-five years older than his half-brother al-Kazim, who was born in 128/745–46 to a Berber slave-girl. Various historians relate that &quot;all&quot; of the sons of al-Sadiq contended for the position. In Kalām-i Pīr, an Isma&#x27;ili work wrongly attributed to Nasir Khusraw (), there is an account of this contest, which was again carried for decision to the Black Stone at Mecca, as had been done by Zayn al-Abidin and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. This time the decision was in favour of al-Mubarak, after which al-Kazim swears allegiance to him.

Various reasons are given as an explanation for altering the nass al-Sadiq had given to al-Mubarak. That most frequently used by historians, mostly Sunni and Twelver, is that al-Mubarak had been drinking, to which the Isma&#x27;ili could reply, that the Imam being infallible would know a truth concerning drinking beyond the zahir command to abstain from it. More likely, It deserves to note that some bombastic stories of al-Mubarak&#x27;s indulgence in drink and his alleged association with the extremists have been condemned by many historians. Mufaddal ibn Umar al-Sayrafi however relates that al-Sadiq, in view of his son&#x27;s piety had already warned the people in Medina that, &quot;Do not wrong Isma&#x27;il&quot; (la tajafu Isma&#x27;ila).

With regard to the Twelver Shia claims that al-Mubarak had pre-deceased al-Sadiq, the Isma&#x27;ilis believe that al-Sadiq observed &quot;taqiya&quot; (dissimulation) and gave a chance to his real successor to go underground so that their enemy, the Abbasids, did not pursue al-Mubarak, and that his Imamate and his activities went un-noticed. Thus al-Kazim who was believed to be poisoned by the Abbasid Caliph Harun was in fact a veil (&quot;hija&quot;b) for al-Mubarak. The Sunni historian Rashid al-Din Hamadani () wrote that some Isma&#x27;ilis believed that al-Kazim willingly gave his life for the sake of his elder brother al-Mubarak, the true Imam. The Isma&#x27;ilis further argued that the Imam being &quot;ma&#x27;sum&quot; (infallible) could not make an error of Judgement and therefore the first &quot;nass&quot; (designation) of al-Sadiq was the correct one. Thus, this group accepted al-Mubarak as their Imam and are known as Isma&#x27;iliyya or Isma&#x27;ilis.

=== Relations with radical Shias ===
Al-Mubarak evidently had contacts with the activist Shias in his father&#x27;s following, including al-Mufaddal ibn Umar al-Ju&#x27;fi. According to the historian al-Maqrizi (d. 1442), al-Mufaddal regarded al-Sadiq as God, so the Imam repudiated him and publicly cursed him. Al-Mubarak, who was reportedly involved in certain anti-Abbasid plots, may also have collaborated with Abu al-Khattab al-Asadi, another activist Shia originally in the entourage of al-Sadiq. Abu al-Khattab had been active in the Shia group with al-Sadiq, but the latter had to repudiate him openly, because of his extremist theological view, which he had endeavoured to enforce by militant means, though Abu al-Khattab supposedly maintained that the repudiation was part of al-Sadiq&#x27;s technique at preserving his true nature. The Asrār also states that al-Sadiq had to forbid al-Mubarak to go to the school which Abu al-Khattab had been conducting.

Louis Massignon (d. 1962) has suggested that Abu al-Khattab was the spiritual or adoptive father of al-Mubarak, hence his kunya of Abu Isma&#x27;il. In this connection, he formulated a general hypothesis, contending that since the beginning of the second Islamic century, the expression anta minna Ahl al-Bayt (&#x27;you are from the Prophet&#x27;s family&#x27;) purportedly used by Muhammad in reference to Salman the Persian, and as reported in a hadith, had acquired a ritual value indicating &#x27;spiritual adoption&#x27; amongst the revolutionary Shias, for whom real family ties were established through spiritual parentage, adoption or initiation. Possible collaboration between al-Mubarak and Abu al-Khattab remains shrouded in obscurity, despite the fact that the Twelver sources, generally hostile to the Isma&#x27;ilis, identify the nascent Isma&#x27;ili with the early Khattabiyya; the later Isma&#x27;ilis regarded Abu al-Khattab as a heretic and repudiated the Khattabiyya.

=== The doctrine of bada ===
The Twelver Shia believe that al-Sadiq revoked his first &quot;nass&quot; in favour of al-Mubarak with radical Shias and made a second &quot;nass&quot; in favour of his son al-Kazim. This newly contrived theory took its early nourishment among the people who lacked the concept of the Imamate. The Twelver scholar Abdulaziz Abdulhussein Sachedina confirms the problems inherent in the doctrine of bada: &quot;It implied God&#x27;s change of mind (bada) because of a new consideration, caused by the death of Isma&#x27;il. However, such connotations in the doctrine of bada (change of mind) raised serious questions about the nature of God&#x27;s knowledge, and indirectly, about the ability of the Imams to prophesy future occurrences.&quot; Al-Sadiq is also reported to have said: &quot;Inlillah fi kullo shain bida illah Imamah&quot; means, &quot;Verily, God makes changes in everything except in the matter of Imam.&quot; This point merits further indication al-Sadiq had no power to cancel, revoke or alter the first nass in favour of al-Mubarak, and therefore, the tradition of change of nass carries no historicity. Al-Nawbakhti writes in Kitāb Firaq al-Shīʿa that, &quot;Yet another version is that by appointing his son, Isma&#x27;il, as an Imam, al-Sadiq thus resigned. Isma&#x27;il was therefore a real Imam, and after him, the Imamate has to pass to his son, Muhammad.&quot; Al-Shahrastani writes in Kitāb al-Milal wa al-Niḥal that, &quot;Designation (nass), however, cannot be withdrawn, and has the advantage that the Imamate remains in the descendants of the person designated, to the exclusion of others. Therefore, the Imam after Isma&#x27;il is Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il.&quot;

=== Succession ===
The Mubarakiyya claimed that, when al-Mubarak was alive, he appointed his son Muhammad as his heir and sent his da&#x27;is to different regions to administer the oath in his name. Another proto-Isma&#x27;ili group which is recorded by the sources deemed that al-Sadiq, not al-Mubarak, designated Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il as the seventh Imam, and he was the last Imam and the Mahdi who remained alive and would return as the Qa&#x27;im. This group is said to have formed the nucleus of the Qaramita sect which regarded Muhammad as their seventh and last Imam. Ja&#x27;far ibn Mansur al-Yaman writes in Asrār al-Nuṭaqāʾ that, &quot;Both we and you admit the tradition that when Isma&#x27;il was about to die, he summoned his son and his followers, and handed over the Imamate to him, in their presence, under the supervision of his father [al-Sadiq]. He entrusted the testimony concerning the position of his son to one of his ḥujjats [i.e. da&#x27;is], as did his forefather Ishmael (Isma&#x27;il) with regard to the person surnamed al-Kabsh [], appointed before him. He made him the &quot;veil&quot; for his heir, to distract towards him the attention of the tyrants of the time. And al-Sadiq presided over the assembly, as Jacob (Ya&#x27;qub) presided over the assembly of Joseph (Yusuf) when the latter was on his deathbed.&quot;

The Mubarakiyya held that the right of the Imamate must pass from al-Mubarak, the father, to Muhammad, the son, because the Imamate could not be transferred from brother to brother after the case of Imams al-Hasan and al-Husayn, the sons of &#x27;Ali ibn Abi Talib: it can only go to [the Imam&#x27;s] progeny. This was why they rejected the claims of al-Kazim and other brothers of al-Mubarak, as they did that of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, who, according to them, had falsely claimed the Imamate in rivalry with Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-Abidin. At any rate, it is clear that the Mubarakiyya had come into existence in Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s lifetime and they were originally his supporters. It may safely be assumed that Mubarakiyya was one of the original name of the nascent Isma&#x27;ilism, as well as the regional identifications of the followers of al-Mubarak, who, on the whole, merged into the main fold of Isma&#x27;ilism in the time of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il.

Al-Nawbakhti, who is best informed about this period, says that the group which supported Muhammad was called the Mubarakiyya after al-Mubarak who was a client, or mawla, of Isma&#x27;il. Ivanov has shown that al-Mubarak was the epithet of Isma&#x27;il himself, on the basis of some passages from the famous Isma&#x27;ili da&#x27;i of the 4th/10th century, Abu Ya&#x27;qub al-Sijistani, as well as other sources.

== Death ==
The exact date and the circumstances of al-Mubarak&#x27;s death also remain unknown. According to the Isma&#x27;ili tradition, al-Mubarak died in 158/775, and was buried at the Maqam al-Imam () in Salamiyah, a city located in Syria. However, non-Isma&#x27;ili sources report that he died in Medina, and was buried in the Baqi cemetery there. The historians quote the tradition that al-Mubarak had died during his father&#x27;s lifetime, but the followers of al-Mubarak refused to believe the rumours of his death. Al-Shahrastani writes in Kitāb al-Milal wa al-Niḥal that, &quot;Some of them [followers of Isma&#x27;il] say that he did not die, but that his father had declared that he had died to save him from the Abbasid caliphs; and that he had held a funeral assembly to which al-Mansur&#x27;s governor in Medina was made a witness.&quot; Hasan ibn Nuh al-Bharuchi (), an Indian Isma&#x27;ili author, relates visiting al-Mubarak&#x27;s grave in 904/1498. His grave was still there in 1302/1885, but it was later destroyed, along with other graves in the Baqi, by the Wahhabis.

Many Isma&#x27;ili and non-Isma&#x27;ili sources state that during al-Mubarak&#x27;s funeral procession al-Sadiq attempted to show the face of his dead son to witnesses. Some of the same sources also indicate that al-Mubarak was seen soon afterward in Basra, where he cured a paralytic in the market.

Another group claimed that he did not die but went into occultation, that he would appear again and would be the promised Mahdi. These Imami Shias further believed that al-Sadiq had announced al-Mubarak&#x27;s death merely as a ruse to protect him from the persecution of the Abbasids who were angered by his political activities. The Twelver heresiographers al-Nawbakhti and al-Qummi call the members of this group, who recognised al-Mubarak as their Imam Mahdi, al-Isma&#x27;iliyya al-khalisa (), while some later heresiographers such as al-Shahrastani designate this group as &quot;al-Isma&#x27;iliyya al-waqifa&quot; which refers to those who stopped their line of Imams with al-Mubarak. The Twelver theologian Muhammad al-Mufid (d. 1022) records that in his time they were extremely rare and there was no knowledge of anyone from them who could be pointed out.

==Family==
Besides Muhammad, al-Mubarak had a son called Ali, who was born in 130/748 and a daughter, Fatima.

<text>The Texas A&amp;M University System is a state university system in Texas and is one of the state&#x27;s seven independent university systems.

The Texas A&amp;M University System is one of the largest systems of higher education in the United States, with a budget of $6.3 billion. Through a statewide network of 11 universities, 8 state agencies, and the RELLIS Campus, the Texas A&amp;M System educates more than 153,000 students and makes more than 22 million additional educational contacts through service and outreach programs each year. System-wide, research and development expenditures exceeded $996 million in FY 2017 and helped drive the state&#x27;s economy.

The system&#x27;s flagship institution is Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. The letters &quot;A&amp;M&quot; (originally A.M.C. for &quot;agricultural and mechanical college&quot;) are retained to honor the university&#x27;s former designation.


==Component institutions==
The founding member of the A&amp;M System is Texas A&amp;M University, established in 1876. Prairie View A&amp;M, also established in 1876, is an HBCU. The A&amp;M System, like all schools in Texas was racially segregated by state law, from its founding until the 1960s. Many of the member universities and agencies joined the A&amp;M System decades after being established. The institution now named The University of Texas at Arlington was a member from 1917 to 1965.

==Agencies==
With a direct presence in all 254 Texas counties, A&amp;M System agencies offer research and service to the state&#x27;s citizens. The agencies focus on addressing and improving the social, economic, educational, health and environmental conditions of Texans.
* Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research
* Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service
* Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES)
* Texas A&amp;M Engineering Extension Service (TEEX)
* Texas A&amp;M Forest Service 
* Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute
* Texas A&amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory
* Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM)

TDEM is the only state agency under the Texas A&amp;M System not to bear the &quot;Texas A&amp;M&quot; name as it is the most recent to be added to the system, transferred from the Texas Department of Public Safety to TAMUS in 2019.

==Texas A&amp;M Health==
Established in 1999, as the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center, Texas A&amp;M Health is the medical education component of Texas A&amp;M University and reaches across all parts of Texas through its institutions: Texas A&amp;M University College of Dentistry at Dallas; the College of Medicine at College Station, Temple, Dallas, Round Rock, and Houston; the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Dallas, College Station and Houston; the School of Engineering Medicine and Institute of Biosciences and Technology in Houston; the School of Public Health at College Station and McAllen; and the Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy in College Station and Kingsville. Southern regions of the state also are further served by the Coastal Bend Health Education Center, which covers the 19-county region surrounding Corpus Christi and Kingsville, and the South Texas Center at McAllen.

Texas A&amp;M Health received full accreditation in December 2002 from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, doctoral and professional degrees. Its components are accredited by accrediting organizations specific to their areas.

The Health Science Center in 2013 was merged into Texas A&amp;M University proper and is no longer an independent institution. It was renamed Texas A&amp;M Health.

===Academic units===
* Institute of Biosciences and Technology 
* Texas A&amp;M University School of Dentistry
* Texas A&amp;M University School of Engineering Medicine
* Texas A&amp;M University School of Medicine
* Texas A&amp;M University School of Nursing
* Texas A&amp;M Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences
* Texas A&amp;M University Irma Lerma Rangel School of Pharmacy
* Texas A&amp;M University School of Public Health

===Regional centers===
* Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Coastal Bend Health Education Center 
* Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center South Texas Center

==Governance and administration==
The System is governed by a nine-member Board of Regents. Each member is appointed by the Governor of Texas for a six-year term and the terms overlap (all terms end on February 1 in odd-numbered years and in those years 1/3 of the regents&#x27; terms expire, though a regent can be nominated for another subsequent term).

In addition, a tenth &quot;student regent&quot; (non-voting member) is appointed by the Governor for a one-year term.

The responsibilities of the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents are to:

*Oversee the administration and set policy direction for the System&#x27;s 11 universities, seven state agencies and health science center;
*Ensure a quality undergraduate and graduate education experience for all students;
*Promote academic research and technology to benefit the state of Texas and the nation;
*Disseminate programs of the A&amp;M System across the state through outreach and public service efforts; and
*Support the state legislative and higher education leadership to position Texas at the forefront of higher education nationally.

Additionally, the Texas A&amp;M University System is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a public-private coalition that &quot;advocates for public policies and funding to support the rapid development, production, stockpiling, and distribution of critically needed medical countermeasures&quot;.
