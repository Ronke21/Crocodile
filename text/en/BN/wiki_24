<text>Dactylanthus taylorii, commonly known in English as wood rose and in Māori as (&quot;flower of the underworld&quot;), is a fully parasitic flowering plant, the only one endemic to New Zealand. The host tree responds to the presence of &quot;Dactylanthus&quot; by forming a burl-like structure that resembles a fluted wooden rose (hence the common name). When the flowers emerge on the forest floor, they are pollinated by a ground-foraging species of native bat.

==Description==

&quot;Dactylanthus taylorii&quot; is a round, warty, tuber-like stem (up to 50 cm wide) or haustorium with no roots, which draws nutrients from the roots of its host. Its leaves do not photosynthesise, and are reduced to floral bracts. Some plants have been aged in excess of 30 years old. &quot;Dactylanthus&quot; prefers damp but not waterlogged soil, and is often found at the head of small streams. It parasitises about 30 species of native hardwood trees and shrubs, preferring those growing in secondary forest on the margin of mature podocarp forest. Common hosts include patē/seven-finger (&quot;Schefflera digitata&quot;), five-finger (&quot;Neopanax arboreus&quot;), lemonwood (&quot;Pittosporum eugenioides&quot;), and putaputaweta (&quot;Carpodetus serratus&quot;).

== Wood rose ==

The plant takes its common name from the attachment point between tuber and host. The host&#x27;s roots expand to form a fluted disk, resembling a flower. This growth was once dug up in the thousands, incidentally killing the &quot;Dactylanthus&quot;, and sold as a collectable, often ending up as &quot;a mantlepiece curiosity.&quot; It is illegal to collect wood roses from public land, and harvesting this threatened species is strongly discouraged.

==Taxonomy and naming==
&quot;Dactylanthus taylorii&quot; was first discovered by Europeans in March 1845, when Rev. Richard Taylor came across it 12 km south of Raetihi. In 1856 Taylor took a specimen to Joseph Hooker in England, who formally described the species in 1859. The genus name is derived from the Greek &quot;(dáktulos),&quot; “finger”, and &quot;(ánthos),&quot; “flower”. The specific epithet &quot;(taylorii&quot;, originally &quot;Taylori)&quot; honours Rev. Taylor. It is the only species in the genus.

Taylor stated that the Māori name for wood rose was pua reinga (more grammatically, te pua o Te Rēinga, &quot;flower of the underworld&quot;, poetically rendered by Hooker as &quot;flower of Hades&quot;). Hill noted that at least in the Taupō region this name referred to a different parasitic plant, &quot;Thismia&quot;, and claimed the Māori name for &quot;Dactylanthus&quot; was waewae atua, &quot;feet or toes of the spirits/gods&quot;.

The closest relative of &quot;Dactylanthus&quot; is &quot;Hachettea&quot; from New Caledonia. Along with &quot;Mystropetalon&quot; from South Africa, they comprise the Southern Hemisphere group Mystropetalaceae. All three are holoparasites, lacking chlorophyll, and are descended from hemiparasitic root parasites, which could photosynthesise.

== Reproduction ==
Plants are dioecious, either male or female, and only rarely hermaphrodites. They flower between February and May and are primarily pollinated by the native short-tailed bat. Male flowers produce nectar that provides a simple but very sweet fragrance which promotes bat-pollination.
Analysis of fossil coprolites suggest the kākāpō (&quot;Strigops habroptilus&quot;), a flightless nocturnal parrot, was also a pollinator. Pollinated plants produce fruits slightly under long. The nectar exudes a musky smell that resembles mammalian sweat. Introduced mice and rats also pollinate them, although rats tend to destroy them.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Dactylanthus&quot; is currently found only in the North Island, although there is evidence from fossil pollen it lived recently in the northern South Island. It ranges from Puketi Forest in Northland through the Coromandel Peninsula as far south as Mt Bruce, and from Mt Taranaki to Te Araroa on the East Coast. It also lives on Little Barrier Island. The plant is cryptic and hence hard to survey. Many sites likely are known only to collectors, as the woody growth has commercial value. In 2020 plants from Pureora Forest were transplanted to Zealandia and Otari-Wilton&#x27;s Bush reserves in Wellington. Ngā Manu Nature Reserve in Waikanae has two established, flowering sites as well as two sites added in 2021.

== Conservation status ==

&quot;Dactylanthus&quot; is regarded, as of 2012, as Threatened – Nationally Vulnerable. The New Zealand Department of Conservation started a recovery plan in 1995. The wood rose is under threat from harvesting by collectors, browsing by possums, rats, pigs and deer, habitat loss, and the rarity of its pollinators and seed dispersers. Control of the browsing mammals that feed on &quot;Dactylanthus&quot;, especially possums and kiore, is one conservation strategy. Another is to enclose the plants in protective cages. Because cages also exclude the plant&#x27;s pollinators, its flowers then need to be hand-pollinated, and the resulting seed set turns out to be no better than in uncaged plants. &quot;Dactylanthus&quot; has recently been successfully translocated in the wild by sown seeds in closed-canopy forest.

<doc id="430881" wikidata="Q705852" url="?curid=430881" title="Percy Lavon Julian">
<text>Percy Lavon Julian (April 11, 1899 – April 19, 1975) was an American research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants. Julian was the first person to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, and a pioneer in industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry&#x27;s production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and artificial hormones that led to birth control pills.

Julian started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the wild Mexican yams. His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs, including synthetic cortisone.

Julian was one of the first African Americans to be allowed to earn a doctorate in chemistry. He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the second African-American scientist, after David Blackwell, inducted into the organization from any field. Throughout his career, Julian received over 130 patents.

==Early life and family==
Percy Lavon Julian was born on April 11, 1899, in Montgomery, Alabama, as the first child of six born to James Sumner Julian and Elizabeth Lena Adams Julian. Both of his parents were graduates of what was to be Alabama State University. His father, James was employed as a clerk in the Railway Service of the United States Post Office, and his mother Elizabeth was a schoolteacher.

==Education and academic career==
At a time when access to an education beyond the eighth grade was extremely rare for African Americans, Julian&#x27;s parents steered all of their children toward higher education. Julian attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated nature of the town subjected him to social humiliations. He was not allowed to live in a college dormitory and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals. It took him days before he found an establishment where he could eat. He later found work firing the furnace, waiting tables, and doing other odd jobs in a fraternity house; in return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and eat at the house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 as a Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian.

By 1930, his father had moved the family to Greencastle so that all his children could attend DePauw. He still worked as a railroad postal clerk. James owned his own home, valued at $3,000 (approximately $ today).

After graduating from DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his doctorate in chemistry, but learned it would be difficult for an African American to do so. Instead, he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that white students would resent being taught by an African American, Harvard withdrew Julian&#x27;s teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. there.

In 1929, while an instructor at Howard University, Julian received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to continue his graduate work at the University of Vienna, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1931. He studied under Ernst Späth and was considered an impressive student. Europe gave him freedom from the racial prejudices that had stifled him in the States. He freely participated in intellectual social gatherings, attended the opera, and found greater acceptance among his peers. Julian was one of the first African Americans to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry, after St. Elmo Brady and Edward M.A. Chandler. 

After returning from Vienna, Julian taught for one year at Howard University. At Howard, in part due to his position as a department head, Julian became caught up in university politics, setting off a chain of scandals. At university president Mordecai Wyatt Johnson&#x27;s request, he goaded white professor of chemistry Jacob Shohan (Ph.D., Harvard), into resigning. In late May 1932, Shohan retaliated by releasing to the local African-American newspaper the letters Julian had written to him from Vienna. The letters described &quot;a variety of subjects from wine, pretty Viennese women, music and dances, to chemical experiments and plans for the new chemical building.&quot; In the letters, he spoke with familiarity, and some derision, of members of the Howard University faculty, calling one well-known dean an &quot;ass (also known as a donkey)&quot;.

Around this same time, Julian also became entangled in an interpersonal conflict with his laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson. Julian had recommended Thompson for dismissal in March 1932. Thompson sued Julian for &quot;alienating the affections of his wife&quot;, Anna Roselle Thompson, stating he had seen them together in a sexual tryst. Julian counter-sued him for libel. When Thompson was fired, he too gave the paper intimate and personal letters which Julian had written to him from Vienna. Julian&#x27;s letters revealed &quot;how he fooled the [Howard] president into accepting his plans for the chemistry building&quot; and &quot;how he bluffed his good friend into appointing&quot; a professor of Julian&#x27;s liking. Through the summer of 1932, the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; published all of Julian&#x27;s letters. Eventually, the scandal and accompanying pressure forced Julian to resign.

On December 24, 1935, he married Anna Roselle (Ph.D. in sociology, 1937, University of Pennsylvania). They had two children: Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. (August 31, 1940 – February 24, 2008), who became a noted civil rights lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin; and Faith Roselle Julian (born 1944), who still resides in their Oak Park home and often makes inspirational speeches about her father and his contributions to science.

At the lowest point in Julian&#x27;s career, his former mentor, William Martin Blanchard, a professor of chemistry at DePauw, threw him a much-needed lifeline. Blanchard offered Julian a position to teach organic chemistry at DePauw in 1932. Julian then helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, to come to the United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935, Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the quoted melting point of Robinson&#x27;s end product was incorrect, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the calabar bean.

Julian also extracted stigmasterol, which took its name from &quot;Physostigma venenosum&quot;, the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for the synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.

==Private sector work: Glidden==
===Hiring===
In 1936 Julian was denied a professorship at DePauw for racial reasons. DuPont offered a job to Pikl, but declined to hire Julian, despite his superlative qualifications as an organic chemist, apologizing that they were &quot;unaware he was black&quot;. Julian next applied for a job at the Institute of Paper Chemistry in Appleton, Wisconsin. However, Appleton was a sundown town, forbidding African Americans from staying overnight, explicitly stating &quot;No Negro should be a bed or boarded overnight in Appleton.&quot;

Meanwhile, Julian had written to the Glidden Company, a supplier of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his starting point for the synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was experiencing infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O&#x27;Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, telephoned Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden&#x27;s Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O&#x27;Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.

Julian supervised the assembly of the plant at Glidden when he arrived in 1936. He then designed and supervised the construction of the world&#x27;s first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints.

At the start of World War II, Glidden sent a sample of Julian&#x27;s isolated soy protein to National Foam System Inc. (today a unit of Kidde Fire Fighting), which used it to develop Aer-O-Foam, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s firefighting &quot;bean soup.&quot; While it was not exactly Julian&#x27;s brainchild, his meticulous care in the preparation of the soy protein made the firefighting foam possible. When a hydrolyzate of isolated soy protein was fed into a water stream, the mixture was converted into a foam by means of an aerating nozzle. The soy protein foam was used to smother oil and gasoline fires aboard ships and was particularly useful on aircraft carriers. It has saved the lives of thousands of sailors and airmen. Citing this achievement, in 1947 the NAACP awarded Julian the Spingarn Medal, its highest honor.

The 1943 United States Office of War Information film &quot;Food for Fighters&quot; features Julian as the soy expert when describing the inclusion of soy to boost the nutrition of K-rations.

===Steroids===
Percy&#x27;s research at Glidden changed direction in 1940 when he began work on synthesizing progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone from the plant sterols stigmasterol and sitosterol, isolated from soybean oil by a foam technique he invented and patented. At that time, clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered hormones. However, only minute quantities could be extracted from hundreds of pounds of animal spinal cords.

In 1940, Julian was able to produce of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy stigmasterol was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone that he produced, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to buyer Upjohn in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.

His work made possible the production of these hormones on a larger industrial scale, with the potential of reducing the cost of treating hormonal deficiencies. Julian and his co-workers obtained patents for Glidden on key processes for the preparation of progesterone and testosterone from soybean plant sterols. Product patents held by a former cartel of European pharmaceutical companies had prevented a significant reduction in wholesale and retail prices for clinical use of these hormones in the 1940s. He saved many lives with this discovery.

On April 13, 1949, rheumatologist Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic announced the dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The cortisone was produced by Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett, starting with deoxycholic acid from cattle bile acids. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improved process for producing cortisone. This eliminated the use of osmium tetroxide, which was rare and expensive. By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol) of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein&#x27;s Substance S, and most often referred as 11-Deoxycortisol), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately they were not.

On April 5, 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn published the first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydrocortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydrocortisone (cortisol).

After two years, Glidden abandoned production of cortisone to concentrate on Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden&#x27;s cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.

In 1953, Glidden decided to leave the steroid business, which had been relatively unprofitable over the years despite Julian&#x27;s innovative work. On December 1, 1953, Julian left Glidden after 18 years, giving up a salary of nearly $50,000 a year () to found his own company, Julian Laboratories, Inc., taking over the small, concrete-block building of Suburban Chemical Company in Franklin Park, Illinois.

On December 2, 1953, Pfizer acquired exclusive licenses of Glidden patents for the synthesis of Substance S. Pfizer had developed a fermentation process for microbial 11β-oxygenation of steroids in a single step that could convert Substance S directly to 11β-hydrocortisone (cortisol), with Syntex undertaking large-scale production of cortexolone at very low cost.

==Oak Park and Julian Laboratories==
Around 1950, Julian moved his family to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, becoming the first African-American family to reside there. Although some residents welcomed them, there was also opposition. Before they moved in, on Thanksgiving Day, 1950, their home was firebombed. Later, after they moved in, the house was attacked with dynamite on June 12, 1951. The attacks galvanized the community, and a community group was formed to support the Julians. Julian&#x27;s son later recounted that during these times, he and his father often kept watch over the family&#x27;s property by sitting on the front porch with a shotgun.

Julian&#x27;s new research firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc., hired many of his best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden. He won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, he would have to use the same Mexican yam, obtained from the Mexican barbasco trade, as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new yam source in Guatemala for the company.

In July 1956, Julian and executives of two other American companies trying to enter the Mexican steroid intermediates market appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. They testified that Syntex was using undue influence to monopolize access to the Mexican yam. The hearings resulted in Syntex signing a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department. While it did not admit to restraining trade, it promised not to do so in the future. Within five years, large American multinational pharmaceutical companies had acquired all six producers of steroid intermediates in Mexico, four of which had been Mexican-owned.

Syntex reduced the cost of steroid intermediates more than 250-fold over twelve years, from $80 per gram in 1943 to $0.31 per gram in 1955. Competition from Upjohn and General Mills, which had together made very substantial improvements in the production of progesterone from stigmasterol, forced the price of Mexican progesterone down to less than $0.15 per gram in 1957. The price continued to fall, bottoming out at $0.08 per gram in 1968.

In 1958, Upjohn purchased 6,900 kg of progesterone from Syntex at $0.135 per gram, 6,201 kg of progesterone from Searle (who had acquired Pesa) at $0.143 per gram, 5,150 kg of progesterone from Julian Laboratories at $0.14 per gram, and 1,925 kg of progesterone from General Mills (who had acquired Protex) at $0.142 per gram.

Despite continually falling bulk prices of steroid intermediates, an oligopoly of large American multinational pharmaceutical companies kept the wholesale prices of corticosteroid drugs fixed and unchanged into the 1960s. Cortisone was fixed at $5.48 per gram from 1954, hydrocortisone at $7.99 per gram from 1954, and prednisone at $35.80 per gram from 1956. Merck and Roussel Uclaf concentrated on improving the production of corticosteroids from cattle bile acids. In 1960 Roussel produced almost one-third of the world&#x27;s corticosteroids from bile acids.

Julian Laboratories chemists found a way to quadruple the yield on a product on which they were barely breaking even. Julian reduced their price per kg for the product from $4,000 to $400. He sold the company in 1961 for $2.3 million (equivalent to $ million today) and became one of the first black millionaires. The U.S. and Mexico facilities were purchased by Smith Kline, and Julian&#x27;s chemical plant in Guatemala was purchased by Upjohn.

In 1964, Julian founded Julian Associates and Julian Research Institute, which he managed for the rest of his life. Julian also helped to found the Legal Defense and Educational Fund of Chicago.

Julian died of liver cancer in Waukegan, Illinois on April 19, 1975, a week after his 76th birthday.

===&quot;Nova&quot; documentary===
Ruben Santiago-Hudson portrayed Percy Julian in the Public Broadcasting Service &quot; Nova&quot; documentary about his life, called &quot;Forgotten Genius&quot;. It was presented on the PBS network on February 6, 2007, sponsored by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation with further funding by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Approximately sixty of Julian&#x27;s family members, friends, and work associates were interviewed for the docudrama.

Production on the biopic began in May 2002 at DePauw University&#x27;s Greencastle campus, where Julian&#x27;s bust is on display in the atrium of the Percy Lavon Julian Science and Mathematics Center. The completion and broadcast of the documentary was delayed while &quot;Nova&quot; commissioned and published a companion book on Julian&#x27;s life.

According to University of Illinois historian James Anderson in the film, &quot;His story is a story of great accomplishment, of heroic efforts and overcoming tremendous odds...a story about who we are and what we stand for and the challenges that have been there and the challenges that are still with us.&quot;

<text>The World Hockey Association (WHA) was a proposed professional hockey league intended to compete with the established National Hockey League during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Noteworthy for instability and failed plans, its organization operated several minor and junior leagues thereafter.

==History==
Seeking to capitalize upon the original World Hockey Association of the 1970s, Allan Howell and Dr. Nick Vaccaro announced in 2003 the formation of a new professional hockey league calling itself the &quot;World Hockey Association.&quot; Original WHA superstar Bobby Hull was named its commissioner. The league was regarded by many as an attempt to fill the void that loomed as the NHL&#x27;s serious labour problems, which led to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Most hockey commentators felt that the league&#x27;s best hope was to operate while the NHL players were locked out and try to develop enough of a following to survive once the NHL labour problems were resolved.

It was projected that the league would begin operation with teams from Dallas, Detroit, Halifax, Hamilton, Miami, Toronto, Vancouver and Quebec City. Five teams went so far as to acquire nicknames: the Detroit Gladiators (which planned to play at the Pontiac Silverdome, a venue that had never hosted hockey before); the Dallas Americans (which introduced Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Ed Belfour as goalie/co-owner); the Quebec Nordiks (a tweaking of the old Quebec Nordiques nickname); the Toronto Toros (adopting the nickname of the original WHA team of the same name); and the Halifax IceBreakers.

After being pushed back from June 2, a WHA draft took place on July 18, 2004 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Future superstar Sidney Crosby was the first pick; he turned down the league&#x27;s three-year, $7.5 million offer. By August, however, things began to unravel: the WHA pulled the Quebec franchise and Toronto, unable to find an arena, dropped out soon afterwards. The Florida-based franchise, apparently headed for Miami, then Jacksonville and finally Orlando, quietly expired. By September, the new WHA was down to four teams and had pushed its debut back to November. By October, Dallas had folded and an announced &quot;restructuring&quot; never took place.

In the spring of 2005, the league announced the &quot;Bobby Hull Invitational Tournament,&quot; for which 50 NHL players had purportedly showed interest. The tournament, scheduled to begin May 20 and award $2 million to the winning team, was dropped without comment by the organization and never held.

When that and other plans failed to materialize, the rights to the WHA&#x27;s name and logo were sold to Richard Smith, a British Columbia investor. Further plans to operate either a similar Tier II junior league or a professional loop in the Pennsylvania-Midwest area in 2007–2008 were dropped without comment by the organization, in addition to financial problems that led to the company&#x27;s stockbroker calling for a legal investigation and subsequently filing a lawsuit against the WHA.

The organization operated three now-defunct leagues, two playing a single season each before folding and the third playing two seasons; the minor-league World Hockey Association 2 and the WHA Super Junior League in Florida, the latter which was abandoned with little to no warning to players and the communities involved. It operated an unsanctioned Tier II developmental league in British Columbia called the WHA Junior West Hockey League between 2006 and 2008, marked by financial and franchise instabilities that saw the WHA&#x27;s stock price drop to a fraction of a penny per share. While the organization announced a third season for the Junior West Hockey League, no teams were ever iced or games played, and the league&#x27;s website was taken down after September 2008.

The mustard-coloured areas are part of the [[Glebe|[[demesne]]]], the [[hatching|hatched]] areas part of the [[Glebe|glebe]].

Glebe (, also known as church furlong, rectory manor or parson&#x27;s close(s)) is an area of land within an ecclesiastical parish used to support a parish priest. The land may be owned by the church, or its profits may be reserved to the church.

==Medieval origins==
In the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian traditions, a glebe is land belonging to a benefice and so by default to its incumbent. In other words, &quot;glebe is land (in addition to or including the parsonage house/rectory and grounds) which was assigned to support the priest&quot;.

The word &quot;glebe&quot; itself comes from Middle English, from the Old French (originally from or , &quot;clod, land, soil&quot;).

Glebe land can include strips in the open-field system or portions grouped together into a compact plot of land. In early times, tithes provided the main means of support for the parish clergy, but glebe land was either granted by any lord of the manor of the church&#x27;s parish (sometimes the manor would have boundaries coterminous with the parish but in most instances it would be smaller), or accumulated from other donations of particular pieces of land. Occasionally all or part of the glebe was , &quot;devoted&quot; or &quot;assigned&quot; to a priory or college. In the case where the whole glebe was given to impropriators they would become the lay rector(s) (plural where the land is now subdivided), in which case the general law of tithes would resume on that land, and in England and Wales chancel repair liability would now apply to the lay rectors just as it had to the rector.

The amount of such land varied from parish to parish, occasionally forming a complete glebe farm. From 1571 onwards, the incumbent of the benefice would record information about the glebe at ecclesiastical visitations in a &quot;glebe terrier&quot; (Latin &quot;terra&quot;, land). Glebe land could also entail complete farms, individual fields, houses (messuages), mills or works. A holder of a benefice could retain the glebe for his own use, usually for agricultural exploitation, or he could &quot;farm&quot; it (i.e., lease it, a term also used) to others and retain a rent as income.

==Britain==

===Church of England===
Glebe associated with the Church of England ceased to belong to individual incumbents as from 1 April 1978, by virtue of the Endowments and Glebe Measure 1976 (No. 4). It became vested on that date, &quot;without any conveyance or other assurance&quot;, in the Diocesan Board of Finance of the diocese to which the benefice owning the glebe belonged, even if the glebe was in another diocese. But see &#x27;Parsonages &amp; Glebe Diocesan Manual 2012&#x27; for current legislation.

===Scotland===
Glebe land in Scotland was subject to the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 33), section 30, which meant that it would be transferred little by little to the General Trustees of the Church of Scotland.

==Anglo-America==
In Bermuda and the Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain where the Church of England was the established church, glebe land was distributed by the colonial government and was often farmed or rented out by the church rector to cover living expenses. The Dutch Reformed Church also provided glebes for the benefit of the pastor; it continued this practice through at least the 1850s. In some cases associations with former glebe properties is retained in the local names, for example: Glebe Road in Arlington County, Virginia, the community of Glebe in Hampshire County, West Virginia, Glebe Mountain in Londonderry, Windham County, Vermont, Glebe Hill, near Tucker&#x27;s Town, Bermuda, another Glebe Hill in Southampton Parish, Bermuda, and The Glebe Road in Pembroke Parish, Bermuda. Ottawa neighbourhood The Glebe was originally land dedicated to support St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church.

The Baptist, Presbyterian and other churches that were not established in Virginia succeeded in 1802 and passage in the legislature of the Glebe Act, whereby whether glebes were sold by the overseers of the poor for the benefit of the indigent in the parish. The Episcopal Church was weakened by the new law, but in the Carolinas the glebes remained in the hands of the church and either were worked by the minister or rented out by them.

<text>Lobelia () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae comprising 415 species, with a subcosmopolitan distribution primarily in tropical to warm temperate regions of the world, a few species extending into cooler temperate regions. They are known generally as lobelias.

==Description==
The genus &quot;Lobelia&quot; comprises a substantial number of large and small annual, perennial and shrubby species, hardy and tender, from a variety of habitats, in a range of colours. Many species appear totally dissimilar from each other. However, all have simple, alternate leaves and two-lipped tubular flowers, each with five lobes. The upper two lobes may be erect while the lower three lobes may be fanned out. Flowering is often abundant and the flower colour intense, hence their popularity as ornamental garden subjects.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lobelia&quot; was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species plantarum&quot; and was named after the Flemish botanist Matthias de Lobel (1538–1616).

&quot;Lobelia&quot; is probably the base form from which many other lobelioid genera are derived; it is therefore highly paraphyletic and not a good genus in a cladistic sense. For example, the Hawaiian species (see Hawaiian lobelioids), currently classified in several genera, originated from a single introduction to a now-submerged Hawaiian Island 15 million years ago, probably from an Asian &quot;Lobelia&quot; in &quot;Lobelia&quot; subg. &quot;Tupa&quot;.

A New Zealand study concluded that local species of&quot; Hypsela, Isotoma&quot; and &quot;Pratia&quot; should be treated as Lobelia.

===Species list===
See List of &quot;Lobelia&quot; species

==Ecology==
&quot;Lobelia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Setaceous Hebrew Character.

==Cultivation and uses==
Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens. These include &quot;Lobelia cardinalis&quot; syn. &quot;Lobelia fulgens&quot; (cardinal flower or Indian pink), &quot;Lobelia siphilitica&quot; (blue lobelia), and &quot;Lobelia erinus&quot;, which is used for edging and window boxes.

===Hybrids===
Numerous hybrids have been produced, notably &quot;Lobelia&quot; × &quot;speciosa&quot;, a hybrid derived from &quot;L. fulgens&quot;, &quot;L. cardinalis&quot; &amp; &quot;L. siphilitica&quot;. The term &quot;fan hybrids&quot; is also used. This plant is borderline hardy and requires fertile, moist soil. It is suitable for summer bedding schemes or growing in containers. The cultivars &#x27;Kompliment Scharlach&#x27; and &#x27;Pink Elephant&#x27; 
have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 
===Traditional medicine===
The species used most commonly in modern herbalism is &quot;Lobelia inflata&quot; (Indian tobacco). Use of lobelia for cardiovascular diseases may cause adverse effects.

Lobelia has been used as &quot;asthmador&quot; in Appalachian traditional medicine. Two species, &quot;L. siphilitica&quot; and &quot;L. cardinalis&quot;, were once considered a cure for syphilis. Herbalist Samuel Thomson popularized medicinal use of lobelia in the United States in the early 19th century.

==Adverse effects==
Many members of the genus are considered poisonous, with some containing the toxic principle lobeline. Because of lobeline&#x27;s similarity to nicotine, the internal use of lobelia may be dangerous to susceptible populations, including children, pregnant women, and individuals with cardiac disease. Excessive use will cause nausea and vomiting. It is not recommended for use by pregnant women and is best administered by a practitioner qualified in its use. It also has a chemical known as lobellicyonycin, which may cause dizziness.

==Chemical constituents==
Extracts of &quot;Lobelia inflata&quot; contain lobeline and those from &quot;Lobelia chinensis&quot; contain apigenin, lobeline, lobelanine, isolobelanine, lobelanidine, quercetin, coumarins, glucosides and other flavonoids.


===Mexican spurred lobelias===
About eleven species native to Mexico and Central America have spurs on the flowers. These spurred lobelias appear to form a monophyletic group. Most have been classified in the genera &quot;Heterotoma&quot; (or sometimes &quot;Calcaratolobelia&quot;). However, since their closest relatives such as &quot;Lobelia anatina&quot; are in &quot;Lobelia&quot;, Koopman and Ayers classify them in &quot;Lobelia&quot;.

<text>Educational research refers to the systematic collection and analysis of evidence and data related to the field of education. Research may involve a variety of methods and various aspects of education including student learning, interaction, teaching methods, teacher training, and classroom dynamics.

Educational researchers generally agree that research should be rigorous and systematic. However, there is less agreement about specific standards, criteria and research procedures. As a result, the value and quality of educational research has been questioned. Educational researchers may draw upon a variety of disciplines including psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy. Methods may be drawn from a range of disciplines. Conclusions drawn from an individual research study may be limited by the characteristics of the participants who were studied and the conditions under which the study was conducted.

==General characteristics==

Gary Anderson outlined ten aspects of educational research:

* Attempt to discover cause and effect.
* Research involves gathering new data from primary or first-hand sources or using existing data for a new purpose.
* Research is based upon observable experience or empirical evidence.
* Research demands accurate observation and description.
* Research generally employs carefully designed procedures and rigorous analysis.
* Research emphasizes the development of generalizations, principles or theories that will help in understanding, prediction and/or control.
* Research requires expertise—familiarity with the field; competence in methodology; technical skill in collecting and analyzing the data.
* Research attempts to find an objective, unbiased solution to the problem and takes great pains to validate the procedures employed.
* Research is a deliberate and unhurried activity which is directional but often refines the problem or ques

==Approaches==
There are different approaches to educational research. One is a basic approach, also referred to as an academic research approach. Another approach is applied research or a contract research approach. These approaches have different purposes which influence the nature of the respective research.

===Basic approach===
Basic, or academic research focuses on the search for truth or the development of educational theory. Researchers with this background &quot;design studies that can test, refine, modify, or develop theories&quot;. Generally, these researchers are affiliated with an academic institution and are performing this research as part of their graduate or doctoral work.

===Applied approach===
The pursuit of information that can be directly applied to practice is aptly known as applied or contractual research. Researchers in this field are trying to find solutions to existing educational problems. The approach is much more utilitarian and pragmatic as it strives to find information that will directly influence practice. The goal of applied research is &quot;to determine the applicability of educational theory and principles by testing hypotheses within specific settings&quot;. Contractual research is commissioned by a sponsor. 

===Comparison of basic and applied research===
The following are several defining characteristics written by Gary Anderson to compare basic (academic) and applied (contract) research.

==Methodology==

The basis for educational research is the scientific method. The scientific method uses directed questions and manipulation of variables to systematically find information about the teaching and learning process. In this scenario questions are answered by the analysis of data that is collected specifically for the purpose of answering these questions. Hypotheses are written and subsequently proved or disproved by data which leads to the creation of new hypotheses. The two main types of data that are used under this method are qualitative and quantitative.

===Qualitative research===
Qualitative research uses the data which is descriptive in nature. Tools that educational researchers use in collecting qualitative data include: observations, conducting interviews, conducting document analysis, and analyzing participant products such as journals, diaries, images or blogs.

Types of qualitative research include:
* Case study
* Ethnography 
* Phenomenological research 
* Narrative research
* Historical research

===Quantitative research===
Quantitative research uses data that is numerical and is based on the assumption that the numbers will describe a single reality. Statistics are often applied to find relationships between variables.

Types of quantitative research include:
* Descriptive survey research
* Experimental research
* Single-subject research
* Causal-comparative research
* Correlational research
* Meta-analysis

===Mixed methods (Pragmatic)===
There also exists a new school of thought that these derivatives of the scientific method are far too reductionist in nature. Since educational research includes other disciplines such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, science, and philosophy and refers to work done in a wide variety of contexts it is proposed that researchers should use &quot;multiple research approaches and theoretical constructs.&quot; This could mean using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods as well as common methodology from the fields mentioned above. In social research this phenomenon is referred to as triangulation (social science). This idea is well summarized by the work of Barrow in his text An introduction to philosophy of education:

Types of mixed methods include:
* Action research
* Program evaluation

In analysis of mixed methods, the following ways might be used;
*&quot;Explanatory mixed method&quot;: starts with quantitative followed by qualitative data and results
*&quot;Exploratory mixed method&quot;: starts with qualitative followed by quantitative data and results
*&quot;Triangulation mixed method&quot;: all data and results are concurrently analysed

==Organization of research fields==
Discipline-based education research (DBER) is an interdisciplinary research enterprise that &quot;investigates learning and teaching in a discipline [normally from the STEM fields] from a perspective that reflects the discipline&#x27;s priorities, worldview, knowledge, and practices.&quot;
Examples include:
* Astronomy education research (AER)
* Biology education research (BER)
* Chemistry education research (CER)
* Computer science education research (CSER), also computing education research
* Engineering education research (EER)
* Geoscience education research (GER)
* Mathematics education research (MER)
* Physics education research (PER)

Educational research can also be organized by the subject or object of focus, as in school, teacher, student, etc., the relationship between actors such as student-teacher, teacher-principal, school-home, etc. by educational outcomes, such as motivation, learning of core subjects, learning of 21st century skills, attitudes, etc.

== Results ==
In response to increased attention to the replicability of experimental findings in the sciences and medicine, in 2014, &quot;Educational Researcher&quot; published a review of the entire publication history of the 100 education journals with the highest five-year impact factors that found that out of 164,589 articles published only 221 articles (or 0.13 percent) were attempted replications of previous studies. Only 28.5 percent of the replication studies were direct replications rather than conceptual replications (i.e. usage of a different experimental method to test the same hypothesis). 48.2 percent of the replications were performed by the same research team as produced the original study, and when the same research team published the replication studies in the same journals, 88.7 percent of replications were successful while only 70.6 percent were successful when published in a different journal. When different researchers attempted to replicate the findings, only 54 percent of replications were successful.

, among more than 300 other psychology and medical journals, the &quot;British Journal of Developmental Psychology&quot;, the &quot;British Journal of Educational Psychology&quot;, the &quot;Canadian Journal of School Psychology&quot;, &quot;Exceptional Children&quot;, &quot;Frontiers in Education&quot;, the &quot;Gifted Child Quarterly&quot;, the &quot;Journal for the Education of the Gifted&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Advanced Academics&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Cognition and Development&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Educational Psychology&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition&quot;, &quot;JMIR Medical Education&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Numerical Cognition&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Research in Reading&quot;, &quot;Language Learning&quot;, &quot;Learning and Instruction&quot;, &quot;Mind, Brain, and Education&quot;, and &quot;Scientific Studies of Reading&quot; have adopted result-blind peer review (i.e. where studies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed, but before the studies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the theoretical justifications for their statistical analysis techniques before data collection or analysis is done) as part of an initiative organized by the Center for Open Science in response to concerns about publication bias and &quot;p&quot;-hacking. Early analysis of such reforms in psychology journals has estimated that 61 percent of result-blind studies have led to null results, in contrast to an estimated 5 to 20 percent in earlier psychological research.

<text>Thomas Iver Bradley (born March 17, 1954) is an American novelist, essayist and writer of short stories. He is the author of The Sam Edwine Pentateuch, a five-book series, of which various volumes have been nominated for the Editor&#x27;s Book Award, the New York University Bobst Prize, and the AWP Award Series in the Novel. Tom Bradley&#x27;s nonfiction is regularly featured by Arts &amp; Letters Daily, and has also appeared in Salon.com, McSweeney&#x27;s Internet Tendency, and Ambit Magazine. He has been characterized as an &quot;outsider&quot; by the LA Times book blog.

His sixth book, &quot;Fission Among the Fanatics&quot;, was named Non-Fiction Book of the Year 2007 by 3:AM Magazine, with the citation, &quot;a literary giant among pygmies&quot;. NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu called the book &quot;the first appearance of a genre so strange we are turning away from naming it...&quot; The publication of his seventh book, &quot;Lemur&quot;, by Raw Dog Screaming Press is part of the Bizarro fiction movement. According to &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;[&quot;Lemur&quot;] could do as much to raise the rainbow flag as two medium-size Midwestern Stonewall Day parades.&quot; Tom Bradley has meanwhile contributed to the theoretical elucidation of the Bizarro aesthetic with his criticism and his interviews. His eighth novel, &quot;Vital Fluid&quot;, is based on the life, writings and performances of stage hypnotist John-Ivan Palmer and was published by Crossing Chaos Enigmatic Ink.

His twentieth book, &quot;Family Romance&quot; (illustrated by Nick Patterson), is forthcoming from Debra Di Blasi&#x27;s Jaded Ibis Press, described by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as a &quot;hotpoint where the novel is undergoing radical transformation to reflect its time.&quot;

==Biography==
Tom Bradley was born in Utah during a time when hydrogen bomb tests were still performed above ground. Later, he lived in the People&#x27;s Republic of China for many years and lost friends in the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

The author has stated that as an unintended victim of US nuclear testing, he gravitated to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where he has written strident criticisms of the Japanese educational system In the opinion of Israeli journalist Barry Katz, who writes for 3:AM Magazine in Paris, Tom Bradley deliberately courts controversy: &quot;He does seem bent on leaving absolutely nobody unpissed-off. His venom’s no less ecumenical than gratuitous.&quot; Rain Taxi Review of Books expresses the notion as follows: &quot;As proof of his leaving no one un-offended, he&#x27;s been nudged out of every university where he has taught. For the past two decades he has lived the life of an ex-pat laugh assassin, tucked away in a volcanic mountain on the island of Kyushu&quot;.

However, in composing the Critical Appendix for &quot;Fission Among the Fanatics&quot;, &quot;The Advocate&quot; writer Cye Johan arrived at a different conclusion: &quot;I tell you that Dr. Bradley has devoted his existence to writing because he intends for every center of consciousness, everywhere, in all planes and conditions (not just terrestrial female Homo sapiens in breeding prime), to love him forever, starting as soon as possible, though he&#x27;s prepared to wait thousands of centuries after he&#x27;s dead&quot;.

He claims paternal descent from Mormon handcart pioneers who were excommunicated almost immediately upon arriving in Deseret, from whom he inherited his &quot;whole hefty metabolism&quot; and his remarkable height. 3:AM Magazine describes him as &quot;sociopathically tall.&quot; He also claims to have descended maternally from an earlier Nagasaki expatriate, Thomas Blake Glover.

Regarding the question of the extent to which his fictional alter-ego, Sam Edwine, is autobiographical, Tom Bradley has written that while the character is more intelligent and has had a great variety of experiences that he has not, they are essentially alike.

<doc id="430899" wikidata="Q2032861" url="?curid=430899" title="Dot pitch">
<text>Dot pitch (sometimes called line pitch, stripe pitch, or phosphor pitch) is a specification for a computer display, computer printer, image scanner, or other pixel-based devices that describe the distance, for example, between dots (sub-pixels) on a display screen. In the case of an RGB color display, the derived unit of pixel pitch is a measure of the size of a triad plus the distance between triads.

Dot pitch may be measured in linear units (with smaller numbers meaning higher resolution), usually millimeters (mm), or as a rate, for example, dots per inch (with a larger number meaning higher resolution). Closer spacing produces a sharper image (as there are more dots in a given area). However, other factors may affect image quality, including: 
* Undocumented or inadequately documented measurement method, complicated by ignorance of the existence of different methods
* Confusion of pixels and subpixels
* Element spacing varying across screen area (e.g., widening in corners compared to center)
* Differing pixel geometries
* Differing image and pixel aspect ratios
* Miscellanea such as Kell factor or interlaced video

The exact difference between horizontal and diagonal dot pitch varies with the design of the monitor (see pixel geometry and widescreen), but a typical entry-level 0.28 mm (diagonal) monitor has a horizontal pitch of 0.24 or 0.25 mm, and a good quality 0.26 mm (diagonal) unit has a horizontal pitch of 0.22 mm.

The above dot pitch measurement does not apply to aperture grille displays. Such monitors use continuous vertical phosphor bands on the screen, so the vertical distance between scan lines is limited only by the video input signal&#x27;s vertical resolution and the thickness of the electron beam, so there is no vertical &#x27;dot pitch&#x27; on such devices. Aperture grille only has horizontal &#x27;dot pitch&#x27;, or otherwise known as &#x27;stripe pitch&#x27;.

<doc id="430900" wikidata="Q2036237" url="?curid=430900" title="Independent Belgian Brigade">
<text>The Independent Belgian Brigade (, ) was a Belgian and Luxembourgish military unit in the Free Belgian forces during World War II, commonly known as the Piron Brigade (&quot;Brigade Piron&quot;) after its commanding officer Jean-Baptiste Piron. It saw action in Western Europe and participated in the Battle of Normandy, the Liberation of Belgium, and fighting in the Netherlands over 1944-1945.

==Origins==
&quot;Brigade Piron&quot; originated in 1940, with hundreds of Belgian soldiers who had escaped to Britain, as had the Belgian Government. A new command of the Belgian Army, under Lieutenant-General Victor van Strydonck de Burkel, was created in Tenby on 25 May 1940, three days before the Belgian capitulation. Van Strydonck de Burkel became commander of the Belgian Forces in Great Britain in June 1940 and in the same month, a Belgian minister (Jaspar) called upon all Belgians to come to Britain to continue fighting.

At the end of July 1940 there were 462 men in the Belgian Forces in exile; the arrival of many Belgians allowed the creation of several military units. The troops were trained in Great Britain and Canada and in 1942, Major Jean-Baptiste Piron arrived in Scotland, where he quickly joined the army staff, with the responsibility of improving the training of Belgian troops. In an artillery competition, the Belgian battery came first. The Belgian Forces in Britain were officially made available to the Allies on 4 June 1942. By the end of the year the army had been restructured, including the creation of the 1st Belgian Brigade, under the command of Major Piron, with a mix of infantry, artillery and reconnaissance units. Troop training continued through 1943 and landing exercises were conducted in early 1944. A Luxembourgish unit was assigned to &quot;Brigade Piron&quot; in March, forming an artillery troop. In total about 116 Luxembourgers served in the unit. Because the Belgians had arrived from around the world, thirty-three languages were spoken in the brigade in 1944.

==Normandy invasion==

The D-Day landings took place on 6 June 1944 without &quot;Brigade Piron&quot;, to the great disappointment of its 2,200 men but the British preferred to reserve them for the liberation of Belgium. (This policy was applied to all of the smaller national military contingents, which were expected to form the basis of post-war armies and for whom it would have been difficult to find replacements for casualties.) Piron lobbied the Belgian government in exile, which requested the British Government to send the Belgian troops to the front, to reverse the declining morale of those troops.

On 29 July 1944, the brigade was ordered to be ready to move. Its first units arrived in Normandy on 30 July and the main body arrived at Arromanches and Courseulles on 8 August, before the end of the Battle of Normandy. The brigade operated under the command of the British 6th Airborne Division (Major General Gale), which was part of the First Canadian Army. The Belgians entered active service on 9 August.

The Belgian Brigade participated in Operation Paddle, Clearing the Channel coast from 17 August with British and Dutch (Prinses Irene Brigade) troops of the 6th Airborne Division. Merville-Franceville-Plage was liberated in the evening, Varaville on 20 August. The brigade&#x27;s armoured vehicles were detached to assist British units. Dives-sur-Mer and Cabourg were taken on the morning of 21 August and Houlgate in the afternoon. The brigade took Villers-sur-Mer and Deauville on 22 August, and Trouville-sur-Mer and Honfleur at the mouth of the Seine on 24 August. The bridge connecting the communes of Deauville and Trouville-sur-Mer was renamed to &quot;Pont des Belges&quot; and still bears a commemoration to the brigade which liberated the communes.

The Belgian armoured vehicles were reunited with the rest of the brigade on 26 August at Foulbec. On 28 August 1944, the brigade was placed under the British 49th Infantry Division in order to mop up the Seine estuary and help in the siege of Le Havre. On 29 August, the brigade crossed the Seine to support Operation Astonia, the attack on Le Havre on the following day. At the last moment the brigade was withdrawn from the front and transferred to the Second Army for operations in Belgium. The efforts of &quot;Brigade Piron&quot; on Normandy&#x27;s Côte Fleurie are commemorated by memorials, road names and war graves.

==Belgium and the Netherlands==

On 2 September, the brigade and the Dutch Princess Irene Brigade had been transferred to the Second Army and ordered to move as quickly as possible to the Belgian border. The British were already in Belgium and expected to enter Brussels on the following day and this transfer would allow the Belgian and Dutch Brigades to operate in their homelands. The brigade arrived at the French–Belgian border on 3 September, after an overnight journey and continued to Rongy in Brussels the following day, just after the British.

In early September the brigade acted as guides for British soldiers, attempted to aid Resistance fighters, and took part in mine-clearing at the Evere and Melsbroek airports. The brigade entered northern Belgium on 3 September 1944,

On 11 September 1944, the brigade participated in a battle at the Albert Canal bridgehead and helped to capture Leopoldsburg liberating 900 political prisoners.

During Operation Market Garden the brigade was assigned to guard the right flank of the British 30th corps.

On 25 September 1944 the brigade reached the Wessem canal with fighting reaching its peak on 11 November 1944. Six days later the brigade was withdrawn and reorganized into a proper brigade for the first time at Leuven.

During their advance through Belgium, the Belgian troops were sometimes mistaken for French Canadians, since local people did not expect that their liberators would be fellow Belgians. &quot;Brigade Piron&quot; liberated other Belgian towns and cities before reaching the Netherlands border on 22 September. Its campaign in the Netherlands lasted until 17 November, when it was relieved from the front and moved into reserve in Leuven. In the small Dutch border town of Thorn, a bridge has been named in honour of its liberation on 25 September 1944.

&quot;Brigade Piron&quot; returned to the Netherlands between 11 April 1945 and June 1945. The last casualty of the brigade occurred on 29 April 1945. The next day, the brigade was thrown into battle once again around Nijmegen. On that day also, an armistice was implemented in the Netherlands. The brigade entered Germany in May before being disbanded in December. Its tradition was however preserved in the Bevrijding (Liberation) battalion of the 5th Regiment of the Line.

==Occupation of Germany==
&quot;Brigade Piron&quot; occupied part of the British zone of occupation until 15 December 1945.

==Post-war==

&quot;Brigade Piron&quot; formed the basis of the new Belgian Army. In a reorganisation on 17 November 1945, the brigade&#x27;s artillery and armoured units were reorganised to form specialised regiments and the engineers joined a new engineer battalion. The remaining infantry, reinforced by volunteers, became the First Brigade Liberation, based at Leopoldsburg barracks.

==Order of battle==
In August 1944, the 1st Belgian Brigade consisted of:
*Staff
*British Liaison
*1st, 2nd and 3rd Motorised companies – each with rifle platoons reinforced by mortar, machine gun, anti-tank and anti-aircraft platoons.
*Armoured Car Squadron – 4 squadrons equipped with a mixture of Daimler Armoured Cars, Staghound armoured cars (some armed with anti-aircraft weapons) and Daimler &quot;Dingo&quot; Scout Cars and a supply and recovery squadron
*Artillery Battery – 12 25 pounder gun-howitzers, organised into 3 troops, one of which was Luxembourgish.
*Engineers Company
*Transport Company
*Repair Detachment
*Medical Unit

<doc id="430901" wikidata="Q1152278" url="?curid=430901" title="Little Colorado River">
<text>The Little Colorado River () is a tributary of the Colorado River in the U.S. state of Arizona, providing the principal drainage from the Painted Desert region. Together with its major tributary, the Puerco River, it drains an area of about in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. Although it stretches almost , only the headwaters and the lowermost reaches flow year-round. Between St. Johns and Cameron, most of the river is a wide, braided wash, only containing water after heavy snowmelt or flash flooding.

The lower is known as the Little Colorado River Gorge and forms one of the largest arms of the Grand Canyon, at over deep where it joins the Colorado near Desert View in Grand Canyon National Park. An overlook of the gorge is a Navajo Nation Tribal Park. 

==Course==
The river rises as two forks in the White Mountains of mid-eastern Arizona, in Apache County. The West Fork starts in a valley on the north flank of Mount Baldy at an elevation of nearly , while the East Fork starts nearby. The forks meet in a canyon near the town of Greer, forming the main Little Colorado River. It flows into River Reservoir, then leaves the canyon near Eagar. The river then turns north, meandering through Richville Valley, before emptying into Lyman Lake, impounded by an irrigation dam built in 1912. From there the river continues north, past the town of St. Johns. Shortly afterwards, the river transforms from a perennial stream to an ephemeral wash as it travels northwestwards through Hunt Valley, where it receives the Zuni River, then receiving Silver Creek and the Puerco River—its main tributaries—near the town of Holbrook as it flows into the Painted Desert.

The Little Colorado passes Joseph City and crosses the Southern Transcon route of the BNSF Railway (originally the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad), now winding north into Coconino County. The river enters the Navajo Nation, and drops over the Grand Falls of the Little Colorado shortly after. Below Grand Falls, the river flows through a short but rugged canyon for about . Emerging into the desert again, the Little Colorado skirts the eastern edge of Wupatki National Monument and passes the town of Cameron, where it is bridged by U.S. Highway 89.

From Cameron, the Little Colorado River carves an extremely steep and narrow gorge into the Colorado Plateau, eventually achieving a maximum depth of about . The depth of the canyon is such that groundwater is forced to the surface, forming numerous springs that restore a perennial river flow. It joins the Colorado deep inside the Grand Canyon, miles from any major settlement. The confluence marks the end of the Marble Canyon segment of the Grand Canyon and the beginning of Upper Granite Gorge.

===Discharge===

The Little Colorado River is one of the two major tributaries of the Colorado River in Arizona, the other being the Gila River. Runoff typically peaks twice a year, first in the early spring (February–April) from snow melt and highland rain; and in the summer (July–September) from monsoon storms. The annual runoff is extremely variable with the possibility of no flow occurring due to a weak snow pack or lack of summer rain. Conversely, years such as 1949, 1973, 1979, 1983 and 1993 have seen massive volumes of spring snowmelt while large monsoon runoff has occurred in 1955, 1964, 1984 and 2006. Monthly average flows in the springtime average several hundred cfs and can reach . Only the upper reaches of the river above St. Johns, and the lowermost stretch below Cameron, flow year round; the middle section is basically a huge arroyo that carries water only during the wet seasons.

According to a streamflow gauge near Cameron, before the river enters the Grand Canyon, the river&#x27;s average annual flow was from 1948 to present. The highest annual average was in 1973, and the lowest was in 2000. The river&#x27;s peak flows can be far higher than its average flow, because of quick desert runoff from cloudbursts. At the same gauge, peak flows were recorded from 1923 to 2008, with spotty data from 1924 to 1947. The highest recorded peak was on September 20, 1923, while the lowest was in 1974.

==History==

Human activity in the Little Colorado River watershed dates back to the early Holocene epoch, in the last glacial period. Nomadic hunter-gatherers inhabited the relatively water-rich and diverse upper basin of the Little Colorado for almost 8,000 years before the Navajo, Apache and Hopi tribes populated the area. Many of these people practiced small-scale irrigation in riverside villages, located in sheltered canyons and cliffs that provided defense.

Early Spanish explorers exploring the Grand Canyon area were most likely the first Europeans to see the Little Colorado River. They called it &quot;Colorado Chiquito&quot;, the Little Colorado. Other than fur trappers and mountain men, one of the first organized expeditions into the area of the Little Colorado River was led by Amiel Weeks Whipple in 1853–54 during one of the expeditions to map out a route for a transcontinental railroad. Called The Great Railroad Expeditions, or Pacific Railroad Surveys, Whipple&#x27;s expedition consisted of several teams going roughly along the 35th parallel from Albuquerque to the Pacific, following the Santa Fe Trail route.
The Little Colorado River, also known as the Flax River, and the first Rio Chiquito, is depicted and labelled as such on a map compiled by Lt. Joseph C. Ives and published in the official volumes of those expeditions. Ives would again return to the area in 1858 after navigating a steamboat named the &quot;Explorer&quot; up the Colorado from south of Yuma northwards to Black Canyon, at which point his party went ashore and attempted to go up into the Grand Canyon until the sheer cliffs prevented them from doing so. Leaving the canyon they proceeded overland and someplace in the vicinity of the Grand Falls (also known as the Chocolate Falls) on the Little Colorado, picked up the Whipple trail from four years prior.

The Powell Geographic Expedition, on August 10, 1869, was one of the first American parties to sight the Little Colorado River. Powell and some of his crew explored a segment of the Little Colorado River canyon, although they mainly found it impassable. In diary entries, they recorded its name as &quot;Flax River&quot;, for the flax that makes up much of the river&#x27;s riparian zone—and &quot;Colorado Chiquito&quot;—so, presumably they already knew about the river before they had come on the expedition.

This was in fact an inaccurate depiction of the Little Colorado, as the muddy flow they observed was the result of a rare flash flood. The river is normally a bright blue color caused by dissolved travertine and limestone in the water, similar to Havasu Creek, another major tributary of the Colorado within the Grand Canyon.

In the 1870s, Mormon colonists migrated southwards from Salt Lake City and settled in the lower part of the Little Colorado River valley. Expeditions had been sent into the basin about five years before to determine the qualities of the area. The Mormons founded Joseph City near the confluence with the Puerco River, and four others nearby, although Joseph City is the only one that still exists. Settlers continued traveling into the area through 1876, although many of them had great difficulty in crossing the Little Colorado. Although shallow and slow-flowing, the river flows through soft sand and in some places, even quicksand, creating non-ideal conditions for their wagons.

There were two primary crossings of the Little Colorado—one at the Grand Falls, and one at Black Falls, a smaller waterfall some downstream. It was easier to ford the river at the two waterfalls because at that point, it flows over hard bedrock, making the crossing much easier. The Mormons also made many attempts to construct dams on the river to provide irrigation water—as far upstream as the confluence of the river&#x27;s forks and as far downstream as below Grand Falls—but most of them failed because of the Little Colorado&#x27;s fickle variations in discharge. Finally, they managed to construct one at Joseph City that lasted for 29 years. Despite the continued hardships, the Mormons persisted, successfully established their colonies, and survived in the region for many decades. Later, Hispanics began to move into the Little Colorado River watershed from the Rio Grande area, establishing St. Johns and Concho. American ranchers from New Mexico also began to colonize the region, creating Eagar and Springerville. For many years, Mormons were the primary group living in the watershed until the 1960s, when their independent towns and farms were absorbed into the growing Arizonan economy.

==River modifications==

Because of its isolation, most of the Little Colorado has remained free of human development. However, near its headwaters, the river is dammed twice, first in River Reservoir, then in Lyman Lake, where its water is stored for irrigation. Another reservoir downstream of Springerville, where Mormon colonists dammed the river in 1905 to form Zion Reservoir, is now completely silted in. Many other earthen and masonry dams originally built along the river by the Mormons no longer exist. At very few points is the river confined by levees, with the exception of a floodwall near Holbrook. There are also few bridges for a river of its length.

In one of the worst radioactive spills in the U.S. history, on July 16, 1979, of radioactive water containing uranium tailings breached into the North Fork of the Puerco River from a tailing pond of a uranium mine owned by Kerr-McGee Company and United Nuclear Corporation. Approximately 1,100 tons of uranium mine waste contaminated of land and up to of the Puerco River, traveling into the Little Colorado River as far as the Navajo Nation. Traces of the spill can still be found today.

<text>In mathematics, an integral transform is a type of transform that maps a function from its original function space into another function space via integration, where some of the properties of the original function might be more easily characterized and manipulated than in the original function space. The transformed function can generally be mapped back to the original function space using the &quot;inverse transform&quot;.

==General form==
An integral transform is any transform &quot;formula_1&quot; of the following form:

:formula_2

The input of this transform is a function &quot;formula_3&quot;, and the output is another function &quot;formula_4&quot;. An integral transform is a particular kind of mathematical operator.

There are numerous useful integral transforms. Each is specified by a choice of the function formula_5 of two variables, that is called the kernel or nucleus of the transform.

Some kernels have an associated &quot;inverse kernel&quot; formula_6 which (roughly speaking) yields an inverse transform:

:formula_7

A &quot;symmetric kernel&quot; is one that is unchanged when the two variables are permuted; it is a kernel function &quot;formula_5&quot; such that formula_9. In the theory of integral equations, symmetric kernels correspond to self-adjoint operators.

== Motivation ==

There are many classes of problems that are difficult to solve—or at least quite unwieldy algebraically—in their original representations. An integral transform &quot;maps&quot; an equation from its original &quot;domain&quot; into another domain, in which manipulating and solving the equation may be much easier than in the original domain. The solution can then be mapped back to the original domain with the inverse of the integral transform.

There are many applications of probability that rely on integral transforms, such as &quot;pricing kernel&quot; or stochastic discount factor, or the smoothing of data recovered from robust statistics; see kernel (statistics).

== History ==
The precursor of the transforms were the Fourier series to express functions in finite intervals. Later the Fourier transform was developed to remove the requirement of finite intervals.

Using the Fourier series, just about any practical function of time (the voltage across the terminals of an electronic device for example) can be represented as a sum of sines and cosines, each suitably scaled (multiplied by a constant factor), shifted (advanced or retarded in time) and &quot;squeezed&quot; or &quot;stretched&quot; (increasing or decreasing the frequency). The sines and cosines in the Fourier series are an example of an orthonormal basis.

==Usage example==

As an example of an application of integral transforms, consider the Laplace transform. This is a technique that maps differential or integro-differential equations in the &quot;time&quot; domain into polynomial equations in what is termed the &quot;complex frequency&quot; domain. (Complex frequency is similar to actual, physical frequency but rather more general. Specifically, the imaginary component &quot;ω&quot; of the complex frequency &quot;s&quot; = −&quot;σ&quot; + &quot;iω&quot; corresponds to the usual concept of frequency, &quot;viz.&quot;, the rate at which a sinusoid cycles, whereas the real component &quot;σ&quot; of the complex frequency corresponds to the degree of &quot;damping&quot;, i.e. an exponential decrease of the amplitude.) The equation cast in terms of complex frequency is readily solved in the complex frequency domain (roots of the polynomial equations in the complex frequency domain correspond to eigenvalues in the time domain), leading to a &quot;solution&quot; formulated in the frequency domain. Employing the inverse transform, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the inverse procedure of the original Laplace transform, one obtains a time-domain solution. In this example, polynomials in the complex frequency domain (typically occurring in the denominator) correspond to power series in the time domain, while axial shifts in the complex frequency domain correspond to damping by decaying exponentials in the time domain.

The Laplace transform finds wide application in physics and particularly in electrical engineering, where the characteristic equations that describe the behavior of an electric circuit in the complex frequency domain correspond to linear combinations of exponentially scaled and time-shifted damped sinusoids in the time domain. Other integral transforms find special applicability within other scientific and mathematical disciplines.

Another usage example is the kernel in the path integral:

:formula_10

This states that the total amplitude formula_11 to arrive at formula_12 is the sum (the integral) over all possible values formula_13 of the total amplitude formula_14 to arrive at the point formula_15 multiplied by the amplitude to go from formula_13 to formula_17 i.e. formula_18. It is often referred to as the propagator for a given system. This (physics) kernel is the kernel of the integral transform. However, for each quantum system, there is a different kernel.

==Table of transforms==

In the limits of integration for the inverse transform, &quot;c&quot; is a constant which depends on the nature of the transform function. For example, for the one and two-sided Laplace transform, &quot;c&quot; must be greater than the largest real part of the zeroes of the transform function.

Note that there are alternative notations and conventions for the Fourier transform.

==Different domains==
Here integral transforms are defined for functions on the real numbers, but they can be defined more generally for functions on a group.
* If instead one uses functions on the circle (periodic functions), integration kernels are then biperiodic functions; convolution by functions on the circle yields circular convolution.
* If one uses functions on the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; ( or ), one obtains &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices as integration kernels; convolution corresponds to circulant matrices.

==General theory==
Although the properties of integral transforms vary widely, they have some properties in common. For example, every integral transform is a linear operator, since the integral is a linear operator, and in fact if the kernel is allowed to be a generalized function then all linear operators are integral transforms (a properly formulated version of this statement is the Schwartz kernel theorem).

The general theory of such integral equations is known as Fredholm theory. In this theory, the kernel is understood to be a compact operator acting on a Banach space of functions. Depending on the situation, the kernel is then variously referred to as the Fredholm operator, the nuclear operator or the Fredholm kernel.

<text>John William Cheever (May 27, 1912 – June 18, 1982) was an American short story writer and novelist. He is sometimes called &quot;the Chekhov of the suburbs&quot;. His fiction is mostly set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan; the Westchester suburbs; old New England villages based on various South Shore towns around Quincy, Massachusetts, where he was born; and Italy, especially Rome. His short stories included &quot;The Enormous Radio&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, My Brother&quot;, &quot;The Five-Forty-Eight&quot;, &quot;The Country Husband&quot;, and &quot;The Swimmer&quot;, and he also wrote five novels: &quot;The Wapshot Chronicle&quot; (National Book Award, 1958),
&quot;The Wapshot Scandal&quot; (William Dean Howells Medal, 1965), &quot;Bullet Park&quot; (1969), &quot;Falconer&quot; (1977) and a novella, &quot;Oh What a Paradise It Seems&quot; (1982).

His main themes include the duality of human nature: sometimes dramatized as the disparity between a character&#x27;s decorous social persona and inner corruption, and sometimes as a conflict between two characters (often brothers) who embody the salient aspects of both—light and dark, flesh and spirit. Many of his works also express a nostalgia for a vanishing way of life (as evoked by the mythical St. Botolphs in the &quot;Wapshot&quot; novels), characterized by abiding cultural traditions and a profound sense of community, as opposed to the alienating nomadism of modern suburbia.

A compilation of his short stories, &quot;The Stories of John Cheever&quot;, won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and a National Book Critics Circle Award, and its first paperback edition won a 1981 National Book Award.

On April 27, 1982, six weeks before his death, Cheever was awarded the National Medal for Literature by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His work has been included in the Library of America.

== Early life and education ==

John William Cheever was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, the second child of Frederick Lincoln Cheever and Mary Liley Cheever. His father was a prosperous shoe salesman, and Cheever spent much of his childhood in a large Victorian house, at 123 Winthrop Avenue, in the then-genteel suburb of Wollaston, Massachusetts. In the mid-1920s, however, as the New England shoe and textile industries began their long decline, Frederick Cheever lost most of his money and began to drink heavily. To pay the bills, Mary Cheever opened a gift shop in downtown Quincy—an &quot;abysmal humiliation&quot; for the family, as John saw it. In 1926, Cheever began attending Thayer Academy, a private day school, but he found the atmosphere stifling and performed poorly, and finally transferred to Quincy High in 1928. A year later, he won a short story contest sponsored by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and was invited back to Thayer as a &quot;special student&quot; on academic probation. His grades continued to be poor, however, and, in March 1930, he was either expelled for smoking or (more likely) departed of his own accord when the headmaster delivered an ultimatum to the effect that he must either apply himself or leave. The 18-year-old Cheever wrote a sardonic account of this experience, titled &quot;Expelled&quot;, which was subsequently published in &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

Around this time, Cheever&#x27;s older brother, Fred, forced to withdraw from Dartmouth in 1926 because of the family&#x27;s financial crisis, re-entered Cheever&#x27;s life &quot;when the situation was most painful and critical&quot;, as Cheever later wrote. After the 1932 crash of Kreuger &amp; Toll, in which Frederick Cheever had invested what was left of his money, the Cheever house on Winthrop Avenue was lost to foreclosure. The parents separated, while John and Fred took an apartment together on Beacon Hill, in Boston. In 1933, John wrote to Elizabeth Ames, the director of the Yaddo artist&#x27;s colony in Saratoga Springs, New York: &quot;The idea of leaving the city&quot;, he said, &quot;has never been so distant or desirable.&quot; Ames denied his first application but offered him a place the following year, whereupon Cheever decided to sever his &quot;ungainly attachment&quot; to his brother. Cheever spent the summer of 1934 at Yaddo, which would serve as a second home for much of his life.

== Career ==

=== Early writings ===

For the next few years, Cheever divided his time between Manhattan, Saratoga, Lake George (where he was caretaker of the Yaddo-owned Triuna Island), and Quincy, where he continued to visit his parents, who had reconciled and moved to an apartment at 60 Spear Street. Cheever drove from one place to another in a dilapidated Model A roadster, but had no permanent address. In 1935, Katharine White of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; bought Cheever&#x27;s story &quot;Buffalo&quot; for $45—the first of many that Cheever would publish in the magazine. Maxim Lieber became his literary agent, 1935–1941. In 1938, he began work for the Federal Writers&#x27; Project in Washington, D.C., which he considered an embarrassing boondoggle. As an editor for the &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot;, Cheever was charged with (as he put it) &quot;twisting into order the sentences written by some incredibly lazy bastards.&quot; He quit after less than a year and a few months later he met his future wife, Mary Winternitz, seven years his junior. She was a daughter of Milton Winternitz, dean of Yale Medical School, and granddaughter of Thomas A. Watson, an assistant to Alexander Graham Bell during the invention of the telephone. They married in 1941.

Cheever enlisted as an infantryman in the U.S. Army on May 7, 1942. He was later reassigned to the Signal Corps. His first collection of short stories, &quot;The Way Some People Live&quot;, was published in 1943 to mixed reviews. Cheever himself came to despise the book as &quot;embarrassingly immature&quot;, and for the rest of his life destroyed every copy he could lay his hands on. However, the book may have saved his life after falling into the hands of Major Leonard Spigelgass, an MGM executive and officer in the Signal Corps, who was struck by Cheever&#x27;s &quot;childlike sense of wonder.&quot; Early that summer, Cheever was transferred to the former Paramount studio in Astoria, Queens, New York City, where he commuted via subway from his apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City. Meanwhile, most of his old infantry company was killed on a Normandy beach during the D-Day invasion. Cheever&#x27;s daughter Susan was born on July 31, 1943.

After the war, Cheever and his family moved to an apartment building at 400 East 59th Street, near Sutton Place, Manhattan; almost every morning for the next five years, he would dress in his only suit and take the elevator to a maid&#x27;s room in the basement, where he stripped to his boxer shorts and wrote until lunchtime. In 1946, he accepted a $4,800 advance from Random House to resume work on his novel, &quot;The Holly Tree&quot;, which he had discontinued during the war. &quot;The Enormous Radio&quot; appeared in the May 17, 1947 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;—a Kafkaesque tale about a sinister radio that broadcasts the private conversations of tenants in a New York apartment building. A startling advance on Cheever&#x27;s early, more naturalistic work, the story elicited a fan letter from the magazine&#x27;s irascible editor, Harold Ross: &quot;It will turn out to be a memorable one, or I am a fish.&quot; Cheever&#x27;s son Benjamin was born on May 4, 1948.

=== Mid-career ===

Cheever&#x27;s work became longer and more complex, apparently a protest against the &quot;slice of life&quot; fiction typical of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in those years. An early draft of &quot;The Day the Pig Fell into the Well&quot;—a long story with elaborate Chekhovian nuances, meant to &quot;operate something like a rondo&quot;, as Cheever wrote to his friend and &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor William Maxwell—was completed in 1949, though the magazine did not make space for it until five years later. In 1951, Cheever wrote &quot;Goodbye, My Brother&quot;, after a gloomy summer in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Largely on the strength of these two stories (still in manuscript at the time), Cheever was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. On May 28, 1951, Cheever moved to Beechwood, the suburban estate of Frank A. Vanderlip, a banker, in the Westchester hamlet of Scarborough-on-Hudson, where he rented a small cottage on the edge of the estate. The house, coincidentally, had been occupied before the Cheevers by another suburban chronicler, Richard Yates. In Scarborough, he was a casual volunteer for the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department.

Cheever&#x27;s second collection, &quot;The Enormous Radio&quot;, was published in 1953. Reviews were mostly positive, though Cheever&#x27;s reputation continued to suffer because of his close association with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (considered middlebrow by such influential critics as Dwight Macdonald), and he was particularly pained by the general preference for J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Nine Stories&quot;, published around the same time. Meanwhile, Random House demanded that Cheever either produce a publishable novel or pay back his advance, whereupon Cheever wrote Mike Bessie at Harper &amp; Brothers (&quot;These old bones are up for sale&quot;), who bought him out of his Random House contract. In the summer of 1956, Cheever finished &quot;The Wapshot Chronicle&quot; while vacationing in Friendship, Maine, and received a congratulatory telegram from William Maxwell: &quot;WELL ROARED LION&quot;. With the proceeds from the sale of film rights to &quot;The Housebreaker of Shady Hill&quot;, Cheever and his family spent the following year in Italy, where his son Federico was born on March 9, 1957 (&quot;We wanted to call him Frederick&quot;, Cheever wrote, &quot;but there is of course no K in the alphabet here and I gave up after an hour or two&quot;).

&quot;The Wapshot Scandal&quot; was published in 1964, and received perhaps the best reviews of Cheever&#x27;s career up to that point (amid quibbles about the novel&#x27;s episodic structure). Cheever appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s March 27 issue, this for an appreciative profile, &quot;Ovid in Ossining&quot;. (In 1961, Cheever had moved to a stately, stone-ended Dutch Colonial farmhouse in Ossining, on the east bank of the Hudson.) &quot;The Swimmer&quot; appeared in the July 18, 1964, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Cheever noted with chagrin that the story (one of his best) appeared toward the back of the issue—behind a John Updike story—since, as it happened, Maxwell and other editors at the magazine were a little bewildered by its non-&quot;New Yorkerish&quot; surrealism. In the summer of 1966, a screen adaptation of &quot;The Swimmer&quot;, starring Burt Lancaster, was filmed in Westport, Connecticut. Cheever was a frequent visitor on the set, and made a cameo appearance in the movie.

By then Cheever&#x27;s alcoholism had become severe, exacerbated by torment concerning his bisexuality. Still, he blamed most of his marital woes on his wife, and in 1966 he consulted a psychiatrist, David C. Hays, about her hostility and &quot;needless darkness&quot;. After a session with Mary Cheever, the psychiatrist asked to see the couple jointly; Cheever, heartened, believed his wife&#x27;s difficult behavior would finally be addressed. At the joint session, however, Hays said (as Cheever noted in his journal) that Cheever himself was the problem: &quot;a neurotic man, narcissistic, egocentric, friendless, and so deeply involved in [his] own defensive illusions that [he has] invented a manic-depressive wife.&quot; Cheever soon terminated therapy.

=== Later life and career ===

&quot;Bullet Park&quot; was published in 1969, and received a devastating review from Benjamin DeMott on the front page of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;John Cheever&#x27;s short stories are and will remain lovely birds... But in the gluey atmosphere of &quot;Bullet Park&quot; no birds sing.&quot; Cheever&#x27;s alcoholic depression deepened, and in May he resumed psychiatric treatment (which again proved fruitless). He began an affair with actress Hope Lange in the late 1960s.

On May 12, 1973, Cheever awoke coughing uncontrollably and learned at the hospital that he had almost died from pulmonary edema caused by alcoholism. After a month in the hospital, he returned home vowing never to drink again; however, he resumed drinking in August. Despite his precarious health, he spent the fall semester teaching (and drinking, both with fellow writer-teacher, Raymond Carver) at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, where his students included T. C. Boyle, Allan Gurganus, and Ron Hansen. As his marriage continued to deteriorate, Cheever accepted a professorship at Boston University the following year and moved into a fourth-floor walkup apartment at 71 Bay State Road. Cheever&#x27;s drinking soon became suicidal and, in March 1975, his brother Fred, now virtually indigent, but sober after his own lifelong bout with alcoholism, drove John back to Ossining. On April 9, Cheever was admitted to the Smithers Alcoholic Rehabilitation Unit in New York, where he shared a bedroom and bath with four other men. Driven home by his wife on May 7, Cheever never drank alcohol again.

In March 1977, Cheever appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; with the caption, &quot;A Great American Novel: John Cheever&#x27;s &quot;Falconer.&quot;&quot; The novel was No. 1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for three weeks. &quot;The Stories of John Cheever&quot; appeared in October 1978, and became one of the most successful collections ever, selling 125,000 copies in hardback and winning universal acclaim.

Cheever was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contribution to the arts by the MacDowell Colony in 1979.

== Personal life ==
Cheever&#x27;s marriage was damaged by his unfaithfulness. He had relationships with both men and women, including a short relationship with composer Ned Rorem and an affair with actress Hope Lange. Cheever&#x27;s longest affair was with a student of his, Max Zimmer, who lived in the Cheever family home. Cheever&#x27;s daughter, Susan, described her parents&#x27; marriage as &quot;European&quot;, saying: &quot;they were people who felt their feelings weren&#x27;t necessarily a reason to shatter a family. They certainly hurt each other plenty but they didn&#x27;t necessarily see that as a reason for divorce.&quot;

== Illness and death ==

In the summer of 1981, a tumor was discovered in Cheever&#x27;s right lung, and, in late November, he returned to the hospital and learned that the cancer had spread to his femur, pelvis, and bladder. His last novel, &quot;Oh What a Paradise It Seems,&quot; was published in March 1982. On April 27, he received the National Medal for Literature at Carnegie Hall, where colleagues were shocked by his ravaged appearance after months of cancer therapy. &quot;A page of good prose&quot;, he declared in his remarks, &quot;remains invincible.&quot; John Updike wrote that &quot;All the literary acolytes assembled there fell quite silent, astonished by such faith.&quot;

When Cheever died on June 18, 1982, flags in Ossining were lowered to half staff for ten days. He is buried at First Parish Cemetery, Norwell, Massachusetts.

=== Posthumous ===
In 1987, Cheever&#x27;s widow, Mary, signed a contract with a small publisher, Academy Chicago Publishers, for the right to publish Cheever&#x27;s uncollected short stories. The contract led to a long legal battle, eventually resulting in &quot;Thirteen Uncollected Stories by John Cheever&quot;, published in 1994 by Academy Chicago.

Two of Cheever&#x27;s children, Susan and Benjamin, became writers. Susan&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; (1984), revealed Cheever&#x27;s sexual relationships with both women and men, which was confirmed by his posthumously published letters and journals. This was parodied to comedic effect in a 1992 episode of the TV sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, when the character Susan discovers explicit love letters from Cheever to her father.

After Blake Bailey published his biography of Richard Yates, &quot;A Tragic Honesty&quot; (2003), Cheever&#x27;s son Ben suggested Bailey write an authoritative biography of Cheever. It was published by Knopf on March 10, 2009, and won that year&#x27;s National Book Critics Circle Award in Biography and the Francis Parkman Prize, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer and James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

Also in 2009, Cheever was featured in &quot;Soul of a People: Writing America&#x27;s Story&quot;, a 90-minute documentary about the WPA Writers&#x27; Project. His life during the 1930s is also highlighted in the companion book, &quot;Soul of a People: The WPA Writers&#x27; Project Uncovers Depression America&quot;.

<doc id="430921" wikidata="Q933832" url="?curid=430921" title="Kill Van Kull">
<text>The Kill Van Kull is a tidal strait between Staten Island, New York, and Bayonne, New Jersey, in the United States. It is approximately long and wide and connects Newark Bay with Upper New York Bay. The Robbins Reef Light is at the eastern end of the Kill, and Bergen Point marks its western end. It is spanned by the Bayonne Bridge and is one of the most heavily traveled waterways in the Port of New York and New Jersey.

Historically, it has been one of the most important channels for the commerce of the region, providing a passage for marine traffic between Upper New York Bay and the industrial towns of northeastern New Jersey. During the colonial era, it played a significant role in travel between New York and the southern colonies, with passengers changing from ferries to coaches at Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth).

Since the final third of the 20th century, it has provided the principal access for oceangoing container ships to Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the busiest port facility in the eastern United States, and Howland Hook Marine Terminal. The strait has required continued dredging and deepening to accommodate the passage of ever-larger ships. In many areas, the sandy bottom was excavated down to rock and required blasting. The Bayonne Bridge&#x27;s deck was raised in 2017 so that New Panamax ships could travel the Kill Van Kull.

Collins Park in Bayonne is situated along the northern shore.

==Etymology==
Kill Van Kull translates as &quot;channel of the ridge&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;. Nearby is the Arthur Kill, the name of which is an Anglicization of the Dutch &quot;achter kill&quot; meaning &quot;back channel&quot;, referring to its location &quot;behind&quot; Staten Island.

The name &quot;Kill Van Kull&quot; originated during the early 17th century, during the Dutch colonial era, when the region was part of New Netherland. Places were named by early explorers and settlers in reference to their shape, topography, or other geographic qualities. The area around Newark Bay was termed Achter Col. The bay lies behind Bergen Hill, the ridge of the Hudson Palisades which begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between it and the Upper New York Bay. Behind or &quot;achter&quot; the ridge was a &quot;col&quot; or &quot;mountain pass&quot; to the interior. 

&quot;Kill&quot; comes from the Middle Dutch word &quot;kille&quot; meaning creek. Compare Dordtse Kil in the Netherlands. The bay was known as Cull Bay during the British colonial era.

<doc id="430925" wikidata="Q77166" url="?curid=430925" title="Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst">
<text>Chlodwig Carl Viktor, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, Prince of Ratibor and Corvey () (31 March 18196 July 1901), usually referred to as the Prince of Hohenlohe, was a German statesman, who served as the imperial chancellor of the German Empire and minister-president of Prussia from 1894 to 1900. Prior to his appointment as Chancellor, he had served in a number of other positions, including as minister-president of Bavaria (1866–1870), German Ambassador to Paris (1873–1880), Foreign Secretary (1880) and Imperial Lieutenant of Alsace-Lorraine (1885–1894). He was regarded as one of the most prominent liberal politicians of his time in Germany.

==Biography==
Chlodwig was born at Rotenburg an der Fulda, in Hesse, a member of the princely House of Hohenlohe. His father, Prince Franz Joseph (1787–1841), was a Catholic; his mother, Princess Konstanze of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a Lutheran. In accordance with the compromise customary at the time, Chlodwig and his brothers were brought up in the Roman Catholic religion of their father.

=== Early career ===
As the younger son of a cadet line of his house, it was necessary for Chlodwig to follow a profession. For a while he thought of obtaining a commission in the British army through the influence of his aunt, Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, half-sister to Queen Victoria. Instead, however, he decided to enter the Prussian diplomatic service.

Chlodwig&#x27;s application to be excused the preliminary steps, which involved several years&#x27; work in subordinate positions in the Prussian civil service, was refused by King Frederick William IV. As auscultator in the courts at Koblenz he acquired a taste for jurisprudence. He became a referendar in September 1843, and after some months of travel in France, Switzerland and Italy he went to Potsdam as a civil servant 13 May 1844.

These early years were invaluable - not only did it provide him experience of practical affairs, it also afforded him an insight into the strength and weakness of the Prussian system. The immediate result was to confirm his Liberalism. The Prussian principle of propagating enlightenment with a stick did not appeal to him; he recognized the confusion and want of clear ideas in the highest circles, the tendency to make agreement with the views of the government the test of loyalty to the state; and he noted in his journal (25 June 1844) four years before the revolution of 1848, &quot;a slight cause and we shall have a rising.&quot; &quot;The free press,&quot; he notes on another occasion, &quot;is a necessity, progress the condition of the existence of a state.&quot; If he was an ardent advocate of German unity, and saw in Prussia the instrument for its attainment, he was throughout opposed to the &quot;Prussification&quot; of Germany.

=== Succession to family titles and estates ===
Chlodwig was the second of six sons. In 1834 his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law Landgrave Viktor Amadeus of Hesse-Rotenburg died, leaving his estates to his nephews. It was not until 1840 that it was determined how to divide these estates. On 15 October 1840 Chlodwig&#x27;s older brother, Viktor Moritz Karl zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, 1st Fürst von Corvey (10 February 1818 – 30 January 1893), renounced his rights as first-born son to the Principality of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, and was made Duke of Ratibor and Prince of Corvey by King Frederick William IV of Prussia; at the same time Chlodwig received the additional title of Prince of Ratibor and Corvey. He also received the lordship of Treffurt in the Prussian governmental district of Erfurt.

On 14 January 1841, Chlodwig&#x27;s father, Fürst Franz Joseph (1787–1841), died. As second son he ought to have succeeded as Prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;) of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, but instead he renounced his rights to his third brother Philipp Ernst, (24 May 1820 – 3 May 1845), with the stipulation that they would revert to him in case of his brother&#x27;s death. On 3 May 1845 Philipp Ernst died, and Chlodwig succeeded as seventh Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst. As such he was an hereditary member of the Upper House of the Bavarian Reichsrat. Such a position was incompatible with his political career in Prussia. On 18 April 1846, he took his seat as a member of the Bavarian Reichsrat, and the following 26 June he received his formal discharge from the Prussian service.

Chlodwig&#x27;s political life for the next eighteen years was generally uneventful. During the Revolution of 1848 his sympathies were with the Liberal idea of a united Germany, and he compromised his chances of favor from King Maximilian II of Bavaria by accepting the task of announcing to the courts of Rome, Florence and Athens the accession to office of the Archduke Johann of Austria as regent of Germany.

In general, this period of Chlodwig&#x27;s life was occupied in the management of his estates, in the sessions of the Bavarian Reichsrat and in travels. In 1856 he visited Rome, during which he noted the influence of the Jesuits. In 1859 he was studying the political situation at Berlin, and in the same year he paid a visit to England. The marriage of his cadet brother, Prince Konstantin of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (8 September 1828 – Vienna, Austria, 14 February 1896), to Princess Marie of Sayn-Wittgenstein (18 February 1837 – 21 January 1920), on 15 October 1859 at Weimar, Germany led also to frequent visits to Vienna. Thus Chlodwig was brought into close touch with all the most notable people in Europe, including Catholic leaders of the Austrian Empire.

At the same time, during this period (1850–1866) he was endeavouring to get into relations with the Bavarian government, with a view to taking a more active part in affairs. Towards the German question his attitude at this time was tentative. He had little hope of a practical realization of a united Germany, and inclined towards the tripartite divisions under Austria, Prussia and Bavaria (the so-called &quot;Trias-Lösung&quot;). He attended the Fürstentag at Frankfurt in 1863; further, in the Schleswig-Holstein question, he was a supporter of the prince of Augustenburg. It was at this time that, at the request of Queen Victoria, he began to send her regular reports on the political condition of Germany.

His portrait was painted by Philip de László.

=== Minister-President of Bavaria ===
After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Chlodwig argued in the Bavarian Reichsrat for a closer union with mainly Protestant Prussia. King Ludwig II of Bavaria was opposed to any dilution of his power, but was eventually brought around, after Bismarck secretly bequeathed him a large sum from the &quot;Welfen-Funds&quot; (a large part of the fortune of the royal House of Hanover used after the annexation of Hanover by Prussia to fight Hannoverian loyalists) to pay off his large debts.

On 31 December 1866, Chlodwig was appointed minister of the royal house and of foreign affairs and president of the council of ministers. According to Chlodwig&#x27;s son Alexander (&quot;Denkwurdigkeiten&quot;, i. 178, 211) Chlodwig&#x27;s appointment as Minister-President occurred at the instigation of the composer Richard Wagner.

As head of the Bavarian government Chlodwig&#x27;s principal task was to discover some basis for an effective union of the South German states with the North German Confederation. During the three critical years of his tenure of office he was, next to Bismarck, the most important statesman in Germany. He carried out the reorganization of the Bavarian army on the Prussian model, brought about the military union of the southern states, and took a leading share in the creation of the customs parliament (Zollparlament), of which on 28 April 1868 he was elected a vice-president.

During the agitation that arose in connection with the summoning of the First Vatican Council Chlodwig took up an attitude of strong opposition to the ultramontane position. In common with his brothers, the Duke of Ratibor and Cardinal Prince Gustav Adolf zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, he believed that the policy of Pope Pius IX of setting the Church in opposition to the modern state would prove ruinous to both, and that the definition of the dogma of papal infallibility would irrevocably commit the Church to the pronouncements of the Syllabus of Errors (1864).

This view he embodied into a circular note to the Roman Catholic powers (9 April 1869), drawn up by Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger, inviting them to exercise the right of sending ambassadors to the council and to combine to prevent the definition of the dogma. The greater powers, however, were for one reason or another unwilling to intervene, and the only practical outcome of Chlodwig&#x27;s action was that in Bavaria the powerful ultramontane party combined against him with the Bavarian patriots who accused him of bartering away Bavarian independence to Prussia. The combination was too strong for him; a bill which he brought in for curbing the influence of the Church over education was defeated, the elections of 1869 went against him, and in spite of the continued support of the king he was forced to resign (7 March 1870).

=== Continuing influence ===
Though out of office, his personal influence continued to be very great both at Munich and Berlin, in no small part due to the favorable terms of the treaty of the North German Confederation with Bavaria, which embodied his views, and with its acceptance by the Bavarian parliament. Elected a member of the German Reichstag, he was chosen as one of its vice-presidents on 23 March 1871. He was instrumental in founding the new groups which took the name of the Imperial Liberal Party (Liberale Reichspartei), the objects of which were to support the new empire, to secure its internal development on Liberal lines, and to oppose the Catholic Centre.

Like his brother the Duke of Ratibor, Chlodwig was from the first a strenuous supporter of Bismarck&#x27;s anti-papal policy (the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;), the main lines of which (prohibition of the Society of Jesus, etc.) he himself suggested. Although he sympathized with the motives of the Old Catholics, he did not join them, believing that the only hope for a reform of the church lay with those who desired it remaining within the church. In 1872 Bismarck proposed appointing Chlodwig&#x27;s younger brother, Cardinal Prince Gustav Adolf von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, as Prussian envoy to the Holy See, but Pope Pius IX refused to receive him in this capacity.

In 1873, Bismarck chose Chlodwig to succeed Count Harry von Arnim as German ambassador in Paris, where he remained for seven years. In 1878, he attended the Congress of Berlin as third German representative. In 1880, after the death of the German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Bernhard Ernst von Bülow (20 October 1879), Chlodwig was called to Berlin as temporary head of the Foreign Office and representative of Bismarck during his absence through illness.

In 1885, Chlodwig was chosen to succeed Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel as governor of Alsace-Lorraine, incorporated after the 1870 war against France. In this capacity, he had to carry out the coercive measures introduced by Bismarck in 1887 and 1888, though he largely disapproved of them; his conciliatory disposition, however, did much to reconcile the Alsace-Lorrainers to German rule.

=== Chancellor of Germany ===

Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst remained at Strasbourg until October 1894, when, at the urgent request of the Emperor William II, he consented, in spite of his advanced years, to accept the chancellorship as Caprivi&#x27;s successor. The Kaiser&#x27;s &quot;great friend&quot; Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg wanted his cousin Botho zu Eulenburg to be Caprivi&#x27;s replacement, but Friedrich von Holstein, the head of the political department of the German Foreign Office, was able to persuade William II not to appoint Eulenburg as chancellor. However, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg then managed to convince the emperor to appoint the aged Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, who was the German ambassador to France in 1881 when Eulenburg served in the Paris embassy, as the new chancellor. During this time, Eulenburg repeatedly advised Wilhelm that the best man to be chancellor was Bernhard von Bülow, whom Eulenburg painted in the most glowing terms; he wrote in February 1895 to Wilhelm saying that &quot;Bernhard is the most valuable servant Your Imperial Majesty possesses, the predestined &quot;Reich&quot; Chancellor of the future&quot;.

The events of Hohenlohe&#x27;s chancellorship belong to the general history of Germany; as regards the inner history of this time the editor of his memoirs has suppressed the greater part of the detailed comments which the prince left behind him. In general, during his term of office, the personality of the chancellor was less conspicuous in public affairs than in the case of either of his predecessors. His appearances in the Prussian and German parliaments were rare, and great independence was left to the secretaries of state.

Chlodwig von Hohenlohe appointed the Foreign Secretary Adolf Marschall von Bieberstein as Prussian Minister of State. He served also as a support in the Prussian cabinet and as his mouthpiece in the Reichstag. Bieberstein was increasingly involved in disputes with William II, who aspired to have a greater personal influence on foreign policy. He was also opposed by the Agrarians because he advocated the reduction of corn duties. In 1897, he was dismissed from both his offices and replaced by Bernhard von Bülow. In the same year William II initiated numerous reshuffles. Among them was the appointment of Alfred von Tirpitz as head of the German Imperial Naval Office. In sum, the imperial personnel policy meant a de facto disempowerment of Chlodwig von Hohenlohe. He was no longer able to halt the transition to an increasingly imperialist German world politics and the naval armaments. The rapprochement with Russia and the deterioration of relations with Great Britain (Kruger telegram in 1896, Samoan crisis in 1899) ran past him, same as the response to the Boxer Rebellion.

Only cautiously, Chlodwig von Hohenlohe ventured an at least internal opposition to the imperial intervention in the affairs of state. In particular he initiated a reform of the Prussian Military Law (1898) and the Law on Associations (1899). During his tenure also the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch was adopted (1896). Chlodwig resigned the chancellorship on 17 October 1900 and was succeeded by Bernhard von Bülow.

=== Death ===
Chlodwig died on 6 July 1901 at Bad Ragaz aged 82.

=== Marriage and family ===
On 16 February 1847 at Rödelheim Chlodwig married Princess Marie of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn (Saint Petersburg, 16 February 1829 – Berlin, 11 December 1897), daughter of Ludwig Adolf Friedrich, 2nd Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn (the son of Russian field marshal Ludwig Adolf Peter, 1st Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg-Ludwigsburg) and his first wife Princess Caroline (Stephanie) Radziwill. Marie was the heiress to vast estates in Imperial Russia. This led to two prolonged visits to Verkiai, Lithuania from 1851 to 1853 and again in 1860 in connection with the management of these properties.

Chlodwig and Marie had six children:
* Elisabeth Constanze Leonille Stephanie (Schillingsfürst, 30 November 1847 – Alt-Aussee, 26 October 1915)
* Stephanie Marie Antonie (Schillingsfürst, 6 July 1851 – Munich, 18 March 1882); married (Schillingsfürst, 12 April 1871) Count Arthur von Schönborn-Wiesentheid (Würzburg, 30 January 1846 – Wiesentheid, 29 September 1915)

<text>Anna Thilda May &quot;May&quot; Swenson (May 28, 1913 – December 4, 1989) was an American poet and playwright. Harold Bloom considered her one of the most important and original poets of the 20th century.

Born to Margaret and Dan Arthur Swenson, she was the eldest of 10 children in a Mormon household where Swedish was spoken regularly and English was a second language. Although her conservative family struggled to accept that she was a lesbian, they remained close throughout her life. Much of her later poetry was devoted to children (e.g. the 1970 collection &quot;Iconographs&quot;). She also translated the work of contemporary Swedish poets, including the selected poems of Nobel laureate Tomas Tranströmer.

== Personal life ==

Swenson attended Utah State University in Logan, Utah, graduating in 1934 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. She taught poetry as poet-in-residence at Bryn Mawr College, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of California, Riverside, Purdue University, and Utah State University. From 1959 to 1966 she worked as a manuscript reviewer at New Directions Publishing. Swenson left New Directions Press in 1966 in an effort to focus on her writing. She served as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1980 until her death in 1989. She is buried in the Logan City Cemetery, and her grave is marked by a granite bench on which is etched some of her poetry. For the last 20 years of her life, she lived in Sea Cliff, New York.

In 1936, Swenson worked as an editor and ghostwriter for a man called &quot;Plat&quot;, who became her &quot;boyfriend&quot;. &quot;I think I should like to have a son by Plat&quot;, she wrote in her diary, &quot;but I would not like to be married to any man, but only be myself.&quot;

Her poems were published in &quot;Antaeus&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Carleton Miscellany&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Parnassus&quot;, and &quot;Poetry&quot;. Her poem &quot;Question&quot; was also published in Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s book &quot;The Host&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==

Swenson received much recognition for her work, including:
*American Introductions Prize in 1955 
*William Rose Benet Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1959
*Longview Foundation Award in 1959
*National Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1960
*Brandeis University Creative Arts Award in 1967
*Lucy Martin Donnelly Award of Bryn Mawr College in 1968
*Shelley Poetry Award in 1968
*Guggenheim fellowship in 1959
*Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship in 1960
*Ford Foundation grant in 1964
*Bollingen Prize for poetry in 1981
*MacArthur Fellowship in 1987

==Style, imagery, and eroticism==
Swenson created poems in &quot;iconograph&quot; style, first published in her 1970 book &quot;Iconographs&quot;, in which she shaped lines of her poetry to create images relating to the poem&#x27;s content. Her work &quot;The Lowering&quot;, for instance, a memorial poem for Robert F. Kennedy, explored Kennedy&#x27;s military funeral, with lines arranged in the shape of a folded flag. Swenson is known for her heavy use of natural imagery, mixed with religious and philosophical themes. Her poem &quot;By Morning&quot;, which was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, compares a snowfall to the biblical fall of manna. Swenson&#x27;s sense of imagery also lends itself to erotic poems, as she describes human bodies, breasts, limbs, and the &quot;pelvic heave of mountains&quot;. Author Jean Gould called Swenson&#x27;s work &quot;sensual as well as sexual.&quot;

==Legacy==

Washington University in St. Louis houses most of Swenson&#x27;s documents and original manuscripts. This is the primary location for all scholarly materials on Swenson.

Utah State University also has two collections of her work, and an addendum in their Special Collections and Archives. The University has created the &quot;May Swenson Project.&quot; Supported by students and teachers, it has publicized Swenson&#x27;s work at USU, as well as her influence across the nation. In her name, USU has dedicated a May Swenson room in the English Department and another in the USU Merrill-Cazier Library. Funds are being sought to establish an endowed chair in Swenson&#x27;s name.

The May Swenson Poetry Award, sponsored by Utah State University Press, is a competitive prize granted annually to an outstanding collection of poetry in English. Open to published and unpublished writers, with no limitation on subject, the competition honors May Swenson as one of America&#x27;s most vital and provocative poets of the twentieth century. Judges for the competition have included Mary Oliver, Maxine Kumin, John Hollander, Mark Doty, Alice Quinn, Harold Bloom, Garrison Keillor, Edward Field and others from the first tier of American letters.

<doc id="430928" wikidata="Q1126563" url="?curid=430928" title="Order of St. Andrew">
<text>The Order of Saint Andrew the Apostle the First-Called () is the highest order conferred by both the Russian Imperial Family (as an order of chivalry) and by the Russian Federation (as a state order). Established as the first and highest order of chivalry of the Russian Tsardom and the Russian Empire in 1698, it was removed from the honours system under the USSR before being re-established as the top Russian civil and military order in 1998.

== Russian Empire ==
===Origins===
The Order was established in 1698 by Tsar Peter the Great, in honour of Saint Andrew, the first apostle of Jesus and patron saint of Russia. It was bestowed in a single class and was only awarded for the most outstanding civilian or military merit.

Peter learned of the practice of bestowing awards from his travels in the West during the Great Embassy. In the past, service to the Russian state was rewarded with money or large estates. He witnessed first hand the awards ceremonies for England&#x27;s Order of the Garter and Austria&#x27;s Order of the Golden Fleece and noticed the loyalty and pride of the awardees. It also saved the state land and money.

Count Fyodor Golovin was the first Knight of the order. Until the Russian Revolution of 1917, just over one thousand awards had been made. During the monarchy, Knights of the Order of St. Andrew also automatically were granted hereditary nobility and received the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Order of the White Eagle, the Order of Saint Anna and the Order St. Stanislaus Knight Grand Cross. Moreover, recipients of lower ranks were automatically promoted to the rank of lieutenant general or vice admiral. The Order of Saint Andrew continues to be awarded by the Russian Imperial House in exile, with most recent investitures having been conferred in 2021. The first post-revolutionary presentation was to Prince Georgy Konstantinovich of Russia on attaining his dynastic majority in April 1923.

Due to a of the order, the French phrase &quot;Cordon Bleu&quot;, initially associated with Order of the Holy Spirit, also referred to knights St Andrew&#x27;s order.

===Insignia===
The insignia of the order consisted of: 

* Badge: an enameled crowned black double-headed eagle bearing a blue St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross (saltire) with St. Andrew crucified upon it; on the arms of the saltire were the Latin letters &#x27;SAPR&#x27; (&#x27;St. Andrew, Patron of Russia&#x27;). It was worn on a pale blue sash over the right shoulder, or on special occasions on an elaborate &#x27;collar&#x27; (chain).
* Star: eight-pointed silver star bearing a miniature of the badge on a golden background at the center, surrounded by the motto &quot;For Faith and Loyalty&quot; (Russian: &quot;Za Veru i Vernost&quot;&#x27;) on a blue ring. It was worn on the left chest.

The insignia of the order could be awarded &quot;with diamonds&quot; as a special distinction. Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg was the chapter church of this order of chivalry.

== Russian Federation ==
An order with the same name but with different insignia and statutes was first unofficially re-established by the Orthodox Church of Russia on December 27, 1988. The order was officially re-instated as the highest Russian civilian and military award by Presidential Decree No.757 on June 1, 1998. The Order&#x27;s award criteria were modified by Presidential Decree 1099 of September 7, 2010.

=== Statute of the Order ===
The Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-Called is used to award prominent statesmen and public figures, eminent representatives of science, culture, the arts and various industries for exceptional services, for promoting the prosperity, grandeur and glory of Russia.

The Order may also be awarded to foreign heads of states for outstanding service to the Russian Federation.

=== Insignia ===
The design of the insignia of the modern Order of St. Andrew has changed very little from the imperial design. It consists of:

* a badge (double-headed eagle) attached to a chain (called a &quot;collar&quot;) worn around the neck for very special circumstances, or more commonly on a 100 mm-wide blue sash worn over the right shoulder
* a star worn on the left breast

The colour of the sash differs from the colour of the Imperial era, and resembles the shade of the sash of the British Order of the Garter. Members of the military division of the Order have crossed swords added below the crown above the two eagles&#x27; heads. On the reverse of the eagle on a white ribbon the motto of the Order appears inscribed in gold letters: «За веру и верность» (&quot;For faith and loyalty&quot;).

<text>The Central Lancashire Cricket League (CLCL) was a fifteen team cricket league, traditionally based in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was then based in Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. The league ran competitions at First Team, Second Team, Third Team, Under 18, Under 15, Under 13 and Under 11 levels.

The league was due to expand to a sixteen club format in 2005. Monton &amp; Weaste were awarded the extra place ahead of Bamford Fieldhouse, Saddleworth, Elton, Walshaw, Didsbury and Bury. However, Stand left the league before the 2005 season and their replacement, Clifton did not join until 2006. That latter year also saw the introduction of a Twenty20 competition in the league, which was first won by Norden.

2015 was the final season for the league. Many of its clubs opting to join the new Greater Manchester Cricket League which started in 2016, CLCL merged with the Saddleworth League to form the Pennine League. The Pennine League failed after only two seasons, blamed by the league secretary on the expansion plans of the Lancashire League It was announced early in the 2017 season that Norden, Walsden, Littleborough, Rochdale and Middleton would all move to the Lancashire League.

<doc id="430939" wikidata="Q2617172" url="?curid=430939" title="Newark Bay">
<text>Newark Bay is a tidal bay at the confluence of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers in northeastern New Jersey. It is home to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the largest container shipping facility in Port of New York and New Jersey, the second busiest in the United States. An estuary, it is periodically dredged to accommodate seafaring ships.

==Geography==

Newark Bay is rectangular, approximately long, varying in width from . It is enclosed on the west by the cities of Newark and Elizabeth, and on the east by Jersey City and Bayonne. At the south is Staten Island, New York and at the north Kearny Point and Droyer&#x27;s Point mark the mouth of the Hackensack. Shooters Island is a bird sanctuary where the borders of Staten Island, Bayonne and Elizabeth meet at one point. The southern tip of Bergen Neck, known as Bergen Point, juts into the bay and lent its name to the former Bergen Point Lighthouse. Built offshore in 1849 it was demolished and replaced with a skeletal tower in the mid 20th century.

The Atlantic Ocean at Sandy Hook and Rockaway Point is approximately away and reached by tidal straits dredged to maintain shipping lanes. Newark Bay is connected to Upper New York Bay by the Kill Van Kull and to Raritan Bay by the Arthur Kill. The names of the channels reflect the period of Dutch colonialization. The area around the bay was called Achter Kol, which translates as &quot;behind or beyond the ridge&quot; and refers to Bergen Hill. The emergence of the Hudson Palisades begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between the bay and the Hudson River. &quot;Kill&quot; in Dutch means stream or channel. During the British colonial era the bay was known as &quot;Cull bay&quot;.
Kill van Kull literally translates as &quot;channel from the ridge&quot;. Arthur Kill is an anglicization of &quot;achter kill&quot; meaning &quot;back channel&quot;, which would speak to its location behind Staten Island.

Many of the maritime and distribution facilities along the bay are part of Foreign Trade Zone 49.

==Bridges==
The bay is spanned by the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge which carries the Newark Bay Extension (Interstate 78) of the New Jersey Turnpike. The Upper Bay Bridge is a vertical-lift bridge north of the Casciano that is now used by CSX Transportation for freight shipment, including the notable Juice Train. Central Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Newark Bay Bridge crossed the bay from 1864 to connect its Communipaw Terminal. Last used in 1978, it was determined to be a hazard to maritime navigation and demolished in the 1980s.

==Shoreline==
===Elizabethport to the Ironbound===

Elizabeth is the site of the first English speaking European settlement (1675) in New Jersey, its port at the southern end of the bay a major maritime hub during the colonial era. Jersey Gardens, an outlet mall, has been located north of Elizabethport since 1999. There are plans to construct a mixed used community adjacent to it along the bay.

The western edge of Newark Bay was originally shallow tidal wetlands covering approximately . In the 1910s, the city of Newark began excavating an angled shipping channel in the northeastern quadrant of the wetland which formed the basis of Port Newark. Work on the channel and terminal facilities on its north side accelerated during World War I, when the federal government took control of Port Newark. During the war there were close to 25,000 troops stationed at the Newark Bay Shipyard.

The city decided to expand the port at the end of the war. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was formed in 1921 and the Newark Bay Channels were authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Acts in 1922. Shipping operations languished after the war, and in 1927, the City of Newark started construction of Newark Liberty International Airport on the northwest quadrant of the wetlands which lay between Port Newark and the edge of the developed city. Port Authority took over the operations of Port Newark and the Newark Airport in 1948 and began modernizing and expanding both facilities southward. In 1958, the Port Authority dredged another shipping channel which straightened the course of Bound Brook, the tidal inlet forming the boundary between Newark and Elizabeth. Dredged materials was used to create new upland south of the new Elizabeth Channel, where the Port Authority constructed the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The first shipping facility to open upon the Elizabeth Channel was the new Sea-Land Container Terminal, which was the prototype for virtually every other container terminal constructed thereafter.

The Ironbound is an industrial area along the bay which becomes residential farther inland near Downtown Newark.

===Kearny Point===
The Newark and New York Railroad, controlled by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, first built the Newark and New York Branch across the rivers and tip of New Barbadoes Neck in 1869. One bridge was taken out of service in 1946 after a ship collided into it. Passenger service on the other bridge, the PD Draw, was discontinued in 1967. The Kearny Point peninsula is site of the River Terminal, a massive distribution facility. It comprises the former Western Electric Kearny Works and Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, the shipyards of which operated from 1917 to 1949, and played a prominent role in both World War I and World War II.

===Bergen Point to Droyer&#x27;s Point===

While there was some maritime development on the eastern banks of the bay closer Bergen Point most of the eastern shore abuts residential and recreational areas. The Hackensack RiverWalk is a partially completed linear park greenway intended to link the string of parks along its banks and that of the Hackensack River from the Bayonne Bridge to the Hackensack Meadowlands in Secaucus and North Bergen. In Bayonne, much of the bay has not seen bulkhead development, and hence has a natural shoreline. The city&#x27;s largest parks are its shores. At Droyer&#x27;s Point recreational and residential development have included a promenade.

===Howland Hook===
The Howland Hook Marine Terminal is a container port facility located at the northwestern corner of Staten Island at the entrance to the Arthur Kill. Nearby is Port Ivory, named for the Ivory Soap plant once located there. To the east is the residential neighborhood of Mariners Harbor which overlooks the bay. In the first half of the 20th century, Bethlehem Steel maintained a plant which built military transports during World War I and World War II. Currently, tugboat companies and number of smaller dry docks operate along the shore.

==Pollution and marine life==


The bay is notoriously polluted, and it is now a Superfund site. &quot;One blue crab in Newark Bay has enough dioxin to give somebody cancer,&quot; said David Pringle, spokesman for Clean Water Action.

Both the tributaries, particularly the Passaic River, have sections which are lined with heavy industry. Some industrial facilities discharged wastes into the tributaries during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, prior to passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act. High levels of PCBs and dioxin have been detected in the bay. It also has high levels of mercury, copper and other toxic chemicals.

While illegal discharges of chemical waste have been stopped, crabbing is illegal and fishing is limited due to chemicals that remain in the sediment.

Pronounced endocrine disruption and reproductive effects have been reported in Newark Bay Mummichog, often used as a sentinel and bioindicator species. Reproductive effects reported are primarily due to a chemical inhibition of vitellogenesis and oogenesis, which are highly conserved processes for oviparous (egg-laying) animals. Killifish within Newark Bay have also been reported to chemically adapt (desensitize) to aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediated pollutants (i.e. dioxins). Killifish within Newark Bay have emerged as a popular tool for studying population effects of historical and emerging chemicals of concern due to their chronic exposure to complex mixtures of common contaminants, and subsequent effects due to living within a polluted environment.

===2008 Liberian freighter collision ===
In January 2008, a 117 ft. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company dredge in Newark Bay was struck by a 669-ft Liberian-flagged orange juice freighter named the &quot;Orange Sun&quot;. Newark Bay had to be closed for five hours by the U.S. Coast Guard until damages to the GLD&amp;D dredge were mitigated. The dredge had begun to take on water and a diving crew was sent in order to make repairs. In December 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report that blamed the &quot;Orange Sun&quot; for the accident. The &quot;Orange Sun&quot;″s master had not informed the captain or crew about the ship&#x27;s tendency to deviate from its course.

<text>Port Lincoln is a city on the Lower Eyre Peninsula in the Australian state of South Australia. Known as Galinyala by the traditional owners, the Barngarla people, it is situated on the shore of Boston Bay, which opens eastward into Spencer Gulf. It is the largest city in the West Coast region, and is located approximately from the state&#x27;s capital city of Adelaide ( by road).

In June 2019 Port Lincoln had an estimated population of 26,418, having grown at an average annual rate of 0.55% year-on-year over the preceding five years. The city is reputed to have the most millionaires per capita in Australia, as well as claiming to be Australia&#x27;s &quot;Seafood Capital&quot;.

==History and name==

The Eyre Peninsula has been home to Aboriginal people for over 40 thousand years, with the Barngarla (eastern Eyre, including Port Lincoln), Nauo (south western Eyre), Wirangu (north western Eyre) and Mirning (far western Eyre) being the predominant original cultural groups present at the time of the arrival of Europeans.

The Barngala people have been acknowledged as the traditional owners, and their name for Port Lincoln is Galinyala, which in the Barngarla language means &quot;place of sweet water&quot;.

Matthew Flinders was the first European to reach Port Lincoln under his commission by the British Admiralty to chart Australia&#x27;s unexplored coastline. On 25 February 1802, Flinders sailed his exploration vessel HMS &quot;Investigator&quot; into the harbour, which he later named Port Lincoln after the city of Lincoln in his native county of Lincolnshire in England. A couple of months later on 19 April, Nicolas Baudin entered the same port and named it Port Champagny.

Sealers had visited the area around 1828 and the mainly French whaling ships were fishing the local bays and island regions by the 1820s and up to the 1840s. In 1836 Governor Sir John Hindmarsh, the first Governor of South Australia, gave instructions to Colonel William Light to find a capital for the &quot;New British Province of South Australia&quot;. With boatfuls of immigrants set to arrive and impatient settlers already camping at Holdfast Bay, Rapid Bay and Kangaroo Island, Light was under immense pressure to identify a location with a suitable harbour, sufficient agricultural land and fresh water. After assessing a number of other potential locations, Light was ordered by England to consider Port Lincoln as a possible site for the capital. While Thomas Lipson had arrived in Port Lincoln earlier and approved of its &quot;beautiful harbour&quot; and &quot;fertile land&quot;, Light was unconvinced from the beginning, as he faced fierce westerly gales, ill-placed islands and rocky reefs on arrival.

Light decided that it might be dangerous for merchant ships trying to enter the unfamiliar territory after a long voyage and that there was not enough of what he thought was good agricultural land, nor enough fresh water to sustain a city. Instead he selected Adelaide as the most suitable place for settlement.

Port Lincoln, however, proved popular with pioneers and developers. The first settlers arrived on 19 March 1839 aboard the ships &quot;Abeona&quot;, &quot;Porter&quot; and &quot;Dorset&quot;. On 3 October 1839, Governor George Gawler proclaimed the whole area from Cape Catastrophe to the head of the Spencer Gulf as one district, which he named the District of Port Lincoln.

In 1840, one year after settlement, the population of Port Lincoln was 270. There were 30 stone houses, a hotel, blacksmith&#x27;s shop and a store in the Happy Valley area. Around this time, Edward John Eyre explored the peninsula that was subsequently named in his honour.

In early 1842, local Aboriginal resistance to the British settlement became so successful that it prompted the near abandonment of Port Lincoln. As a result, Governor George Grey ordered a detachment of the 96th Regiment of the British Army under the command of Lieutenant Hugonin to enforce control in the area. After an initial defeat at Pillaworta, the 96th in combination with the Mounted Police and armed settlers were able to restore full British authority by the end of 1843. A section of Native Police were later deployed to the area to maintain this control. An unknown number of Aboriginal people were killed by soldiers near Pillaworta in retribution for the presumed killings of colonists.

In 1849, five Aboriginal people including an infant were poisoned after being given flour mixed with arsenic by hutkeeper Patrick Dwyer near Port Lincoln. Despite being arrested with strong evidence against him, Dwyer was released from custody by Charles Driver, the Government Resident at Port Lincoln.

Local government formally began on the Eyre Peninsula on 1 July 1880, with the establishment of the District Council of Lincoln. The township of Port Lincoln naturally was included in that area. On 18 August 1921, the Municipality of Port Lincoln was formally proclaimed.

By 1936 the population had grown to 3200 and the town had a first-class water supply. The port had become the commercial pivot for the area, providing for its many agricultural and commercial requirements. City status was granted to Port Lincoln on 21 January 1971 and the proclamation was read at the opening of the tenth annual Tunarama Festival on the Australia Day weekend.

===Water supply===
The lack of a reliable surface water supply was a factor preventing Port Lincoln from being proclaimed the colony&#x27;s capital city in the 1830s. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln outgrew its fresh water supplies. It is now largely dependent on water drawn from groundwater basins in the south of the peninsula.

The southern and western parts of the Eyre Peninsula region also share this resource via the Tod-Ceduna pipeline. The Iron Knob to Kimba pipeline completed in 2007 provides limited transfer capacity of River Murray water into the Tod-Ceduna system. Following the development of a long term water supply plan for Eyre Peninsula, the South Australian government is progressing detailed investigation of augmentation options. These include seawater desalination.

Formerly a potable water resource fed by the Tod River, the Tod Reservoir was taken offline in 2001–2002 due to concerns about rising levels of agricultural chemical contamination and salinity.

===Heritage listings===
Port Lincoln has a number of places listed on the South Australian Heritage Register, including:
* Dorset Place: Old Mill Lookout
* Hawson Place: Hawson&#x27;s Grave
* 152 Proper Bay Road: Arrandale
* Railway Terrace: Port Lincoln railway station
* 36 Washington Street: Port Lincoln Police Station and Courthouse
* 20 Windsor Avenue: Ravendale House

==Demographics==
At June 2018 Port Lincoln had an estimated urban population of 26,326. Aboriginal people make up 5.6% of Port Lincoln&#x27;s population.

==Geography==
Port Lincoln has a contrasting coastal landscape, ranging from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline. The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System brings cold, nutrient-rich water into nearby waters of the Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf. These upwellings support lucrative fisheries, including that of the southern bluefin tuna and sardine.

===Climate===
Port Lincoln has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb). The climate is highly variable due to the town&#x27;s position between the Outback and Southern Ocean. Summers alternate between frequent southerly sea breezes (keeping maxima under ), with occasional northerly heatwaves (that raise the temperature to well over ). Meanwhile, winters are cool and cloudy, with frequent drizzle, showers and cold fronts, albeit with frost being very rare.

There is moderate seasonal temperature variation and seasonal lag, with average maxima ranging from in January to in July, while average minima vary from in February to in August. Average annual rainfall is rather low, , occurring within 127.1 rainfall days, and the wettest month on record was in June 1981. Despite the low intensity of rainfall: there are 154.5 cloudy days and only 57.2 clear days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 16 July 2016 to on 24 January 2019.

==Government==
Port Lincoln is located in the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Flinders and the local government area of City of Port Lincoln.

==Economy==
The economy is based on the huge grain-handling facilities (with a total capacity of over 337,500 tonnes), the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. Home of Australia&#x27;s largest commercial fishing fleet, Port Lincoln now has a thriving aquaculture industry that farms the following species: southern bluefin tuna, yellowtail kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimentally, seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the advent of aquaculture, the main fishing was for southern bluefin tuna. Frank Moorhouse recommended the South Australian government lend the Haldane family 20,000 pounds which they used to build a super vessel. The MFV &quot;Tacoma&quot; was Australia&#x27;s first purpose-built tuna fishing vessel. It revolutionised the industry and began catching the fish off the coast of Port Lincoln in the early 1950s.

The city also functions as a regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula; however, many state government functions are gradually being withdrawn as they become more centralised in Adelaide. During the early years of this century, housing demand has led to a boom in property development, both residential and commercial.

A proposal by Centrex Metals to export iron ore through an expanded facility at the existing Port Lincoln wharf was approved by the South Australian Government c. Oct 2009. The proposal was abandoned by the company following strong public opposition. The chief public concern was the potential harm that spillage or dust plumes might cause to the profitability or reputation of the region&#x27;s dominant seafood industry.

===Tourism===
Port Lincoln is a centre for tourism, with access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight mark Port Lincoln out as a site for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within driving distance.

==Transport==
Port Lincoln railway station is the terminus of Eyre Peninsula Railway, a narrow gauge () railway which consists of three lines; Port Lincoln to Kevin, Cummins to Buckleboo and Yeelanna to Kapinnie.

Port Lincoln was also the port terminus for the privately owned standard-gauge Coffin Bay Tramway that operated from 1966 to 1989 to carry lime sand to the port at Proper Bay on the south side of the town for BHP. It was used as flux in blast furnaces.

Port Lincoln Airport is located a few kilometres north of the city. Regional Express and QantasLink provide multiple daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide. All flights that QantasLink operate in and out of Port Lincoln Airport are operated using their Dash 8-300 aircraft.

The Port Lincoln Bus Service operates Monday to Friday from 9.00 am to 4.30 pm with separate morning and afternoon services. The morning service runs to a fixed route timetable and services Lincoln North and Lincoln South.

Long-distance bus services are operated by Stateliner with multiple daily services to Adelaide and Port Augusta.

==Culture==
The book &quot;Blue Fin&quot; by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln, with the movie of the same name filmed in nearby Streaky Bay.

Some of the ANZAC Cove scenes in &quot;Gallipoli&quot; were also filmed near Port Lincoln.

The first edition of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;, the Australian version of the popular US television series, &quot;Survivor&quot;, was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001.

The Discovery Channel documentary series &quot;Tuna Wranglers &quot;(2007) and &quot;Abalone Wars&quot; were both filmed in and around Port Lincoln.

Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the 4-masted barque &quot;Moshulu&quot;, which anchored outside of Boston Island. &quot;Moshulu&quot; had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer), but there was no grain to be had there, even though &quot;Moshulu&quot; waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. &quot;Moshulu&quot; eventually carried on to Port Victoria for cargo. During the 1939 season, &quot;Passat&quot; and &quot;Lawhill&quot; were also present at Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his experiences on the round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book &quot;The Last Grain Race&quot; (1956), and several pictures of Port Lincoln as it appeared in 1939 are included in his photo-essay of his voyage, &quot;Learning the Ropes&quot;.

On the TV show &quot;Neighbours&quot;, the Brennan brothers, Tyler, Mark and Aaron, are originally from Port Lincoln.

The town was featured in the second series of &quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot;. British comedian Karl Pilkington was in Port Lincoln for the show where he swam with sharks.

==Sport==
According to the Port Lincoln Council the most popular sports are tennis, Australian rules football, soccer, netball and basketball. The Port Lincoln Football League (PLFL) has 6 teams competing including the Mallee Park Football Club which is notable as having produced many Australian Football League players, particularly indigenous. The Centenary Oval has a capacity for 7,500 and has hosted sellout pre-season AFL matches in 2005 and 2015. Port Lincoln Soccer Association runs a 4 team competition.

==Media==
Historically, South Australia&#x27;s first rural newspaper, the &quot;Port Lincoln Herald&quot;, owned by Robert Thomas, was published on 10 April 1839, before ceasing publication in September 1840. According to the first edition, &quot;...The object of the proprietors...is to promulgate just accounts of the capabilities of the only safe and commodious harbour yet known within the territories of South Australia.&quot; Only six issues were released, with the first edition being printed in Hindley Street, Adelaide, and the second issue arriving seven months later, after being printed in a hut at Port Lincoln.

The &quot;Western Weekly News&quot; (22 March 1902 – 1904) was also briefly published in the town, as was another short lived, but outspoken publication, called &quot;Challenger&quot; (28 May 1932 - 4 June 1934), a sister publication of the &quot;West Coast Recorder.&quot; The town was also the base of the &quot;Port Lincoln, Tumby and West Coast Recorder&quot; (22 July 1904 – 6 October 1909), later known as the &quot;West Coast Recorder&quot; (1909-1942), which was then absorbed by the &quot;Port Lincoln Times&quot;. These days, Port Lincoln has one local newspaper (the &quot;Port Lincoln Times)&quot;, a Rural Press publication first issued on 5 August 1927. It is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays and is printed in Murray Bridge at the high-tech Rural Press printing centre.

Port Lincoln has two local commercial radio stations, 89.9 Magic FM and 765 AM 5CC (the first local commercial station) broadcasting out of their Washington Street studio. It is also served by ABC West Coast SA on 1485 AM which broadcasts out of the Civic Centre on Tasman Terrace. It&#x27;s also served by Triple J and ABC Radio National from Tumby Bay and satellite uplink from Melbourne respectively. ABC News Radio is also available on 91.5FM. It also receives KIXFM 87.6.

<text>John Laurens (October 28, 1754 – August 27, 1782) was an American soldier and statesman from South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, best known for his efforts to help recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers.

In 1779, Laurens gained approval from the Continental Congress for his plan to recruit a brigade of 3,000 slaves by promising them freedom in return for fighting. The plan was defeated by political opposition in South Carolina. Laurens was killed in the Battle of the Combahee River in August 1782.

==Early life and education==
John Laurens was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on October 28, 1754, to Henry Laurens and Eleanor Ball Laurens, both of whose families were prosperous as planters cultivating rice. He had French heritage and spoke the language fluently.

John was the eldest of the five children who survived infancy. John and his two younger brothers, Henry Jr. and James, were tutored at home, but after the death of their mother, their father took them to England for their education. His two sisters, Martha and Mary Eleanor, remained with an uncle in Charleston.

By the 1750s, the elder Laurens and his business partner George Austin had become wealthy as owners of one of the largest slave trading houses in North America.

In May 1770, Laurens&#x27;s mother passed away a month after giving birth to his last sibling, Mary Eleanor Laurens, who was one of the five to survive to maturity.

In October 1771, Laurens&#x27;s father moved with his sons to London, and Laurens was educated in Europe from the ages of 16 to 22. For two years beginning in June 1772, he and one brother attended school in Geneva, Switzerland, where they lived with a family friend.

As a youth, Laurens had expressed considerable interest in science and medicine, and later in life, he would be elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. However, upon returning to London in August 1774, he yielded to his father&#x27;s wish that he study law. In November 1774, Laurens began his legal studies at the Middle Temple. Laurens&#x27;s father returned to Charleston, leaving Laurens as guardian to his brothers, both enrolled in British schools.

==Military and diplomatic career==
===Service as Washington&#x27;s aide-de-camp===

Laurens arrived at Charleston in April 1777. That summer he accompanied his father from Charleston to Philadelphia, where his father was to serve in the Continental Congress. Henry Laurens, finding himself unable to prevent his son from joining the Continental Army, used his influence to obtain a position of honor for his 23-year-old son.

General George Washington invited Laurens to join his staff in early August, as a volunteer aide-de-camp. Washington wrote: 

Laurens became close friends with two of his fellow aides-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette. He quickly became known for his reckless courage upon first seeing combat on September 11, 1777, at the Battle of Brandywine during the Philadelphia campaign. Lafayette observed, &quot;It was not his fault that he was not killed or wounded [at Brandywine,] he did everything that was necessary to procure one or t&#x27;other.&quot; Laurens behaved with similar recklessness at the Battle of Germantown, in which he was wounded on October 4, 1777:


Two days after the Battle of Germantown, on October 6, 1777, he was given his official appointment as one of General Washington&#x27;s aides-de-camp, and was commissioned with the rank of lieutenant colonel. From November 2 to December 11, 1777, Washington and several aides, including Laurens, were quartered at the Emlen House, north of Philadelphia in Camp Hill, which served as Washington&#x27;s headquarters through the Battle of White Marsh.

After spending the remainder of the winter of 1777–1778 encamped at Valley Forge, Laurens marched to New Jersey around June 1778, to fight in the Battle of Monmouth. Near the start of battle, Laurens had his horse shot out from under him while he did reconnaissance for Baron von Steuben.

On December 23, 1778, Laurens engaged in a duel with General Charles Lee just outside Philadelphia, after Laurens took offense to Lee&#x27;s slander of Washington&#x27;s character. Lee was wounded in the side by Laurens&#x27;s first shot, and Laurens, believing the wound was more serious than it seemed, went to help the general. However, Lee said it was fine and proposed to shoot a second time. The men&#x27;s seconds, Alexander Hamilton and Evan Edwards, opposed this idea and had the duel end there, despite Lee&#x27;s protests to fire again and Laurens&#x27;s agreement.

===Anti-slavery statements and recruitment of black soldiers===

As the British stepped up operations in the South, Laurens promoted the idea of arming slaves and granting them freedom in return for their service. He had written, &quot;We Americans at least in the Southern Colonies, cannot contend with a good Grace, for Liberty, until we shall have enfranchised our Slaves.&quot; Laurens was set apart from other leaders in Revolutionary-era South Carolina by his belief that black and white people shared a similar nature and could aspire to freedom in a republican society.

In early 1778, Laurens advised his father, who was then the President of the Continental Congress, to use forty slaves he stood to inherit as part of a brigade. Henry Laurens granted the request, but with reservations that caused postponement of the project.

Congress approved the concept of a regiment of slaves in March 1779, and sent Laurens south to recruit a regiment of 3,000 black soldiers; however, the plan was opposed, and Laurens was ultimately unsuccessful. Having won election to the South Carolina House of Representatives, Laurens introduced his black regiment plan in 1779, again in 1780, and a third time in 1782, meeting overwhelming rejection each time. Governor John Rutledge and General Christopher Gadsden were among the opponents.

===Battles in South Carolina===
In 1779, when the British threatened Charleston, Governor Rutledge proposed to surrender the city with the condition that Carolina become neutral in the war. Laurens strongly opposed the idea and fought with Continental forces to repel the British.

====Battle of Coosawhatchie====

On May 3, 1779, Colonel William Moultrie&#x27;s troops, outnumbered two to one, faced 2,400 British regulars under General Augustine Prévost, who had crossed the Savannah River. At a point about two miles east of the Coosawhatchie River, Moultrie had left 100 men to guard a river crossing and provide warning when the British arrived.

Due to Laurens&#x27;s connections, his activities could not escape notice; for example, in a May 5 letter to the governor of Virginia, South Carolina&#x27;s lieutenant governor Thomas Bee added a postscript: &quot;Col. John Laurens received a slight wound in the arm in a skirmish with the enemy&#x27;s advanced party yesterday, &amp; his horse was shot also – he is in a good way – pray let his father know this.&quot;

====Battles of Savannah and Charleston====
That fall, Laurens commanded an infantry regiment in General Benjamin Lincoln&#x27;s failed assault on Savannah, Georgia.

===Prisoner of war===
Laurens was taken prisoner by the British in May 1780, after the fall of Charleston. As a prisoner of war, he was shipped to Philadelphia, where he was paroled with the condition that he would not leave Pennsylvania.

In Philadelphia, Laurens was able to visit his father, who would soon take ship for the Netherlands as American ambassador, in search of loans. During the voyage to his post, Henry Laurens&#x27;s ship was seized by the British, resulting in the elder Laurens&#x27;s imprisonment in the Tower of London.

Determined to return to South Carolina, and in the expectation of being freed by a prisoner exchange in November 1780, Laurens wrote to George Washington and requested a leave of absence from his service as aide-de-camp: 

Washington responded, &quot;The motives which led you to the Southward are too laudable and too important not to meet my approbation.&quot;

===Diplomatic mission to France===
Upon his release, Laurens was unwillingly appointed by Congress in December 1780 as a special minister to France. Preferring to return to the South, he had originally refused the post and proposed Alexander Hamilton as the better candidate. Laurens was ultimately persuaded by both Hamilton and Congress to accept the post. He wrote again to advise Washington that &quot;unfortunately for America, Col. Hamilton was not sufficiently known to Congress to unite their suffrages in his favor and I was assured there remained no other alternative to my acceptance than the total failure of the business. Thus circumstanced I was reduced to submit—and renounce my plan of participating in the southern campaign.&quot;

In March 1781, Laurens and Thomas Paine arrived in France to assist Benjamin Franklin, who had been serving as the American minister in Paris since 1777. Together, they met with King Louis XVI, among others. Laurens gained French assurances that French ships would support American operations that year; the promised naval support was later to prove invaluable at the Siege of Yorktown.

Laurens was also reported to have told the French that without aid for the Revolution, the Americans might be forced by the British to fight against France. When Laurens and Paine returned to America in August 1781, they brought 2.5 million livres in silver, the first part of a French gift of 6 million and a loan of 10 million.

Laurens also was able to arrange a loan and supplies from the Dutch, before returning home. His father Henry Laurens, the American ambassador to the Netherlands who had been captured by the British, was exchanged for General Cornwallis in late 1781, and the senior Laurens had proceeded to the Netherlands to continue loan negotiations.

===British surrender at Yorktown===

Laurens returned from France in time to see the French fleet arrive and to join Washington in Virginia at the siege of Yorktown. He was given command of a battalion of light infantry on October 1, 1781, when its commander was killed. Laurens, under the command of Colonel Alexander Hamilton, led the battalion in the storming of Redoubt No. 10 on October 14.

British troops surrendered on October 17, 1781, and Washington appointed Laurens as the American commissioner for drafting formal terms of the British surrender. Louis-Marie, Vicomte de Noailles, a relative of Lafayette&#x27;s wife, was chosen by Rochambeau to represent the interests of France. At Moore House on October 18, 1781, Laurens and the French commissioner negotiated terms with two British representatives, and the articles of capitulation were signed by General Cornwallis the following day.

===Return to Charleston===
Laurens returned to South Carolina, where he continued to serve in the Continental Army under General Nathanael Greene until his death. As head of Greene&#x27;s &quot;intelligence department&quot;, stationed on the outskirts of the city near Wappoo Creek, Laurens created and operated a network of spies who tracked British operations in and around Charleston, and was given responsibility for guarding Greene&#x27;s lines of secret communication with the British-occupied city.

===Death at Combahee River===
On August 27, 1782, at the age of 27, Laurens was shot from his saddle during the Battle of the Combahee River, as one of the last casualties of the Revolutionary War. Laurens died in what General Greene described sadly as &quot;a paltry little skirmish&quot; with a foraging party, only a few weeks before the British finally withdrew from Charleston.

Laurens had been confined to bed at Wappoo Creek with a raging fever for several days, possibly due to malaria. When he learned that the British were sending a large force out of Charleston to gather supplies, he left his sickbed, &quot;wrote a hurried note to Gen. Greene, and, in disregard of his orders and the important duties with which he had been charged – a practice which the loose discipline of the American forces rendered not unusual – put off for the scene of action.&quot;

On August 26, Laurens reported to General Mordecai Gist near the Combahee River. Gist had learned that 300 British troops under Major William Brereton had already captured a ferry and crossed the river, in search of rice to feed their garrison. Gist sent a detachment with orders to attack the British before sunrise the next morning. Laurens was given orders, at his own request, to take a small force further downriver to man a redoubt at Chehaw Point, where they could fire on the British as they retreated.

Laurens and his troops stopped for the night at a plantation house near the Combahee River. Laurens got little or no sleep, instead &quot;spending the evening in a delightful company of ladies... [and] turned from this happy scene only two hours before he was to march down the river&quot;. With his command, Laurens left the plantation at about 3 o&#x27;clock on the morning of August 27.

Leading a force of fifty Delaware infantrymen, and an artillery captain with a howitzer, Laurens rode toward Chehaw Point. However, the British had anticipated their maneuvers; before Laurens could reach the redoubt, 140 British soldiers had prepared an ambush along the road, concealed in tall grass about one mile from his destination.

When the enemy rose to fire, Laurens ordered an immediate charge, despite the British having superior numbers and the stronger position. Gist was only two miles away, and quickly approaching with reinforcements. According to William McKennan, a captain under Laurens&#x27;s command, Laurens appeared &quot;anxious to attack the enemy previous to the main body coming up,&quot; gambling that his troops, &quot;although few in numbers, [would be] sufficient to enable him to gain a laurel for his brow&quot; before the end of the fighting. McKennan&#x27;s opinion was that Laurens &quot;wanted to do all himself, and have all the honor.&quot;

As Laurens led the charge, the British immediately opened fire, and Laurens fell from his horse fatally wounded. Gist&#x27;s larger force arrived in time to cover a retreat, but was unable to prevent costly losses, including three American dead.

After Laurens&#x27;s death, Colonel Tadeusz Kościuszko, who had been a friend of Laurens, came from North Carolina to take his place in the final weeks of battle near Charleston, also taking over Laurens&#x27;s intelligence network in the area.

Laurens was buried near the site of the battle, at William Stock&#x27;s plantation where he had spent the evening before his death. After Henry Laurens returned from imprisonment in London, he had his son&#x27;s remains moved and reinterred on his own property, the Mepkin Plantation.

The Laurens family sold their plantation in the 19th century, where it was bought and resold by many. In 1936 it was purchased by publisher Henry Luce and his wife Clare Boothe Luce. In 1949, the Luces donated a large part of the former plantation, including an extensive landscape garden, to the Trappists for use as a monastery. As Mepkin Abbey and the Mepkin Abbey Botanical Garden, located near Moncks Corner, South Carolina, the site is open to the public, including the Laurens family graveyard on the monastery grounds.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===

On October 26, 1776, Laurens married Martha Manning in London. Her father, one of Henry Laurens&#x27;s business agents, was a mentor and family friend whose home Laurens had frequently visited during his years in London. Laurens wrote to an uncle, &quot;Pity has obliged me to marry&quot;, an unplanned marriage being necessary to preserve his honor, the reputation of the six-month pregnant Martha, and the legitimacy of their child.

Laurens and his new wife moved from London to a home in Chelsea, but Laurens was zealous in his patriotism and unwilling to remain in England, believing that honor and duty required him to fight in the American Revolution. In December 1776, he sailed for Charleston. His pregnant wife, unable to risk a months-long journey by sea during wartime, stayed behind with her family in London.

Laurens&#x27;s only child, their daughter Frances Eleanor Laurens (1777–1860), was born and baptized on February 18, 1777. Laurens&#x27; father-in-law wrote to him that the infant had &quot;undergone much pain, &amp; misery by a swelling in her hip, &amp; thigh, I believe from a hurt by the carelessness of the nurse&quot;. Fanny was not expected to live, but by July 1777, she had recovered from a successful surgery to her hip. At the age of eight, after the loss of both parents, Fanny was brought to Charleston in May 1785, and was raised there by John Laurens&#x27;s sister Martha Laurens Ramsay and her husband. Against the wishes of the Ramsays, Fanny eloped in 1795 with Francis Henderson, a Scottish merchant. Later in life, she was married to James Cunnington, and died in South Carolina at the age of 83.

Laurens had one grandson, Francis Henderson Jr. (1797–1847), a South Carolina lawyer who died young after struggling with alcoholism, and who did not marry or have children.

===Sexuality and relationship with Alexander Hamilton===
As a young man in Geneva, from ages 16 to 19, Laurens &quot;never had difficulty attracting women and men&quot;, while reserving &quot;his primary emotional commitments for other men.&quot; According to Laurens&#x27;s biographer Gregory D. Massey, this period &quot;marked the beginning of a pattern; he continually centered his life around homosocial attachments to other men.&quot; Homosociality, in sociology, refers to same-sex relationships that are not of a romantic or sexual nature, such as friendship, mentorship, and male bonding.

Shortly after his marriage, while in Washington&#x27;s camp, Laurens met and became extremely close friends with Alexander Hamilton. They exchanged many letters during the several years when different assignments and Laurens&#x27;s capture by the British kept them apart; for example, when the terms of Laurens&#x27;s parole prevented him from being present at Hamilton&#x27;s wedding to Elizabeth Schuyler in December 1780, even though Hamilton had invited him. While emotional language was not uncommon in romantic friendships among those of the same gender in this historical period, Hamilton biographer James Thomas Flexner stated that the intensely expressive language contained in the Hamilton-Laurens letters &quot;raises questions concerning homosexuality&quot; that &quot;cannot be categorically answered&quot;.

Stating that &quot;one must tread gingerly in approaching this matter,&quot; Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow wrote that it is impossible to say &quot;with any certainty&quot; that Laurens and Hamilton were lovers, noting that such an affair would have required the exercise of &quot;extraordinary precautions&quot; because sodomy was a capital offense throughout the colonies at the time. Chernow concluded that based on available evidence, &quot;At the very least, we can say that Hamilton developed something like an adolescent crush on his friend.&quot; According to Chernow, &quot;Hamilton did not form friendships easily and never again revealed his interior life to another man as he had to Laurens&quot;, and after Laurens&#x27;s death, &quot;Hamilton shut off some compartment of his emotions and never reopened it.&quot;

In contrast to Hamilton&#x27;s effusive letters, surviving letters from Laurens to Hamilton were notably less frequent and less passionately worded, although some letters written by Laurens have been lost or may have been destroyed.

Massey has dismissed speculations on John Laurens&#x27;s supposed homosexuality and on a Laurens-Hamilton relationship as unsubstantiated, concluding, &quot;Their relationship was platonic, a bond formed by their devotion to the Revolution and mutual ambition for fame.&quot; Years later, Massey regretted that the tone of his assertion had been decisive rather than equivocal, conceding that the matter &quot;can not be definitively resolved.&quot;

==Legacy==
===In popular culture===

John Laurens was the subject of two short educational films, both released in 1972 by Learning Corporation of America. Based on Laurens&#x27;s correspondence with his father, the first film dramatized the young man&#x27;s decision to leave England, and the second outlined his battles in the Continental Army and his death. Michael Douglas played the leading role of Laurens.

Laurens was featured in an episode of the 1984 &quot;George Washington&quot; miniseries, portrayed by Kevin Conroy.

Laurens was depicted heroically as a supporting character in the 2015 musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;. Anthony Ramos originated the role of Laurens in the off-Broadway and Broadway casts, including the 2020 film of the stage production.

===Historical tributes===
In October 1782, Alexander Hamilton wrote to General Nathanael Greene of Laurens&#x27;s death: 

In 1834, Hamilton&#x27;s son and biographer John Church Hamilton named his youngest son Laurens Hamilton, a name that continued to recur over several generations in that branch of the Hamilton family.

Nathanael Greene, in general orders announcing the death of Laurens, wrote &quot;The army has lost a brave officer and the public a worthy citizen.&quot;

Three years after Laurens&#x27;s death, George Washington responded to a question about Laurens&#x27;s character by stating that &quot;no man possessed more of the &quot;amor patria&quot; [love of country]. In a word, he had not a fault, that I ever could discover, unless intrepidity bordering upon rashness could come under that denomination; and to this he was excited by the purest motives.&quot;

Gregory D. Massey, a history professor at Freed–Hardeman University and author of a Laurens biography, wrote in 2003 that &quot;Laurens speaks more clearly to us today than other men of the American Revolution whose names are far more familiar.&quot; Massey attributed the modern relevance of Laurens to his expressed belief, uncommon among his southern political contemporaries,
===Geographical names===

<text>Birgu ( , ), also known by its title Città Vittoriosa (&#x27;Victorious City&#x27;), is an old fortified city on the south side of the Grand Harbour in the South Eastern Region of Malta. The city occupies a promontory of land with Fort Saint Angelo at its head and the city of Cospicua at its base. Birgu is ideally situated for safe anchorage, and over time it has developed a very long history with maritime, mercantile and military activities.

Birgu is a very old locality with its origins in medieval times. Prior to the establishment of Valletta as capital and main city of Malta, military powers that wanted to rule the Maltese islands would need to obtain control of Birgu due to its significant position in the Grand Harbour. In fact, it served as the base of the Order of Saint John and &quot;de facto&quot; capital city of Malta from 1530 to 1571. Birgu is well known for its vital role in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565.

In the early 20th century, Birgu had a population of over 6000 people. Over the years this decreased, and stood at 2,629 in March 2014. The local population speaks the Cottonera dialect, which is, however, most limited in Birgu.

==History==

Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, the Angevines, the Aragonese and the Order of Saint John all contributed to the development of Birgu.

Birgu was part of a town named Birmula. When the order of St John came to Malta they planned to build 3 cities from this land. It started from Senglea, then Vittoriosa and Cospicua. The rest of the land was named Cottonera and it was surrounded with the Cottonera lines.

In the Middle Ages, the islands&#x27; communal organisation in this period pitted the Mdina town-council, or &quot;Universitas&quot;, against the independent entity centred around the &quot;Castrum Maris&quot;. Many inhabitants of Birgu, and the neighbouring villages argued that they were not liable to pay taxes to the Mdina town-council, as they fell within &quot;Castrum Maris&quot; jurisdiction. For example, this was the case with the inhabitants of Żejtun, who refused to pay the taxes due to the Mdina council in 1473, even if as late as 1494 they were expected to take refuge in Mdina, rather than Birgu.

After being driven out of Rhodes by the Ottoman Empire, the Order of Saint John were granted Malta as their new home. In 1526, the Order sent a commission made up of eight knights to Malta, representing each of the langues. They described Birgu as a small defenceless town with old houses in poor condition. When they arrived in 1530, they decided to make Birgu the capital city of Malta, since the former capital, Mdina, was inland and did not suit their naval requirements.

The city was fortified in the 1530s and strengthened in the 1550s in preparation for an attack by the Ottoman Empire. This included the construction of the Castle of St Angelo, a large fortification separated from the city by a narrow channel, instead of the ancient &quot;Castrum Maris&quot;. The castle was connected to the city by means of a drawbridge.

Birgu was the site of major battles between the Knights and the Ottoman Empire during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. After four months of successful defence by the Knights, the city was almost captured by the Ottoman army in August, but was recaptured by the Knights under Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette. Reinforcements from Sicily arrived a month later, and the siege was abandoned by the Ottomans. After this, a new capital city was built on Mount Sceberras, bearing the name Valletta. In 1571, the Knights transferred their convent and seat to the new capital and Birgu lost some of its importance. Despite this, after the siege, Birgu was given the title &quot;Città Vittoriosa&quot;, Italian for &quot;victorious city&quot;.

After the taking of Malta by Napoleon in 1798, French forces were garrisoned in the city. Soon after the Maltese rebelled and the Grand Harbour area was blockaded by Maltese rebels aided by Britain, Portugal and Naples. The French eventually capitulated in September 1800, and Malta became a British protectorate. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet established its base in Birgu, and British forces remained stationed in Birgu until 1979.

In 1806, Birgu&#x27;s gunpowder magazine exploded, killing over 200 people.

Birgu was heavily bombed during World War II due to its proximity to the Malta Dockyard. A number of historic buildings were destroyed, including the Birgu Clock Tower and the Auberge d&#x27;Allemagne.

In recent years, due to an agreement made by the Maltese Government with Sovereign Military Order of Malta, this Catholic Order of Knighthood has returned to the Island. This agreement, which has a duration of 99 years, grants the Knights of Malta the exclusive use of Fort St. Angelo in Birgu.

==Attractions==
Birgu is the location of several tourist attractions. The historic Vittoriosa Waterfront contains the former Palace of the General of the Galleys and the Order of St John&#x27;s treasury. The area was refurbished in the early 2000s, and both buildings are used for other activities: the former is now a casino, while the latter is home to the Malta Maritime Museum. A second museum, the Vittoriosa 1565 Museum, is also located in the town and is dedicated to the siege and the battle in the town in 1565.
St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church, one of several churches in the parish, was once the Conventual Church of the Order of St John. It is dedicated to St. Lawrence of Rome, and the feast is very popular among locals for the decorations in the local streets. The celebrations start on 31 July and continue till 10 August, the saint&#x27;s feast day. Other churches in Birgu include the Monastery of St. Scholastica and the Our Lady of Annunciation Church which is run by the Dominican Order. This church is also known as St. Dominic&#x27;s Church. The feast of Saint Dominic is held every last Sunday of August. The Freedom Monument commemorates the departure of British forces from the island in 1979. Birgu also contains five Auberges of the Knights, including the Auberge d&#x27;Angleterre, for some time the home of the English Knights of St John on the island, which now contains a public library.


At the centre of the Grand Harbour, the 16th-century Fort St Angelo still stands and is currently undergoing restoration. The central piazza in Birgu was badly damaged by bombing during World War II, but one 19th-century palace thought to have been designed by Giuseppe Bonavia survives, and is used as the headquarters of the St Lawrence Band Club.

==Demographics==
In 1901, Birgu had a population of 6,093 people. After falling slightly over the following 20 years, this figure had increased to 6,673 in 1931. However, in 1948 the population stood at just 3,816, although it had increased slightly by 1957. The city&#x27;s population fell in the following four censuses, and in 2005 was recorded as 2,701. By 2011 the estimated value had risen slightly to 2,758. In March 2013 the population stood at 2,673, and it was slightly lower in March 2014, when it stood at 2,629.

==Government==
Birgu&#x27;s local council was established by the Local Councils Act of 1993. The first election was held on 19 February 1994 and John Boxall was elected as mayor. In 1995 Joseph C. Azzopardi took over as mayor but in the 1998 local elections Boxall became the mayor once again. He contested in later elections in 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2012 and has held the office ever since. The present council is made up of the following people:
*John Boxall (PL) - mayor
*Christopher Cassar (PL) - vice-mayor
*Anthony Gellel (PN)
*Trevor Mizzi (PL)
*Jason Portelli (PL)
The Birgu Local Council is housed at Auberge de France.

==Notable people==
The architects and engineers Girolamo Cassar, his brother Andrew Cassar, and his son Vittorio Cassar were all born in Birgu in the sixteenth century. The Cassar family moved to Valletta after the new city was built in the 1570s.

Architect Lorenzo Gafà (1638–1703), who worked on a number of churches in Malta including St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Mdina, was born in Birgu. He also designed many of the historic buildings in the Vittoriosa Waterfront area, some of which have recently been restored.

Paul Boffa (1890–1962), the Prime Minister of Malta between 1947 and 1950 and the country&#x27;s first Labour Party Prime Minister, was also born in the city.

Sr. Beniamina Portelli, founder and director of the St. Monica Choir was born in Birgu.

Prospero Grech (1925–2019) was an Augustinian friar, who co-founded the Patristic Institute Augustinianum in Rome and was created a cardinal in 2012.

<doc id="430950" wikidata="Q2713782" url="?curid=430950" title="Masahiro Mori (roboticist)">
<text>was a Japanese roboticist noted for his pioneering work in the fields of robotics and automation, his research achievements in humans&#x27; emotional responses to non-human entities, as well as for his views on religion. The ASIMO robot was designed by one of Masahiro&#x27;s students.

==Life and career==
In 1970, Mori published &quot;Bukimi No Tani&quot; (不気味の谷 &quot;The Uncanny Valley&quot;) in &quot;Energy&quot;. The article forwarded the hypothesis that as robots become more humanlike, they appear more familiar until a point is reached at which subtle imperfections of appearance make them look eerie. The observation led Mori to the belief that robot builders should not attempt to make their creations overly lifelike in appearance and motion.

In 1974, Mori published &quot;The Buddha in the Robot: a Robot Engineer&#x27;s Thoughts on Science and Religion&quot; in which he discussed the metaphysical implications of robotics. In the book, he wrote &quot;I believe robots have the buddha-nature within them--that is, the potential for attaining buddhahood.&quot;

In 1988, Mori founded the first nationwide robot-building competition in Japan and widely promoted robot competitions in the years since then. Of Robocon, Mori said, &quot;When we lose ourselves in an activity, we become creative, friendly and funny. Think of how children are when they are playing. They are completely absorbed in the game; their eyes shine and they are all smiles. They&#x27;re into the game, not themselves. That&#x27;s the message of Robocon, too: To not be self-centered, but to love others and share the joy of creating wonderful things.&quot;

Mori was later president of the Mukta Research Institute, which he founded in Tokyo in order to promote his views on religion and robots. The institute also provides consultation on the use of automation and robotics in industry. Mori died on 12 January 2025, at the age of 97.

<text>Bernhard Heinrich Karl Martin, Prince of Bülow ( ; 3 May 1849 – 28 October 1929) was a German statesman who served as the imperial chancellor of the German Empire and minister-president of Prussia from 1900 to 1909. A fervent supporter of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, Bülow devoted his chancellorship to transforming Germany into a global power. Despite presiding over sustained economic growth and major technological advancements within his country, his government&#x27;s foreign policy did much to antagonize France and Great Britain thereby contributing significantly to the outbreak of the World War I, a conflict that resulted in the fall of the German Empire.

Born into a prominent family of Danish-German aristocrats, Bülow entered the German foreign service after his father, Bernhard Ernst von Bülow, was appointed foreign secretary in Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s government. He held several diplomatic posts, including German ambassador to Rome, before being appointed foreign secretary in 1897 by Wilhelm II. Three years later, he was appointed chancellor following the resignation of the Prince of Hohenlohe.

As chancellor, Bülow promoted cautious and conservative domestic policies while pursuing an ambitious and expansionist policy in foreign affairs. His open challenge to France&#x27;s growing control over Morocco sparked the First Moroccan Crisis, which aggravated the French and the British and helped strengthen the Entente Cordiale. In 1908, Wilhelm&#x27;s indiscreet remarks were published during the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Affair, causing significant damage to German foreign relations and the Kaiser&#x27;s prestige. Bülow was blamed for failing to prevent the blunder and, having lost the support of both the Kaiser and the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, he resigned in 1909 and was succeeded by Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg.

Bülow moved to Rome after his resignation. He came out of retirement in late 1914 to serve as interim ambassador to Italy, but was unable to bring King Victor Emmanuel III to the side of the Central Powers. Bülow died in Rome in 1929 at the age of 80.

==Early life==
He was born at Klein-Flottbeck, Holstein (now part of Altona, Hamburg). His father, Bernhard Ernst von Bülow, was a Danish and German statesman and member of an old House of Bülow, while his mother was a wealthy heiress, Louise Victorine Rücker (1821–1894). His brother, Major-General Karl Ulrich von Bülow, was a cavalry commander during World War I. Bülow attributed his grasp of English and French to having learnt it from governesses as a young child. His father spoke French, and his mother spoke English, as was common in Hamburg society.

In 1856, his father was sent to the Federal Diet in Frankfurt to represent Holstein and Lauenburg, when Otto von Bismarck was also there to represent Prussia. He became a great friend of Bismarck&#x27;s son Herbert when they played together. At 13, the family moved to Neustrelitz when his father became Chief Minister to the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, where Bernhard attended the Frankfort gymnasium, before attending Lausanne, Leipzig and Berlin Universities.

He volunteered for military service during the Franco-Prussian War and became a lance-corporal in the King&#x27;s Hussar Regiment. In December 1870, the squadron was in action near Amiens, and he later described charging and killing French riflemen with his sabre. He was promoted to lieutenant and was invited to remain in the army after the war but declined. He completed his law degree at the University of Greifswald in 1872. Afterwards, he entered first the Prussian Civil Service and then the diplomatic service.
His religion was Lutheran.

==Early career==
In 1873 his father became State Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the German government, serving under Bismarck. Bülow entered the diplomatic corps. His first short assignments were to Rome, St. Petersburg, Vienna and then Athens. In 1876, he was appointed attaché to the German embassy in Paris, attended the Congress of Berlin as a secretary and became second secretary to the embassy in 1880.

In 1884, he had hoped to be posted to London but instead became first secretary at the embassy in St. Petersburg. On the way to his new assignment, he stayed for a couple of days at Varzin with the Bismarck family. Bismarck explained that he considered relations with Russia much more important than with Britain and so he had posted Bülow there. Bismarck reported himself as impressed by Bülow&#x27;s calmness and demeanour during the interview. In Russia, he acted as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in 1887 and advocated the ethnic cleansing of Poles from Polish territories of the German Empire in a future armed conflict. Bülow wrote regularly to the Foreign Office, complaining about his superior, Ambassador Schweinitz, who, however, was well-liked. Bülow earned for himself a reputation as only a schemer. In 1885, Friedrich von Holstein noted that Bülow was attempting to have Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst removed as ambassador to France to get the post despite meanwhile exchanging friendly letters with him.

On 9 January 1886, still in St. Petersburg, he married Maria Anna Zoe Rosalia Beccadelli di Bologna, Principessa di Camporeale, Marchesa di Altavilla, whose first marriage with Count Karl von Dönhoff had been annulled by the Holy See in 1884. The princess, an accomplished pianist and pupil of Franz Liszt, was a stepdaughter of Marco Minghetti and the daughter of Donna Laura Minghetti (née Acton). She had been married for sixteen years and had three children. Bülow previously had numerous love affairs, but the marriage was intended to further his career. In 1888, he was offered the choice of appointments to Washington, DC, or Bucharest, and chose Bucharest, as Maria objected to the prospect of traveling to the United States and leaving her family behind. He spent the next five years scheming to be appointed to Rome, where his wife was well connected. King Umberto I of Italy was persuaded to write to Kaiser Wilhelm that he would be pleased if Bülow became ambassador there, which occurred in 1893.

==State Secretary for Foreign Affairs==
On 21 June 1897 Bülow received a telegram instructing him to go to Kiel to speak to Wilhelm. On the way, he stopped at Frankfurt while changing trains and spoke to Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg. Eulenburg explained that Wilhelm wanted a new State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and urged Bülow to take the post, which his father had once held. Eulenburg also passed on advice about how best to manage Wilhelm, who lived on praise and could not stand to be contradicted. In Berlin, Bülow first spoke to Friedrich von Holstein, who was head of the political department of the German Foreign Office. Holstein advised him that although he would have preferred the present Secretary, Adolf Marschall von Bieberstein, to stay in his post, Wilhelm was determined to replace him and that he would prefer the successor to be Bülow. Perhaps Bülow might be able to find him an ambassador&#x27;s post in due course. Chancellor Hohenlohe, desperate to retire because of old age, urged Bülow to take the position with an eye to succeeding him as chancellor. Bülow urged Hohenlohe to continue in office for as long as he could.

On 26 June, Bülow met with the Kaiser, who advised that it would be one of the new secretary&#x27;s main tasks to set about building a world-class fleet capable of taking on the British without precipitating a war. Bülow asked for time to consider the offer, and on 3 August, he accepted. The two men formed a good working relationship. Rather than oppose Wilhelm, which some of his predecessors had done, Bülow agreed with him on all matters by sometimes privately relying on Wilhelm&#x27;s bad memory and frequent changes of opinion to take the action that he thought best and ignore Wilhelm had instructed. The post of State Secretary was subordinate to that of the Chancellor and under Bismarck&#x27;s chancellorship, it had been only a functionary. Under Bülow, that was largely reversed, Hohenlohe being content to let Bülow manage foreign affairs with his principal adviser, Holstein. Wilhelm would call on Bülow every morning to discuss state affairs but would rarely see the chancellor.
==Imperial State Secretary==

Bülow also held a seat in the Prussian government. Although Wilhelm was emperor of all Germany, he was also king of Prussia. As Foreign Secretary, Bülow was chiefly responsible for carrying out the policy of colonial expansion with which the emperor was identified. He was welcomed by the Foreign Office because he was the first professional diplomat to be placed in charge since Bismarck&#x27;s resignation in 1890. Bülow had been wary of accepting the post if Holstein remained as Imperial First Councillor, as Holstein had in practice held great authority in recent years. Holstein was regarded as indispensable because of his long experience in office, rank, cunning and phenomenal memory. Eulenburg advised Bülow to stake out a firm but working relationship immediately on his arrival, and both succeeded in working together. In 1899, on bringing to a successful conclusion the negotiations by which Germany acquired the Caroline Islands, he was raised to the rank of Count.

In October 1900, Bülow was summoned to Wilhelm&#x27;s hunting retreat at Hubertsstock, where Wilhelm asked Bülow to become Chancellor of the German Empire and Prime Minister of Prussia. Bülow queried whether he was the best man for the job. Wilhelm admitted he would have preferred Eulenburg on a personal level but was not sure he was sufficiently able. On 16 October, Bülow was summoned again to Homburg, where the Kaiser met his train in person. Wilhelm explained that Hohenlohe had announced he could no longer be and so Bülow accepted the job. A replacement State Secretary was necessary, which was first offered to Holstein, who turned it down since he preferred not to take a position that required appearing before the Reichstag. The post was given to Baron Oswald von Richthofen, who had already been serving as undersecretary to Bülow. It was made clear that the State Secretary&#x27;s post would now revert to the subordinate role it had played in Bismarck&#x27;s time, with Holstein remaining the more important adviser on foreign affairs.

== Chancellor ==


Bülow&#x27;s mornings were reserved for Wilhelm, who would visit the chancellery every morning when in Berlin. His determination to remain on Wilhelm&#x27;s good side was remarkable, even for those accustomed to his irascible manner. Wilhelm&#x27;s household controller noted, &quot;Whenever, by oversight, he expresses an opinion in disagreement with the emperor, he remains silent for a few moments and then says the exact contrary, with the preface, &#x27;as Your Majesty so wisely remarked&#x27;&quot;. He gave up tobacco, beer, coffee and liqueurs and took 35 minutes of exercise every morning and would ride in good weather through the Tiergarten. He would, on Sundays, take long walks in the woods. In 1905, at 56, he led his old Hussars regiment at the gallop in an imperial parade and was rewarded by an appointment to the rank of major general. Wilhelm remarked to Eulenburg in 1901, &quot;Since I have Bülow I can sleep peacefully&quot;. His first conspicuous act as chancellor was a masterly defence in the Reichstag of German imperialism in China. Bülow often spent his time defending German foreign policy there, to say nothing of covering for the Kaiser&#x27;s many undiplomatic gaffes. In a speech in November 1906, Bülow introduced the concept of &quot;encirclement&quot; to the Reichstag that triggered the Teutonic press to blame &quot;Der Krieg in der Gegenwart&quot;. To Germany, the Triple Entente was a disaster, but he put a brave face on it.

===Domestic policy and politics===
Various reforms were also introduced during his tenure, including an extension of the period in which workers could claim accident insurance (1900), the making of industrial arbitration courts compulsory for towns with a population of more than 20,000 (1901) and an extension of health insurance and further controls on child labour (1903). A polling booth law was introduced that improved the secret ballot in 1904. Two years later, payment for Reichstag deputies was introduced.

In preparation for the 1907 election, Bülow created the &quot;Bülow Bloc&quot; of parties that were fervently antisocialist and anticlerical, devoutly patriotic, enthusiastically imperialist, and loyal to the Kaiser and the Fatherland. What Bebel labeled the &quot;Hottentot election&quot; was a disaster for the Social Democrats, who lost almost half their seats. However, Bülow was unable to turn the election coalition into a stable bloc in parliament

Bülow also produced proposals for the expropriation of lands from Prussian Poland for purposes of German settlement. In 1908, after the passing of an expropriation bill in the Diet, Bülow quelled concerns from Cardinal Kopp that the bill was too extreme. Other protesters of Bülow&#x27;s expropriation bills included Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz, who pleaded publicly to the global intellectual community for support.

===Economic policy===
Under pressure from the Junker-dominated Agrarian League, Bülow passed a tariff in 1902 that increased the duties on agriculture. As a result, the German grain production became one of the most protected in the world. Bülow&#x27;s government also negotiated a series of commercial treaties with other European countries that came into force in March 1906.

=== Foreign policy ===

Bülow served as foreign minister, 1897–1909. To gain a stronger voice in world affairs he encouraged Admiral Tirpitz&#x27;s naval expansion policy. Expecting Britain to be defeated by Russia he planned to pick up some colonies of the British Empire. He miscalculated, and alienated Britain even more, as it moved closer to an alliance with France and Russia. Bülow was motivated by domestic political concerns in his support of Tirpitz naval policy. In 1898 he said that such a policy would &quot;mobilize the best patriotic forces&quot; and &quot;appeal to the highest national emotions&quot; which would in turn &quot;keep the non-Socialist workers away from Social Democracy&quot; and pull the worker away from &quot;the ensnarements of the socialists and accustom him to the monarchical order&quot;.
Britain still held the balance of power in Europe. France and Britain had been colonial rivals and had a long mutual opposition, but King Edward VII was determined to boost British popularity in France by a personal tour. Serious negotiations for the Entente Cordiale began between the French ambassador to London, Paul Cambon, and the British Foreign Secretary, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne. As part of settling differences, France agreed not to dispute British control of Egypt if Britain agreed to France&#x27;s claims to Morocco.

On 24 March 1904, France formally informed the German ambassador of the new Anglo-French Convention. Prince Hugo von Radolin, the ambassador, responded that he felt the agreement natural and justified. The German press noted that the deal in Morocco did not harm national interests and that the French intervention to restore order in the country might help German trade. Still, Bülow was cynical and took the Social Darwinist&#x27;s view that expansion was a fact of life. His policy was unclear, even to the generals.

Although not swayed by bellicose generals, he followed a central planning agenda. If Prussia was euphoric, Bülow remained ambitious for imperial grandiosity and world power. Commercial growth in iron, steel, mining, railways and ironclads, and a new navy was driven by huge outputs and highly-competitive contractors. His chauvinism was extensive, a defensive embrasure against British alliance-building on which Germany would reject negotiations. He had promised to reply directly to British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain but thought better of it: &quot;it is the English who must make advances to us&quot;. That unintentionally entrenched the Entente.

Bülow assured the British ambassador that he was pleased to see Britain and France settling their differences. He informed the Reichstag that Germany had no objections to the deal and no concerns about German interests in Morocco. Holstein had a different view: intervention in Moroccan affairs was governed by the Treaty of Madrid. Holstein argued that Germany had been sidelined by not being included in the negotiations and that Morocco was a country that showed promise for German influence and trade, which must eventually suffer if it came under French control. Previously he had dismissed any possibility of agreement between France and Britain. France now offered military assistance to Morocco to improve order in the country. Bülow responded by supporting the position of an independent Morocco, encouraging the United States to become involved and threatened war if France intervened. He was now convinced that the new friendliness between France and Britain was a threat to Germany, particularly if the accord deepened, but France was ill-prepared for war. Despite the possible risks of assassination, Bülow persuaded Wilhelm to make a visit to Tangier in 1905, where he made a speech supporting Morocco&#x27;s independence, but his presence there simultaneously demonstrated Germany&#x27;s determination to maintain its own influence.

===Algeciras Conference===

A friendly German naval presence in Morocco and a military base nearby could threaten the British or the important trade routes through the Mediterranean. The British continued to support beleaguered French Foreign Minister Theophile Delcassé. Lansdowne had been surprised by the German reaction, but Britain might take on the fledgling German fleet before it grew too large. On 3 June 1905, Abdelaziz of Morocco, prompted by Germany, rejected the French offer of assistance and called for an international conference. On 6 June, after Delcassé had resigned, news spread to Berlin. The following morning, Bülow was elevated to the rank of prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;). The occasion coincided with the marriage of the crown prince and echoed the elevation of Bismarck to prince in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Germany continued to press for further French concessions. Bülow carefully instructed Radolin and also spoke to the French ambassador in Berlin. However, the effect was somewhat the reverse of what he intended by hardening the resolve of French Premier Maurice Rouvier to resist further demands for &quot;rapprochement&quot;. The Algeciras Conference commenced on 16 January 1906 at Algeciras Town Hall. During the conference, a British fleet of 20 battleships, with accompanying cruisers and destroyers, visited the port town, and all of the delegates were invited on board.

The conference went badly for Germany, with a vote against German proposals that was 10–3. Holstein wished to threaten war against France, but Bülow ordered Holstein to take no further part in the conference. No satisfactory outcome for Germany was in sight by April, which left the only course of action to wind it down as best he could. The result was received badly in Germany, with objections raised in the press. On 5 April 1906, Bülow was obliged to appear before the Reichstag to defend the outcome, and during a heated exchange, he collapsed and was carried from the hall. At first, it was thought he had suffered a fatal stroke. Lord Fitzmaurice, in the British House of Lords, compared the incident with that of the death of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, a compliment that was much appreciated in Germany. Bülow&#x27;s collapse was ascribed to overwork and influenza but, after a month&#x27;s rest, he was able to resume his duties.

===Scandal===
In 1907, during the Harden–Eulenburg Affair, Adolf Brand, the founding editor of the homosexual periodical &quot;Der Eigene&quot;, printed a pamphlet alleging that Bülow had been blackmailed for engaging in homosexual practices and was morally obligated to oppose Paragraph 175 of the German penal code, which outlawed homosexuality. Sued for slander and brought to trial on 7 November 1907, Brand asserted that Bülow had embraced and kissed his private secretary, Privy Councilor Max Scheefer, at all-male gatherings hosted by Eulenburg. Testifying in his own defense, Bülow denied the accusation but remarked he had heard unsavoury rumours about Eulenburg. Taking the stand, Eulenburg defended himself against Brand&#x27;s charge by denying that he had ever held such events and claimed that he had never engaged in same-sex acts, which subsequently led to a perjury trial. Despite concluding testimony by the chief of the Berlin police that Bülow may have been the victim of a homosexual blackmailer, he easily prevailed in court, and Brand was sent to prison.

===&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Affair===

In November 1907, Wilhelm made a long-planned state visit to Britain. He had attempted to cancel the visit because of the recent scandals, but it went ahead and was so successful that he decided to remain in Britain for a holiday. He rented a house for the purpose from Colonel Edward Montague Stuart-Wortley and spoke freely to its owner while he was there. In September 1908, they discussed Wortley&#x27;s idea to have London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; publish the contents of their conversations using the notes Stuart-Wortley had taken. He believed that doing so would help improve relations between their two countries. Wilhelm agreed, and the journalist Harold Spender wrote an article in the form of an interview. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; then sent the draft to Wilhelm in Berlin and asked for approval to publish it.

What happened with the manuscript next, and especially Bülow&#x27;s role in the matter, has been a subject of historical controversy for decades. Recent scholarship has largely disproved Bülow&#x27;s claim that he never read the draft and had relied on the Foreign Office to make any necessary changes and approve it. Historian John C. G. Röhl calls Bülow&#x27;s version a &quot;cynical cover-up&quot; to deflect from himself the blame for the publishing of the damaging article. It is all but certain that Bülow did read the draft that Wilhelm forwarded to him and then sent it to the Foreign Office for review. The officials there made a few minor factual corrections and sent it back to Bülow on the assumption that he would make the final decision on publication since the matter was so highly political. Bülow personally discussed the article with Wilhelm on 12 October. After talking the next day with Foreign Affairs Secretary Wilhelm von Schoen about various suggested changes, Bülow sent the manuscript to Martin Freiherr von Rücker-Jenisch, a cousin of his who was liaison with the Foreign Office in the Kaiser&#x27;s suite. Jenisch sent the draft back to Wilhelm with a letter outlining three places where &quot;exception can be taken to the wording&quot; and noting changes in the margins based on the comments Bülow had made. Wilhelm signed the cover letter and sent the annotated draft to Stuart-Wortley on 16 October. (The source does not say whether either Stuart-Wortley or &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; made any of the suggested changes to the original draft.)

The article appeared in print on 28 October and caused a storm in both Britain and Germany. Wilhelm expressed many controversial and offensive opinions in it: 
* The English were mad as March hares because they repeatedly rejected his offers of friendship.
* Most Germans disliked the English, and his own friendly attitude put him in a &quot;distinct minority&quot;.
* He had intervened against France and Russia on Britain&#x27;s behalf during the Second Boer War.
* He had provided a campaign plan that was used by the British during the war.
* Germany&#x27;s fleet buildup was directed not against Britain but Japan.

Wilhelm thus managed to offend Japanese, French, Russian and especially British sensibilities. Even Germans were outraged, as he claimed to have helped the British in their war against the Boers, whom most Germans had favoured.

Bülow accused the Foreign Office of failing to comment properly on the article. The office responded that it was his role to decide on publication in such a situation. Questions arose as to Wilhelm&#x27;s competence to rule and the role he should be permitted under the constitution. The matter was debated in the Reichstag, where Bülow had to defend his own position and that of Wilhelm. Bülow wrote to Wilhelm and offered to resign unless Wilhelm could give him full support in the matter. Bülow arranged the publication of a defence of the events in the &quot;Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, which glossed over Wilhelm&#x27;s remarks and concentrated on the failings of the Foreign Office in not examining the article properly. It explained that Bülow had offered to take full responsibility for the office&#x27;s failings, but Wilhelm had refused to accept his resignation.

Bülow succeeded in turning away criticism from himself in the Reichstag and finished his speech to cheering from the assembly. Holstein observed that the nature of the comments meant that he could almost certainly not have defended Wilhelm for making them and that Bülow could not have done otherwise: disputing the factual accuracy of much of what Wilhelm had said and leaving blame for events squarely with him. His explanation was that the comments had been made with the best of intentions and would certainly not be repeated. He declared his conviction that the disastrous effects of the interview would induce Wilhelm to observe strict reserve, even in private conversations, or neither he nor any successor could assume responsibility.
Wilhelm was due to be away from Germany during the Reichstag debate on a trip to Austria and received much criticism for not staying at home. Wilhelm queried whether he ought to cancel the trip, but Bülow advised him to continue with it. Holstein asked Bülow about Wilhelm&#x27;s absence; Bülow denied advising Wilhelm to go. Matters were not improved when during the visit, Count Dietrich von Hülsen-Haeseler, the chief of the German Imperial Military Cabinet, died from a heart attack at Donaueschingen, the estate of Prince Max von Fürstenberg. On Wilhelm&#x27;s return, Bülow persuaded him to endorse a statement that he concurred with Bülow&#x27;s statements to the Reichstag. Wilhelm was at that point close to breakdown and considering abdication.

Wilhelm withdrew from public appearances for six weeks, which was generally seen as an act of penitence rather than the consequence of his depression. Public opinion began to reflect on whether the Chancellor had failed to advise him properly and then failed to defend Wilhelm&#x27;s actions in the Reichstag. Wilhelm&#x27;s own view of the affair began to change to blaming Bülow for failing to warn him of the difficulties that the article would cause. He determined that Bülow would have to be replaced. In June 1909, difficulties arose in obtaining additional financing for ongoing ship construction. Wilhelm warned Bülow that if he failed to carry a majority for imposing inheritance taxes, Bülow would have to resign. He was defeated by eight votes. On board the royal yacht, &quot;Hohenzollern&quot;, on 26 June, Bülow offered his resignation, exactly twelve years after accepting the office.

On 14 July, the resignation was announced, and Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg became the new Chancellor. Wilhelm dined with the Bülows and expressed his regret that the prince was determined to resign. He observed that he had been informed that some of those who voted against the inheritance tax had done so out of animosity against Bülow and his handling of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; affair, rather out of opposition to the tax. For his services to the state, Bülow was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle set in diamonds.

==Later life==
After his resignation in 1909, Bülow lived principally at the villa in Rome that he had purchased for his retirement. Part of the summer was usually spent by him at Klein Flottbek, near Hamburg, or on the island of Norderney. A large fortune left him by a cousin, a Hamburg merchant, enabled him to live in elegant leisure and to make his house in Rome a centre of literary and political society.

He employed his leisure in writing for the centenary celebrations of the Wars of Liberation, a remarkable book on Imperial Germany, extolling its achievements and defending the main lines of his own foreign policy. In a revised edition of his book on Imperial Germany, published after the start of the First World War, he omitted or altered many passages that seemed compromising in light of the war like his policy of lulling Britain into a false sense of security while the German Navy was being constructed. He was understood to be in deeply malodorous company with Wilhelm, who never forgave him his attitude and action with regard to a 1908 interview in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

=== Wartime diplomat ===
In 1914–1915, Bülow was the ambassador to Italy but failed to bring King Victor Emmanuel III to join the Central Powers. Italy had declared its neutrality at the outbreak of the war but intimated on 5 July 1914 through diplomatic channels that Austria-Hungary&#x27;s ultimatum to Serbia was aggressive and provocative. On 9 December 1914, Sidney Sonnino addressed the Austrian Note to the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold, to call attention to Article VII of the treaty by which Italy participated in the Triple Alliance, with particular reference to the clause that bound Austria-Hungary, if it disturbed the status quo in the Balkans even by a temporary occupation of Serbian territory, to come to an agreement with Italy and to arrange for compensations. The questions of the Trentino Agreement and Trieste were thus formally opened.

Austria-Hungary manifested great reluctance to enter upon the question of compensations, but Germany was more alert to its own concerns. Bülow was, therefore, entrusted with the temporary charge of the German embassy in Rome since the actual ambassador, Flotow, went on sick leave (19 December 1914). Bülow at once plunged into active negotiations and was sympathetic with Italian demands for compensation. He had, however, to fight the intransigence of Hungarian Prime Minister István Tisza, and Tisza&#x27;s nominee, who was Berchtold&#x27;s successor, Baron von Burian. Bülow was from the first for the complete cession of the Trentino region to Italy, but Austria-Hungary was willing to cede only part of it. Sonnino pointed out that Italian feeling would not be satisfied even with the whole of the Trentino but would also, in accordance with its irredentism, demand Trieste. Bülow continued to urge that all he could mediate for was the Trentino but that Austria would fight to keep Trieste.

In early April 1915, Italy&#x27;s secret negotiations demanded the Trentino, Trieste and the Curzolane Islands, off the coast of Dalmatia. Austria-Hungary recognised Italian sovereignty over Valona. However, negotiations dragged on until the middle of May, when Bülow made a grave but characteristic tactical mistake. He induced the former Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti to come to Rome from Turin in the hope of preventing a rupture and bringing about the acceptance of the Austro-Hungarian terms.

Prime Minister Antonio Salandra suddenly resigned. There was a great outburst of popular indignation, fanned by the impassioned eloquence of d&#x27;Annunzio and expressed in demonstrations in front of the Quirinal, the royal palace, and on the Capitoline Hill, the centre of Rome. After a great majority in the Italian Parliament had on 20 May supported Salandra, a general mobilisation was ordered on 22 May, and the formal declaration of war against Austria-Hungary followed on 23 May 1915. The next day, Bülow left Rome. He regarded his task as impossible in any case, and on returning, he remarked: &quot;Morale and attitude of the German people: A-1. Political leadership: Z-Minus&quot;.

===Considered for chancellorship===
He lived in Berlin, but after the peace he again resided in Rome for part of every year and spent the rest of the year in Germany. His name was mentioned in a ministerial crisis of 1921, as a possible chancellor. Although many of the leading figures in the Reichstag, including Matthias Erzberger, hoped that Bülow would succeed Bethmann Hollweg, who resigned in 1917, he was entirely unacceptable to the vast majority of both the German people and the Reichstag.

He died on 28 October 1929 in Rome.

==Personality==
Bülow spoke several languages and was a charming conversationalist. He was comfortably at home in high society and could entertain and impress even his opponents. He was thought by some colleagues to be untrustworthy: Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter referred to him as &quot;the Eel&quot;. Once he had obtained power and position in the German government, he had no overarching ideas of what to do with them, allowing others to guide policy. His character made him a good choice to work with Kaiser Wilhelm II, who required agreement and flattery from his senior ministers, even if they sometimes then ignored his instructions. He wrote four volumes of autobiography, to be published after his death, which markedly altered public perception of his character, as they included his candid and malicious descriptions of others. He was a fine debater in the Reichstag but was generally lazy in carrying out his duties. He was described by Friedrich von Holstein, who was for 30 years the first councillor in the foreign department and a major influence on policy throughout that time, as having &quot;read more Machiavelli than he could digest&quot;. His mother-in-law claimed, &quot;Bernhard makes a secret out of everything&quot;.

<doc id="430958" wikidata="Q831282" url="?curid=430958" title="Order of St. George">
<text>The Order of Saint George () is the highest military decoration of the Russian Federation. It was originally established on 26 November 1769 Julian (7 December 1769 Gregorian) as the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire for commissioned officers and generals by Empress Catherine the Great. After the October Revolution in 1917, it was awarded by the White movement under Alexander Kolchak until their collapse in 1921. The order was revived in the Russian Federation on 20 March 1992 by Decree No.1463 of the President of Russia. The current award criteria were amended on 7 September 2010 by Presidential Decree 1099.

== Statute of the Order of St. George ==
The current Order of Saint George is awarded to highest and senior military officers for the conduct of military operations to protect the Motherland from attack by an external enemy which resulted in the complete defeat of the enemy, for the execution of combat and other operations in other states aimed at restoring international peace and security, or for being a model of military science with feats that exemplify military prowess; the Order is also conferred upon officers who were previously awarded state awards of the Russian Federation for distinction in combat.

== Description ==
The Order of Saint George is divided into four classes, from the First Class to the Fourth class; the highest degree being the Order First class. The four classes are awarded sequentially from the fourth to the first. These four classes are individually identified by the size and manner of wearing the two principal insignia of the Order, the cross and the star.

Cross: A white enamelled cross pattée with a central medallion bearing the image of Saint George on horseback slaying the dragon. The cross measures 60mm across in the case of the Order first class and is worn on a sash in the colours of Saint George (orange and black). The same 60mm cross is worn around the neck on a 45mm wide ribbon also in the colours of Saint George for the Order second class. The cross is 50mm across for the Order third class and is also worn around the neck but from a 24mm wide ribbon in the same colours. The Order fourth class is a 40mm cross worn on the left breast hanging from a pentagonal mount covered with a 24mm wide ribbon of Saint George.

Star: A four-pointed silver gilt star with a gold central medallion bearing the cipher of Saint George &quot;SG&quot; topped by a crown and surrounded by a black enamelled band bearing the motto of the order &quot;For Service and Bravery&quot; (&quot;Za Sluzhbu i Khrabrost&quot;). The star is worn on the left breast for both the Order first and second classes.

Ribbon: The ribbon of the Order of Saint George is orange with three black stripes, commonly called &quot;George&#x27;s Ribbon&quot;. It symbolises fire and gunpowder: the Russian colours of military glory, and is also thought to be derived from the colours of the original Russian imperial coat of arms (black eagle on a golden background). It was subsequently associated with the colors of the Russian and Soviet Guard units.

<doc id="430961" wikidata="Q161084" url="?curid=430961" title="Georg von Hertling">
<text>Georg Friedrich Karl Freiherr von Hertling, from 1914 Count von Hertling, (31 August 1843 – 4 January 1919) was a German politician of the Catholic Centre Party. He was foreign minister and minister president of Bavaria, then imperial chancellor of the German Reich and minister president of Prussia from 1 November 1917 to 30 September 1918. He was the first party politician to hold the two offices; all the others were career civil servants or military men.

Hertling&#x27;s Catholicism played an important role in both his academic and political life. He belonged to the conservative wing of the Centre Party and resisted moves towards making the government dependent on the will of parliament rather than on the emperor, a stance that helped bring down his government in the final months of World War I.

== Education and non-political activities ==
Hertling came from a Catholic family of civil servants from the Grand Duchy of Hesse. He was born in Darmstadt, the son of the Hessian court councilor Jakob Freiherr von Hertling and his wife Antonie (née von Guaita).

The religious education he received through his mother made him consider becoming a priest. He attended the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium where he was a student under a principal who preserved the institute&#x27;s humanistic character against the emerging natural sciences. He then studied philosophy in Munich, Münster and Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1864.

He qualified at Bonn in 1867 to teach at the university level, but because he was a professing Catholic it was not until 1880 that he was appointed to an associate professorship. The delay was due to the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (culture struggle) taking place in Prussia between the government under Otto von Bismarck and the Catholic Church, primarily over issues of clerical control of education and ecclesiastical appointments. The experience contributed to Hertling taking a leading role in the 1876 founding of the Görres Society, a learned association for the cultivation of science in Catholic Germany. He remained its president until his death in 1919. Hertling received a full professorship at the University of Munich in 1882. Before that he published books on Aristotle in 1871 and Albertus Magnus in 1880.

Hertling was one of the pioneers of the movement for Catholic student fraternities. He joined the Catholic German Student Fraternity &quot;Aenania&quot; in Munich in 1862 and later the Catholic Student Association &quot;Arminia&quot; in Bonn. His speech at the 1863 Catholic Congress in Frankfurt, in which he presented religion, science, and friendship as the guiding principles of the Catholic fraternity student, is considered the catalyst for the founding of the Würzburg Federation, an association of Catholic student groups that still exists today as the .

Hertling was president of the German Society for Christian Art from its founding in 1893 until 1911.

He was married to Anna Freiin von Biegeleben (1845–1919), from an influential family of civil servants. The Hertlings had one son and five daughters, one of whom died young. Hertling was a great-nephew of the Romantic writer Bettina von Arnim and the poet Clemens Brentano. The actress Gila von Weitershausen (born 1944) is a great-granddaughter.

== Member of parliament and Bavarian minister president ==
From 1875 to 1890 and 1896 to 1912 Hertling was a member of the German Reichstag as a representative of the Catholic Centre Party. He devoted himself first to sociopolitical issues and later primarily to foreign and financial policy. From 1909 to 1912 he was chairman of the Centre&#x27;s parliamentary group, advocating the reconciliation of German Catholicism with the predominantly Protestant and Prussian-influenced national state. In 1891 Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria made him a , a life member of the House of Councillors (), the upper house of the Bavarian Landtag, or state parliament.

On 9 February 1912 the prince regent appointed Hertling chairman of the Bavarian Ministry of State and Bavarian foreign minister, i.e., as minister president, at which time the former regent, then King Ludwig III, also made him a count. The appointment of a representative of the majority party in the state parliament to the office of head of government was a first and indicated the beginning of Bavaria&#x27;s parliamentarization. Unlike his more liberal predecessor Clemens von Podewils-Dürniz, he had a secure parliamentary base and formed his own cabinet.

Social issues were among the most pressing problems in politics, and in 1913 the Bavarian government drew up plans to provide state support for the unemployed, but these failed in the upper chamber. As a result, demonstrations took place across Bavaria in early 1914.

After the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated in Sarajevo in June 1914, the situation in the Balkans did not come up as an issue at the meeting of the Bavarian Council of Ministers on 15 July. When the minister president of Württemberg, Karl von Weizsäcker, suggested that a Bundesrat committee be convened to find a common position for the smaller federal states, Munich waved it off.

During World War I, Hertling supported the policies of the independent Reich Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg. Frederick Augustus II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, as a spokesman for those who wanted Germany to annex foreign territory following a presumed victory in the war, suggested to the Bavarian King Ludwig III in March 1915 that he demand from Emperor Wilhelm II, on behalf of the German princes, the dismissal of Bethmann Hollweg, who in his opinion was too weak and stood in the way of a &quot;German peace&quot; – i.e., one with annexations. The King, who wanted to enlarge Bavaria after a victory, did not take the step because Hertling was able to prevent the initiative.

The simmering conflict between farmers and city dwellers caused by food shortages during the war was also played out between the parties in the Bavarian parliament and led to ministerial resignations in December 1916, although Hertling remained minister president. Bavaria&#x27;s social situation grew increasingly worse.

On 31 August 1916 the Supreme Army Command announced the Hindenburg Program developed by Erich Ludendorff and Paul von Hindenburg. It called for drastic measures to increase economic output. Its massive strengthening of imperial power was accompanied by a corresponding weakening of the federal states&#x27; ability to act politically.

After the fall of Bethmann Hollweg in July 1917, Hertling declined to assume the Reich chancellorship. Only after the failure of Bethmann&#x27;s successor Georg Michaelis did Hertling, who was 74 and physically frail, take over the offices of Reich chancellor and minister president of Prussia on 1 November 1917. He was the first party politician to hold the combined posts; all of his predecessors had been career civil servants or military men. It was initially planned to have Michaelis continue in office as Prussian minister president, but he did not have the necessary votes in parliament. In Bavaria Hertling was succeeded in office by the independent Otto von Dandl.

Hertling belonged to the right wing of the Centre Party, which in contrast to its left rejected parliamentarization – that is, having ministers responsible to parliament rather than the emperor. He also feared that it would undermine federalism and strengthen the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Under his Reich chancellorship, the direction of the Centre and of the left-liberal Progressive People&#x27;s Party, both of which wanted to show consideration for the special rights of the German states, prevailed. Nevertheless, Hertling&#x27;s government represented an important step towards the parliamentarization of the Reich, since the new chancellor had to reconcile his government program in advance with the majority parties of the Reichstag, the largest of which was the SPD with 35% of the seats, as compared to the Centre&#x27;s 16%. The Centre was thus given time to become accustomed to &quot;proto-parliamentary governance&quot; and cooperation with the SPD and the left liberals.

With the left-wing liberal Friedrich von Payer of the Progressive People&#x27;s Party as vice chancellor and Robert Friedberg of the National Liberal Party as deputy Prussian prime minister, two veteran parliamentarians were included in the cabinets as liaison men to the parties. The Social Democrats remained on the outside in order not to complicate the formation of a government. Friedrich von Payer was responsible for liaising between the SPD and the government.

During Hertling&#x27;s term in office, some important steps were taken toward parliamentarization and democratization, such as an envisaged electoral reform with elements of proportional representation. Overall, however, the SPD was dissatisfied with him because the influence of the Supreme Army Command remained strong and reforms were slow. By the end of September 1918, Hertling had lost the confidence of the SPD, which wanted to enter the government only under a change of policy. The governments of Bavaria and Baden also thought that Hertling was not the right man to develop a consistent peace policy. The Progressive People&#x27;s Party thought the same but did not want to endanger the coalition.

In view of the deteriorating military situation, the parties of the Inter-Party Committee, including Hertling&#x27;s Centre Party, called for negotiations for a separate peace with the Allies that would not include annexations, as well as for parliamentarization of the Reich. Through a constitutional amendment, the government was to be made dependent on the confidence of the Reichstag. Hertling was determined to resist these demands. On 26 September 1918, however, department heads in the General Staff informed Paul von Hintze, state secretary in the Foreign Ministry, of the hopeless military situation, bypassing Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff, but also failing to involve Reich Chancellor Hertling. Hintze worked out a concept for a revolution from above. When the Supreme Army Command also demanded a broader base for the government on 28 September – probably in order to place the responsibility for the defeat on the democratic parties – Hertling had no way out. The end of his chancellorship was sealed on 29 September at the army&#x27;s general headquarters in Spa, Belgium. Hertling was succeeded on 3 October by Prince Maximilian of Baden, the preferred candidate of his vice chancellor, Payer.

Georg von Hertling died three months later in his adopted home of Ruhpolding, Bavaria, where he was buried.

<text>Harvard Man is a 2001 American crime comedy-drama thriller film written and directed by James Toback, and starring Adrian Grenier, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joey Lauren Adams, Rebecca Gayheart, Ray Allen, and Eric Stoltz.

==Plot==
When his parents&#x27; house is destroyed in a tornado, Harvard student Alan Jensen, point guard for the Harvard men&#x27;s basketball team, is desperate for $100,000 to replace their home. He is approached by his girlfriend Cindy Bandolini, whose father is an organized crime boss. Cindy convinces Alan to throw a game for the money. She tells Alan that her father is behind the deal, but actually she goes to her father&#x27;s associate, Teddy Carter, and Carter&#x27;s assistant, Kelly Morgan for funding. What she does not know is that Carter and Morgan are undercover FBI agents.

Alan throws the game, gives his parents the money, and then undergoes a psychedelic experience after he ingests a 15,000 microgram dose of LSD, followed by a long stretch of the film during which morphing special effects demonstrate Alan&#x27;s altered state as he is pursued by Carter, while Cindy is collared by Morgan.

Just when it looks like a toss-up as to what will prove his downfall first, the bad trip, the FBI, or the mob, Alan&#x27;s other girlfriend, who is also his philosophy lecturer, Chesney Cort, saves the day. Not only does she get Alan to a doctor who can bring him back to sobriety, she reveals that she is in a sexual threesome with Carter and Morgan. Once he gets some photographic evidence for blackmail, Alan is extricated from his problems.

The ending implies that he may have hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, a chronic disorder in which a person has flashbacks of visual hallucinations, known as flashbacks, during a previous hallucinogenic drug experience. While taking a picture of a boy in the park, the boy&#x27;s face morphs and Alan hears echoes of past conversations as Sandy says, &quot;Sometimes it never ends&quot;. The little boy consoles Alan, telling him, &quot;everything&#x27;s okay&quot;. He responds, &quot;I hope you&#x27;re right&quot;. A close up is shown of his eyes dilated.

<doc id="430976" wikidata="Q844664" url="?curid=430976" title="Uncanny valley">
<text>The effect is a hypothesized psychological and aesthetic relation between an object&#x27;s degree of resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to the object. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts that an entity appearing almost human will risk eliciting eerie feelings in viewers. Examples of the phenomenon exist among robotics, 3D computer animations and lifelike dolls. The increasing prevalence of digital technologies (e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation) has propagated discussions and citations of the &quot;valley&quot;; such conversation has enhanced the construct&#x27;s verisimilitude. 

==Etymology==
As related to robotics engineering, robotics professor Masahiro Mori first introduced the concept in 1970 from his book titled , phrasing it as . &quot;Bukimi no tani&quot; was translated literally as &quot;uncanny valley&quot; in the 1978 book &quot;Robots: Fact, Fiction, and Prediction&quot; written by Jasia Reichardt. Over time, this translation created an unintended association of the concept to Ernst Jentsch&#x27;s psychoanalytic concept of the uncanny established in his 1906 essay &quot;On the Psychology of the Uncanny&quot; (), which was then critiqued and extended in Sigmund Freud&#x27;s 1919 essay &quot;The Uncanny&quot; ().

==Hypothesis==
Mori&#x27;s original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers&#x27; emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it becomes almost human, at which point the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot&#x27;s appearance continues to become less distinguishable from that of a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels. When plotted on a graph, the reactions are indicated by a steep decrease followed by a steep increase (hence the &quot;valley&quot; part of the name) in the areas where anthropomorphism is closest to reality.

This interval of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a &quot;somewhat human&quot; and &quot;fully human&quot; entity is the uncanny valley effect. The name represents the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly &quot;strange&quot; to some human beings, produces a feeling of uncanniness, and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive human–robot interaction.

==Theoretical basis==

A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism causing the phenomenon:
* &quot;Mate selection:&quot; Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved cognitive mechanism for the avoidance of selecting mates with low fertility, poor hormonal health, or ineffective immune systems based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.
* &quot;Mortality salience:&quot; Viewing an &quot;uncanny&quot; robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally supported defenses for coping with death&#x27;s inevitability... disassembled androids...play on subconscious fears of reduction, replacement, and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines. (2) Androids in various states of mutilation, decapitation, or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and, as such, serve as a reminder of our mortality. (3) Since most androids are copies of actual people, they are doppelgängers and may elicit a fear of being replaced, on the job, in a relationship, and so on. (4) The jerkiness of an android&#x27;s movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control.
* &quot;Pathogen avoidance:&quot; Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response. &quot;The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and other parasites increases with genetic similarity.&quot; The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals.
* &quot;Sorites paradoxes:&quot; Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric: degree of human likeness.
* &quot;Violation of human norms:&quot; If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics are noticeable, generating empathy. However, if the entity looks almost human, it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations. The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness. In other words, a robot which has an appearance in the uncanny valley range is not judged as a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but instead as an abnormal human doing a bad job at seeming like a normal person. This has been associated with perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding.
* &quot;Conflicting perceptual cues:&quot; The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations. Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to category membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features. This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., &quot;eeriness&quot;), much like the discomfort that is experienced with cognitive dissonance. Several studies support this possibility. Mathur and Reichling found that the time subjects took to gauge a robot face&#x27;s human- or mechanical-resemblance peaked for faces deepest in the uncanny valley, suggesting that perceptually classifying these faces as &quot;human&quot; or &quot;robot&quot; posed a greater cognitive challenge. However, they found that while perceptual confusion coincided with the uncanny valley, it did not mediate the effect of the uncanny valley on subjects&#x27; social and emotional reactions—suggesting that perceptual confusion may not be the mechanism behind the uncanny valley effect. Burleigh and colleagues demonstrated that faces at the midpoint between human and non-human stimuli produced a level of reported eeriness that diverged from an otherwise linear model relating human-likeness to affect. Yamada et al. found that cognitive difficulty was associated with negative affect at the midpoint of a morphed continuum (e.g., a series of stimuli morphing between a cartoon dog and a real dog). Ferrey et al. demonstrated that the midpoint between images on a continuum anchored by two stimulus categories produced a maximum of negative affect, and found this with both human and non-human entities. Schoenherr and Burleigh provide examples from history and culture that evidence an aversion to hybrid entities, such as the aversion to genetically modified organisms (&quot;Frankenfoods&quot;). Finally, Moore developed a Bayesian mathematical model that provides a quantitative account of perceptual conflict. There has been some debate as to the precise mechanisms that are responsible. It has been argued that the effect is driven by categorization difficulty, configural processing, perceptual mismatch, frequency-based sensitization, and inhibitory devaluation.
* &quot;Threat to humans&#x27; distinctiveness and identity:&quot; Negative reactions toward very humanlike robots can be related to the challenge that this kind of robot leads to the categorical human – non-human distinction. Kaplan stated that these new machines challenge human uniqueness, pushing for a redefinition of humanness. Ferrari, Paladino and Jetten found that the increase of anthropomorphic appearance of a robot leads to an enhancement of threat to the human distinctiveness and identity. The more a robot resembles a real person, the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings.
* &quot;Religious definition of human identity:&quot; The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity. An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist Irvin Yalom. Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death. One of these defenses is &#x27;specialness&#x27;, the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself. The experience of the very humanlike &quot;living&quot; robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans&#x27; notions of &quot;specialness&quot; and existential defenses, eliciting existential anxiety. In folklore, the creation of human-like, but soulless, beings is often shown to be unwise, as with the golem in Judaism, whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster, however good the intentions of its creator.
* &quot;Uncanny valley of the mind or AI:&quot; Due to rapid advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence and affective computing, cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an &quot;uncanny valley of mind&quot;. Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology. Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research.

===Research===

A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces. Mathur MB &amp; Reichling DB used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed an investment game to measure indirectly how much money they were willing to &quot;wager&quot; on a robot&#x27;s trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.

One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey&#x27;s face. The monkeys&#x27; eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can result in less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin.

, researchers at University of California, San Diego and California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology were measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley. In one study using fMRI, a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in parietal cortex, on both sides of the brain, specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain&#x27;s visual cortex that processes bodily movements with the section of the motor cortex thought to contain mirror neurons. The researchers say they saw, in essence, evidence of mismatch or perceptual conflict. The brain &quot;lit up&quot; when the human-like appearance of the android and its robotic motion &quot;didn&#x27;t compute&quot;. Ayşe Pınar Saygın, an assistant professor from UCSD, stated that &quot;The brain doesn&#x27;t seem selectively tuned to either biological appearance or biological motion per se. What it seems to be doing is looking for its expectations to be met – for appearance and motion to be congruent.&quot;

Viewer perception of facial expression and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic, human-like characters intended for video games and movies is being investigated by Tinwell et al., 2011. Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al. (2010) as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games. Building on the body of work already performed for android science, this research intends to build a conceptual mapping of the uncanny valley using 3D characters generated in a real-time gaming engine. The goal is to analyze how cross-modal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny. Tinwell et al., 2011 have also introduced the notion of an &#x27;unscalable&#x27; uncanny wall that suggests that a viewer&#x27;s discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism. A summary of Angela Tinwell&#x27;s research on the uncanny valley, psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in human-like virtual characters is provided in her book, &quot;The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation&quot; by CRC Press.

Studies in 2015 and 2018 observed that autistic individuals were less affected by the uncanny valley, and autistic children even not at all. The suspected causes were their reduced sensibility for subtle facial changes and limited visual experiences due to diminished social motivation. In return, the social ostracism of autistics may be caused by the uncanny valley effect in the non-autistic society. The effort of autistic individuals to appear normal may thereby be misinterpreted as normal people behaving atypically &quot;creepy&quot;. Outing or improved masking may help autistic individuals in such cases.

==Design principles==
A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:
* Design elements should match in human realism. A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed. For example, both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice. For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior. If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression. Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.
* Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability. In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it. A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics. This likely operates at a sub-conscious level and may have a biological basis. Neuroscientists have noted &quot;when the brain&#x27;s expectations are not met, the brain...generates a &#x27;prediction error&#x27;. As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners. Or perhaps, we will decide &#x27;it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all&#x27;.&quot;
* Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together. A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions, or the computer generated character can result in the uncanny valley. Abnormal facial proportions, including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (e.g., larger eyes), can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture.

==Criticism==
A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:
* The uncanny valley effect is a group of phenomena. Phenomena considered as exhibiting the uncanny valley effect can be diverse, involve different sense modalities, and have multiple, possibly overlapping causes. People&#x27;s cultural heritage may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley.
* The uncanny valley effect may be generational. Younger generations, more used to computer-generated imagery (CGI), robots, and such, may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue.
* The uncanny valley effect is simply a specific case of information processing such as categorization and frequency-based effects. In contrast to the assumption that the uncanny valley is based on a heterogeneous group of phenomena, recent arguments have suggested that uncanny valley-like phenomena simply represent the products of information processing such as categorization. Cheetham et al. have argued that the uncanny valley effect can be understood in terms of categorization processes, with a category boundary defining &#x27;the valley&#x27;. Extending this argument, Burleigh and Schoenherr suggested that the effects associated with the uncanny valley can be divided into those attributable to the category boundary and individual exemplar frequency. Namely, the negative affective responses attributed to the uncanny valley were simply a result of the frequency of exposure, similar to the mere-exposure effect. By varying the frequency of training items, they were able to demonstrate a dissociation between cognitive uncertainty based on the category boundary and affective uncertainty based on the frequency of training exemplars. In a follow-up study, Schoenherr and Burleigh demonstrated that an instructional manipulation affected categorization accuracy but not ratings of negative affect. Thus, generational effects and cultural artifacts can be accounted for with basic information processing mechanisms. These and related findings have been used to argue that the uncanny valley is merely an artifact of having greater familiarity with members of human categories and does not reflect a unique phenomenon.
* The uncanny valley effect occurs at any degree of human likeness. Hanson has also stated that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (e.g., MIT&#x27;s robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (e.g., cosmetically atypical people). Capgras delusion is a relatively rare condition in which the patient believes that people (or, in some cases, things) have been replaced with duplicates. These duplicates are accepted rationally as identical in physical properties, but the irrational belief is held that the &quot;true&quot; entity has been replaced with something else. Some people with Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot. Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition, which results in conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense. This supports the opinion that the uncanny valley effect could occur due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to how the brain processes information.
* Good design can avoid the uncanny valley effect. David Hanson has criticized Mori&#x27;s hypothesis that entities having an almost human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively. He has shown that the uncanny valley effect could be eliminated by adding neotenous, cartoonish features to entities that had formerly caused an uncanny valley effect. This method incorporates the idea that humans find characteristics appealing when they are reminiscent of the young of our own (as well as many other) species, as used in cartoons.

==Similar effects==
If the uncanny valley effect is the result of general cognitive processes, there should be evidence in evolutionary history and cultural artifacts. An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in 1839:

A similar &quot;uncanny valley&quot; effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with transhuman enhancements (cf. body modification), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it eyesight, muscle strength, or cognition. So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior, a negative reaction is unlikely, but once individuals supplant normal human variety, revulsion can be expected. However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, &quot;transhuman&quot; individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed &quot;posthuman&quot;), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley. Another example comes from &quot;pageant retouching&quot; photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like.

==In visual effects==
A number of movies that use computer-generated imagery to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or &quot;creepiness&quot; as a result of the characters looking too realistic. Examples include the following:

* According to roboticist Dario Floreano, the baby character Billy in Pixar&#x27;s groundbreaking 1988 animated short movie &quot;Tin Toy&quot; provoked negative audience reactions, which first caused the movie industry to consider the concept of the uncanny valley seriously.
* The 2001 movie &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, one of the first photorealistic computer-animated feature movies, provoked negative reactions from some viewers due to its near-realistic yet imperfect visual depictions of human characters. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Peter Bradshaw stated that while the movie&#x27;s animation is brilliant, the &quot;solemnly realist human faces look shriekingly phoney precisely because they&#x27;re almost there but not quite&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Peter Travers wrote of the movie, &quot;At first it&#x27;s fun to watch the characters, [...] But then you notice a coldness in the eyes, a mechanical quality in the movements&quot;.
* Several reviewers of the 2004 animated movie &quot;The Polar Express&quot; termed its animation eerie. CNN.com reviewer Paul Clinton wrote, &quot;Those human characters in the film come across as downright... well, creepy. So &quot;The Polar Express&quot; is at best disconcerting, and at worst, a wee bit horrifying&quot;. The term &quot;eerie&quot; was used by reviewers Kurt Loder and Manohla Dargis, among others. &quot;Newsday&quot; reviewer John Anderson called the movie&#x27;s characters &quot;creepy&quot; and &quot;dead-eyed&quot;, and wrote that &quot;The Polar Express is a zombie train&quot;. Animation director Ward Jenkins wrote an online analysis describing how changes to the &quot;Polar Express&quot; characters&#x27; appearance, especially to their eyes and eyebrows, could have avoided what he considered a feeling of deadness in their faces.
* In a review of the 2007 animated movie &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot; technology writer David Gallagher wrote that the movie failed the uncanny valley test, stating that the movie&#x27;s villain, the monster Grendel, was &quot;only slightly scarier&quot; than the &quot;closeups of our hero Beowulf&#x27;s face... allowing viewers to admire every hair in his 3-D digital stubble&quot;.
* Some reviewers of the 2009 animated film &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; criticized its animation as creepy. Joe Neumaier of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said of the movie, &quot;The motion-capture does no favors to co-stars [Gary] Oldman, Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn, since, as in &#x27;Polar Express,&#x27; the animated eyes never seem to focus. And for all the photorealism, when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons, it&#x27;s off-putting&quot;. Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon.com wrote of the film, &quot;In the center of the action is Jim Carrey -- or at least a dead-eyed, doll-like version of Carrey&quot;.
* The 2011 animated movie &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot; was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation. The movie was among the biggest box office bombs in history, which may have been due in part to audience revulsion. (&quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot; was produced by Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s production company, ImageMovers, which had previously produced &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.)
* Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated movie &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was affected by the uncanny valley effect. Daniel D. Snyder of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote, &quot;Instead of trying to bring to life Herge&#x27;s beautiful artwork, Spielberg and co. have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motion-capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends. Tintin&#x27;s original face, while barebones, never suffered for a lack of expression. It&#x27;s now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage, his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles.&quot; He added, &quot;In bringing them to life, Spielberg has made the characters dead.&quot;. N.B. of &quot;The Economist&quot; termed elements of the animation &quot;grotesque&quot;, writing, &quot;Tintin, Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo-realistic, and nearly all of their features are those of flesh-and-blood people. And yet they still have the sausage fingers and distended noses of comic-strip characters. It&#x27;s not so much &#x27;The Secret of the Unicorn&#x27; as &#x27;The Invasion of the Body Snatchers&#x27;&quot;. However, other reviewers felt that the movie avoided the uncanny valley effect despite its animated characters&#x27; realism. Critic Dana Stevens of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote, &quot;With the possible exception of the title character, the animated cast of Tintin narrowly escapes entrapment in the so-called &#x27;uncanny valley&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine editor Kevin Kelly wrote of the movie, &quot;we have passed beyond the uncanny valley into the plains of hyperreality&quot;.
* In 2014, the titular protagonist of the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; got a redesign which was described by some as &quot;creepy&quot;.
* In the French movie &quot;Animal Kingdom: Let&#x27;s Go Ape&quot; it uses motion capture, the apes were criticized for looking creepy. As this review points out, they have &quot;weirdly humanoid figures&quot; and &quot;recognisably human faces&quot;.
* The 2019 film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, a remake of the 1994 film that featured photo-realistic digital animals instead of the earlier movie&#x27;s more traditional animation, divided critics about the effectiveness of its imagery. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the images were so realistic that &quot;2019 might best be remembered as the summer we left the Uncanny Valley for good&quot;. However, other critics felt that the realism of the animals and setting rendered the scenes where the characters sing and dance disturbing and &quot;weird&quot;.
* The 2020 movie &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was delayed for three months to make the title character&#x27;s appearance less human-like and more cartoonish, after an extremely negative audience reaction to the movie&#x27;s first trailer.
* Multiple commentators cited the CGI half-human half-cat characters in the 2019 movie &quot;Cats&quot; as an example of the uncanny valley effect, first after the release of the trailer for the movie and then after the movie&#x27;s actual release.
* In the 2022 Disney animated movie &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, the uncanny valley is mentioned when the animated duo visits a place where several realistic CGI characters, including a &quot;Cats&quot; cameo from the 2019 movie, are inhabitants.
* In the 2022 Disney+ series &quot;She-Hulk: Attorney at Law&quot;, the appearance of the main character, She-Hulk, who is depicted via CGI, was criticized by some reviewers as suffering from the uncanny valley effect, and negatively compared to the appearance of the Hulk in the same series.

===Virtual actors===
An increasingly common practice is to feature virtual actors in movies: CGI likenesses of real actors used because the original actor either looks too old for the part or is deceased. Sometimes a virtual actor is created with involvement from the original actor (who may contribute motion capture, audio, etc.), while at other times the actor has no involvement. Reviewers have often criticized the use of virtual actors for its uncanny valley effect, saying it adds an eerie feeling to the movie. Examples of virtual actors that have received such criticism include replicas of Arnold Schwarzenegger in &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009) and &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015), Jeff Bridges in &quot;&quot; (2010), Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), and Will Smith in &quot;Gemini Man&quot; (2019).

<text>A protest vote (also called a blank, null, spoiled, or &quot;none of the above&quot; vote) is a vote cast in an election to demonstrate dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates or the current political system. Protest voting takes a variety of forms and reflects numerous voter motivations, including political apathy. Where voting is compulsory, casting a blank vote is available for those who do not wish to choose a candidate, or to protest. Unlike abstention elsewhere, blank votes are counted.

Along with abstention, or not voting, protest voting is a sign of unhappiness with available options. If protest vote takes the form of a blank vote, it may or may not be tallied into final results. Protest votes may be considered spoiled or, depending on the electoral system, counted as &quot;none of the above&quot; votes.

== Types of protest vote ==

Protest votes can take many different forms:

* Blank ballots
* Null ballots
* Spoiled ballots
* None of the above votes
* Votes for a fringe candidate or party, or a less preferred candidate or party
* Organized protest votes
* Declined ballots

Protest voting tends to occur among voters who feel alienated but who have an alternative voting option, such as a third-party candidate in the United States, or who can register their displeasure with the political process by reducing the majority status of a likely winner. Alienation often leads to abstention from voting, but can also generate participation in the form of a protest vote. In the 1992 United States presidential election, for example, 14% of those who voted for Ross Perot said they would not have voted at all if he had not run.

Protest votes can take the form of blank, null, or spoiled ballots. Blank ballots are ballots with no markings on them. Null ballots are ballots that do not result in a valid vote because the ballot was filled out incompletely or incorrectly. Spoiled ballots are ballots that have been defaced, crossed-out, or otherwise marked in a way that makes the ballot ineligible; spoiled ballots most clearly indicate the presence of a protest vote. Write-in votes may also indicate protest voting; in the United States Mickey Mouse has historically been a popular choice.

Declined ballots occur where a voter shows up to the polling place, and declines to vote. This is an option in multiple Canadian provinces, including Ontario. However, this option does not exist in federal elections. To decline a ballot, one may return the ballot to the poll worker while stating that they decline to vote.

None of the above (NOTA) voting is rarely an option in U.S. politics, although it has been an option on Nevada ballots since 1976. NOTA voting is proposed as a state-legitimized method of allowing voters to signal discontent, although selecting a &quot;none&quot; option does not always indicate protest.

Other types of protest voting relate more to the choice of candidate or party selected for a valid vote than the ballot itself. Voting for a fringe candidate or less preferred party can be a way of signaling dissatisfaction with a leading candidate, party, or policy, or of reducing the margin of victory of the likely winner.

Protest voting organized by political parties or leaders also occurs, but tends to be rare and associated with extreme circumstances.

== Determining the presence of a protest vote ==

Distinguishing between ballots that have been deliberately cast as protest votes and those that are blank, null, or spoiled by an individual trying but failing to cast a valid vote is challenging. Blank votes are often associated with protest voting, but can also be indicators of a lack of information. Votes are blank, null, and spoiled more frequently in areas with high levels of illiteracy or limited language competency. Spoiled ballots, especially those that have been deliberately defaced or otherwise ruined, are a more reliable indicator of protest votes and of political sophistication.

== Significant protest vote events ==

One United States court case determined that voting is not an issue of free speech or expression, but rather about electing officials; in &quot;Burdick v. Takushi, 1992&quot;, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on write-in votes after Alan B. Burdick argued that Hawaii should be required to count his protest vote for Donald Duck.

In the parliamentary elections in Finland and Sweden, voters have also used Donald Duck as a protest vote. In Ukraine, the Internet Party nominated Darth Vader for mayoral elections in Kyiv and Odesa, and tried to nominate Darth Vader for presidency, although this application was rejected.

Protest voting is common in Latin America, where over 5.5% of ballots in presidential elections since 1980 have been blank or spoiled. During the 2000 presidential elections in Peru, candidate Alejandro Toledo withdrew over concerns about election integrity and encouraged his supporters to spoil their ballots as protest—an example of organized protest voting. In that election, around 31% of ballots cast were spoiled or blank.

After the 2002 French presidential election, in which far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen arrived second behind conservative candidate Jacques Chirac, protest vote was named a contributing factor. The 2017 French presidential election, won by Emmanuel Macron, saw the highest level of protest voting and abstention in France since the late 1960s, with 4 million blank or spoiled ballots and an additional 12 million abstentions.

In Colombia, the blank vote has a legal path to force a repetition of an election and a change of the candidates in that election. According to the paragraph 1 of the article 258 of the Political Constitution of Colombia, if the blank vote in Colombia becomes the most voted option, the elections should be repeated once and, depending on the nature of the election, the parties should present new candidates or new lists of candidates. This gives the protest vote a way to express dissent with real electoral consequences. So far, the blank vote has not been majoritarian in presidential or congress elections in Colombia, but it already has forced to repeat some elections for mayor&#x27;s office.

In certain parts of the United States, especially in the South, protest candidates often receive a large number of votes in Democratic Party presidential primaries due to a large presence of conservative Democrats who, while registered Democrats, often vote Republican at the federal level. This phenomenon received significant attention in the 2012 Democratic primaries, where attorney John Wolfe Jr. polled at 42% against incumbent President Barack Obama in the Arkansas primary, and prisoner Keith Judd received 41% in West Virginia. In Oklahoma, non-Obama candidates gathered a combined total of 43%, with the highest number of votes going to anti-abortion activist Randall Terry. The phenomenon showed up in later elections but on a smaller scale (as many former Democrats left the party). In the 2016 West Virginia Democratic primary, favorite son Paul T. Farrell Jr. received 9% of the vote and placed ahead of eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in one county. In the 2020 primary in that state, fellow favorite son David Rice received a similar 8%.

During the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries, a significant protest vote movement formed against Biden&#x27;s support of Israel during the Israel–Hamas war.

In the 2024 Russian presidential election, amid the exclusion of anti-war candidates from challenging incumbent President Vladimir Putin, anti-Putin activists employed the protest voting tactic known as Noon Against Putin, first proposed by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny before his death. This involved gathering at polling stations on the last day of voting around midday to advocate for spoilt ballots such as writing Navalny&#x27;s name or to cast votes for New People candidate Vladislav Davankov. While perceived as aligned with the Kremlin, Davankov incorporated anti-war sentiments reminiscent of the barred candidates, rendering him an alternative candidate to opposition voters as a means of protest voting. Despite the action, Davankov nevertheless received officially only 4% of the official vote, while independent exit polling conducted showed him overwhelmingly defeating Putin.

== Protest vote and abstention == 
Abstention may be a type of protest vote when it is not solely the result of political apathy or indifference towards politics. In systems where voting is compulsory, abstention may be an act of political disappointment. The anarchist movement rejects representative democracy in favor of a more direct form of government and has historically called for abstention as a form of protest. Active protest voting, whether through spoiled or blank ballots, tends to communicate dissatisfaction more effectively than abstention.

Abstaining increases the proportion of votes for the most popular candidate or party, while using a protest vote against the popular candidate or party can shrink a margin of victory. Reducing the margin may result in a hung parliament or a smaller difference between the parties in government, thus limiting the chance a single party will have control over the system.

<text>The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a Chinese breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens have only four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm and friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens have been bred to have a wide variety of colors which include but are not limited to: Black, Blue, Buff, Partridge, Splash, White, Lavender, Paint and Porcelain.

==History==
It is unknown exactly where or when these fowl with their singular combination of attributes first appeared, but the most well documented point of origin is ancient China. Other places in Southeast Asia have been named as possibilities, such as India and Java. The earliest surviving Western written account of Silkies comes from Marco Polo, who wrote of a &quot;furry&quot; chicken in the 13th century during his travels in Asia. In 1598, Ulisse Aldrovandi, a writer and naturalist at the University of Bologna, Italy, published a comprehensive treatise on chickens which is still read and admired today. In it, he mentions &quot;wool-bearing chickens&quot; and ones &quot;clothed with hair like that of a black cat&quot;.

Silkies most likely made their way to the West via the Silk Route and maritime trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became more common in the West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.

In the 21st century, Silkies are one of the most popular and ubiquitous ornamental breeds of chicken. They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers, and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like ducks, geese and game birds such as quail and pheasants.

==Characteristics==
Silkies are considered a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only , and females weighing . The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are , and females that are .

Silkie plumage was once unique among chicken breeds, however in recent years silkie feathering has been developed in several breeds, mostly notably the Chabo, where it is now standardised in Britain and the Netherlands. It has been compared to silk, and to fur. The overall result is a soft, fluffy appearance. Their feathers lack functioning barbicels, and are thus similar to down on other birds. This characteristic leaves Silkies unable to fly.

Silkies appear in two distinct varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies have an extra muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, splash, lavender, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, mottled, chocolate, mauve, mille fleur, and red, are in various stages of development and/or awaiting official recognition. The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-shaped comb, dark wattles, and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, Houdan, and Sultan.

All Silkies have black or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; they are in the group of Chinese fowls known by the Chinese language name of &quot;wu gu ji&quot; (烏骨雞), meaning &#x27;black-boned chicken&#x27;. More specifically, the Silkie breed itself is named &quot;Taihe wu ji (&quot;泰和乌鸡), &#x27;black-boned chicken from Taihe&#x27;. Other &quot;wu gu ji&quot; may not share characteristics of the Taihe breed, such as the mulberry comb, white fur, blue ears, and polydactyly.

Melanism which extends beyond the skin into an animal&#x27;s connective tissue is a rare trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation. Disregarding color, the breed does not generally produce as much as the more common meat breeds of chicken.

===Bantams===

In the &quot;American Standard of Perfection&quot;, the standard male weight for the bantam Silkie is and for the female, . The &quot;Australian Poultry Standard&quot; and &quot;British Poultry Standard&quot; call for Silkie bantams much smaller; in the Australian, the standard weights are 680 g (25 oz) for males and 570 g (20 oz) for females. The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22 oz) for males, and 500 g for females (18 oz).

===Polydactyly===

Silkies are also known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an additional 1–2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation has been shown to be a SNP in a regulator of the &quot;SHH&quot; gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic &quot;SHH&quot; expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. While the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic &quot;FGF4&quot; expression in the AER, with ectopic &quot;SHH&quot; a secondary effect.

==Use==

Silkies lay a fair number of eggs, ranging from white to cream or light tan, but production is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody. A silkie hen can produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds.

==In cuisine==
The black meat of a Silkie is generally considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines. In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. Chinese cuisine especially values the breed, but it is also a common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has a strong influence, such as Malaysia, may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food. The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth, braising, and in curries. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries, &quot;Dioscorea polystachya&quot; (mountain yam), aged dried citrus peel, and fresh ginger. A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine, such as in confit.

<doc id="430985" wikidata="Q13534617" url="?curid=430985" title="Immaculate Reception">
<text>The Immaculate Reception is one of the most famous plays in the history of American football. It was a walk-off touchdown which occurred in the AFC divisional playoff game of the National Football League (NFL), between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 23, 1972. 

With his team trailing 7-6, on fourth down with 22 seconds left in the game, Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass targeting Steelers running back John Fuqua. The ball bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum. Steelers fullback Franco Harris caught it just before it hit the ground and ran for a game-winning touchdown. The play has been a source of some controversy and speculation ever since, with some contending that the ball touched only Fuqua (and did not in any way touch Tatum) or that it hit the ground before Harris caught it, either of which would have resulted in an incomplete pass by the rules of the time. Kevin Cook&#x27;s &quot;The Last Headbangers&quot; cites the play as the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Pittsburgh and Oakland that fueled a historically brutal Raiders team during the NFL&#x27;s most controversially physical era.

NFL Films has chosen the Immaculate Reception as the greatest play of all time, as well as the most controversial. The play was also selected as the Greatest Play in NFL History in the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;100&quot; series. The play proved to be a turning point for the Steelers, reversing four decades of futility with their first playoff win ever; they went on to win four Super Bowls by the end of the 1970s.

The play&#x27;s name is a pun derived from the Immaculate Conception, a dogma in the Roman Catholic Church. The phrase was first used on air by Myron Cope, a Pittsburgh sportscaster who was reporting on the Steelers&#x27; victory. A Pittsburgh woman, Sharon Levosky, called Cope before his 11:00p.m. sports broadcast that night and suggested the name, which was coined by her then-boyfriend Michael Ord during a celebration at a local bar after the two attended the game in person. Cope used the term on television and the phrase stuck. The phrase was apparently meant to imply that the play was miraculous in nature (see Hail Mary pass for a similar term).

==Background==
===Playoff history===
The Oakland Raiders had been to the postseason four previous times. In 1967 they won the AFL Championship before losing Super Bowl II against the Green Bay Packers. The following three seasons they made it back to the playoffs but lost to the eventual champions in all three instances (New York Jets in 1968, Kansas City Chiefs in 1969, Baltimore Colts in 1970). The &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; game thus marked their return to the postseason after missing out on a playoff berth the year before.

The Pittsburgh Steelers, on the other hand, had appeared in the postseason only once, losing against the Philadelphia Eagles, 21–0, in an NFL divisional playoff game on December 21, 1947. The Steelers&#x27; fortunes began to change, however, in 1969, when they hired head coach Chuck Noll, who won four Super Bowls in six years with the team between the 1974 and 1979 seasons. That streak began two years after the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; game.

===1972 season===
The 1972 season marked the third year after the AFL-NFL merger, which had the Steelers move to the newly formed American Football &quot;Conference&quot; despite not having been a member of the American Football &quot;League&quot;. Thus, this was the third year in which a playoff meeting between the Raiders and the Steelers could take place outside a Super Bowl.

Having missed the playoffs the year before, the two teams met in the opening game of the season (on September 17), which Pittsburgh won, 34–28. In that game, the Steelers took leads of 17–0 and 27–7 on a blocked-punt return touchdown and two rushing touchdowns by quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Oakland fought back with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including a 70-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Daryle Lamonica to wide receiver Mike Siani, but Pittsburgh prevailed.

Both teams won their respective divisions. Pittsburgh&#x27;s 11–3 record put them one game over the Cleveland Browns, who earned the AFC&#x27;s wild card spot, and Oakland&#x27;s mark of 10–3–1 ousted the Kansas City Chiefs by 2½ games. Until 1975 the home teams in the playoffs were two of the three division champions decided based on a yearly divisional rotation. The Miami Dolphins hosted the wild card team in the first round of the playoffs, which set up the matchup between Pittsburgh and Oakland.

== Game synopsis ==
The teams played to a scoreless tie at halftime, with Oakland&#x27;s longest gain coming on an 11 completion from Daryle Lamonica to Fred Biletnikoff. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, came fairly close to a scoring chance, but passed up on a field goal attempt from the Oakland 31 line. Instead, Steelers running back John Fuqua was stopped by Raiders safety Jack Tatum on a fourth-and-2 run to turn possession over to the Raiders. On its first possession of the second half, however, Pittsburgh opted for a field goal, with placekicker Roy Gerela&#x27;s successful 18-yard attempt accounting for the first score of the game.

Later in the third quarter, Lamonica was intercepted for the second time in the game both times by a Steelers linebacker (Andy Russell in the first quarter, Jack Ham in the third). Lamonica&#x27;s latest turnover prompted Raiders head coach John Madden to put Ken Stabler into the game at quarterback.

After an interception thrown by Bradshaw in Oakland territory the Steelers&#x27; only turnover of the game Stabler turned the ball back over to Pittsburgh, when he fumbled the ball inside the Oakland 25-yard line. This led to another field goal by Gerela to extend the Steelers&#x27; lead to 6–0. Stabler, however, successfully led Oakland down the field, when he capped a fourth-quarter drive with a 30-yard touchdown run. The ensuing extra point by placekicker George Blanda gave Oakland a 7–6 lead with 1:17 left, setting up the dramatic ending to the game.

== Events of the play ==

Trailing Oakland 7–6, the Steelers faced fourth-and-10 on their own 40-yard line with 22 seconds remaining in the game and no timeouts. Head coach Chuck Noll called a pass play, 66 Circle Option, intended for receiver Barry Pearson, a rookie who was playing in his first NFL game.

Bradshaw (1 in diagram) dropped back and, under great pressure from Raiders linemen Tony Cline and Horace Jones, scrambled to his right and threw the ball from his 29-yard line to the Raiders&#x27; 34-yard line, toward Fuqua. Raiders safety Tatum collided with Fuqua just as the ball arrived (2). Tatum&#x27;s hit knocked Fuqua to the ground and sent the ball sailing backward several yards, end over end.

Steelers fullback Franco Harris, after initially blocking on the play, had run downfield in case Bradshaw needed another eligible receiver. After Bradshaw threw the pass towards Fuqua, Harris recounted the advice of his college football coach Joe Paterno, who always told his players, &quot;Go to the ball.&quot; Harris, in the vicinity of the deflected pass, scooped up the sailing ball at the Oakland 44-yard line, just before it hit the ground (3). Harris ran past Raiders linebacker Gerald Irons, while linebacker Phil Villapiano, who had been covering Harris, was blocked by Steelers tight end John McMakin (4). Harris used a stiff arm to ward off Raiders defensive back Jimmy Warren (5) and went in for a touchdown. The touchdown gave the Steelers a 13–7 lead when Gerela added the ensuing extra point. 

== Referee call ==

After the play, a critical question remained: who did the football touch in the Fuqua/Tatum collision? If it bounced off Fuqua without ever touching Tatum, then Harris&#x27; reception was illegal. If the ball bounced off only Tatum or if it bounced off both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order) then the reception was legal. The rule stated in the pertinent part that if an offensive player touches a pass first, he is the only offensive player eligible to catch the pass. &quot;However, if a [defensive] player touches [the] pass first, or simultaneously with or subsequent to its having been touched by only one [offensive] player then all [offensive] players become and remain eligible&quot; to catch the pass. (This rule was rescinded in 1978.) If the reception was illegal, the Raiders would have gained possession (by a turnover on downs), clinching the victory.

One official, back judge Adrian Burk, signaled that the play was a touchdown but the other game officials did not immediately make any signal. When the officials huddled, Burk and another official, umpire Pat Harder, thought the play was a touchdown because Tatum and Fuqua had both touched the ball, while three others said that they were not in a position to rule. 

Referee Fred Swearingen approached Steelers sideline official Jim Boston and asked to be taken to a telephone. Boston took Swearingen to a baseball dugout in the stadium. There was a video monitor in the dugout but it was not used by Swearingen. (Bradshaw&#x27;s assertion that a special television was rigged up on the sideline so that Swearingen could watch the replay is not supported by other accounts.) From the dugout telephone, Boston put in a call to the press box to reach the NFL&#x27;s supervisor of officials, Art McNally. Before the call, McNally had &quot;an opinion from the get-go&quot; that the ball had hit Tatum&#x27;s chest, which he confirmed by looking &quot;at one shot on instant replay&quot;. In the press box the telephone was answered either by Dan Rooney, son of Steelers owner Art Rooney, or by Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon (reports vary) and McNally was put on the line. According to McNally, Swearingen &quot;never asked me about the rule and never asked what I saw. All he said was, &#x27;Two of my men say that opposing players touched the ball.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Everything&#x27;s fine then, go ahead.&#x27;&quot; After Swearingen hung up the phone Boston asked, &quot;What do we got?&quot; &quot;We got a touchdown,&quot; answered Swearingen, who then went back onto the field to signal the ruling to the crowd. 

Harris crossed the goal line at approximately 3:29 PM EST. Fans immediately rushed the field; it took fifteen minutes to clear them so the extra point could be kicked to give the Steelers what turned out to be their final margin of victory, 13–7. Although this has been described as the first known use of television replay to confirm a call (there was no instant replay review then), at the time the NFL denied that the decision was made in the press box or using a television replay. An &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; article two days after the game reported that Gordon told reporters in the press box that the decision had been made using the replay. Gordon has dismissed this as &quot;a total fabrication&quot;. NFL officials Jim Kensil and Val Pinchbeck, who were in the press box with McNally, also deny that replay was used in making the decision on the play.

In various NFL Films productions about the play years later, various Raiders have theorized that the real purpose of Swearingen&#x27;s phone conversation was to see if there were enough police on hand to ensure the players&#x27; safety if the play was ruled incomplete. The theory claims there were too few police so the play was called for the Steelers out of fear. In one of the films, McNally laughs at the suggestion.

The play is still disputed by those involved, particularly by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum said that the ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating that he could not honestly say whether or not the ball hit him. Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what happened that day but will never tell. Villapiano has also stated that he was illegally blocked by McMakin as he was pursuing Harris following the reception and he would have tackled Harris without it. Raiders coach Madden echoed this complaint. According to Raiders defensive back George Atkinson, the play is known by the Raiders and their fans as the &quot;Immaculate Deception&quot; because &quot;the public was deceived, the officials were deceived, and we got deceived.&quot;

John Madden, coach of the 1972 Raiders, maintained (until his death) that he would never get over the play, and has indicated that he was bothered more by the delay between the end of the play and the final call than by which player the ball actually hit. After the game, he said that from his view the football had indeed touched Tatum. A few days later, however, Madden indicated that the Raiders&#x27; game films showed that the ball hit Fuqua&#x27;s shoulder pads, Tatum conceded that &quot;even after we viewed the game films with stop action, nobody could tell who the ball hit on that moment of impact.&quot; Years later Madden wrote, &quot;No matter how many times I watch the films of the &#x27;immaculate reception&#x27; play, I never know for sure what happened.&quot;

In 1998, during halftime of the AFC Championship Game, NBC showed a replay from its original broadcast. The replay presented a different angle than the NFL Films clip that is most often shown. According to a writer for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;NBC&#x27;s replay showed the ball clearly hit one and only one man[:] Oakland DB Jack Tatum.&quot; Curt Gowdy, doing the live television play-by-play, called it as having been deflected by Tatum, and reiterated that during the video replay.

Pittsburgh sportscaster Myron Cope, in a 1997 &quot;New York Times&quot; article and in his 2002 book &quot;Quintuple Yoi!&quot;, related that two days after the game he reviewed film taken by local Pittsburgh TV station WTAE-TV which showed &quot;[n]o question about it – Bradshaw&#x27;s pass struck Tatum squarely on his right shoulder.&quot; Cope stated that WTAE&#x27;s film would be next to impossible to find again because of inadequate filing procedures at the station.

In 2004, John Fetkovich, an emeritus professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University, analyzed the NFL Films clip of the play. He concluded, based on the trajectory of the bounced ball and conservation of momentum, that the ball must have bounced off Tatum, who was running upfield at the time, rather than Fuqua, who was running across and down the field. Fetkovich also performed experiments by throwing a football against a brick wall at a velocity greater than , twice the speed Fetkovich calculated that Bradshaw&#x27;s pass was traveling when it reached Tatum and Fuqua. Fetkovitch achieved a maximum rebound of when the ball hit point first and when the ball hit belly first, both less than the that the ball rebounded during the play. Timothy Gay, a physics professor and a longtime Raiders fan, cited Fetkovich&#x27;s work with approval in his book &quot;The Physics of Football&quot; and concluded that &quot;the referees made the right call in the Immaculate Reception.&quot;

Bradshaw himself had made points similar to those of Fetkovich fifteen years earlier, stating that he did not think that he had thrown the ball hard enough for it to bounce that far back off Fuqua and that since Fuqua was running across the field, the ball would have veered to the right if it had hit him. Bradshaw opined that the ball must have bounced off the upfield-moving Tatum – if that had happened then &quot;Tatum&#x27;s momentum carries the ball backward.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
The week after this playoff victory, the Steelers lost the AFC Championship Game, 21–17, to the Miami Dolphins, who went on to win Super Bowl VII in their landmark undefeated season. Had the Raiders advanced to the AFC Championship Game instead, they would have entered that contest with an all-time record (including playoffs) of 6–1–1 against the Dolphins.

Despite the loss to the Dolphins, the Steelers started to reverse four decades of futility and went on to become a dominant force in the NFL for the rest of the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls in six years with such stars as Bradshaw, Harris, John Stallworth and Lynn Swann along with the Steel Curtain defense led by Jack Ham, Jack Lambert, &quot;Mean Joe&quot; Greene, Mel Blount, and Dwight White.

The year 1972 was one year before the Steelers&#x27; fortieth year in the NFL, during which they had finished above .500 only nine times, and until then had never won a playoff game. In fact, before this game, the only playoff game the team had ever played was a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in 1947 after the two teams finished tied for the Eastern Division championship. The Immaculate Reception was actually the first touchdown the Steelers ever scored in the postseason (they were shut out against the Eagles in the 1947 playoff game). They had long been regarded as one of the league&#x27;s doormats (as the 1944 Card-Pitt merger was 0–10 and was ridiculed as the &quot;Carpitts,&quot; a play on the word &quot;carpet&quot;). Between 1950 and 1970, the Steelers finished as high as second place once, doing so in 1962, which garnered them an exhibition game called the &quot;Playoff Bowl&quot;. As recently as 1969, the team had posted a 1–13 record, thus securing the first draft choice in the subsequent NFL draft, in which the Steelers chose Bradshaw that seeded their remarkable turnaround. Since the AFL–NFL merger, the Steelers have the league&#x27;s best record (surpassing Miami in 2007 because of the Dolphins&#x27; recent struggles), have had a league-low three head coaches, and have had only nine losing seasons, none worse than 5–11. Only twice since the Immaculate Reception has the team had losing seasons two years in a row and none three years in a row.

The Immaculate Reception spawned a heated rivalry between the Steelers and the Raiders, a rivalry that was at its peak during the 1970s, when both teams were among the best in the league and both were known for their hard-hitting, physical play. The teams met in the playoffs in each of the next four seasons, starting with the Raiders&#x27; 33–14 victory in the 1973 divisional playoffs. Pittsburgh used the AFC Championship Game victories over Oakland (24–13 at Oakland in 1974 and 16–10 at Pittsburgh in 1975) as a springboard to victories in Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl X, before the Raiders notched a 24–7 victory at home in 1976 on their way to winning Super Bowl XI. To date, the two last met in the playoffs in 1983 when the eventual Super Bowl champion Raiders, playing in Los Angeles at the time, crushed the Steelers, 38–10. The rivalry has somewhat died off in the years since, mainly due to the Raiders&#x27; on-field struggles since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII.

The play itself started another rivalry between the Raiders and the rest of the league, as Raider fans have long thought that the league has wanted to shortchange the team and specifically owner Al Davis. In 2007, NFL Network ranked the &quot;Raiders versus the World&quot; as the biggest feud in NFL history.

More positively, the play ironically led to the lifelong friendship between Harris and Villapiano due to their shared Italian American heritage, despite their difference of opinions on the events of the play. A year after the play, Harris had discovered that both his mother and Villapiano&#x27;s father, both Italian immigrants, hailed from the same area of the Italian Peninsula after Villapiano&#x27;s father helped Harris&#x27; mother (who still wasn&#x27;t fluent in English at the time) speak for her son at a banquet in their native New Jersey. This led to the two becoming friendlier away from the football field with Harris becoming an &quot;honorary Raider&quot; while Villapiano has accepted the events of the play over time.

For the 1978 NFL season, the NFL passed two rule changes that would have affected the Immaculate Reception had it happened today. The first one, regarding the forward pass touching an offensive player but being caught by another without touching a defender, was repealed. There are no longer any restrictions on any deflections of passes, and a future play that mirrored the Immaculate Reception would simply be an extraordinary but legal reception. Second, the NFL also passed tougher pass interference rules (ironically as a result of the Steelers&#x27; own Mel Blount, among others), which if in effect in 1972 would have penalized the Raiders regardless of the result of the play due to Tatum&#x27;s hit on Fuqua; as the goal post would be at the goal line until 1974 when they were moved back to the end line, such a penalty would have placed the Steelers in relatively short field goal range for Gerela to try a game-winning field goal from 42 yards out. Whether a future Franco Harris would have been ruled as catching such a deflected football before it struck the turf is a different matter, thanks to myriad cameras and use of instant replay that is part of the present-day NFL.

As 1972 was the last year that the NFL forbade any local telecasts of home games, the game itself was not shown live on Pittsburgh NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now WPXI), nor was it shown on nearby NBC affiliates WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, Ohio; WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, West Virginia; and then-NBC affiliate WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia, all of which are secondary markets to the Steelers. WICU-TV in Erie, Pennsylvania and then-NBC O&amp;O WKYC-TV in Cleveland were the closest stations to air the game (although WIIC-TV showed the game on tape delay the following day). Starting the next year, any home games that sold out 72 hours before kick-off could be televised locally. As the Steelers began their home sell-out streak in 1972, blackouts have never been needed in the Pittsburgh area.

===Game ball===
The actual ball ended up in the hands of fan Jim Baker, who attended the game with his young nephew, Bobby. Baker managed to scoop up the ball during the ensuing melee after the extra point kick, grabbed his nephew, and ran off the field. He had offered to give the ball back to the Steelers in return for lifetime season tickets but was rebuffed. He has since declined any offer to sell it, including the highest offer of $150,000 from heavy equipment provider Ray Anthony International. Baker has instead kept this coveted piece of NFL memorabilia in a guarded bank vault in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, occasionally bringing it out for public appearances involving the Steelers, including one with Franco Harris in 1997 to commemorate the play&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

===Legacy===
The Steelers organization still consider the Immaculate Reception the greatest moment in team history. The play was documented by NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;A Football Life&quot; in 2012.

On December 23, 2012, on the fortieth anniversary of the play just hours before the Steelers hosted the Cincinnati Bengals, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Harris made the reception at a parking lot just outside Heinz Field, where Three Rivers Stadium formerly stood. This is the third such monument that commemorates the play in the city (the others are located at the Pittsburgh International Airport and the Heinz History Center).

In the 2013–14 NFL playoffs, Seattle Seahawks&#x27; Richard Sherman deflected a pass by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, that was intended for Michael Crabtree, which was caught by teammate Malcolm Smith to seal the Seahawks&#x27; 23–17 victory in the NFC Championship Game. The play was later dubbed &quot;the Immaculate Deflection&quot; (as an homage to the Immaculate Reception), and would later be voted by Seahawks fans to be the most significant play in franchise history.

For Super Bowl XLIX, Wix.com ran an ad featuring retired football players using its tools to build websites for their new businesses, including Harris who creates a fictional wedding planning website called &quot;Immaculate Receptions&quot; named after the famous play.

&quot;The 100-Year Game&quot;, a short film created by the league for Super Bowl LIII, featured many current and former football stars. In it, Bradshaw is seen throwing a football across the room towards such contemporary star receivers as Larry Fitzgerald and Odell Beckham Jr. — only to see the ball tipped, and snatched by Harris just before it hits the floor.

A 2019 poll of media members by the NFL named the Immaculate Reception as the greatest NFL play in its history.

On December 24, 2022, while hosting the present-day Las Vegas Raiders to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, Harris became only the third player in Steelers history to have his jersey retired. Harris had died four days earlier on December 20, and was originally scheduled to appear during the ceremony.

<doc id="430987" wikidata="Q36962" url="?curid=430987" title="Xavante language">
<text>The Xavante language is an Akuwẽ (Central Jê) language (Jê, Macro-Jê) spoken by the Xavante people in the area surrounding Eastern Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Xavante language is unusual in its phonology, its ergative object–agent–verb word order, and its use of honorary and endearment terms in its morphology.

The Xavante people are approximately 18,380 individuals in 170 villages as of 2014, but the language is spoken by 9,600 people, of whom about 7,000 are monolingual. The current speakers, made up of all ages, use the language vigorously and hold positive attitudes towards Xavante. It has been orthographically rendered as Chavante and Shavante, and is also called Akuen, Akwen, A’uwe Uptabi, A’we, Crisca, Pusciti, and Tapuac.

== Classification ==
Xavante is a member of the Jê language family, itself a member of the Macro-Gê stock. This stock is spoken in a wide distribution of non-central Brazil; Macro-Gê is also popular in the eastern, northern, and central, and southwestern parts of the country, as well as being distributed in nearby Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, but the Jê family is its only remaining large subgroup, with other languages remaining in isolates due to extinction. Within Jê, its 16 languages are distributed in four divisions; northern, north-eastern, central, and southern, and are better preserved than other languages in the stock due to its inland-inhabiting speakers. Xavante is classified in the central, alongside Xerente, Xakriaba, and Akroa. The stock is marked by a large presence of nasal vowels, this also being marked in the proto- Jê reconstructed language. Consonant inventories of the Macro-Ge stock are of medium size, with Xavante historically undergoing a phonological change from velar consonants to glottal stops. All are mildly synthetic, without complex morphology, and have SV constituent orders.

== History ==
The Xavante people originate from the east of the Araguaia River, in what was then called the province of Goias. In the early 18th century, this area was heavily invaded by colonizers searching for gold, leading to the indigenous population in the area to suffer from epidemics and live in the residential settlements created by the government. Following this, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, groups of indigenous people, now distinctly self-identifying as Xavante, settled in Mato Grosso; this area was relatively undisturbed until the 1930s.

At this point, the government under Getúlio Vargas initiated the ‘March to the West’ campaign within the National Integration Program, in which expansion to the interior of Brazil and ‘domestication of the Savage’ were heavily promoted. The Xavante people were used in print media as illustrations of newly ‘pacified’ people who had decided to ‘join Brazilian society’. In the meantime, groups including missionaries had invaded the Mato Grosso to try to convert the Xavanate into Catholicism; the indigenous people, angry at the unsolicited invasion, attacked the group in return. However, following this period until the 1960s peaceful contacts, in which goods were exchanged, were established.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Xavante land was coveted for farming and agriculture purposes; deals to arrange transfers to white settlers were often fraudulent, and land used for monocultures, such as entire fields of rice, or grazing. The people were transferred from Mato Grosso to southern Brazil, a less fertile region; however, the Xavante people then began the attempt to recover the land they had lived on prior to contact with settlers in the 1970s, with demands for territory being met with violence by large capitalist companies that now had hold of the areas. In 1981, six areas were demarcated to the Xavante, and in 1991, the rights to extensions of some areas were won. However, conflicts regarding the territories between the Xavante and Brazilian government continue today. Currently, there has been a Program of Documentation of Indigenous Cultures (PRODOCULT) devoted to Xavante, run by J.R. Welch and R. Costa; the permanent collection, containing images, text, cartography and more information on the Xavante people and language, is housed in the Museum of the Indian.

== Documentation ==

=== Ethnography ===
The Xavante people have been studied in ethnographies; in 2010 and 2011, demographic information and ethnographic details were researched for the context of health among the Xavante by Basta, and tuberculosis specifically being examined alongside ethnographic information by DeSouza. Contemporary Xavante research by Lecena and colleagues in 2016 and Da Silva in 1999 has also investigated inactivity and socioeconomic status in the region and general information regarding the ways that Xavante people were living in the late 20th and early 21st century.

===Xavante in linguistics===
The Xavante language was first referenced in the 19th century, in works of comparative philology which used word lists from the language and overviews of its structure. In the 20th century, Xavante has been studied academically since the 1960s by both Brazilian and foreign linguists, starting with a grammar; papers from this period examined the language’s phonemes, syllable structure, as well as aspect and acquisition. By the 1980s, works on the syntax and semantics of Xavante were published, focusing on sentence initial devices and focus; the first Xavante-Portuguese dictionary was also produced by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, all of whom had researched extensively in Xavante (1987). Since the 1990s, more specific properties of the language have been researched academically, namely with respect to acquisition, name agreement, assimilation, morphology, and respect/intimacy relationships. A revised Xavante-Portuguese dictionary, again compiled by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, was released in 2004.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Xavante is described by McLeod (1974).

===Vowels===
Xavante has nine vowel qualities, long and short. Four occur nasalized, long and short. 
 is when long and when short. is raised after in a non-initial syllable. is a central vowel. It is a rounded in certain stylistic conventions. is a mid vowel when long, and a more open when short. is when long and or when short. and do not vary much. is written in the orthography.

===Consonants===
Xavante has ten consonants, illustrated in the chart below.

The phonetic realizations of these phonemes include those shown in the following chart:

( varies between obstruent and sonorant, alveolar and palatal.)

Xavante is highly unusual in lacking velar consonants, except for the labio-velar approximant . At a phonemic level, it arguably also lacks nasal consonants, which is less unusual in the Amazon. The language however has a high degree of allophony, and nasal stops appear before nasal vowels.

====Allophony====
With so few phonemic contrasts, Xavante allows wide latitude in allophones of its consonants. 
* P and T: are aspirated as syllable onsets (at the beginning of a word, between vowels, or before /r/), and unreleased as syllable codas (at the end of a word or before a consonant other than /r/).
* C: freely varies among as an onset, and as a coda (only preceding another , as ).
* ’: is a glottal stop .
* B: In a C or CC syllable onset before an oral vowel, is pronounced as a plain voiced stop at the beginning of a phonological word, and as either or as a prenasalized voiced stop in the middle of a word. Before nasal vowels, as C or CC, it is pronounced .

:As a syllable coda, is pronounced before regardless of the following vowel&#x27;s nasality, and optionally also as before the oral allophones of the other voiced obstruents, and : or . It is before .
* D: In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, is pronounced either as a plain voiced stop or as prenasalized voiced stop . Unlike , it may be prenasalized at the beginning of a phonological word, not just as a syllable onset. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced .

:As a syllable coda, is pronounced before the oral allophone of a consonant, and as before a nasal consonant.
* J: In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, is pronounced , in free variation. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced .

:As a syllable coda, is generally pronounced , and is nasalized to or &quot;after&quot; a nasal vowel. It is also nasalized to before a prenasalized stop allophone. Between oral vowels, the sequence optionally takes an epenthetic : or . When is followed by an , a nasalized epenthetic schwa separates them.
* R: is an alveolar flap, , which is nasalized between nasal vowels.
* W: is similar to English &quot;w,&quot; but not rounded before the vowel .

* H: has no place of articulation, but is a voiceless transition between vowels.

Vowels do not become nasalized because of nasalized consonants, so the only consonants that become nasal are those in a cluster preceding a nasal vowel (and coda after a nasal vowel); a preceding oral vowel blocks the nasality from spreading to preceding syllables.

===Phonotactics===
Xavante syllables are of the forms CV, CCV, CVC, CCVC, CV:, and CCV:; that is, all syllables begin with a consonant, sometimes two; they may optionally either end with a consonant or have a long vowel. Although a &quot;syllable&quot; may end in a consonant, a phonological &quot;word&quot; may not, apart from a few cases of word-final .

The attested initial CC consonant clusters are: 
All seven obstruents occur in final position, but in a maximal CCVC syllable only are attested. Across two syllables, the following CC sequences are attested: 
:
:
:
There are also CCC sequences such as (coda followed by onset ).

The vowels and are rare, and not attested in maximal CCVC syllables.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
In Xavante, morphological variations of words are a significant aspect of generating new constructions within the language. For example, morphology reflects honorific status, in that morphemes are used to denote relationships of intimacy and kinship. Similarly, social positions and situations of individuals are marked using morphological constructions; for instance, &quot;a’ama&quot;, a group of Xavante men trained in new forms of pre-existing words, are referred to by other members of the clan using a specific set of morphological forms. Xavante also uses a reflexive prefix, &quot;tsi-&quot;, in situations requiring this grammatical construction to be denoted; for instance, &quot;ʔmadə&quot; (to look at) becomes &quot;tsi-ʔmadə&quot; (to look at oneself). Finally, the postverbal morpheme &quot;ni&quot; appears when referring to a generic or unknown subject, as in &quot;ma ø-wæræ ni&quot; (&quot;someone (unknown) killed him&quot;). Morphological changes are important in generating meaning in Xavante, and reflect the possibilities of showing meaning using set morphemes.

As previously discussed, Xavante expresses relationships between people in its morphology. This is particularly reflected in familial connections; a child must use the respectful grammatical forms when growing older in reference to their parents and grandparents, and are scolded if they do not do so . For example, the morpheme &quot;a&quot; is added to refer to a second person singular; a boy asking his grandfather to give a favor to his grandmother is generated thus:

Conversation between men and their fathers-in-law is also marked by use of honorific grammatical variants, used by both parties. Finally, a couple that has been arranged to be married also enter a specific relationship, known as &quot;dasiwasini&quot;, and must use grammatical forms denoting respect. In all, morphological variation in Xavante is critical to displaying intimacy and closeness between people, and in marking where such a relationship exists through the way they refer to one another, with more personal relationships being denoted by special grammatical forms. Also previously discussed was the use of the post-verbal morpheme &quot;ni&quot; when referring to unknown subjects. This is formally known as a &quot;non-referential subject&quot;, in that the subject does not refer to immediate entity in the world; for instance in saying ‘people’ as a collective instead of &quot;my uncle&quot;. This morpheme is added in both transitive and intransitive clauses, for instance when saying both &quot;people love me&quot; and &quot;people run&quot;. &quot;Ni&quot; is also commonly used with another morpheme, &quot;da&quot;, as a person prefix referring to a generic entity; for example, to use both transitive and intransitive sentences as examples:

In these ways, Xavante uses morphological variation to express concepts relating to abstract individuals that exist in a different way than concrete, specific people. By extension, the language uses morphology in general to conceptualize a variety of concepts, including closeness in relationships as well as personal prefixes.

===Pronouns===
===Case===
The syntax of Xavante utilizes several types of case markings in its structures, marking the intransitive subject (S), transitive subject or agent (A), and transitive object or patient (O) in different ways. First, it distinguishes between a number marking system and a person marking system, with both containing several subsystems. The former uses a neutral subsystem when arguments fulfill certain criteria. It also includes a Nominative-Accusative subsystem when the (O) of a transitive argument falls under a specified category. Finally, the person marking system of Xavante is notable for having multiple subsystems. As a consequence, examining these case systems is vital to understanding the syntax of Xavante.

Xavante’s case systems emphasise the lexicalization of number systems. Particles in the language depend on whether it is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person; whether the referent is in the subject, object, possessor, or complement position; and if the predicate is a noun (nominal) or a verb (verbal). Xavante also uses a singular, dual, and plural, and the number of the referent also dictate which number particle will be used. Within this number marking system, verbal clauses use a neutral marking subsystem, in which the marking of (A), (S), and (O) is identical whenever these arguments are singular or when (O) is definite and all three arguments are non-singular. A neutral system is marked for having the three arguments marked identically, and is common across languages. In Xavante, this situation is referred to as neutral because, in the first case, none of the three core arguments get marked, and in the second all get the same marking. An example is seen here:

The number system in Xavante also contains a nominative-accusative subsystem, found when (O) is non-singular and indefinite, when (O) is 1st person dual, or (O) is 2nd person dual and (A) 1st person plural simultaneously. A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two are unmarked, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:

Xavante also uses a person-marking system, in which subjects and objects are marked differently depending on a number of criteria. The absolutive series marks both intransitive subjects and transitive objects; the accusative series marks 1st person dual, plural object, 3rd person singular, or dual or plural object when the subject is 2nd person singular, dual, or plural; the nominative series marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive clauses; and an emphatic series that marks pronouns to form emphatic pronominal expressions with both transitive and intransitive clauses. The person-marking system has more subsystems that the number one, with three variations of ergative-absolutive case markings. Ergative-Absolutive is marked as (S) and (O) being equal, with (A) being different, and the first two being assigned as ergative and the third assigned as absolutive. In Xavante, Ergative-Absolutive I uses cross-referencing on (S) and (O) only, with (A) receiving no marking. Ergative-Absolutive II is marked when (O) is in 3rd person indefinite and (A) is 2nd person plural. Ergative-Absolutive III is marked with the use of a particle or adposition after the noun, with (A) receiving a mark and (S) and (O) not receiving one, and is only used in relative and subordinate transitive clauses or negated independent transitive clauses:

Xavante’s person marking system also contains a tripartite subsystem, in which (A), (S), and (O) are all treated differently. In Xavante, this specifically occurs as all arguments receiving different arguments from the different series previously discussed. This is seen here:

Xavante’s person-marking system also has a variation of a Nominative-Accusative system, in which (S) and (A) are marked differently from (O), as shown in both example sentences above.

Finally, Xavante has two Split subsystems; the first, Split-S, is found in the subjects of nominal predicates. The second, Split-O, occurs in relative clauses. Overall, the person marking system in Xavante contains multiple subsystems depending on the situations in which they appear.

In all, Xavante uses a number of case-marking systems in its clauses that varies depending on number and person markings. It provides examples of a neutral system, Nominative-Accusative subsystems, Ergative-Absolutive subsystems, and split subsystems, varying based on different triggers.

===Plurals===

In the Xavante language, plurals as well as duals are used to mark arguments in a clause. The language differentiates between singular nouns and dual, of which there is a quantity of two, and plural, in which the argument contains more than two items. These are expressed using morphological methods, including units that are used in a variety of contexts, including in different combinations. These markings appear to be used particularly for human subjects, and overall are vital to the structure of a clause in Xavante.

Dual arguments in Xavante, particularly those referring to people, use one of several possible morphological units. In order to describe a pair of human arguments, it is first important to distinguish between the first, second, and third person. For using the dual first person as a subject (&quot;We both&quot;), the morpheme &quot;ʔwa&quot; is used at the beginning of the clause, with &quot;dĩ&quot; at the end of the clause; in combination they produce the first person dual. This is seen here:

When using the dual first person as an object, however, a different morpheme, &quot;ʔĩwa&quot;, is attached to the main verb:

When using the second person dual (&quot;Ye both&quot;), reduplication is used to denote optionality in the clause. In the first case, when &quot;both&quot; is implied, &quot;ʔwa&quot; alone is used at the end of the clause, with the reduplicated &quot;ʔwaʔwa&quot; occurring earlier as follows:

However, when the dual is not optional in the clause, only the reduplicated &quot;ʔwaʔwa&quot; occurs, at the end of the clause, as here:

Finally, third person dual is also denoted similarly depending on whether the argument is in the subject or object position. For the former, the morpheme &quot;dzahurɛ&quot; is placed clause-finally, and denotes &quot;They both&quot;, as seen here:

However, when the third person dual is in the object position, the same morpheme, &quot;dzahurɛ&quot;, is also used, as in the following example:

In all, the dual marks all arguments in Xavante, and differentiates between first, second, and third person in subject and object positions.

Plurals in Xavante, in which more than two arguments are described, is expressed using its own variations of morphemes. In the first person and third person, &quot;dzaʔra&quot; is used clause-finally, as here:

However, the second person plural is expressed differently, with the previous morpheme, &quot;dzaʔra&quot;, being combined with &quot;ʔwaʔwa&quot; in two positions, clause-medially after the initial person marker and clause-finally, as here:

In all, the plural in Xavante is expressed with less variation than in the dual, but nonetheless is always important to marking quantity of human subjects in the first, second, and third person.

<text>Mean time to recovery (MTTR) is the average time that a device will take to recover from any failure. Examples of such devices range from self-resetting fuses (where the MTTR would be very short, probably seconds), to whole systems which have to be repaired or replaced.

The MTTR would usually be part of a maintenance contract, where the user would pay more for a system MTTR of which was 24 hours, than for one of, say, 7 days. This does not mean the supplier is guaranteeing to have the system up and running again within 24 hours (or 7 days) of being notified of the failure. It does mean the average repair time will tend towards 24 hours (or 7 days). A more useful maintenance contract measure is the maximum time to recovery which can be easily measured and the supplier held accountably.

Note that some suppliers will interpret MTTR to mean &#x27;mean time to respond&#x27; and others will take it to mean &#x27;mean time to replace/repair/recover/resolve&#x27;. The former indicates that the supplier will acknowledge a problem and initiate mitigation within a certain timeframe. Some systems may have an MTTR of zero, which means that they have redundant components which can take over the instant the primary one fails, see RAID for example. However, the failed device involved in this redundant configuration still needs to be returned to service and hence the device itself has a non-zero MTTR even if the system as a whole (through redundancy) has an MTTR of zero. But, as long as service is maintained, this is a minor issue.

<doc id="430991" wikidata="Q772473" url="?curid=430991" title="The Cremaster Cycle">
<text>The Cremaster Cycle is a series of five feature-length films, together with related sculptures, photographs, drawings, and artist&#x27;s books, created by American visual artist and film-maker Matthew Barney.

&quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot; was made over a period of eight years (1994–2002) and culminated in a major museum exhibition organized by Nancy Spector of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which traveled to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne and the Musée d&#x27;art Moderne in Paris from 2002-03. Barney&#x27;s long-time collaborator Jonathan Bepler composed and arranged the soundtracks for the films. The series incorporates a multidisciplinary narrative that heavily references connections between real people, real places and real things personal to Barney himself, but are all fictionalized to some extent.

==Overview==

Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector has described the &quot;Cremaster Cycle&quot; (1994–2002) as &quot;a self-enclosed aesthetic system.&quot; The cycle includes the films as well as photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produced in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, the primary function of which is to raise and lower the testicles in response to temperature. The project is filled with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: &quot;Cremaster 1&quot; represents the most &quot;ascended&quot; or undifferentiated state, &quot;Cremaster 5&quot; the most &quot;descended&quot; or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknown — in Barney&#x27;s metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond biology as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology. Barney portrays, at various points, a satyr and Gary Gilmore. Ursula Andress portrays the Queen of Chain in &quot;Cremaster 5&quot;. Norman Mailer, Patty Griffin, and Dave Lombardo portray Harry Houdini, Nicole Baker, and Johnny Cash respectively in &quot;Cremaster 2&quot;. Richard Serra, Aimee Mullins, and Mike Bocchetti portray Hiram Abiff, Sadhbh, and the Grandmaster respectively, in &quot;Cremaster 3&quot;.

== Numerical and thematic chronology ==

While thematically the &quot;Cremaster&quot; films are chronological in the numbered order, they were not made or released in the same manner. The order in which they were made is as follows:

The numerical order is the thematic order, while in order of production the films increased in production quality, ambition and scope, and they can alternatively be viewed in any order, as different views of a set of themes and preoccupations.

The films are significantly different in length; the longest (and last-made) is &quot;Cremaster 3&quot;, at over three hours, while the remaining four are approximately an hour each, for a total of approximately seven hours – #3 alone makes up almost half the total length of the cycle. Like Barney&#x27;s other works, most of the films lack any particular dialogue with the exceptions being &quot;Cremaster 2&quot; and &quot;5,&quot; the latter of which is an opera sung in Hungarian.

An important precursor of &quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot; is &quot;Drawing Restraint,&quot; which is also a biologically inspired multi-episode work in multiple media, also featuring the field emblem.

== Availability ==
The full series was released in a limited series of 20 sets of DVDs, sold for at least $100,000 each, in custom packaging and as fine art, rather than mass-market movies. In 2007 one disc (&quot;Cremaster 2&quot;) sold for $571,000.

The films are not available on mass-market DVDs, and according to the press release for the 2010 US tour, the cycle &quot;is Not Now Nor Will it Ever be Available on DVD&quot;. The films are primarily available via periodic screenings. Palm Pictures, the distributor, has continued to comply with Barney&#x27;s request, and has not made the series available on DVD, though there were some rumors and announcements to this effect in 2003. Only a 31-minute excerpt, the Guggenheim scene from &quot;Cremaster 3&quot; titled “The Order,” was released on mass-market DVD in 2003.

==Reception==
Reaction to the cycle is sharply divided – some consider it a major work of art, on a par with &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; and &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; while others dismiss it as vapid, self-indulgent tedium. This is summarized by one critic as &quot;Barney&#x27;s cinematic art inspires both awe and revulsion, often simultaneously.&quot; Indeed, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; featured two reviews, with Jerry Saltz praising the cycle, and J. Hoberman panning it.

Lavish praise includes: &quot;&quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot; by Matthew Barney is the first truly great piece of cinema to be made in a fine art context since Dali and Bunuel filmed &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; in 1929. It is one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema.&quot; In 1999, when three of its entries (the fourth, first, and fifth) had been made, Michael Kimmelman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed Barney as &quot;the most important American artist of his generation.&quot; It has also, on the other hand, received scathing criticism as &quot;a mostly tedious succession of striking but vacant imagery whose effect diminishes the longer you look at it,&quot; from which &quot;any sense of mystery or wonder is drained.&quot;

The images are roundly praised however, and some (Hoberman) feel that the movies work well as parts of installations, due to visual elements, though not as movies, due to poor editing and pacing.

==Further reading==
The large volume by then Guggenheim curator Nancy Spector, &quot;Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle&quot; (New York: Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2002), is the standard work on the &quot;Cycle&quot; and contains reproductions of production stills, concept drawings and an exegetical essay by Spector, &quot;Only The Perverse Fantasy Can Still Save Us&quot;. Neville Wakefield has produced &quot;The Cremaster Glossary&quot;, which is also included in the book.

<doc id="430994" wikidata="Q73557" url="?curid=430994" title="2nd Canadian Division during World War II">
<text>The 2nd Canadian Division, an infantry division of the Canadian Army, was mobilized for war service on 1September 1939 at the outset of World War II. Adopting the designation of the 2nd Canadian Division, it was initially composed of volunteers within brigades established along regional lines, though a halt in recruitment in the early months of the war caused a delay in the formation of brigade and divisional headquarters. With questions concerning overseas deployment resolved, the division&#x27;s respective commands were formed in May and June 1940, and at British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s request, the division was deployed to the United Kingdom between 1August and 25December 1940, forming part of the Canadian Corps.

Having performed well in training exercises during 1941 and early 1942, elements of the 2nd Division were selected as the main force for Operation Jubilee, a large-scale amphibious raid on the port of Dieppe in German-occupied France. On 19August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division&#x27;s 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades assaulted Dieppe&#x27;s beaches. The Germans were well prepared and, despite being reinforced, the Canadians sustained heavy losses and had to be evacuated, with fewer than half their number returning to the United Kingdom.

Following a period of reconstruction and retraining from 1942 to 1944, the division joined II Canadian Corps as part of the British Second Army for the Allied invasion of Normandy. The division was redesignated as 2nd Canadian Infantry Division in January 1943. The 2nd Division saw significant action from 20July to 21August in the battles for Caen and Falaise. Joining the newly activated headquarters of the First Canadian Army in the assault on northwestern Europe, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division played a significant role in the retaking of the Channel Ports, the Battle of the Scheldt, and the liberation of the Netherlands. The division was deactivated shortly after the end of the war.

==Formation, garrison duties and organization (1939–1940)==
At the start of the Second World War, the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) was initially composed of two divisions; the 1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Divisions, both raised on 1September 1939. The fighting power of this force lay in its constituent infantry brigades, of which each division had three. These were in turn composed of three rifle and one machine gun battalion, with additional divisional artillery and engineer units in support.

Formed under the command of Major-General Victor Odlum, a highly distinguished veteran of the First World War, with an authorized strength of between 13,000 and 17,000 personnel, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, like its sister formation, was originally organized along regional lines. Its 4th Brigade was composed of regiments from Ontario, the 5th Brigade of regiments from Quebec, and 6th Brigade of regiments from Western Canada. These were the same infantry brigades—although their constituent battalions were different—that had formed part of the 2nd Canadian Division during its service on the Western Front as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.

It was over a year before the 2nd Division came together as a cohesive unit and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made. The first brigade concentrations took place in May and June 1940, until which time all units had trained in their own garrisons. The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.

The 2nd Division&#x27;s structure was altered in early 1940, reducing its number of machine-gun battalions from three to one. The Camerons and the Chaudières (now a rifle battalion) were reassigned to the newly mobilized 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, and the Winnipeg Grenadiers were sent to Jamaica for garrison duty, after which they returned to Canada then redeployed to Hong Kong, where they were captured when it fell to the Japanese on 25December 1941.

In May 1940, The Black Watch were moved from Valcartier to Newfoundland, and in June, the 2nd Division was earmarked for garrison duty by the forces of the British Commonwealth, with the Royal Regiment of Canada and &quot;Les Fusiliers Mont Royal&quot; arriving in Iceland later that month. However, at the request of Winston Churchill, the British prime minister, these deployments were cut short, as the division was badly needed in England to supplement the British Army—then facing the imminent possibility of German invasion.

As a result, most of the 2nd Division&#x27;s units were sent to the United Kingdom in August 1940, although the Iceland garrison remained in place until 31October. The absence of the &quot;Mont Royal&quot;s allowed Odlum to reassign the Calgary Highlanders to the 5th Brigade in September, in an attempt to ethnically mix the brigades of the division. By late December 1940, the 2nd Canadian Division was joined with the 1st to form the Canadian Corps (later renamed to I Canadian Corps).

==Training in the United Kingdom (1941)==

In 1941, the Toronto Scottish Regiment was transferred from the 1st Division to become the machine-gun battalion of the 2nd Division. Around the same time, the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars) was raised from 2nd Division personnel supplemented by reinforcements from Canada. Due to equipment shortages, it was often difficult to adequately supply newly arrived divisions in England. Artillery units had to make use of outmoded 75 mm guns with steel tires, and a lack of anti-aircraft guns—diverted to civil defence during the height of the Battle of Britain—left Canadian units to fend for themselves with small arms. However, by February 1941, enough Bren guns had been issued to the infantry units and, by September, the artillery had been equipped with 25-pounder () howitzers, although signals equipment and transport were still lacking and anti-tank guns were dangerously scarce.

When the division was not engaged in coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training took the form of increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14 to 16June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.

On 23December 1941, Major-General Harry Crerar was appointed as divisional commander, replacing Odlum who had ceased command in November, temporarily handing over to Major-General John Roberts. However, Crerar was appointed temporary corps commander the same day and as a result never actually fulfilled the role of divisional commander, with Roberts eventually being confirmed in the role in April 1942. Meanwhile, on 30December 1941, the Calgary Highlanders introduced &quot;battle drill&quot; to the division. This new type of training emphasized small unit tactics as well as &quot;hardening&quot; training through use of live ammunition, slaughterhouse visits, and obstacle courses, and was adopted throughout Commonwealth forces stationed in Britain.

==Operation Jubilee (1942)==

In early 1942, under Roberts, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division participated in several additional full-scale combat exercises, again gauging the ability of Commonwealth divisions to repel a possible German invasion. As April and May progressed, the exercises intensified, becoming significantly more demanding on the participants. As a result, the 2nd Division was judged to be one of the four best divisions in the United Kingdom, and was selected as the primary force for the upcoming Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe—codenamed Operation Jubilee. Mounted as a test of whether or not such a landing was feasible, the Dieppe raid was to be undertaken by the 4th and 6th Brigades, with additional naval, air, and infantry support. Significant elements of the 5th Brigade were also involved.

On 19August 1942, while British commando units attacked bunker positions on the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division landed on four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was at the foot of a sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the Black Watch, was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders. Only six percent of the men that landed on Blue Beach returned to Britain.

The main beaches, codenamed White and Red, lay in front of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the majority of the 4th and 6th Brigades became pinned down on the beach, and despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the Calgary Tank Regiment, casualties were heavy. Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than half were killed, wounded or captured.

At Green Beach to the west, part of the South Saskatchewan Regiment was landed on the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was captured but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.

==Rebuilding (1942–1944)==
Throughout 1943, the 2nd Division focused on rebuilding its ranks, having lost close to half its strength at Dieppe. In April 1943, Major-General Guy Simonds—the first officer to command the division who had not served in the Great War—assumed command of the division, taking over from Roberts, before handing over the following month to Major-General E. L. M. Burns. In January 1944, Major-General Charles Foulkes—another officer who, like Simonds, had been too young to serve in the Great War—replaced Burns, who went to Italy to command I Canadian Corps, where it had been deployed towards the end of 1943. The following month, all three brigade commanders were replaced as part of a general move to modernize the Canadian forces&#x27; higher echelons; further sweeping changes throughout all levels of command, coupled with the lingering effects of the large influx of new personnel during 1943, lowered morale in the division. However, in March 1944, training again intensified, heralding the coming invasion of Europe. On 9March, the 2nd Division was inspected by King George VI, and by May the division numbered close to 18,000 fully equipped and trained soldiers. When D-Day arrived on 6June 1944, the main Canadian assault was led by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, while the 2nd Division was held in reserve. At this time, the division consisted of three brigades—4th, 5th and 6th—each of three infantry battalions, and a brigade ground defence platoon provided by Lorne Scots. In addition, at divisional level there was a machine gun battalion and a reconnaissance regiment provided by the Toronto Scottish Regiment (machine gun) and 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars), as well as various combat support and service support elements including field, anti-tank and anti-aircraft artillery, field engineers, electrical and mechanical engineers, and signals, medical, ordnance, service corps troops and provosts.

==Battle of Normandy==

The attack on Juno Beach by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was the most successful of the five beaches attacked on D-Day, 6June 1944. Having successfully landed in Normandy, Allied forces soon became embroiled in battles against German armour and were unable to significantly expand their beachhead; by the time the 2nd Division came ashore at the end of the first week of July, the entire front had congealed. Assigned to the II Canadian Corps, and subordinated to the British Second Army, the division assembled its brigades for combat while British and Canadian forces launched Operation Charnwood. It was a tactical success, but could not clear all Caen of its German defenders. Although originally a D-Day objective, Caen proved a difficult prize, holding out until 19July when it finally fell to British troops during Operation Goodwood. In the aftermath, General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, ordered elements of II Canadian Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, to push forward towards Verrières Ridge, the dominant geographical feature between Caen and Falaise. By keeping up the pressure, Montgomery hoped to divert German attention away from the American sector to the west.

===Operation Atlantic===
Operation Atlantic, launched on 18July alongside Goodwood, had the objectives of securing the western bank of the Orne River and Verrières Ridge. The 2nd Division&#x27;s 5th and 6th Brigades were selected as the assaulting forces, with the 5th Brigade focusing on the Orne and the 6th on Verrières. The 4th Brigade were tasked with securing the flank of the operation, and the Royal Regiment of Canada attacked Louvigny on 18July. Early on 19July, the Calgary Highlanders seized Point 67, directly north of Verrières Ridge, and the following morning the Royal Highland Regiment of Canada crossed the Orne River and secured the flanks of the advance. In the afternoon, the 6th Brigade&#x27;s South Saskatchewan Regiment attacked the well-entrenched German positions on the ridge, with support from Typhoon fighter-bombers and tanks. However, the attack ran into torrential rain, and the Germans counterattacked in force. This and further German attacks inflicted heavy casualties on the South Saskatchewan Regiment and its supporting battalions, the Essex Scottish Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. On 21July, the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade reinforced Canadian positions on Point 67. In two days of fighting, the division suffered 1,349 casualties.

===Operation Spring===

On 22July 1944, Montgomery elected to use the Anglo-Canadian forces south of Caen in an all-out offensive aimed at breaking the German defensive cordon keeping his forces bottled up in Normandy. To meet Montgomery&#x27;s objectives, General Simonds was ordered to design a large breakout assault, codenamed Operation Spring. The attack was planned in three tightly timed phases of advance, pitting two Canadian and two British divisions against three German SS-Panzer divisions, which would be launched in conjunction with an American offensive, Operation Cobra, scheduled to take place on 25July 1944.

The 4th Brigade attacked in the east with some success, taking Verrières village itself, but were repulsed at Tilly-la-Campagne by German counterattacks. The 5th Brigade, in the centre, made a bid for Fontenay-le-Marmion; of the 325 members of the Black Watch who left the start-lines, only 15 answered evening roll-call. German counterattacks on 26 and 27July pushed Canadian forces back to Point 67. However, the situation eventually eased for the 2nd Canadian Division when US forces went on the offensive. Throughout the first week of August, significant German resources were transferred from the Anglo-Canadian front to that of the U.S. Third Army, under Lieutenant-General George Patton, while reinforcements moved from Pas de Calais to the Falaise–Calvados area. By 7August 1944, only one major formation—the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend—faced Canadian forces on Verrières Ridge.

===Operation Totalize===
By 1August 1944, the British had made significant gains on the Vire and Orne Rivers during Operation Bluecoat, while the Americans had achieved a complete breakthrough in the west. On 4August, Simonds and General Harry Crerar—newly appointed commander of the First Canadian Army—were given the order to prepare an advance on Falaise. Three days later, with heavy bomber support, Operation Totalize began, marking the first use of Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers. While the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked east of the Caen–Falaise Road, 2nd Division attacked to the west. By noon Verrières Ridge had finally fallen, and Canadian and Polish armour was preparing to exploit south towards Falaise. However, strong resistance by the 12th SS Panzer Division and the 272nd &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; Division halted the advance. Although 12 km (7.5 mi) of ground had been gained, Canadian forces had failed to reach Falaise itself.

Simultaneously, the Germans had launched Operation Luttich, a desperate and ill-prepared armoured thrust towards Mortain, beginning on 6August 1944. This was halted within a day and, despite the increasingly dangerous threat presented by the Anglo–Canadian advance on Falaise, the German commander Field Marshal Günther von Kluge was prohibited by Hitler from redeploying his forces. Thus, as American armoured formations advanced towards Argentan from the south, the Allies were presented with an opportunity to encircle large sections of the German Seventh Army. The First Canadian Army was ordered south, while the Americans prepared to move on Chambois on 14August. Simonds and Crerar quickly planned a further offensive that would push through to Falaise, trapping the German Seventh Army in Normandy.

===Operation Tractable===
On 14August, the First Canadian Army launched Operation Tractable with the aim of capturing Falaise and achieving a linkup with American forces in Chambois. A daylight attack was executed after artillery provided smoke-screen cover and medium bombers softened up the German defences. The offensive was largely successful and, although the 2nd Division was not an active participant, divisional troops entered Falaise on 16August as the remainder of First Canadian Army moved south-east towards Trun and Chambois. By 21August the remnants of the battered German Seventh Army had surrendered in the Falaise Pocket, bringing the Battle of Normandy to a close. The German forces committed to Normandy since D-Day had been virtually annihilated—by the end of Operation Tractable, the 12th SS Panzer Division, the main adversary of the Canadians, had lost 80% of its tanks, 70% of its personnel carriers, and 60% of its artillery.

Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Division moved to Foret de la Londe, along the valley of the River Seine. From 27to 29August, the 4th and 6th Brigades were engaged in heavy fighting against the rearguard of German forces seeking to withdraw across the Seine.

==The Channel Ports and the Scheldt==

Throughout September and October 1944, the First Canadian Army moved along the coast of France with the aim of securing the Channel Ports. On 1September, while the 3rd Division made for Boulogne and Calais, the 2nd Division entered Dieppe, encountering virtually no resistance. Five days later they were tasked by Montgomery and Crerar with retaking Dunkirk. Heavy fighting around the outskirts would hold the division for several days but, by 9September, the 5th Brigade had captured the port. The Dunkirk perimeter was handed over to the British on 15September, and the 2nd Division made for Antwerp.

Although the Belgian White Brigade, the 11th Armoured Division, and elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division had entered Antwerp as early as 4September, taking the city and docks, a strategic oversight meant that the nearby bridges over the Albert Canal were not seized, leaving the Germans in control of the Scheldt estuary. The failure to make an immediate push on the estuary ensured the strategically vital port would remain useless until the Scheldt was cleared. Strong formations of the German Fifteenth Army, which had withdrawn from the Pas de Calais, were able to consolidate their positions on the islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, as well as the Albert Canal directly northwest of Antwerp, and were further reinforced by elements of General Kurt Student&#x27;s First Parachute Army.

During the initial phases of the battle, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division sought to force a crossing of the Albert Canal. On 2October, the entire First Canadian Army—under the temporary command of General Simonds—moved against the German defences. Two days later, 2nd Division had cleared the canal, and was moving northwest towards South Beveland and Walcheren Island. On Friday, 13October, later known as &quot;Black Friday&quot;, the 5th Brigade&#x27;s Black Watch attacked positions near the coast, losing all four company commanders and over 200 men. Three days later, the Calgary Highlanders conducted a more successful offensive, capturing the initial objective of Woensdrecht. Simultaneously, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division captured Bergen, cutting off South Beveland and Walcheren from reinforcement.

==Battles for the Rhine (November 1944 – March 1945)==
By November 1944, the First Canadian Army had entered the Nijmegen Salient which was being held for use in the development of future offensives. The 2nd Division came under the command of Major-General Bruce Matthews, with Foulkes being transferred to command the I Canadian Corps on the Italian Front. The First Canadian Army launched no major offensive operations from November 1944 to January 1945; the longest hiatus the Canadians had enjoyed since landing on the Normandy beaches the previous June.

Operation Veritable was designed to bring the 21st Army Group to the west bank of the Rhine River, the last natural obstacle before entering Germany. Initially scheduled for December 1944, the operation was delayed until February by the German Ardennes Offensive. Plans were developed to breach three successive defensive lines: the outpost screen; a formidable section of the Siegfried Line running through the Hochwald Forest; and finally the Hochwald Layback covering the approach to the ultimate objective of Xanten. The first phase began on 8February 1945, with the 2nd Division&#x27;s advance following up one of the largest artillery barrages seen on the Western Front. The Germans had prepared significant defences in depth, both within the outpost screen and the Siegfried Line itself, and to add to the Canadians&#x27; difficulties, constant rain and cold weather obscured the battlefield. However, by the end of the first day, the 2nd Division had captured their objectives—the fortified towns of Wyler and Den Heuvel. On 11February, the division moved southeast to assist British XXX Corps in their assault on Moyland Wood.

The operational plan&#x27;s second phase called for the 2nd and 3rd Divisions to take the Hochwald Forest. Following its capture, the 4th Canadian Armoured would sweep through the Hochwald Gap towards Wesel, followed by the 2nd Division &quot;leap-frogging&quot; towards Xanten. Operation Blockbuster was scheduled for 27February, but despite initial gains, stubborn German resistance prolonged the battle for six days. It was not until 3March that the forest was cleared—during the intense close-quarter fighting, Major Frederick Tilston of the Essex Scottish Regiment won a Victoria Cross.

Operation Blockbuster&#x27;s final phase was the attack on Xanten itself, which lasted from 8to 10March. This fell primarily to the 2nd Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, although the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division was temporarily assigned to Simonds&#x27;s II Canadian Corps for the assault. Despite an elaborate preceding artillery barrage, dogged German resistance caused the battle to degenerate into one of attrition. Because effective air-support was prevented by fog and movement was hindered by German mortar barrages, the British and Canadians suffered heavy casualties. However, by 10March, the 2nd Division&#x27;s 5th Brigade had linked up with elements of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, bringing the offensive to a close. Total Canadian casualties during Veritable and Blockbuster were 5,304 killed or wounded.

==North of the Rhine (March–May 1945)==

As Canadian forces had incurred heavy casualties in clearing a path to the Rhine, the 2nd Division was excluded from the massive crossing operation that took place on 23March 1945, instead crossing unopposed a week later after a bridgehead had been secured. After a brief detour through German territory, the First Canadian Army—now unified with the arrival of I Canadian Corps from the Italian Front—prepared to assault German positions in the Netherlands. The 2nd Division moved northwards towards Groningen. In the nine days preceding their attack, German resistance had been light and uncoordinated, but opposition stiffened as the assault progressed, leading to heavy losses among the battalions of the 5th Brigade. By 13April, the division had been shifted eastward to guard the flanks of a British assault on Bremen, and the following day ICanadian Corps liberated Arnhem. On 2May, the 2nd Division took Oldenburg, solidifying Canadian positions throughout the Netherlands. German and Canadian forces declared a ceasefire on 5May, and all fighting came to an end with the surrender of German forces in Western Europe on 7May 1945. In October 1945, after four months in the Netherlands, General Order 52/46 officially disbanded the headquarters of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. By December, the entirety of the division had been stood down and returned to Canada. The division suffered heavy casualties through 1944 and 1945; according to Bercuson it had the &quot;highest casualty ratio in the Canadian Army – from the time it returned to combat in early July 1944 until the end of the war&quot;.
