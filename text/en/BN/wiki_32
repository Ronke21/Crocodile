<text>Anseranatidae, the magpie-geese, is a biological family of waterbirds. The only living species, the magpie goose, is a resident breeder in northern Australia and in southern New Guinea.

==Systematics and evolution==
This family is placed in the order Anseriformes, having the characteristic bill structure, but is considered to be distinct from the other families in this taxon. The related and extant families, Anhimidae (screamers) and Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans), contain all the other taxa.

A cladistic study of the morphology of waterfowl found that the magpie goose was an early and distinctive offshoot, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese and swans.

This family is quite old, a living fossil, having apparently diverged before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event  – the relative &quot;Vegavis iaai&quot; lived some 68–67 million years ago. The fossil record is limited, nonetheless. The enigmatic genus &quot;Anatalavis&quot; (Hornerstown Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene of New Jersey, USA – London Clay Early Eocene of Walton-on-the-Naze, England) is sometimes considered to be the earliest known anseranatid. Another Paleogene bird genus sometimes considered an anseranatid is &quot;Anserpica&quot;, from the Late Oligocene of Billy-Créchy (France). The earliest known member of the group in Australia is &quot;Eoanseranas handae&quot;. It is represented by fossils found in the late Oligocene Carl Creek Limestone of Queensland. Additional fossils from North America and Europe suggest that the family was spread across the globe during the late Paleogene period.

<text>USS &quot;Biddle&quot;/&quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; (DD-995/DDG-5), was a Charles F. Adams-class guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy. She was the third US Naval ship named after Nicholas Biddle, one of the first five captains of the Continental Navy.

Originally to be designated as DD-955, the ship was laid down as DDG-5 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey on 18 May 1959, launched on 4 June 1960 and commissioned as USS &quot;Biddle&quot; on 5 May 1962, at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. &quot;Biddle&quot; was renamed to &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; on 28 July 1964 in honor of Admiral Claude V. Ricketts, who had died on 6 July 1964.

== Service history ==
=== As USS Biddle ===
&quot;Biddle&quot; operated in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea as part of the Second Fleet until the end of 1963. &quot;Biddle&quot; participated in naval activity near Cuba in weeks before the Cuban Missile Crisis.

A Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded for service from 19 August 1962 to 28 September 1962. &quot;Biddle&quot; made her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea at the close of 1963 returning to Norfolk in March 1964.

=== Mixed manning experiment and the decade that followed ===
From June 1964 to end of 1965 &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was part of a mixed-manning experiment for a proposed Multilateral Force (MLF). Its crew consisted of 10 officers and 164 crew from the US Navy with the remainder filled by sailors from West Germany, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Though the MLF never was created, Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze stated that the project on &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was successful. The ship&#x27;s crest includes the NATO insignia. A Navy Unit Commendation was awarded for the 18-month period.

According to Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze, Admiral Claude V. Ricketts had made great contributions to the concept of mixed manning and a Multilateral Force. Because of this, he thought it appropriate to rename USS &quot;Biddle&quot; in Ricketts&#x27; honor while the ship was conducting a mixed-manning experiment on 28 July 1964.

Her visit to Washington, D.C. in October 1964, was memorialized by painter, Gerard Richardson.

After the manning experiment, &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; made deployments to the Mediterranean Sea from 1966 to 1973. She also made a northern European cruise in July 1972. &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in August 1973 and returned to Norfolk in January 1974. Shortly after her return, the ship entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a ten-month overhaul returning to service in January 1975. She completed refresher training and ship trials in the Caribbean Sea from March to May 1975.

=== Belknap collision ===

In July 1975, &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; served as the rescue unit and tied up alongside USS &quot;Belknap&quot; (CG-26) after her collision with USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; (CV-67) on the night of 22 November 1975. &quot;Belknap&quot; was ablaze with exploding ammunition from the storage lockers for her two 3-inch guns, but the crew of the &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; battled the conflagration for 7 hours and limited the damage, evacuating the injured while fragments from exploding ammunition showered down upon her decks. In the end, CG-26 was knocked and melted nearly to her main deck. Seven crew members aboard &quot;Belknap&quot; and one aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; were killed. A Navy Unit Commendation was awarded for service during the time period. &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; returned to Norfolk in January 1976.
On October 4, 1976, &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. There was also a trip to Kenya to commemorate the 13th anniversary of their independence. Just six weeks after returning to Norfolk, the ship deployed for a six-week operation with the Brazilian Navy. A Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded for service from 1 October 1976 to 30 September 1977. From September 1977 to October 1978, &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. She returned to Norfolk in April 1979 after refresher training and trials.

=== Iran Hostage Crisis ===
&quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed for seven months to the US Middle East Force and Sixth fleet at the start of September 1979. During the first part of the cruise, the ship made ports of call to Djibouti, Kenya, and Karachi, Pakistan On 4 November 1979, &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was making a port visit to Karachi, Pakistan when radical students invaded and occupied the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran and took the embassy staff hostage initiating the Iran hostage crisis. &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was immediately tasked to proceed to the Persian Gulf area of operations to join with and remained continuously at sea for more than 10 weeks over the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Holidays.Finally after 72 days of being at sea, ended with a two day visit in Sitra, Bahrain &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was back in the Mediterranean Sea in February 1980 and returned to Norfolk in April 1980. A Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded for service relating to the crisis from 21 November 1979 to 2 February 1980.
&quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed to Northern Europe in January 1981 and operated with the Standing Naval Force Atlantic. The ship visited 8 countries and 15 different cities and conducted exercises from Gibraltar to Norway, north of the Arctic Circle and west to Halifax, Nova Scotia. She returned to Norfolk in June 1981. A Meritorious Unit Commendation was awarded for service from 7 January 1981 to 24 June 1981.

==== Lebanon ====
During late 1983 and early 1984, &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed in support of operations of the coast of Lebanon in the months after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was awarded for three time periods relating to Lebanon during this deployment.
&quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in late 1987 and returned to Norfolk, 29 March 1988.

=== Decommissioning ===
&quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was decommissioned on 31 October 1989 at Norfolk Naval Station, Norfolk, VA, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1990 and sold for scrap on 15 April 1994, to NR Acquisitions of NYC and towed to Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s old Fairfield yard in Baltimore, MD for scrapping by Wilmington Resources, Inc. of Wilmington, NC. Sale price $184,550.66. The scrap contract was terminated on 1 October 1996, and the Navy repossessed the ship on 18 October, and returned to NISMF Philadelphia and the ship was resold to Metro Machine, Incorporated, of Philadelphia Pennsylvania on 5 December 2001 . Scrapping was completed on 8 November 2002.

<doc id="432536" wikidata="Q1548416" url="?curid=432536" title="Great Lakes region">
<text>The Great Lakes region of Northern America is a binational Canadian–American region centered around the Great Lakes that includes the U.S. states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and the Canadian province of Ontario. Canada&#x27;s Quebec province is at times included as part of the region because the St. Lawrence River watershed is part of the continuous hydrologic system. The region forms a distinctive historical, economic, and cultural identity. A portion of the region also encompasses the Great Lakes megalopolis.

State and provincial governments are represented in the Conference of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers, which also serves as the Secretariat to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Compact and the Great Lakes–Saint Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement.

The Great Lakes region takes its name from the corresponding geological formation of the Great Lakes Basin, a narrow watershed encompassing the Great Lakes, bounded by watersheds to the region&#x27;s north by the Hudson Bay, to the west by the Mississippi, and to the east and south by the Ohio. To the east, the rivers of St. Lawrence, Richelieu, Hudson, Mohawk and Susquehanna form an arc of watersheds east to the Atlantic.

The Great Lakes region, as distinct from the Great Lakes Basin, defines a unit of sub-national political entities defined by the U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario encompassing the Great Lakes watershed, and the states and province bordering one or more of the Great Lakes.

== Geography ==

The Palaeozoic strata are parts of a great area of similar layers hundreds of feet in thickness. These strata decline gently southward from the great upland of the Laurentian Highlands of eastern Canada. The visible upland area of today was a small part of the primeval continent with the remainder of it still buried under a Palaeozoic cover. The visible part was the last part of the primeval continent to sink under the advancing Palaeozoic seas. This district may be considered an ancient coastal plain. The weaker layers are worn down in sub-parallel belts of lower land between the upland and the belts of more resistant strata, which rise in uplands. Illustrations of this type of forms are found in the district of the Great Lakes. The chief upland belt or escarpment is formed by the firm Niagara limestone/dolomite, which takes its name from the gorge and falls cut through the upland by the Niagara River. The Niagara Escarpment has a relatively strong slope or enfacing escarpment on the side towards the upland, and a long gentle slope on the other side. Its relief is seldom more than 200 or and is generally small. Its continuity and its contrast with the associated lowlands on the underlying and overlying weak strata make it an important feature. The escarpment would lie straight east–west if the slant of the strata were uniformly to the south. However, the strata are somewhat warped and so the escarpment&#x27;s course is strongly convex to the north in the middle, gently convex to the south at either end.

The escarpment begins where its determining limestone/dolomite begins, in west-central New York. There, it separates the lowlands that separate Lake Ontario from Lake Erie. It curves to the northwest through the Ontario province to the island belt that divides the Georgian Bay from Lake Huron. From there, it heads westward through the land-arm between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan and southwestward into the narrow points dividing Green Bay from Lake Michigan. Finally, it fades away with the thinning out of the limestone and is hardly traceable across the Mississippi River. The arrangement of the Great Lakes closely matches the course of the lowlands worn on the two belts of weaker strata on either side of the Niagara escarpment. Lake Ontario, Georgian Bay and Green Bay occupy depressions in the lowland on the inner side of the escarpment. Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan lie in depressions in the lowland on the outer side. When the two lowlands are traced eastward, they become confluent after the Niagara limestone has faded away in central New York, and the single lowland is continued under the name of the Mohawk Valley. This is an east–west longitudinal depression that has been eroded on a belt of relatively weak strata between the resistant crystalline rocks of the Adirondacks on the north and the northern escarpment of the Appalachian Plateau (Catskills-Helderbergs) on the south. Early in U.S. history, this provided a vital economic route between the Atlantic seaports and the U.S. interior.

In Wisconsin, the inner lowland is a knob of resistant quartzites, known as Baraboo Ridge, rising from the buried upland floor through the partly denuded cover of lower Palaeozoic strata. This knob or ridge can be thought of as an ancient physiographic fossil, as it is an ancient monadnock having been preserved from destructive attacks of weather by burial under sea-floor deposits. It has been recently re-exposed through the erosion of its cover. The occurrence of the lake basins in the lowland belts on either side of the Niagara escarpment is an abnormal feature. Glacial erosion has formed them through the glacial drift obstructing the normal outlet valleys and to crustal warping in connection with or independent of the glacial sheet.

Lake Superior is unlike the other lakes. The greater part of its basin occupies a depression in the upland area, independent of the overlap of Palaeozoic strata. The western half of the basin occupies a trough of synclinal structure. The Great Lakes receive the drainage of a small peripheral land area, enclosed by a water-parting from the rivers that run to Hudson Bay or the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on the north and to the Gulf of Mexico on the south.

The three lakes of the middle group: Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Erie stand at practically the same level. Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are connected by the Straits of Mackinac with the Mackinac Bridge spanning the straits. Lake Huron and Lake Erie are connected by the St. Clair River and Detroit River, with the small Lake St. Clair between them. The land northeast of the rivers is undergoing a slow elevation. The Niagara River connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, with a fall of ( at the cataract) in , is thought to have been of recent origin, as an older river would have a mature valley. The original valley that is thought to have connected the two depressions through the Niagara Escarpment is thought to have been at the present route of the Welland Canal, and to have been completely filled with glacial drift. The same is true for the St. Lawrence, where there may not have been an original valley. The Ontarian River that was a precursor to Lake Ontario is thought to have drained westward, and the St. Lawrence drainage to have been created by subsidence due to the weight of the ice sheet.

== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian history ===
Paleo-Indian cultures were the earliest in North America, with a presence in the Great Plains and Great Lakes areas from about 12,000 BCE to around 8,000 BCE. Prior to European settlement, Iroquoian people lived around Lakes Erie and Ontario, Algonquian peoples around most of the rest, and a variety of other indigenous nation-peoples including the Menominee, Ojibwa, Illinois, Pottawatmie, Huron, Shawnee, Erie, Fox, Miami, Meskwaki and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago). With the first permanent European settlements in the early seventeenth century, all these nation-peoples developed an extensive fur trade with French, Dutch, and English merchants in the St. Lawrence, Hudson and Mohawk Valleys, and Hudson&#x27;s Bay, respectively.

=== European exploration and early settlement ===

The prospects of fur monopolies and discovery of a fabled Northwest Passage to Asia generated sporadic but intense competition among the three most powerful northwest Europe imperial nations to control the territory. A century and a half of naval and land wars among France, The Netherlands and Britain resulted finally in British control of the region, from the Ohio River to the Arctic, and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Beyond the region, North American claims remained disputed among Britain, France, Spain and Russia.

Britain defeated France decisively at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham near Quebec City in 1759, and the Treaty of Paris (1763) that ended The Seven Years&#x27; War, known in America as the French and Indian War ceded the entire region to the victor. Indian Reserve is the historical term for this largely uncolonized area set aside in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 for use by Native Americans, who already inhabited it. The British government had contemplated establishing an Indian barrier state in the portion of the reserve west of the Appalachian Mountains, and bounded by the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes. Britain&#x27;s claims were intensely disputed by a confederation of Indians during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, which induced major concessions to still sovereign Indian nations; and by the Iroquois Confederacy, whose six member nations-Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora-never conceded sovereignty to either Britain or, later, The United States.

During the American Revolution, the region was contested between Britain and rebellious American colonies. Hoping for favorable claims of territorial control in an eventual peace treaty with Britain, American adventurers led by Kentucky militia leader George Rogers Clark briefly occupied village settlements, including Cahokia, Kaskaskia and Vincennes unopposed, with passive support from Francophone inhabitants. In the Peace of Paris (1784) Britain ceded what became known as the Northwest Territory, the area bounded by Great Lakes, Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and the eastern colonies of New York and Pennsylvania, to the fledgling United States. Britain, which may have entertained ambitions to repossess the area if America failed to govern it, retained control over its forts and licensed fur trade for fifteen years. By well-established trade and military routes across the Great Lakes, the British continued to supply not only their own troops but a wide alliance of Native American nations through Detroit, Fort Niagara, Fort Michilimackinac, and so on, until these posts were turned over to the United States following the Jay Treaty (1794).

During the Confederacy Period of 1781–1789, the Continental Congress passed three ordinances whose authority was unclear regarding the region&#x27;s governance on the American side. The Land Ordinance of 1784 established the broad outlines of future governance. The territory would be divided into six states, which would be given broad powers of constitutional instituting, and admitted to the nation as equal members. The Land Ordinance of 1785 specified the manner in which land would be distributed in the Territory, favoring sale in small parcels to settlers who would work their own farms.

The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 defined the political protocols by which American states south of the lakes would enter the union as political equals with the original thirteen colonies. The ordinance, adopted in its final form just before the writing of the United States Constitution, was a sweeping, visionary proposal to create what was at the time a radical experiment in democratic governance and economy. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 prohibited slavery, restricted primogeniture, mandated universal public education, provided for affordable farm land to people who settled and improved it, and required peaceful, lawful treatment of the Indian population. The ordinance prohibited the establishment of state religion and established civic rights that foreshadowed the United States Bill of Rights. Civil rights included freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, trial by jury, and exemption from unreasonable search and seizure. States were authorized to organize constitutional conventions and petition for admission as states equal to the original thirteen. Five states evolved from its provisions: Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. The northeastern section of Minnesota, from the Mississippi to St. Croix River, also fell under ordinance jurisdiction and extended the constitution and culture of the Old Northwest to the Dakotas. The surge of settlement generated tension culminating in the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.

Britain, fearing that fast American settlement could lead to annexation of its western provinces, countered with the Constitutional Act 1791 granting limited self-government to Canadian provinces and creating two new provinces out of Canada: Lower Canada (today&#x27;s Quebec) and Upper Canada (Ontario).

=== Development of transportation ===
Settlement and economic expansion on both sides accelerated after the 1825 opening of The Erie Canal, an astonishingly successful public venture that effectively integrated markets and commerce between the Atlantic seaboard and the region. The region on both sides of the border became a vast research and design laboratory for agricultural machinery and techniques. Owner-operator family farms transformed both demographics and ecology into a vast terrain of farmlands, producing primarily wheat and corn. In western New York and northeast Ohio, the St. Lawrence, Mohawk, and Hudson rivers provided outlets for commercial corn and wheat, while The Ohio River let agricultural products from western Pennsylvania and southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois journey downstream to New Orleans. Mining, primarily soft metals of copper, zinc, and lead; and timber to supply rapidly expanding sawmills that supplied lumber for new settlements.

Agricultural and industrial production generated distinctive political and social cultures of independent republican producers, who consolidated an ideology of personal liberty, free markets, and great social visions, often expressed in religious terms and enthusiasms. The region&#x27;s alliance of antislavery with free soil movements contributed troops and agricultural goods that proved critical in the Union&#x27;s victory. The Homestead and Morrill Acts, donating federal land to extend the agrarian economic franchise, and support state universities, modeled western expansion and education for all future states.

The British-Canadian London Conference of 1866, and subsequent Constitution Act of 1867 analogously derived from political, and some military, turmoil in the former jurisdiction of Upper Canada, which was renamed and organized in the new dominion as the province of Ontario. Like the provisions of the ordinance, Ontario prohibited slavery, made provisions for land distribution to farmers who owned their own land, and mandated universal public education.

=== Immigration and industrialization ===
Industrial production, organization, and technology have made the region among the world&#x27;s most productive manufacturing centers. Nineteenth-century monopolies such as International Harvester, Standard Oil, and United States Steel established the pattern of American centralized industrial consolidation and eventual global dominance. The region hosted the world&#x27;s greatest concentrations of production for oil, coal, steel, automobiles, synthetic rubber, agricultural machinery, and heavy transport equipment. Agronomy industrialized as well, in meat processing, packaged cereal products, and processed dairy products. In response to disruptions and imbalances of power resulting from so vast a concentration of economic power, industrial workers organized the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a coherent agricultural cooperative movement, and the Progressive politics led by Wisconsin&#x27;s Governor and Senator Robert M. La Follette. State universities, professional social work, and unemployment and workers&#x27; compensation were some of the region&#x27;s permanent contributions to American social policy.

The Great Lakes region has produced globally influential breakthroughs in agricultural technology, transportation and building construction. Cyrus McCormick&#x27;s reaper, John Deere&#x27;s steel plow, Joseph Dart (Dart&#x27;s Elevator), and George Washington Snow&#x27;s balloon-frame construction are some of innovations that made significant, global impact. The University of Chicago and Case Western Reserve University figured prominently in developing nuclear power. Automobile manufacture developed simultaneously in Ohio and Indiana and became centered in the Detroit area of Michigan. Henry Ford&#x27;s movable assembly line drew on regional experience in meat processing, agricultural machinery manufacture, and the industrial engineering of steel in revolutionizing the modern era of mass production manufacturing. Chicago-based Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck companies complemented mass manufactures with mass retail distribution.

Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland carry important roles in the field of architecture. Chicago pioneered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building designed by William LeBaron Jenney. Engineering innovation established Chicago from that time on to become one of the world&#x27;s most influential epicenters of contemporary urban and commercial architecture. Equally influential was the 1832 invention of balloon-framing in Chicago which replaced heavy timber construction requiring massive beams and great woodworking skill with pre-cut timber. This new lumber could be nailed together by farmers and settlers who used it to build homes and barns throughout the western prairies and plains. Wisconsin-born, Chicago-trained Sullivan apprentice Frank Lloyd Wright designed prototypes for architectural designs from the commercial skylight atrium to suburban ranch house.

German-born Pennsylvania immigrant John A. Roebling invented steel wire rope, a pivotal part of suspension bridges he designed and whose construction he supervised in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Buffalo, based on earlier successful canal aqueducts. His most famous project was the Brooklyn Bridge. Contributions to modern transportation include the Wright brothers&#x27; early airplanes, designed and perfected in their Dayton, Ohio mechanics&#x27; workshops; distinctive Great Lakes freighters, and railroad beds constructed of wooden ties and steel rails. The early nineteenth century Erie Canal and mid-twentieth century St. Lawrence Seaway expanded the scale and capacity of massive water-born freight.

Agricultural associations joined the nineteenth century Grange, which in turn generated the agricultural cooperatives that defined much of rural political economy and culture throughout the region. Fraternal, ethnic, and civic organizations extended cooperatives and supported local ventures from insurance companies to orphanages and hospitals. The region was the political base, and provided much leadership political parties in the region.

The region&#x27;s greatest institutional contributions were major corporate, labor, educational and cooperative organizations. It hosted some of the most influential national and international corporations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century monopoly age, including John Deere Plow, McCormack Reaper, New York Central and Erie railroads, Carnegie Steel, U.S. Steel, International Harvester and Standard Oil.

=== 20th century ===

As a result of industrialization, the population became more concentrated into urban areas. In part to balance democratic representation against the economic and political power of these corporations, the region hosted industrial labor organization, consolidated agricultural cooperatives and state educational systems. The Big Ten Conference memorializes the nation&#x27;s first region in which every state sponsored major research, technical-agricultural, and teacher-training colleges and universities. The Congress of Industrial Organizations grew out of the region&#x27;s coal and iron mines; steel, automobile and rubber industries; and breakthrough strikes and contracts of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.

The role of government also grew during the early 20th century. In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally. As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies. During World War II, the region became the global epicenter of motorized land vehicles, including cars, trucks and jeeps, as well as a major supplier of engine, transmission, and electrical components to the wartime aeronautics industry. Despite extreme labor shortages, the region increased mechanization, and absorbed large numbers of women and immigrant labor, to increase its food production.

== Economy ==
=== Manufacturing ===
Navigable terrain, waterways, and ports spurred an unprecedented construction of transportation infrastructure throughout the region. The region is a global leader in advanced manufacturing and research and development, with significant innovations in both production processes and business organization. John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil set precedents for centralized pricing, uniform distribution, and controlled product standards through Standard Oil, which started as a consolidated refinery in Cleveland. Cyrus McCormick&#x27;s Reaper and other manufacturers of agricultural machinery consolidated into International Harvester in Chicago. Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s steel production integrated large-scale open-hearth and Bessemer processes into the world&#x27;s most efficient and profitable mills. The largest, most comprehensive monopoly in the world, United States Steel, consolidated steel production throughout the region. Many of the world&#x27;s largest employers began in the Great Lakes region.

Mass marketing in the modern sense was born in the region. Two competing Chicago retailers—Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck—developed mass marketing and sales through catalogues, mail-order distribution, and the establishment of their brand names as purveyors of consumer goods. The region&#x27;s natural features, cultural institutions, and resorts make it a popular destination for tourism.

Advantages of accessible waterways, highly developed transportation infrastructure, finance, and a prosperous market base make the region the global leader in automobile production and a global business location. Henry Ford&#x27;s movable assembly line and integrated production set the model and standard for major car manufactures. The Detroit area emerged as the world&#x27;s automotive center, with facilities throughout the region. Akron, Ohio became the global leader in rubber production, driven by the demand for tires. Over 200 million tons of cargo are shipped annually through the Great Lakes.

According to the Brookings Institution, if it stood alone as a country, the Great Lakes economy would be one of the largest economic units on Earth (with a $6-trillion gross regional product). This region also contains what area urban planners call the Great Lakes Megalopolis, which has an estimated 59 million people. Chicago is emerging as the third megacity in the United States, after the New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, with a metro population approaching ten million. Toronto is the largest city in Canada and the fourth largest city proper in North America behind Mexico City, New York City and Los Angeles. Cities along the Great Lakes have access to the Atlantic Ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway, making them international ports.

=== Financial ===

Chicago is the largest economic and financial center. Chicago was named the fourth most important business center in the world in the MasterCard Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index. The 2017 Global Financial Centres Index ranked Chicago as the twenty-fourth most competitive city in the world, behind Toronto, also in the Great Lakes region, at seventh. The Chicago Board of Trade (established 1848) listed the first ever standardized &quot;exchange traded&quot; forward contracts, which were called futures contracts. As a world financial center it is home to major financial and futures exchanges, including the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the &quot;Merc&quot;), which is owned, along with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) by Chicago&#x27;s CME Group. The CME Group, in addition, owns the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the Commodities Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and the Dow Jones Indexes., as well as headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (the Seventh District of the Federal Reserve).

Toronto is an international centre for business and finance. Generally considered the financial capital of Canada, Toronto has a high concentration of banks and brokerage firms on Bay Street, in the Financial District. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) is the world&#x27;s seventh-largest stock exchange by market capitalization. The five largest financial institutions of Canada, collectively known as the Big Five, have their global operational headquarters in Toronto.

Outside of Chicago and Toronto, many other cities are host to financial centers as well. Major bank headquarters are located in Ohio including Huntington Bancshares in Columbus, Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati, and KeyCorp in Cleveland. Insurance companies such as Anthem in Indianapolis, Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, American Family Insurance in Madison, Wisconsin, State Farm Insurance in Bloomington, Illinois, and Progressive Insurance and Medical Mutual of Ohio in Cleveland.

== Population centers ==

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===
The Great Lakes region has a strong, established Lutheran tradition (as established by populations from Nordic and Germanic countries), but this tradition has become more diversified in recent years.

=== Education ===

=== Sports ===
Large professional sports leagues such as the National Football League (NFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) have team franchises in several cities in the region.

=== Politics ===
Blue collar industry traditionally represents the Great Lakes region. In the United States, several states bordering the Great Lakes have been considered important swing states for presidential elections. The states typically do not vote for the same candidate, and have only done so seven times in the past 100 years: 1928, 1936, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, and 2008. In Ontario, it has long been divided between rural and urban districts, with many rural ridings voted more conservative, and larger urban and Suburban areas voting Liberal or NDP.

== Transportation ==
The Great Lake region is served by Interstate 94, Interstate 75, Ontario Highway 401, Amtrak and VIA Rail services.

The three largest international airports in the Great Lake region are Chicago O&#x27;Hare, Toronto Pearson, and Detroit Metro Airport. All three airports are major airline hubs that provide nonstop connectivity to other regions and continents.

<text>John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel, 4th Baron Maltravers (14 February 140812 June 1435) was an English nobleman and military commander during the later phases of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. His father, John Fitzalan, 3rd Baron Maltravers, fought a long battle to lay claim to the Arundel earldom, a battle that was not finally resolved until after the father&#x27;s death, when John Fitzalan the son was finally confirmed in the title in 1433.

Already before this, in 1430, Fitzalan had departed for France, where he held a series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. Fitzalan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place was a matter of dispute until the mid-nineteenth century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing one leg.

Arundel was considered a great soldier by his contemporaries. He had been a successful commander in France, in a period of decline for the English, and his death was a great loss to his country. He was succeeded by his son Humphrey, who did not live to adulthood. The title of Earl of Arundel then went to John&#x27;s younger brother, William.

==Family background==

John Fitzalan was born at Lytchett Matravers in Dorset on 14 February 1408. He was the son of John Fitzalan, 3rd Baron Maltravers (1385–1421) and Eleanor (d. 1455), daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverstone, Gloucestershire. John Fitzalan the elder, through his great-great-grandfather Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, made a claim on the earldom of Arundel after the death of Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel, in 1415. The claim was disputed, however, by Thomas&#x27;s three sisters and their families, foremost among these Elizabeth FitzAlan, who had married Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. It is debatable whether Maltravers ever held the title of Earl of Arundel; he was summoned to parliament under this title once, in 1416, but never again. When he died in 1421, the dispute continued under his son, and it was not until 1433 that the younger John FitzAlan finally had his title confirmed in parliament, despite the Mowbrays disputing his claim. Four years earlier, in July 1429, he had received his late father&#x27;s estates and title.

As a child, John Fitzalan was contracted to marry Constance, who was the daughter of John Cornwall, Baron Fanhope, and through her mother Elizabeth granddaughter of John of Gaunt. The two may or may not have married, but Constance was dead by 1429, when John married Maud, daughter of Robert Lovell. 

FitzAlan was knighted in 1426 along with the four-year-old King Henry VI, where he was referred to as &quot;Dominus de Maultravers&quot; (&quot;Lord Maltravers&quot;). In the summer of 1429, he was summoned to parliament, this time styled &quot;Johanni Arundell&#x27; Chivaler&quot;, meaning he was now Lord Arundel. 

In 1430, however, in an indenture for service with the king in France, he was styled Earl of Arundel, a title he also used himself. When he was finally officially recognised in his title of Earl of Arundel in 1433, this was based on the recognition that the title went with the possession of Arundel Castle. In reality though, the grant was just as much a reward for the military services he had by that point rendered in France.

==Service in France==

John Fitzalan the father had been a prominent soldier in the Hundred Years&#x27; War under King Henry V, and the son followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps. On 23 April 1430, the younger Fitzalan departed for France in the company of the Earl of Huntingdon. There he soon made a name for himself as a soldier, under the command of the king&#x27;s uncle, John, Duke of Bedford. In June, he took part in the Siege of Compiègne, where Joan of Arc had recently been captured. Later, he raised the siege of Anglure with the help of the Burgundians. On 17 December 1431, he was present when Henry VI was crowned King of France in Paris, where he distinguished himself at the accompanying tournament. FitzAlan&#x27;s military success led to several important appointments of command; in November 1431, he was made lieutenant of the Rouen garrison, and shortly after also captain of Vernon. In January 1432 he was appointed captain of Verneuil. On the night of 3 February he was taken by surprise while in bed at the Great Tower of Rouen Castle, when a band of French soldiers from nearby Ricarville managed to take the castle. Arundel was hoisted down the walls in a basket, and made his escape. The assailants could not hold the castle, because Marshall Boussac refused to garrison the town; Guillaume de Ricarville was forced to surrender twelve days later. In April 1432, FitzAlan was rewarded for his actions so far by initiation into the Order of the Garter. In a separate action from Rouen Arundel was sent to rescue Saint Lo. from an attack by the duke of Alençon&#x27;s army, after the town&#x27;s captain Raoul Tesson had been appointed to replace Suffolk, who was captured at the Battle of Jargeau. The French retreated to the fastness of Mont St Michel, from where they continued to raid Anglo-Norman towns, like Granville in 1433.

From early 1432 onwards, Fitzalan held several regional commands in northern France. One of his tasks was recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, at which he was mostly successful. At Lagny-sur-Marne he blew up the bridge to prevent the citizens from reaching the castle, but still failed to take the fortification. In December he was appointed to a regional command in Upper Normandy, but had to defend the town of Sées from a siege. On 10 March 1433, he issued a pardon to the inhabitants when the town was retaken from the Armagnacs.

In July Arundel was instead made lieutenant-general of Lower Normandy. The earl continued his work of recovering lost fortresses that belonged to Ambroise de Loré, Bonsmoulins was taken easily, but Loré&#x27;s family had occupied Saint-Céneri. After three months of culverin bombardment, the walls were breached and most of the garrison killed. The remainder were allowed to march out unharmed.

In the County of Alençon, a young, tall and courageous earl led the campaign that probably took place in 1433, taking back Saint-Célerin, Sillé-le-Guillaume, where there was a short skirmish. The Armagnacs arrived, and demanded the return of the hostages in the castle; Arundel feigned to agree and departed. As soon as the Armagnacs rode off Arundel returned and took the castle by assault. and by 1434 Beaumont-le-Vicomte. In December 1433, Bedford again appointed him commander in Upper Normandy, as well as captain of Pont-de-l&#x27;Arche.

By now the Earl of Arundel might have returned briefly to England in May 1434, when he was in the process of gathering troops for an English expedition to France. But John, Duke of Bedford was forced to raise loans for the soldiers&#x27; pay in the Maine campaign. That Spring he was joined in Paris by John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury with nearly 1000 reinforcements from England. Later in May he was replaced as lieutenant of Upper Normandy by Talbot, and instead received a command between the Seine and Loire rivers. This effectively meant that the two shared the command of Normandy, with Talbot east of the Seine and Arundel to the west. But they combined operations capturing Beaumont-sur-Oise, and then Creil, which was finally taken on 20 June 1434. In the summer Arundel captured the Mantes-Chartres regional fortresses; it appeared for a time at least the Armagnacs no longer posed a threat to Paris.

On 8 September, Arundel was also made Duke of Touraine – an area held by the French. The grant was made as a reward for his good service, but also in the hope that he would campaign in the area. In October he was made captain of Saint-Lô, where he had to deal with a rebellion in the Bessin area. The Duke of Alençon was trying to exploit the revolt to take control of Avranches, but Arundel managed to prevent the French advance and ended the rebellion.

But in early 1435 the area of western Normandy erupted in popular revolt. Arundel was summoned to call muster from Rouen in order to protect Caen. Arundel was joined by another lieutenant-general, Lord Scales, from his base at Domfront, commanded to relieve Avranches. Alençon intended to build a fortress at Savigny-le-Vieux, but when the English found out, the bailli of Cotentin was required to demolish it. With 800 men, Arundel was sent to recover Rue, where he learnt that La Hire was fortifying Gerberoy, only 37 miles east of Rouen. Talbot had previously cleared out the Picardy, but when Arundel arrived he discovered to his surprise La Hire and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles had already occupied the fortress. He was forced to give battle or besiege.

==Death and aftermath==

On the night of 31 May/1 June 1435, Arundel was at Mantes-la-Jolie in the Île-de-France, when he was ordered to relocate north to Gournay-sur-Epte (now Gournay-en-Bray). When he was informed that the French had taken over the nearby fortress at Gerberoy, he moved quickly to attack it. The English met with a large French force at Gerberoy. Many withdrew to Gournay in panic, but Arundel remained to fight. In the ensuing battle, Arundel lost many of his men and was himself hit in the foot by a shot from a culverin, a primitive musket. Heavily wounded, he was taken to Beauvais as a captive of the French. According to the French historian Thomas Basin, Arundel was humiliated by his defeat and refused to receive medical treatment for the damage to his foot. The leg was eventually amputated, but Arundel&#x27;s life could not be saved; he died of his injuries on 12 June 1435, depriving the English of one of their youngest, most able and dedicated military leaders. Arundel was replaced in his command by Lord Scales.

There was long uncertainty about what had happened to the earl&#x27;s body. The French chronicler Jehan de Waurin claimed that Arundel had simply been buried in Beauvais. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the chaplain of the Duke of Norfolk came upon the will of Arundel&#x27;s squire, Fulk Eyton, when he died later in 1454. Eyton maintained therein that he had secured the earl&#x27;s body and brought it back to England, for which he had been rewarded with a payment of 1400 Marks. The body was disinterred, brought back to England, and then entombed in the Fitzalan Chapel of Arundel Castle, as Arundel had expressly wished for in his own will. On 16 November 1857, the tomb in the Arundel chapel carrying the earl&#x27;s effigy was opened. In it was found a skeleton measuring over six feet, with a missing leg.

Arundel&#x27;s military career coincided with a period of general decline for the English in France. He had been an unusually successful campaigner. His death was lamented in England and celebrated in France. He was referred to as the &quot;English Achilles&quot;; the historian Polydore Vergil called him &quot;a man of singular valour, constancy, and gravity&quot;. With his wife, Maud, he had a son, Humphrey, who was born on 30 January 1429. Humphrey succeeded to his father&#x27;s title, but died on 24 April 1438, while still a minor. John FitzAlan&#x27;s younger brother, William, was next in line of succession. William was born in 1417 and was created Earl of Arundel in 1438 when he came of age.

<text>The Upper Midwest is a northern subregion of the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s Midwestern United States. Although the exact boundaries are not uniformly agreed upon, the region is usually defined to include the states of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin; some definitions include North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Nebraska and Illinois.

==Definitions==
The National Centers for Environmental Information considers the Upper Midwest climate region to include Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The United States Geological Survey uses two different Upper Midwest regions:

*The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center considers it to be the six states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, which comprise the watersheds of the Upper Mississippi River and upper Great Lakes.
*The USGS Mineral Resources Program considers the area to contain Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

The Association for Institutional Research in the Upper Midwest includes the states of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan in the region. According to the Library of Congress, the Upper Midwest includes the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

==Climate==
The region has dramatic variations between summer and winter temperatures; summers are hot; and winters are very cold. For example, Sioux Falls averages 25 days each year with temperatures above and 45 days each year with temperatures below . Mitchell, South Dakota has a record high of and a record low of .

The growing season is shorter, cooler and drier in areas farther north and west. The region&#x27;s western boundary is sometimes considered to be determined by where the climate becomes too dry to support growing non-irrigated crops other than small grains or hay grass.

==Language==

The Inland North dialect, most prominently characterized by the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, is centered in the eastern part of the Upper Midwest, including Wisconsin, Michigan and the northern parts of Illinois and Ohio; it extends beyond the Midwest into Upstate New York. North Central American English (also known as &quot;Upper Midwestern&quot;), an accent of American English defined more by the absence of certain features than their presence, is spoken in Minnesota, parts of Wisconsin and Iowa, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, portions of Montana and the Dakotas.

==Politics==
The Upper Midwest in the 20th-century was dominated by the Republican Party and was the heartland of the early Progressive movement, the region supporting Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Bull Moose party and Robert La Follette&#x27;s Progressive party. The region continues to be favorable to the Democratic Party and moderate Republicans, with Minnesota favoring each Democratic presidential candidate since 1976 and Wisconsin from 1988 to 2012 (and again in 2020). Minnesota narrowly supported native Walter Mondale in 1984 in an election where Ronald Reagan won every other state. Michigan and Illinois also often favor Democratic candidates. However, beginning with the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans experienced substantial gains in state legislative and executive offices in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This trend continued through 2016. From 2018, Democrats regained some control of the region. Upper Midwest states closest to the Great Lakes favor Democrats, and Democratic state trifecta governments formed in Minnesota and Michigan in 2022. Great Plains states in the region continue to favor Republicans, with GOP state trifecta governments in the Dakota&#x27;s and Iowa. In 2023, the region had three Democratic governors (in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) and three Republican governors (in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa).

In the 2020 presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden won the electoral votes of the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. Republican Donald Trump won the electoral votes of Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

Every American state elects two U.S. senators to a six-year term. After the November 2020 election, Minnesota and Michigan had two Democratic senators, while North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa had two Republican senators. Wisconsin is the only state in the Upper Midwest that has elected one Republican and one Democratic senator.

==Industry and tourism==

The economy of the region was largely based upon the mining of iron and copper, as well as a very large timber industry. Mechanization has sharply reduced employment in those areas, and the economy is increasingly based on tourism. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience who live within driving range.

=== Agriculture ===

The USDA reported that corn, soybean, sunflower and sugar beet crops saw harvest gains in 2018, but were still below the five-year averages. In North Dakota, for example, 49% of corn was harvested by November 4 compared with the five-year average of 97%. This was in part due to weather conditions in October that affected the harvest.

<doc id="432556" wikidata="Q1053826" url="?curid=432556" title="Central Hockey League">
<text>The Central Hockey League (CHL) was a North American mid-level minor professional ice hockey league which operated from 1992 until 2014. It was founded by Ray Miron and Bill Levins and later sold to Global Entertainment Corporation, which operated the league from 2000 to 2013, at which point it was purchased by the individual franchise owners. As of the end of its final season in 2014, three of the 30 National Hockey League teams had affiliations with the CHL: the Dallas Stars, Minnesota Wild, and Tampa Bay Lightning.

Several teams of defunct leagues joined the CHL along its history, including the Southern Hockey League, Western Professional Hockey League and International Hockey League. After two teams suspended operations during the 2014 offseason, the ECHL accepted the remaining seven teams as members in October 2014, meaning the end for the CHL after 22 seasons.

==History==

The Central Hockey League (CHL) was revived in 1992 by Ray Miron and the efforts of Bill Levins, with the idea of central ownership of both the league and the teams. Both men were from hockey backgrounds. Miron had been general manager of the Colorado Rockies (now the New Jersey Devils), and had briefly been president of the previous Central Hockey League in 1976. In the inaugural 1992–93 season the league had six teams, including the Oklahoma City Blazers, the Tulsa Oilers, the Wichita Thunder, the Memphis RiverKings, the Dallas Freeze and the Fort Worth Fire.

After Levins died, the league&#x27;s championship trophy (awarded to the winner of the CHL playoffs) was renamed the Levins Cup. After running the league for eight years, Miron retired in 2000 and sold the league. The Levins Cup was renamed the Ray Miron President&#x27;s Cup. After experiments in expansion and an ongoing battle for players and markets with the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) throughout the late 1990s, the CHL merged with the WPHL in 2001, with 10 former WPHL teams joining the CHL for the 2001–02 season. However, several years of gradual contraction in the former WPHL markets claimed most of these teams in the ensuing years. The last active former WPHL team, the Fort Worth Brahmas, effectively ceased operations following the 2012–13 season. Subsequently, in 2010, the International Hockey League folded and all five remaining IHL teams joined the CHL; the last of these, the Quad City Mallards, folded in 2018 in the ECHL.

Brad Treliving, who co-founded the WPHL in 1996, became CHL commissioner following the merger, before leaving to join the Phoenix Coyotes. Duane Lewis was named the permanent commissioner in June 2008. In October 2013, the CHL appointed former president of the Pittsburgh Penguins Steve Ryan to succeed Lewis.

On March 8, 2013, the Central Hockey League announced an expansion team in Brampton, Ontario. The Brampton Beast would become the first Canadian team in the CHL&#x27;s history. In October 2013, the Central Hockey League was purchased from Global Entertainment by all the team owners, putting the CHL business model in line with that of the NHL and AHL.

On May 2, 2014 the St. Charles Chill ceased operations. Soon after, the Arizona Sundogs and Denver Cutthroats suspended operations. On October 7, 2014, it was announced that the ECHL had accepted the Central Hockey League&#x27;s remaining seven teams as members for the 2014–15 season, officially signaling the end of the Central Hockey League after 22 seasons. 

===Legacy===

The Allen Americans, who won the last two CHL President&#x27;s Cups, won two consecutive ECHL titles following the folding of the Central Hockey League.

The Mississippi RiverKings, Tulsa Oilers and Wichita Thunder were the last of the original six franchises still playing at the end of the CHL&#x27;s tenure; the RiverKings since folded, in 2018. In the 2014–15 season, ten teams (Allen, Brampton, Colorado, Evansville, Fort Wayne, Missouri, Quad City, Rapid City, Tulsa, and Wichita) were in the ECHL, two teams (Mississippi and Columbus) were in the SPHL, and four organizations (Corpus Christi, Fort Worth Brahmas, Odessa, and Rio Grande Valley) fielded junior teams in the NAHL.

Of the CHL&#x27;s remaining teams prior to October 7, 2014, Tulsa, Wichita, Allen, Colorado, Fort Wayne, Missouri (now Kansas City), and Rapid City are still active as of 2023.

Of the CHL&#x27;s six original teams from the 1992-1993 inaugural season, only the Tulsa Oilers and Wichita Thunder remain and are still active as of 2023.

<doc id="432559" wikidata="Q932075" url="?curid=432559" title="Earl of Devon">
<text>Earl of Devon is a title that has been created several times in the Peerage of England. It was possessed first (after the Norman Conquest of 1066) by the Redvers family (&quot;alias&quot; de Reviers, Revieres, etc.), and later by the Courtenay family. It is not to be confused with the title of Earl of Devonshire, which is held by the Duke of Devonshire, although the letters patent for the creation of the latter peerages used the same Latin words, &quot;Comes Devon(iae)&quot;. It was a re-invention, if not an actual continuation, of the pre-Conquest office of Ealdorman of Devon.

Close kinsmen and powerful allies of the Plantagenet kings, especially Edward III, Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V, the Earls of Devon were treated with suspicion by the Tudors, perhaps unfairly, partly because William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1475–1511), had married Princess Catherine of York, a younger daughter of King Edward IV, bringing the Earls of Devon very close to the line of succession to the English throne. During the Tudor period, all but the last Earl were attainted, and there were several recreations and restorations. The last recreation was to the heirs male of the grantee, not (as would be usual) to the heirs male of his body. When he died unmarried, it was assumed the title was extinct, but a much later very distant Courtenay cousin, of the family seated at Powderham, whose common ancestor was Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (d.1377), seven generations before this Earl, successfully claimed the title in 1831. During this period of dormancy, the &quot;de jure&quot; Earls of Devon, the Courtenays of Powderham, were created baronets and later viscounts.

During this time, an unrelated earldom of a similar name, now called for distinction the Earldom of Devonshire, was created twice, once for Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, who had no legitimate children, and a second time for the Cavendish family, now Dukes of Devonshire. Unlike the Dukes of Devonshire, seated in Derbyshire, the Earls of Devon were strongly connected to the county of Devon. Their seat is Powderham Castle, near Starcross on the River Exe.

The Earl of Devon has not inherited the ancient and original Barony of Courtenay or the Viscountcy of Courtenay of Powderham (1762–1835); nevertheless, his heir is styled Lord Courtenay by courtesy.

==Ealdormen of Devon==

Before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the highest sub-regal authority in Devon was the Ealdorman, of which office the later Earldom of Devon was a re-invention, if not an actual continuation.

*Odda, under Alfred the Great, led Anglo-Saxon forces in the Battle of Cynwit, ultimately defeating an army led by Viking chieftain Ubba.
*Ordgar (d.971), under King Edgar (ruled 959–975). He founded Tavistock Abbey in 961. His son was Ordwulf (died after 1005), who realised the founding.

==The post-Norman earldom==
The first Earl of Devon was Baldwin de Redvers (–1155), son of Richard de Redvers (d.1107), feudal baron of Plympton, Devon, one of the principal supporters of King Henry I (1100–1135). It was believed by some that Richard de Redvers had in fact been created the first Earl of Devon, and although in the past this caused confusion concerning the numerical ordering of the Earls of Devon, the point is now more clearly settled in favour of Baldwin as the first. Baldwin de Redvers was a great noble in Devon and the Isle of Wight, where his seat was Carisbrooke Castle, and was one of the first to rebel against King Stephen (1135–1154). He seized Exeter Castle, and mounted naval raids from Carisbrooke, but was driven out of England to Anjou, France, where he joined the Empress Matilda. She created him Earl of Devon after she established herself in England, probably in early 1141.

Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon, was succeeded by his son, Richard de Redvers, 2nd Earl of Devon, and grandson, Baldwin de Redvers, 3rd Earl of Devon, and the latter was succeeded by his brother, Richard de Redvers, 4th Earl of Devon, who died childless.

William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217) was the third son of Baldwin, the 1st Earl. He had only two children who left children. His son Baldwin died on 1 September 1216 at the age of sixteen, leaving his wife Margaret pregnant with Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon. King John (1199–1216) forced her to marry Falkes de Breauté, but she was rescued at the fall of Bedford Castle in 1224 and divorced from him, as having been in no true marriage. She is thus called Countess of Devon in several records. The fifth Earl&#x27;s youngest daughter, Mary de Redvers, known as &#x27;de Vernon&#x27;, was eventually the sole heiress of the 1141 Earldom. She married firstly, Pierre de Preaux, and secondly, Robert de Courtenay (d.1242), feudal baron of Okehampton, Devon.

The 6th Earl was succeeded by his son, Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon (d.1262), who died without children. His sister, Isabel de Forz, widow of William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle, became Countess of Devon &quot;suo jure&quot;. Her children predeceased her and she had no grandchildren.

Her lands were inherited by her second cousin once removed, Hugh de Courtenay (1276–1340), feudal baron of Okehampton, the great-grandson of Mary de Redvers and Robert de Courtenay (d.1242) of Okehampton. He descended from Renaud de Courtenay, anglicised to Reginald I de Courtenay, of Sutton, a French nobleman of the House of Courtenay who took up residence in England after the conquest and founded the English branch of the Courtenay family, who became Earls of Devon in 1335. The title is still held today, by his direct male descendant.

Hugh de Courtenay was summoned by writ to Parliament in 1299 as &quot;Hugo de Curtenay&quot;, whereby he is held to have become Baron Courtenay. However, forty-one years after the death of Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon|Isabel de Forz, letters patent were issued on 22 February 1335 declaring him Earl of Devon, and stating that he &quot;should assume such title and style as his ancestors, Earls of Devon, had wont to do&quot;, by which he was confirmed as Earl of Devon. Although some sources consider this a new grant the wording of the grant arguably indicates a confirmation and that he became thereby 9th Earl. Historic sources thus variously refer to him as either 1st Earl or 9th Earl, and the position cannot be decided either way due to the uncertainty of the surviving evidence. For the last years of his life he thus held two titles, 1st/9th Earl of Devon, by reason of the 1335 letters patent, and 1st Baron Courtenay, the title by which he had been summoned to Parliament in the years prior to the 1335 letters patent.

The 1st/9th Earl was succeeded by his son, Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd/10th Earl of Devon. Three of the eight sons of the 2nd/10th Earl had descendants; a fourth, William Courtenay, was Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. Sir Hugh Courtenay (1326–1349), KG, eldest son and heir of the 2nd/10th Earl, was one of the founding members of the Order of the Garter, but both he and his only son, Sir Hugh Courtenay (died 1374), predeceased the 2nd/10th Earl. Sir Edward de Courtenay (died 1368/71), the third son, also predeceased his father, but left an eldest son, Edward de Courtenay, 3rd Earl of Devon (1357–1419), &quot;The Blind&quot;, who inherited as the 3rd/11th Earl. The 3rd/11th Earl&#x27;s eldest son, Sir Edward Courtenay (died 1418), married Eleanor Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, but predeceased his father, leaving no children, and the 3rd/11th Earl&#x27;s second son, Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon (d.1422) succeeded him as became 4th/12th Earl of Devon. The 4th/12th Earl was succeeded by his son, Thomas Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon (d.1458).

The Wars of the Roses were disastrous for the Courtenay earls. The 5th/13th Earl&#x27;s son, Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon (d.1461), fought on the losing Lancastrian side at the Battle of Towton (1461), was captured and beheaded, and all his honours forfeited by attainder. Tiverton Castle and all the other vast Courtenay lands were forfeited to the crown, later to be partially restored.

==Second creation, 1469==
Edward IV had made Humphrey Stafford, grandson and heir of Humphrey Stafford of Hooke, Dorset, his agent in the West Country. On 17 May 1469, Stafford was created Earl of Devon, but was killed only three months later, having led royal forces against the rebel army of Robin of Redesdale, a deputy of the Earl of Warwick. Captured in the Battle of Edgecote, he was beheaded at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. He left no children, and with his death the second creation of the earldom became extinct. He is known as the &quot;Three Months&#x27; Earl&quot;.

==Restored first creation, 1470==

The Wars of the Roses continued and in 1470 the Lancastrian forces under Warwick prevailed, and Henry VI was restored to the throne. The 1461 attainders were reversed, and the earldom of Devon was restored to John Courtenay, 7th/15th Earl of Devon (d.1471), youngest brother of Thomas, the 6th/14th Earl. There had been a middle brother also, Henry Courtenay (d.1469), who also perished in the Wars. When the Yorkists again prevailed in the following year, Edward IV had the legislation of Henry VI&#x27;s second reign cancelled, and all of John Courtenay&#x27;s honours were forfeited. A few weeks later, on 4 May 1471, he died fighting on the losing side at the Battle of Tewkesbury (1471), leaving no children. According to Cokayne, &quot;on his death the representation of the ancient Earls of Devon (of the family of Reviers from whom the Courtenays had inherited it) and of the Barony of Courtenay (created by the writ of 1299) fell into abeyance between his sisters or their descendants, subject to the attainder of Edward IV (1461), which revived on that King&#x27;s re-accession 14 April 1471&quot;.

==Third creation, 1485==

Sir Edward Courtenay (d.1509), great-nephew of the 3rd/11th Earl, fought on the winning side at Bosworth on 22 August 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and two months later the new King, Henry VII (1485–1509), by letters patent dated 16 October 1485, created Edward Courtenay Earl of Devon (or Devonshire), with the usual remainder to the heirs male of his body. As the son and heir of Sir Hugh Courtenay (died 1471/2) of Bocconoc, Sir Edward Courtenay was the heir male of his family, his father being the son and heir of Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccombe, younger brother of Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon (d.1419), &quot;The Blind&quot;. He united the Tiverton and Powderham lines of the family, having married Elizabeth Courtenay, a daughter of a younger son of the Powderham line. He died 28 May 1509, when the earldom was forfeited by the attainder in 1504 of his son and heir, William Courtenay (d.1511).

==Fourth creation, 1511==
William Courtenay (d.1511) had married Princess Catherine of York, a younger daughter of King Edward IV, and was thus brother-in-law to Elizabeth of York but nonetheless Elizabeth&#x27;s husband Henry VII had Courtenay imprisoned and attainted for his supposed, but unproven, complicity in the conspiracy of Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk. However, during the reign of his son and successor King Henry VIII (1509–1547) William Courtenay was gradually forgiven. His lands were restored as far as was possible, and by letters patent of 10 May 1511, he was created Earl of Devon with remainder to the heirs of his body. He died suddenly of pleurisy a month later on 11 June 1511, leaving his only surviving son, Henry Courtenay (d.1539), to inherit the earldom.

In December 1512 Henry Courtenay (d.1539) obtained by Act of Parliament the reversal of the 1504 attainder of his father, William Courtenay. In 1512 he thus inherited the earldom of Devon as held by his grandfather, having at his father&#x27;s death the previous year already inherited the earldom conferred by patent on his father in 1511. In 1525 he was created Marquess of Exeter by Henry VIII. However, in 1538 he was tried, convicted, attainted and beheaded by the same king for conspiring with the Poles and Nevilles against the government of Thomas Cromwell in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace. All his titles were forfeited by his attainder.

==Fifth creation, 1553==
Edward Courtenay (d.1556), Henry Courtenay&#x27;s second but only surviving son, was a prisoner in the Tower of London for fifteen years, from the time of his father&#x27;s arrest to the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary (1553–1558), when he was released and created by her Earl of Devon. The patent differed from earlier patents in that it granted the earldom to his heirs male forever, rather than to the heirs male of his body. (This meant, as was decided in 1831, that the earldom could pass to his cousins, the Courtenays of Powderham, more specifically to William IV Courtenay (1527–1557), known retrospectively as the &quot;de jure&quot; 2nd Earl, which family had existed since the 14th century at that seat as prominent country gentry.) He was proposed as a prospective husband for his cousin Queen Mary, herself keen on the match, but is said to have refused her advances, after which Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain. He was considered as a possible husband for her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth I. This made him a threat to Mary&#x27;s reign. Moreover, he was implicated in Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, and was again locked up in the Tower. In 1555 he was permitted to travel to Italy, where he died at Padua in 1556, possibly due to poisoning. With his death, his male line was extinguished, and the earldom with it, or so it was considered until 1831.

==Interregnum==
Since there was no Earl of Devon, James I granted the title in 1603 to Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, whose aunt had been the last Earl&#x27;s mother. He died without legitimate children three years later, and the King gave (or rather sold) the Earldom to William Cavendish, 1st Baron Cavendish.

Meanwhile, the descendants of Sir Philip Courtenay (1340–1406), of Powderham, a younger son of the 2nd/10th Earl, having fought against the Courtenay Earls during the Wars of the Roses, lived under the Tudors as prominent country gentlemen. The baronetcy was created in the Baronetage of England during the English Civil War in February 1644 for William VI Courtenay (1628–1702) &quot;de jure&quot; 5th Earl of Devon, of Powderham, Devon. The third baronet gained the title Viscount Courtenay of Powderham in 1762.

In 1831, the senior living Courtenay of this line was William Courtenay, 3rd Viscount Courtenay (died 1835), an aged rake and bachelor, then living in exile in Paris, having fled a bill of indictment. Were he to die unmarried, the viscountcy would become extinct, while the baronetcy would be inherited by his third cousin, another William Courtenay (1777–1859), who was Clerk Assistant to Parliament and High Steward of Oxford University. William Courtenay (d.1859) persuaded the House of Lords that &quot;heir male&quot; in the last 1553 creation of the title had meant &quot;heir male collateral&quot;, and that his cousin the 3rd Viscount was therefore also 9th Earl of Devon, and his ancestors the Courtenays of Powderham had been &quot;de jure&quot; Earls of Devon from 1556. William Courtenay (died 1859) duly succeeded his cousin as 10th Earl in 1835, and from him, the present Earls are descended. (A madman, John Nichols Thom, claimed to be &quot;Sir William Courtenay&quot; in 1832, and stood for Parliament twice, as representative of the extreme Philosophical Radicals, and proclaimed his right to the Earldom. He organized an agricultural rising outside Canterbury in 1838, and was shot dead in the Battle of Bossenden Wood during its suppression.)

The inconvenience, since 1831, of having two Earls for the same county has been dealt with thus: The Cavendish Earls, who were elevated to a Dukedom in 1694, had been spelling their title Duke of Devonshire; the ancient Earls had usually been Earls of Devon. This is due in part to the differences between English and &quot;law Latin&quot;, the language in which royal decrees were traditionally written. This has now become the difference between the two peerages, and it is convenient to call the Blount Earl (1603–06) Earl of Devonshire also.

==Residences==
The principal seat of the Earls of Devon until the expiry of the senior line in 1556 was Tiverton Castle in Devon, and as a subsidiary seat Colcombe Castle, Devon, both of which are now largely demolished. The Earls of Devon created after 1556, or in existence &quot;de jure&quot;, had occupied the manor of Powderham in Devon since the late 14th century, and Powderham Castle continues to be the principal seat of the present Earl of Devon.

==Earls of Devon of the early Courtenay line==

The ordinal number given to the early Courtenay Earls of Devon depends on whether the earldom is deemed a new creation by the letters patent granted 22 February 1334/5 or whether it is deemed a restitution of the old dignity of the de Redvers family.

†: 1553 creation was with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever, so theoretically succeeded by his sixth cousin once removed; thus the 1831 revival was to the ninth member of the family with respect to said creation.

<doc id="432561" wikidata="Q2249117" url="?curid=432561" title="California Highway Patrol">
<text>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) is the principal state police agency for the U.S. state of California. The CHP has primary jurisdiction, including patrol and investigations, over all California freeways and state property. Additionally, the CHP is responsible for the enforcement of all laws regulating the operation of vehicles on highways, including all roadways, outside incorporated city limits. The CHP can exercise law enforcement powers anywhere within the state.

The California State Legislature originally established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the Division of Motor Vehicles in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor C. C. Young on August 14, 1929. It was subsequently established as a separate department with legislation signed by Governor Earl Warren in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller California State Police in 1995. It is currently organized as part of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA).

In addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the California State Capitol) and guarding state officials. The CHP also works with municipal and federal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol and other aspects of law enforcement.

The California Highway Patrol is the largest state police agency in the United States, with 11,000 employees, over 7,600 of whom are sworn, according to a study in December 2019.

The CHP gained international recognition in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, through the broadcast of the TV series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, which chronicled the adventures of two fictional CHP motorcycle officers.

==Duties==
The CHP is responsible for public safety and law enforcement on all freeways and expressways, throughout the state, regardless of whether the freeway is within the boundaries of an incorporated city. Additionally, the CHP is responsible for the enforcement of all laws regulating the operation of vehicles, and the use of the highways and public roads in unincorporated portions of a county. Local police or the local sheriff&#x27;s department having a contract with an incorporated city are primarily responsible for investigating and enforcing traffic laws within the boundaries of an incorporated city; however, any peace officer of the CHP may enforce any state law anywhere within the state, even though the agency&#x27;s primary mission is related to transportation. Furthermore, CHP officers act as bailiffs for the California Supreme Court and the six California Courts of Appeal, and also provide security at buildings occupied by the State of California.
CHP officers enforce the California Vehicle Code, pursue fugitives spotted on the highways, and attend to all significant obstructions and crashes within their jurisdiction. CHP officers are responsible for investigating and disposing of car accidents, disabled vehicles, debris, and other impediments to the flow of traffic. They are often the first responders at the scene of an accident (or obstruction), and in turn summon paramedics, firefighters, tow truck drivers, or Caltrans personnel. The CHP files traffic crash reports for state highways and within unincorporated areas. The CHP responds to and investigates all accidents involving school buses throughout the state including incorporated cities.

CHP also has Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Teams (MAIT) for the investigation of complex traffic crashes.

Officers patrol in various vehicles including the 2014-2021 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, 2016-2023 Dodge Charger, and in 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe. In alternate duties, Officers have been utilizing some police cars from the early 2000s such as Ford Expeditions. Mobile Road Enforcement (MRE) Officers delegated with enforcing commercial vehicles utilize the 2016 Ford F:250 and 2016-2023 Ram 1500.

==Special responsibilities==

The CHP also publishes data on traffic accidents in California from a database called SWITRS (Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System).

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the CHP became responsible for securing and patrolling a number of potential terrorist targets in California. These sites include nuclear power plants, government buildings, and key infrastructure sites. The CHP also maintains a SWAT team on 24‑hour stand‑by to respond to any terrorist activity.

In September 2005, the CHP sent its two Mobile Field Forces (highly trained and equipped quick reaction/deployment teams for civil disturbances and/or disasters) to the Gulf Coast to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Before the National Guard arrived, the CHP had four patrol helicopters over Marianna, Florida, more than eighty vehicles on the ground, and more than 200 officers and other staff, including a SWAT team, deployed in New Orleans.

The CHP also has officers assigned to drug task forces and other criminal investigative task forces throughout the state, and maintains highly trained Warrant Service Teams (WST) throughout each of its Divisions. These teams serve high-risk felony arrest and search warrants generated as a result of CHP investigations, and the WST assists local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to serve the same type of high-risk warrants. CHP investigators also work closely with agents of the State Bureau of Investigation, Office of the Attorney General.

The CHP also has a Special Response Team (SRT) for rapidly responding to natural disasters or civil disturbances throughout the state. Specialized training and equipment help to quickly quell unrest, preserve life, prevent property damage, and ensure the safety of the public. 

Additionally, the CHP has dozens of narcotic patrol and explosive detection K-9 teams stationed throughout the state.

The California Highway Patrol&#x27;s additional responsibilities includes a governor protection detail.

Somewhat controversially, the cities of Oakland and Stockton have contracted with the California Highway Patrol to assist their police departments with local patrol duties, including traffic stops and responding to 911 calls.

==Pay and pensions==
Average officer pay was $118,000 in 2014. By law, salaries are set by an average of the five largest police departments in the state. In 2012, the top paid CHP officer received $483,581, 44 other officers earning over $200,000, and over 5,000 officers receiving over $100,000. In 2011, CHP officers earned $82.4 million in overtime, triple the amount in the second largest state, and with one officer earning over $93,000 in overtime alone. Officers are strictly prohibited from working more than 16.5 hours at a time before having to take a minimum 8-hour break.

In 1999, Governor Gray Davis signed SB 400, which allowed CHP officers to retire at age 50 and continue receiving as much as 90% of their peak pay as a pension. This raised the pension earned for 30 years of service from an average of $62,218 to $96,270. Officers&#x27; average retirement age is 54. New officers have a retirement age of 57 in accordance with CalPers 2.7% at 57 formula. As of 2019, a new contract was negotiated with the state, causing officers to increase their contribution to the retirement plan by deferring any percentage over 3% of their annual raise towards their pension. This brings their contribution closer to a 50–50 split with the state, while boosting state contributions toward the officers&#x27; retirements from other sources.

==Organization and accreditation==
The CHP is led by the Commissioner, who is appointed by the Governor of California. The Deputy Commissioner is also appointed by the Governor and the Assistant Commissioners are appointed by the Commissioner.

On February 3, 2023, Acting Commissioner Duryee was appointed to Commissioner by Governor Gavin Newsom.

In 2010 the CHP received initial accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). Upon receiving this honor, the CHP became the largest CALEA-accredited law enforcement agency in the nation.

On November 16, 2013, the CHP Academy was formally recognized as an accredited Public Safety Training Academy by CALEA, becoming the first accredited state police training academy in the nation. Additionally, the department succeeded in its bid for Advanced Law Enforcement reaccreditation, and remains the largest accredited law enforcement agency in the nation.

On November 22, 2014, the CHP communications centers were formally accredited by CALEA under the Public Safety Communications Agencies Accreditation Program. Having received this honor, the CHP became the first accredited state highway patrol in the nation to receive communications accreditation.

Having received accreditation status for its communications centers, the CHP became one of only two agencies in California to receive the CALEA TRI-ARC award, which is given to agencies having concurrent CALEA accreditation for their law enforcement, public safety communications and public safety training Academy. The CHP is one of nearly 20 agencies to have received this award.

==Rank structure==

==Traditions==
CHP uniforms are traditionally khaki-colored with campaign hat and blue-and-gold trouser stripe. Command officers wear a tan combination cap. The dress uniform includes a forest green jacket and royal blue tie (bow tie for motor officers). Cold weather and utility uniforms are dark blue. Leather gear is black basketweave leather with brass snaps and buckles.

Standard traffic enforcement patrol vehicles are required by state law to have a white door with, in the case of the CHP, a star. The CHP operates traditional black and white as well as all-white patrol vehicles.

The California Highway Patrol is one of the few organizations to continue to use the older toll-free &quot;Zenith 1-2000&quot; number. With the falling cost of telephone area code 800 and 888 numbers, most organizations have chosen to switch to one of the newer numbers and discontinue use of the Zenith service, which requires operator assistance. The CHP&#x27;s traditions include its own radio codes, widely adopted by local agencies. The most important is 11‑99, which signifies that an officer needs emergency assistance or that an officer is down.

In 1981, a charitable foundation called the 11‑99 Foundation was founded to provide benefits and scholarships to officers and their families. The members of the foundation&#x27;s board of directors have provided over $16 million in assistance to current, retired, and those fallen in the line of duty CHP employees and their families. The organization&#x27;s name is taken from the radio code.

==Fallen officers==

Since its inception in 1929, 227 officers have died in the line of duty. The top three frequent causes of line of duty deaths to date are (in order of cause): Automobile/Motorcycle Accidents, Gunfire, and Vehicular Assault (i.e., struck by drunk driver, reckless driving, or hearing and/or visually impaired drivers). 1964 was the deadliest year, in which eight officers died in the line of duty; 1970 and 1978 were the second deadliest years, in which seven officers died in the line of duty.

==Mexico Liaison Unit==

The Mexico Liaison Unit is a Border Division Unit based in San Diego. Since the CHP has no jurisdiction directly in Mexico, officers from the Unit work closely with Mexican authorities to recover and find stolen vehicles and assist with other law enforcement issues. The purpose of the &quot;Mexico Liaison Unit&quot; is to develop and maintain positive working relations with Mexican authorities in order to:
* Locate and identify stolen U.S. vehicles taken to Mexico
* Identify vehicle thieves and ensure their prosecution, either in Mexico or California
* Provide assistance to Mexican and U.S. authorities

The unit was originally established in 1958 and only consisted of one officer. It was discontinued in the 1970s, and reestablished in 1980. The unit now consists of one sergeant and six officers, all of whom are fluent in Spanish.

==Newhall Incident==
On April 6, 1970, four California Highway Patrol officers were killed in a 4‑minute shootout in the Newhall region of Southern California. The incident is a landmark in CHP history because of both its emotional impact and the procedural and doctrinal reforms implemented by the CHP in the incident&#x27;s aftermath.

The shootout occurred in a restaurant parking lot just before midnight. Officers Walt Frago and Roger Gore were alerted by radio of a vehicle carrying someone who brandished a weapon. They spotted the car, fell in behind, called for backup, and began the stop procedure. When the suspects&#x27; vehicle came to a halt in the parking lot, the driver was instructed to step out of the vehicle and spread his hands on the hood. Gore approached him and Frago moved to the passenger side. The passenger side door suddenly swung open and the passenger sprung out, firing at Frago, who fell with two shots in his chest. The gunman, later identified as Jack Twinning, then turned and fired once at Gore, who returned fire. In that moment the driver, Bobby Davis, turned and shot Gore twice at close range. Both officers died instantly.

When Officers James Pence and George Alleyn drove in moments later, they could not see suspects or other officers, but both immediately came under fire. Officer Pence put out an 11‑99 call (&quot;officer in distress&quot;) then took cover behind the passenger door. Alleyn grabbed his shotgun, and positioned himself behind the driver-side door. Both officers were mortally wounded in the ensuing exchange, and one suspect was hit.

Suspects Jack Twinning and Bobby Davis escaped, later abandoned their vehicle and then split up. For nine hours, officers blanketed the area searching for the killers. Twinning broke into a house and briefly held a man hostage. Officers used tear gas before storming the house, but Twinning committed suicide with the shotgun he stole from Frago. Davis was captured, stood trial and convicted on four counts of murder. He was sentenced to death, but in 1972, the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty to be cruel and unusual punishment and in 1973, the court commuted his sentence to life in prison.

Of the incident, Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California at the time, said the following: &quot;If anything worthwhile comes of this tragedy, it should be the realization by every citizen that often the only thing that stands between them and losing everything they hold dear ... is the man wearing a badge.&quot;

A follow-up investigation eventually led to a complete revision of procedures during high-risk and felony stops. Firearms procedures have also changed fundamentally due to this incident, and physical methods of arrest have been improved. The police baton and pepper spray have been added to the officer&#x27;s arsenal, with more in‑depth training in their use.

The 25th anniversary of the Newhall Incident was observed on April 6, 1995, at the present Newhall Area office, where a brick memorial pays tribute to Officers George Alleyn (6290), Walt Frago (6520), Roger Gore (6547) and James Pence (6885). The memorial once stood at the former Newhall office, but was rebuilt at the new site, about one mile (1.6 km) from the scene of the slayings.

==History of the former California State Police and its Merger with the California Highway Patrol==
On July 12, 1995, the California State Police, which was a separate agency, was merged into the CHP, thus greatly expanding the agency&#x27;s mandate. In addition to safety on the state highway system, it is now responsible for the safety of all elected state officials and all people who work in or are utilizing a state building in California, such as the State Capitol Building in Sacramento.

It has also been discussed to merge the Law Enforcement Division of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife into the California Highway Patrol. By doing so, this may allow for better protection of California&#x27;s environment and natural resources. The underfunded CDFW Law Enforcement Division has faced low numbers of Game Wardens also known as Wildlife Officers for the last ten years; a similar idea is already in place in Oregon and Alaska, where the Oregon State Police and Alaska State Troopers serve as game wardens under a separate fish and wildlife division within the two departments.

==Firearms==

The California Highway Patrol currently issues the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P pistol chambered in .40S&amp;W, replacing the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 4006 TSW.

==Vehicles==
===Origins===
When motor vehicles in California were first seen as needing legislation, law enforcement agencies began to patrol using motorcycles, cars and trucks. Motorcycle officers in 1920 Fresno, started a group to assist each other and promote road safety – the Joaquin Valley Traffic Officer&#x27;s Association – led by Harry Wilson who they elected as president. They renamed themselves the California Association of Highway Patrolmen in 1921, and became the California Highway Patrol in 1927 under the auspices of the Department of Motor Vehicles.

===Motorcycles===
As of 2023, CHP had transitioned to BMW motorcycles with the BMW R1250RT-P to replace the aging fleet of Harley-Davidsons. 

Through the public competitive bidding process, the Harley-Davidson Electraglide motorcycle was selected as the primary enforcement motorcycle for the California Highway Patrol in 2013.

These replacement enforcement motorcycles will replenish the department&#x27;s aging motorcycle fleet. In a cost-saving move, the CHP previously deferred the purchase of replacement motorcycles and has not purchased enforcement motorcycles since January 14, 2011. As a result, approximately 20 percent of the current fleet has logged 100,000 plus miles – well exceeding the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.

CHP&#x27;s motorcycle program enhances public safety. Motorcycle officers are able to effectively enforce traffic laws in areas in which enforcement by four-wheel vehicles is impractical. Motorcycles can access scenes of accidents and natural disasters more quickly and work commute traffic in way that is unique to the motorcycle. Additionally, motorcycles play a special role in dignitary protection.

The CHP has approximately 415 enforcement motorcycles working the roads throughout California. The CHP purchased 121 of the Harley-Davidson enforcement motorcycles to replace motorcycles that have high mileage or have been damaged in traffic collisions. As of June 2013, approximately 22 percent of the CHP&#x27;s motorcycle fleet is over 100,000 miles with more than half of those over 125,000 miles. On average, a CHP enforcement motorcycle is driven 14,000 miles per year.

Early motorcycles used included Indian, Harley-Davidson and Henderson manufactured bikes during the 1920s and 30s; though by 1941, the main manufacturers used at the training academy were Harley-Davidson and Indian.

In 1998, CHP began using the BMW R1100RT-P, with features including a helmet interface for communications, two batteries, and a top speed of .

===Patrol cars===

The Department of General Services is responsible for selecting a vehicle based on price, performance and payload capacity for the CHP. The bid specifications require a pursuit-rated, rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive that can carry at least 1,500 pounds, the approximate weight of four officers, their equipment, and the police vehicle equipment.

The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor averaged 14 mpg city and 21 mpg highway. The new Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle costs $26,578, which includes a 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty. The department was paying $24,043 for the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and recently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to maintain all vehicles no longer covered by warranty. Several vehicles were allocated to public affairs officers and are used for recruiting purposes. An example of these vehicles can be seen at the California State Fair and other venues. The last Crown Victoria&#x27;s were retired in September 2020. 

CHP also uses the Ford F-250, RAM 2500, and Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (still in testing) for commercial vehicle enforcement.

In July 2016, it was announced that the CHP would be taking delivery of 516 2016 Dodge Charger Pursuits equipped with the 3.6L Pentastar V6 in RWD configuration. These cars were hoped to be more reliable than the Ford Police Interceptor Utility, which have been plagued with various recalls and breakdowns, the most notable breakdowns being transmission and PTU (transfer case) failures.

In 2017, it was announced that the CHP were going to start using Chevrolet Tahoe Police Pursuit Vehicles (PPV) for rural and resident posts, along with areas that see snowfall in the winter months. This is because of their ability to carry a larger &quot;basic load&quot; of normal issue equipment, equipment that may be only in a few cars, and/or not carried in patrol cars at all, in a more urban setting, along with the selectable 4 wheel drive system to allow better performance in the snow.

In 2022, CHP began rolling out an all wheel drive version of the 2020 Charger Pursuit. These, like their predecessor, are powered by the naturally aspirated 3.6L Pentastar V6 Pentastar engine, making 292bhp and 260lb/ft of torque. In 2025, CHP Fleet Operations rolled a limited number of 2020 Charger Pursuit in 5.7L Hemi V8 in a rear-wheel drive configuration, making 370bhp and 395lb/ft of torque, outfitted with license plate readers (LPRs), to deplete the remaining stock of Chargers. 

As of 2023 the California Highway Patrol has officially rolled out its 299 2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility after a 3-year hold due to an issue involving the RF interference from the headlights to the department&#x27;s VHF-Lowband radios. These vehicles are powered by the naturally aspirated flex fuel 3.3 liter V6, making 285bhp and 260lb/ft of torque. 

During 2023, the average mileage of its in-service primary patrol vehicles ranged anywhere from 150,000 miles to nearly 400,000 miles, proving the 2013-2019 Year Interceptor Utilities nearly or just as capable as the previous Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors. 

It was also reported in 2023 that the CHP is testing the latest generation Dodge Durango special service package, and has selected the 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe PPV to be upfitted and utilized after completing the latest batch of Dodge Chargers.

As it stands, the highest mileage vehicle that was used by the California Highway Patrol was a 2013 Ford PIU, with an odometer at 384,857 miles upon retirement, which had patrolled the California/Nevada Border in Needles.

==== Aircraft ====
The CHP utilizes both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. As of October 2020, the fleet consisted of:

*15 Airbus Helicopters (Eurocopter) AS350B3 Squirrels
*8 Cessna T206H Turbo Stationairs
*7 Gippsaero GA8 TC-320 Airvans
*1 Raytheon (Beechcraft) B300 Super King Air
*1 Cessna 208B Grand Caraven EX

==Notable incidents==
===George Gwaltney===
George Gwaltney, a former officer from Barstow, was convicted on May 10, 1984, in federal court for the on‑duty rape and murder of 23-year-old Robin Bishop on January 11, 1982. He had reported finding a dead body off a deserted stretch of interstate 15 the same day he murdered her with his service weapon. Gwaltney was tried twice for this murder at the San Bernardino County Court House. The first trial ended with the jury deadlocked 8–4 and the second 7–5. The district attorney attempted to try Gwaltney a third time, but a Superior court judge dismissed the murder charge. Since Gwaltney was allowed to go free for the first two state trials, the FBI took over the case. The FBI was able to piece together the events leading up to the murder and the on-duty rape of Robin Bishop and interrogating Gwaltney&#x27;s alibi, Preston Olson and his mother. There was more forensic evidence that the FBI succeeded in getting to build their case against Gwaltney; soon his story started to fall apart. After the six-month investigation by the FBI, George Michael Gwaltney was arrested in Barstow and tried at the US District Court in Los Angeles. He was represented by a public defender who chose not to have Gwaltney testify as he had done in the previous two state trials. He was found guilty of the murder, rape and the deprivation of Robin Bishop&#x27;s civil rights while on duty. He was the first California Highway Patrol officer to be charged with the indictment of violating the civil rights of Robin Bishop as well as being the first CHP officer known to commit a murder while on duty. Following the conviction, Gwaltney was subsequently sentenced to 90 years in prison, being eligible for parole after serving at least 30 years. Gwaltney died in federal custody from a heart attack in 1997.

===Craig Peyer===
Craig Peyer, a former officer from Poway, is serving a forty-year prison sentence for the on-duty strangulation and murder of 20-year-old Cara Knott on December 27, 1986. After she was killed, Knott&#x27;s body was discarded over an abandoned highway bridge. Peyer was convicted of first-degree murder in 1988. Though he has maintained innocence ever since, Peyer has been denied parole consistently. In 2004, the parole board offered Peyer the chance to prove his alleged innocence by providing a DNA sample to compare against a drop of blood found on Cara&#x27;s shoe, using modern DNA profiling. Peyer declined to provide a sample, nor explain why he declined to do so.

===Pictures===

In 2006, two officers forwarded photos taken of Nikki Catsouras, a teenager who died in a motor vehicle accident, to colleagues without authorization. These photos quickly spread on the internet. The family sued and reached a settlement in the case with CHP for $2.37 million in 2012.

The CHP hosts or partners with numerous programs for public safety education and community involvement. 

Its youth programs include:
* Every 15 Minutes – a two-day anti-drunk driving presentation for high school students
* Impact Teen Drivers – a nonprofit against teen distracted driving that is partnered with the CHP
* Red Ribbon Week – a week in October dedicated to education about the dangers of illicit drugs for students of all ages

==Origins of the name==
When the CHP was formed, there were discussions as to what to call this new agency. The consensus was for the name &quot;California Highway Patrol&quot;. The American Automobile Association (AAA) is a private organization which provided, among other things, roadside assistance to their members. At that time, the AAA had a fleet of trucks which patrolled the roads so they could assist their members. These trucks carried a sign which said &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;. The CHP organizers decided it would be best to contact the AAA to see if they would object to the state using this name. The AAA considered the idea, and gave their consent.

==In popular culture==
The CHP gained international recognition in the late 1970s to the early 1980s through the broadcast of the TV series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, which chronicled the adventures of two fictional CHP motorcycle officers.

CHP personnel acted as technical advisors to the 1950s TV show Highway Patrol.

<text>Ronald Paul Bucca (May 6, 1954 – September 11, 2001) was a New York City Fire Department Marshal killed during the September 11 attacks during the collapse of the World Trade Center. He was the only fire marshal in the history of the New York City Fire Department to be killed in the line of duty.

==Military career==
Bucca had served in the United States Army as a Green Beret during the Vietnam War. Later, he would serve the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as an analyst. Becoming a warrant officer in the Army Reserve in 1986, he was subsequently injured on his civilian job as an FDNY firefighter, which cost him his qualifications as a paratrooper and ended his eligibility with the Army Special Forces, causing him to leave the service. 

==Firefighting career==

Bucca was a 22-year veteran of the department; he was promoted to Fire Marshal in 1992. As such, he was one of the people who investigated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the FDNY representative on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. By 2000, the fire department&#x27;s seat was removed, and Bucca&#x27;s position there relinquished.

After responding to the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bucca ascended to the impact zone at the Sky Lobby on the 78th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, along with Battalion Chief Orio Palmer. The two men, both experienced marathon runners, are believed to have made it to the highest floor of any first responders in either tower before the building collapsed. His body was found on October 23, 2001 and identified using his badge. Bucca was the only fire marshal in the history of the New York City Fire Department to be killed in the line of duty.

==Legacy==
In 2003, military police named the principal detainee holding camp in Iraq &quot;Camp Bucca&quot;.

At the National 9/11 Memorial, Bucca is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-14, along with those of other first responders killed in the attacks.

DIA honors Bucca each year through an annual award named after him. The award is given to a military reservist who demonstrates excellence in fulfilling the counterterrorism mission, the area that Bucca worked while at DIA.

Bucca&#x27;s son, Ron Bucca Jr. joined the Green Berets at age 23, motivated to pursue terrorists like those responsible for the death of his father. He rose to the rank of Master Sergeant, and by 2021, had been through five combat tours.

<text>Michael Bartley Peters (born October 9, 1943), better known as Mike Peters, is an American Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist and the creator of the comic strip &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where his mother, Charlotte Peters, was a local television personality with one of the earliest TV talk shows, interviewing film stars and politicians as early as 1949. Accompanying his mother to the studio, he would meet such celebrities as Bob Hope and Martin and Lewis. The show influenced Peters&#x27; own life:
:My mom did more than a talk show. If you go to YouTube and put in Charlotte Peters, you can see an hour of her show. She sang, she danced, she entertained 250 audience members every day. It was a variety show, but also a talk show... My sister and I were like celebrities in town because of our mom. And during freshman year of high school, I would have girls who I didn’t even know call me and ask me to come with them to their junior or senior prom. If you’re a freshman or a sophomore, you never go to the prom, but these girls who were juniors and seniors would invite me to their prom. And of course, I would say yes. And I would go and rent a tuxedo, and I would go to their house and meet the mother and father of these girls. Then they would take me in their car, and while they were driving us to the prom, the mother would say, “Mike, did you know that Gloria plays the violin?” And I would say, “Really?” and she would say, “Yes, would you like to hear her play some time?” And I’d say, “Sure,” and she would pull a violin out from under the seat of the car and hand it to Gloria and Gloria would then proceed to play the violin for me all the way to the prom. And it happened again with a girl who played oboe. The mother pulled out the oboe and that girl, too, would play music for me all the way to the prom. And I was getting used to it. I would just sit there and enjoy the music... Not until I was 30-years-old did I realize that they were auditioning for my mom’s show. And I thought any girl, while being driven to the prom, would play music for you. And so, when I invited the first girl to come to the prom with me, and she didn’t play a musical instrument, I thought I was being dissed. I thought, &quot;What is this? Aren’t you supposed to be playing music for me?&quot; 
Growing up in St. Louis, Peters attended Christian Brothers College High School and Washington University, where he studied fine art, became a Sigma Chi member and graduated in 1965. He drew cartoons for the college paper, &quot;Student Life&quot;, from 1962 to 1965. Peters recalled, &quot;I knew when I was five years old that I wanted to be a cartoonist. As I grew older, I thought it was the only thing I could do.&quot;

He met his wife, Marian, while attending Washington University, and they moved to Chicago, where he worked for a year on the art staff of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. Drafted into the army, he spent two years of service as an artist for the Seventh Psychological Operations Group in Okinawa.

==Career==
===Editorial cartoons===
On his return from his army service, his mentor Bill Mauldin helped him get a job as editorial cartoonist for the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; in Dayton, Ohio. As a joke, he once stood on the building ledge outside the &quot;Daily News&quot; building for 30 minutes wearing a Superman costume so that he could make an entrance to a meeting through the window in the manner of actor George Reeves entering Perry White&#x27;s office on &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;.

When his animated editorial cartoons &quot;Peters Postscripts&quot; began on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in 1981, it was the first time animated editorial cartoons appeared regularly on a prime-time network news program. Peters also hosted the 14-part interview series &quot;The World of Cartooning with Mike Peters&quot; for PBS. In 1998, Peters created a show segment for Fox Kids called Night of the Living Fred, it appeared on Fox Kids’s Horror-comedy show,  Toonsylvania.

In regard to politics, Peters&#x27;s editorial stances are generally left of center.

===Comic strip===
In 1984, he launched &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;, distributed by King Features Syndicate. The strip is published in 500 newspapers, and according to King Features, it has a daily readership of 100 million. Peters&#x27; editorial cartoons and his comic strip are both distributed through King Features&#x27; DailyINK email service.

==Personal life==
Mike and Marian Peters have three daughters and six grandchildren.

==Exhibitions==
Beginning February 24, 2012, his strips and editorial cartoons were exhibited by the Key West Art and Historical Society at the Custom House in Key West, Florida. “This exhibit is a self-portrait of the artist,” said Claudia Pennington, the Society&#x27;s executive director. “It looks into the genius of Mike Peters through his early work to the present day.”

==Awards==
In 1981, Peters won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning. He has received recognition for &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot; with the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s 1991 Reuben Award and a nomination for their Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 2000.

He has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

<doc id="432569" wikidata="Q2741548" url="?curid=432569" title="Marquess of Lothian">
<text>Marquess of Lothian is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, which was created in 1701 for Robert Kerr, 4th Earl of Lothian. The Marquess of Lothian holds the subsidiary peerages of Earl of Lothian (created 1606 and 1631), Earl of Ancram (created 1633 and 1701), Viscount of Briene (1701), Lord Newbattle (1591), Lord Jedburgh (1622), Lord Kerr of Newbattle (1631), Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewtoun, and Dolphinstoun (1633), Lord Kerr of Newbattle, Oxnam, Jedburgh, Dolphinstoun and Nisbet (1701), and Baron Ker, of Kersheugh in the County of Roxburgh (1821), all but the last in the Peerage of Scotland. As The Lord Ker in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, previous marquesses sat in the House of Lords before 1963, when Scottish peers first sat in the House of Lords in their own right. The holder of the marquessate is also the Chief of Clan Kerr.

The 13th Marquess of Lothian was better known as the Conservative politician Michael Ancram. In November 2010, he received a life peerage as Baron Kerr of Monteviot and so became entitled to sit in the House of Lords. He lived at Monteviot House in Roxburghshire. The family previously owned a larger Scottish seat, Newbattle Abbey in Midlothian, which is now a college, and also Blickling Hall in Norfolk, which now belongs to the National Trust.

The 14th and current Marquess is Ralph Kerr, brother of the 13th Marquess. He owns Ferniehirst Castle in Roxburghshire, which is the family seat that was restored by the 12th Marquess, and Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire. The heir apparent is his eldest son John.

==History of the titles==
Clan Kerr has several branches. The name &quot;Kerr,&quot; from the Old Norse &quot;kjrr&quot; meaning &quot;marsh-dweller,&quot; arrived in Scotland from Normandy. In Scotland it was rendered Kerr, Ker, Carr and Carre, with a Scottish variant on the west coast taken from the Gaelic &quot;ciar,&quot; meaning dusky. According to the lore of the family of Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian, the name comes from the Norman chiefs Ralph and Robert, brothers who came to Roxburgh from Lancashire in the 1300s.

The Kerrs of Ferniehurst claim descent from Ralph, while the Kerrs of Cessford claim they are descended from Robert. These two main branches of Clan Kerr were often at odds with one another, fighting until they came together in the early 1500s. The Kerrs subsequently also warred with the Scott Clan, until the feud ended when Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehurst married Janet Scott. In a 1591 charter of King James V, Mark Kerr had his lands at Newbattle and Prestongrange erected into the barony of Newbattle.

===1st title===
Mark Kerr was created Lord Newbattle in 1591 and Earl of Lothian in 1606, both with remainder to his heirs male. The title went to the eldest of his four sons, Robert Kerr, 2nd Earl of Lothian. In 1621 both titles were surrendered by the 2nd Earl and regranted with a special remainder to his daughters, the eldest of whom, Lady Anne Kerr, succeeded to both titles on his death in 1624. Her husband, Sir William Kerr (eldest son of Sir Robert Kerr, later 1st Earl of Ancram) was created Lord Kerr of Newbattle and Earl of Lothian in 1631. On her death in 1667 their eldest son became 4th Earl of Lothian (though he was not recognised as such) and on her husband&#x27;s death in 1675 also 2nd Earl of Lothian.

===2nd title as Marquess===
By this point Sir Robert Kerr, father of the 1st Earl of the 2nd creation, had been created Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewtoun and Dolphinstoun and Earl of Ancram, and the titles had been inherited by the 4th and 2nd Earl of Lothian&#x27;s uncle, Charles Kerr, on whose death in 1690 he became 3rd Earl of Ancram.

He was then created Lord Ker of Newbattle, Oxnam, Jedburgh, Dolphinstoun and Nisbet, Viscount of Briene, Earl of Ancram and Marquess of Lothian in 1701.

The 2nd Marquess succeeded his cousin as Lord Jedburgh before succeeding to the Marquessate, and the 6th Marquess was created Baron Ker, of Kersheugh in the County of Roxburgh, in 1821, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Earls of Lothian; First creation (1606)==
*Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian (1553–1609)
*Robert Kerr, 2nd Earl of Lothian (died 1624)

<text>Zhenjiang, alternately romanized as Chinkiang, is a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu Province, China. It lies on the southern bank of the Yangtze River near its intersection with the Grand Canal. It is opposite Yangzhou (to its north) and between Nanjing (to its west) and Changzhou (to its east). Zhenjiang was formerly the provincial capital of Jiangsu and remains as an important transportation hub. As of the 2020 census, its total population was 3,210,418 inhabitants whom 1,266,790 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 3 urban districts. The town is best known both in China and abroad for Chinkiang vinegar, a fragrant black vinegar that is a staple of Chinese cooking.

==Names==
Prior to the adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the city&#x27;s name was typically romanized as or 

Former names include Jingkou and Runzhou.

==History==

A part of Zhenjiang was held by Ce, Marquess of Yi, under the early Zhou dynasty. It was subsequently known as Zhufang and Guyang. After the unification of China by Shi Huangdi of Qin in 221BC, the area was organized as the county (xian) of Dantu. One Chinese legend relates that the site&#x27;s fengshui was so advantageous that the First Emperor ordered 3000 prisoners to dig a tunnel through one of its hills to dissipate its qi. In the middle of the 3rd centuryBC, Dantu was elevated to the status of a commandery (jun).

The Sui took the city in AD581 from Chen and made it an important garrison on the lower Yangtze, the source of its present name (&quot;Protecting the River&quot;). In 595, it was restored to commandery status. Its importance grew with the construction of the Grand Canal, after which it served as the chief collection and transit center for the grain tax paid by the farmers of the Yangtze delta. The city flourished from the 10th to 13th centuries, when it produced fine silks, satins, and silverware for the Song emperors. The 11th-century scientist and statesman Shen Kuo composed his 1088 &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; during his retirement in a garden estate on the outskirts of the city. It was taken by the Mongolians during their 1275 campaign against the Southern Song capital at Hangzhou. Under their Yuan dynasty, some Nestorian Christians were reported living in the city. The city fell to Xu Da on 17 March 1356. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Zhenjiang had a vast amount of shipping, more so than any other city in the world. The ships which worked the city were painted white and often doubled as businesses such as taverns or other gathering spots. Under the Ming, it was the seat of a prefecture (fu) of Nanzhili, the Southern Directly-Administered District around the secondary capital Nanjing. The Southern Ming placed the town under Zheng Zhifeng, brother of Zheng Zhilong and favorite uncle of Koxinga. He was fooled into wasting most of his ammunition against a feint, however, and forced to abandon the city to the Manchus on 1 June 1645.
Under the Qing, Zhenjiang was a city of half a million surrounded by a series of brick city walls up to high. It continued as a prefectural seat, first under the &quot;Right&quot; Governor of Jiangnan at Suzhou and later under the governor of Jiangsu in Jiangning (now Nanjing). After a fierce resistance, Zhenjiangromanized at the time as Chinkiangwas captured by the British on 21 July 1842 during the First Opium War. As this left the path open to Nanjing, its fall prompted the unequal Treaty of Nanking to avoid further conflict. A decade later, massive floods of the Yellow River altered its course from south to north of Shandong and closed the northern path of the Grand Canal. Soon after, Zhenjiang was sacked by the Taiping rebels in 1853. It was recaptured by the Qing in 1858 and opened as a treaty port in 1861. Into the 1870s, Chaozhou merchants used their connections in Zhenjiang to make it a regional distribution center for opium purchased from the foreign merchants in Shanghai; when David Sassoon attempted to avoid taxation by delivering his cargoes directly to the opium merchants in Zhenjiang, the Chinese organized to intimidate his customers and then bought out his failed organization. The population was estimated at 168,000 in 1904.
The southern part of the Grand Canal was obstructed in the early 20th century, although by that point the city was connected by rail to Shanghai and Nanjing. The Kuomintang government revoked the British concession at Zhenjiang in 1929.

From 1928 to 1949, while Nanjing served as the capital of the Republic of China, Zhenjiang served as the provincial capital for Jiangsu. During World War II, the city fell to Japan&#x27;s Shanghai Expeditionary Army in the morning of 8 December 1937, shortly before the capture of Nanjing, but local resistance to the Japanese is still celebrated among the Chinese. When the Communists won the Chinese Civil War and relocated the capital to Beijing, Nanjing resumed its role as Jiangsu&#x27;s capital.

Zhenjiang is still one of China&#x27;s busiest ports for domestic commerce, serving as a hub for trade among Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai. The trade mostly consists of grain, cotton, oils, and lumber. The other main industries are mostly in the field of food processing and paper pulp manufacturing.

==Geography==
===Climate===

The city has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen:Cwa), with a noticeable rise in rainfall during the East Asian monsoon. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from (unofficial record of was set on 27 January 1933) to .

==Administration==
The prefecture-level city of Zhenjiang administers 6 county-level divisions, including three districts and three county-level cities.

These are further divided into 77 township-level divisions, including 66 towns, 1 township and 10 subdistricts.

==Demographics==
As in Nanjing, Zhenjiang&#x27;s old Wu dialects have been entirely supplanted by a dialect of Lower Yangtze Mandarin. It is incomprehensible to the residents of neighboring Changzhou, whose dialect remains a form of Taihu Wu.

The population was 3,210,418 as of 2020, reflecting a 0.31% annual change from the 2010 census, which recorded a population of 3,114,105.

==Culture==
Zhenjiang is most famous for its fragrant black vinegar, called Zhenjiang vinegar. Chinese legend traces it to Heita, the son of Dukang, the supposed inventor of alcoholic beverages. Having forgotten about a vat of wine for 21 days, he found it had spoiled but now possessed a pleasant sour taste that could be used to complement foods. The present recipe is said to date back 1400 years, with its major modern manufacturer—the Jiangsu Hengshun Vinegar Industry Co.—dating to 1840.

Other local specialties include crab cream bun, Chinkiang pork (, akin to head cheese), and pickled vegetables. Formerly, households in Zhenjiang would prepare for the new year by eating a red-bean dish and avoiding rice. One bowl of beans was left on the table to feed the home&#x27;s flies, from the belief that they would then avoid disturbing the family during the new year festivities.

A natural spring in a park on the edge of Zhenjiang has been famed since the Tang (7th–9th century) as the best in Jiangsu for making tea. It is now marketed as the &quot;First Spring under Heaven&quot;.

The 15th-century Japanese ink-wash master Sesshū Tōyō studied in Zhenjiang.

The local Jinshan temple appears in the tale of &quot;Madame White Snake&quot; and inspired a replica in the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s garden at Chengde.

==Transport==

Zhenjiang is located in the convenient Yangtze River Delta transport corridor, at the crossroads of the Grand Canal and the Yangtze, and between the Shanghai and Nanjing economic regions. The Port of Zhenjiang is the third largest port on the Yangtze. The city has two Yangtze River crossings. The Runyang Yangtze River Bridge complex, which has one of the longest suspension bridge spans in the world, connects to Yangzhou. The Taizhou Yangtze River Bridge, one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world, connects Yongzhong with Taizhou.

===Rail===
Zhenjiang has been connected by rail since 1906, at the completion of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. The railway was extended to Beijing after the completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in 1968, connecting Zhenjiang to China&#x27;s political and commercial hubs. The primary railway station was Zhenjiang West Railway Station, which was demolished in 2004 due to congestion it caused in the city center. Since then Zhenjiang Railway Station has served as the city&#x27;s principal railway station.

==== High-speed rail ====

Since April 2010, Zhenjiang has been on the route of the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Rail, the first high-speed rail with a design speed of over to serve the city. In 2011, the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway was completed. Trains on the line stop at Zhenjiang South Railway Station. The two high-speed lines have reduced travel time between Zhenjiang and Shanghai to under an hour, and travel time to Beijing to under five hours. Rail service to Shanghai is frequent - averaging one train in less than half an hour.

===Air===
Zhenjiang does not have a commercial airport within its city limits, although there is a military airfield, Zhenjiang Dalu Airport (), which may open to regional flights in the future. Zhenjiang city center is away from Changzhou Benniu International Airport, about a one-hour drive () away from Nanjing Lukou International Airport via Nanjing Provincial Highway 243, and approximately a two-hour () drive away from Sunan Shuofang International Airport. Check-in facilities are available for Lukou Airport in the New Zhenjiang Bus Station ().

===Roadways===
Zhenjiang is on the route of Beijing-Shanghai Expressway, and China National Highway 312.

===Public transport===
, Zhenjiang had an extensive number of bus routes - numbering nearly one hundred. Since 2012 the city&#x27;s entire fleet of city buses are equipped with GPS and are managed centrally through a &quot;smart transport network system.&quot;

==Industry==
Zhenjiang Export Processing Zone was approved by the State Council on March 10, 2003, with a total planned area of . The first-phrase project completed in December 2003 covers and was certified by the Customs General Administration and other seven ministries for operation on December 24, 2003. Zhenjiang Export Processing Zone is located close to Changzhou Airport and Zhenjiang Port.

==Education==
Public institutions having full-time Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs include Jiangsu University () and the Jiangsu University of Science and Technology (). Zhenjiang is home to the Silkworm Raising Research Institute of the Academy of Agricultural Science of China. The Shaozong Library includes a 100-volume collection of sayings and proverbs dating from the 7th to 11th centuries.

Senior high schools are Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang No. 1 High School (), the Zhenjiang High School of Jiangsu Province () and the Jiangsu Provincial Dagang High School ().

<text>Ludivine Sagnier (born 3 July 1979) is a French actress. She has been nominated three times for the César Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; (2003), &quot;8 Women&quot; (2003), and &quot;A Secret&quot; (2007).

==Career==
Sagnier was born in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, in the &quot;département&quot; of Yvelines, France. Her mother is a retired secretary and her father is a professor of English at the University of Paris.

She made her film debut at the age of nine in &quot;Les Maris, les Femmes, les Amants&quot;, (1989) directed by Pascal Thomas. She had other small roles in the early 1990s, being directed by Alain Resnais and in Jean-Paul Rappeneau&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; with Gerard Depardieu.

In 1994 she went to study at the Versailles Conservatoire, where she won a prize in classical music. Her return to cinema saw her gain commercial and critical success, notably in films directed by François Ozon. His musical comedy &quot;8 Women&quot; (2002) was awarded acting prizes for Sagnier and her seven co-stars collectively.

The next year she starred alongside Charlotte Rampling in Ozon&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Swimming Pool&quot;, a role which again garnered her nominations and prizes. Other notable films she has appeared in include &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, as Tinkerbell, and the crime thriller &quot;Mesrine: Public Enemy No.1&quot;.

Three films starring Sagnier screened in Los Angeles in 2011 where Sagnier was in attendance at all three screenings. &quot;Pieds nus sur les limaces&quot; (Lily Sometimes) was shown at the City of Angels, City of Light Festival in April. &quot;Love Crime&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Double&quot; were shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June. Also that year, Sagnier appeared in &quot;Beloved&quot; with Catherine Deneuve and Chiara Mastroianni.

Sagnier starred as Esther Aubry in the 2016 English-language drama series &quot;The Young Pope&quot;. She reprised the role in the follow-up miniseries &quot;The New Pope&quot;, released in 2020. Sagnier plays Claire in the French thriller series &quot;Lupin&quot;, which premiered on Netflix in January 2021.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Sagnier gave birth to a daughter, with her then boyfriend, actor Nicolas Duvauchelle.

<doc id="432589" wikidata="Q5014639" url="?curid=432589" title="CTV Northern Ontario">
<text>CTV Northern Ontario, formerly known as [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]], is a system of four television stations in Northern Ontario, Canada, owned and operated by the CTV Television Network, a division of Bell Media.

These stations are:
* [[CICI-TV]] - Greater Sudbury (flagship station)
* [[CKNY-DT]] - North Bay
* [[CHBX-TV]] - Sault Ste. Marie
* [[CITO-TV]] - Timmins

Since 2005, all four stations refer to themselves on-air as simply CTV instead of their call letters; however, they remain legally licensed as separate stations, and continue to have common local programming. Station information and history is discussed on each station&#x27;s own page.

==History==
===Background===
Each of the four cities served by the CTV Northern Ontario system saw the launch of a locally owned television station in the 1950s: Sudbury&#x27;s CKSO-TV was launched by the owners of the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; in 1953, Sault Ste. Marie&#x27;s CJIC-TV was launched by Hyland Broadcasting in 1955, North Bay&#x27;s CKGN-TV was launched by Gerry Alger and Gerry Stanton in 1955, and Timmins&#x27;s CFCL-TV was launched by J. Conrad Lavigne in 1956. All four stations were CBC Television affiliates at the time, as CTV did not exist until 1961.

Each station continued to operate separately until 1970 when applications were filed with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to launch a second television station in Sudbury; the application process ultimately resulted in a major realignment in Sudbury, North Bay and Timmins. Cambrian Broadcasting, the Sudbury station&#x27;s owners at this time, acquired the North Bay station and launched a repeater of CKSO in Timmins, serving as the new CTV affiliate in all three cities, while Lavigne launched new stations CKNC-TV in Sudbury and CHNB-TV in North Bay, and retained the CBC affiliation. Although Hyland Broadcasting was one of the original applicants for a new Sudbury station, CJIC remained unaffected by the final outcome at the time.

Through the 1970s, however, the North Bay and Timmins markets proved too small to support competition between multiple stations; although the Sudbury stations were nominally profitable on their own, the losses in North Bay and Timmins left both companies nearly bankrupt by 1980.

===MCTV===
As a result of the stations&#x27; precarious financial situation, the CRTC permitted Northern Cable, the region&#x27;s primary cable television provider, to purchase both companies. Northern Cable formed Mid-Canada Communications as a holding company for the six stations, operating them under a twinstick model. The CRTC explicitly stated that it intended this to be only a temporary arrangement, to end as soon as the CBC could afford to directly acquire MCTV&#x27;s CBC affiliates. At this time, CKSO-TV adopted the new callsign CICI, and its repeater in Timmins became a new standalone station, CITO-TV.

All six stations were referred to on air as Mid-Canada Television, or MCTV for short; the station pairs were distinguished from each other by use of their network affiliation (i.e., &quot;MCTV-CTV&quot; and &quot;MCTV-CBC&quot;). As well, MCTV owned CHRO in Pembroke, a market with no other television stations. CHRO used the same logo and programming schedule as MCTV&#x27;s other stations, but it always used its own callsign, rather than MCTV, as its on-air identification.

Due to CTV&#x27;s status at the time as a cooperative of its affiliated stations, MCTV itself held a 2.1 per cent share in the network.

===Hyland/Huron Broadcasting===
Through the 1970s and 1980s, the Sault Ste. Marie stations remained a separate operation and were not part of Mid-Canada Communications. In 1976, Hyland Broadcasting merged with another local company to form Huron Broadcasting, and in 1978 the company launched CKCY-TV as the city&#x27;s CTV affiliate under the same twinstick model.

Huron Broadcasting did, however, sell most of its radio stations in Sault Ste. Marie and other Northern Ontario communities to Mid-Canada Communications in 1988.

===Baton Broadcasting===

Baton Broadcasting acquired both Mid-Canada and Huron in 1990, and the Huron stations were converted to the MCTV branding at this time. As well, Baton reaffiliated CHRO with CTV. Baton eventually became the sole corporate proprietor of CTV, making the MCTV stations fully owned and operated stations of the network, and sold CHRO to CHUM Limited in 1998; at the time CHUM acquired CHRO, it disaffiliated from CTV and became an independent station for a short time before joining the NewNet system (now CTV 2).

Baton retained the CBC twinsticks until 2002, when it sold them to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Politicians in the area, most notably Sault Ste. Marie MP Carmen Provenzano, expressed the hope that the sale would result in the CBC launching new local newscasts, but when the deal was finalized in early 2003, the CBC simply converted them to full retransmitters of CBLT, Toronto&#x27;s CBC owned-and-operated station, with all four stations surrendering their old call letters. Later in 2003, MCTV&#x27;s master control operations were transferred to the CTV facilities in Toronto.

==News operations==
In November 2001, CTV merged the news production facilities of the MCTV stations into a single regional newscast, with only short inserts for each city&#x27;s local coverage. The regional newscast is produced at CICI. This created extensive controversy, with many public interest groups across Canada raising concerns about the disappearance of local news coverage in small markets. Some groups lobbied for the CBC to produce new local newscasts in the cities on MCTV&#x27;s CBC stations in cooperation with CTV, but this model was not pursued.

Organizations in Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay and Timmins began to call for a boycott of MCTV news, and local companies began offering web-based sources of local news, weather, and sports information, most notably the Village Media network of internet properties. A local video news website called LTVnews.com was launched in Sault Ste. Marie by former CHBX news director Craig Huckerby in 2003; it launched a daily news program on the city&#x27;s cable community channel in 2005, before being acquired by Village Media.

In late 2003 and early 2004, following some resident complaints that MCTV&#x27;s coverage of the city&#x27;s municipal election had been inadequate, Sault Ste. Marie City Council debated a motion requesting that the CRTC direct MCTV to sell a station in the city to a local buyer who would relaunch a fully local newscast, although the motion was criticized in part because it rested on the mistaken belief that MCTV still had ownership and control of the CBC stations.

In October 2005, MCTV News was renamed as &quot;CTV News&quot;, in line with all other CTV owned-and-operated stations. &quot;CTV News&quot; uses WSI&#x27;s TrueView Max Weather Technology to broadcast weather reports during its newscasts.

<doc id="432593" wikidata="Q4803158" url="?curid=432593" title="Asa Mercer">
<text>Asa Shinn Mercer (June 6, 1839 – August 10, 1917) was the first president of the Territorial University of Washington and a member of the Washington State Senate.

He is remembered primarily for his role in three milestones of the old American West: the founding of the University of Washington, the Mercer Girls, and the Johnson County War. Mercer Island in Lake Washington and Mercer Street in Seattle are named not for Asa, but rather his brother Thomas.

Seattle Public Schools operates Asa Mercer International Middle School in Seattle&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood.

== Early life==
Mercer was born in Princeton, Illinois. He had twelve older siblings. According to Mercer, he spent time with Abraham Lincoln in his childhood and claimed that Lincoln encouraged him to travel. Mercer&#x27;s first trip west was in 1852 at age thirteen. In 1860, he attended Franklin College in New Athens, Ohio, returning to Washington on his graduation.

==The University of Washington==
In 1861, as a member of one of the founding families of Seattle, Washington, a young Asa Mercer assisted his brothers in clearing stumps to make way for the new territorial university.

Besides helping with the foundations of the university, Mercer, being the only college graduate in town, was hired by Daniel Bagley as the university&#x27;s sole instructor and president. However, Mercer did not receive a salary.

==The Mercer Girls==

The young town of Seattle was attracting hordes of men to work in the timber and fishing industries, but few marriageable women were willing to make the trip to the remote northwest corner of the United States. In March 1864, with public support and private funding, Mercer traveled to the eastern United States in search of single women to work in Seattle as teachers. On May 16, 1864, he returned to Seattle with eleven women who all found employment as teachers in Seattle. Of these, eight eventually married and settled in the area. This and a subsequent trip introduced dozens of women to the Pacific Northwest, most of whom eventually married local men. The descendants of the Mercer Girls still represent a significant portion of Seattle&#x27;s citizenry. The Mercer Girls story formed the basis of the television show &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;. Mercer himself married one of the Mercer Girls.

== Astoria, Oregon ==

Soon after his marriage, Mercer moved to Oregon where he worked for the federal government in Astoria as a special deputy collector for the customs service. His employment ended in 1867 when he was suspected of being involved in alcohol smuggling, although charges against him were dismissed when key witnesses went missing.

During their time in Oregon, the Mercers purchased three hundred lots in Astoria. Although the real estate endeavor was not lucrative for Mercer, his descendants sold the Astoria properties in 1970 for a substantial sum.

==The Johnson County War==

Mercer became well known throughout the West as a publisher and eventually found his way to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he published the &quot;Northwestern Livestock Journal&quot;, a public relations vehicle for the moneyed cattle interests. As Mercer came to see the clearly underhanded treatment of individual ranchers by the cartels, he began to write more scathing accounts of the events that were unfolding on the open range. His account is told in his book &quot;The Banditti of the Plains&quot; (1894), which was suppressed in its day and is still difficult to find in public libraries in some parts of the Western U.S.

Following the events of the Johnson County War, which included destruction of his newspaper office by arson, Mercer settled into the quiet life of a rancher in Hyattville, Wyoming.

== Personal life ==
Mercer married Annie Elizabeth Stephens, a 26-year-old Irish-Catholic from Baltimore, on July 15, 1866. They had two daughters and six sons; three of their children died in infancy and another as a teenager. Annie Mercer died on October 16, 1900. Asa Mercer died on August 10, 1917, from dysentery.

<doc id="432598" wikidata="Q775595" url="?curid=432598" title="Gulf Islands National Park Reserve">
<text>Gulf Islands National Park Reserve is a national park located on and around the Gulf Islands in British Columbia, Canada. In the National Parks System Plan, this park provides representation of the Strait of Georgia Lowlands natural region, the only place in Canada with a Mediterranean climate of dry, sunny summers and mild, wet winters, the result of a rain shadow effect from surrounding mountains between the region and the ocean. It has similar dominant vegetation as the Pacific Northwest, such as coastal Douglas-fir, western red cedar, shore pine, Pacific dogwood, bigleaf maple, and red alder, but also contains the northern extent of some of the more drought tolerant trees such as Garry oak and Arbutus. The park was created in 2003 as the fortieth national park. It covers of area on 16 islands and more than 30 islets, reefs and surrounding waters, making it the sixth smallest national park in Canada.

==History==
A high proportion of land on the Gulf Islands, over 75%, has been converted to private properties. As settlement and development was impacting character, ecosystems and recreational values, several means of conservation had been initiated. While the province was promoting tourism to the Gulf Islands and establishing provincial parks, such as, among others, D&#x27;Arcy Island Marine Park and Princess Margaret Marine Park on D&#x27;Arcy Island and Portland Island, respectively, they also established the Islands Trust whose mandate for the Gulf Islands is &quot;to preserve and protect the trust area and its unique amenities and environment&quot;. On the federal level, the local member of parliament David Anderson advocated for an organized conservation effort and Minister of Fisheries Jack Davis commissioned, in 1971, a feasibility study of establishing a marine park. A year before, Parks Canada had released its National Parks System Plan which identified 39 natural regions which should be represented in the park system. The unrepresented Strait of Georgia Lowlands natural region, the smallest and most urbanized natural region in the country, includes the Fraser Lowland and the valleys and islands along the Strait of Georgia, like the Gulf Islands. In 1973 Parks Canada and the US Parks Service jointly published a feasibility study of creating a transboundary protected area here, along with the San Juan Islands and Point Roberts. However, with the provincial government satisfied with the provincial park system in the Gulf Islands and reluctant to forgo resource extraction and development rights, progress towards establishing a national park was delayed until the 1995 announcement of the Canada-British Columbia Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy program. Both the federal and provincial governments pledged $30 million each to acquiring land for conservation purposes generally in the Strait of Georgia area but with the intent of establishing a national park.

On July 26, 2002, of ecologically sensitive land on Saturna Island was donated to the Gulf Island National Park Reserve by Ulla Ressner and John Fry. The park was formally announced on May 9, 2003, with the signing of a memorandum of understanding to take the steps necessary to transfer the agreed upon of lands to the federal government for use as national park. The province followed through in April 2004 with Orders-in-Council 402-404 releasing the properties and all their rights to the Parks Canada including nine provincial parks (Beaumont Marine Park, Cabbage Island Marine Park, D&#x27;Arcy Island Marine Park, Isle-de-Lis Marine Park, Princess Margaret Marine Park, Sidney Spit Marine Park, Winter Cove Marine Park, Prior Centennial Park and McDonald Park), as well as the Saturna Island Ecological Reserve and the Brackman Island Ecological Reserve. The former-provincial parks would include almost all of the new National Park&#x27;s recreational facilities (e.g. camping sites, anchorages, etc.). In addition, more land on Saturna and Pender Islands were added, as well as Reay Island, Greig Island, Hawkins Island, Imrie Island, the Belle Chain Islets, the Channel Islets, and the Red Islets, among other islets.

==Climate==
The park, along with the Strait of Georgia Lowlands natural region, is situated in a low-lying coastal area surrounded by mountains. While the area experiences the warm air from the Pacific Ocean jet stream, the surrounding mountains of Vancouver Island and the Olympic Mountains strips that air of moisture creating a rain shadow effect. The summers are consequently dry with only a few cloudy days which is classified as a Mediterranean climate. The winters, however, are influenced by Arctic air mixing with Pacific air flows resulting in heavy precipitation and cool temperatures. The park includes a climate monitoring station, in operation since 1989, on Saturna Island; the area experiences an average of of precipitation each year, with over half of that falling in the four-month period between October and February.

==Ecology==

The terrestrial portion of the park lies within what the province terms the Coastal Douglas-Fir Biogeoclimatic Zone based on the climax vegetation. Coastal Douglas-fir is the most common tree species and is accompanied by western red cedar and grand fir in wetter soils and Arbutus and Garry oak in drier soils. Also present are red alder, shore pine, Pacific dogwood, bigleaf maple, and bitter cherry. In the shrub layer are salal, dull Oregon-grape, oceanspray, baldhip rose, bracken fern, sword fern, lady fern and spiny wood fern. In wetter areas salmonberry, false lily of the valley, vanilla-leaf, and skunk cabbage may be present.

In the sea waters swim orcas, porpoises, seals, salmon, lingcod, shiner perch, saddleback gunnel and three-spined stickleback, among others. The largest land animal in the park would be the black-tailed deer. Fallow deer are also present but are an introduced species from some of the island&#x27;s history as private hunting grounds. Other terrestrial animals include mink, river otters, raccoons and deer mice. Birds that be seen in the park include cormorant, bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, falcon, turkey vulture, rhinoceros auklet, Brant geese, great blue heron, Hermann&#x27;s Gulls, and oystercatcher.

==Geography==
The park consists of of land and of water scattered over and around 16 islands and more than 30 islets and reefs at the southern end of the Gulf Islands archipelago in the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait and Boundary Pass on the Canadian side of the international border with the United States. The islands have a northwesterly-southeasterly alignment which is partly the result of sedimentary folding within the Nanaimo Basin. Also partly responsible for the shape of the land is the effects of the last ice age when 1.5 km of ice was top off the land and the erosive force carved out softer deposits as the melting water drained into the Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Georgia. Also, the land continues to experience post-glacial rebound which has lifted certain lands higher.

===SMONEĆTEN Campground===
The park&#x27;s most accessible feature is the SMONEĆTEN Campground in North Saanich on Vancouver Island, just north of the Town of Sidney. While it covers a area consisting of second-growth forest, the site is divided by the Highway 17 and the Swartz Bay Road overpass and surrounded by urban and agricultural development. The campground had been operated as a provincial park since 1948 before being transferred to Parks Canada in 2004. The campground includes 49 drive-in, frontcountry campsites with potable water, pit toilets, and picnic tables. In 2021, the campground was renamed from McDonald Campground to SMONEĆTEN in collaboration between Parks Canada and the W̱SÁNEĆ Leadership Council.

===Sidney Island===

The Sidney Island portion of the national park comprises the northern of the island along with another of foreshore area. Its most prominent features are two spits which create long, sandy beaches. Sidney Spit extends for more than to a light beacon at its point. Hook Spit is situated partly down the island and creates a sheltered lagoon with beds of eelgrass. Located off the coast of Town of Sidney, in the Haro Strait, it is accessible only by private boat, passenger ferry or small plane via an airstrip further down the island. Like SMONEĆTEN Campground, recreational park facilities, like a campground, dock, and moorings were developed during the years when it was operated as a provincial park. Historically, this area had been used by First Nations people for clam harvesting, before being subjected to a failed residential subdivision by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1860, clay extraction for a brickworks between 1906 and 1915, logging of old growth trees, and the introduction of non-native animals like deer and peacocks from farming operations and its use as a private hunting ground before the province used the area in the late-1950s to test the concept of a marine park. Being well-received, the province formalized it as a provincial park in 1961 and developed mooring buoys and an anchoring area, with an on-shore dock for passenger ferries, a campground, pit toilets, and water taps.

===D&#x27;Arcy Island===
The southernmost area in the park, along with the Unit Rocks and the Sallas Rocks, is D&#x27;Arcy Island in the Haro Strait. It is an island, with a 25-meter buffer of national park waters surrounding it, primarily accessible by sea kayak from Island View Regional Park in Central Saanich, or otherwise by motorboat though there are no docking or mooring facilities. Like Sidney Island, it was developed as a marine park with backcountry campsites, with pit toilets but no potable water, and cross-island hiking trails by the province beginning in 1961 before being transferred to Parks Canada in 2004. Some ruins of old buildings, along with a memorial plaque, remain from its time as a leper colony, between 1891 and 1924.

===Isle-de-Lis===
East of Sidney Island, and east of the privately owned Gooch Island, is the Isle-de-Lis, formerly known as Rum Island as it was used by rum-runners during prohibition in the United States, being less than one mile from the international border. Isle-de-Lis was a private island until 1978 when it was bequeathed to the province for park purposes and renamed to Isle-de-Lis. Like D&#x27;Arcy Island, the province made it into a marine park primarily accessible by sea kayakers on a multi-day trip, with no docking or mooring facilities for motorboats, and added backcountry campsites with pit toilets but no potable water.

===Portland Island===
On the northern end of the Haro Strait is a area of the national park centred on Portland Island and extending out to include Brackman Island and numerous islets (but, excluding several private islands). Brackman Island was an ecological reserve prior to its inclusion into the national park as a special preservation area. Archaeological sites in the form of midden deposits remain on Portland Island from a long-abandoned First Nation village. Similarly, evidence remains of its use as a private island, including agricultural development and logging; though, it reverted to the provincial Crown after the owner&#x27;s bankruptcy in the Great Depression. The island was given to Princess Margaret to commemorate her 1958 tour of British Columbia and she donated it back to the Crown in Right of British Columbia for park purposes. The province subsequently operated it as the Princess Margaret Marine Park with anchorages, an artificial reef suitable for scuba diving, hiking trails around the island, and three campgrounds with pit toilets, but, no potable water, until it was transferred to Parks Canada.

===Russell Island===
Located in the Satellite Channel off the southern coast of Salt Spring Island, Russell Island includes an anchorage area and a small dock with a loop trail for recreational use. As a cultural heritage sites, there is a foreshore clam garden developed by First Nations people and the Mahoi House developed when Russell Island was a private island owned by a Native Hawaiian family between 1886 and 1959 (and also inhabited by subsequent owner). It remained a private island until 1997 when it was purchased in the Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy program for park purposes.

===Pender Island===
Pender Island is serviced by BC Ferries which allows for the use of drive-in campsites at the Prior Centennial Campground. A second campground is located along Bedwell Harbour in the former Beaumont Marine Provincial Park. In addition to the backcountry campsites, there are also mooring buoys and an anchoring area for boaters and a sandy beach access for kayakers, as well as a hiking trail along the beach and up Mount Norman. The Roesland park area on North Pender, acquired through a series of private land purchases, has a third campground. This campground is located near the shore of Shingle Bay and is accessible by kayakers or boaters as there is an anchoring area and a sandy beach access with a dinghy dock, but is also accessible via a short but steep hike from the Shingle Bay Road parking lot. This Roesland park area also includes a loop-trail around Roe Lake and a shorter hike from a historical/interpretative centre to Roe Islet (accessible during low tide). There are two other national park areas on the island. On South Pender, there is a hiking trail from Gowlland Point Road to Greenburn Lake. On North Pender, from a trailhead in an Islands Trust conservation area, there is a hiking trail up Mount Menzies through Loretta&#x27;s Wood and another trail through Tyndall Wood to cliffs which overlook Plumper Sound and Saturna Island.

===Saturna Island===
Approximately half of the island is in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (GINPR) that was formed in 2003 from a gift of ecologically sensitive land by Ulla Ressner and John Fry, existing provincial parks, an Ecological Reserve, and other Crown land. There is also a large First Nations reserve on the island. The island has a permanent population of around 350, although that number increases significantly during the busy summer season.

The national park covers approximately 43% of Saturna Island&#x27;s land base. The Ressner-Fry and other GINPR property on Mount Fisher are not accessible. The Winter Cove day use area is the most visited park area on Saturna Island. It surrounds a cove with a sheltered moorage area and a dinghy dock. On land the day use area includes a picnic area and a trail through a variety of landscapes such as forested uplands, open meadows, salt marshes, shell midden, and sandstone beaches, to a viewpoint at Boat Pass. The Narvaez Bay park area includes several connected hiking trails, along the coastline and through the forest to the Monarch Head viewpoint which overlooks Boundary Pass and the American San Juan Islands. The Narvaez Bay campground is the only campground within the island&#x27;s park boundaries and is accessible by kayak, or from an off-shore anchoring area or by walking in from a parking lot. At the end of the northern peninsula is a small park area with a sandstone beach that surrounds the East Point Light Station and Fog Alarm Building with the Boiling Reef just off-shore. The middle of the island is a large park area that covers land from the valley bottom of Lyall Creek to the plateau of Mt. David and Mt. Elsford to the north and to the plateau of Mount Warburton Pike and Brown Ridge to the south. The Lyall Creek trail follows a salmon-bearing creek to a seasonal waterfall, while the Mount Warburton Pike trail (at the end of Staples Road) follows the grassy ridgeline at a height of 400 metres overlooking the Taylor Point trail along the southern coast of the island and Plumper Sound, Pender Island and the San Juan Islands. Similarly, the height of Mount Fisher west of Mount Warburton Pike is also included within the park, though it is not accessible. The Taylor Point trail is a trail along coastal bluffs, from the end of Trueworthy Road, past an abandoned sandstone quarry to Taylor Point where there are the ruins of a settler&#x27;s house, constructed of sandstone in 1892.

===Tumbo Island - Cabbage Island===

Located off Saturna Island&#x27;s northeastern shore, Tumbo Island and Cabbage Island are connected to each other by a reef, exposed at low tide. Cabbage Island, purchased by the Nature Conservancy from private owners in 1976, was developed as a provincial marine park between 1978 and 2004 with anchorage and moorage areas in Reef Harbour and a campground and on the island. Tumbo, in area and named in reference to a tombolo, was acquired by the province in the Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy program from a Californian for $3.7 million with the provision that he was able to keep his cottage and care-taker suite. Prior to its use as private property (since 1877) for timber harvesting, coal mining, mink farming, and recreational living, it was used by the Coast Salish people when crossing or working in the strait. Tumbo is also only accessible by boats via Reef Harbour and it beach accesses but while it does not have a campground does have a 3.5 km trail, with views of the San Juan Islands.

===Mayne Island===

There are two national park sites on Mayne Island: Campbell Point (Bennett Bay) on the eastern end and Georgina Point on the island&#x27;s northwestern end. The Georgina Point Heritage Park is a site that looks upon the Strait of Georgia and the entrance of Active Pass. It has been the site of the Active Pass Lighthouse since 1885, though that original light was replaced in 1940 with a lightkeeper&#x27;s residence that included a lantern room above, and then in 1969 by an octagonal metal lantern mounted on a cylindrical concrete tower. The light function was also replaced, in 1997, by an automated navigational aid. As the historical structures remain, as well as the active radio building and aeronautical beacon maintained by the Coast Guard, it is listed as a historic place and heritage lighthouse. With the site transferred from Fisheries and Oceans Canada to Parks Canada it was further developed with picnic and washroom facilities. On the other end of the island, the Campbell Point portion was acquired as a private land purchase. There is a hiking trail from a sandy beach, suitable for swimming and launching kayaks, to Campbell Point where there are views of Georgeson Island&#x27;s old-growth forest on a sandstone ridge. Georgeson Island, along with the seal and sea lion haulouts of the Belle Chain Islets and Anniversary Island, and the small unnamed islands off Samuel Island&#x27;s coast, make for a kayak route between Mayne and Saturna islands, within the national park boundaries.

===Prevost Island===
There are two park areas on Prevost Island. The north park site, acquired by private land purchases, extends from Peile Point around James Bay to Selby Cove, though the land on Selby Point remains privately owned. There is a campground, with a pit toilet but no potable water, on the shores of James Bay with a hiking trail to and Selby Cove. While the camping is suitable for kayakers, there are anchorage areas in James Bay and Selby Cove for boaters. On the east end of the island, the park site extends from Portlock Point around Richardson Bay to the Bright and Red Islets. This site includes the Portlock Point Lighthouse and a beach access but no campground. Between these two park sites, the national park also includes the small area of Hawkins Island off the northern coast of Prevost Island.

<text>Uta Thyra Hagen (12 June 1919 – 14 January 2004) was a German-American actress and theatre practitioner. She originated the role of Martha in the 1962 Broadway premiere of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; by Edward Albee, who called her &quot;a profoundly truthful actress.&quot; Because Hagen was on the Hollywood blacklist, in part because of her association with Paul Robeson, her film opportunities dwindled and she focused her career on New York theatre.

She later became a highly influential acting teacher at New York&#x27;s Herbert Berghof Studio and authored best-selling acting texts, &quot;Respect for Acting&quot;, with Haskel Frankel, and &quot;A Challenge for the Actor&quot;. Her most substantial contributions to theatre pedagogy were a series of &quot;object exercises&quot; that built on the work of Konstantin Stanislavski and Yevgeny Vakhtangov.

She was elected to the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981. She twice won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1999.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born in Göttingen, Germany, daughter of Thyra A. (née Leisner), a trained opera singer, and Oskar Hagen, an art historian and musician, Hagen and her family emigrated to the United States in 1924. Uta was raised in Madison, Wisconsin; her father taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Her early years in Germany were likely affected by the growing political changes in Europe, which would have added a layer of complexity to their decision to emigrate. She appeared in productions of the University of Wisconsin High School and in summer stock productions of the Wisconsin Players. She later studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London for a brief period in 1936. She studied acting briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1936. After spending one semester at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where her father was the head of the department of art history, she left for New York City in 1937. Her first professional role was as Ophelia opposite Eva Le Gallienne in the title role of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Dennis, Massachusetts, in 1936.

===Career===
Hagen was cast, early on, as Ophelia by the actress-manager Eva Le Gallienne. Hagen went on to play (at age 18) the leading ingénue role of Nina in a Broadway production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. &quot;The Lunts,&quot; she later stated, &quot;were an enormous influence on my life.&quot; She admired &quot;their passion for the theatre, and their discipline.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ critic Brooks Atkinson hailed her Nina as &quot;grace and aspiration incarnate.&quot;

She played George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1951) on Broadway, and Desdemona in a production which toured. Later she acted with Paul Robeson in Shakespeare&#x27;s Othello; her then-husband José Ferrer was Iago. She took over the role of Blanche DuBois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; for the national tour, which was directed by Harold Clurman. In &quot;Respect for Acting&quot;, she credited her discoveries with Clurman as the springboard for what she would later explore with her husband Herbert Berghof: &quot;how to find a true technique of acting, how to make a character flow through me.&quot; She played Blanche (on the road and on Broadway) opposite at least four different Stanley Kowalskis, including Anthony Quinn and Marlon Brando. 

Primarily noted for stage roles, Hagen won her first Tony Award in 1951 for her performance as the self-sacrificing wife Georgie in Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;The Country Girl&quot;. She won again in 1963 for originating the role of Martha in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;. In 1981 she was elected to the American Theater Hall of Fame and in 1999 received a &quot;Special Lifetime Achievement Tony Award.&quot;

Although she appeared in some movies after 1972, the Hollywood blacklist limited her output in film and television. She would later comment about being blacklisted, &quot;that fact kept me pure.&quot;

She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series&quot; for her performance on the television soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

She taught at HB Studio, a New York City acting school. She began there in 1947, and married its co-founder, Herbert Berghof, on 25 January 1957. Hagen was an influential acting teacher who taught, among others, Matthew Broderick, Christine Lahti, Amanda Peet, Hope Davis, Jason Robards, Sigourney Weaver, Katie Finneran, Liza Minnelli, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Charles Nelson Reilly, Manu Tupou, Debbie Allen, Herschel Savage, George Segal, Jon Stewart, and Al Pacino. She was a voice coach to Judy Garland, teaching her a German accent for the picture &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;. Garland&#x27;s performance earned her an Academy Award nomination.

Later in life, Hagen returned to the stage, earning accolades for leading roles in &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (1985), &quot;Collected Stories&quot;, and &quot;Mrs. Klein&quot;. After Berghof&#x27;s death in 1990, she became the school&#x27;s chairperson.

She also wrote &quot;Respect for Acting&quot; (1973) and &quot;A Challenge for the Actor&quot; (1991), which advocate realistic (as opposed to &quot;formalistic&quot;) acting. In her mode of realism, the actor puts his own psyche to use in finding identification with the role,&quot; trusting that a form will result. In &quot;Respect for Acting&quot;, Hagen credited director Harold Clurman with a turn-around in her perspective on acting:

In 1947, I worked in a play under the direction of Harold Clurman. He opened a new world in the professional theatre for me. He took away my &#x27;tricks&#x27;. He imposed no line readings, no gestures, no positions on the actors. At first I floundered badly because for many years I had become accustomed to using specific outer directions as the material from which to construct the mask for my character, the mask behind which I would hide throughout the performance. Mr Clurman refused to accept a mask. He demanded ME in the role. My love of acting was slowly reawakened as I began to deal with a strange new technique of evolving in the character. I was not allowed to begin with, or concern myself at any time with, a preconceived form. I was assured that a form would result from the work we were doing.

Hagen later &quot;disassociated&quot; herself from &quot;Respect for Acting&quot;. In &quot;Challenge for the Actor&quot;, she redefined a term which she had initially called &quot;substitution,&quot; an esoteric technique for mixing elements of an actor&#x27;s life with his/her character work, calling it &quot;transference&quot; instead. &quot;Respect for Acting&quot; was used as a textbook for many college acting classes. She also wrote a 1976 cookbook, &quot;Love for Cooking&quot;. In 2002, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President George W. Bush at a ceremony held at the White House.

Harvey Korman talks about studying under her during his Archive of American Television interview in 2004. David Hyde Pierce worked with Hagen in the Richard Alfieri play &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot;, at the Geffen Playhouse in 2001. Hyde Pierce spoke at her 2004 memorial at Manhattan&#x27;s Majestic Theater.

==Personal life==
Uta Hagen was married to José Ferrer from 1938 until 1948. They had one child together, their daughter Leticia (born 15 October 1940). They divorced partly because of Hagen&#x27;s long-concealed affair with Paul Robeson, her co-star in &quot;Othello&quot;. Hagen married Herbert Berghof on 25 January 1957, a union that lasted for 33 years until his death in 1990. Hagen died in Greenwich Village in 2004 after suffering a stroke in 2001.

===In popular culture===
In 2009, Weird Al Yankovic’s “Skipper Dan” referenced Uta Hagen in the opening verse:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;I starred in every high school play&quot;
&quot;Blew every drama teacher away&quot;
&quot;I graduated first in my class at Juilliard&quot;
&quot;Took every acting workshop I could&quot;
&quot;And I dreamed of Hollywood&quot;
&quot;While I read my Uta Hagen&quot;
&quot;and studied the Bard&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

====Theatre====
* Her name was in the song La Vie Bohème from the 1996 rock opera &quot;Rent&quot; written and composed by Jonathan Larson: &quot;To the stage, To Uta, To Buddha, Pablo Neruda too.&quot;

==Quotes==

* &quot;Once in a while, there&#x27;s stuff that makes me say, &#x27;That&#x27;s what theatre&#x27;s about&#x27;. It has to be a human event on the stage, and that doesn&#x27;t happen very often.&quot;
* &quot;Awards don&#x27;t really mean much.&quot;

<text>The Tokyo Institute of Technology () was a public university in Meguro, Tokyo, Japan. It merged with Tokyo Medical and Dental University to form the Institute of Science Tokyo on 1 October 2024. 

The Tokyo Institute of Technology was a Designated National University and a Top Type university of Top Global University Project designated by the Japanese government. Tokyo Tech&#x27;s main campus was located at Ōokayama on the boundary of Meguro and Ota, with its main entrance facing the Ōokayama Station. Other campuses are located in Suzukakedai and Tamachi. Tokyo Tech was organised into 6 schools, within which there are over 40 departments and research centres. Tokyo Tech enrolled 4,734 undergraduates and 1,464 graduate students for 2015–2016.

==History==

===Foundation and early years (1881–1922)===
Tokyo Institute of Technology was founded by the government of Japan as the Tokyo Vocational School on May 26, 1881, 14 years after the Meiji Restoration. To accomplish the quick catch-up to the West, the government expected this school to cultivate new modernized craftsmen and engineers. In 1890, it was renamed &quot;Tokyo Technical School&quot;. In 1901, it changed name to &quot;Tokyo Higher Technical School&quot;.

===Great Kantō earthquake and World War II (1923–1945)===
In early days, the school was located in Kuramae, the eastern area of the Greater Tokyo Area, where many craftsmens&#x27; workshops had been since the old Shōgun&#x27;s era. The buildings in Kuramae campus were destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. In the following year, the Tokyo Higher Technical School moved from Kuramae to the present site in Ōokayama, a south suburb of the Greater Tokyo Area. In 1929, the school became Tokyo University of Engineering, later renamed to Tokyo Institute of Technology around 1946, gaining a status of national university, which allowed the university to award degrees. The university had the Research Laboratory of Building Materials in 1934, and five years later, the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilisation and the Research Laboratory of Precision Machinery were constructed. The Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry was made in 1943, and one year before World War Two ended, the Research Laboratory of Fuel Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics were founded.

===Post-War Era (1946–present)===
After World War II, the new education system was promulgated in 1949 with the &quot;National School Establishment Law&quot;, and Tokyo Institute of Technology was reorganized. Many three-year courses were turned into four-year courses with the start of the School of Engineering this year. The university started graduate programmes in engineering in 1953. In the following year, the six research laboratories were integrated and reorganised into four new labs: the Research Laboratory of Building Materials, the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization, the Precision and Intelligence Laboratory and the Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry, and the School of Engineering was renamed the School of Science and Engineering.

Throughout the post-war reconstruction of the 1950s, the high economic growth era of the 1960s, and the aggressive economic era marching to the Bubble Economy of the 1980s, TIT kept providing Japan its leading engineers, researchers, and business persons. Since April 2004, it has been semi-privatized into the National University Incorporation of Tokyo Institute of Technology under a new law which applied to all national universities.

Operating the world-class supercomputer Tsubame 2.0, and making a breakthrough in high-temperature superconductivity, Tokyo Tech was a major centre for supercomputing technology and condensed matter research in the world.

In 2011, it celebrated the 130th anniversary of its founding. In 2014, it joined the edX consortium and formed the Online Education Development Office (OEDO) to create MOOCS, which are hosted on the edX website.

In its 130 years, Tokyo Tech has provided scientific researchers, engineers and many social leaders, including Naoto Kan who was a former prime minister.

===Libraries===
The main library was the Tokyo Institute of Technology Library in Ookayama. It was the home of Japan&#x27;s largest science and technology library. The library was founded in 1882, and it lost nearly 28,000 books during the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. Moved to Ookayama in 1936, it has been the national science and technology library of Japan.

1,200 students and staff visit the library each day.
It has 674,000 books and 2,500 journals, including 1,600 foreign academic journals; the number of international research collections was the largest in Japan. It provides around 7,000 registered electronic journals each year. The library was therefore recognised for the outstanding national and international importance and awarded &#x27;Centre of foreign journals&#x27; by the government of Japan. Renewal construction of the library was completed in July 2011.

<doc id="432608" wikidata="Q29122" url="?curid=432608" title="First Anglo-Burmese War">
<text>The First Anglo-Burmese War (; ; 5 March 1824 – 24 February 1826), also known as the First Burma War in English language accounts and First English Invasion War () in Burmese language accounts, was the first of three wars fought between the British and Burmese empires in the 19th century. The war, which began primarily over the control of what is now Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese submitted to a British demand to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and signed a commercial treaty.

The war was one of the most expensive in British Indian history. Fifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died, together with an unknown number of Burmese military and civilian casualties. The high cost of the campaign to the British, 5–13 million pounds sterling (£ – £ as of ) contributed to a severe economic crisis in British India which cost the East India Company its remaining privileges.

Although once strong enough to threaten the interests of the British East India Company (especially with respect to the eastern border regions of Assam, Manipur, and Arakan), the Burmese Empire now suffered &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; of its status as an independent nation. They would be economically burdened for years to come by the cost of the indemnity. The British, eventually waging the Second and Third Anglo-Burmese Wars against a much-weakened Burma, would assume control of the entire country by 1885.

==Causes==
By 1822, Burmese expansion into Manipur and Assam and its &quot;forward policy&quot; of probing into the hill states of Jaintia and Cachar, had put pressure on British Bengal. Calcutta unilaterally declared Cachar and Jaintia British protectorates and sent in troops.

Cross-border raids into these newly acquired territories from British territories and spheres of influence vexed the Burmese. Convinced that war was inevitable, Burmese commander-in-chief Maha Bandula became the main proponent of offensive policy against the British. Bandula was part of the war party at Bagyidaw&#x27;s court, which also included Queen Me Nu and her brother, the Lord of Salin. Bandula believed that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar, and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal.

In September 1823, the &quot;casus belli&quot; was Burma occupying Shalpuri Island near Chittagong, which was claimed by the East India Company.

In January 1824, Burma sent one of their top generals, Thado Thiri Maha Uzana, into Cachar and Jaintia to disperse the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan.

The British reason for the war was, in addition to expanding British Bengal&#x27;s sphere of influence, the desire for new markets for British manufacturing. The British were also anxious to deny the French the use of Burmese harbours and concerned about French influence at the Court of Ava, as the kingdom was still known to them. British Ambassador Michael Symes&#x27;s mission was equipped to gain as much knowledge as possible of the country for future British plans whereas previous envoys were concerned principally with trade concessions.

Anglo-French rivalry had already played a role during Alaungpaya&#x27;s endeavours of unifying the kingdom. The Burmese in these wars were advancing into smaller states not ruled by the British or the subject of expansionist goals by the British before the war began, and the British were not so much preoccupied by the refugee problem initially as by the threat posed by the French until further incidents forced their hand.

==War==
===Western theatre===
The commander in chief of the Burmese army, Maha Bandula, was supported by twelve of the country&#x27;s best divisions, including one under his personal command, all totaling 10,000 men and 500 horses. His general staff included some of the country&#x27;s most decorated soldiers, men such as the Lord of Salay and the governors of Danyawaddy, Wuntho, and Taungoo. Bandula&#x27;s plan was to attack the British on two fronts: Chittagong from Arakan in the southeast, and Sylhet from Cachar and Jaintia in the north. Bandula personally commanded the Arakan theatre while Uzana commanded the Cachar and Jaintia theater.

Early in the war, battle-hardened Burmese forces were able to push back the British forces because the Burmese, who had been fighting in the jungles of Manipur and Assam for nearly a decade, were more familiar with the terrain, which represented &quot;a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force&quot;. Uzana had already defeated the British units in Cachar and Jaintia in January 1824. The British sent reinforcements but they were largely indecisive.

In May, a Burmese column of some 4000 men led by Maha Thiha Thura, fought their way into Bengal, defeating British troops at the Battle of Ramu, east of Cox&#x27;s Bazar, on 17 May 1824. Sa&#x27;s column then joined Bandula&#x27;s column on the march to defeat British forces at Gadawpalin, and went on to capture Cox&#x27;s Bazar. The Burmese success caused extreme panic in Chittagong and in Calcutta. Across the eastern Bengal, the European inhabitants formed themselves into militia forces. A large portion of the crews of the East India Company&#x27;s ships was landed to assist in the defense of Calcutta.

But Bandula, not wanting to overstretch, stopped U Sa from proceeding to Chittagong. Had Bandula marched on to Chittagong, which unbeknown to him was lightly held, he could have taken it and the way to Calcutta would have opened. Had they been able to threaten Calcutta, the Burmese could have obtained more favourable terms in the subsequent peace negotiations.

===Inside Burma===


====Battle of Yangon (May–December 1824)====
Instead of fighting in hard terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May 1824, a British naval force of over 10,000 men (5,000 British soldiers and over 5,000 Indian sepoys) entered the harbour of Yangon (Rangoon), taking the Burmese by surprise. The Burmese, pursuing a scorched earth policy, left an empty city behind and chose to fortify positions along an east–west arc outside the city. The British forces led by General Archibald Campbell took positions inside the Shwedagon Pagoda compound, which was fortified. The British launched attacks on Burmese lines and, by July 1824, had successfully pushed the Burmese towards Kamayut, from Shwedagon. Burmese efforts to retake Shwedagon in September failed.

King Bagyidaw ordered a near-complete withdrawal from the western front—Bandula from Arakan and Bengal, and Uzana from Assam, Cachar, and Jaintia to meet the British in Yangon. In August, in the midst of monsoon season, Bandula and his army crossed the Arakan Yoma. Moving tens of thousands of men over the 3,000-foot-high Arakan hills, or 10,000-foot-high Assamese ranges, heavily forested with only narrow footpaths and open to attack by tigers and leopards, would have been difficult even in mild weather conditions. The King later granted both Bandula and Uzana the title Agga Maha Thenapati (), the highest possible military rank. Bandula was also made the governor of Sittaung.

By November, Bandula commanded a large army outside Yangon. There is great disparancy of the numbers ranging from 30,000 to 60,000 mostly from British sources. Terrance Blackburn discuss the numbers and felt that Campbell had exaggerated the Burmese numbers in his reports to imply that the British only needed a few to vanquish a vast horde sent against them. According to the Burmese royal chronicles, the number was around 16,000. 

Bandula believed that he could take on a well-armed British force of 10,000 head-on. Although the Burmese were numerically superior, only around half the army were musketeers with the rest armed with spears and swords. The Burmese cannons fired only balls whereas the British cannons fired exploding shells. Unbeknown to him, the British had just received the first shipment of Congreve rockets, a new weapon in the war that the Burmese had never seen. More ominously for the Burmese, the speedy march through the hilly regions of Rakhine Yoma and Assamese ranges had left their troops exhausted.

On 30 November, in what turned out be the biggest mistake of his career, Bandula ordered a frontal attack on British positions. The British, with superior weaponry, withstood several Burmese charges at the Shwedagon fort, cutting down men by the thousands. By 7 December, the British troops, supported by rocket fire, had begun to gain the upper hand. On 15 December, the Burmese were driven out of their last remaining stronghold at Kokine.

In the end, only 7,000 of the 16,000 Burmese soldiers returned to the royal army. Campbell&#x27;s despatches stated the Burmese suffered some 6,000 casualties over the fifteen day battle. The rest of the Burmese army, most of them conscripts fled and returned to their homes. The British losses were considered heavy in proportion as well: 40 officers and 500 other ranks were killed or wounded in combat with a much larger number ill from disease.

====Battle of Danubyu (March–April 1825)====
Bandula fell back to his rear base at Danubyu, a small town not far from Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta. Having lost experienced men in Yangon, the Burmese forces now numbered about 10,000, of mixed quality, including some of the king&#x27;s best soldiers but also many untrained and barely armed conscripts. The stockade itself stretched along the riverbank, and was made up of solid teak beams no less than high.

In March 1825, a four thousand strong British force supported by a flotilla of gunboats attacked Danubyu. The first British attack failed, and Bandula attempted a counter-charge, with foot soldiers, cavalry and 17 fighting elephants. But the elephants were stopped by rocket fire and the cavalry found it impossible to move against the sustained British artillery fire.

On 1 April, the British launched a major attack, pounding down on the town with their heavy guns and raining their rockets on every part of the Burmese line. Bandula was killed by a mortar shell. Bandula had walked around the fort to boost the morale of his men, in his full insignia under a glittering golden umbrella, disregarding the warnings of his generals that he would prove an easy target for the enemy&#x27;s guns. After Bandula&#x27;s death, the Burmese evacuated Danubyu.

====Arakan campaign (February–April 1825)====
U Sa was left to command the remaining Burmese troops in Arakan after Bandula&#x27;s death and the main battalions were ordered to withdraw from Arakan by Bagyidaw to meet the British invasion in Yangon in August 1824. Sa held on to Arakan throughout 1824 while fighting was concentrated in Yangon.

After Gen. Archibald Campbell finally defeated Gen. Bandula in the Battle of Yangon in December 1824, the British turned their sights on Arakan. On 1 February 1825, an invasion force of 11,000 soldiers supported by gunboats and armed cruisers along the coast, as well as a squadron of cavalry under the command of Gen. Morrison, attacked Burmese positions in Arakan. Despite their superior numbers and firearms, the British had to fight depleted Burmese forces for nearly two months before they reached the main Burmese garrison at Mrauk-U, Arakan&#x27;s capital.

On 29 March 1825, the British launched their attack on Mrauk-U. (At the same time, Campbell also launched an attack on Bandula&#x27;s positions in the Battle of Danubyu.) After a few days of fighting, the Burmese forces at Mrauk-U were defeated on 1 April, coincidentally the same day Maha Bandula fell at Danubyu. Sa and the remaining Burmese forces evacuated and left Arakan. The British proceeded to occupy the rest of Arakan.

====Armistice====
On 17 September 1825, an armistice was concluded for one month. In the course of the summer, General Joseph Wanton Morrison had conquered the province of Arakan; in the north, the Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some progress in Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by the thick forests and jungle.

Peace negotiations that began in September broke down by early October after the Burmese would not agree to British terms. The British had demanded no less than the complete dismemberment of the Burmese western territories in Arakan, Assam, Manipur, and the Tenasserim coast as well as two million pounds sterling of indemnity. The Burmese would not agree to give up Arakan and the large sum of indemnity.

====Battle of Prome (November–December 1825)====

In November 1825, the Burmese decided to throw everything they had into a last-ditch effort. Starting in mid-November, the Burmese forces, consisting mainly of Shan regiments led by their sawbwas, threatened Prome in a daring circular movement that almost surrounded the town and cut off communications lines to Yangon. In the end, the superior firepower of the British guns and missiles won out. On 1 December, Gen. Campbell, with 2500 European and 1500 Indian sepoys, supported by a flotilla of gunboats, attacked the main Burmese position outside Prome. On 2 December, Maha Ne Myo was killed by a shell launched from the flotilla. After Maha Ne Myo&#x27;s death, the British dislodged the Burmese by 5 December.

The defeat in Prome effectively left the Burmese army in disarray, and it was in constant retreat from then on. On 26 December, they sent a flag of truce to the British camp. Negotiations having commenced, the Burmese capitulated to the British terms to end the war, signing the Treaty of Yandabo in February 1826.

==Treaty of Yandabo==
The British demanded and the Burmese agreed to:

:# Cede to the British Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan), and Taninthayi (Tenasserim) coast south of the Salween River
:# Cease all interference in Cachar and Jaintia
:# Pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling in four installments
:# Allow for an exchange of diplomatic representatives between Ava and Calcutta
:# Sign a commercial treaty in due course
:# The first installment of indemnity was to be paid immediately, the second installment within the first 100 days from signing of the treaty, and the rest within two years. Until the second installment was paid, the British would not leave Yangon.

The Treaty of Yandabo was signed by General Campbell from the British side and Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side on 24 February 1826. The Burmese paid 250,000 pounds sterling in gold and silver bullion as the first installment of the indemnity, and also released British prisoners of war. The war was thus brought to an end, and the British army moved south. The British army remained in the territories surrendered to it under the treaty and in the territories such as the Rangoon area which were occupied for several years to guarantee compliance with the financial terms of the treaty.

==Aftermath==

While both nations suffered heavy military and financial losses, the treaty imposed a more severe financial burden on the Burmese Kingdom and effectively left it crippled.

The British terms in the negotiations were strongly influenced by the heavy cost in lives and money which the war had entailed. Some 40,000 British and Indians troops had been involved, of whom 15,000 died. British casualties were blamed on poor planning and logistics as only a quarter of the casualties were from the fighting while almost 70% were from tropical diseases. In the Arakan Campaign alone, 659 Europeans out of 1,500 and some 3,500 Indians out of a total of 8,000 died in hospital. The 1st Madras European Regiment lost 600 out of 900 men in two years. Despite the official reports&#x27; emphasis on the disparity of death from disease and combat casualties, Captain Frederick Doveton commented on the British casualties that they were nevertheless high for the troops that engaged, &quot;in the case before us the proportion of killed and wounded to the numbers engaged and space of time occupied may bear in comparison to the palmy and bloody days of Talavera and Waterloo!&quot; According to Campbell&#x27;s casualty list in Burma, the 11,000 expedition suffered some 5,000 combat casualties.

The cost to British India&#x27;s finances had been almost ruinous, amounting to approximately 13 million pounds sterling. The cost of war contributed to a severe economic crisis in India, which by 1833 had bankrupted the Bengal agency houses and cost the British East India Company its remaining privileges, including the monopoly of trade to China.

For the Burmese, the treaty was a total humiliation and a long-lasting financial burden. A whole generation of men had been wiped out in battle. The world the Burmese knew, of conquest and martial pride, built on the back of the impressive military success of the previous seventy-five years, had come crashing down. The Court of Ava could not come to terms with the loss of the territories and made unsuccessful attempts to get them back. An uninvited British resident in Ava was a daily reminder of the humiliating defeat.

In addition, the burden of indemnity left the Burmese royal treasury bankrupt for years. The indemnity of one million pounds sterling was considered a large sum in Europe at that time. It appeared even more daunting when converted to the Burmese kyat equivalent of 10 million. The cost of living of the average villager in Upper Burma in 1826 was one kyat per month.

The British would wage two less expensive wars against the weaker Burmese in 1852 and 1885, and annex Burma by 1885.

<text>In statistics, deviance is a goodness-of-fit statistic for a statistical model; it is often used for statistical hypothesis testing. It is a generalization of the idea of using the sum of squares of residuals (SSR) in ordinary least squares to cases where model-fitting is achieved by maximum likelihood. It plays an important role in exponential dispersion models and generalized linear models.

Deviance can be related to Kullback-Leibler divergence.

==Definition==
The unit deviance formula_1 is a bivariate function that satisfies the following conditions:
* formula_2
* formula_3
The total deviance formula_4 of a model with predictions formula_5 of the observation formula_6 is the sum of its unit deviances: formula_7.

The (total) deviance for a model &quot;M&quot;0 with estimates formula_8, based on a dataset &quot;y&quot;, may be constructed by its likelihood as:
formula_9

Here formula_10 denotes the fitted values of the parameters in the model &quot;M&quot;0, while formula_11 denotes the fitted parameters for the &quot;saturated model&quot;: both sets of fitted values are implicitly functions of the observations &quot;y&quot;. Here, the saturated model is a model with a parameter for every observation so that the data are fitted exactly. This expression is simply 2 times the log-likelihood ratio of the full model compared to the reduced model. The deviance is used to compare two models – in particular in the case of generalized linear models (GLM) where it has a similar role to residual sum of squares from ANOVA in linear models (RSS).

Suppose in the framework of the GLM, we have two nested models, &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M2&quot;. In particular, suppose that &quot;M1&quot; contains the parameters in &quot;M2&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; additional parameters. Then, under the null hypothesis that &quot;M2&quot; is the true model, the difference between the deviances for the two models follows, based on Wilks&#x27; theorem, an approximate chi-squared distribution with &quot;k&quot;-degrees of freedom. This can be used for hypothesis testing on the deviance.

Some usage of the term &quot;deviance&quot; can be confusing. According to Collett:
: &quot;the quantity formula_12 is sometimes referred to as a &quot;deviance&quot;. This is [...] inappropriate, since unlike the deviance used in the context of generalized linear modelling, formula_13 does not measure deviation from a model that is a perfect fit to the data.&quot; 

However, since the principal use is in the form of the difference of the deviances of two models, this confusion in definition is unimportant.

==Examples==
The unit deviance for the Poisson distribution is formula_14, the unit deviance for the normal distribution with unit variance is given by formula_15.

<text>The Seattle Times is an American daily newspaper based in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1891, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region. The Seattle Times Company, which owns and publishes the paper, is mostly owned by the Blethen family, which holds 50.5% of the company; the other 49.5% is owned by The McClatchy Company. The Blethen family has owned and operated the newspaper since 1896. 

&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; had a longstanding rivalry with the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; until the latter ceased physical publication in 2009.

&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; has received 11 Pulitzer Prizes and is widely renowned for its investigative journalism.

==History==
&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; originated as the &quot;Seattle Press-Times&quot;, a four-page newspaper founded in 1891 with a daily circulation of 3,500, which Maine teacher and attorney Alden J. Blethen bought in 1896. Renamed the &quot;Seattle Daily Times&quot;, it doubled its circulation within half a year. By 1915, circulation stood at 70,000.

The newspaper moved to the Times Square Building at 5th Avenue and Olive Way in 1915. It built a new headquarters, the Seattle Times Building, north of Denny Way in 1930. The paper moved to its current headquarters at 1000 Denny Way in 2011. In 1966, the publication changed to its current name of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;.

&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; switched from afternoon delivery to mornings on March 6, 2000, citing that the move would help them avoid the fate of other defunct afternoon newspapers. This placed the &quot;Times&quot; in direct competition with its Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) partner, the morning &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;. Nine years later, the &quot;Post-Intelligencer&quot; became an online-only publication.

The &quot;Times&quot; is one of the few remaining major city dailies in the United States independently operated and owned by a local family (the Blethens). The Seattle Times Company, while owning and operating the &quot;Times&quot;, also owns three other papers in Washington, and formerly owned several newspapers in Maine that were later sold to MaineToday Media. The McClatchy Company owns 49.5% of voting common stock in the Seattle Times Company, formerly held by Knight Ridder until 2006.

==Awards==

&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; has received 11 Pulitzer Prizes, most recently in 2020 for its national reporting of the Boeing 737 MAX crashes by reporters Dominic Gates, Mike Baker, Steve Miletich and Lewis Kamb. It has an international reputation for its investigative journalism in particular. In April 2012, investigative reporters Michael Berens and Ken Armstrong won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for a series documenting more than 2,000 deaths caused by the state of Washington&#x27;s use of methadone as a recommended painkiller in state-supported care. In April 2010, the &quot;Times&quot; staff won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its coverage, in print and online, of the shooting deaths of four police officers in a Lakewood coffee house and the 40-hour manhunt for the suspect. A tenth Pulitzer Prize was awarded in 2015 for breaking news coverage of the Oso mudslide.

&quot;Times&quot; photographer Jerry Gay won the 1975 Spot News Photography prize for &quot;Lull in the Battle&quot;, an image of firefighters resting after fighting a house fire. In 1982, reporter Paul Henderson won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for his coverage of the case of Steve Titus. Titus had been wrongfully convicted of rape, and in a series of articles Henderson challenged the circumstantial evidence in the case, convincing the judge to reverse Titus&#x27; conviction.

==Controversies==
===2002 headline controversy===
In February 2002, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; ran a subheadline &quot;American outshines Kwan, Slutskaya in skating surprise&quot; after Sarah Hughes won the gold medal at the 2002 Olympics. Many Asian Americans felt insulted by the headline because Michelle Kwan is also American. Asian American community leaders criticized the subheadline as perpetuating a stereotype that people of color can never be truly American. The incident echoed a similar incident that happened with an MSNBC article during the Winter games in 1998, which was reported on by &quot;Times&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s Executive Editor at the time of the controversy, Mike Fancher, issued an apology.

===2012 election controversy===
On October 17, 2012, the publishers of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; launched advertising campaigns in support of Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna and a state referendum to legalize same-sex marriage. The newspaper&#x27;s management said the ads were aimed at &quot;demonstrating how effective advertising with &quot;The Times&quot; can be.&quot; The advertisements in favor of McKenna represented an $80,000 independent expenditure, making the newspaper the third largest contributor to his campaign. More than 100 staffers signed a letter of protest sent to &quot;Seattle Times&quot; publisher Frank Blethen, calling it an &quot;unprecedented act&quot;.

==Joint Operating Agreement==
From 1983 to 2009, the &quot;Times&quot; and Seattle&#x27;s other major paper, the Hearst-owned &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, were run under a &quot;Joint Operating Agreement&quot; (JOA) whereby advertising, production, marketing, and circulation were controlled by the &quot;Times&quot; for both papers. The two papers maintained their own identities with separate news and editorial departments.

The &quot;Times&quot; announced its intention to cancel the JOA in 2003, citing a clause in the JOA contract that three consecutive years of losses allowed it to pull out of the agreement. Hearst sued, arguing that a &quot;force majeure clause&quot; prevented the &quot;Times&quot; from claiming losses as reason to end the JOA when they result from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven-week strike by members of the Newspaper Guild). While a district judge ruled in Hearst&#x27;s favor, the &quot;Times&quot; won on appeal, including a unanimous decision from the Washington State Supreme Court on June 30, 2005. Hearst continued to argue that the &quot;Times&quot; fabricated its loss in 2002. The two papers announced an end to their dispute on April 16, 2007.

The JOA was terminated when the &quot;Post-Intelligencer&quot; ceased publication; its final printed edition was March 17, 2009.

==Content==
&quot;The Times&quot; contains different sections every day. Each daily edition includes Main News &amp; Business, a NW section for the day, Sports, and any other sections listed below.

Friday: NW Autos; Weekend Plus

Saturday: NW Homes

Sunday: Business; ShopNW; NW Jobs; NW Arts &amp; Life; NW Traveler; Pacific NW Magazine

&quot;Pacific NW&quot; is a glossy magazine published every week and inserted in the Sunday edition.

==Delivery and page width==

For decades, the broadsheet page width of the &quot;Times&quot; was , printed from a 54-inch web, the four-page width of a roll of newsprint. Following changing industry standards, the width of the page was reduced in 2005 by , to , now a 50-inch web standard. In February 2009, the web size was further reduced to 46 inches, which narrowed the page by another inch to in width.

<doc id="432612" wikidata="Q286261" url="?curid=432612" title="Seattle Post-Intelligencer">
<text>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer (popularly known as the Seattle P-I, the Post-Intelligencer, or simply the P-I) is an online newspaper and former print newspaper based in Seattle, Washington, United States.

The newspaper was founded in 1863 as the weekly Seattle Gazette, and was later published daily in broadsheet format. It was long one of the city&#x27;s two daily newspapers, along with &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, until it became an online-only publication on March 18, 2009.

==History==

J.R. Watson founded the &quot;Seattle Gazette&quot;, Seattle&#x27;s first newspaper, on December 10, 1863. The paper failed after a few years and was renamed the &quot;Weekly Intelligencer&quot; in 1867 by new owner Sam Maxwell.

In 1878, after publishing the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; as a morning daily, printer Thaddeus Hanford bought the &quot;Daily Intelligencer&quot; for $8,000. Hanford also acquired Beriah Brown&#x27;s daily &quot;Puget Sound Dispatch&quot; and the weekly &quot;Pacific Tribune&quot; and folded both papers into the &quot;Intelligencer&quot;. In 1881, the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; merged with the &quot;Seattle Post&quot;. The names were combined to form the present-day name.

In 1886, Indiana businessman Leigh S. J. Hunt came to Seattle and purchased the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, which he owned and published until he was forced to sell in the Panic of 1893. At this point the newspaper was acquired by attorney and real estate developer James D. Hoge under whom it was representative of an establishment viewpoint. It was the state&#x27;s predominant newspaper. Circulation was greatly increased by coverage of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. Hoge, who was involved in other business, sought to find a buyer and sold in 1899. The newspaper was acquired with assistance from James J. Hill by John L. Wilson who had first started the Seattle Klondike Information Bureau. The newspaper was acquired by Hearst in 1921.

Circulation stood at 31,000 in 1911. In 1912, editor Eric W. Allen left the paper to found the University of Oregon School of Journalism, which he ran until his death in 1944.

William Randolph Hearst took over the paper in 1921, and the Hearst Corporation owns the &quot;P-I&quot; to this day.

In 1936, 35 &quot;P-I&quot; writers and members of The Newspaper Guild went on three-month strike against &quot;arbitrary dismissals and assignment changes and other &#x27;efficiency&#x27; moves by the newspaper.&quot; The International Brotherhood of Teamsters joined the strike in solidarity. Roger Simpson and William Ames co-wrote their book &quot;Unionism or Hearst: the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Strike of 1936&quot; on the topic.

Anna Roosevelt Halsted, the daughter of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, began working as the editor of the women&#x27;s page at the &quot;P-I&quot; after her husband Clarence John Boettiger took over as publisher in 1936. Boettiger left Seattle to enter the United States Army in April 1943, while Anna stayed at the paper to help keep a liberal voice in the running of the paper. After Boettiger&#x27;s absence, the paper increasingly turned conservative with Hearst&#x27;s new acting publisher. Anna left Seattle in December 1943 to live in the White House with her youngest child, Johnny. This effectively ended the Roosevelt-Boettiger ties with the &quot;P-I&quot;.

On December 15, 2006, no copies were printed as a result of a power outage caused by the December 2006 Pacific Northwest storms. It was the first time in 70 years that publication had been suspended.

On January 9, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that after losing money on it every year since 2000, Hearst was putting the &quot;P-I&quot; up for sale. The paper would be put on the market for 60 days, and if a buyer could not be found within that time, the paper would either be turned into an Internet-only publication with a drastically reduced staff, or closed outright. The news of the paper&#x27;s impending sale was initially broken by local station KING-TV the night prior to the official announcement, and came as a surprise to the &quot;P-I&quot;″s staff and the owners of rival newspaper &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. Analysts did not expect a buyer to be found, in view of declining circulation in the U.S. newspaper industry and other newspapers on the market going unsold. Five days before the 60-day deadline, the &quot;P-I&quot; reported that the Hearst Corporation had given several &quot;P-I&quot; reporters provisional job offers for an online edition of the &quot;P-I&quot;.

On March 16, 2009, the newspaper posted a headline on its front page, followed shortly after by a short news story, that explained that the following day&#x27;s edition would be its final one in print. The newspaper&#x27;s publisher, Roger Oglesby, was quoted saying that the &quot;P-I&quot; would continue as an online-only operation. Print subscribers had their subscriptions automatically transferred to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; on March 18.

, the &quot;P-I&quot; continues as an online-only newspaper. In September 2010, the site had an estimated 2.8 million unique visitors and 208,000 visitors per day.

==Joint operating agreement==
From 1983 to 2009, the &quot;P-I&quot; and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; had a joint operating agreement (JOA) whereby advertising, production, marketing, and circulation were run for both papers by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; company. They maintained separate news and editorial departments. The papers published a combined Sunday edition, although the &quot;Times&quot; handled the majority of the editorial content while the &quot;P-I&quot; only provided a small editorial/opinions section. The JOA was proposed by Hearst in 1981 due to $14 million in cumulative financial losses incurred by the &quot;P-I&quot;.

In 2003 the &quot;Times&quot; tried to cancel the JOA, citing a clause in it that three consecutive years of losses were cause for cancelling the agreement. Hearst disagreed, and immediately filed suit to prevent the &quot;Times&quot; from cancelling the agreement. Hearst argued that a &quot;force majeure&quot; clause prevented the &quot;Times&quot; from claiming losses in 2000 and 2001 as reason to end the JOA, because they resulted from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven-week newspaper strike).

Each side publicly accused the other of attempting to put its rival out of business. The trial judge granted a summary judgment in Hearst&#x27;s favor on the &quot;force majeure&quot; issue. But after two appeals, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the &quot;Times&quot; on June 30, 2005, on the &quot;force majeure&quot; clause, reversing the trial-court judge. The two papers settled the issue on April 16, 2007.

The JOA ended in 2009 with the cessation of the &quot;P-I&quot; print edition.

==Awards==
The &quot;P-I&quot; was notable for its two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist, David Horsey.

==Notable reports==
===Report on Judge Gary Little===
Investigative reporting on King County Superior Court Judge Gary Little&#x27;s out-of-court contact with juvenile defendants revealed accusations that Little molested young boys while he was a teacher at Seattle&#x27;s exclusive Lakeside School between 1968 and 1971. It also revealed inappropriate contact between Little and juveniles appearing before him after he became a judge. On August 19, 1988, after reporter Duff Wilson called the judge to advise him the newspaper was publishing the story, Little shot himself in the King County Courthouse. The ethical debates surrounding the publication of the storyand the network of connections that protected Littleare taught in journalism classes, and led to reforms in the way judges are disciplined in Washington state.

===Conduct Unbecoming series===
In 2006 the &quot;P-I&quot; became the subject of a complaint to the Washington News Council for its reporting on the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The media watch-dog group ruled against the &quot;P-I&quot;, agreeing with Sheriff Sue Rahr&#x27;s complaint that the newspaper had unfairly disparaged the Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The &quot;P-I&quot; declined to participate in the proceedings, and opted instead to give a detailed reply on its website.

==The P-I Globe==

The &quot;P-I&quot; is known for the 13.5-ton, neon globe atop its headquarters on the Elliott Bay waterfront, which features the words &quot;It&#x27;s in the P-I&quot; rotating around the globe and an eagle perched atop with wings stretched upwards. The globe originated from a 1947 readers&#x27; contest to determine a new symbol for the paper. Out of 350 entrants, the winner was Jack (known as Jakk) C. Corsaw, a University of Washington art student. The globe was manufactured in 1948 and was placed atop the paper&#x27;s then-new headquarters building at 6th Avenue and Wall Street (now City University of Seattle). When the newspaper moved its headquarters again in 1986 to its current location on the waterfront, the globe was relocated to the new building. Over the decades since its first installation, the globe has become a city landmark that, to locals, is as iconic as the Space Needle. A stylized rendering of the globe appeared on the masthead of the newspaper in its latter years and continues to feature on its website.

In April 2012, it was designated a Seattle landmark by the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Board. Mayor Ed Murray signed a city ordinance that had been passed by the Seattle City Council on December 17, 2015, that designated the globe as an official city landmark.

In March 2012, the globe was donated to the Museum of History and Industry, which planned to refurbish and relocate it, but , this had not occurred.

<text>The Seattle Weekly is an alternative biweekly distributed newspaper in Seattle, Washington, United States. It was founded by Darrell Oldham and David Brewster as &quot;The Weekly.&quot; Its first issue was published on March 31, 1976, and it became a web-only publication on March 1, 2019. Since January 2013, it has been owned by Sound Publishing, Inc., a subsidiary of the Canadian company Black Press and the largest community news publisher in Washington State. It is published each Wednesday.

==Ownership history==
Former owners of the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; include Sasquatch Publishing/Quickfish Media, Seattle from 1976 to 1997; Stern Publishing, New York, from 1997 to 2000; Village Voice Media, New York, from 2000 to 2012; and Voice Media Group from September 2012 to January 2013. Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media&#x27;s papers and associated web properties from its founders to form Voice Media Group. Sound Publishing purchased the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; from Voice Media Group in January 2013.

In July 2006, longtime editor-in-chief Knute Berger announced he would be leaving the paper.

Mark Baumgarten, former &quot;City Arts&quot; editor-in-chief and author of &quot;Love Rock Revolution&quot;, became editor-in-chief on March 12, 2013, replacing Mike Seely who resigned January of the same year. In January 2018, Seth Sommerfeld became editor-in-chief and Mark Baumgarten transitioned to editorial director for King County. In June 2018, Andy Hobbs replaced Baumgarten as editorial director, and in August 2018, he became editor-in-chief.

Eric LaFontaine was named publisher in May 2018 and was put in change of all digital and print operations.

On February 25, 2019, Sound Publishing announced that the paper would transition to web-only content in a move similar to the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; a decade earlier. The final print edition was published on February 27, 2019, and the web-only portal was launched two days later.

<doc id="432615" wikidata="Q1366191" url="?curid=432615" title="T-duality">
<text>T-duality (short for target-space duality) in theoretical physics is an equivalence of two physical theories, which may be either quantum field theories or string theories. In the simplest example of this relationship, one of the theories describes strings propagating in a spacetime shaped like a circle of some radius formula_1, while the other theory describes strings propagating on a spacetime shaped like a circle of radius proportional to formula_2. The idea of T-duality was first noted by Bala Sathiapalan in an obscure paper in 1987. The two T-dual theories are equivalent in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, momentum in one description takes discrete values and is equal to the number of times the string winds around the circle in the dual description.

The idea of T-duality can be extended to more complicated theories, including superstring theories. The existence of these dualities implies that seemingly different superstring theories are actually physically equivalent. This led to the realization, in the mid-1990s, that all of the five consistent superstring theories are just different limiting cases of a single eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory.

In general, T-duality relates two theories with different spacetime geometries. In this way, T-duality suggests a possible scenario in which the classical notions of geometry break down in a theory of Planck scale physics. The geometric relationships suggested by T-duality are also important in pure mathematics. Indeed, according to the SYZ conjecture of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow, T-duality is closely related to another duality called mirror symmetry, which has important applications in a branch of mathematics called enumerative algebraic geometry.

==Overview==

===Strings and duality===

T-duality is a particular example of a general notion of duality in physics. The term &quot;duality&quot; refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be &quot;dual&quot; to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.

Like many of the dualities studied in theoretical physics, T-duality was discovered in the context of string theory. In string theory, particles are modeled not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional extended objects called strings. The physics of strings can be studied in various numbers of dimensions. In addition to three familiar dimensions from everyday experience (up/down, left/right, forward/backward), string theories may include one or more compact dimensions which are curled up into circles.

A standard analogy for this is to consider multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions. Such extra dimensions are important in T-duality, which relates a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of some radius formula_1 to a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of radius formula_2.

===Winding numbers===
In mathematics, the winding number of a curve in the plane around a given point is an integer representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point. The notion of winding number is important in the mathematical description of T-duality where it is used to measure the winding of strings around compact extra dimensions.

For example, the image below shows several examples of curves in the plane, illustrated in red. Each curve is assumed to be closed, meaning it has no endpoints, and is allowed to intersect itself. Each curve has an orientation given by the arrows in the picture. In each situation, there is a distinguished point in the plane, illustrated in black. The &quot;winding number&quot; of the curve around this distinguished point is equal to the total number of counterclockwise turns that the curve makes around this point.

When counting the total number of turns, counterclockwise turns count as positive, while clockwise turns counts as negative. For example, if the curve first circles the origin four times counterclockwise, and then circles the origin once clockwise, then the total winding number of the curve is three. According to this scheme, a curve that does not travel around the distinguished point at all has winding number zero, while a curve that travels clockwise around the point has negative winding number. Therefore, the winding number of a curve may be any integer. The pictures above show curves with winding numbers between −2 and 3:

===Quantized momenta===

The simplest theories in which T-duality arises are two-dimensional sigma models with circular target spaces, i.e. compactified free bosons. These are simple quantum field theories that describe propagation of strings in an imaginary spacetime shaped like a circle. The strings can thus be modeled as curves in the plane that are confined to lie in a circle, say of radius formula_1, about the origin. In what follows, the strings are assumed to be closed (that is, without endpoints).

Denote this circle by formula_6. One can think of this circle as a copy of the real line with two points identified if they differ by a multiple of the circle&#x27;s circumference formula_7. It follows that the state of a string at any given time can be represented as a function formula_8 of a single real parameter formula_9. Such a function can be expanded in a Fourier series as

:formula_10.

Here formula_11 denotes the winding number of the string around the circle, and the constant mode formula_12 of the Fourier series has been singled out. Since this expression represents the configuration of a string at a fixed time, all coefficients (formula_13 and the formula_14) are also functions of time.

Let formula_15 denote the time derivative of the constant mode formula_13. This represents a type of momentum in the theory. One can show, using the fact that the strings considered here are closed, that this momentum can only take on discrete values of the form formula_17 for some integer formula_18. In more physical language, one says that the momentum spectrum is &quot;quantized&quot;.

===An equivalence of theories===

In the situation described above, the total energy, or Hamiltonian, of the string is given by the expression

:formula_19.

Since the momenta of the theory are quantized, the first two terms in this formula are formula_20, and this expression is unchanged when one simultaneously replaces the radius formula_1 by formula_2 and exchanges the winding number formula_11 and the integer formula_18. The summation in the expression for formula_25 is similarly unaffected by these changes, so the total energy is unchanged. In fact, this equivalence of Hamiltonians descends to an equivalence of two quantum mechanical theories: One of these theories describes strings propagating on a circle of radius formula_1, while the other describes string propagating in a circle of radius formula_2 with momentum and winding numbers interchanged. This equivalence of theories is the simplest manifestation of T-duality.

==Superstrings==

Up until the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory believed there were five distinct versions of the theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8×E8). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries.

In the mid 1990s, physicists noticed that these five string theories are actually related by highly nontrivial dualities. One of these dualities is T-duality. For example, it was shown that type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality and also that the two versions of heterotic string theory are related by T-duality.

The existence of these dualities showed that the five string theories were in fact not all distinct theories. In 1995, at the string theory conference at University of Southern California, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five of these theories were just different limits of a single theory now known as M-theory. Witten&#x27;s proposal was based on the observation that different superstring theories are linked by dualities and the fact that type IIA and E8×E8 heterotic string theories are closely related to a gravitational theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity. His announcement led to a flurry of work now known as the second superstring revolution.

==Mirror symmetry==


In string theory and algebraic geometry, the term &quot;mirror symmetry&quot; refers to a phenomenon involving complicated shapes called Calabi–Yau manifolds. These manifolds provide an interesting geometry on which strings can propagate, and the resulting theories may have applications in particle physics. In the late 1980s, it was noticed that such a Calabi–Yau manifold does not uniquely determine the physics of the theory. Instead, one finds that there are &quot;two&quot; Calabi–Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics. These manifolds are said to be &quot;mirror&quot; to one another. This mirror duality is an important computational tool in string theory, and it has allowed mathematicians to solve difficult problems in enumerative geometry.

One approach to understanding mirror symmetry is the SYZ conjecture, which was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a complicated Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and considering the effects of T-duality on these pieces.

The simplest example of a Calabi–Yau manifold is a torus (a surface shaped like a donut). Such a surface can be viewed as the product of two circles. This means that the torus can be viewed as the union of a collection of longitudinal circles (such as the red circle in the image). There is an auxiliary space which says how these circles are organized, and this space is itself a circle (the pink circle). This space is said to &quot;parametrize&quot; the longitudinal circles on the torus. In this case, mirror symmetry is equivalent to T-duality acting on the longitudinal circles, changing their radii from formula_1 to formula_29, with formula_30 the inverse of the string tension.

The SYZ conjecture generalizes this idea to the more complicated case of six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifolds like the one illustrated above. As in the case of a torus, one can divide a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces, which in this case are 3-tori (three-dimensional objects which generalize the notion of a torus) parametrized by a 3-sphere (a three-dimensional generalization of a sphere). T-duality can be extended from circles to the three-dimensional tori appearing in this decomposition, and the SYZ conjecture states that mirror symmetry is equivalent to the simultaneous application of T-duality to these three-dimensional tori. In this way, the SYZ conjecture provides a geometric picture of how mirror symmetry acts on a Calabi–Yau manifold.

<doc id="432617" wikidata="Q7789018" url="?curid=432617" title="Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick">
<text>Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick (1634 – 14 December 1715) was an Irish military officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of New York from 1683 to 1688. He called the first representative legislature in the Province of New York and granted the colony&#x27;s first charter of liberties. Dongan&#x27;s negotiations and subsequent alliance with the Iroquois brought a degree of security from attacks by the French and their Indian allies.

==Early life and family==
Dongan was born in 1634 into an old Gaelic Norman (Irish Catholic) family in Castletown Kildrought (now Celbridge), County Kildare, in the Kingdom of Ireland, the seventh and youngest son of Sir John Dongan, 2nd Baronet, Member of the Irish Parliament, and his wife Mary Talbot, daughter of Sir William Talbot, 1st Baronet, and Alison Netterville. Dongan&#x27;s maternal uncles were Peter Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin (1673–1679), and Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, who was lord-deputy of Ireland during the reign of James II. After the beheading of Charles I, Dongan&#x27;s father, a supporter of the House of Stuart, and his family, fled to France, where Thomas obtained a commission in the French Royal Army.

==Career==

While in France, he served in an Irish regiment of the French army under George Hamilton, Comte d&#x27;Hamilton. He stayed in France after the Stuart Restoration and achieved the rank of colonel in 1674.

After the Treaty of Nijmegen ended the Franco-Dutch War in 1678, Dongan returned to England in obedience to the order that recalled all English subjects in French military service. Fellow officer James, Duke of York, arranged to have him granted a high-ranking commission in the English Army force designated for service in Flanders and a pension. That same year, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of English Tangier, which had been granted to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza. He served as part of the Tangier Garrison which defended the settlement.

==Governor of New York==

In September 1682, James, Duke of York, as Lord Proprietor of the Province of New York, appointed Dongan as vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and governor to replace Edmund Andros &quot;Dongan&#x27;s long service in the French army had made him conversant with the French character and diplomacy and his campaigns in the Low Countries had given him a knowledge of the Dutch language.&quot; James also granted him an estate on Staten Island. The estate eventually became the town of Castleton; later, another section of the island was named Dongan Hills in honour of Dongan.

Dongan landed in Boston on 10 August 1683, crossed Long Island Sound, and passed through the small settlements in the eastern part of the island and he made his way to Fort James, arriving on 25 August. In October, Rev. Henry Selyns reported to the Amsterdam Classis, &quot;...our new governor has at last arrived. His excellency is a person of knowledge refinement and modesty. I have had the pleasure of receiving a call from him and I have the privilege of calling on him whenever I desire.&quot;

In 1683, at the time of Dongan&#x27;s appointment the province was bankrupt and in a state of rebellion. Dongan was able to restore order and stability. On October 14 of that year he convened the first-ever representative assembly in New York history at Fort James. The New York General Assembly, under the wise supervision of Dongan, passed an act entitled &quot;Charter of Liberties and Privileges&quot;. It decreed that the supreme legislative power under the Duke of York shall reside in a governor, council, and the people convened in general assembly; conferred upon the members of the assembly rights and privileges making them a body coequal to and independent of the Parliament of England; established town, county, and general courts of justice; solemnly proclaimed the right of religious liberty; and passed acts enunciating certain constitutional liberties, e.g. taxes could be levied only by the people met in general assembly; right of suffrage; and no martial law or quartering of the soldiers without the consent of the inhabitants.

Dongan soon incurred the ill will of William Penn who was negotiating with the Iroquois for the purchase of the upper Susquehanna Valley. Dongan went to Albany, and declared that the sale would be &quot;prejudicial to His Highness&#x27;s interests&quot;. The Cayugas sold the property to New York with the consent of the Mohawk. Years later, when back in England and in favour at the Court of James II, Penn would use his influence to prejudice the king against Dongan.

On 22 July 1686, Governor Dongan granted Albany a municipal charter, now known as the Dongan Charter. Almost identical in form to the charter awarded to New York City just three months earlier, the Albany charter was the result of negotiations conducted between royal officials and Robert Livingston the Elder and Pieter Schuyler. The charter incorporated the city of Albany, establishing a separate municipal entity in the midst of the Van Rensselaer Manor.

Dongan established the boundary lines of the province by settling disputes with Connecticut on the East, with the French Governor of Canada on the North, and with Pennsylvania on the South, thus marking out the present limits of New York State. Regarding Canada, it was necessary to secure the friendship of the Iroquois. This became the subject of a deal of correspondence between Dongan and his counterpart to the north. &quot;...[C]ertainly our rum doth as little hurt as your brandy and in the opinion of Christians is much more wholesome.&quot; Dongan, along with Lord Howard of Effingham, Governor of Virginia, journeyed to the Iroquois nation around Albany in 1684, and convened assembly with them, garnering support, and approval. He was called &quot;corlur&quot; by the Iroquois Chief, a term from the Irish language &quot;Coṁairleoir,&quot; used in Parliamentary deference to the Speaker, and meaning &quot;advisor.&quot;

Dongan established the first post office in New York in 1686 with the objective of promoting better communication between the American colonies. In a 1687 report on the colony to the Committee on Trade in London, he also presciently described its remarkable early religious heterogeneity, which only grew across the centuries: &quot;Here bee not many of the Church of England; few Roman Catholicks; abundance of Quakers preachers men and Women especially; Singing Quakers, Ranting Quakers; Sabbatarians Antisabbatarians; Some Anabaptists, some Independents; some Jews; in short of all sorts of opinions there are some, and the most part of none at all.&quot;

James later consolidated the colonial governments of New York, New Jersey and the United Colonies of New England into the Dominion of New England and appointed Edmund Andros, the former Governor-General of New York, as Governor-General. Dongan transferred his governorship back to Andros on 11 August 1688. He retired to his Staten Island estate, where he remained until July 1689. During Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion, fearing for his safety, he fled back to England.

Dongan was to execute land grants establishing several towns throughout New York State including the eastern Long Island communities of East Hampton and Southampton. These grants, called the &quot;Dongan Patents, &quot;set up Town Trustees as the governing bodies with a mission of managing common land for common good. The Dongan Patents still hold force of law and have been upheld by the US Supreme Court with the Trustees—rather than town boards, city councils or even the State Legislature—still managing much of the common land in the state.

In 1698, his brother William Dongan, 1st Earl of Limerick, died without issue. Because of his service to the Crown as a military officer and as provincial governor, he was granted his brother&#x27;s title in the Peerage of Ireland and a portion of his brother&#x27;s forfeited estates by a special Act of Parliament for his relief. In 1709, Lord Limerick sold his 2,300-acre property at Celbridge to William Conolly.

==Death==
Dongan lived in London for the last years of his life and died a poor man and without direct heirs on 14 December 1715 at the age of 81. In his will, dated 1713, he wished that he be buried with expenses not to exceed £100, and bequeathed the remainder of his estate to his niece, the wife of Colonel Nugent, who later became Marshal of France. He was buried in Old St. Pancras churchyard, London.

==Legacy==
==Notes==
The last name of Dongan was later changed to Dungan to emulate the Irish dialect pronunciation of Dongan which sounds like Dungan. All Dungans today are related to this familial line.

<text>In theoretical physics, S-duality (short for strong–weak duality, or Sen duality) is an equivalence of two physical theories, which may be either quantum field theories or string theories. S-duality is useful for doing calculations in theoretical physics because it relates a theory in which calculations are difficult to a theory in which they are easier.

In quantum field theory, S-duality generalizes a well established fact from classical electrodynamics, namely the invariance of Maxwell&#x27;s equations under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields. One of the earliest known examples of S-duality in quantum field theory is Montonen–Olive duality which relates two versions of a quantum field theory called &quot;N&quot; = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory. Recent work of Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten suggests that Montonen–Olive duality is closely related to a research program in mathematics called the geometric Langlands program. Another realization of S-duality in quantum field theory is Seiberg duality, which relates two versions of a theory called N=1 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory.

There are also many examples of S-duality in string theory. The existence of these string dualities implies that seemingly different formulations of string theory are actually physically equivalent. This led to the realization, in the mid-1990s, that all of the five consistent superstring theories are just different limiting cases of a single eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory.

==Overview==

In quantum field theory and string theory, a coupling constant is a number that controls the strength of interactions in the theory. For example, the strength of gravity is described by a number called Newton&#x27;s constant, which appears in Newton&#x27;s law of gravity and also in the equations of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. Similarly, the strength of the electromagnetic force is described by a coupling constant, which is related to the charge carried by a single proton.

To compute observable quantities in quantum field theory or string theory, physicists typically apply the methods of perturbation theory. In perturbation theory, quantities called probability amplitudes, which determine the probability for various physical processes to occur, are expressed as sums of infinitely many terms, where each term is proportional to a power of the coupling constant formula_1:

: formula_2.

In order for such an expression to make sense, the coupling constant must be less than 1 so that the higher powers of formula_1 become negligibly small and the sum is finite. If the coupling constant is not less than 1, then the terms of this sum will grow larger and larger, and the expression gives a meaningless infinite answer. In this case the theory is said to be &quot;strongly coupled&quot;, and one cannot use perturbation theory to make predictions.

For certain theories, S-duality provides a way of doing computations at strong coupling by translating these computations into different computations in a weakly coupled theory. S-duality is a particular example of a general notion of duality in physics. The term &quot;duality&quot; refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be &quot;dual&quot; to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.

S-duality is useful because it relates a theory with coupling constant formula_1 to an equivalent theory with coupling constant formula_5. Thus it relates a strongly coupled theory (where the coupling constant formula_1 is much greater than 1) to a weakly coupled theory (where the coupling constant formula_5 is much less than 1 and computations are possible). For this reason, S-duality is called a strong-weak duality.

==In quantum field theory==

===A symmetry of Maxwell&#x27;s equations===

In classical physics, the behavior of the electric and magnetic field is described by a system of equations known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Working in the language of vector calculus and assuming that no electric charges or currents are present, these equations can be written

:formula_8

Here formula_9 is a vector (or more precisely a &quot;vector field&quot; whose magnitude and direction may vary from point to point in space) representing the electric field, formula_10 is a vector representing the magnetic field, formula_11 is time, and formula_12 is the speed of light. The other symbols in these equations refer to the divergence and curl, which are concepts from vector calculus.

An important property of these equations is their invariance under the transformation that simultaneously replaces the electric field formula_9 by the magnetic field formula_10 and replaces formula_10 by formula_16:

:formula_17

In other words, given a pair of electric and magnetic fields that solve Maxwell&#x27;s equations, it is possible to describe a new physical setup in which these electric and magnetic fields are essentially interchanged, and the new fields will again give a solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. This situation is the most basic manifestation of S-duality in a field theory.

===Montonen–Olive duality===

In quantum field theory, the electric and magnetic fields are unified into a single entity called the electromagnetic field, and this field is described by a special type of quantum field theory called a gauge theory or Yang–Mills theory. In a gauge theory, the physical fields have a high degree of symmetry which can be understood mathematically using the notion of a Lie group. This Lie group is known as the gauge group. The electromagnetic field is described by a very simple gauge theory corresponding to the abelian gauge group U(1), but there are other gauge theories with more complicated non-abelian gauge groups.

It is natural to ask whether there is an analog in gauge theory of the symmetry interchanging the electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The answer was given in the late 1970s by Claus Montonen and David Olive, building on earlier work of Peter Goddard, Jean Nuyts, and Olive. Their work provides an example of S-duality now known as Montonen–Olive duality. Montonen–Olive duality applies to a very special type of gauge theory called N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, and it says that two such theories may be equivalent in a certain precise sense. If one of the theories has a gauge group formula_18, then the dual theory has gauge group formula_19 where formula_19 denotes the Langlands dual group which is in general different from formula_18.

An important quantity in quantum field theory is complexified coupling constant. This is a complex number defined by the formula

:formula_22

where formula_23 is the theta angle, a quantity appearing in the Lagrangian that defines the theory, and formula_1 is the coupling constant. For example, in the Yang–Mills theory that describes the electromagnetic field, this number formula_1 is simply the elementary charge formula_26 carried by a single proton. In addition to exchanging the gauge groups of the two theories, Montonen–Olive duality transforms a theory with complexified coupling constant formula_27 to a theory with complexified constant formula_28.

===Relation to the Langlands program===

In mathematics, the classical Langlands correspondence is a collection of results and conjectures relating number theory to the branch of mathematics known as representation theory. Formulated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s, the Langlands correspondence is related to important conjectures in number theory such as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, which includes Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem as a special case.

In spite of its importance in number theory, establishing the Langlands correspondence in the number theoretic context has proved extremely difficult. As a result, some mathematicians have worked on a related conjecture known as the geometric Langlands correspondence. This is a geometric reformulation of the classical Langlands correspondence which is obtained by replacing the number fields appearing in the original version by function fields and applying techniques from algebraic geometry.

In a paper from 2007, Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten suggested that the geometric Langlands correspondence can be viewed as a mathematical statement of Montonen–Olive duality. Starting with two Yang–Mills theories related by S-duality, Kapustin and Witten showed that one can construct a pair of quantum field theories in two-dimensional spacetime. By analyzing what this dimensional reduction does to certain physical objects called D-branes, they showed that one can recover the mathematical ingredients of the geometric Langlands correspondence. Their work shows that the Langlands correspondence is closely related to S-duality in quantum field theory, with possible applications in both subjects.

===Seiberg duality===

Another realization of S-duality in quantum field theory is Seiberg duality, first introduced by Nathan Seiberg around 1995. Unlike Montonen–Olive duality, which relates two versions of the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four-dimensional spacetime, Seiberg duality relates less symmetric theories called N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. The two N=1 theories appearing in Seiberg duality are not identical, but they give rise to the same physics at large distances. Like Montonen–Olive duality, Seiberg duality generalizes the symmetry of Maxwell&#x27;s equations that interchanges electric and magnetic fields.

==In string theory==

Up until the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory believed there were five distinct versions of the theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8×E8). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries.

In the mid 1990s, physicists noticed that these five string theories are actually related by highly nontrivial dualities. One of these dualities is S-duality. The existence of S-duality in string theory was first proposed by Ashoke Sen in 1994. It was shown that type IIB string theory with the coupling constant formula_1 is equivalent via S-duality to the same string theory with the coupling constant formula_5. Similarly, type I string theory with the coupling formula_1 is equivalent to the SO(32) heterotic string theory with the coupling constant formula_5.

The existence of these dualities showed that the five string theories were in fact not all distinct theories. In 1995, at the string theory conference at University of Southern California, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five of these theories were just different limits of a single theory now known as M-theory. Witten&#x27;s proposal was based on the observation that type IIA and E8×E8 heterotic string theories are closely related to a gravitational theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity. His announcement led to a flurry of work now known as the second superstring revolution.

<text>The distinction between horror and terror is a standard literary and psychological concept applied especially to Gothic and horror fiction. &quot;Horror&quot; is the feeling of revulsion that usually follows a frightening sight, sound, or otherwise experience. By contrast, &quot;terror&quot; is usually described as the feeling of dread and anticipation that &quot;precedes&quot; the horrifying experience.

Noël Carroll also defined terror as a combination of horror and revulsion.

==Literary Gothic==
The distinction between terror and horror was first characterized by the Gothic writer Ann Radcliffe (1764–1823), horror being more related to being shocked or scared (being horrified) at an awful realization or a deeply unpleasant occurrence, while terror is more related to being anxious or fearful. Radcliffe considered that terror is characterized by &quot;obscurity&quot; or indeterminacy in its treatment of potentially horrible events, something which leads to the sublime. She says in an essay published posthumously in 1826, &#x27;On the Supernatural in Poetry&#x27;, that terror &quot;expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life&quot;. Horror, in contrast, &quot;freezes and nearly annihilates them&quot; with its unambiguous displays of atrocity. She goes on: &quot;I apprehend that neither Shakespeare nor Milton by their fictions, nor Mr Burke by his reasoning, anywhere looked to positive horror as a source of the sublime, though they all agree that terror is a very high one; and where lies the great difference between horror and terror, but in uncertainty and obscurity, that accompany the first, respecting the dreader evil.&quot;

According to Devendra Varma in &quot;The Gothic Flame&quot; (1966):

The difference between Terror and Horror is the difference between awful apprehension and sickening realization: between the smell of death and stumbling against a corpse.

==Horror fiction==

Horror is also a genre of film and fiction that relies on horrifying images or situations to tell stories and prompt reactions or jump scares to put their audiences on edge. In these films the moment of horrifying revelation is usually preceded by a terrifying build up, often using the medium of scary music.

In his non-fiction book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, Stephen King stressed how horror tales normally chart the outbreak of madness/the terrible within an everyday setting. He also elaborated on the twin themes of terror and horror, adding a third element which he referred to as &quot;revulsion&quot;. He describes terror as &quot;the finest element&quot; of the three, and the one he strives hardest to maintain in his own writing. Citing many examples, he defines &quot;terror&quot; as the suspenseful moment in horror before the actual monster is revealed. &quot;Horror,&quot; King writes, is that moment at which one sees the creature/aberration that causes the terror or suspense, a &quot;shock value&quot;. King finally compares &quot;revulsion&quot; with the gag-reflex, a bottom-level, cheap gimmick which he admits he often resorts to in his own fiction if necessary, confessing:
I recognize terror as the finest emotion and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find that I cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if I find that I cannot horrify, I&#x27;ll go for the gross-out. I&#x27;m not proud.
==Psychoanalytic views==
Freud likened the experience of horror to that of the uncanny.

In his wake, Georges Bataille saw horror as akin to ecstasy in its transcendence of the everyday; as opening a way to go beyond rational social consciousness. Julia Kristeva in turn considered horror as evoking experience of the primitive, the infantile, and the demoniacal aspects of unmediated femininity.

==Horror, helplessness and trauma==
The paradox of pleasure experienced through horror films/books can be explained partly as stemming from relief from real-life horror in the experience of horror in play, partly as a safe way to return in adult life to the paralysing feelings of infantile helplessness.

Helplessness is also a factor in the overwhelming experience of real horror in psychological trauma. Playing at re-experiencing the trauma may be a helpful way of overcoming it.

<text>In physics, U-duality (short for unified duality) is a symmetry of string theory or M-theory combining S-duality and T-duality transformations. The term is most often met in the context of the &quot;U-duality (symmetry) group&quot; of M-theory as defined on a particular background space (topological manifold). This is the union of all the S-duality and T-duality available in that topology. The narrow meaning of the word &quot;U-duality&quot; is one of those dualities that can be classified neither as an S-duality, nor as a T-duality - a transformation that exchanges a large geometry of one theory with the strong coupling of another theory, for example.

<text>Daniel Duncan McKenzie, (January 8, 1859 – June 8, 1927) was a Canadian lawyer, judge, and politician.

==Life and career==
Born in Lake Ainslie, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, the son of Duncan and Jessie (McMillan) McKenzie, McKenzie was educated at the Public Schools and at the Sydney Academy. He became a barrister and attorney-at-law, practicing in North Sydney, Nova Scotia. He served was Commissioner of
Schools for Cape Breton and was elected ten times to the Municipal Council of North Sydney, serving as Mayor for five years. He was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1900 as a Liberal, and again at the general elections of 1901.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of North Cape Breton and Victoria in the 1904 federal election. A Liberal, he resigned in 1906 when he was appointed a Judge of District No. 7, County Court of Nova Scotia. He retired in 1908 and was re-elected in the 1908 federal election. He was re-elected in 1911, 1917, and 1921.

He became interim leader of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1919, following the death of former Canadian Prime minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier on February 17, 1919. He held that position, and consequently the position of Leader of the Opposition, until August 7 of the same year, when the leadership of the party was won by Mackenzie King at the first Liberal leadership convention. McKenzie was also a candidate at that convention, placing fourth. He later served as Solicitor General during King&#x27;s first term in office.

In 1923, he resigned his seat in the House of Commons after he was named a puisne judge in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. McKenzie served on the bench until his death at the age of 68 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<doc id="432630" wikidata="Q6501705" url="?curid=432630" title="Superspace">
<text>Superspace is the coordinate space of a theory exhibiting supersymmetry. In such a formulation, along with ordinary space dimensions &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, ..., there are also &quot;anticommuting&quot; dimensions whose coordinates are labeled in Grassmann numbers rather than real numbers. The ordinary space dimensions correspond to bosonic degrees of freedom, the anticommuting dimensions to fermionic degrees of freedom.

The word &quot;superspace&quot; was first used by John Wheeler in an unrelated sense to describe the configuration space of general relativity; for example, this usage may be seen in his 1973 textbook &quot;Gravitation&quot;.

==Informal discussion==
There are several similar, but not equivalent, definitions of superspace that have been used, and continue to be used in the mathematical and physics literature. One such usage is as a synonym for super Minkowski space. In this case, one takes ordinary Minkowski space, and extends it with anti-commuting fermionic degrees of freedom, taken to be anti-commuting Weyl spinors from the Clifford algebra associated to the Lorentz group. Equivalently, the super Minkowski space can be understood as the quotient of the super Poincaré algebra modulo the algebra of the Lorentz group. A typical notation for the coordinates on such a space is formula_1 with the overline being the give-away that super Minkowski space is the intended space.

Superspace is also commonly used as a synonym for the super vector space. This is taken to be an ordinary vector space, together with additional coordinates taken from the Grassmann algebra, i.e. coordinate directions that are Grassmann numbers. There are several conventions for constructing a super vector space in use; two of these are described by Rogers and DeWitt.

A third usage of the term &quot;superspace&quot; is as a synonym for a supermanifold: a supersymmetric generalization of a manifold. Note that both super Minkowski spaces and super vector spaces can be taken as special cases of supermanifolds.

A fourth, and completely unrelated meaning saw a brief usage in general relativity; this is discussed in greater detail at the bottom.

==Examples==
Several examples are given below. The first few assume a definition of superspace as a super vector space. This is denoted as R&quot;m&quot;|&quot;n&quot;, the Z2-graded vector space with R&quot;m&quot; as the even subspace and R&quot;n&quot; as the odd subspace. The same definition applies to Cm|n.

The four-dimensional examples take superspace to be super Minkowski space. Although similar to a vector space, this has many important differences: First of all, it is an affine space, having no special point denoting the origin. Next, the fermionic coordinates are taken to be anti-commuting Weyl spinors from the Clifford algebra, rather than being Grassmann numbers. The difference here is that the Clifford algebra has a considerably richer and more subtle structure than the Grassmann numbers. So, the Grassmann numbers are elements of the exterior algebra, and the Clifford algebra has an isomorphism to the exterior algebra, but its relation to the orthogonal group and the spin group, used to construct the spin representations, give it a deep geometric significance. (For example, the spin groups form a normal part of the study of Riemannian geometry, quite outside the ordinary bounds and concerns of physics.)

===Trivial examples===

The smallest superspace is a point which contains neither bosonic nor fermionic directions. Other trivial examples include the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real plane Rn, which is a vector space extending in &quot;n&quot; real, bosonic directions and no fermionic directions. The vector space R0|n, which is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real Grassmann algebra. The space R1|1 of one even and one odd direction is known as the space of dual numbers, introduced by William Clifford in 1873.

===The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics===
Supersymmetric quantum mechanics with &quot;N&quot; supercharges is often formulated in the superspace R1|2&quot;N&quot;, which contains one real direction &quot;t&quot; identified with time and &quot;N&quot; complex Grassmann directions which are spanned by Θ&quot;i&quot; and Θ*&quot;i&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; runs from 1 to &quot;N&quot;.

Consider the special case &quot;N&quot; = 1. The superspace R1|2 is a 3-dimensional vector space. A given coordinate therefore may be written as a triple (&quot;t&quot;, Θ, Θ*). The coordinates form a Lie superalgebra, in which the gradation degree of &quot;t&quot; is even and that of Θ and Θ* is odd. This means that a bracket may be defined between any two elements of this vector space, and that this bracket reduces to the commutator on two even coordinates and on one even and one odd coordinate while it is an anticommutator on two odd coordinates. This superspace is an abelian Lie superalgebra, which means that all of the aforementioned brackets vanish

:::formula_2

where formula_3 is the commutator of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and formula_4 is the anticommutator of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

One may define functions from this vector space to itself, which are called superfields. The above algebraic relations imply that, if we expand our superfield as a power series in Θ and Θ*, then we will only find terms at the zeroeth and first orders, because Θ2 = Θ*2 = 0. Therefore, superfields may be written as arbitrary functions of &quot;t&quot; multiplied by the zeroeth and first order terms in the two Grassmann coordinates

:::formula_5

Superfields, which are representations of the supersymmetry of superspace, generalize the notion of tensors, which are representations of the rotation group of a bosonic space.

One may then define derivatives in the Grassmann directions, which take the first order term in the expansion of a superfield to the zeroeth order term and annihilate the zeroeth order term. One can choose sign conventions such that the derivatives satisfy the anticommutation relations

:::formula_6

These derivatives may be assembled into supercharges

:::formula_7

whose anticommutators identify them as the fermionic generators of a supersymmetry algebra

:::formula_8

where &quot;i&quot; times the time derivative is the Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics. Both &quot;Q&quot; and its adjoint anticommute with themselves. The supersymmetry variation with supersymmetry parameter ε of a superfield Φ is defined to be

:::formula_9

We can evaluate this variation using the action of &quot;Q&quot; on the superfields

:::formula_10

Similarly one may define covariant derivatives on superspace

:::formula_11

which anticommute with the supercharges and satisfy a wrong sign supersymmetry algebra

:::formula_12.

The fact that the covariant derivatives anticommute with the supercharges means the supersymmetry transformation of a covariant derivative of a superfield is equal to the covariant derivative of the same supersymmetry transformation of the same superfield. Thus, generalizing the covariant derivative in bosonic geometry which constructs tensors from tensors, the superspace covariant derivative constructs superfields from superfields.

===Supersymmetric extensions of Minkowski space===
==== N = 1 super Minkowski space ====

Perhaps the most studied concrete superspace in physics is formula_13 super Minkowski space formula_14 or sometimes written formula_15, which is the direct sum of four real bosonic dimensions and four real Grassmann dimensions (also known as fermionic dimensions or spin dimensions).

In supersymmetric quantum field theories one is interested in superspaces which furnish representations of a Lie superalgebra called a supersymmetry algebra. The bosonic part of the supersymmetry algebra is the Poincaré algebra, while the fermionic part is constructed using spinors with Grassmann number valued components.

For this reason, in physical applications one considers an action of the supersymmetry algebra on the four fermionic directions of formula_14 such that they transform as a spinor under the Poincaré subalgebra. In four dimensions there are three distinct irreducible 4-component spinors. There is the Majorana spinor, the left-handed Weyl spinor and the right-handed Weyl spinor. The CPT theorem implies that in a unitary, Poincaré invariant theory, which is a theory in which the S-matrix is a unitary matrix and the same Poincaré generators act on the asymptotic in-states as on the asymptotic out-states, the supersymmetry algebra must contain an equal number of left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors. However, since each Weyl spinor has four components, this means that if one includes any Weyl spinors one must have 8 fermionic directions. Such a theory is said to have extended supersymmetry, and such models have received a lot of attention. For example, supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges and fundamental matter have been solved by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten, see Seiberg–Witten gauge theory. However, in this subsection we are considering the superspace with four fermionic components and so no Weyl spinors are consistent with the CPT theorem.

&quot;Note&quot;: There are many sign conventions in use and this is only one of them.

Therefore, the four fermionic directions transform as a Majorana spinor formula_17. We can also form a conjugate spinor

:::formula_18

where formula_19 is the charge conjugation matrix, which is defined by the property that when it conjugates a gamma matrix, the gamma matrix is negated and transposed. The first equality is the definition of formula_20 while the second is a consequence of the Majorana spinor condition formula_21. The conjugate spinor plays a role similar to that of formula_22 in the superspace formula_23, except that the Majorana condition, as manifested in the above equation, imposes that formula_24 and formula_22 are not independent.

In particular we may construct the supercharges

:::formula_26

which satisfy the supersymmetry algebra

:::formula_27

where formula_28 is the 4-momentum operator. Again the covariant derivative is defined like the supercharge but with the second term negated and it anticommutes with the supercharges. Thus the covariant derivative of a supermultiplet is another supermultiplet.

==== Extended supersymmetry ====

It is possible to have formula_29 sets of supercharges formula_30 with formula_31, although this is not possible for all values of formula_29.

These supercharges generate translations in a total of formula_33 spin dimensions, hence forming the superspace formula_34.

==In general relativity==
The word &quot;superspace&quot; is also used in a completely different and unrelated sense, in the book Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler. There, it refers to the configuration space of general relativity, and, in particular, the view of gravitation as geometrodynamics, an interpretation of general relativity as a form of dynamical geometry. In modern terms, this particular idea of &quot;superspace&quot; is captured in one of several different formalisms used in solving the Einstein equations in a variety of settings, both theoretical and practical, such as in numerical simulations. This includes primarily the ADM formalism, as well as ideas surrounding the Hamilton–Jacobi–Einstein equation and the Wheeler–DeWitt equation.

<text>In theoretical physics, supergravity (supergravity theory; SUGRA for short) is a modern field theory that combines the principles of supersymmetry and general relativity; this is in contrast to non-gravitational supersymmetric theories such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Supergravity is the gauge theory of local supersymmetry. Since the supersymmetry (SUSY) generators form together with the Poincaré algebra and superalgebra, called the super-Poincaré algebra, supersymmetry as a gauge theory makes gravity arise in a natural way.

==Gravitons==

Like all covariant approaches to quantum gravity, supergravity contains a spin-2 field whose quantum is the graviton. Supersymmetry requires the graviton field to have a superpartner. This field has spin 3/2 and its quantum is the gravitino. The number of gravitino fields is equal to the number of supersymmetries.

==History==

===Gauge supersymmetry===
The first theory of local supersymmetry was proposed by Dick Arnowitt and Pran Nath in 1975 and was called gauge supersymmetry.

===Supergravity===
The first model of 4-dimensional supergravity (without this denotation) was formulated by Dmitri Vasilievich Volkov and Vyacheslav A. Soroka in 1973, emphasizing the importance of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking for the possibility of a realistic model. The minimal version of 4-dimensional supergravity (with unbroken local supersymmetry) was constructed in detail in 1976 by Dan Freedman, Sergio Ferrara and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen. In 2019 the three were awarded a special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the discovery. The key issue of whether or not the spin 3/2 field is consistently coupled was resolved in the nearly simultaneous paper, by Deser and Zumino, which independently proposed the minimal 4-dimensional model. It was quickly generalized to many different theories in various numbers of dimensions and involving additional (N) supersymmetries. Supergravity theories with N&gt;1 are usually referred to as extended supergravity (SUEGRA). Some supergravity theories were shown to be related to certain higher-dimensional supergravity theories via dimensional reduction (e.g. N=1, 11-dimensional supergravity is dimensionally reduced on T7 to 4-dimensional, ungauged, &quot;N&quot; = 8 supergravity). The resulting theories were sometimes referred to as Kaluza–Klein theories as Kaluza and Klein constructed in 1919 a 5-dimensional gravitational theory, that when dimensionally reduced on a circle, its 4-dimensional non-massive modes describe electromagnetism coupled to gravity.

===mSUGRA===
mSUGRA means minimal SUper GRAvity. The construction of a realistic model of particle interactions within the &quot;N&quot; = 1 supergravity framework where supersymmetry (SUSY) breaks by a super Higgs mechanism carried out by Ali Chamseddine, Richard Arnowitt and Pran Nath in 1982. Collectively now known as minimal supergravity Grand Unification Theories (mSUGRA GUT), gravity mediates the breaking of SUSY through the existence of a hidden sector. mSUGRA naturally generates the Soft SUSY breaking terms which are a consequence of the Super Higgs effect. Radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry through Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) follows as an immediate consequence. 
Due to its predictive power, requiring only four input parameters and a sign to determine the low energy phenomenology from the scale of Grand Unification, its interest is a widely investigated model of particle physics
===11D: the maximal SUGRA===
One of these supergravities, the 11-dimensional theory, generated considerable excitement as the first potential candidate for the theory of everything. This excitement was built on four pillars, two of which have now been largely discredited:

* Werner Nahm showed 11 dimensions as the largest number of dimensions consistent with a single graviton, and more dimensions will show particles with spins greater than 2. However, if two of these dimensions are time-like, these problems are avoided in 12 dimensions. Itzhak Bars gives this emphasis.
* In 1981 Ed Witten showed 11 as the smallest number of dimensions big enough to contain the gauge groups of the Standard Model, namely SU(3) for the strong interactions and SU(2) times U(1) for the electroweak interactions. Many techniques exist to embed the standard model gauge group in supergravity in any number of dimensions like the obligatory gauge symmetry in type I and heterotic string theories, and obtained in type II string theory by compactification on certain Calabi–Yau manifolds. The D-branes engineer gauge symmetries too.
* In 1978 Eugène Cremmer, Bernard Julia and Joël Scherk (CJS) found the classical action for an 11-dimensional supergravity theory. This remains today the only known classical 11-dimensional theory with local supersymmetry and no fields of spin higher than two. Other 11-dimensional theories known and quantum-mechanically inequivalent reduce to the CJS theory when one imposes the classical equations of motion. However, in the mid-1980s Bernard de Wit and Hermann Nicolai found an alternate theory in D=11 Supergravity with Local SU(8) Invariance. While not manifestly Lorentz-invariant, it is in many ways superior, because it dimensionally-reduces to the 4-dimensional theory without recourse to the classical equations of motion.

* In 1980 Peter Freund and M. A. Rubin showed that compactification from 11 dimensions preserving all the SUSY generators could occur in two ways, leaving only 4 or 7 macroscopic dimensions, the others compact. The noncompact dimensions have to form an anti-de Sitter space. There are many possible compactifications, but the Freund-Rubin compactification&#x27;s invariance under all of the supersymmetry transformations preserves the action.

Finally, the first two results each appeared to establish 11 dimensions, the third result appeared to specify the theory, and the last result explained why the observed universe appears to be four-dimensional.

Many of the details of the theory were fleshed out by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, Sergio Ferrara and Daniel Z. Freedman.

===The end of the SUGRA era===
The initial excitement over 11-dimensional supergravity soon waned, as various failings were discovered, and attempts to repair the model failed as well. Problems included:

* The compact manifolds which were known at the time and which contained the standard model were not compatible with supersymmetry, and could not hold quarks or leptons. One suggestion was to replace the compact dimensions with the 7-sphere, with the symmetry group SO(8), or the squashed 7-sphere, with symmetry group SO(5) times SU(2).
* Until recently, the physical neutrinos seen in experiments were believed to be massless, and appeared to be left-handed, a phenomenon referred to as the chirality of the Standard Model. It was very difficult to construct a chiral fermion from a compactification — the compactified manifold needed to have singularities, but physics near singularities did not begin to be understood until the advent of orbifold conformal field theories in the late 1980s.
* Supergravity models generically result in an unrealistically large cosmological constant in four dimensions, and that constant is difficult to remove, and so require fine-tuning. This is still a problem today.
* Quantization of the theory led to quantum field theory gauge anomalies rendering the theory inconsistent. In the intervening years physicists have learned how to cancel these anomalies.

Some of these difficulties could be avoided by moving to a 10-dimensional theory involving superstrings. However, by moving to 10 dimensions one loses the sense of uniqueness of the 11-dimensional theory.

The core breakthrough for the 10-dimensional theory, known as the first superstring revolution, was a demonstration by Michael B. Green, John H. Schwarz and David Gross that there are only three supergravity models in 10 dimensions which have gauge symmetries and in which all of the gauge and gravitational anomalies cancel. These were theories built on the groups SO(32) and formula_1, the direct product of two copies of E8. Today we know that, using D-branes for example, gauge symmetries can be introduced in other 10-dimensional theories as well.

===The second superstring revolution===
Initial excitement about the 10-dimensional theories, and the string theories that provide their quantum completion, died by the end of the 1980s. There were too many Calabi–Yaus to compactify on, many more than Yau had estimated, as he admitted in December 2005 at the 23rd International Solvay Conference in Physics. None quite gave the standard model, but it seemed as though one could get close with enough effort in many distinct ways. Plus no one understood the theory beyond the regime of applicability of string perturbation theory.

There was a comparatively quiet period at the beginning of the 1990s; however, several important tools were developed. For example, it became apparent that the various superstring theories were related by &quot;string dualities&quot;, some of which relate weak string-coupling - perturbative - physics in one model with strong string-coupling - non-perturbative - in another.

Then the second superstring revolution occurred. Joseph Polchinski realized that obscure string theory objects, called D-branes, which he discovered six years earlier, equate to stringy versions of the p-branes known in supergravity theories. String theory perturbation didn&#x27;t restrict these p-branes. Thanks to supersymmetry, p-branes in supergravity gained understanding well beyond the limits of string theory.

Armed with this new nonperturbative tool, Edward Witten and many others could show all of the perturbative string theories as descriptions of different states in a single theory that Witten named M-theory. Furthermore, he argued that M-theory&#x27;s long wavelength limit, i.e. when the quantum wavelength associated to objects in the theory appear much larger than the size of the 11th dimension, needs 11-dimensional supergravity descriptors that fell out of favor with the first superstring revolution 10 years earlier, accompanied by the 2- and 5-branes.

Therefore, supergravity comes full circle and uses a common framework in understanding features of string theories, M-theory, and their compactifications to lower spacetime dimensions.

==Relation to superstrings==
The term &quot;low energy limits&quot; labels some 10-dimensional supergravity theories. These arise as the massless, tree-level approximation of string theories. True effective field theories of string theories, rather than truncations, are rarely available. Due to string dualities, the conjectured 11-dimensional M-theory is required to have 11-dimensional supergravity as a &quot;low energy limit&quot;. However, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that string theory/M-theory is the only possible UV completion of supergravity; supergravity research is useful independent of those relations.

== 4D &quot;N&quot; = 1 SUGRA ==
Before we move on to SUGRA proper, let&#x27;s recapitulate some important details about general relativity. We have a 4D differentiable manifold M with a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over it. This principal bundle represents the local Lorentz symmetry. In addition, we have a vector bundle T over the manifold with the fiber having four real dimensions and transforming as a vector under Spin(3,1).
We have an invertible linear map from the tangent bundle TM to T. This map is the vierbein. The local Lorentz symmetry has a gauge connection associated with it, the spin connection.

The following discussion will be in superspace notation, as opposed to the component notation, which isn&#x27;t manifestly covariant under SUSY. There are actually &quot;many&quot; different versions of SUGRA out there which are inequivalent in the sense that their actions and constraints upon the torsion tensor are different, but ultimately equivalent in that we can always perform a field redefinition of the supervierbeins and spin connection to get from one version to another.

In 4D N=1 SUGRA, we have a 4|4 real differentiable supermanifold M, i.e. we have 4 real bosonic dimensions and 4 real fermionic dimensions. As in the nonsupersymmetric case, we have a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over M. We have an R4|4 vector bundle T over M. The fiber of T transforms under the local Lorentz group as follows; the four real bosonic dimensions transform as a vector and the four real fermionic dimensions transform as a Majorana spinor. This Majorana spinor can be reexpressed as a complex left-handed Weyl spinor and its complex conjugate right-handed Weyl spinor (they&#x27;re not independent of each other). We also have a spin connection as before.

We will use the following conventions; the spatial (both bosonic and fermionic) indices will be indicated by M, N, ... . The bosonic spatial indices will be indicated by μ, ν, ..., the left-handed Weyl spatial indices by α, β..., and the right-handed Weyl spatial indices by formula_2, formula_3, ... . The indices for the fiber of T will follow a similar notation, except that they will be hatted like this: formula_4. See van der Waerden notation for more details. formula_5. The supervierbein is denoted by formula_6, and the spin connection by formula_7. The &quot;inverse&quot; supervierbein is denoted by formula_8.

The supervierbein and spin connection are real in the sense that they satisfy the reality conditions
:formula_9 where formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12 and formula_13.

The covariant derivative is defined as
:formula_14.

The covariant exterior derivative as defined over supermanifolds needs to be super graded. This means that every time we interchange two fermionic indices, we pick up a +1 sign factor, instead of -1.

The presence or absence of R symmetries is optional, but if R-symmetry exists, the integrand over the full superspace has to have an R-charge of 0 and the integrand over chiral superspace has to have an R-charge of 2.

A chiral superfield &quot;X&quot; is a superfield which satisfies formula_15. In order for this constraint to be consistent, we require the integrability conditions that formula_16 for some coefficients &quot;c&quot;.

Unlike nonSUSY GR, the torsion has to be nonzero, at least with respect to the fermionic directions. Already, even in flat superspace, formula_17.
In one version of SUGRA (but certainly not the only one), we have the following constraints upon the torsion tensor:
:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22
:formula_23
Here, formula_24 is a shorthand notation to mean the index runs over either the left or right Weyl spinors.

The superdeterminant of the supervierbein, formula_25, gives us the volume factor for M. Equivalently, we have the volume 4|4-superformformula_26.

If we complexify the superdiffeomorphisms, there is a gauge where formula_27, formula_28 and formula_29. The resulting chiral superspace has the coordinates x and Θ.

&quot;R&quot; is a scalar valued chiral superfield derivable from the supervielbeins and spin connection. If &quot;f&quot; is any superfield, formula_30 is always a chiral superfield.

The action for a SUGRA theory with chiral superfields &quot;X&quot;, is given by
:formula_31
where &quot;K&quot; is the Kähler potential and &quot;W&quot; is the superpotential, and formula_32 is the chiral volume factor.

Unlike the case for flat superspace, adding a constant to either the Kähler or superpotential is now physical. A constant shift to the Kähler potential changes the effective Planck constant, while a constant shift to the superpotential changes the effective cosmological constant. As the effective Planck constant now depends upon the value of the chiral superfield &quot;X&quot;, we need to rescale the supervierbeins (a field redefinition) to get a constant Planck constant. This is called the Einstein frame.

== &quot;N&quot; = 8 supergravity in 4 dimensions ==
&quot;N&quot; = 8 supergravity is the most symmetric quantum field theory which involves gravity and a finite number of fields. It can be found from a dimensional reduction of 11D supergravity by making the size of 7 of the dimensions go to zero. It has 8 supersymmetries which is the most any gravitational theory can have since there are 8 half-steps between spin 2 and spin −2. (A graviton has the highest spin in this theory which is a spin 2 particle.) More supersymmetries would mean the particles would have superpartners with spins higher than 2. The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as string theory and higher-spin theories). Stephen Hawking in his &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; speculated that this theory could be the Theory of Everything. However, in later years this was abandoned in favour of string theory. There has been renewed interest in the 21st century with the possibility that this theory may be finite.

== Higher-dimensional SUGRA ==

Higher-dimensional SUGRA is the higher-dimensional, supersymmetric generalization of general relativity. Supergravity can be formulated in any number of dimensions up to eleven. Higher-dimensional SUGRA focuses upon supergravity in greater than four dimensions.

The number of supercharges in a spinor depends on the dimension and the signature of spacetime. The supercharges occur in spinors. Thus the limit on the number of supercharges cannot be satisfied in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Some theoretical examples in which this is satisfied are:

* 12-dimensional two-time theory
* 11-dimensional maximal supergravity
* 10-dimensional supergravity theories
** Type IIA supergravity: N = (1, 1)
** Type IIB supergravity: N = (2, 0)
** Type I supergravity: N = (1, 0)
* 9d supergravity theories
** Maximal 9d supergravity from 10d
** T-duality
** N = 1 Gauged supergravity 

The supergravity theories that have attracted the most interest contain no spins higher than two. This means, in particular, that they do not contain any fields that transform as symmetric tensors of rank higher than two under Lorentz transformations. The consistency of interacting higher spin field theories is, however, presently a field of very active interest.

<doc id="432636" wikidata="Q16204122" url="?curid=432636" title="Ogoni Nine">
<text>The Ogoni Nine were a group of nine activists from the Ogoni region of Nigeria who opposed the operating practices of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation in the Niger Delta region. The military government in Nigeria was threatened by their work and arrested them for murders of four Ogoni chiefs. Social activist and head of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ken Saro-Wiwa, alongside eight of his fellow leaders—Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine—were put on trial under the false pretext that the group had incited the murder of four Ogoni chiefs.

In 1990, in response to the continued violations against the Ogoni people by the oil industry and the Nigerian state, Ken Saro-Wiwa founded the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). This movement consisted of over seven hundred thousand Ogoni people, all campaigning for social, economic, and environmental justice through nonviolent resistance and protest. Ogoniland, the name of the traditional homeland of the Ogoni people, was devastated by oil spills. These oil spills made the land uninhabitable in some areas, and unable to be farmed, a common livelihood of the Ogoni people.

MOSOP published the Ogoni Bill of Rights, which aimed to realize political and economic autonomy for the Ogoni people and protect Ogoniland from further environmental degradation. The bill called on international governments and development institutions to stand in solidarity with the Ogoni people and protect activists from political persecution by Nigeria&#x27;s federal government.

Ken Saro-Wiwa had previously been a critic of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation, and had been imprisoned for a year. According to Amnesty International, “in May of 1994, [the] Ogoni chiefs known to be opponents of MOSOP were murdered. Without presenting any evidence, the government blamed MOSOP and arrested..people, including Ken Saro-Wiwa and Barinem Kiobel. Kiobel…had a senior government position and had been critical of the military’s actions in Ogoniland.” The trial was widely discredited, with critics worldwide speaking out against the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha, who was then in power. Despite that, the Nine were found guilty, and on the morning of November 10, 1995, they were executed by hanging. They were buried in Port Harcourt Cemetery. Traditional Ogoni burial practices prohibited. According to Lazarus Baribiae Saale of the Niger Delta University, “wake-keep and all-important rites given to heroes in the Ogoni tradition were not allowed by the Military Government. Ogoni land during this period was militarized and those who wore black clothes were arrested for mourning these activists.”

The executions provoked international condemnation and led to the increasing treatment of Nigeria as a pariah state until General Abacha&#x27;s mysterious death in 1998.

At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell&#x27;s lawyer.

== Ken Saro Wiwa ==
Ken Saro-Wiwa was an influential teacher, government leader, writer, actor, and most famously an activist for the Ogoni people. During the Nigerian civil war he supported the federal government, and served as an Ogoni leader. He resigned from his governmental position when he felt that dictator Ibrahim Babangida was disingenuous about his work to restore Nigeria to a democracy.

Saro-Wiwa  served as one of the early members of the MOSOP, vice chairman of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO). His work with the MOSOP began in 1990, primarily working on environmental protection for Ogoniland. He also helped write the Ogoni Bill of Rights, demanding protection and justice for the Ogoni people and their land. Ken Saro-Wiwa promoted peaceful protests, and he worked to find solutions through the MOSOP and UNPO in nonviolent ways.

== The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People and Lead-Up to Execution ==
The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) was founded in 1990, as a non-governmental, non-political organization run by the Ogoni people. Their main goal was to promote democratic awareness in Nigeria, and to protect the environment of the Ogoni people. This was done through non-violent campaigns and protests. Additionally, the MOSOP wrote the Ogoni Bill of Rights, demanding changes be made within the Nigerian government for the self determination of the Ogoni people.

The MOSOP is known for protesting against the Royal Dutch Shell involvement in Nigeria and oil spills in Ogoniland. The group sought international cooperation, including from the United Nations (UN), led by Ken Saro-Wiwa. By 1992 the MOSOP was primarily working against the oil industry in Nigeria.

Starting in 1938, Royal Dutch Shell started relations with the Nigerian government, and the first oil was extracted in 1958. For several years after, the Nigerian government became closer with Shell, and in 1979 The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria was established. The first documented oil spill occurred in 1970 in Nigeria within the Boobanabe community.

Over the years, while Shell had been extracting oil in Nigeria, there were several spills that have yet to be cleaned up. This upset Nigerian citizens, who wanted their government to put pressures on Shell to clean up the spills. Specifically, the Ogoni people were concerned about the environmental degradation, and they created the MOSOP to put pressures on the government.

In the early 90s there were numerous protests and in 1993, Shell suspended production in Ogoniland for a short period of time. On January 4, 1993, 300,000 people protested peacefully against oil production in Ogoniland. During MOSOP’s 1993 protest, an Ogoni leader explained, “We have woken up to find our lands devastated by agents of death called oil companies. Our atmosphere has been totally polluted, our lands degraded, our waters contaminated, our trees poisoned, so much so that our flora and fauna have virtually disappeared”. This day is now recognized as Ogoni Day.

In April of 1993, MOSOP leader Ken Saro-Wiwa had already been arrested twice, and the MOSOP protests were becoming violent as Shell called in government troops to put people to rest. The MOSOP continued to face increasing violence, primarily from the military during 1993 and 1994. In May of 1994, four Ogoni chiefs were murdered, and the government took to arresting dozens of MOSOP members, including the Ogoni Nine.

Later that same year, Shell requested military support in order to build a pipeline through Ogoniland. The MOSOP continued to protest Shell’s business in Nigeria and oppose their work. Since the execution of the Ogoni Nine, throughout the early 2000s, there have been numerous spills and extraction-related fires throughout Nigeria.

== Ogoni Bill of Rights ==
The Ogoni Bill of Rights was presented to the Nigerian government and the people of Nigeria in October 1990. It was also intended for the international community to read and understand. The bill was written by the MOSOP, with direct work by Ken Saro-Wiwa. In August of 1990 the Chiefs and Ogoni people met to sign the bill of rights, claiming their independence from the British, while also recognizing loyalty to Nigeria. Additionally, the bill called for political control by Ogoni people over Ogoniland. One important aspect was to have Ogoni people control economic resources on their land, protect their own environment from further degradation, and include direct representation of Ogoni people in Nigerian government. The bill included that these rights should have been turned over to the Ogoni people after British rule ceased 30 years ago, but according to Ken Saro Wiwa these rights “have been misused and abused, turning Nigeria into a hell on earth for the Ogoni and similar ethnic minorities.”

According to MOSOP’s first president, Dr. Garrick B Leton the Ogoni people were experiencing a genocide, “by multi-national oil companies under the supervision of the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is that of a distinct ethnic minority in Nigeria who feel so suffocated by existing political, economic and social conditions in Nigeria that they have no choice but to cry out to the international community for salvation.” He explained further that 100 billion dollars of oil has been exported from Ogoniland, but all the Ogoni people saw was “no pipe-borne water, no electricity, very few roads, ill-equipped schools and hospitals and no industry whatsoever.” Environmental degradation was also an essential topic in the bill, including how streams and rivers are polluted, gas flares burn constantly, and various issues with acid rain and oil spills. This in turn forced the Ogoni people to outsource and buy food, instead of farming it themselves like they once did.

The bill includes a list of 20 rights presented to the government and Nigerian people, as well as an addendum and a call to action for the international community.

== Trial ==
The Nigerian government arrested the Ogoni Nine, blaming them for the murders of four Ogoni Chiefs. Starting on May 21, 1994 four Ogoni Chiefs were murdered, Albert Badey, Edward Kobani, Samuel Orage and Theophilus Orage, were killed in Gokana. R. Boele, Ogoni. Ken Saro-Wiwa and the rest of the nine were arrested, although Saro-Wiwa was not anywhere near the murder scene at the time. Amnesty International issued a statement that Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s arrest was &quot;part of the continuing suppression by the Nigerian authorities of the Ogoni people&#x27;s campaign against the oil companies&quot;. Over the next several months Ogoni people were arrested, tortured, beaten, and villages destroyed and looted. Ken Saro-Wiwa was subjected to a three day interrogation, by state intelligence on June 28, 1994. Finally, a court hearing was scheduled on June 28, at the High Court in Port Harcourt, however the defendants were prohibited from attending, and the hearing did not take place. On July 11 a second court hearing was scheduled, and again Saro-Wiwa and his fellow defendants were not allowed to attend. On July 18th, a third hearing was scheduled but canceled soon after.

After months in prison, a three member Tribunal was set on November 4, 1994. It included a military officer, and on the November 21 the three members were sworn in. The Attorney General stated that the tribunal would commence on January 16, enforcing a trial date before there was evidence to show that these men were guilty in any form. On the 16 of January the Tribunal was postponed. On January 28 the Ogoni Nine were charged with a holding charge of the murder of the Ogoni chiefs, after 8 months in jail. An additional 18 other Ogoni members who were held in jail for a year were charged with murder as well. In June of 1995 the Tribunal commenced. Eventually Ken Saro-Wiwa’s lawyers pulled out of the Tribunal due to the false allegations, bribery of key prosecuting witnesses, and its flawed nature. On October 30, 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the eight other men were officially charged with the murder, and sentenced to death. Worldwide people protested this sentencing, and in response the military deployed an additional 5,000 troops to Ogoniland. Finally, on November 10, 1995 the nine were hung in Port Harcourt. An observer of the Tribunal said that it was &quot;not merely wrong, illogical or perverse. It is downright dishonest .. I believe that the Tribunal first decided on its verdict and then sought for arguments to justify them&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Currently the nine men reside in the Port Harcourt Cemetery, in southeastern Nigeria. The MOSOP still meets and works towards further protection and resilience of the Ogoni people. They continue to fight for their rights and land, by stopping Shell from drilling on their land and working with the international community on environmental lawsuits. Since 1993, there has been no continued drilling in Ogoniland; however, the land remains decimated, and underground pipelines continue to leak. This has furthered environmental degradation of the area. While Shell has not cleaned it up, they paid 55 million pounds in reparations in 2014 for two oil spills that occurred in 2008. Across Ogoniland, gas flares and acid rain have stopped, but the vegetation and lands continue to be polluted. Ogoni Day continues to be celebrated on January 4 each year, marking the 30-year anniversary in 2023.

<doc id="432638" wikidata="Q333117" url="?curid=432638" title="James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie">
<text>James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie (22 April 1812 – 19 December 1860), known as the Earl of Dalhousie between 1838 and 1849, was a Scottish statesman and colonial administrator in British India. He served as Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856.

He established the foundations of the colonial educational system in India by adding mass education in addition to elite higher education. He introduced passenger trains to the railways, the electric telegraph and uniform postage, which he described as the &quot;three great engines of social improvement&quot;. He also founded the Public Works Department in India. He stands out as the far-sighted Governor-General who consolidated East India Company rule in India, laid the foundations of its later administration, and by his sound policy enabled his successors to stem the tide of rebellion.

His period of rule in India directly preceded the transformation into the Victorian Raj period of Indian administration. He was denounced by many in Britain on the eve of his death as having failed to notice the signs of the brewing Indian Rebellion of 1857, having aggravated the crisis by his overbearing self-confidence, centralizing activity and expansive annexations.

==Early life==
James Andrew Broun-Ramsay was the third and youngest son of George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie (1770–1838), one of Wellington&#x27;s generals, who, after being Governor General of Canada, became Commander-in-Chief in India, and of his wife, Christian (&quot;née&quot; Broun) of Coalstoun, Haddingtonshire (East Lothian).

The 9th Earl was in 1815 created Baron Dalhousie of Dalhousie Castle in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and had three sons, of whom the two elder died young. James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, his youngest son, was described as small in stature, with a firm chiseled mouth and high forehead.

Several years of his early boyhood were spent with his father and mother in Canada. Returning to Scotland he was prepared for Harrow School, where he entered in 1825. Two years later he and another student, Robert Adair, were expelled after bullying and nearly causing the death of George Rushout, nephew of John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick. Until he entered university, Dalhousie&#x27;s entire education being entrusted to the Rev. Mr Temple, incumbent of a quiet parish in Staffordshire.

In October 1829, he passed on to Christ Church, Oxford, where he worked fairly hard, won some distinction, and made many lifelong friends. His studies, however, were so greatly interrupted by the protracted illness and death in 1832 of his only surviving brother, that Lord Ramsay, as he then became, had to content himself with entering for a pass degree, though he was placed in fourth class of honours for Michaelmas 1833. He then travelled in Italy and Switzerland, enriching with copious entries the diary which he religiously kept up through life, and storing his mind with valuable observations.

==Early political career==

An unsuccessful but courageous contest at the general election in 1835 for one of the seats in parliament for Edinburgh, fought against such veterans as the future speaker, James Abercrombie, afterwards Lord Dunfermline, and John Campbell, future lord chancellor, was followed in 1837 by Ramsay&#x27;s return to the House of Commons as member for Haddingtonshire. In the previous year he had married Lady Susan Hay, daughter of the Marquess of Tweeddale, whose companionship was his chief support in India, and whose death in 1853 left him a heartbroken man. In 1838 his father who died after a long illness, while less than a year later he lost his mother.

Succeeding to the peerage, the new earl soon made his mark in a speech delivered on 16 June 1840 in support of Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s Church of Scotland Benefices Bill, a controversy arising out of the Auchterarder case, in which he had already taken part in the General Assembly in opposition to Dr Chalmers. In May 1843 he became Vice-President of the Board of Trade, Gladstone being President, and was sworn in as a privy counsellor. He was also given the honorary post of Captain of Deal Castle the same year.

Succeeding Gladstone as President of the Board of Trade in 1845, he threw himself into the work during the crisis of the Railway Mania with such energy that his health partially broke down under the strain. In the struggle over the Corn Laws he ranged himself on the side of Sir Robert Peel, and, after the failure of Lord John Russell to form a ministry he resumed his post at the board of trade, entering the cabinet on the retirement of Lord Stanley. When Peel resigned office in June 1846, Lord John offered Dalhousie a seat in the cabinet, an offer which he declined from a fear that acceptance might involve the loss of public character. Another attempt to secure his services in the appointment of president of the railway board was equally unsuccessful; but in 1847 he accepted the post of Governor-General of India in succession to Lord Hardinge, on the understanding that he was to be left in &quot;entire and unquestioned possession&quot; of his own &quot;personal independence with reference to party politics&quot;.

==Governor-General of India==
Dalhousie took charge of his dual duties as Governor-General of India and Governor of Bengal on 12 January 1848, and shortly afterwards he was honoured with the green ribbon of the Order of the Thistle. During this period, he was an extremely hard worker, often working sixteen to eighteen hours a day. The shortest workday Dalhousie would take began at half-past eight and would continue until half-past five, remaining at his desk even during lunch. During this period, he sought to expand the reach of the empire and rode long distances on horseback, in spite of having a bad back.

In contrast to many of the past leaders of the British Empire in India, he saw himself as an Orientalist monarch and believed his rule was that of a modernizer, attempting to bring the British intellectual revolution to India. A staunch utilitarian, he sought to improve Indian society under the prevalent Benthamite ideals of the period. However, in his attempt to do so he ruled with authoritarianism, believing these means were the most likely to increase the material development and progress of India. His policies, especially the doctrine of lapse, contributed to a growing sense of discontent among sectors of Indian society and therefore greatly contributed to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which directly followed his departure from India.

In 1849, under Dalhousie&#x27;s command, the British captured the princely state of Punjab. In the process he captured the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond from the twelve-year old Punjabi Maharaja Duleep Singh. According to usual practise the treasury of Duleep Singh was considered war booty and Duleep Singh was forced to hand over the diamond. The Koh-i-Noor diamond was presented to Queen Victoria and displayed in 1851 and at the Dublin Exhibition in 1853 and the World&#x27;s Fair in London in 1862.

He also commanded the Second Burmese War in 1852, resulting in the capture of parts of Burma. Under his reign, the British implemented the policy of &#x27;lapse and annexation&#x27; which ensured that if a king did not have any sons for a natural heir, the kingdom would be annexed to the British Empire. Using this policy, the British annexed some of the princely states. The annexation of Awadh made Dalhousie very unpopular in the region. This and other callous actions of the governor-general created bitter feelings among the Indian soldiers in the British Army, which finally led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Dalhousie and the British called this uprising the &#x27;Sepoy mutiny&#x27; – Sepoy being the common term for native Indian soldiers in British service. Dalhousie was an able administrator, though forceful and tough. His contribution in the development of communication — railways, roads, postal and telegraph services — contributed to the modernization and unity of India. His notable achievement was the creation of modern, centralized states.

Shortly after assuming his duties, in writing to the president of the Board of Control, Sir John Hobhouse, he was able to assure him that everything was quiet. This statement, however, was to be falsified by events almost before it could reach Britain.

===Second Anglo-Sikh War===
On 19 April 1848 Vans Agnew of the civil service and Lieutenant Anderson of the Bombay European regiment, having been sent to take charge of Multan from Diwan Mulraj, were murdered there, and within a short time the troops and sardars joined in open rebellion. Dalhousie agreed with Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief, that the British East India Company&#x27;s military forces were neither adequately equipped with transport and supplies, nor otherwise prepared to take the field immediately. He afterward decided that the proper response was not merely for the capture of Multan, but also the entire subjugation of the Punjab. He therefore resolutely delayed to strike, organized a strong army for operations in November, and himself proceeded to the Punjab. With evidence that the revolt was spreading outwards, Dalhousie declared, &quot;Unwarned by precedent, uninfluenced by example, the Sikh nation has called for war; and on my words, sirs, war they shall have and with a vengeance.&quot;

Despite the successes gained by Herbert Edwardes in the Second Anglo-Sikh War with Mulraj, and Gough&#x27;s indecisive victories at Ramnagar in November, at Sadulpur in December, and at Chillianwala in the following month, the stubborn resistance at Multan showed that the task required the utmost resources of the government. At length, on 22 January 1849, the Multan fortress was taken by General Whish, who was thus set at liberty to join Gough at Gujarat. Here a complete victory was won on 21 February at the Battle of Gujrat, the Sikh army surrendered at Rawalpindi, and their Afghan allies were chased out of India. In spite of substantial attempts by Sikh and Muslim forces to polarize opposition through religious and anti-British sentiment, Dalhousie&#x27;s military commanders were able to maintain the loyalty of troops, with the exception of a small number of Gurkah deserters. For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the Parliament and a step in the peerage, as Marquess.

The war being now over, Dalhousie, without specific instructions from his superiors, annexed the Punjab. Believing in inherent superiority of British rule over the &quot;archaic&quot; Indian system of rule, Dalhousie attempted to dismantle local rule. However, the province quickly became ruled by a group of &quot;audacious and eccentric and often Evangelical pioneers&quot;. In an attempt to minimize further conflict, he removed a number of these officials, establishing what he believed to be a more logical and rational system in which the Punjab was systematically divided into districts and divisions, governed by District officers and Commissioners respectively. This lasting system of rule established governance through a young maharaja under a triumvirate of the Governor General.

Governance under the established &quot;Punjab School&quot; of Henry and John Lawrence was initially successful, partially due to the system of local cultural respect, while still maintaining British values against acts of widow burning, female infanticide, and burying of lepers alive by small segments of the Indian populace. However, Punjabi rule eventually came to be seen as despotic, largely because of the expansion of judicial system. Although often unpredictable or despotic, many Indians in &quot;rationalized&quot; provinces preferred their previous native rule.

===Second Burmese War===
One further addition to the empire was made by conquest. The Burmese court at Ava was bound by the Treaty of Yandaboo, 1826, to protect British ships in Burmese waters. But there arose a dispute between the Governor of Rangoon and certain British shipping interests (the Monarch and the Champion).

The facts of the event were obscured by conflicts between colonial administrators reporting to the admirals of the navy, rather than the company or civil authorities. The nature of the dispute was mis-represented to Parliament, and Parliament played a role in further &quot;suppressing&quot; the facts released to the public, but most of the facts were established by comparative reading of these conflicting accounts in what was originally an anonymous pamphlet, &quot;How Wars are Got Up in India&quot;; this account by Richard Cobden remains almost the sole contemporaneous account of who actually made the decision to invade and annex Burma.

In defending the pretext for invasion after the fact, Dalhousie quoted the maxim of Lord Wellesley that any insult offered to the British flag at the mouth of the Ganges should be resented as promptly and fully as an insult offered at the mouth of the Thames. Attempts were made to solve the dispute by diplomacy. The Burmese eventually removed the Governor of Rangoon but this not considered sufficient. Commodore Lambert, despatched personally by Dalhousie, deliberately provoked an incident and then announced a war.

The Burmese Kingdom offered little in the way of resistance. Martaban was taken on 5 April 1852, and Rangoon and Bassein shortly afterwards. Since, however, the court of Ava was unwilling to surrender half the country in the name of &quot;peace&quot;, the second campaign opened in October, and after the capture of Prome and Pegu the annexation of the province of Pegu was declared by a proclamation dated 20 December 1853. To any further invasion of the Burmese empire Dalhousie was firmly opposed, being content to cut off Burma&#x27;s commercial and political access to the outside world by the annexation. Some strangely spoke of the war as &quot;uniting&quot; territory, but in practice Arakan, Tenasserim and the new territories were still only linked in practical terms by sea.

By what his supporters considered wise policy he attempted to pacify the new province, placing Colonel Arthur Phayre in sole charge of it, personally visiting it, and establishing a system of telegraphs and communications. In practice, the new province was in language and culture very different from India. It could never successfully integrate into the Indian system. The result of the war was to add an expensive new military and political dependency which did not generate sufficient taxes to pay for itself. British Indian rule of Arakan and Tenasserim had been a financial disaster for the Indian Administration. Multiple times in the 1830s questions were raised about getting rid of these territories altogether. Why Dalhousie was so obsessed with increasing the size of a territory that did not generate sufficient revenue to pay for its own administration has never been explained.

One consequential factor of this war was Dalhousie&#x27;s continuation of the requirement that Sepoys be forced to serve abroad. This created great discontent among Indian sepoys, because it violated the Hindu religious prohibition against travel. In fact, this resulted in the mutiny of several regiments in the Punjab. When this belief that the British were intentionally forcing caste breaking was combined with the widespread belief that the British were intentionally violating Hindu and Muslim purity laws with their new greased cartridges, the consequences (culminating in 1857), would prove to be extremely destructive.

===Policies of reforms===

====Doctrine of Lapse====

The most controversial and tainted &#x27;reform&#x27; developed and implemented under Dalhousie was the policy of taking all legal (often illegal too) means possible to assume control over &quot;lapsed&quot; states. Dalhousie, driven by the conviction that all India needed to be brought under British administration, began to apply what was called the doctrine of lapse. Under the doctrine, the British annexed any non-British state where there was a lack of a proper male lineal heir. Under the policy he recommended the annexation of Satara in January 1849, of Jaitpur and Sambalpur in the same year, and of Jhansi and Nagpur in 1853. In these cases his action was approved by the home authorities, but his proposal to annex Karauli in 1849 was disallowed, while Baghat and the petty estate of Udaipur, which he had annexed in 1851 and 1852 respectively, were afterwards restored to native rule. These annexations are considered by critics to generally represent an uneconomic drain on the financial resources of the company in India.

====Educational reforms====
Dalhousie had a strong personal commitment to the establishment of a national system of education in India. He ensured the successful administration of the provisions contained in the 1854 dispatch.

Dalhousie declared &quot;that no single change was likely to produce more important and beneficial consequences than female education&quot;. The Educational dispatch of 1854 favoured Women&#x27;s education. There was shift in government policy under him from higher education for elite towards mass education for both . He along with Bethune are credited with changing policy in favour of Women&#x27;s education. Dalhousie even personally supported the Bethune Women school from his own money set up by Bethune after his death. Before he left for England he took personal interest and introduced the Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856, permitting widow remarriage which became an act after being approved by his successor, Lord Canning .

====Development of infrastructure====

Other measures with the same object were carried out in the company&#x27;s own territories. Bengal, long ruled by the Governor-General or his delegate, was placed under its own Lieutenant-Governor in May 1854. The military boards were swept away; selection took the place of seniority in the higher commands; an army clothing and a stud department were created, and the medical service underwent complete reorganization. A department of public works was established in each presidency, and engineering colleges were provided. An imperial system of telegraphs followed. The first link of railway communication was completed in 1855, and well-considered plans mapped out the course of other lines and their method of administration. Dalhousie encouraged private enterprise to develop railways in India for the good of the people and also to reduce absolute dependence on the government. However, as an authoritarian, utilitarian ruler, Dalhousie brought the railways under state control-attempting to bring the greatest benefit to India from the expanding network.

In addition, the Ganges Canal was completed; and despite the cost of wars in the Punjab and Burma, liberal provision was made for metalled roads and bridges. The construction of massive irrigation works such as the 350-mile Ganges Canal, which contains thousands of miles of distributaries, was a substantial project that was particularly beneficial for the largely agricultural India. In spite of damaging certain areas of farmland by increasing soil salinity, overall the individuals living along the canal were noticeably better fed and clothed than those who were not. Increasing irrigated area resulted in increase in population. Reforms to improve the condition of the increased population such as immunization and establishment of educational institutions were never implemented. This kept the population poor and bonded to agricultural activities promoting bonded labour.
Europeanization and consolidation of authority were the keynote of his policy. In nine minutes he suggested means for strengthening the Company&#x27;s European forces, calling attention to the dangers that threatened the British community, a handful of scattered strangers; but beyond the additional powers of recruitment which at his entreaty were granted in the Government of India Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 95), his proposals were shelved by the home authorities as they represented yet more expense added to the cost of India. In his administration Dalhousie vigorously asserted his control over even minor military affairs, and when Sir Charles Napier ordered certain allowances, given as compensation for the dearness of provisions, to be granted to the sepoys on a system which had not been sanctioned from headquarters, and threatened to repeat the offence, the Governor-General rebuked him to such a degree that Napier resigned his command.

Dalhousie&#x27;s reforms were not confined to the departments of public works and military affairs. He created an imperial system of post-offices, reducing the rates of carrying letters and introducing postage stamps. He created the department of public instruction; he improved the system of inspection of goals, abolishing the practice of branding convicts; freed converts to other religions from the loss of their civil rights; inaugurated the system of administrative reports; and enlarged the Legislative Council of India. His wide interest in everything that concerned the welfare of British economic interests in the country was shown in the encouragement he gave to the culture of tea, in his protection of forests, in the preservation of ancient and historic monuments. With the object of making the civil administration more European, he closed what he considered to be the useless college in Calcutta for the education of young civilians, establishing in its place a European system of training them in mufasal stations, and subjecting them to departmental examinations. He was equally careful of the well-being of the European soldier, providing him with healthy recreations and public gardens.

====Civil Service reform====
To the civil service he gave improved leave and pension rules, while he purified its moral by forbidding all share in trading concerns, by vigorously punishing insolvents, and by his personal example of careful selection in the matter of patronage. No Governor-General ever penned a larger number of weighty papers dealing with public affairs in India. Even after laying down office and while on his way home, he forced himself, ill as he was, to review his own administration in a document of such importance that the House of Commons gave orders for its being printed (Blue Book 245 of 1856).
Another consequential set of reforms, were those aimed at modernizing the land tenure and revenue system. Throughout his time in office, Dalhousie disposed large landowners from portions of their estates. He also implemented policies attempting to end the rule of the zamindar tax farmers, as he viewed them as destructive &quot;drones of the soil&quot;. However, thousands of smaller landlords had their holdings completely removed as did the relatively poor who leased small parcels of their land while farming the rest. This was particularly significant as the sepoys were often recruited from these economic groups.
He introduced a system of open competition as the basis of recruitment for civil servants of the company and thus deprived the Directors of their patronage system under Government of India Act 1853.

===Foreign policy===
His foreign policy was guided by a desire to reduce the nominal independence of the larger native states, and to avoid extending the political relations of his government with foreign powers outside India. Pressed to intervene in Hyderabad, he refused to do so, claiming on this occasion that interference was only justified if the administration of native princes tends unquestionably to the injury of the subjects or of the allies of the British government. He negotiated in 1853 a treaty with the nizam, which provided funds for the maintenance of the contingent kept up by the British in support of that princes&#x27; authority, by the assignment of the Berars in lieu of annual payments of the cost and large outstanding arrears. The Berar treaty, he told Sir Charles Wood, is more likely to keep the nizam on his throne than anything that has happened for 50 years to him, while at the same time the control thus acquired over a strip of territory intervening between Bombay and Nagpur promoted his policy of consolidation and his schemes of railway extension. The same spirit induced him to tolerate a war of succession in Bahawalpur, so long as the contending candidates did not violate British territory.

He refrained from punishing Dost Mohammad for the part he had taken in the Sikh War, and resolutely to refuse to enter upon any negotiations until the amir himself came forward. Then he steered a middle course between the proposals of his own agent, Herbert Edwardes, who advocated an offensive alliance, and those of John Lawrence, who would have avoided any sort of engagement. He himself drafted the short treaty of peace and friendship which Lawrence signed in 1855, that officer receiving in 1856 the Order of the Bath as a Knight Commander in acknowledgement of his services in the matter. While, however, Dalhousie was content with a mutual engagement with the Afghan chief, binding each party to respect the territories of the other, he saw that a larger measure of interference was needed in Baluchistan, and with the Khan of Kalat he authorized Major Jacob to negotiate a treaty of subordinate co-operation on 14 May 1854.

The khan was guaranteed an annual subsidy of Rs. 50,000, in return for the treaty which bound him to the British wholly and exclusively. To this the home authorities demurred, but the engagement was duly ratified, and the subsidy was largely increased by Dalhousies successors. On the other hand, he insisted on leaving all matters concerning Persia and Central Asia to the decision of the queen&#x27;s advisers. After the conquest of the Punjab, he began the expensive process of attempting to police and control the Northwest Frontier region. The hillmen, he wrote, regard the plains as their food and prey, and the Afridis, Mohmands, Black Mountain tribes, Waziris and others had to be taught that their new neighbours would not tolerate outrages. But he proclaimed to one and all his desire for peace, and urged upon them the duty of tribal responsibility. Nevertheless, the military engagement on the northwest frontier of India he began grew yearly in cost and continued without pause until the British left Pakistan.

The annexation of Oudh was reserved to the last. The home authorities had asked Dalhousie to prolong his tenure of office during the Crimean War, but the difficulties of the problem no less than complications elsewhere had induced him to delay operations. In 1854 he appointed Outram as resident at the court of Lucknow, directing him to submit a report on the condition of the province. This was furnished in March 1855. The report provided the British an excuse for action based on &quot;disorder and misrule&quot;. Dalhousie, looking at the treaty of 1801, decided that he could do as he wished with Oudh as long as he had the king&#x27;s consent. He then demanded a transfer to the Company of the entire administration of Oudh, the king merely retaining his royal rank, certain privileges in the courts, and a liberal allowance. If he should refuse this arrangement, a general rising would be arranged, and then the British government would intervene on its own terms.

On 21 November 1855, the court of directors instructed Dalhousie to assume the control of Oudh, and to give the king no option unless he was sure that his majesty would surrender the administration rather than risk a revolution. Dalhousie was in bad health and on the eve of retirement when the belated orders reached him; but he at once laid down instructions for Outram in every detail, moved up troops, and elaborated a scheme of government with particular orders as to conciliating local opinion. The king refused to sign the ultimatum (in the form of a &quot;treaty&quot;) put before him, and a proclamation annexing the province was therefore issued on 13 February 1856.

In his mind, only one important matter now remained to him before quitting office. The insurrection of the Kolarian Santals of Bengal against the extortions of landlords and moneylenders had been severely repressed, but the causes of the insurrection had still to be reviewed and a remedy provided. By removing the tract of country from local rule, enforcing the residence of British officers there, and employing the Santal headmen in a local police, he created a system of administration which proved successful in maintaining order.

==Return to Britain==
Dalhousie, on 6 March 1856, set sail for England on board the Company&#x27;s &quot;Firoze,&quot; an object of general sympathy and not less general respect. At Alexandria he was carried by H.M.S. &quot;Caradoc&quot; to Malta, and thence by the &quot;Tribune&quot; to Spithead, which he reached on 13 May. His return had been eagerly looked for by statesmen who hoped that he would resume his public career, by the Company which voted him an annual pension of , and by the queen who earnestly prayed for the blessing of restored health and strength; conversely, the outbreak of the &quot;Sepoy Mutiny&quot; led to bitter attacks on the record of his policy, and to widespread criticisms (both fair and unfair) of his political interests and career. His health deteriorated in Malta and at Malvern, Edinburgh, where he sought medical treatment. In his correspondence and public statements, he was careful not to assign blame or cause embarrassment to colleagues in government. During this period, John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence invoked his counsel and influence. By his last wish, his private journal and papers of personal interest were sealed against publication or inquiry for fully 50 years after his death. As he had no sons the marquessate became extinct on his death.

==Legacy and commemoration==
Established in 1854 by the British Empire in India as a summer retreat for its troops and bureaucrats, the hill station of Dalhousie was named after Lord Dalhousie who was Governor-General of India at that time.

<doc id="432640" wikidata="Q452930" url="?curid=432640" title="Edit decision list">
<text>An edit decision list or EDL is used in the post-production process of film editing and video editing. The list contains an ordered list of reel and timecode data representing where each video clip can be obtained in order to conform the final cut.

EDLs are created by offline editing systems, or can be paper documents constructed by hand such as shot logging. These days, linear video editing systems have been superseded by non-linear editing (NLE) systems which can output EDLs electronically to allow autoconform on an online editing system – the recreation of an edited programme from the original sources (usually video tapes) and the editing decisions in the EDL.

They are also often used in the digital video editing world, so rather than referring to reels they can refer to sequences of images stored on disk.

Some formats, such as CMX3600, can represent simple editing decisions only. Final Cut Pro XML, the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF), and AviSynth scripts are relatively advanced file formats that can contain sophisticated EDLs.

== B-Roll ==
Linear editing systems cannot dissolve between clips on the same video tape. Hence, one of these clips will need to be dubbed onto a new video tape. EDLs designate these occurrences by marking such dissolves&#x27; source reels as B-roll of &quot;b-reels&quot;. For example, the EDL will change the 8th character of the reel name to the letter B.

However, sometimes editors will (confusingly) use the letter B to designate time code breaks on a video tape. If there is broken time code on a video tape, there will be two (or more) instances of a particular time code on the video tape. When re-capturing, it can be ambiguous as to which timecode is the right one. The letter B may indicate that the right time code is from the second set of timecode on the video tape.

==Incompatibilities and potential problems==
EDL formats such as CMX, GVG, Sony, Final Cut Pro, and Avid are similar but can differ in small (but important) ways. Particular attention should be paid to reel naming convention. On the Avid, reel names can be up to 32 characters, but user should be aware that these EDLs don&#x27;t adhere to online editing machine control specifications. These are used by systems that have modified the import/export code to handle file-based workflows as tape acquisition formats wane. On FCP, in CMX3600 format, only eight characters are allowed. Particular attention should be paid towards b-reels. If the EDL handles dissolves to the same reel, reel names should be limited to 7 characters since the 8th character may be replaced.

EDLs can use either drop-frame (DF) or non drop-frame timecode (NDF), running at 24fps (non drop-frame only), 25fps (non drop-frame only), and 30fps (drop-frame and non drop-frame).

Overall, EDLs are still commonly used as some systems do not support other more robust formats such as AAF and XML.

== Systems known to support EDL to some extent ==
Almost any professional editing system and many others support some form of XML/EDL saving/processing.

Some that make the list:
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Avid Media Composer
* Blender supports EDL in versions 2.4x and versions from 2.66
* Cinelerra 
* DaVinci Resolve
* Digital Vision Nucoda and Phoenix
* Final Cut Pro
* Lightworks
* MediaCoder
* Shotcut
* The Foundry HIERO
* Thydrjs Dream II and Xynergi systems
* Vegas Pro

== Systems supporting EDL playback, not just EDL cutting ==
Probably most of the above, plus any professional editing system, plus

* Avidemux project files.
* Bs.player 
* MPlayer (EDL specifies what to skip or mute; only one source file per EDL; see also http://linuxgazette.net/178/brownss.html)
* MPlayer2 (EDL specifies what to show from which file)
* mpv (EDL specifies what to show from which file; different from MPlayer and MPlayer2)
* MythTV cut list
* SageTV
* SMPlayer automatically loads and applies a matching EDL file to the current movie being played
* VLC media player with xspf files that specify start and end times, or with movie content editor
* Kodi/XBMC
* Zoom Player Max
* mrViewer with reels files, which are plain ASCII files.

==See also==
*AES31
*Keykode (Film editing)
*Commercial skipping sometimes uses EDLs to track commercial blocks.
*Magisto

<text>Pseudopodospermum hispanicum, commonly known as black salsify or Spanish salsify, also known as black oyster plant, serpent root, viper&#x27;s herb, viper&#x27;s grass or simply scorzonera, is a perennial species of plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), cultivated as a root vegetable in the same way as purple salsify (&quot;Tragopogon porrifolius&quot;), also in the sunflower family. It is native to Southern Europe and cultivated as a crop in Southern and Central Europe. It grows on nutrient poor soils, dry pasture, rocky areas, in thickets and on limy or marly soils of temperate zones.

==Description==

&quot;Pseudopodospermum hispanicum&quot; is grown commercially as an annual, although it is a biennial plant. After a vegetative phase in the first year, the plant flowers in its second year and can reach a height of 60 cm with a stem diameter of 5 cm. The hermaphroditic flowers are insect-pollinated. The flower-head is terminal and consists of yellow ray florets. The stem is smooth and leafy and the leaves are lanceolate to ovate with entire margins. Black salsify forms a long cylindrical taproot with a brownish to black cork layer. If harvested young, the carrot-like roots are tender, long and tapered with shiny white flesh. They contain a milky latex, which turns the roots black when exposed to air.

==History== 
Black salsify is native to Southern Europe and the Near East. As is indicated by its binomial name, it is generally thought to have spread to the rest of Europe from Spain, but the first mention of the vegetable by a Western writer came from Leonhard Rauwolf, who reported seeing scorzonera at the market of Aleppo in Syria, in 1575. In 1612, François Gentil, in his &quot;Le Jardinier Solitaire&quot; (The Lonely Gardener), described the Spanish salsify as the best root which can be grown in gardens. By 1683, the use of the root as a garden vegetable is recorded in England. Quintyne in France, in 1690, calls it &quot;one of our chiefest roots.&quot; 

It was believed that the plant makes a good antidote against bites of venomous animals. Based on this, it was often claimed that the name scorzonera derives from the Old French word &quot;scorzon&quot; meaning snake (or &quot;adder&quot; to be exact). The most likely etymological root, though, is the Catalan word &quot;escurçonera&quot;, deriving from &quot;escurçó&quot; (viper), where the suffix -nera conveys an association or use with regards to vipers. &quot;Scorzonera&quot; must be an italian transliteration of &quot;escurçonera&quot;, explained by the long Catalan presence in Sardinia and southern Italy, influencing local languages between the 14th and 18th centuries. Less likely, the name might derive from Italian &quot;scorza negra&quot; meaning &quot;black bark&quot;/&quot;black peel&quot;, after the dark brown to black skin of the root. The plant was being cultivated as a vegetable in Italy and France by 1660 and, soon after, vast fields were grown of it in what is now Belgium.

==Nutritional value==
Black salsify is considered nutritious: it contains proteins, fats, asparagine, choline, laevulin, as well as minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and vitamins A, B1, E and C. It also contains the polysaccharide inulin, conferring a mild sweetness that is suitable for diabetics. Inulin, used as a dietary fibre, may have a positive effect on the digestive system, blood circulation, kidneys and inhibit cancerous processes.
==Preparation==
Various parts of the plant can be consumed, including roots, leafy shoots, and open flowers, either cooked or raw. The principal product however are the stem tuber roots.
The thick black skin of the salsify root is usually considered inedible and can be removed either prior to or after boiling. If the skin is removed prior to boiling, the peeled root should be immediately immersed in water mixed with vinegar or lemon juice, in order to prevent discolouring. Since the root contains an extremely sticky latex, it is often more convenient to peel it after boiling the root for 20 to 25 minutes (or less). Residue of the latex can be removed by rubbing with a drop of oil and then washing with soap.

Black salsify is often eaten together with other vegetables, such as peas and carrots. But it is also popular served like asparagus in a white sauce, such as bechamel sauce, mustard sauce or hollandaise sauce. Boiled salsify roots may also be coated with batter and deep fried.
The young roots are used in salads and the salsify latex can be used as chewing gum. Flowering shoots are consumed similarly to asparagus and the flowers can be added to salads, together with brown seedlings or the long clumps of grass-like green leaves.

The scorzonera sweet is a crystallized dessert made from scorzonera in Évora, Alentejo, Portugal. It is listed on the Ark of Taste.

==Cultivation==
Black salsify is hitherto mainly a European crop. Belgium, France and the Netherlands are the world&#x27;s largest producers of black salsify; significant amounts are also produced in Germany. In the latter country, &#x27;Hoffmanns Schwarzer Pfahl&#x27; is a cultivar widely used by commercial growers, while &#x27;Duplex&#x27; is popular among small-scale gardeners. Some other cultivars are commercially available, but because it was a rather localized crop before being produced for a wider market there are comparatively few landraces. Collections of local races and old cultivars can be found at the Nordic Genetic Resource Center in Sweden and the Vavilov Institute of Plant-Genetic Resources in Russia.

=== Cultivars ===
Black salsify cultivars differ in taste, size, region of origin and harvest time. The following table shows some popular examples.

Breeding objectives are reduced susceptibility to bolting, low percentage of roots with cavities, improved suitability for mechanical sowing and harvesting, as well as for industrial processing.

=== Sowing ===
Scorzonera is sown in early spring, preferably at the end of April. Sowing too early can result in early flowering and loss of yield. About 12 kg of seeds per hectare are required. The seeds are sown directly into shallow furrows at a depth of 1.5 – 2 cm with 30–50 cm in between them. Plants should stand at a density of 50 plants/m2 for optimal yield. Because of the seeds’ unusual shape, machine sowing is difficult. Storage of seeds is also a critical point, as germination is usually only guaranteed for 1–2 years. Optimal storage conditions are dry and cool.

=== Soil requirements ===
The roots develop best in very light textured, sandy soil. Any stones or gravel in the ground can cause root deformation. Ideal pH values are between 5.8 – 6.5 and liming is recommended for more acidic soils. A high humus content is beneficial. Generally, the species can grow in a variety of conditions and has potential to be grown as a cash crop in less favorable, marginal environments in temperate zones.

=== Harvesting and post-harvest treatment ===
Harvesting takes place from November to March, with the optimum time for high quality being end of December. The process is somewhat complicated, as the roots are quite fragile, and broken material loses its freshness. Entire roots will keep fresh all winter if stored in a cool dark place, due to their robust black corky skin. In root cellars they may keep fresh well into springtime. The roots can also be washed, peeled, cut and then frozen. In supermarkets, they can be bought conserved in glass or canned. On farmer’s markets, the roots are sold unwashed to secure quality and freshness. Black salsify is, however, very hardy and frost-resistant and will grow well in most cool-temperate climates and usually yield 15–20 tonnes of roots per hectare. In British gardens it is common to profit from its perennial character by leaving it in the ground until its roots have grown to sufficient size for harvesting; this can take two years. Commercially, it can be grown best as the year&#x27;s second crop. It is recommended to have three to four years in the crop rotation before the cultivation of other Asteraceae.

== Pests and diseases ==
=== Pests ===
* Carrot rust fly (&quot;Psila rosae&quot;): The larvae or maggots of the carrot rust fly eat the plant roots and entrench themselves in the roots. &quot;Psila&quot; thereby inhibits plant growth and facilitates infection by soft-rot bacteria. Generally root crops are popular for the carrot rust fly.
* Wireworms (&quot;Selatosomus destructor and Ctenicera pruinina&quot;): The wireworms are the larvae of click beetles, which remain in the larval stage for between 2–5 years. They live in the soil and feed on roots. The wireworms cause a lot of damage when they bore directly into the roots. Plant pathogens can gain access through this, which can lead to rotting of the roots. Root rot can lead to wilting, stunting and deformation of the seedlings and eventually to death.
* Root knot nematode (&quot;Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, M. hapla and M. arenaria&quot;): Can cause great damage to the roots of salsify. Nematode activity damages growing root tips, causing branching, distortion, stunting and deformation of the taproot. The result can be general stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis (yellowing) above ground.

=== Diseases ===
* Bacterial soft rot (&quot;Bacillus carotovorus&quot; Jones): The bacteria eat the root core. This can be recognised by a soft, watery and slimy root rot. This in turn facilitates infection by vertical fungi or bacteria. The ideal temperature for bacterial soft rot is 21 °C - 27 °C, but it can survive and cause damage at temperatures between 0 °C - 32 °C. For this reason, the air must be properly ventilated when storing and transporting the crop in tropical and warm environments.
* White blister (&quot;Albugo&quot; spp.): a leaf disease that favours wet weather. It is related to the pathogens of downy mildew and the two can also occur together. White blisters form blister-like white pustules on the underside of the leaves. A purple pigmentation is visible around the affected areas. This reduces plant growth and heavily infested plant parts may shrivel or even die.

<doc id="432648" wikidata="Q21175464" url="?curid=432648" title="Matrix theory (physics)">
<text>In theoretical physics, the matrix theory is a quantum mechanical model proposed in 1997 by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind; it is also known as BFSS matrix model, after the authors&#x27; initials.

==Overview==
This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting. The BFSS matrix model is also considered the worldvolume theory of a large number of D0-branes in Type IIA string theory.

==Noncommutative geometry==

In geometry, it is often useful to introduce coordinates. For example, in order to study the geometry of the Euclidean plane, one defines the coordinates and as the distances between any point in the plane and a pair of axes. In ordinary geometry, the coordinates of a point are numbers, so they can be multiplied, and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication. That is, . This property of multiplication is known as the commutative law, and this relationship between geometry and the commutative algebra of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry.

Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation. Rather than working with ordinary numbers, one considers some similar objects, such as matrices, whose multiplication does not satisfy the commutative law (that is, objects for which is not necessarily equal to ). One imagines that these noncommuting objects are coordinates on some more general notion of &quot;space&quot; and proves theorems about these generalized spaces by exploiting the analogy with ordinary geometry.

In a paper from 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a noncommutative quantum field theory, a special kind of physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.

==Related models==
Another notable matrix model capturing aspects of Type IIB string theory, the IKKT matrix model, was constructed in 1996–97 by N. Ishibashi, H. Kawai, Y. Kitazawa, A. Tsuchiya.

<text>Philip Hansen Anselmo (born June 30, 1968) is an American heavy metal musician best known as the lead singer for Pantera, Down, and Superjoint, amongst other musical projects. He is the owner of Housecore Records.

Anselmo is regarded as one of the greatest frontmen in metal history, known for being particularly animated and donning a machismo attitude that became emblematic of the general theme of Pantera. Earlier in his career with the band, Anselmo took considerable inspiration from heavy metal vocalists such as Rob Halford, singing in full head voice. However, he later became recognized for a more abrasive style of vocals.

==Early life==
Anselmo was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is mainly of Italian and French heritage. He is also Danish through his great maternal grandmother. He attended many schools across Louisiana and Texas, the last of which was Grace King High School in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, which he dropped out of during 12th grade. Anselmo&#x27;s father, Phil, owned and operated a restaurant in Metairie called Anselmo&#x27;s, which closed following Hurricane Katrina. Anselmo has said in various interviews that he was the class clown as a child. As a teenager, Anselmo accidentally started a fire in his parents&#x27; house while attempting to prank his sister. The incident resulted in smoke damage to most of the furniture and part of the house needing renovation. Anselmo worked on a shrimp boat with his stepfather in his teenage years, and claims to have witnessed a man be poisoned by a scorpionfish.

==Career==
In 1981, Anselmo co-formed his first band, Samhain (not to be confused with Glenn Danzig&#x27;s band of the same name), together with friends from around the area, performing vocal and guitar duties. In 1985, he joined the band Rapid Phaze who would later rename themselves to Razor White, after one of the songs Anselmo wrote. While they did have some original material, they mainly played cover songs of popular rock and metal bands. Around this time, Anselmo quit high school to concentrate on his musical career. After about a year-plus with the band, he became frustrated with Razor White&#x27;s direction and began to explore other options.

===Pantera===
By 1986, Pantera had released three albums via Metal Magic Records, but did not garner much attention, because the band was not signed with a major record label at the time. Seeking a new frontman to continue down a heavier path, the band&#x27;s original singer Terry Glaze, who was primarily a glam metal vocalist, left the band. In 1986, after several meetings, then-18-year old Anselmo was officially added to the Pantera lineup. Anselmo relocated to Texas to record Pantera&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Power Metal,&quot; which was released in 1988.

Following the release of &quot;Power Metal&quot;, the band dropped its glam image and adopted a more casual look. In 1989, after being rejected &quot;28 times by every major label on the face of the Earth&quot;, Pantera signed to Atco Records, and released their fifth album, &quot;Cowboys from Hell,&quot; in the following year, which paved the way towards the band&#x27;s stardom and defined a new style of metal known as groove metal. As a tour unfolded to promote the band&#x27;s latest album, there was documented portions of this tour on their first home video, &quot;Cowboys from Hell: The Videos,&quot; released in 1991.

In 1992, Pantera released their sixth studio album, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, which featured an even heavier sound than its predecessor. In 1994, they released &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, which debuted at No. 1 in the United States.

In late June, Anselmo was charged with assault following an altercation with a security guard when fans were prevented from getting on stage. He was released on $5,000 bail the next day. The trial was delayed three times. In May 1995, he apologized in court, pleaded guilty to attempted assault, and was ordered to undergo 100 hours of community service.

In 1996, Pantera released their eighth studio album, &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill.&quot; Due to growing tensions between Anselmo and the rest of the band, he recorded the vocal tracks for this album in New Orleans, while the other members recorded in Texas. In 1997, Pantera released their first and only official live album titled &quot;Official Live: 101 Proof.&quot; This album contained the two new tracks, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hide&quot; and &quot;Where You Come From&quot;. In 2000, Pantera released their ninth and final studio album, &quot;Reinventing the Steel.&quot; After touring to promote the album, Pantera went on hiatus in 2001. In 2003, Pantera released their first compilation album, &quot;The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys&#x27; Vulgar Hits!&quot; (alternatively titled &quot;Reinventing Hell: The Best of Pantera&quot; in Europe). The album featured songs from five studio albums with Anselmo, and also included three cover tracks. A bonus DVD was also made, containing all of the band&#x27;s music videos. Later that year, Pantera disbanded over communication problems and accusations that Anselmo had neglected the band.

In July 2022, it was announced that Anselmo would be joining bassist Rex Brown, along with Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante (as the respective fill-ins for Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul), for Pantera&#x27;s first world tour in 22 years in 2023.

==== Post-Pantera ====
Following the disbandment, Anselmo devoted much of his time to a longtime side project, Superjoint Ritual. Having heard of this, the Abbott brothers of Pantera (guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul) went on to form Damageplan with guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals and Bob Zilla on bass.

After Vinnie Paul slammed Superjoint Ritual, saying Anselmo could not even keep his eyes open, Anselmo responded and replied, &quot;I just hear a big and sad yellowbelly crybaby fuckin&#x27; knowing that his meal ticket is in a different fuckin&#x27; band ... You would have to know those guys to really understand where I was coming from. They&#x27;re scared of their own fuckin&#x27; shadows. And, all that said, I wish them the best of fuckin&#x27; luck. I still love &#x27;em.&quot; Anselmo had engaged in a war of words with Dimebag Darrell since the disbandment of Pantera, culminating in the statement &quot;Dimebag deserves to be beaten severely&quot; in the December 2004 edition of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. Initially, he denied making the statement, but later changed his story in a VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; special on Pantera, claiming that the comment had been lighthearted and made off the record. However, Vinnie Paul told the press that he had heard the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted.

In December 2004, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed while performing with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. At the request of Darrell&#x27;s family, Anselmo did not attend his funeral.

In a lengthy and emotional video posted on Down&#x27;s official website, Anselmo described his regret over his previous behavior, and has written and recorded music dealing with the loss of Darrell on the Down record &quot;Over the Under.&quot; The band dedicated their song &quot;Lifer&quot; to Darrell. Anselmo stated that he wished to restart his friendship with Vinnie Paul, but a reconciliation had not occurred when Paul died on June 22, 2018.

In a July 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Anselmo spoke out against Pantera and his other band&#x27;s usage of the Confederate flag, saying that it was a mistake to use it on their merchandise, albums, and other promotional material. Anselmo said &quot;These days, I wouldn&#x27;t want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully ... I wouldn&#x27;t. The way I feel and the group of people I&#x27;ve had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says &#x27;Heritage, not hate.&#x27; I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;m buying into that.&quot; Anselmo said originally, that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd, but it was never about promoting hate.

===Down===

Down is a heavy metal supergroup formed in 1991 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band consists of members and former members of Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, and Eyehategod.

Since its inception, Down has released three studio albums (&quot;NOLA&quot;, &quot;A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot;, &quot;Over the Under),&quot; two EPs, one live album, and has gone on hiatus twice to focus on the members&#x27; respective bands.

===Superjoint/Superjoint Ritual===
Superjoint Ritual is a New Orleans metal band formed by Anselmo, Joe Fazzio, and Jimmy Bower in the early 1990s, later to be joined by Hank Williams III and Kevin Bond. Their style can be considered a mix of sludge metal and hardcore punk. According to Bower, Anselmo wrote 70–80% of the group&#x27;s music. During their time together they have released three full-length albums via Sanctuary Records, &quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot; in 2002, &quot;A Lethal Dose of American Hatred&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Caught Up in the Gears of Application&quot; in 2016.

===Side projects===
====Arson Anthem====

Arson Anthem is a Southern hardcore punk project that originated when Eyehategod singer Mike Williams moved into Anselmo&#x27;s spare apartment after losing all his possessions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The two spent countless hours listening to Anselmo&#x27;s collection of early hardcore bands. They began jamming with Hank Williams III and Collin Yeo, who were united by their desire to have a hardcore/crust punk band of their own. The Arson Anthem lineup features Mike Williams on vocals, Anselmo on guitar, Hank Williams III on drums, and Collin Yeo on bass.

====Christ Inversion====
Christ Inversion was formed in 1994. The group was a short-lived black metal/sludge metal project formed by Anselmo, where he played guitar under the alias &quot;Anton Crowley&quot;, it also featured Wayne Fabra on vocals, best known for being part of Necrophagia and for playing drums in Graveyard Rodeo. Most of their lyrics were based on horror films and Satanism. The band recorded two demos in 1994 and 1995 respectively, and then disbanded without ever recording a full-length album. Many years later, songs from the first demo were put on an eight-track compilation and released through Anselmo&#x27;s own Housecore Records on October 28, 2008. The second demo was also planned to see a re-release, however this never surfaced.

====Southern Isolation====
The band on October 30, 2001 released one EP called &quot;Southern Isolation&quot;. It originally contained four songs but was later re-released in 2002 with a fifth bonus track. The band consisted of Anselmo&#x27;s then-girlfriend Stephanie Opal Weinstein on vocals, Anselmo on vocals, backing vocals and guitars, &quot;Big&quot; Ross Karpelman (of Clearlight) on keyboards, and Sid Montz (of Crowbar) on drums.

One rare track called &quot;Faded&quot; has been credited to Southern Isolation on the Manson Family soundtrack.

====Viking Crown====

In the mid-1990s, Anselmo began to record for several side projects under the alias &quot;Anton Crowley&quot;, most notably with Viking Crown. The name Anton Crowley is taken from Aleister Crowley (British occultist) and Anton LaVey (founder and high priest of the Church of Satan). Viking Crown was a short-lived and essentially solo side project by Anselmo. The members of the band were Anselmo (as Anton Crowley) on guitars, bass and drums; Killjoy on vocals; and Opal Enthroned (Stephanie Opal Weinstein) on keyboards. On their first album &quot;Unorthodox Steps of Ritual&quot;, Anselmo played every instrument and laid down his own vocals. The band never performed live.

====Eibon====
Eibon was a short-lived supergroup, which Anselmo participated in from 1998 to 2000. The group featured Killjoy, Fenriz, Satyr, and Maniac. The project has been put on indefinite hiatus, and to date, it has only released only a single track, &quot;Mirror Soul Jesus&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Moonfog 2000: A Different Perspective&quot; compilation in 2000. The band was on Satyr&#x27;s record label Moonfog Productions.

====Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals====

During 2011–2012, Anselmo wrote and recorded a solo album, &quot;Walk Through Exits Only&quot;, with his backing band The Illegals. It was released on July 16, 2013. In October 2017, the second album, &quot;Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue&quot;, was announced, originally due in December but postponed to January 26, 2018. The first song off the second album, &quot;Choosing Mental Illness&quot;, was made available for streaming. The next song, &quot;The Ignorant Point&quot;, was released on December 13, 2017. Exclaim! gave the album a rating of 8 out of 10.

The band consists of Anselmo on vocals, Stephen Taylor on rhythm guitar, Joey Gonzalez on drums, Mike DeLeon on lead guitar and Derek Engemann on bass.

====Scour====

It was announced in May 2016 that Anselmo would be fronting a new band, Scour, with members from Pig Destroyer (John Jarvis), Cattle Decapitation (Derek Engemann), Animosity (Chase Fraser), and Strong Intention (Jesse Schobel). The band is stylistically black metal, with the exception of Anselmo&#x27;s use of lower growling instead of the higher, raspier vocals commonly associated with the genre. James Christopher Monger of AllMusic described the band&#x27;s sound as a &quot;punishing mix of black metal, grindcore, and thrash&quot;.

The band&#x27;s self-titled debut EP was released in July 2016 via Anselmo&#x27;s label Housecore Records, featuring six songs all under three minutes in length. Scour&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Red&quot;, was released in September 2017. The title track and the song &quot;Piles&quot; were made available for streaming ahead of the release of the EP. Scour released their third EP, titled &quot;Black&quot;, on November 27, 2020.

Scour&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Gold&quot;, was released on February 21, 2025.

====En Minor====
In a September 27, 2017 interview with Jimmy Cabbs&#x27; &quot;5150&quot; interview series, Anselmo announced a new project called En Minor, which he said is influenced by the artists of the classic 1980s gothic rock period. The band released a single on August 2, 2019, containing the tracks &quot;On the Floor&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Long Way to Go&quot;.

The first full-length album, &quot;When the Cold Truth Has Worn Its Miserable Welcome Out&quot;, was released via Anselmo&#x27;s own record label Housecore in the US and via Season of Mist in Europe in September 2020.

===Other appearances and releases===

Using the Anton Crowley aliases, Anselmo appeared on the 1998 &quot;Holocausto de la Morte&quot; album, the 1999 &quot;Black Blood Vomitorium&quot; EP, and finally the 2001 &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; EP, which featured Opal Enthroned (then Anselmo&#x27;s wife) on keyboards. Anselmo left the band in 2001.

In 1998, Anthrax released the album &quot;Volume 8: The Threat Is Real&quot;. Anselmo provided backing vocals on track 8 (&quot;Killing Box&quot;). Also, his Pantera bandmate Dimebag Darrell played guitar solos on tracks 3 (&quot;Inside Out&quot;) and 7 (&quot;Born Again Idiot&quot;).

In 1998, Anselmo sang a duet (&quot;By the River&quot;) on Vision of Disorder&#x27;s &quot;Imprint&quot; album.

In 2000, Tony Iommi released a collaborative album with various well known vocalists. Initially, Anselmo was going to co-create an entire album with Iommi, but due to tour schedules it never happened. Anselmo managed, however, to lay down some tracks for Iommi&#x27;s album. Iommi and Anselmo wrote and recorded three tracks together, &quot;Time Is Mine&quot;, &quot;Inversion of the Saviours&quot;, and a third unknown track. Iommi picked &quot;Time Is Mine&quot; for the album. &quot;Inversion of the Saviours&quot; was never officially released, but can be found online. The third unknown track is now highly sought after by fans of both artists.

In 2001, Anselmo provided additional vocals for &quot;HFFK&quot; on Biohazard&#x27;s &quot;Uncivilization&quot; album.

On March 6, 2006, Anselmo made an appearance along with Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver bassist Duff McKagan and the surviving members of Alice in Chains at a VH1&#x27;s Decades Rock Live concert, in honor of the band Heart.

In 2014, Anselmo appeared in the YouTube comedy series &quot;Metal Grasshopper&quot; with comedian Dave Hill, in which he instructs Hill on how to &quot;be&quot; metal.

In 2015, Anselmo contributed backing vocals to &quot;The Prophets of Loss&quot;, a song from the Cattle Decapitation album &quot;The Anthropocene Extinction&quot;, released in August 2015.

In January 2016, Anselmo sang lead vocals in a band which included Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. They performed the song &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; by recently deceased Lemmy Kilmister, who played for Hawkwind and Motörhead.

In 2017, Anselmo released a six-song EP titled &quot;Songs of Darkness and Despair&quot; together with Bill Moseley (under the name Bill + Phil). Anselmo and Moseley both provide vocals on the release. The songs were improvized in three days after Moseley brought his lyrics.

===Housecore Records=== 
Anselmo started his own record label called Housecore Records sometime in 2001. After gaining permission from Pantera&#x27;s label, Elektra, he merged Housecore with his longtime friend and Necrophagia bandmate Killjoy&#x27;s label, Baphomet Records. The newly named &quot;Baphomet/Housecore Records&quot; secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated &quot;What you&#x27;re going to get here with Baphomet/Housecore, it&#x27;s going to be different. It&#x27;s going to be a fresh approach. It&#x27;s going to be a lot of home made shit, not all major label-produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I&#x27;ve ever fucking done. Each band that I&#x27;m involved in outside of Pantera is a way for me to express and develop different outlets that are very much a part of me. With Pantera it&#x27;s only one side of me. I love to write and create music, and the side bands are very different from Pantera. They also show the flexibility in me as a musician; Pantera&#x27;s very important in my life, but there&#x27;s many other things that keep this boy here content&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baphomet/Housecore Records&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After only three releases, Anselmo and Killjoy severed business ties, thus returning Anselmo&#x27;s label to its original name, Housecore Records. Housecore is now actively releasing material by Anselmo and by bands he is producing and supporting.

==Influences==

Anselmo has a wide range of musical influences from classic rock to black metal. He was mainly influenced by bands such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Black Flag, Agnostic Front, Hellhammer and Venom, and singers Rob Halford, David Lee Roth, Dee Snider, Ronnie James Dio, Ozzy Osbourne, Roger Miret and Henry Rollins. He pays tribute to two of his favorite bands in the lyrics of the Pantera song &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot; from the album &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;, singing &quot;your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath&quot;; in the second verse, the lyric is tweaked to &quot;whiskey and weed and Slayer&quot;.
Anselmo stated that his main vocal influence had been Judas Priest singer Rob Halford before he decided to focus on the exploration of his own technique.

Anselmo mentioned that he is a massive fan of hardcore punk, especially &#x27;80s hardcore.

In 2016, Anselmo said the favorite of recent concerts he had attended included Morrissey, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Stevie Wonder. Wonder performed the entirety of his classic 1976 album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;, which Anselmo described as &quot;like watching a living, breathing miracle right before your eyes.&quot;

==Personal life==

On October 31, 2001, Anselmo married his longtime girlfriend, Stephanie Opal Weinstein. That same year, the couple created an all-acoustic duo called Southern Isolation and released an eponymous four-song EP.

As of 2011, Anselmo lives in rural Louisiana, and is in a relationship with Kate Richardson, who also helps with the running of his record label, Housecore Records. He is an atheist.

===Interests===
Anselmo owns a collection of several thousand horror films, and possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of horror films and horror culture. Together with Steve Joseph, Ross Karpelman, and Jay Gracianette, Anselmo started a Halloween-themed attraction called House of Shock. Initially it began in Jay Gracianette&#x27;s backyard, but was later moved to a large warehouse outside New Orleans that has been converted into an interactive haunted house with over three hundred volunteer workers. The attraction has raised money for the Children&#x27;s Hospital of New Orleans, the Parish Police Bullet Proof Vest Fund, and the Greater New Orleans Riding Rehabilitation Center. Anselmo played the role of a part-time actor when his schedule permitted, however Anselmo is no longer involved with House of Shock.

Anselmo has an interest in the sport of boxing. He owns hundreds of fight DVDs and used to take a boxing trainer on tour with him. He has written articles as a columnist for the &quot;Boxing Insider&quot; website. Also a fan of the NFL team New Orleans Saints, Anselmo has interviewed Saints player Jeremy Shockey and has helped to coach a youth team at the request of Saints team ambassador Michael Lewis during a visit to the team&#x27;s practice facility.

===Back injury and substance abuse===
According to Anselmo, he suffered constant pain due to a back injury he sustained in the mid-1990s. To alleviate the pain, he drank heavily, abused pills such as painkillers and muscle relaxants, and eventually became addicted to heroin. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s his drug abuse severely affected his onstage performance.

On July 13, 1996, Anselmo went into cardiac arrest due to a heroin overdose after a show at the Coca-Cola Starplex in Dallas, Texas. Paramedics revived him, and four days later, he issued a press release stating, &quot;I, Philip H. Anselmo [...] injected a lethal dose of heroin into my arm, and died for four to five minutes&quot;.

In 2005, Anselmo stopped using hard drugs, so that he could be cleared for surgery to repair back damage caused by degenerative disc disease, and has remained clean ever since. The surgery was successful, and after several months of recuperation and rehabilitation, he returned to recording and touring.

In November 2016, Anselmo reported that he had stopped drinking alcohol. Though he is &quot;pretty much an atheist&quot;, he nonetheless gave up alcohol during Lent earlier that year and &quot;kind of lost the taste for it&quot;.

===Racism controversy===
Anselmo has given some controversial statements about race, skin color, and culture throughout his life. At a Pantera concert in Montreal in 1995, he gave a speech expressing that &quot;Pantera are not a racist band&quot; and that he and his bandmates had friends &quot;of all colors and all kinds&quot;, but that he had a problem with rap artists &quot;pissing all over white culture&quot;. In another concert, he expressed his disgust with affirmative action, saying &quot;fuck all that Black Power bullshit&quot;.

Winda Benedetti of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; accused Anselmo of mouthing the words &quot;white power&quot; and making Nazi salutes at Superjoint Ritual&#x27;s performance at Ozzfest on July 27, 2004. Speaking with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Benedetti alleged that she was seated in the second row, and saw Anselmo lean down and mouth the words towards a crowd of skinheads at the front. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was unable to reach Anselmo for comment.

On January 22, 2016, an intoxicated Anselmo ended the &quot;Dimebash&quot; Dimebag Darrell tribute show by giving a Nazi salute and screaming the words &quot;white power&quot; to the crowd. The incident was captured by an audience member&#x27;s cell phone camera and the video was posted on YouTube. Anselmo later claimed that it was an in-jest reference to drinking white wine.

Despite initially refusing to apologize, he later retracted this statement and said it &quot;was ugly, it was uncalled for and anybody who knows me and my true nature knows that I don&#x27;t believe in any of that. I&#x27;m a thousand percent apologetic to anyone who took offense to what I said, cause you should&#x27;ve taken offense to what I said.&quot;

In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by &quot;two or three little hecklers&quot; who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, and by the end he had lost his patience. Of the show Anselmo said, &quot;When people start screaming &#x27;racist&#x27; over and over and over and over again at me, what I did was show them exactly what [...] the ugliest possible thing I could think of at the time was.&quot; He also noted that when Scott Ian asked him to donate to Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization, he did so immediately.

In January 2023, the reformed Pantera was dropped from the German Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals due to Anselmo&#x27;s past behavior. Pantera&#x27;s concert in Austria scheduled for May 31, 2023, was also canceled following an outcry over his previous remarks. Despite these incidents, Pantera are slated to play three shows in Germany in 2025 on their UK/EU 2025 tour.

<text>Michael Anthony &quot;Rizzo&quot; Eruzione (, , born October 25, 1954) is an American former ice hockey player. He is best known as the captain of the 1980 Winter Olympics United States national team that defeated the Soviet Union in the famous &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; game, in which he scored the game-winning goal. He is the author, with Neal E. Boudette, of the national bestseller, &quot;The Making of a Miracle: The Untold Story of the Captain of The Gold Medal-Winning 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team,&quot; published by HarperCollins.

==Biography==

===Early life and playing career===
Eruzione was born on October 25, 1954, to an Italian-American family in Winthrop, Massachusetts. His father was a bartender and worked in a sewage plant. Eruzione learned to play hockey for Youth Hockey of Winthrop as part of the GBYHL (Greater Boston Youth Hockey League). He graduated from Winthrop High School in 1972, where he was captain of the varsity hockey team during his senior year. He then spent a year at Berwick Academy to fine-tune his hockey skills in a New England Prep environment. After leaving Berwick, Eruzione attended Boston University. He had initially opted for another school, but he switched to Boston after his coach forgot his name. While at Boston, he averaged over twenty goals a season for four years. BU coach Jack Parker called Eruzione &quot;Pete Rose on skates&quot;.

Eruzione also played for Team USA at the 1975 and 1976 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments. He then spent two seasons with the Toledo Goaldiggers of the International Hockey League, being named the Rookie of the Year in 1978 and leading the team to the Turner Cup championship in that year. Prior to the 1979–80 season, Eruzione, who played left wing, rejoined the U.S. team and was later named Captain of the 1980 Olympic hockey squad, scoring the winning goal against the Soviets and helping the Americans win the gold medal against Finland. Eruzione&#x27;s winning goal against the Soviet Union has become one of the most played highlights in American sports, and was chosen by Sports Illustrated in 1999 as the greatest sports moment of the twentieth century. In March 2008, it was voted the greatest highlight of all time by ESPN viewers. In an HBO documentary about the 1980 Olympic hockey team, Eruzione said of his winning goal against the Soviet team, &quot;My friends always like to joke with me [about that goal], &#x27;Three more inches to the left, you&#x27;d been painting bridges.&#x27;&quot;

Due to Eruzione&#x27;s having played under contract for the Goaldiggers prior to the 1980 Olympics, his amateur status was later brought under question by NHL Players&#x27; Association director Alan Eagleson. Eruzione rebutted the charges, saying &quot;He&#x27;s trying to take something away from me that we so richly deserved. He can&#x27;t take away the memory. Is he going to try to convince everybody in the United States we lost?&quot;

===Post playing career===
Eruzione was one of five players on the US Olympic team not drafted by an NHL team. Initially, he voiced his interest in playing professionally, mentioning the &quot;New England Whalers&quot; (by that time, renamed as the Hartford Whalers) as a possibility. He retired from competition after the Olympics, despite contract offers from the New York Rangers, stating that he&#x27;d reached the pinnacle of achievement already. He was a technical consultant for the 1981 film &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, and said &quot;we all know the movie will never be able to equal what happened.&quot; Eruzione then became a television broadcaster, grabbing the microphone at Rangers and New Jersey Devils games and for the &quot;NHL on USA&quot; and &quot;NHL on Fox&quot;, and going on to comment at five Olympic Games, working for both ABC and CBS. Eruzione said that he did not regret deciding not to play professional hockey, saying &quot;after being a commentator and covering the NHL for a few years, I have no doubt I could play.&quot;

Eruzione returned to be the assistant coach for the hockey team for three seasons at his alma mater Boston University, where he currently works as Director of Special Outreach. He is a member of several halls of fame. He is a part-owner of the USHL Omaha Lancers, and a motivational speaker. He also helps the Winthrop High School ice hockey team during the winter.

In 2002, Eruzione reunited with his 1980 Olympic teammates to light the Olympic cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

On January 19, 2007, Eruzione appeared on the new version of the game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. His secret was that he was the captain of the 1980 U.S. Men&#x27;s Olympic hockey team, but he failed to stump the panel, as his secret was guessed by Billy Bean.

In 2012, the Lawrence Larsen Hockey Rink in Eruzione&#x27;s hometown of Winthrop, Massachusetts was renamed the Larsen Hockey Rink at the Mike Eruzione Center.

=== &quot;The Making Of A Miracle&quot; ===
On January 28, 2020, Eruzione&#x27;s book, &quot;The Making of a Miracle&quot;, was released by Harper, in imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. After its first week of sales, the book was No. 6 on the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; list of best-selling books, and No. 4 on the bestseller list of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. Like Eruzione, the book&#x27;s co-author, Neal Boudette, is a graduate of Boston University.

The book gives a detailed, inside account of U.S. Olympic hockey team&#x27;s path to the gold medal, including the upset of the Soviet Union in the &quot;Miracle On Ice&quot; game, as well as a portrait of Eruzione&#x27;s close-knit family and the experiences in college and minor league hockey that led him to try out for the Olympic team in 1979. Eruzione has said he wanted to write the book so that his grandchildren would know there was more to his life than scoring one goal in Lake Placid.

==In popular culture==
In the 1981 made-for-TV movie about the 1980 U.S. Hockey team called &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, Eruzione is portrayed by actor Andrew Stevens.

In the 2004 Disney film entitled &quot;Miracle&quot;, he is portrayed by actor Patrick O&#x27;Brien Demsey. Demsey had played hockey at Fitchburg State College, but he gave it up because of injuries and a desire to pursue an acting career. He saw the call for auditions the day before the auditions closed and won the part just days after his 24th birthday. To prepare for the role, he trained with the team Mike Eruzione coached at the time.

In the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;The Return of the Bling,&quot; Roger reveals that he was part of the 1980 U.S. hockey team, under his persona &quot;Chex LeMeneux.&quot; Stan does not believe him until Roger takes him to a team reunion at La Quinta Inns and Suites and Stan gets to see his team heroes Jim Craig, Mark Johnson and Eruzione. Eruzione provided his own voice for the episode.

In season four, episode 12 of the animated television show &quot;Archer&quot;, the main character, Sterling Archer responds to his mother&#x27;s exclamation, &quot;So then &quot;we&quot; will beat the Russians!&quot; with the retort, &quot;Give it up folks: Mike Eruzione!&quot;

Mike Eruzione was the presenter in the 1981 pilot of &quot;Starcade&quot;, a game show featuring video games.

===Politics===
Eruzione has supported both Democrats and Republicans, voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and Donald Trump in 2016. In 2012, Eruzione appeared at the Republican National Convention, and he gave a short speech in support of nominee Mitt Romney.

Along with thirteen teammates from the 1980 Lake Placid games, Eruzione received backlash when he appeared at a campaign rally for President Trump in Las Vegas in 2020. Several of the former players, including Eruzione himself, sported red Keep America Great hats. Eruzione said he was saddened by the controversy, stating &quot;I shake my head at it, that&#x27;s all I can say.&quot;
 He later said he regretted the appearance, noting that the team had only been invited to a private picture event and had not expected to appear onstage. On wearing the hat, he said, &quot;I just put it on. I wasn’t thinking. Maybe this shows I’m naive, shows I’m stupid. I don’t know. I don’t follow politics. I know [Trump] has had some issues and said a lot of things people don’t like.”

<text>The marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris) is a small North American songbird of the wren family. It is sometimes called the long-billed marsh wren to distinguish it from the sedge wren, also known as the short-billed marsh wren.

==Taxonomy==
The marsh wren was described by the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in 1810 and given the binomial name &quot;Certhia palustris&quot;. The current genus &quot;Cistothorus&quot; was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. There are 15 recognised subspecies.

Etymology: from Greek &#x27;κιστος&#x27; (&quot;cistos&quot;, &quot;a shrub&quot;) and &#x27;θουρος&#x27; (&quot;thouros&quot;, &quot;leaping, or running through&quot;) and Latin &#x27;palustris&#x27; (&quot;marshy&quot;).

==Description==
Adults have brown upperparts with a light brown belly and flanks and a white throat and breast. The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.

The male&#x27;s song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.

This little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is marshes with tall vegetation such as cattails across North America. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds migrate to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and Mexico. Their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

== Foraging and diet ==
These birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, also spiders and snails. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall.

== Nesting ==
The nest is an oval structure attached to marsh vegetation, entered from the side. The male builds many unused nests in his territory. A hypothesis of the possible reason to why males build multiple &quot;dummy&quot; nests in their territory is that they are courting areas and that the females construct the &quot;breeding nest&quot; in which she lays her eggs. He may puncture the eggs and fatally peck the nestlings of other birds nesting nearby, including his own species (even his own offspring) and red-winged blackbirds, yellow-headed blackbirds, and least bitterns. The clutch is normally four to six eggs, though the number can range from three to 10. The eggs are usually 0.6-0.7 inches in length and 0.4-0.6 inches in width. Incubation is performed only by females, and only females develop a brood patch. Marsh wren young can get infected by pathogenic larvae. The Blowfly larvae infect the young by subdermal myiasis-induced lesions and subsequent sepsis. The larvae form a wound in the young by rasping and expanding a hole in their skin to create blood flow and feed on the blood of the hosts&#x27; body.

== Conservation ==
The species is still common with an estimated global breeding population of 9.4 million. However, its numbers have declined with the loss of suitable wetland habitat and wholesale draining of marshes will lead to local extinction. Still, the species is widespread enough not to qualify as threatened according to the IUCN.

<text>Roy Fisher (11 June 1930 – 21 March 2017) was an English poet and jazz pianist. His poetry shows an openness to both European and American modernist influences, whilst remaining grounded in the experience of living in the English Midlands. Fisher has experimented with a wide range of styles throughout his long career, largely working outside of the mainstream of post-war British poetry. He has been admired by poets and critics as diverse as Donald Davie, Eric Mottram, Marjorie Perloff, Sean O’Brien, Peter Robinson, Mario Petrucci and Gael Turnbull.

==Life==

Roy Fisher was born in June 1930 at 74 Kentish Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, the home into which his parents had moved in 1919 and where they lived until their deaths. His mother Emma was 39 at the time of Fisher&#x27;s birth. A sister and a brother preceded him. His father (Walter Fisher) was a craftsman in the jewellery trade, and the family was &quot;poor and prudent&quot;. His parents had no political or religious affiliations, though his father was a chorister at a local church. Fisher describes the landscape of his childhood as ‘ugly’, the industrial sprawl of Smethwick to the south of Handsworth a place of danger. The grimy cityscape, the bomb damage of the war, and the industrial decline of the post-war years, these were all important influences on Fisher; but &quot;something called Nature&quot; was also present in his childhood, with excursions into the nearby countryside a regular aspect of family life.

Fisher went to Handsworth Grammar School. As a teenager he became interested in jazz and taught himself to play the piano. He was particularly influenced by a group of Chicago musicians including Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, and the pianist Joe Sullivan. By his late teens he was playing in public with local bands.

In 1948 he went to Birmingham University to read English. After graduating and qualifying as a teacher, he taught from 1953 at the grammar school in Newton Abbot, Devon, as part of a team engaged in a radical revision of English teaching methods. In the same year Fisher married artist Barbara Venables; they were to have two children. His son Ben was Head of French at University of Bangor, and creator of one of the world&#x27;s most popular narrow-gauge railway websites; his daughter Sukey is a screenwriter.

Returning to Birmingham in 1957, where he again worked as a jazz musician and began encountering, often late at night, the material that would prompt new poetry and prose, Fisher worked as a specialist Drama teacher in a primary school, moving to Dudley College of Education in 1958. In 1963 he was appointed to Bordesley College of Education in Birmingham as Principal Lecturer and Head of Department of English and Drama. In 1971 Fisher moved to Keele University where he taught in the Department of American Studies until 1982. After leaving Keele he continued to work as a writer and jazz musician, a second career he had sustained since the late 1950s playing with a number of his childhood heroes including Bud Freeman and Wild Bill Davison when they were touring Britain.

Fisher moved to Upper Hulme, Staffordshire Moorlands in 1982, and to Earl Sterndale in Derbyshire in 1986. In 1985 he was divorced from Barbara Venables Fisher, who died in 2007. His later life was characterised by bouts of depression and self-doubt, in spite of his increasing reputation and literary impact. In 1987 he married the playwright Joyce Holliday and outlived her by fifteen years. He died at home on 21 March 2017, aged 86.

==Work==

=== Early work ===
In 1954 Fisher had two short poems broadcast on the BBC by Charles Causley, and another published in a small press magazine &quot;The Window.&quot; The latter caught the eye of the poet Gael Turnbull who was putting together a British issue of the American magazine &quot;Origin&quot;, edited by Cid Corman, and he asked Fisher to contribute. Fisher and Turnbull became friends, and remained close until Turnbull&#x27;s death in 2004.

Turnbull introduced Fisher to the work of American modernist poets including William Carlos Williams, Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, and Louis Zukovsky, as well as to Basil Bunting, whom he met through Turnbull. Cid Corman also provided poetry tutorials by post. In these writers Fisher encountered an aesthetic that was serious and demanding. It was this rather than any stylistic mannerism he took from them.

Publication of Fisher&#x27;s work during his first ten years as a poet owed a great deal to Turnbull. Fisher&#x27;s first pamphlet &quot;City&quot; (1961) was published by Turnbull&#x27;s Migrant Press. The assemblage of verse and prose which makes up the text, was compiled from Fisher&#x27;s notebooks by Michael Shayer, Turnbull&#x27;s partner at Migrant. Fisher was dissatisfied with the pamphlet but it ‘caught people’s attention.’

A second pamphlet, &quot;Ten Interiors with Various Figures,&quot; was published by Tarasque Press in 1966, a surreal sequence of narrative poems some with quite short lines but many using a very long line close to prose. That same year Fisher also published &quot;The Ships Orchestra&quot; with Fulcrum Press, a long prose sequence again showing the influence of surrealism. The initial idea for the work came from Picasso&#x27;s ‘Three Musicians’. Fisher wrote this work sequentially, each new section generated out of the preceding material. The work grows organically, following no plot, and avoiding any sense of dramatic development. The writing is often very funny and can be viewed as a verbal equivalent of the cubist technique Picasso employs in the painting.

After these publications Fisher reached an impasse and, apart from fulfilling a commission to make performance-translations of three Schubert song-cycles, wrote nothing for 5 years. In 1968 when Fulcrum published &quot;Collected Poems,&quot; bringing together all of the work Fisher wished to preserve, the poet thought he would not write again.

=== The 1970s ===
Fisher emerged from this period of blocked creativity in 1971, composing a number of prose pieces and sequences of poems. ‘The Cut Pages’ is the most radical of these 1970s works and remains Fisher&#x27;s most challenging. The late sixties had been personally difficult years and Fisher kept a journal in which he recorded the ‘grisly’ details of his life. ‘The Cut Pages’ Fisher describes as an ‘exercise in self-permission’. He cut the blank pages from his notebook with a razor and started to write on them the ‘converse’ of what was in the journal – things ‘there was no constraint upon’. He continued writing until he had used up all the pages. The American critic Marjorie Perloff describes the poem as having affinities with Samuel Beckett and as an ‘unwitting precursor’ of the experiments of Ron Silliman and other Language poets a decade later. ‘The Cut Pages’ became the title sequence for a 1971 publication from Fulcrum that also contained a four further prose pieces.

&quot;Matrix&quot; was also published in 1971 by Fulcrum. The title sequence, ‘Matrix’, like a number of Fisher&#x27;s poems, draws upon painting, in this case Böcklin&#x27;s series of pictures called ‘The Isle of the Dead’ and Monet&#x27;s late paintings of waterlilies. This volume also includes ‘Glenthorne Poems’, ‘The Six Deliberate Acts,’ and a number of collaborations with visual artists. Two of his works, ‘Correspondence’ and ‘Metamorphoses’, were illustrated by Tom Phillips and published in 1970 by Tetrad, a small London press run by artist Ian Tyson. ‘Also’ a collaboration with artist Derrick Greaves was published by Tetrad in 1972, and the same year the artist Ronald King published &quot;Bluebeard’s Castle&quot; with text by Fisher. Other collaborations with King followed over a period of twenty-five years, mostly appearing as Artist&#x27;s Books and all issued by his Circle Press.

Fisher produced work steadily during the 1970s and published a further volume in 1978, &quot;The Thing About Joe Sullivan&quot;, this time with Carcanet. It was a Poetry Book Society Choice. The volume includes ‘Handsworth Liberties’, a sequence of sixteen poems written between 1974 and 1977. These poems recall images of the neighbourhood where he grew up. Fisher described the writing of these pieces as an attempt to ‘repel the invasion of landscape’ associated with childhood memories. ‘Wonders of Obligation’, composed 1979, marked a fresh development in Fisher&#x27;s work, one that combines a greater freedom of movement through the compositional elements, and a further fluency and directness in both evocation and comment.

=== &quot;A Furnace&quot; ===
In 1980 Oxford University Press published &quot;Poems 1955–1980,&quot; affording Fisher&#x27;s work a level of recognition it had not previously enjoyed. Six years later OUP published &quot;A Furnace&quot;, an ambitious book-length poem structured around the idea of a double spiral with a central section, ‘Core’, flanked by sections where passages move ‘in’ or ‘out’ from the core. An ‘Introit’ provides the background and context to the work. As with Fisher&#x27;s other work, it is a collage of images, but here drawn from a wide range of places and historical periods. In 1980 Fisher travelled outside of Britain for the first time and &quot;A Furnace&quot; includes references to a prehistoric burial site in Brittany, to Paris, Trier, Chicago and to Ampurias in Spain. Bunting&#x27;s &quot;Briggflatts&quot; is in some senses a model, though Fisher allows himself more space and the language is less compacted than in Bunting.

A further collection, &quot;Poems 1955–1987&quot;, was published by OUP in 1988, mainly collecting previous published work.

=== Later poems ===
In 1992 the poet and film maker Tom Pickard produced a documentary about Fisher with funding from the Arts Council called &quot;Birmingham’s What I Think With&quot;. Fisher wrote a sequence of poems for the film describing the city of his birth. These were published by OUP in 1994 along with other new work in a collection titled &quot;Birmingham River&quot;. The collaboration with Ronald King continued with &quot;Top Down Bottom Up&quot; published in 1989, and &quot;Anansi Company&quot; appearing in 1991. A pamphlet, &quot;It Follows That&quot;, issued by Pig Press, also appeared in 1994.

In 1996 Bloodaxe published &quot;Dow Low Drop: New and Selected Poems.&quot; Dow Low is a quarried-out hillside near Fisher&#x27;s home in Derbyshire. ‘Dow Low Drop’, and the poem ‘It Follows That’ republished here, both include sections of prose, a form Fisher had not used since the 1960s.

In an interview with Peter Robinson given in 1998 Fisher questions the idea that his work has gone through distinct periods of development, and the collected poems &quot;The Long and the Short of It&quot;, published by Bloodaxe in 2005, does not present the poems in a chronological sequence. In a note at the end of the book Fisher says: ‘my habits of working on projects from time to time over long periods and my heterodox approach to the methods I use would make an arrangement that seemed chronological false: so nothing of the kind is here attempted.’

A later collection, &quot;Standard Midland&quot;, was published in 2010 by Bloodaxe, and shortlisted that year for the Costa Poetry Award. The poems were incorporated into a revised edition of &quot;The Long and the Short of It&quot; (2012). &quot;Standard Midland&quot; includes poems in various styles from lighter pieces, to more characteristic work, including two enigmatic prose poems, and another of his collaborative pieces with Ronald King. A further volume, &quot;Slakki: New &amp; Neglected Poems&quot;, was published by Bloodaxe in October 2016.

== Critical reception ==
As early as 1962, Denise Levertov–in an article published in &quot;Kultur&quot;–singled Fisher out as one of the most promising young poets in Britain. His early poems appeared in several influential anthologies: Michael Horovitz’s &quot;Children of Albion&quot; (1969), Edward Lucie-Smith’s &quot;British Poetry Since 1945&quot; (1971) and Jon Silkin’s &quot;Poetry of the Committed Individual&quot; (1973) – all published by Penguin.

Fisher attracted the attention of a diverse range of critics and reviewers over the years. Eric Mottram, writing in &quot;Stand&quot; (1969–70) praised Fisher as an experimental modernist, while Donald Davie, in a chapter devoted to Fisher in &quot;Thomas Hardy and British Poetry&quot; (1973), claimed affinities with what he considered a native tradition. Peter Robinson has suggested that this kind of ‘dualism of approach’, with modernists and traditionalists both claiming Fisher as one of their own, has continued to the present. Fisher himself never sought to associate with any particular camp or school, and his writing during all periods of his career embraces a range of styles. Critics as diverse as Andrew Crozier, Sean O’Brien, and Marjorie Perloff have written in praise of Fisher, though from very different perspectives. This diversity of reception is certainly an issue that critics and reviewers have picked up in various ways and to various degrees, often highlighting the binary character of much of Fisher&#x27;s output: for instance, reviewing Fisher&#x27;s &#x27;Selected Poems&#x27; for &quot;Poetry&quot;, poet Daisy Fried noted of the poems: “Sometimes prose, sometimes lineated, they are dense except when they aren’t, restless except when still, improvisational in feel inside a kind of nonce formal rigor.”

Despite the quality of his work, Fisher never enjoyed the level of celebrity accorded to some of his contemporaries. Davie says that Fisher was a victim of &quot;the blindness and condescension of the metropolis to writing which is provincial in its origins or its subject matter&quot;. In interviews, Fisher described himself as being highly conscious of his provincial and class background. At the same time, Fisher never sought celebrity, being largely indifferent to the world of poetry prizes and media hype. While admired by many poets and dedicated poetry readers he remains largely unknown to a wider reading public.

&quot;News for the Ear: A Homage to Roy Fisher&quot; edited by Peter Robinson and Robert Sheppard appeared in 2000, as a tribute to the poet on his seventieth birthday. A volume of critical essays, &quot;The Thing About Roy Fisher&quot;, edited by John Kerrigan and Peter Robinson, was published the same year. A compendium of interviews with Fisher, &quot;Interviews Through Time&quot;, edited by Tony Fraser, also appeared in 2000, with an updated version issued in 2013.

In 2010, &quot;An Unofficial Roy Fisher&quot; edited by Peter Robinson was published in celebration of the poet&#x27;s eightieth birthday. This book includes work by Fisher not collected elsewhere, as well as tributes from other poets and commentary on his work. The work also includes an update to the invaluable bibliography published in &quot;The Thing About Roy Fisher,&quot; compiled by Derek Slade.

In 2003, Fisher was made lifetime Honorary Poet of the City of Birmingham. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2005 and was shortlisted for the 2012 Ted Hughes Award. He had already gained a Cholmondeley Award in 1981, and in 2010 poet and radio broadcaster Ian McMillan chose Fisher&#x27;s selected poems, &quot;The Long and the Short of It&quot;, as his Desert Island book, describing its author as &quot;Britain’s greatest living poet&quot;.

<doc id="432664" wikidata="Q335381" url="?curid=432664" title="George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie">
<text>General George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie, (23 October 1770 – 21 March 1838), styled Lord Ramsay until 1787, and Baron Dalhousie from 1815, was a Scottish soldier and colonial administrator. He was Governor of Nova Scotia from 1816 to 1820, Governor General of British North America from 1820 to 1828 and later Commander-in-Chief in India. In turn, his son, James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie, would later serve as Governor-General of India.

==Background and education==
Dalhousie was born at Dalhousie Castle, Midlothian, the son of George Ramsay, 8th Earl of Dalhousie, and Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Glen. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh.

==Military career==
After his father&#x27;s death in 1787, Dalhousie joined the British Army in July 1788 by purchasing a cornetcy in the 3rd Dragoons, and was later appointed to the captaincy of an independent company he himself had raised. He joined the 2nd battalion of the 1st Foot in January 1791, and purchased the rank of major in the 2nd Foot in June 1792. He travelled with the regiment to Martinique, as its commander, and succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy in August 1794. He was severely wounded in 1795 and returned to Britain. In 1798 he served in the Irish Rebellion, and in 1799 throughout the Flanders campaign. He received the brevet rank of colonel in January 1800, and fought in the later stages of the Egyptian campaign under Ralph Abercromby, capturing Rosetta without a fight and successfully investing the nearby Fort Julien in April 1801. In 1803 he served as a brigadier-general on the staff in Scotland, and was appointed Major-General in April 1805.

During the later stages of the Peninsular War Dalhousie commanded the 7th Division under the Duke of Wellington. Wellington was sometimes critical of his performance, as during the retreat from Burgos, because of his tardy arrival at Vitoria, and for his misinformation about French intentions shortly before the Battle of Roncesvalles.

With Henry Clinton (or Oswald) and William Stewart he displayed insubordination during the retreat from Burgos. Wellington ordered them down a certain road, but they decided it &quot;was too long and too wet and chose another. This brought them to a bridge which was blocked so that they could not cross. Here, eventually, Wellington found them, waiting. What, Wellington was asked, did he say to them? &#x27;Oh by God, it was too serious to say anything.&#x27; &#x27;What a situation is mine!’ he complained to London later. &#x27;It is impossible to prevent incapable men from being sent to the army.&#x27;&quot;.

At Vitoria he was delayed because he &quot;had found difficulty in marching through the broken country&quot;, though Thomas Picton arrived early enough and attacked in his stead when the 7th Division failed to appear

He was nevertheless voted the thanks of Parliament for his services at Vitoria where he commanded the Left Center Column, consisting of the 3rd and 7th Divisions. He was appointed lieutenant-general, and colonel of the 13th Foot in 1813. He led his division in the Battle of the Pyrenees where it was lightly engaged, then went home to England in October. After the previous commander was wounded at the Battle of Orthez in February 1814, Dalhousie briefly led the 7th Division again. He occupied the city of Bordeaux and thus missed the final Battle of Toulouse.

William Kemley was said to have saved the life of Ramsay in battle, by holding a flag over his body. In doing so he suffered a wound from a musket ball that left him with a permanent hole in the palm of his hand. His grandson, Peter Gordon Kemley, used to tell how he could put his finger through the palm of his grandfather&#x27;s hand. For his actions, William Kemley was given a house on the Dalhousie Estate at Brechin Castle, rent-free for life. His daughter, Caroline Kemley, was born under a gun carriage the evening before the Battle of Quatre Bras. Her mother was one of six wives per regiment permitted to accompany their husbands.

==Later career==

In 1815 he was created Baron Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle in Midlothian, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, to allow him to sit in the House of Lords by right (until that point he had sat as a Scottish representative peer).

===Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia===

According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Ramsay sought a position in colonial administration to pay debts he incurred expanding his estate. He replaced Sir John Coape Sherbrooke as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia in 1816. He is known to have employed an official draughtsman, John Elliott Woolford, known for many surviving drawings and paintings.

Ramsay created Dalhousie College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which grew into Dalhousie University.

===Governor-General of Canada===

He was appointed Governor-General of British North America in 1820 and held that position until 1828.

===Commander in Chief of India===
Dalhousie was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army in 1828. Army headquarters alternated between Calcutta and Simla. India taxed his health, and he resigned in 1832.

===Retirement===
Dalhousie suffered a &quot;fainting fit&quot; in February 1833. His health continued to deteriorate, and he returned to his estate, in 1834, where his health continued to deteriorate until his death 4 years later. He went both blind and senile in his final years.

==Family==
Lord Dalhousie married Christian, daughter of Charles Broun, of Colstoun in East Lothian, Scotland, a lady of gentle extraction and distinguished gifts, in 1805. She was recognised as a &quot;zealous botanist&quot; by leading scientists of her day.

Ramsay and Christian had three sons, the two elder of whom died early. He died at Dalhousie Castle in March 1838, aged 67, and was succeeded by his youngest son, James, who was later created Marquess of Dalhousie. Lady Dalhousie died in January 1839.

==Legacy==
While serving as Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia he founded Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The town of Dalhousie, New Brunswick was named after him when he visited there in 1826, although his diary entry for the day stated that he disapproved of changing the original French and Mi&#x27;kmaq location names. The villages of East and West Dalhousie in Nova Scotia are named after him, as are Earltown and Port Dalhousie, which is part of St. Catharines, Ontario, a community in Calgary Alberta, Dalhousie Station and an adjacent square, &quot;Dalhousie Square&quot; in Montreal.

<doc id="432672" wikidata="Q972705" url="?curid=432672" title="Charles Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton">
<text>Charles Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton (1661 – 21 January 1722) was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Member of Parliament for Hampshire and a supporter of William III of Orange.

==Life==
He was the son of Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton, and Mary Scrope, daughter of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland. From 1675 (when his father succeeded as Marquess of Winchester) until April 1689 (when his father was created 1st Duke of Bolton), he was styled Earl of Wiltshire. From 1689 until his succession to the Dukedom in 1699 he was styled Marquess of Winchester. In 1697 he commanded a Regiment of Hampshire Militia foot under his father, the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire.

He was later Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire himself and also of Dorset, a commissioner to arrange the union of England and Scotland, and was twice a lord justice of the kingdom. He was also lord chamberlain of the royal household and Governor of the Isle of Wight.

In Jonathan Swift&#x27;s tract &quot;Remarks on the Characters of the Court of Queen Anne&quot;, a commentary on the book &quot;Memoirs of the Secret Services&quot; by John Macky, in response to Macky&#x27;s statement that the Duke &quot;Does not now make any figure at court&quot;, Swift&#x27;s dismissive reply was, &quot;Nor anywhere else. A great booby&quot;.

== Marriages and children ==
Charles married three times:

*First, on 10 July 1679 to Margaret Coventry (14 September 1657 – 7 February 1681 or 1682); Margaret was the daughter of George Coventry, 3rd Baron Coventry, and Margaret Tufton. No children resulted from this marriage.
*Second on 8 February 1682 or 1683 to Frances Ramsden (baptised 14 June 1661 – 22 November 1696), daughter of William Ramsden and Elizabeth Palmes. They had five children:
**Lady Frances Powlett (baptised 20 October 1684 Chawton, Hants – d. 1715), married John Mordaunt, Viscount Mordaunt (d. 1710) in 1708.
**Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton (3 September 1685 – 26 August 1754).
**Lady Betty Charlotte (baptised 21 December 1686 at Chawton, Hampshire)
**Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Bolton (24 July 1691 – 9 October 1759). He married Catherine Parry (d. 25 April 1744). The marriage resulted in the birth of Charles Paulet, 5th Duke of Bolton, Harry Paulet, 6th Duke of Bolton and daughters Catherine Paulett and Henrietta Paulett.
**Lady Mary Powlett.
*Third, around 1697 to Henrietta Crofts (d. 27 February 1729 or 1730), a natural daughter of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth and Eleanor Needham. They had a son:
**Lord Nassau Powlett (d. 1741). He married Isabella Tufton, daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet and Lady Catherine Cavendish.

<text>Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton ( – 27 February 1699) was an English politician who represented Winchester and Hampshire in the House of Commons of England from 1660 to 1675. He was the son of John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester, and his first wife, Jane Savage.
==Career==
Paulet succeeded his father as the sixth Marquess of Winchester in 1675. He was MP for Winchester in 1660 and then for Hampshire from 1661 to 5 March 1675. Before his succession to the Marquessate he was styled Lord St John.

He held the following offices:
* Freeman, Winchester June 1660, Hartlepool 1670
* Justice of the Peace Hampshire July 1660-?d., Yorkshire (North Riding) 1664-?85, Surrey, Middlesex and Westminster 1671-?80, (East Riding) by 1680-85
* Commissioner for assessment, Hampshire August 1660–75, N. Riding 1663–75, West and East Ridings and County Durham 1673-5
* Commissioner for loyal and indigent officers, Hampshire 1662
* Lord Lieutenant Hampshire 1667–76, 1689-1699;
* Warden of the New Forest 1668–76, 1689-1699 
* High Steward, Winchester 1669-84 
* Custos rotulorum Hampshire 1670–6, 1689-1699 
* Keeper of King&#x27;s Lodge, Petersham 1671-?76 
* Commissioner for recusants, Hampshire 1675 
* Colonel of a Regiment of Hampshire Militia Foot and Troop of Horse by 1697-1699
* Privy Councillor 22 April 1679 – 1699
* Colonel of foot 1689-98

Having supported the claim of William and Mary to the English throne in 1688, he was restored to the Privy Council and to the office of Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, and was created Duke of Bolton on 9 April 1689. He built Bolton Hall, North Yorkshire in 1678.

==Character ==

An eccentric man, hostile to Lord Halifax and afterwards to the Duke of Marlborough, he is said to have travelled during 1687 with four coaches and 100 horsemen, sleeping during the day and giving entertainments at night. His adherence in adult life to the Church of England has been described as a great blow to the Roman Catholic community: his father (with whom his relationship was never good) had openly professed the Catholic faith, and used his wealth and influence to protect the Catholics of Hampshire.

In 1666 he briefly went into hiding after becoming involved in a public fracas in Westminster Hall with Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet. They fought in full view of the Court of Common Pleas, and were thus guilty of contempt coram rege. Both men in time received a royal pardon. Paulet, who admitted to striking the first blow, explained that he had been &quot;in a passion&quot; at the time. The precise cause of the quarrel is unknown. Samuel Pepys, who recorded the incident in the great Diary, remarked that it was a pity that Henley retaliated, for otherwise, the judges might have dealt with Paulet, of whom Pepys had a poor opinion, as he deserved. Despite his faults, his charm and affability made him numerous friends.

==Marriage and issue==
Charles Paulet married twice:

===First marriage===
He married as his first wife, 28 February 1652, Christian (13 December 1633 – 22 May 1653), daughter of John Frescheville, 1st Baron Frescheville of Staveley, Derbyshire and Sarah Harrington, and by her had a son:

<text>The SM-4 (CM-4) is a PDP-11/40 compatible system, manufactured in the Eastern Bloc in the 1980s. It was very popular in science and technology. They were manufactured in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Hungary, beginning in 1975.

The standard configuration includes 128 or 256 KB core memory, tape puncher, two RK-05 removable 2.5 MB disks and two RK-05F fixed disks, two TU-10 drives and Videoton VDT-340 terminals (VT52 non-compatible). The SM-4 processor operates at 900,000 operations per second.

The SM-series also includes the SM-3. The SM-3 lacks floating point processing, similar to DEC&#x27;s PDP 11/40 and 11/34 models. In early production, ferrite core memory is used. It operates at 200,000 operations per second in register-to-register operation.

Operating systems commonly used include:
* RT-11 (Rafos after partial translation)
* RSTS/E
* RSX-11
* DSM-11 (DIAMS after partial translations)
* DEMOS and MNOS

The SM-4 was manufactured in seven configurations, numbers SM-1401 through SM-1407.

Similar models include the SM-1420, with semiconductor memory, and the SM-1600, a hybrid of the SM-1420 and the M-6000, a system produced in Minsk.

The main producer of the SM-4 was Minpribor, at a facility in Kyiv, Ukraine, which began production in 1980.

<doc id="432680" wikidata="Q22575825" url="?curid=432680" title="Sedge wren">
<text>The sedge wren (Cistothorus stellaris) is a small and secretive passerine bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is widely distributed in North America. It is often found in wet grasslands and meadows where it nests in the tall grasses and sedges and feeds on insects. The sedge wren was formerly considered as conspecific with the non-migratory grass wren of central and South America.

== Taxonomy ==
The sedge wren was described by the German ornithologist Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1823 under the binomial name &quot;Troglodytes stellaris&quot;. The type locality is Carolina. The current genus &quot;Cistothorus&quot; was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. The sedge wren and the grass wren were formerly treated as conspecific. They were split based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014. The sedge wren is monotypic.

The sedge wren was formerly known as the short-billed marsh wren but was renamed to better distinguish it from the marsh wren.

== Description ==
The sedge wren is a relatively small wren that measures , weighs and has a wing-chord of . Wingspan ranges from 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm).

Females and males have the same plumage but males are slightly larger. Their head and back are tawny brown streaked with black and white. They have a pale buff supercilium and brown irises. Their rump is orange and tail is tawny brown bared with black. Wings are tawny brown bared with black, white and pale buff. They have a white throat and belly with pale buff on the side. Their beak is long and slender. and measures on average 6.77 to 6.95 mm The upper mandible of the beak is brown while the lower mandible is yellow. They have pink legs and feet. Juveniles are overall similar to adults but have less streaking on the head and nape and their chest is paler than adults. The sedge wren can be differentiated from the similar marsh wren &quot;(Cistothorus palustris&quot;) by its smaller size, streaked crown and different song.

== Distribution and habitat ==

=== Distribution ===
During the breeding season they are found in the southern half of Alberta and Saskatchewan and in southern Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in the United States, west of the Appalachians, from the Canadian border to Missouri and northern Arkansas. During migration and winter they are found from the southern half of Arkansas down to Texas and Florida.
=== Habitat ===
During the breeding season, sedge wrens generally occupy meadows and wet grasslands. They can however live in wetter areas such as marshes and dryer habitat such as dry prairies. They prefer areas with dense and tall grasses and sedges to build their nests.

During winter, migratory sedge wrens can be found in a variety of habitat as long as there are sufficient insects to eat. For example, they can be found in pine savannas, dry prairies, meadows, marshes, and bogs.

== Behavior ==

=== Vocalizations ===
Songs usually last 1.5 to 2 seconds and start with 3 to 4 high notes or staccato chips followed by a series of thrills. While both male and females can produce calls, only the males sing. Males sing from late winter to early spring on non-breeding grounds and throughout the breeding season to attract mates. They sing both during the day and the night. While males usually sing to attract females, they can also engage in countersinging, where a male will respond to another male&#x27;s song. A male will usually answer the other male with a different song type and frequently change song types during the interaction. Both males also usually sing faster during countersinging. It is hypothesized that they do so to send the maximum amount of stimuli to the listener whether it be a male or a potential mate.

==== Improvisation ====
Sedge wrens improvise their songs rather than learning them from other birds. Lab and field observations demonstrated that males had large ranges of individually unique songs and that their songs were poor imitations of the same template songs. There was also very little song sharing among males. This large variation results from the tendency of North American sedge wrens to move often. North American sedge wrens are nomadic breeders compared to their sedentary central and South American relatives. They breed where moist meadows and grasslands are available and they may not return to the same locations the next year if conditions are not right. Furthermore, adult birds may switch locations after raising their first brood to go to wetter areas. There is thus a lot of movement and mixing of populations and birds rarely have the same neighbor twice. Therefore, there is no selection for a precise imitation of the neighboring birds and variations arise in the males&#x27; songs. Moreover, because their songs vary so much naturally, it decreases the overall variation over large geographic scales and wrens from all over North America can communicate with each other regardless of which population they came from.

=== Diet ===
Sedge wren forage on the ground for insects and spiders. They eat many types of insects such as moths, flies and grasshoppers.

=== Migration ===
Sedge wrens are short-distance and nocturnal migrants. They leave their wintering grounds between early April and mid-May and usually arrive at their breeding grounds between mid-April and mid-May. They will typically leave their breeding grounds when frost reduces significantly the abundance of insects. They depart anywhere from August in the northern part of their range to the end of October in the central states to arrive in their wintering grounds starting in early September.

==== Dual breeding migration ====
There is some evidence that some sedge wrens may go through a second migration during the breeding season to breed at a second location. Sedge wrens were observed arriving and breeding from mid to late summer in the Central Plains of the United States and in Iowa where they were previously absent in early summer. It is however not actually known if these birds bred somewhere else before. There are several hypotheses to explain this potential second migration. One hypothesis is that these birds are coming from the northern part of their range where shorter summers prevents them from having a second in the same location. Another similar hypothesis is that these birds come from various locations where the environmental conditions changed and were no longer suitable for raising a second brood. A final hypothesis is that males that were not able to breed at their previous location relocate to the central plains. They will then wait for the arrival of females that are relocating and try to breed with them.

=== Reproduction ===
Some males are polygynous while others are monogamous. Polygynous males are usually more successful than monogamous males because breeding with multiple females increases their number of offspring. Males arrive earlier than females at breeding sites to establish territories and the ones defending territories with more nesting sites and food usually attract more females. Males are also the ones building the nests. They build multiple nests which serve for nesting, as dormitories and as decoys for predators. The females will then add a lining of grass, sedge and feathers to the nest she chooses. Nests are round globes of dried grass with a round opening on the side. They are usually built in grasses and sedges about one or two feet above ground or shallow water. Females usually lay seven eggs but it can vary from one to ten eggs which she incubates for 12–16 days. The eggs are oval shaped with no markings and measure on average . The young hatchlings are altricial. The females do most of the parental care and feeding whilst the males continue to build nests and display for other females. However, males will also occasionally feed the young. The young leave the nest after 11–16 days. Some early breeding females can also have a second brood later in the season.

<text>Lucy Walter (c. 1630 – 1658), also known as Lucy Barlow, was the first mistress of King Charles II of England and mother of James, Duke of Monmouth. During the Exclusion Crisis, a Protestant faction wanted to make her son heir to the throne, fuelled by the rumour that the king might have married Lucy, a claim which he denied.

==Life==

=== Ancestry and early life ===
Lucy Walter was born into minor Welsh gentry as the daughter of William Walter (died 1650) and his wife, born Elizabeth Prothero (died 1652), daughter of John Prothero and niece of John Vaughan, 1st Earl of Carbery. She was probably born in 1630 at her family&#x27;s home, Roch Castle near Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales, and had two brothers, Richard and Justus. She received no formal education but learned etiquette.

As her parents had a strained relationship, they separated in 1640 when Walter was 10 years old. She, her mother and her brothers went to live with her maternal grandmother in London. She may have first met the Sidney family, who held the earldom of Leicester, here through her maternal family members. In 1647, when Walter was 17, after a long legal battle between her parents, the House of Lords ordered her and her brothers to live with their father, as their mother could no longer afford to keep them.

Politician Algernon Sidney (1623–1683), son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester later stated that he had purchased the sexual services of Walter for 40 or 50 gold coins, but was called away to military services and missed out on his bargain. Walter then sailed to the Dutch Republic, either alone or with her uncle, to join the exiled court of Charles, Prince of Wales in The Hague, hoping to find a lover among the many young aristocrats there. She briefly became the mistress of Robert Sidney, brother of Algernon Sidney.

=== Relationship with Charles II ===

In May 1648, Walter managed to meet and charm Prince Charles, who had by then been living in France but visited The Hague for a short time. They were both only 18, and it is usually assumed that she was his first mistress. They might have resumed their relationship in September 1648, when he was again in the Dutch Republic. On 9 April 1649, Walter gave birth to a son, James (1649–1685), who was acknowledged by Prince Charles as his illegitimate child. The child was sent away to a wet nurse near Rotterdam, while Walter went to live in Antwerp.

In August 1649, Walter travelled to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France to see Charles, who had become king in January after the execution of his father, Charles I. She shared a coach with writer and diarist John Evelyn, who described their encounter.

During July and August 1649 she stayed with Charles in Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and she may have accompanied him to Jersey in September. It was around this time that she started using the name of her relative, John Barlow of Slebech.

=== Later life ===

In June 1650, Charles left for Scotland. There was an attempt to kidnap Walter&#x27;s son, who was missing for 10 days but was eventually found. Her mother took him to Paris for his safety, where she had an affair with Theobald Taaffe, 2nd Viscount Taaffe (later 1st Earl of Carlingford; circa 1603–1677). On 6 May 1651, she gave birth to a daughter, Mary, whose father was probably the Viscount Taaffe. After the Battle of Worcester in late 1651, Charles escaped from England and returned to the Dutch Republic. This time, he made it clear to Walter that their relationship was over, which she could not accept. For the next four years, she was involved in one scandal after another, causing much embarrassment to the exiled royal court. During this time, she considered marrying Sir Henry de Vic, 1st Baronet (circa 1599–1671), which eventually came to nothing. She then returned to The Hague and became the mistress of Thomas Howard, brother of the 3rd Earl of Suffolk.

In early 1656, when she was in Cologne, some of the king&#x27;s friends persuaded her to return to England by giving her cash and a pearl necklace and promising her a yearly allowance of £400. She went to live in London with Lord Thomas, her children and a maid, Ann Hill. They lived over a barber shop near Somerset House. She was suspected of being a spy, and at the end of June 1656, she and Hill were arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. After interrogation, they were released in July and deported back to the Dutch Republic. By this time, Lord Thomas had left her and she had no money to feed her children, as King Charles was unable to pay her allowance. She threatened him with releasing his letters to the public if he did not pay. The king, wanting custody of their eight-year-old son, attempted to kidnap him in December 1657, and succeeded at capturing him in March 1658. James was then sent to Paris and placed in the care of William, Lord Crofts, whose surname he started using.

Soon, Walter also moved to Paris. She was dying from a venereal disease. She made a General Confession of her life to John Cosin, future Bishop of Durham, insisting that she had married King Charles. She allegedly gave proof of this to Cosin, which he kept in a black box. This box was then supposedly inherited by Sir Gilbert Gerard, Cosin&#x27;s son-in-law. Walter died between 29 August and December 1658 and was probably buried in the Huguenot cemetery in the Faubourg Saint-German district of Paris. After his restoration to the throne, King Charles took their son James to England and created him Duke of Monmouth. Because of his complicated childhood, James never learned to read and write properly.

==Aftermath during the Exclusion Crisis==
The marriage of King Charles and Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705) did not produce legitimate children, leaving his brother, James, Duke of York (1633–1701) as heir to the throne. The duke was Catholic, and many people wanted a Protestant monarch. Rumours spread that the king had married Lucy Walters, making the Duke of Monmouth legitimate.

Sir Gilbert Gerard, who supposedly had the box containing proof of the marriage was summoned before the Privy Council in January 1678, and testified that he knew nothing of the proof. The king also denied the marriage. After King Charles&#x27; death in 1685, the Duke of York became king as James II, and the Duke of Monmouth started a rebellion against him, which was crushed in the Battle of Sedgemoor. The duke was beheaded.

== Issue ==
Lucy Walter had two children:

* By Charles II of England (1630–1685):
** James Scott, Duke of Monmouth (9 April 1649, Rotterdam – 15 July 1685, London), who married Lady Anne Scott (1651–1732) and had issue;
* Probably by Theobald Taaffe, 1st Earl of Carlingford (1603–1677):
# Mary Crofts (born 6 May 1651, The Hague), who married first William Sarsfield (died 1675) and had issue, and second William Fanshawe (died 1708), with whom she also had issue.

==In popular culture==
* Her descendant, Lord George Scott, published a biography called &quot;Lucy Walter Wife or Mistress&quot;. London: George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd, 1947.
* The novelist Elizabeth Goudge published a novel about Lucy, &quot;The Child from the Sea&quot;, in 1970.
* In the 2003 television documentary, &quot;The Boy Who Would Be King&quot;, Sandra Darnell portrays Lucy Walter.

<text>Puniša Račić (; 12 July 1886 – 16 October 1944) was a Serb leader and People&#x27;s Radical Party (NRS) politician. He assassinated Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) representatives Pavle Radić and Đuro Basariček and mortally wounded HSS leader Stjepan Radić in a shooting which took place on the floor of the Yugoslav parliament on 20 June 1928. He was tried and handed a 60-year sentence, which was immediately reduced to twenty years. He served most of his sentence under house arrest and was killed by the Yugoslav Partisans in October 1944.

==Early life and political career==
Puniša Račić was born on 12 July 1886 in the village of Slatina, near Andrijevica, Principality of Montenegro. He entered the employ of politician Nikola Pašić as a sixteen-year-old in 1902. Pašić regarded Račić as a son and encouraged his political ambitions. Račić became active in Serbian nationalist circles and claimed to have organized assassination attempts against King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, King Constantine I of Greece and Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. Following World War I, he earned a reputation for suppressing pro-Bulgarian movements in Macedonia. He was one of many Chetnik leaders who formed Serbian cultural societies in the region. On 27 September 1927, he was elected to the parliament of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a representative of the People&#x27;s Radical Party (NRS).

Račić is reported to have had connections with the ruling Karađorđević dynasty. He was the leader of the &quot;Association of Serbian Chetniks &quot;Petar Mrkonjić&quot; – For King and Fatherland&quot; until 1928. The movement was established following a split in the Chetniks in 1924 and built up a vast network across Bosnia and Herzegovina in the ensuing years. It maintained a close relationship with the Serbian National Youth (, SRNAO).

==Parliament shooting==
On 19 June 1928, Račić and twenty-three of his colleagues requested that Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) leader Stjepan Radić be examined by doctors to determine if he was mentally ill and, if it was discovered that he was not, that he be punished to the maximum extent for describing several Serbian ministers as &quot;plunderers&quot;, &quot;bandits&quot; and &quot;outlaws&quot; and thus violating the parliament&#x27;s rules of procedure. At that day&#x27;s session of parliament, Račić and fellow Serbian radical Toma Popović shouted: &quot;Heads are going to roll here and until someone kills Stjepan Radić there can be no peace.&quot; The atmosphere that day prompted Radić to remark that &quot;a psychological mood for murder&quot; was being created. Several individuals in Serbia had made death threats against Radić in the preceding days. The Croatian People&#x27;s Party (, HPS), which stood opposed to Radić&#x27;s anti-Clericalism and pan-Slavic ideas, also called for his removal from public life. Serbian newspapers such as &quot;Politika&quot; (Politics), &quot;Samouprava&quot; (Self-administration) and &quot;Jedinstvo&quot; (Unity) demonized Croat politicians, including Radić, and called for their murder.

Out of caution, Radić was quieter than usual at the following evening&#x27;s session of parliament. A verbal confrontation erupted that night when HSS deputy Ivan Pernar shouted insults at several Serbian politicians, questioning their wartime record and suggesting they were responsible for committing atrocities. Croatian politician Lubomir Maštović then made a speech protesting how the death threats against Radić made by Popović and Račić the previous day had gone unpunished by the president of the Assembly, Ninko Perić. Popović responded by saying &quot;...if Stjepan Radić, who shames the Croatian people, further continues with his insults, I guarantee that his head will fall.&quot; The opposition benches reacted by shouting insults and death threats at the NRS party deputies, who responded in similar fashion. Perić ordered a five-minute recess and retreated to his private chamber, where he spoke with Račić. Račić was given the floor when the session was resumed. In his speech, he asserted that Serbian interests had never been in greater danger and stated that he would not refrain from using &quot;other weapons, as need be, to defend the interests of Serbdom&quot;. Opposing politicians, especially Pernar, responded by taunting Račić and shouting as he spoke. Račić demanded that Perić penalize those jeering at his speech. Pernar then shouted &quot;you plundered beys!&quot;, accusing Račić of looting Muslim homes in Macedonia. Seeing that Perić was not going to reprimand Pernar, Račić reached into his pocket and produced a handgun. The Minister of Justice, Milorad Vujičić, who was sitting behind the podium, grabbed Račić by the back while the former Minister of Religion, Obradović, seized his right shoulder. Račić pushed both men away and shot Pernar first. He then turned his attention to Ivan Granđa and shot him. He attempted to shoot Svetozar Pribićević just as HSS deputy Đuro Basariček jumped to the podium. Račić aimed at Pribićević but shot Basariček instead. He then shot Radić in the hand and stomach. Radić&#x27;s nephew, Pavle, rushed to help his uncle. Upon seeing him, Račić yelled &quot;I was waiting for you!&quot; and shot him at point-blank range. He then fled the chamber. Basariček and Radić&#x27;s nephew died immediately. Pernar and Granđa were wounded but survived. Radić was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital immediately, where he was visited by King Alexander I.

===Aftermath===
Demonstrations erupted in Zagreb at the news of the shooting. Five people were killed and many more were wounded in clashes with police in the ten days following the attack. Deputies from the HSS–Democratic Party coalition withdrew from the parliament in protest. The shooting was the most significant political murder of Croat politicians during the inter-war period. It destroyed popular support for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Croatia. On 4 August Vlada Ristović, the editor of &quot;Jedinstvo&quot;—one of the newspapers which had called for the murder of Radić and Pribićević—was assassinated by Josip Sunić, a member of the youth wing of the Croatian Party of Rights (, HSP).

Radić was operated on shortly after he was shot and his surgeon predicted that he would recover. Within two months of the shooting, his condition deteriorated unexpectedly and he died on 8 August 1928. Vladko Maček, Radić&#x27;s successor as head of the HSS, suggested that diabetes had led to an infection which caused his heart to fail and suggested this as his cause of death. A week before his death, Radić had alleged that Račić was only the executor of &quot;a plot conceived of and agreed to in one part of the Radical [parliamentary] club&quot; and stated that his shooting had likely occurred with the knowledge and approval of Perić and Prime Minister Velimir Vukićević.

Račić was celebrated as a hero through much of Serbia. He turned himself into the authorities shortly after the shooting and was tried and sentenced to 60 years in prison. This was immediately reduced to 20 years. His shooting of HSS deputies led to King Alexander suspending the Vidovdan Constitution on 6 January 1929, renaming the country to Yugoslavia and proclaiming a royal dictatorship.

==Later life and death==
Račić spent most of his sentence under house arrest in a comfortable villa, where he was attended by three servants and was free to enter and leave at will. The leniency of his sentence likely came as a result of his connection with the Chetniks. He was released from house arrest on 27 March 1941. The Ustaše used Račić&#x27;s shooting of Croatian deputies as one of their excuses for Genocide of Serbs in the persecuting and massacring Serbs during World War II. Račić was killed by the Yugoslav Partisans on 16 October 1944 during the liberation of Belgrade from the Axis powers.

<text>The SM-1420 (CM-1420) is a 16 bit DEC PDP-11/45 minicomputer clone, and the successor to SM-4 in Soviet Bloc countries. Under the direction of Minpribor it was produced in the Soviet Union and Bulgaria from 1983 onwards, and is more than twice as fast as its predecessor. Its closest western counterpart is the DEC PDP-11/45, which means that the Soviet technology trailed 11 years behind compared to the Digital Equipment Corporation equivalent machine.

The standard package includes 256 KiB MOS memory, two RK-06 disks, two TU-10 decks, CM-6315 barrel or DZM-180 dot-matrix printer from Mera Blonie (Poland), VT52 compatible or VTA-2000-15 (BTA 2000-15) VT100 compatible terminals from Mera Elzab.

<doc id="432691" wikidata="Q1242529" url="?curid=432691" title="Philia">
<text>Philia (; ) is one of the four ancient Greek words for love: &quot;philia&quot;, &quot;storge&quot;, &quot;agape&quot; and &quot;eros&quot;. In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, philia is usually translated as &quot;friendship&quot; or affection. The complete opposite is called a phobia.

== Aristotle&#x27;s view ==
As Gerard Hughes points out, in Books VIII and IX of his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; Aristotle gives examples of philia including:

All of these different relationships involve getting on well with someone, though Aristotle at times implies that something more like actual liking is required. When he is talking about the character or disposition that falls between obsequiousness or flattery on the one hand and surliness or quarrelsomeness on the other, he says that this state:

This passage indicates also that, though broad, the notion of philia must be mutual, and thus excludes relationships with inanimate objects, though philia with animals, such as pets, is allowed for (see 1155b27–31) though it considers its existence in the way of inanimate objects could also &quot;inanimately love&quot;.

In his &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle defines the activity involved in philia (τὸ φιλεῖν) as:

John M. Cooper argues that this indicates:

Aristotle takes philia to be both necessary as a means to happiness (&quot;no one would choose to live without friends even if he had all the other goods&quot; [1155a5–6]) and noble or fine (καλόν) in itself.

==Types==
Aristotle divides friendships into three types, based on the motive for forming them: friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure and friendships of the good.

Friendships of utility are relationships formed without regard to the other person at all. Buying merchandise, for example, may require meeting another person but usually needs only a very shallow relationship between the buyer and seller. In modern English, people in such a relationship would not even be called friends, but acquaintances (if they even remembered each other afterwards). The only reason these people are communicating is in order to buy or sell things, which is not a bad thing, but as soon as that motivation is gone, so goes the relationship between the two people unless another motivation is found. Complaints and quarrels generally only arise in this type of friendship.

At the next level, friendships of pleasure are based on pure delight in the company of other people. People who drink together or share a hobby may have such friendships. However, these friends may also part—in this case if they no longer enjoy the shared activity, or can no longer participate in it together.

Friendships of the good are ones where both friends enjoy each other&#x27;s characters. As long as both friends keep similar characters, the relationship will endure since the motive behind it is care for the friend. This is the highest level of philia, and in modern English might be called true friendship.

:Now it is possible for bad people as well [as good] to be friends to each other for pleasure or utility, for decent people to be friends to base people, and for someone with neither character to be a friend to someone with any character. Clearly, however, only good people can be friends to each other because of the other person himself; for bad people find no enjoyment in one another if they get no benefit. (1157a18–21)

Not all bonds of philia involves reciprocity Aristotle notes. Some examples of these might include love of father to son, elder to younger or ruler to subject. Generally though, the bonds of philia are reciprocal and even symmetrical.

==Self-sufficiency==

Aristotle recognizes that there is an apparent conflict between what he says about &quot;philia&quot; and what he says elsewhere (and what is widely held at the time) about the self-sufficient nature of the fulfilled life:

He offers various answers. The first is based on the inherent goodness of acting for and being concerned for others (&quot;the excellent person labours for his friends and for his native country, and will die for them if he must&quot; [1169a19–20]); thus, being a wholly virtuous and fulfilled person necessarily involves having others for whom one is concerned—without them, one&#x27;s life is incomplete:

Aristotle&#x27;s second answer is: &quot;good people&#x27;s life together allows the cultivation of virtue&quot; (1170a12). Finally, he argues that one&#x27;s friend is &quot;another oneself&quot;, and so the pleasure that the virtuous person gets from his own life is also found in the life of another virtuous person. &quot;Anyone who is to be happy, then, must have excellent friends&quot; (1170b19).

==Altruism and egoism==
For Aristotle, in order to feel the highest form of philia for another, one must feel it for oneself; the object of philia is, after all, &quot;another oneself&quot;. This alone does not commit Aristotle to egoism, of course. Not only is self-love not incompatible with love of others, but Aristotle is careful to distinguish the sort of self-love that is condemned (ascribed to &quot;those who award the biggest share in money, honours, and bodily pleasures to themselves. For these are the goods desired and eagerly pursued by the many on the assumption that they are best&quot; [1168b17–19]) from that which should be admired (ascribed to one who &quot;is always eager above all to perform just or temperate actions or any other actions in accord with the virtues, and in general always gains for himself what is fine [noble, good]&quot; [1168b25–27]). In fact:

Aristotle also holds, though, that, as Hughes puts it: &quot;[t]he only ultimately justifiable reason for doing anything is that acting in that way will contribute to a fulfilled life.&quot; Thus acts of &quot;philia&quot; might seem to be essentially egoistic, performed apparently to help others, but in fact intended to increase the agent&#x27;s happiness. This, however, confuses the nature of the action with its motivation; the good person doesn&#x27;t perform an action to help a friend because it will give her fulfillment; she performs it in order to help the friend, and in performing it makes both her friend and herself happy. The action is thus good both in itself and for the effect it has on the agent&#x27;s happiness.

<text>Rude boy is a subculture that originated from 1960s Jamaican street culture. In the late 1970s, there was a revival in England of the terms &quot;rude boy&quot; and &quot;rude girl&quot;, among other variations like &quot;rudeboy&quot; and &quot;rudebwoy&quot;, being used to describe fans of two-tone and ska. This revival of the subculture and term was partially the result of Jamaican immigration to the UK and the so-called &quot;Windrush&quot; generation. The use of these terms moved into the more contemporary ska punk movement as well. In the UK and especially Jamaica, the terms &quot;rude boy&quot; and &quot;rude girl&quot; are used in a way similar to gangsta, yardie, or badman.

==Jamaica==
The term &quot;rude boy&quot;, and the rude boy subculture, arose from the poorer sections of Kingston, Jamaica, and was associated with violent discontented youths. Along with ska and rocksteady music, many rude boys favored sharp suits, thin ties, and pork pie or Trilby hats, showing an influence of the fashions of US jazz musicians and soul music artists. It is also believed that the rude boy style was influenced by Sean Connery&#x27;s sharp, tight suits worn when he portrayed James Bond, testified to by several ska songs that made reference to James Bond. Well-known cowboy and gangster/outlaw films from that period were also influential factors in shaping the rude boy image, as scholars like Rob Wilson, Christopher Leigh Connory, and Deborah A. Thomas have shown. In that time period, unemployed Jamaican youths sometimes found temporary employment from sound system operators to disrupt competitors&#x27; dances (leading to the term dancehall crasher). The violence that sometimes occurred at dances and its association with the rude boy lifestyle gave rise to a slew of releases by artists who addressed the rude boys directly with lyrics that either promoted or rejected rude boy violence, for example the 1967 song &quot;Rudy a Message to You&quot; by Dandy Livingstone.

Starting in the 1970s, Jamaican reggae music replaced the ska and rocksteady music associated with the rude boys. In the 1980s, dancehall became the main Jamaican popular music genre, drawing some parallels with the earlier rude boys in its culture and lyrical content.

==United Kingdom==
In the 1960s, the Jamaican diaspora introduced rude boy music and fashion to the United Kingdom, which influenced the mod and skinhead subcultures. In the late 1970s, the term &quot;rude boy&quot; and rude boy fashions came back into use after the 2 tone band the Specials (notably with a cover of &quot;A Message to You Rudy&quot;) and their record label 2 Tone Records instigated a brief but influential ska revival. In this same spirit, the Clash contributed &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot; on their 1979 album &quot;London Calling&quot;, and The Ruts their 1980 single &quot;Staring at the Rude Boys&quot;. In more recent times in multicultural Britain, the term &quot;rudeboy&quot; has become associated with street or urban culture, and is a common greeting. The term &quot;rudeboy&quot; has become associated with music genres such as ragga, jungle, drum and bass, UK garage, and grime – although is still used by many ska and ska punk bands, old and new – predominantly in the UK and USA.

<doc id="432696" wikidata="Q154543" url="?curid=432696" title="D12">
<text>D12 (an initialism for the Dirty Dozen) is an American hip hop group from Detroit, Michigan. Formed in 1996, the group achieved mainstream success with its lineup of &quot;de facto&quot; leader Eminem, Proof, Bizarre, Kon Artis, Kuniva and Swifty McVay.

D12 had chart-topping albums in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia during the early 2000s. The group released the albums &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; in 2001 and &quot;D12 World&quot; in 2004, spawning numerous hits such as &quot;Shit on You&quot;, &quot;Purple Pills&quot;, &quot;Fight Music&quot;, &quot;My Band&quot; and &quot;How Come&quot; throughout that period. Both albums were certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In 2004, the group won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Act.

Since 2006, Eminem&#x27;s hiatus and the death of Proof resulted in the group being less active in subsequent years. Between 2008 and 2015, D12 released three official mixtapes with the core lineup reduced to Bizarre, Kuniva and Swifty McVay, with isolated token appearances by Eminem and some contributions from Mr. Porter (formerly Kon Artis) and returning &#x27;90s affiliate Fuzz Scoota.

On August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, containing a song titled &quot;Stepping Stone&quot;, on which he declared that &#x27;D12 is over,&#x27; indicating his formal retirement from the group after many years of inactive membership. Bizarre, Kuniva and Swifty have continued to tour and record as D12.

==History==
===Early career, &quot;The Underground EP&quot; and death of Bugz (1996–2000)===
D12 was initially formed in 1996 by Proof who invited local Detroit rappers such as Bizarre, Da Brigade members Kon Artis and Kuniva, and Bugz. The name of the band was conceived as, despite having six members, each member had an alter ego they displayed in their music, which meant that there were 12 personalities. In 1997, they released their debut extended play, &quot;The Underground EP&quot;, which was recorded between 1996 and 1997. Eminem and Eye-Kyu had guest appearances on it. In 1997 and 1998, its members began establishing reputations locally. Bizarre was named &quot;Inner City Entertainment&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Flava of the Week&quot; and went on to release an EP, &quot;Attack of the Weirdos&quot;. Along with Eminem, he became an honorary member of the Outsidaz. Proof won a freestyling competition run by &quot;The Source&quot;.

In 1999, Bugz released &quot;These Streets EP&quot;, and made several appearances on other rappers&#x27; songs. On May 21, 1999, Bugz was shot and killed. One of his final acts had been a request that Swifty McVay join the group. Eminem volunteered to replace Bugz; this led to him joining the group.

===&quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;D12 World&quot; and death of Proof (2001–2006)===
Their debut album, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;, referring to the tradition of setting unoccupied buildings on fire the night before Halloween, was released in June 2001. It debuted at number one on the U.S. and number two on the UK chart, also reaching the top of the Canadian charts. The album went on to sell four million albums worldwide and two million in the U.S.

&quot;D12 World&quot; was released on April 27, 2004, featuring production by Eminem, Mr. Porter, Dr. Dre and Kanye West, and guest appearances by Obie Trice on the track &quot;Loyalty&quot; and B-Real of Cypress Hill on the track &quot;American Psycho II&quot;. It debuted at the top of the U.S., UK, and Australian albums charts, and at number two in Germany—selling over half a million records in its first week of release in the U.S. alone. &quot;My Band&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, also reached number one in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. rhythmic top forty, the top five in the UK and Germany, and the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2005, Bizarre and Proof released their debut studio albums &quot;Hannicap Circus&quot; and &quot;Searching for Jerry Garcia&quot;. They debuted at numbers 48 and 65 on the U.S., respectively.

On April 11, 2006, Proof &quot;pistol-whipped an unarmed man and shot him in the head&quot;, and was in turn fatally shot by the man&#x27;s cousin.

Since then, Eminem was no longer an active member of the group, having guest appearances only on two tracks, &quot;Fame&quot; on &quot;Return of the Dozen Vol. 2&quot; (2011) and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night Intro&quot; on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Night Mixtape&quot; (2015). On December 5, 2006, Shady Records released &quot;Eminem Presents: The Re-Up&quot; which featured performances by Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater and Cashis while affiliated artists such as Lloyd Banks, Akon and Nate Dogg, made guest appearances. Some tracks were collaborative performances from D12 members, such as &quot;Murder&quot; by Bizarre and Kuniva and &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; by Swifty McVay and Kon Artis. The track &quot;Trapped&quot; by Proof included an intro by Eminem paying his final respects saying, &quot;Big Proof, rest in peace dudey we love you. We just wanna keep making you proud.&quot;

===Mixtapes, unreleased third studio album and disbandment (2008–2018)===

On May 21, 2008, D12 released their first mixtape &quot;Return of the Dozen Vol. 1&quot;. In 2010, the group recorded &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot; for Eminem&#x27;s scrapped seventh studio album &quot;Relapse 2&quot;. The mixtape &quot;Return of the Dozen Vol. 2&quot; (2011) followed three years later. It featured Fuzz Scoota, a new member of the group. On August 5, 2011, D12 performed at the Kanrocksas Music Festival. In 2012, Bizarre and Kon Artis left the group.

In January 2014, Mark Bass of the Bass Brothers confirmed that D12 had been recently recording at the F.B.T. studio and he had been mixing their recorded material. He also confirmed that Eminem was featured on at least three songs that had been completed. In February 2014, Bizarre confirmed that he was back in the group and that D12 would be releasing their third studio album during 2014. On August 25, 2014, a press release on Eminem&#x27;s official website also revealed D12 to be featured on the label&#x27;s upcoming two-disc compilation album, titled &quot;Shady XV&quot;. The album, released on November 24, 2014, featured one greatest hits disc and one disc with new material from a variety of Shady Records recording artists, including D12. Their new song was entitled &quot;Bane&quot;, which features the return of Mr. Porter and was also produced by him.

On August 18, 2015, D12 confirmed on Tim Westwood TV that they had already recorded a large number of songs for the album and will release it &quot;when the time is right.&quot; On October 1, 2015, it was announced that D12 would be releasing a new mixtape, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Night Mixtape&quot;. It was released on October 30, 2015 and featured Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;, Crooked I and Young Buck. The mixtape was hosted by DJ Whoo Kid.

On August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, containing a song titled &quot;Stepping Stone&quot;, on which he declared that &#x27;D12 is over,&#x27; indicating his formal retirement from the group after many years of inactive membership. Bizarre, Kuniva and Swifty have continued to tour and record as D12.

In 2021, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; was re-released digitally as an expanded edition to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release which featured three bonus tracks, an unreleased freestyle, and the instrumentals.

In 2023, Swifty McVay and Kuniva opened for several shows on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s I Wanna Thank Me Tour, in which they performed D12 songs. Later that year, they played shows in the UK and the Netherlands in celebration of &quot;D12 World&quot;″s 20th anniversary.

<doc id="432698" wikidata="Q2593014" url="?curid=432698" title="Fong Sai-yuk">
<text>Fong Sai-yuk (or Fang Shiyu) is a semi-fictional Chinese martial artist and folk hero from Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province of the Qing dynasty. Fong was also associated with Hung Hei-gun and the Five Elders of the Southern Shaolin Monastery. He was a disciple of Shaolin and his martial arts techniques were considered to have contributed to the development of Hung Ga Kuen.

He was first mentioned in &quot;wuxia&quot; stories dating from the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), such as &quot;Shaolin Xiao Yingxiong&quot; (少林小英雄; &quot;Young Hero of Shaolin&quot;), &quot;Wan Nian Qing&quot; () and &quot;Qianlong You Jiangnan&quot; (乾隆游江南; &quot;The Qianlong Emperor Visits Jiangnan&quot;).

Although Fong Sai-yuk is a fictional character, the stories about him treat him as if he really existed. He has been the subject of various novels, movies and dramas. Stories about Fong have been adapted into films and television series since 1949. The most notable ones are the 1993 Hong Kong film &quot;Fong Sai-yuk&quot; and its sequel, which both starred Jet Li.

==Background==

His father, Fong Tak (方德; Fang De), was a wealthy merchant, while his mother, Miu Tsui-fa (苗翠花; Miao Cuihua), was a martial arts expert 
and the daughter of Miu Hin, one of the Five Elders of Shaolin who escaped the Shaolin massacre. Sai-yuk trained in martial arts from his mother from an early age.

When he was still 10 years old, Sai-yuk was challenged by Lei Lao Ho to a duel and accidentally killed him in a battle. Following the fight, the local authorities were ordered to find Sai-yuk and beat him to death. To escape those who pursued him over the killing of the aforementioned master, Sai-yuk ran to Fujian Shaolin Temple to hide from pursuers. There, he was accepted by the temple occupants and trained with them in martial arts.

Due to this incident, Bak Mei and his disciples decided to seek revenge on Sai-yuk. Because of this, Sai-yuk left the Shaolin temple to train more in Shaolin Martial arts and traditional techniques.

<text>Gael Turnbull (7 April 1928 – 2 July 2004) was a Scottish poet who was an important figure in the British Poetry Revival of the 1960s and 1970s.

==Biography==
Turnbull was born in Edinburgh and grew up in Northern England and in Canada, where he moved with his parents at the beginning of World War II. He studied Natural Sciences at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and graduated in Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951. As a doctor and anesthetist, he worked in Ontario; London, England; Ventura, California; Worcester; and Barrow-in-Furness.

His poetry first appeared in a book in Canada in 1954. &quot;Trio,&quot; an anthology of poems by Turnbull, Eli Mandel and Phyllis Webb, was published by Raymond Souster&#x27;s Contact Press. His poems also appeared in &quot;Origin,&quot; Cid Corman&#x27;s magazine.

In 1957, Turnbull started Migrant Press, one of the first British-run presses to focus on poets in the modernist tradition. His work was featured in the groundbreaking Revival anthology &quot;Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain&quot; (1969). His own books include &quot;A Gathering of Poems 1950-1980&quot; (1983) and &quot;Rattle of Scree: Poems&quot; (1997). He was also published in the anthologies &quot;The New British Poetry&quot; (1988), &quot;&quot; (1999) and &quot;Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry&quot; (2001). He was a significant presence on the &#x27;late modernist&#x27; poetry scene, as evidenced by his extensive correspondence with poet Roy Fisher.

He returned to Edinburgh after he retired from medical practice in 1989. In this city, he worked on what he termed kinetic poems; texts for installation in which the movement of the reader and/or of the text became part of the reading experience. He died on a visit to Herefordshire of a sudden brain hemorrhage.

In 2006, Turnbull&#x27;s collected poems, &quot;There Are Words&quot;, were published by Shearsman Books.
