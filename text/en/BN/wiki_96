<text>Draper Laboratory is an American non-profit research and development organization, headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts; its official name is The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc. The laboratory specializes in the design, development, and deployment of advanced technology solutions to problems in national security, space exploration, health care and energy.

The laboratory was founded in 1932 by Charles Stark Draper at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop aeronautical instrumentation, and came to be called the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. During this period the laboratory is best known for developing the Apollo Guidance Computer, the first silicon integrated circuit-based computer. It was renamed for its founder in 1970, and separated from MIT in 1973 to become an independent, non-profit organization.

The expertise of the laboratory staff includes the areas of guidance, navigation, and control technologies and systems; fault-tolerant computing; advanced algorithms and software systems; modeling and simulation; and microelectromechanical systems and multichip module technology.

==History==
In 1932 Charles Stark Draper, an MIT aeronautics professor, founded a teaching laboratory to develop the instrumentation needed for tracking, controlling and navigating aircraft. During World War II, Draper&#x27;s lab was known as the Confidential Instrument Development Laboratory. Later, the name was changed to the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory or I-Lab. As of 1970, it was located at 45 Osborn Street in Cambridge.

The laboratory was renamed for its founder in 1970 and remained a part of MIT until 1973 when it became an independent, not-for-profit research and development corporation. The transition to an independent corporation arose out of pressures for divestment of MIT laboratories doing military research at the time of the Vietnam War, despite the absence of a role of the laboratory in that war.

As it divested from MIT, the laboratory was initially moved to 75 Cambridge Parkway and other scattered buildings near MIT, until a centralized new building could be erected at 555 Technology Square. The complex, designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (Chicago), was opened in 1976 (later renamed the &quot;Robert A. Duffy Building&quot; in 1992).

In 1984, the newly-built Albert G. Hill Building was opened at One Hampshire Street, and connected across the street to the main building via a securely enclosed pedestrian skybridge. However in 1989, Draper Lab was compelled to cut its workforce of over 2000 in half, through a combination of early retirement, attrition, and involuntary layoffs. This drastic shrinkage was caused by cutbacks in defense funding, and changes in government contracting rules. In response, Draper expanded its work addressing non-defense national goals in areas such as space exploration, energy resources, medicine, robotics, and artificial intelligence, and also took measures to increase its non-government work, eventually growing to 1400 employees within the decade.

In 2017, a formerly open-air courtyard between the original buildings was converted into an enclosed multistory atrium to accommodate security scanning, reception, semipublic areas, temporary exhibition space, and employee dining facilities. The open, airy interior space, designed by Boston architects Elkus Manfredi, features a green wall planting and plentiful seating.

A primary focus of the laboratory&#x27;s programs throughout its history has been the development and early application of advanced guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C) technologies to meet the needs of the US Department of Defense and NASA. The laboratory&#x27;s achievements include the design and development of accurate and reliable guidance systems for undersea-launched ballistic missiles, as well as for the Apollo Guidance Computer that unfailingly guided the Apollo astronauts to the Moon and back safely to Earth. 

The laboratory contributed to the development of inertial sensors, software, and other systems for the GN&amp;C of commercial and military aircraft, submarines, strategic and tactical missiles, spacecraft, and uncrewed vehicles. Inertial-based GN&amp;C systems were central for navigating ballistic missile submarines for long periods of time undersea to avoid detection, and guiding their submarine-launched ballistic missiles to their targets, starting with the UGM-27 Polaris missile program.

The Apollo software team was led by Margaret Hamilton (who wrote code to provide visual cues when prioritization was working correctly) and included work by programmers such as Hal Laning, Dick Battin and Don Eyles.

==Technical areas==

According to its website, the laboratory staff applies its expertise to autonomous air, land, sea and space systems; information integration; distributed sensors and networks; precision-guided munitions; biomedical engineering; chemical/biological defense; and energy system modeling and management. When appropriate, Draper works with partners to transition their technology to commercial production.

The laboratory encompasses seven areas of technical expertise:

* Strategic Systems: Application of guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C) expertise to hybrid GPS-aided technologies and to submarine navigation and strategic weapons security.
* Space Systems: As &quot;NASA&#x27;s technology development partner and transition agent for planetary exploration&quot;, development of GN&amp;C and high-performance science instruments. Expertise also addresses the national security space sector.
* Tactical Systems: Development of maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, miniaturized munitions guidance, guided aerial delivery systems for materiel, soldier-centered physical and decision support systems, secure electronics and communications, and early intercept guidance for missile defense engagement.
* Special Programs: Concept development, prototyping, low-rate production, and field support for first-of-a-kind systems, connected with the other technical areas.
* Biomedical Systems: Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidic applications of medical technology, and miniaturized smart medical devices.
* Air Warfare and ISR: Intelligence technology for targeting and target planning applications.
* Energy Solutions: Managing the reliability, efficiency, and performance of equipment throughout complex energy generation and consumption systems, including coal-fired power plants or the International Space Station.

==Notable projects==
Project areas that have surfaced in the news referred to Draper Laboratory&#x27;s core expertise in inertial navigation, as recently as 2003. More recently, emphasis has shifted to research in innovative space navigation topics, intelligent systems that rely on sensors and computers to make autonomous decisions, and nano-scale medical devices.

===Inertial navigation===
The laboratory staff has studied ways to integrate input from Global Positioning System (GPS) into Inertial navigation system-based navigation in order to lower costs and improve reliability. Military inertial navigation systems (INS) cannot totally rely on GPS satellite availability for course correction (which is necessitated by gradual error growth or &quot;drift&quot;), because of the threat of hostile blocking or jamming of signal. A less accurate inertial system usually means a less costly system, but one that requires more frequent recalibration of position from another source, like GPS. Systems which integrate GPS with INS are classified as &quot;loosely coupled&quot; (pre-1995), &quot;tightly coupled&quot; (1996-2002), or &quot;deeply integrated&quot; (2002 onwards), depending on the degree of integration of the hardware. , it was envisioned that many military and civilian uses would integrate GPS with INS, including the possibility of artillery shells with a deeply integrated system that can withstand 20,000 g, when fired from a cannon.

===Space navigation===

In 2010 Draper Laboratory and MIT collaborated with two other partners as part of the Next Giant Leap team to win a grant towards achieving the Google Lunar X Prize send the first privately funded robot to the Moon. To qualify for the prize, the robot must travel 500 meters across the lunar surface and transmit video, images and other data back to Earth. A team developed a &quot;Terrestrial Artificial Lunar and Reduced Gravity Simulator&quot; to simulate operations in the space environment, using Draper Laboratory&#x27;s guidance, navigation and control algorithm for reduced gravity.

In 2012, Draper Laboratory engineers in Houston, Texas developed a new method for turning the International Space Station, called the &quot;optimal propellant maneuver&quot;, which achieved a 94 percent savings over previous practice. The algorithm takes into account everything that affects how the station moves, including &quot;the position of its thrusters and the effects of gravity and gyroscopic torque&quot;.

, at a personal scale, Draper was developing a garment for use in orbit that uses Controlled Moment Gyros (CMGs) that creates resistance to movement of an astronaut&#x27;s limbs to help mitigate bone loss and maintain muscle tone during prolonged space flight. The unit is called a Variable Vector Countermeasure suit, or V2Suit, which uses CMGs also to assist in balance and movement coordination by creating resistance to movement and an artificial sense of &quot;down&quot;. Each CMG module is about the size of a deck of cards. The concept is for the garment to be worn &quot;in the lead-up to landing back on Earth or periodically throughout a long mission&quot;.

In 2013, a Draper/MIT/NASA team was also developing a CMG-augmented spacesuit that would expand the current capabilities of NASA&#x27;s &quot;Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue&quot; (SAFER)—a spacesuit designed for &quot;propulsive self-rescue&quot; for when an astronaut accidentally becomes untethered from a spacecraft. The CMG-augmented suit would provide better counterforce than is now available for when astronauts use tools in low-gravity environments. Counterforce is available on Earth from gravity. Without it an applied force would result in an equal force in the opposite direction, either in a straight line or spinning. In space, this could send an astronaut out of control. Currently, astronauts must affix themselves to the surface being worked on. The CMGs would offer an alternative to mechanical connection or gravitational force.

=== Commercial Lunar Payload Services ===

On November 29, 2018, Draper Laboratory was named a Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contractor by NASA, which makes it eligible to bid on delivering science and technology payloads to the Moon for NASA. Draper Lab formally proposed a lunar lander called &quot;Artemis-7&quot;. The company explained that the number 7 denotes the 7th lunar lander mission in which Draper Laboratory would be involved, after the six Apollo lunar landings. The lander concept is based on a design by a Japanese company called ispace, which is a team member of Draper in this venture. Subcontractors in this venture include General Atomics which will manufacture the lander, and Spaceflight Industries, which will arrange launch services for the lander. As of September 2023, Draper and ispace are developing a lunar lander called APEX 1.0 to deliver CLPS payloads to the moon 
in 2026.

===Intelligent systems===
Draper researchers develop artificial intelligence systems to allow robotic devices to learn from their mistakes, This work is in support of DARPA-funded work, pertaining to the Army Future Combat System. This capability would allow an autonomous under fire to learn that that road is dangerous and find a safer route or to recognize that its fuel status and damage status. , Paul DeBitetto reportedly led the cognitive robotics group at the laboratory in this effort.

, the US Department of Homeland Security funded Draper Laboratory and other collaborators to develop a technology to detect potential terrorists with cameras and other sensors that monitor behaviors of people being screened. The project is called Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST). The application would be for security checkpoints to assess candidates for follow-up screening. In a demonstration of the technology, the project manager Robert P. Burns explained that the system is designed to distinguish between malicious intent and benign expressions of distress by employing a substantial body research into the psychology of deception.

As of 2010 Neil Adams, a director of tactical systems programs for Draper Laboratory, led the systems integration of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&#x27;s (DARPA) Nano Aerial Vehicle (NAV) program to miniaturize flying reconnaissance platforms. This entails managing the vehicle, communications and ground control systems allow NAVs to function autonomously to carry a sensor payload to achieve the intended mission. The NAVS must work in urban areas with little or no GPS signal availability, relying on vision-based sensors and systems.

===Medical systems===

In 2009, Draper collaborated with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary to develop an implantable drug-delivery device, which &quot;merges aspects of microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, with microfluidics, which enables the precise control of fluids on very small scales&quot;. The device is a &quot;flexible, fluid-filled machine&quot;, which uses tubes that expand and contract to promote fluid flow through channels with a defined rhythm, driven by a micro-scale pump, which adapts to environmental input. The system, funded by the National Institutes of Health, may treat hearing loss by delivering &quot;tiny amounts of a liquid drug to a very delicate region of the ear, the implant will allow sensory cells to regrow, ultimately restoring the patient&#x27;s hearing&quot;.

, Heather Clark of Draper Laboratory was developing a method to measure blood glucose concentration without finger-pricking. The method uses a nano-sensor, like a miniature tattoo, just several millimeters across, that patients apply to the skin. The sensor uses near-infrared or visible light ranges to determine glucose concentrations. Normally to regulate their blood glucose levels, diabetics must measure their blood glucose several times a day by taking a drop of blood obtained by a pinprick and inserting the sample into a machine that can measure glucose level. The nano-sensor approach would supplant this process.

==Notable innovations==
Laboratory staff worked in teams to create novel navigation systems, based on inertial guidance and on digital computers to support the necessary calculations for determining spatial positioning.

==Outreach programs==
Draper Laboratory applies some of its resources to developing and recognizing technical talent through educational programs and public exhibitions. It also sponsors the Charles Stark Draper Prize, one of the three so-called &quot;Nobel Prizes of Engineering&quot; administered by the US National Academy of Engineering.

===Exhibitions===

From time to time, Draper Laboratory hosts free exhibitions and events open to the public, which are presented in special semi-public spaces at the front of the central atrium space in the main Duffy Building. For example, in 2019 Draper presented &quot;Hack the Moon&quot;, a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first Apollo Moon landing on July 20, 1969. The exhibition featured artifacts, such as the Apollo Guidance Computer hardware developed at Draper, and the mission software developed by Draper staffers including Don Eyles, Margaret Hamilton, and Hal Laning. Visitors could practice landing the Apollo Lunar Module on a software simulator, and then attempt to land while riding inside a full-sized motion simulator like the one used by the astronauts to practice the actual mission. Talks by Draper staffers and retirees, and free public concerts rounded out the festivities. A special &quot;Hack the Moon&quot; website was created to memorialize the celebration.

Other exhibitions have highlighted different aspects of the research projects conducted at Draper, including information about employment opportunities. All visitors must pass through a security scanner similar to those used at airports, but special security clearances are not required to access the semi-public areas.

===Technical education===
The research-based Draper Fellow Program sponsors about 50 graduate students each year. Students are trained to fill leadership positions in the government, military, industry, and education. The laboratory also supports on-campus funded research with faculty and principal investigators through the University R&amp;D program. It offers undergraduate student employment and internship opportunities.

Draper Laboratory conducts a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) K–12 and community education outreach program, which it established in 1984. Each year, the laboratory distributes more than $175,000 through its community relations programs. These funds include support of internships, co-ops, participation in science festivals and the provision of tours and speakers-is an extension of this mission.

, Draper Laboratory also sponsors Draper Spark!Lab, at the National Museum of American History on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The hands-on invention workspace operated by the Smithsonian Institution is free to all visitors, and focuses on educational activities for children aged 6 to 12 years.

===Draper Prize===
The company endows the Charles Stark Draper Prize, which is administered by the National Academy of Engineering. It is awarded &quot;to recognize innovative engineering achievements and their reduction to practice in ways that have led to important benefits and significant improvement in the well-being and freedom of humanity&quot;. Achievements in any engineering discipline are eligible for the $500,000 prize.

<text>Acheulean (; also Acheulian and Mode II), from the French after the type site of Saint-Acheul, is an archaeological industry of stone tool manufacture characterized by the distinctive oval and pear-shaped &quot;hand axes&quot; associated with &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and derived species such as &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;.

Acheulean tools were produced during the Lower Palaeolithic era across Africa and much of West Asia, South Asia, East Asia and Europe, and are typically found with &quot;Homo erectus&quot; remains. It is thought that Acheulean technologies first developed about 2 million years ago, derived from the more primitive Oldowan technology associated with &quot;Homo habilis&quot;.
The Acheulean includes at least the early part of the Middle Paleolithic. Its end is not well defined, depending on whether Sangoan (also known as &quot;Epi-Acheulean&quot;) is included, it may be taken to last until as late as 130,000 years ago. In Europe and Western Asia, early Neanderthals adopted Acheulean technology, transitioning to Mousterian by about 160,000 years ago.

==History of research==
The type site for the Acheulean is Saint-Acheul, a suburb of Amiens, the capital of the Somme department in Picardy, where artifacts were found in 1859.

John Frere is generally credited as being the first to suggest a very ancient date for Acheulean hand-axes. In 1797, he sent two examples to the Royal Academy in London from Hoxne in Suffolk. He had found them in prehistoric lake deposits along with the bones of extinct animals and concluded that they were made by people &quot;who had not the use of metals&quot; and that they belonged to a &quot;very ancient period indeed, even beyond the present world&quot;. His ideas were, however, ignored by his contemporaries, who subscribed to a pre-Darwinian view of human evolution.

Later, Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes, working between 1836 and 1846, collected further examples of hand-axes and fossilised animal bone from the gravel river terraces of the Somme near Abbeville in northern France. Again, his theories attributing great antiquity to the finds were spurned by his colleagues, until one of de Perthes&#x27; main opponents, Marcel Jérôme Rigollot, began finding more tools near Saint Acheul. Following visits to both Abbeville and Saint Acheul by the geologist Joseph Prestwich, the age of the tools was finally accepted.

In 1872, Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet described the characteristic hand-axe tools as belonging to &quot;L&#x27;Epoque de St Acheul&quot;. The industry was renamed as the Acheulean in 1925.

== Dating the Acheulean ==
Providing calendrical dates and ordered chronological sequences in the study of early stone tool manufacture is often accomplished through one or more geological techniques, such as radiometric dating, often potassium-argon dating, and magnetostratigraphy. From the Konso Formation of Ethiopia, Acheulean hand-axes are dated to about 1.5 million years ago using radiometric dating of deposits containing volcanic ashes. Acheulean tools in South Asia have also been found to be dated as far as 1.5 million years ago. However, in 2003 examples of the Acheulean from the West Turkana region of Kenya were described which have been dated through the method of magnetostratigraphy to about 1.76 million years ago, and in 2023 finds from Ethiopia were reported dating to 1.95 million years ago. The earliest user of Acheulean tools may have been &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;, who first appeared about 1.8 million years ago (not all researchers use this formal name, and instead prefer to call these users &quot;early Homo erectus&quot;). However, it is impossible to know for sure whether &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; was the only maker of early Acheulean tools, since other hominin species, such as &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, also lived in East Africa at this time.

From geological dating of sedimentary deposits, it appears that the Acheulean originated in Africa and spread to Asian, Middle Eastern, and European areas sometime between 1.5 million years ago and about 800 thousand years ago. In individual regions, this dating can be considerably refined; in Europe for example, it was thought that Acheulean methods did not reach the continent until around 500,000 years ago. However, more recent research demonstrated that hand-axes from Spain were made more than 900,000 years ago.

Relative dating techniques (based on a presumption that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, but there is considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period or one that happened as part of a clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.

The very earliest Acheulean assemblages often contain numerous Oldowan-style flakes and core forms and it is almost certain that the Acheulean developed from this older industry. These industries are known as the Developed Oldowan and are almost certainly transitional between the Oldowan and Acheulean.

Regionally subdivided end times of the Acheulean show that it persisted long after the diffusion of Middle Palaeolithic technologies in multiple continental regions and ended over 100,000 years apart – in Africa and the Near East: 175–166 kya, in Europe: 141–130 kya and in Asia: 57–53 kya.

==Acheulean stone tools==

===Stages===

In the four divisions of prehistoric stone-working, Acheulean artefacts are classified as Mode 2, meaning they are more advanced than the (usually earlier) Mode 1 tools of the Clactonian or Oldowan/Abbevillian industries but lacking the sophistication of the (usually later) Mode 3 Middle Palaeolithic technology, exemplified by the Mousterian industry.

The Mode 1 industries created rough flake tools by hitting a suitable stone with a hammerstone. The resulting flake that broke off would have a natural sharp edge for cutting and could afterwards be sharpened further by striking another smaller flake from the edge if necessary (known as &quot;retouch&quot;). These early toolmakers may also have worked the stone they took the flake from (known as a core) to create chopper cores although there is some debate over whether these items were tools or just discarded cores.

The Mode 2 Acheulean toolmakers also used the Mode 1 flake tool method but supplemented it by using bone, antler, or wood to shape stone tools. This type of hammer, compared to stone, yields more control over the shape of the finished tool. Unlike the earlier Mode 1 industries, it was the core that was prized over the flakes that came from it. Another advance was that the Mode 2 tools were worked symmetrically and on both sides indicating greater care in the production of the final tool.

Mode 3 technology emerged towards the end of Acheulean dominance and involved the Levallois technique, most famously exploited by the Mousterian industry. Transitional tool forms between the two are called Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition, or MTA types. The long blades of the Upper Palaeolithic Mode 4 industries appeared long after the Acheulean was abandoned.

As the period of Acheulean tool use is so vast, efforts have been made to classify various stages of it such as John Wymer&#x27;s division into Early Acheulean, Middle Acheulean, Late Middle Acheulean and Late Acheulean for material from Britain. These schemes are normally regional and their dating and interpretations vary.

In Africa, there is a distinct difference in the tools made before and after 600,000 years ago with the older group being thicker and less symmetric and the younger being more extensively trimmed.

===Manufacture===

The primary innovation associated with Acheulean hand-axes is that the stone was worked symmetrically and on both sides. For the latter reason, handaxes are, along with cleavers, bifacially worked tools that could be manufactured from the large flakes themselves or from prepared cores.

Tool types found in Acheulean assemblages include pointed, cordate, ovate, ficron, and bout-coupé hand-axes (referring to the shapes of the final tool), cleavers, retouched flakes, scrapers, and segmental chopping tools. Materials used were determined by available local stone types; flint is most often associated with the tools but its use is concentrated in Western Europe; in Africa sedimentary and igneous rock such as mudstone and basalt were most widely used, for example. Other source materials include chalcedony, quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale. Even relatively soft rock such as limestone could be exploited. In all cases the toolmakers worked their handaxes close to the source of their raw materials, suggesting that the Acheulean was a set of skills passed between individual groups.

Some smaller tools were made from large flakes that had been struck from stone cores. These flake tools and the distinctive waste flakes produced in Acheulean tool manufacture suggest a more considered technique, one that required the toolmaker to think one or two steps ahead during work that necessitated a clear sequence of steps to create perhaps several tools in one sitting.

A hard hammerstone would first be used to rough out the shape of the tool from the stone by removing large flakes. These large flakes might be re-used to create tools. The tool maker would work around the circumference of the remaining stone core, removing smaller flakes alternately from each face. The scar created by the removal of the preceding flake would provide a striking platform for the removal of the next. Misjudged blows or flaws in the material used could cause problems, but a skilled toolmaker could overcome them.

Once the roughout shape was created, a further phase of flaking was undertaken to make the tool thinner. The thinning flakes were removed using a softer hammer, such as bone or antler. The softer hammer required more careful preparation of the striking platform and this would be abraded using a coarse stone to ensure the hammer did not slide off when struck.

Final shaping was then applied to the usable cutting edge of the tool, again using fine removal of flakes. Some Acheulean tools were sharpened instead by the removal of a tranchet flake. This was struck from the lateral edge of the hand-axe close to the intended cutting area, resulting in the removal of a flake running along (parallel to) the blade of the axe to create a neat and very sharp working edge. This distinctive tranchet flake can be identified amongst flint-knapping debris at Acheulean sites.

===Use===

Loren Eiseley calculated that Acheulean tools have an average useful cutting edge of , making them much more efficient than the average of Oldowan tools.

Use-wear analysis on Acheulean tools suggests there was generally no specialization in the different types created and that they were multi-use implements. Functions included hacking wood from a tree, cutting animal carcasses as well as scraping and cutting hides when necessary. Some tools, however, could have been better suited to digging roots or butchering animals than others.

Alternative theories include a use for ovate hand-axes as a kind of hunting discus to be hurled at prey. Puzzlingly, there are also examples of sites where hundreds of hand-axes, many impractically large and also apparently unused, have been found in close association together. Sites such as Melka Kunturé in Ethiopia, Olorgesailie in Kenya, Isimila in Tanzania, and Kalambo Falls in Zambia have produced evidence that suggests Acheulean hand-axes might not always have had a functional purpose.

Recently, it has been suggested that the Acheulean tool users adopted the handaxe as a social artifact, meaning that it embodied something beyond its function of a butchery or wood cutting tool. Knowing how to create and use these tools would have been a valuable skill and the more elaborate ones suggest that they played a role in their owners&#x27; identity and their interactions with others. This would help explain the apparent over-sophistication of some examples which may represent a &quot;historically accrued social significance&quot;.

One theory goes further and suggests that some special hand-axes were made and displayed by males in search of a mate, using a large, well-made hand-axe to demonstrate that they possessed sufficient strength and skill to pass on to their offspring. Once they had attracted a female at a group gathering, it is suggested that they would discard their axes, perhaps explaining why so many are found together. This popular sexual selection hypothesis is controversial due to the assumptions made about sexual selection among extinct organisms.

Stone knapping with limited digital dexterity makes the center of mass the required direction of flake removal. Physics then dictates a circular or oval end pattern, similar to the handaxe, for a leftover core after flake production. This would explain the abundance, wide distribution, proximity to source, consistent shape, and lack of actual use, of these artifacts.

Mimi Lam, a researcher from the University of British Columbia, has suggested that Acheulean hand-axes became &quot;the first commodity: A marketable good or service that has value and is used as an item for exchange.&quot;

===Distribution===

The geographic distribution of Acheulean tools – and thus the peoples who made them – is often interpreted as being the result of palaeo-climatic and ecological factors, such as glaciation and the desertification of the Sahara Desert.

Acheulean stone tools have been found across the continent of Africa, save for the dense rainforest around the Congo River which is not thought to have been colonized by hominids until later. It is thought that from Africa their use spread north and east to Asia: from Anatolia, through the Arabian Peninsula, across modern day Iran and Pakistan, and into India, and beyond. In Europe their users reached the Pannonian Basin and the western Mediterranean regions, modern day France, the Low Countries, western Germany, and southern and central Britain. 

Areas further north did not see human occupation until much later, due to glaciation. In Athirampakkam at Chennai in Tamil Nadu the Acheulean age started at 1.51 mya and it is also prior than North India and Europe.

Until the 1980s, it was thought that the humans who arrived in East Asia abandoned the hand-axe technology of their ancestors and adopted chopper tools instead. An apparent division between Acheulean and non-Acheulean tool industries was identified by Hallam L. Movius, who drew the Movius Line across northern India to show where the traditions seemed to diverge. Later finds of Acheulean tools at Chongokni in South Korea and also in Mongolia and China, however, cast doubt on the reliability of Movius&#x27;s distinction. Since then, a different division known as the Roe Line has been suggested. This runs across North Africa to Israel and thence to India, separating two different techniques used by Acheulean toolmakers. North and east of the Roe Line, Acheulean hand-axes were made directly from large stone nodules and cores; while, to the south and west, they were made from flakes struck from these nodules.
==Acheulean tool users==

Most notably, however, it is &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; (sometimes called early &quot;Homo erectus&quot;), whose assemblages are almost exclusively Acheulean, who used the technique. Later, the related species &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; (the common ancestor of both Neanderthals and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) used it extensively.
Late Acheulean tools were still used by species derived from &quot;H. erectus&quot;, including &quot;Homo sapiens idaltu&quot; and early Neanderthals.

The symmetry of the hand-axes has been used to suggest that Acheulean tool users possessed the ability to use language; the parts of the brain connected with fine control and movement are located in the same region that controls speech. The wider variety of tool types compared to earlier industries and their aesthetically as well as functionally pleasing form could indicate a higher intellectual level in Acheulean tool users than in earlier hominines. Others argue that there is no correlation between spatial abilities in tool making and linguistic behaviour, and that language is not learned or conceived in the same manner as artefact manufacture.

Lower Palaeolithic finds made in association with Acheulean hand-axes, such as the Venus of Berekhat Ram, have been used to argue for artistic expression amongst the tool users. The incised elephant tibia from Bilzingsleben in Germany, and ochre finds from Kapthurin in Kenya and Duinefontein in South Africa, are sometimes cited as being some of the earliest examples of an aesthetic sensibility in human history. There are numerous other explanations put forward for the creation of these artefacts; however, evidence of human art did not become commonplace until around 50,000 years ago, after the emergence of modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

The kill site at Boxgrove in England is another famous Acheulean site. Up until the 1970s these kill sites, often at waterholes where animals would gather to drink, were interpreted as being where Acheulean tool users killed game, butchered their carcasses, and then discarded the tools they had used. Since the advent of zooarchaeology, which has placed greater emphasis on studying animal bones from archaeological sites, this view has changed. Many of the animals at these kill sites have been found to have been killed by other predator animals, so it is likely that humans of the period supplemented hunting with scavenging from already dead animals.

Excavations at the Bnot Ya&#x27;akov Bridge site, located along the Dead Sea rift in the southern Hula Valley of northern Israel, have revealed evidence of human habitation in the area from as early as 750,000 years ago. Archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem claim that the site provides evidence of &quot;advanced human behavior&quot; half a million years earlier than has previously been estimated. Their report describes an Acheulean layer at the site in which numerous stone tools, animal bones, and plant remains have been found.

Azykh cave located in Azerbaijan is another site where Acheulean tools were found. In 1968, a lower jaw of a new type of hominid was discovered in the fifth layer (so-called Acheulean layer) of the cave. Specialists named this type &quot;Azykhantropus&quot;.

Only limited artefactual evidence survives of the users of Acheulean tools other than the stone tools themselves. Cave sites were exploited for habitation, but the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic also possibly built shelters such as those identified in connection with Acheulean tools at Grotte du Lazaret and Terra Amata near Nice in France. The presence of the shelters is inferred from large rocks at the sites, which may have been used to weigh down the bottoms of tent-like structures or serve as foundations for huts or windbreaks. These stones may have been naturally deposited. In any case, a flimsy wood or animal skin structure would leave few archaeological traces after so much time. Fire was seemingly being exploited by &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;, and would have been a necessity in colonising colder Eurasia from Africa. Conclusive evidence of mastery over it this early is, however, difficult to find.

<text>Oksana Serhiyivna Baiul-Farina (; born November 16, 1977) is a Ukrainian retired competitive figure skater. She is the 1993 world champion and the 1994 Olympic champion in ladies&#x27; singles.

Baiul is the first Olympic Champion from Ukraine to compete under the Ukrainian flag. Baiul is the second skater representing Ukraine to win gold at the Winter Olympics after Viktor Petrenko in 1992. She is also the first Olympic champion of independent Ukraine in any sport. 

After winning the gold medal in 1994, Baiul decided to move to the United States and participate in professional ice skating tours and shows. She followed one of her coaches to Connecticut. Later, she also became involved in a variety of TV appearances, and benefit skates. She has lived in the United States since 1994. In 1997, she published two books, a memoir about her life and one on skating.

==Early life and education==
Baiul was born on 16 November 1977 in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union, an industrial city famous for manufacturing Soviet missiles. Her parents divorced when she was two years old, and her father, Sergey Baiul—who died in 2006—disappeared shortly after. No one is certain whether he deserted his family or was pressured to leave town when he and his wife divorced. She was raised by her mother, Marina, a French teacher, and her maternal grandparents. In addition to having Ukrainian ancestry, she is of Russian descent through her maternal grandfather.

Her grandfather died in 1987, and her grandmother in 1988. In 1991, her mother, who had been very healthy, died suddenly of ovarian cancer, when Baiul was 13. Her father appeared at her mother&#x27;s funeral, but Baiul wanted nothing to do with him. She lived with the wife of her coach, Stanislav Koritek, who had moved to Canada, and then with friends.

After moving to Odessa in mid-1992, Baiul lived chiefly in a dormitory. Her expenses were covered by the state because of her promise in skating. In 1993, she lived a month with coach Galina Zmievskaya between the European and World championships. 

==Move to the United States==
After the 1994 Winter Olympics, Baiul moved to the United States and started living in Simsbury, Connecticut. It is the location of the International Skating Center of Connecticut. In the late 1990s, she followed her coach, Valentyn Nikolayev, to Richmond, Virginia, where she lived for several years before moving to Cliffside Park, New Jersey. After residing there for 14 years, Baiul moved to Pennsylvania in March 2012, settling in Upper Makefield Township, Bucks County.

In January 1997 (three years after winning the gold medal), Baiul was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol after crashing her car into a tree in Bloomfield, Connecticut. The charges were dropped after she met the terms of probation and completed an alcohol education program. Her drinking problem worsened, however. In May 1997, she entered an alcohol rehabilitation program for two and a half months. In a 2004 interview, she said she had been sober for six years, saying &quot;This is more important than Olympic gold.&quot;

=== Religious views ===
Baiul was raised as a Russian Orthodox Christian. As a child, she heard rumors that her maternal grandmother was Jewish. In 2003, years after her father left the family, she phoned her old rink in Dnipro to ask for assistance in locating him. Assuming it was a prank, they hung up twice. Eventually Baiul convinced them of her identity. The rink manager helped her reunite with her father Sergey Baiul in September 2003, when she was 25 years old. 

He confirmed that her Romanian maternal grandmother was Jewish. According to Orthodox Judaism, her mother and Baiul would also be classified as halakhically Jewish. Baiul decided to identify as Jewish because of the custom of matrilineality in Judaism. In 2005, she said, &quot;Being Jewish, that feels good. It feels natural, like a second skin&quot;.

==Education and training==
As a child, Baiul was interested in ballet, but was told she did not have the right body type. Her grandmother took her to skating lessons, saying it was ballet on skates. Her grandfather was also supportive of her skating, which she began at age three in Dnipro. He believed that she could be a future prima ballerina and that skating was a fine training ground for dance. Baiul pursued ballet, but ultimately chose ice skating. As she trained, her mother paid for her training expenses, including lessons, costumes, and equipment. By the age of five, she was studying with Stanislav Koritek, a prominent Ukrainian coach.

She was coached by Koritek until he was offered a coaching job in Toronto, Ontario, in March 1992. He accepted due to lack of support for the sport in Ukraine as it struggled economically after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In August 1992, his father, Alfred Koritek, vice-president of the Ukrainian skating federation, called coach Galina Zmievskaya on Baiul&#x27;s behalf. She took her on as a student, arranging for the girl to move to her home in Odesa. Zmievskaya welcomed her into her circle of elite skaters, and provided her shelter in her family&#x27;s cramped three-room apartment in the city. Under Zmievskaya&#x27;s training, Baiul made rapid progress. Her other coach in Odesa was Valentyn Nikolayev. She represented FSC &quot;Ukraine&quot; (Odesa, Dnipro).

==Competitive career==
=== 1993 European and World championships ===
Baiul began competing and took the silver medal at the 1993 European Championships in Helsinki, finishing second to Surya Bonaly of France. 

Prior to the 1993 World Championships in Prague, Baiul had crashed into the boards and displaced disks in her back and neck. At the event, she stopped practicing and consulted a Czech doctor. She competed in skates with crooked blades because it was too late to try a new pair. Ranked second in the short program and first in the free skate, she finished ahead of Bonaly and became world champion at age 15.

=== 1994 European Championships and Winter Olympics ===
In 1994, Baiul won the silver medal at the European Championships in Copenhagen, again finishing second to Bonaly. At the 1994 Winter Olympics, she was second to American Nancy Kerrigan after the short program of Ladies&#x27; singles. During a practice session before the long program, she collided with Germany&#x27;s Tanja Szewczenko, sustaining a wrenched lower back and a cut on her right shin, which required three stitches. As others continued practicing, Katarina Witt skated out, helping Baiul off the ice. 

She received two Olympic-approved pain-killing injections of anaesthetics in her lower back and shoulder, which enabled her to compete in the free skate. She won the free skate over Kerrigan. She added one additional triple jump towards the end of her skating program that was not originally planned in her program. By the slimmest of margins, she won the gold medal. It was a controversial win that was defended by the referee, who said that Baiul had skated in an artistic and engaging style while Kerrigan skated cautiously. She won the Olympic gold medal at the age of 16 years and 101 days, becoming one of the youngest figure skating Olympic champions. Kerrigan placed second and Chen Lu from China placed third. Baiul was announced as the winner after Surya Bonaly and Katarina Witt completed their respective programs out of medal contention. In addition to her Olympic title, Ukraine named her in 1994 as a Merited Master of Sports.

=== Professional career (touring) ===
Despite their status as Olympic champions, Baiul and Viktor Petrenko faced difficulties in Odesa, as did fellow Ukrainians across the country. The country was struggling economically and conditions at their rink in Odesa had deteriorated severely. The government could not extend financial support for figure skating following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Lacking a working ice resurfacer, coaches and skaters often had to resurface the rink ice by hand.

Such conditions influenced Baiul&#x27;s decision to turn professional after the 1994 Winter Olympics, although she was only 16 years old. Zmievskaya negotiated a very profitable contract for her to tour the United States following the Olympics and earn money with her sport. In May 1994, at age 16, Baiul signed an agreement with the American talent agency William Morris Endeavor.

Baiul said later that her drinking problems began during this tour. She said: 
&quot;Except myself, nearly all the figure skaters on the bus were grown-ups, and it was full of alcohol. Most of the skaters were Russians and Americans, and they all drank. That&#x27;s when I tried it. I was very young, with no one to teach me the right. I thought it was the norm, &#x27;cause as a teenager you don&#x27;t want to break away from the majority.&quot;

Following the Olympics, Baiul was plagued by physical ailments that affected her skating ability. She required arthroscopic knee surgery in the summer of 1994, after which she was advised by her doctor not to return to the ice for two months. Due to the million-dollar touring contract, Baiul ignored the doctor&#x27;s recommendations. She resumed skating in two weeks and returned to performing in six. Her jumping ability became hindered.

==Life after retirement from competition==
In 1994, Zmievskaya was asked to lead the coaching staff at Simsbury, Connecticut&#x27;s newly built International Skating Center. Both Baiul and Viktor Petrenko followed her there to train with her. 

Baiul portrayed Clara and Dorothy Gale in the CBS productions of &quot;The Nutcracker on Ice&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz on Ice&quot;, respectively. In May 1997, she was dropped from the &quot;Champions on Ice&quot; tour due to concerns about her drinking. 

She decided to part ways with Zmievskaya the same year. Baiul had completed a rehab program and, in August 1998, she began training under Natalia Linichuk at the University of Delaware&#x27;s skating center. She has continued to skate professionally from time to time, including an engagement with the touring show &quot;Broadway on Ice.&quot;

In December 2006, Baiul traveled to Russia and skated at the Red Square ice rink in Moscow, alongside champions from Russia, China, France, and other countries. In February 2007, she collaborated with Saule Rachmedova, a renowned ballet dancer, to bring together Ice Theatre of New York and couture fashion for the debut of fashion designer Levi Okunov&#x27;s &quot;Winter Collection.&quot; The following month, she appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;.

Baiul had a role in the skating stage musical, &quot;Cold as Ice.&quot; The story explores six skaters from Canada, Russia, and the United States preparing for national championships and the Olympics while dealing with demanding coaches, stage mothers, stage coaches, and other trials. The story was conceived and written by former skater Frank D&#x27;Agostino. A full stage version of &quot;Cold As Ice&quot; was produced and presented by the Gateway Playhouse in May 2007.

On 8 March 2009, and again on 14 March 2010, Baiul made guest appearances at the Kate Wollman Skating Rink at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York, as part of its annual show. She also took part in meet-and-greet sessions with skating students after each performance.

Baiul has her own line of clothing and jewelry. In November 2005, she appeared on the Bravo television program &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;. She was also part of the celebrity panel of judges (along with Steve Garvey and Jonny Moseley) on the ABC show &quot;Master of Champions&quot;, which aired briefly in 2006.

In November 2011, her manager (and future husband), Carlo Farina, discovered accounting and collection discrepancies in her account at William Morris Endeavor. After collecting $9.5 million from the company, Baiul filed a lawsuit in November 2012 in Los Angeles for an additional $1 million in compensatory damages and more in punitive damages. She sued NBCUniversal in February 2013 for their alleged illicit promotional use of her likeness. Having withdrawn the November case, she filed a broader lawsuit in New York in October 2013.

In January 2015, Baiul publicly accused her former coaches and compatriots Galina Zmievskaya, Viktor Petrenko, and their manager, Joseph Lemire, of fraud, claiming they &#x27;have been stealing money&#x27; from her for more than a decade. In addition, she accused Lemire of fraudulent attempts to represent her in multiple court proceedings in Ukraine against the state, concerning various assets.

As of January 2015, Baiul is married to her manager, Carlo Farina. She now uses the name Oksana Baiul-Farina. They reside in Shreveport, Louisiana with their daughter, Sophia (born 2015).

==Representation in other media==
*&quot;A Promise Kept&quot; (1994) is a CBS-produced TV movie made about Baiul.

*Baiul is mentioned in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; TV series episode, &quot;Wasted Talent&quot; (season 2, episode 20), during brewmaster Pawtucket Pat&#x27;s song about his brewery, in a reference to her DUI. She was also noted in the TV series episode,&quot;The Griffin Winter Talent&quot; (Season 17, episode 7).

*The song, &quot;Oksana&quot;, by Hawksley Workman, appears on the songwriter&#x27;s album, &quot;Median Age Wasteland&quot;. It is about Baiul.

*In the film &quot;I, Tonya&quot; (2017), she is played by actress Cassidy Balkcom (in an uncredited role), winning the Gold Medal in the 1994 Winter Olympics against American competitor Nancy Kerrigan (played by Caitlin Carver) .

*In the film &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; (2007), Chazz Michael Michaels (played by Will Ferrell) claims to have been her one-time lover. As a possible reference to her nerves of steel, Chazz exclaims she&#x27;s colder than ice, colder than dry ice: &quot;Wait, what&#x27;s colder than dry ice? I&#x27;ll tell you what is. Oksana...&quot;
*In the opening of &quot;Kimberly Akimbo&quot;’s “Skater Planet,” Martin, part of the teen quartet, retorts, “Like you’re Oksana Baiul out there!” in response to Teresa’s teasing.

=== Charitable involvements ===
On 27 March 2010, Baiul skated at a figure skating exhibition for One Step Closer HIV AIDS. Directed and produced by Tim David, the benefit was for the AIDS Resource Foundation for Children. Baiul performed her signature &quot;Swan Lake&quot; program and was part of the meet-and-greet after the show.

Baiul supports the Tikva Children&#x27;s Home Charity, which works to aid the Jewish children of Odesa. In addition, she supports and is a member of the International Museum of Women. This celebrates the lives of women around the world.

<text>Jake Christopher Delhomme (; born January 10, 1975) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). Delhomme played college football at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana, before being signed by the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent after the 1997 NFL draft. Delhomme began his professional career as a practice squad player with the Saints in 1997 and 1998 and played in the NFL Europe for two years in between NFL seasons. Returning to the Saints, Delhomme played his first NFL games in 1999. Delhomme played as the Carolina Panthers starting quarterback from 2003 to 2009. Delhomme held many of Carolina&#x27;s quarterback records until Cam Newton broke most of them. Delhomme led the team to Super Bowl XXXVIII in his first season with Carolina. After his departure from Carolina, Delhomme also played for the Cleveland Browns in 2010 and Houston Texans in 2011.

==Early life==
Delhomme was born to Jerry and Marcia Delhomme, both Cajuns. Delhomme&#x27;s grandfather bred horses, and his father was a jockey who began racing at eight years old. Delhomme has called horses his &quot;first love&quot;, and he, his father, and his brother own and train thoroughbreds. Delhomme played both quarterback and defensive back for Teurlings Catholic; he made the all-state team in high school not as quarterback, but on defense. In addition, Delhomme was a scholar serving as Senior Beta Club president of his chapter in Louisiana.

==College career==
Delhomme played college football for the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then named the University of Southwestern Louisiana, his mother&#x27;s alma mater. The only true freshman quarterback to start for a Division I school in 1993, his passer efficiency rating ranked second among NCAA freshmen quarterbacks. Playing on a team with future NFL wide receiver Brandon Stokley and offensive lineman Anthony Clement, the Ragin&#x27; Cajuns won the Big West Conference twice, and finished with three winning seasons. During his senior year, he led the Ragin&#x27; Cajuns to an improbable win over highly favored Texas A&amp;M 29–22.

Delhomme finished his career as the school&#x27;s all-time passing leader in yards and touchdowns. He started the last 43 games of his career, which was the longest among active quarterbacks at the time. Upon graduating, he was ranked 22nd in NCAA history for passing yards and 28th in total offense. He was inducted into the school&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Professional career==

===New Orleans Saints and NFL Europe===
Delhomme went undrafted in the 1997 NFL draft, but was later signed by the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent. After spending the first season on the practice squad, he was assigned to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe as a backup quarterback to future NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Kurt Warner; Delhomme later said that &quot;Being around someone as mature as Kurt was, that really inspired me&quot;. After another stint on the Saints&#x27; practice squad, he was sent back to NFL Europe, this time as a member of the Frankfurt Galaxy. The Galaxy operated under a rare two-quarterback strategy, utilizing both Delhomme and Pat Barnes; the pair was known as the &quot;Double-Headed Quarterback Monster&quot;. The unorthodox strategy worked, as the Galaxy won World Bowl &#x27;99 over the Barcelona Dragons. Delhomme would later say about his time in Europe:

Following his success in Europe, he was brought back to the New Orleans Saints as the full-time third-string quarterback. In his first NFL start against the Dallas Cowboys, he threw two touchdowns en route to a Saints victory, the team&#x27;s third.

Delhomme continued to see limited playing time the following three seasons, as he was the backup to Aaron Brooks and Jeff Blake. He managed to lead all NFC quarterbacks in overall passer rating during the 2001 and 2002 preseasons. His success, coupled with the team&#x27;s struggles, led fans to chant &quot;We Want Jake, We Want Jake&quot;.

===Carolina Panthers===

With Aaron Brooks cemented as the starter in New Orleans, Delhomme was interested in fighting for a starting spot in the NFL. In the 2003 offseason, he met with representatives from both the Carolina Panthers and the Dallas Cowboys. He eventually signed with Carolina as a free agent. It was his performance against Dallas in 1999 that made new Panthers coach John Fox take notice.

The Panthers had been struggling, and were just one season removed from a dismal 1–15 season, during which they set a then-NFL record for consecutive losses in a single season. Although Rodney Peete was the Panthers&#x27; starter, Delhomme was looked at to be the future of the franchise. It did not take long for him to take over.

====2003 season and Super Bowl XXXVIII====
At halftime of the 2003 season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Panthers were down 14–0. Delhomme took over for Peete and threw three touchdowns, the last coming in a fourth-down situation with just 16 seconds left in the game, to lead the Panthers to a comeback victory. He started the following week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and proceeded to start every remaining game during the 2003 season. Including the playoffs, Delhomme led the Panthers on eight game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime in the 2003 season, the most game-winning drives any QB has ever had in a single season. Delhomme led the Panthers on a Cinderella run through the playoffs, including a double-overtime victory against the St. Louis Rams. After beating the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game, the Panthers made it through to Super Bowl XXXVIII to face the New England Patriots. Despite his personal success in the game (16-of-33 for 323 yards, 3 passing touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 113.6 passer rating), as well as setting a record for longest offensive play from scrimmage in Super Bowl history (an 85-yard pass to Muhsin Muhammad), the Panthers fell on a last-minute field goal by Adam Vinatieri. Delhomme was seen standing on the field during the Patriots&#x27; post-game celebration; he later commented:

====2004 season====
The 2004 season proved bittersweet for Delhomme, as he posted career highs in pass attempts, completions, overall yardage, and touchdowns. The team was stricken with injuries, fielding five different combinations in their offensive line alone. Starting the season 1–7 after the early losses of running backs Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster, as well as Steve Smith, their leading wide receiver, the Panthers rallied for a strong second half of the season. Delhomme finished the final eight games of the season with a passer rating of 102.8, fourth best in the league during that period. He also threw 17 touchdowns and just 4 interceptions en route to winning six of their last eight games. They ultimately positioned themselves for a playoff berth, but lost that chance with a final game loss to Delhomme&#x27;s former team, the New Orleans Saints.

====2005 season====
In 2005, Delhomme helped return the Panthers to the playoffs. In addition to the team&#x27;s success, Delhomme had one of his most productive seasons as a quarterback. His 11 victories as a starting quarterback set a team record, which he later broke in 2008, and was later broken again by Cam Newton in 2015. He set career highs in completion percentage (60.2) and passer rating (88.1). In addition, his success led to Steve Smith leading the league in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns, becoming only the third wide receiver to accomplish the &quot;triple crown&quot; in league history. Once again, he led the Panthers through the playoffs, including a shutout of the New York Giants, and a road victory over the Chicago Bears although the team ultimately fell to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship game.

====2006 season====
Delhomme started the 2006 season as the Panthers&#x27; quarterback, the first time in franchise history that the same quarterback was the starter for three straight seasons. He set records during the season by making 150 consecutive pass attempts without an interception, bettering Steve Beuerlein&#x27;s previous team record. The following week against the Washington Redskins, he continued his assault on the team record books by breaking Beuerlein&#x27;s records for completions and passing yards. Unfortunately, he injured his thumb in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed three games. During his time off, Chris Weinke started for the first time since the 2002 season, and in his first game shattered the team record for passing yards in a single game with 423 yards, but his three interceptions were costly as the Panthers lost the game to the New York Giants. Weinke could only manage a single victory in Delhomme&#x27;s absence (against the rival Atlanta Falcons, only his second victory as an NFL starter), and Delhomme returned for the season finale against the New Orleans Saints.

====2007 season and injury====
The 2007 season started with a win against the St. Louis Rams and a loss to the Houston Texans. However, in the third game of the season (against division rival Atlanta Falcons), Delhomme suffered an elbow injury that would set off a series of changes for the Panthers at the quarterback position. David Carr, who signed with Carolina in the off-season, took over as the Panthers&#x27; starting quarterback. After Carr injured his back in a defeat of the New Orleans Saints, the Panthers signed Vinny Testaverde, who started the next game against the Arizona Cardinals just four days later, and in the process became the oldest starting quarterback to win a game in the NFL. However, an injury to Testaverde coupled with Carr&#x27;s spinal cord injury led to rookie Matt Moore starting in week 15 against the Seattle Seahawks, a game he won. Meanwhile, Delhomme opted for season ending Tommy John surgery on the elbow after two weeks of testing his arm.

====2008 season and return====

Delhomme returned to the starting position for the 2008 season. In the first game of the 2008 season, Delhomme restarted his career by coming back on the San Diego Chargers with a touchdown pass on fourth down as time expired to win the game. This is similar to his debut game in 2003. After finishing the regular season 12–4, tying the Panthers&#x27; 2nd best record in franchise history, the Panthers were eliminated from the playoffs when on January 10, 2009, on his 34th birthday, Delhomme threw for a career worst five interceptions (and lost one fumble) against the Arizona Cardinals in the divisional round of the playoffs, ending the season with an overall record of 12–5 including the loss in the playoffs.

====2009 season====
On April 23, 2009, the Panthers signed Delhomme to a 5-year extension worth $42.5 million, with a $20 million guarantee, putting him under contract through 2014. In the season opener loss against the Philadelphia Eagles, Delhomme went 7 of 17 for 73 yards with four interceptions and a lost fumble, before getting benched for journeyman Josh McCown. Delhomme threw game-ending interceptions the next 2 games, and despite throwing for 2 touchdowns and 7 interceptions with a 54.3 rating through the first 3 games, coach John Fox kept Delhomme as the Panthers&#x27; starting quarterback. Steve Smith jokingly told Delhomme after their loss against the Eagles &quot;I never liked you as a quarterback.&quot; After the team&#x27;s bye week, Delhomme still struggled. In his next three games, he had 2 more touchdowns to 6 more interceptions. In the next four games however, Delhomme only threw 1 interception. In spite of this improved performance, the team went 2–2 in those 4 games. Delhomme&#x27;s bad performance continued with a 0 TD, 4 INT game against the New York Jets. During the loss to the Jets, Delhomme broke a finger on his throwing hand and was replaced by backup Matt Moore for the next two games, a 16–6 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a 20–10 loss to the New England Patriots. After those games, Moore started to heat up. He beat the Minnesota Vikings 26–7, then beat the Giants in their final game at Giants Stadium with a 41–9 win, and went on to beat the New Orleans Saints 23–10.

Delhomme was placed on season-ending injured reserve on December 24, 2009, and was released by the Panthers on March 5, 2010.

===Cleveland Browns===
On March 13, 2010, Delhomme signed a two-year deal with the Cleveland Browns. Delhomme won the starting quarterback job over Seneca Wallace after competing with him during training camp. However, he suffered a high ankle sprain during the second quarter of the Browns&#x27; first game of the season, a loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Delhomme had been notably grounded and thrown to the ground by Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, in a preseason game.) Delhomme saw action again midway through the team&#x27;s Week 5 game after Wallace also injured his ankle. However, he was noticeably not 100% while playing and ultimately re-injured his ankle. Delhomme started against his former team the Carolina Panthers, after Colt McCoy suffered a high ankle sprain. It was Delhomme&#x27;s first start since Week 1. For the season, he threw two touchdowns and seven interceptions while going 2–3 as a starter.
On July 28, 2011, he was released by Cleveland.

===Houston Texans===

Delhomme signed with the Houston Texans on November 29, 2011, after quarterbacks Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart went down with season-ending injuries. Despite his experience, Delhomme was signed to back up rookie fifth-round draft pick T. J. Yates, as Yates had been with the team the entire season.

Delhomme entered the Texans&#x27; season finale against the Titans after Yates suffered a bruised throwing shoulder. He would go on to lead his team on a potential game-winning drive, completing 18 of 28 passes for 211 yards and a touchdown. But the Texans would lose 23–22 after a botched snap on a two-point attempt play. After the season ended, Delhomme told media that he would most likely retire.

==Personal life==

Delhomme married Keri Melancon in 2000; the two were childhood sweethearts, and were &quot;Junior Sweethearts&quot; at Teurlings Catholic. They have two daughters: Lauren Elizabeth, who was born on December 17, 2001, and Lindsey Marie, who was born on February 25, 2007. The Delhommes are devout Catholics. Delhomme wears #17 because it is the date of his first daughter&#x27;s birthday, and she was born after 17 hours of labor. He and his family are Panthers fans.

Delhomme has garnered popularity as a pitch-man for the fast food restaurant Bojangles&#x27;, where he is often depicted as a single-minded fried-chicken addict who audibles Bojangles&#x27; &quot;fixin&#x27;s&quot; at the line of scrimmage. One commercial parodies the film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and the line &quot;Show me the money!&quot;; former teammate with the Panthers Steve Smith is featured in a cameo. Another commercial with Smith portrays the duo as the Dukes of Hazzard, driving the General Lee with a large chicken head on the roof.
Delhomme has also done SunCom Wireless limited edition cell phone commercials that feature a Panthers logo and his signature, and he has appeared in public service announcements for Civitan International. Delhomme is noted for licking his fingers before every play, and sticking his tongue out as part of his focus.

The official Panthers website featured a regular discussion with Delhomme during the regular season, known as &quot;Cajun Up with Jake&quot;.

Since retiring from football in 2011, Delhomme returned to his hometown of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, and worked in banking while also breeding racehorses. His best, a mare named Forest Lake who won several stakes races, retired in 2017 and was sent to be bred in Kentucky.

On July 9, 2019, the Panthers announced that Delhomme would be inducted into the team&#x27;s Hall of Honor along with Jordan Gross, Wesley Walls, and Steve Smith Sr. On August 14, 2019, he was named to the Panthers&#x27; radio team as a color analyst.

<doc id="445272" wikidata="Q5326267" url="?curid=445272" title="Earl of Dysart">
<text>Earl of Dysart (pronounced ) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created by King Charles I in 1643 for William Murray and has been held continuously since then by his relatives.

==Creation==
The title was granted in 1643 to William Murray, who had earlier represented Fowey and East Looe in the English House of Commons. He was made Lord Huntingtower at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. Murray had been a lifelong friend of King Charles I, in fact having been his whipping boy while the latter was Prince of Wales.

==Succession==
Murray was succeeded by his daughter, Elizabeth, the 2nd Countess. In 1670 she resigned the peerage and received a new grant thereof by patent with precedency of her father, and with remainder to her heirs of the body, failing which to her heirs whatsoever. Lady Dysart married, firstly, Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet (see Tollemache baronets for the earlier history of this title), and, secondly, John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale.
She was succeeded by her son from her first marriage, Lionel, the 3rd Earl, who had already succeeded his father as 4th Baronet. Lord Dysart notably represented Orford and Suffolk in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Suffolk, but declined the offer of an English barony. His son, Lionel Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower pre-deceased him and the title was inherited by his grandson, Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart in 1727. The 4th Earl was elected High Steward of Ipswich and Knight of the Thistle. The title passed to the 4th Earl&#x27;s eldest son, Lionel, who became 5th Earl in 1770. The 5th Earl died without issue in 1799 and the title passed to his brother, Wilbraham, former Member of Parliament for Northampton and Liskeard, who became the 6th Earl at the age of 60.

The Tollemache baronetcy became extinct in 1821 when Wilbraham died leaving no direct descendants. The Scottish titles were inherited by the 5th and 6th Earls&#x27; sister, Louisa Tollemache, the 7th Countess, widow of John Manners, then aged 75. On succeeding to the titles Lady Dysart assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Tollemache (or Talmash).

Louisa&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent, William Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower, was created a Baronet, of Hanby Hall in the County of Lincoln, in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1793. However, he predeceased his mother and Lady Dysart was succeeded by her grandson, Lionel the 8th Earl (the son of Lord Huntingtower), who had already succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet. Lionel represented Ilchester in Parliament 1827–30. Lionel&#x27;s son, William Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower, predeceased him in 1872 and, on his death in 1878, was succeeded by his grandson, William, the 9th Earl, Lord-Lieutenant of Rutland.

On the death of the 9th Earl the baronetcy and Scottish peerages separated. The baronetcy was inherited by a male heir, Lyonel, (see Tollemache Baronets for later history of this title) while the lordship and earldom passed to his niece Wynefryde Agatha, the 10th Countess (1889–1975). She was the daughter of Agnes Mary Manners Talmash (sister of the 9th Earl) and her husband Charles Norman Lindsay Tollemache Scott.

Lady Dysart married Owain Edward Whitehead Greaves and was succeeded in 1975 by their eldest daughter Rosamund Agnes Greaves (1914–2003), the 11th Countess. In 2003 her sister Katherine Grant of Rothiemurchus (1918–2011), the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel John Peter Grant of Rothiemurchus MBE, became the 12th Countess. the titles are held by her only son, the 13th Earl, who succeeded his mother in 2011.

The family seat is now The Doune of Rothiemurchus, near Aviemore, Inverness-shire.

<doc id="445274" wikidata="Q2062262" url="?curid=445274" title="Tiburtine Sibyl">
<text>The Tiburtine Sibyl or Albunea was a Roman sibyl, whose seat was the ancient Etruscan town of Tibur (modern Tivoli).

The mythic meeting of Augustus with the Sibyl, of whom he inquired whether he should be worshiped as a god, was often depicted by artists from the late Middle Ages onwards. In the versions known to the later Middle Ages, for example the account in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, Augustus asked the Sibyl whether he should be worshipped as a god, as the Roman Senate had ordered. She replied by showing him a vision of a young woman with a baby boy, high in the sky, while a voice from the heavens said &quot;This is the virgin who shall conceive the saviour of the world&quot;, who would eclipse all the Roman gods. The episode was regarded as a prefiguration of the Biblical Magi&#x27;s visit to the new-born Jesus and connected Ancient and Christian Rome, implying foreknowledge of the coming of Christ by the greatest of Roman emperors.

Whether the sibyl in question was the Etruscan Sibyl of Tibur or the Greek Sibyl of Cumae is not always clear. The Christian author Lactantius identified the sibyl in question as the Tiburtine sibyl. He gave a circumstantial account of the pagan sibyls that is useful mostly as a guide to their identifications, as seen by 4th-century Christians: 
==The prophecy of the Tiburtine Sibyl==
An apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy exists among the Sibylline Oracles, which was attributed to the Tiburtine Sibyl. Its earliest version may date from the fourth century, but in the form that it survives today it was written in the early eleventh century, and has been influenced by the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius. Its first version in Latin dates from the tenth century and may have come from Lombardy, though it was quickly picked up (and rewritten) by the Salian dynasty and the Hohenstaufens. It proved a useful rhetorical tool, valuable for many a ruler; the lists it contained of emperors and kings were revised to fit the circumstances, and hundreds of versions remain from the Middle Ages.

Its conclusion purports to prophesy the advent in the world&#x27;s ninth age of a final Emperor vanquishing the foes of Christianity (heavily dependent on the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius):
This Emperor&#x27;s reign is characterized by great wealth, victory over the foes of Christianity, an end of paganism and the conversion of the Jews. The Emperor having vanquished Gog and Magog, 
In doing so, he will give way to the Antichrist:
The prophecy relates that Antichrist would be opposed by the Two Witnesses from the Book of Revelation, identified with Elijah and Enoch; after having killed the witnesses and started a final persecution of the Christians, 
==Frescoes at the Villa d&#x27;Este==
Ippolito II d&#x27;Este rebuilt the Villa d&#x27;Este at Tibur, the modern Tivoli, from 1550 onward, and commissioned elaborate fresco murals in the Villa that celebrate the Tiburtine Sibyl, as prophesying the birth of Christ to the classical world.

<doc id="445279" wikidata="Q2137580" url="?curid=445279" title="Reggio Emilia approach">
<text>The Reggio Emilia approach is an educational philosophy and pedagogy focused on preschool and primary education. This approach is a student-centered and constructivist self-guided curriculum that uses self-directed, experiential learning in relationship-driven environments. The programme is based on the principles of respect, responsibility and community through exploration, discovery and play.

At the core of this philosophy is an assumption that children form their own personality during the early years of development and that they are endowed with &quot;a hundred languages&quot;, through which they can express their ideas. The aim of the Reggio approach is to teach children how to use these symbolic languages (e.g. painting, sculpting, drama) in everyday life. This approach was developed after World War II by pedagogist Loris Malaguzzi and parents in the villages around Reggio Emilia, Italy; the approach derives its name from the city.

==History==
During the post-World War II era in Italy, the country was overcome with a “…desire to bring change and create anew&quot;, brought on by significant economic and social development, including in education. An account described how a 1976 opposition to the primary education policy of the municipality of Reggio Emilia opened up the preschools to public scrutiny. This resulted in the introduction of the Reggio approach to early education, which was supported by parents and the community.

The approach was based on Malaguzzi’s method, which became known to and appreciated by many educators thanks to a touring exhibition titled, &quot;A Child has 100 Languages. On Creative Pedagogy at Public Kindergartens in Reggio Emilia, Italy&quot;, which opened in 1981 at the Modern Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. As a result, the National Group for Work and Study on Infant Toddler Centers was formed. By 1991, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that the schools at Reggio Emilia were among the top school systems in the world.

On May 24, 1994, the nonprofit organization Friends of Reggio Children International Association was founded to promote the work of Loris Malaguzzi and to organize professional development and cultural events around the approach. In November 2002, during the annual conference of the National Association for the Education of Young Children in Chicago, the North American Reggio Emilia Alliance was formally established.

In 2003, the municipality of Reggio Emilia chose to manage the system and the network of school services and toddler centres by forming the Istituzione Scuole e Nidi d&#x27;Infanzia. This enabled municipal schools and preschools to have independent Reggio-inspired programmes and activities with support from the Italian government.

In February 2006, the Loris Malaguzzi International Centre was established in Reggio Emilia, Italy, as a meeting place for professional development and a research hub for the Reggio philosophy. On September 29, 2011, the nonprofit Reggio Children-Loris Malaguzzi Centre Foundation was established at the Loris Malaguzzi International Centre to foster “education and research to improve the lives of people and communities, in Reggio Emilia and in the world”.

==Philosophy==
The Reggio Emilia philosophy is based upon the following set of principles: 
*Children must have some control over the direction of their learning; 
*Children must be able to learn through experiences of touching, moving, listening, and observing; 
*Children have a relationship with other children and with material items in the world that they must be allowed to explore;
*Children must have endless ways and opportunities to express themselves.

The Reggio Emilia approach to teaching young children puts the natural development of children as well as the close relationships that they share with their environment at the center of its philosophy. The foundation of the Reggio Emilia approach lies in its unique view of the child: to foster education in the youngest learners to promote the best possible integration among children’s &quot;100 languages&quot;. In this approach, there is a belief that children have rights and should be given opportunities to develop their potential. Children are considered to be “knowledge bearers”, so they are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas about everything they could meet or do during the day.
“Influenced by this belief, the child is beheld as beautiful, powerful, competent, creative, curious, and full of potential and ambitious desires.&quot; The child is viewed as being an active constructor of knowledge. Rather than being seen as the target of instruction, children are seen as having the active role of an apprentice. This role also extends to that of a researcher. Much of the instruction at Reggio Emilia schools takes place in the form of projects where they have opportunities to explore, observe, hypothesize, question, and discuss to clarify their understanding. Children are also viewed as social beings and a focus is made on the child in relation to other children, the family, the teachers, and the community rather than on each child in isolation. They are taught that respect for everyone else is important because everyone is a “subjective agency ” while existing as part of a group.

The Reggio Emilia approach to early education reflects a theoretical kinship with John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky and Jerome Bruner, among others. Much of what occurs in the class reflects a constructivist approach to early education. Reggio Emilia&#x27;s approach does challenge some conceptions of teacher competence and developmentally appropriate practice. For example, teachers in Reggio Emilia assert the importance of being confused as a contributor to learning; thus a major teaching strategy is purposely to allow mistakes to happen, or to begin a project with no clear sense of where it might end. Another characteristic that is counter to the beliefs of many Western educators is the importance of the child&#x27;s ability to negotiate in the peer group.

One of the most challenging aspects of the Reggio Emilia approach is the solicitation of multiple points of view regarding children&#x27;s needs, interests, and abilities, and the concurrent faith in parents, teachers, and children to contribute in meaningful ways to the determination of school experiences. Teachers trust themselves to respond appropriately to children&#x27;s ideas and interests, they trust children to be interested in things worth knowing about, and they trust parents to be informed and productive members of a cooperative educational team. The result is an atmosphere of community and collaboration that is developmentally appropriate for adults and children alike.

==Community support and parental involvement==
Reggio Emilia&#x27;s tradition of community support for families with young children expands on a view, more strongly held in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, of children as the collective responsibility of the local community. In Reggio Emilia, the infant/toddler and pre-primary program is a vital part of the community, as reflected in the high level of financial support. Community involvement is also apparent in citizen membership in La Consulta, a school committee that exerts significant influence over local government policy.

Parents are a vital component to the Reggio Emilia philosophy; they are viewed as partners, collaborators, and advocates for their children. Teachers respect parents as each child&#x27;s first teacher and involve parents in every aspect of the curriculum. It is not uncommon to see parents volunteering within Reggio Emilia classrooms throughout the school. This philosophy does not end when the child leaves the classroom. Some parents who choose to send their children to a Reggio Emilia program incorporate many of the principles within their parenting and home life. The parents&#x27; role mirrors the community&#x27;s, at both the school-wide and the classroom level. Parents are expected to take part in discussions about school policy, child development concerns, and curriculum planning and evaluation.

==Role of teachers==

In the Reggio approach, the teacher is considered a co-learner and collaborator with the child and not just an instructor. Teachers are encouraged to facilitate the child&#x27;s learning by planning activities and lessons based on the child&#x27;s interests, asking questions to further understanding, and actively engaging in the activities alongside the child, instead of passively observing the child learning. &quot;As partner to the child, the teacher is inside the learning situation&quot; (Hewett, 2001).

Some implementations of the Reggio Emilia approach self-consciously juxtapose their conception of the teacher as autonomous co-learner with other approaches. For example:

Teachers&#x27; long-term commitment to enhancing their understanding of children is at the crux of the Reggio Emilia approach. They compensate for the meagre pre-service training of Italian early childhood teachers by providing extensive staff development opportunities, with goals determined by the teachers themselves. Teacher autonomy is evident in the absence of teacher manuals, curriculum guides, or achievement tests. The lack of externally imposed mandates is joined by the imperative that teachers become skilled observers of children in order to inform their curriculum planning and implementation.

While working on projects with the child, the teacher can also expand the child&#x27;s learning by collecting data that can be reviewed at a later time. The teacher needs to maintain an active, mutual participation in the activity to help ensure that the child clearly understands what is being &quot;taught&quot;. Teachers partner with colleagues, students, and parents in the learning process. They discuss their observations with them, as part of an ongoing dialogue and continuing evolution of their ideas and practices. This allows them to be flexible in their plans, preparations, and teaching approaches.

Often, teachers listen to and observe children in the classroom and record their observations to help plan the curriculum and prepare the environment and teaching tools to support the student&#x27;s interests.

===Documentation===
Using a variety of media, teachers give careful attention to the documentation and presentation of the thinking of the students. Rather than following standardized assessments, the teacher inquires and listens closely to the children. An example of documentation might be a book or panel with the student’s words, drawings, and photographs. By making learning visible, the student&#x27;s thinking and feeling can be studied while the documentation serves to help with evaluation of the educators&#x27; work and refinement of the curriculum. It provides parents information regarding their child’s learning experience while creating an archive for the class and school.

==Role of the environment==
Malaguzzi believed the physical environment to be of fundamental importance to the early childhood program; he referred to it as the &quot;third teacher&quot;, alongside adults and other students. One of the aims in the design of new spaces - and the redesign of existing ones - is integration of the classroom space with the surrounding environment: the rest of the school, and community the school is a part of. The importance of the environment lies in the belief that children can best create meaning and make sense of their world through environments which support &quot;complex, varied, sustained, and changing relationships between people, the world of experience, ideas and the many ways of expressing ideas.&quot;

Physically, the preschools generally incorporate natural light and indoor plants. Classrooms open to a center piazza, kitchens are open to view, and access to the outside and surrounding community is provided through courtyards, large windows, and exterior doors in each classroom. Entries capture the attention of both children and adults through the use of mirrors (on the walls, floors, and ceilings), photographs, and children&#x27;s work accompanied by transcriptions of their discussions. These same features characterize classroom interiors, where displays of project work are interspersed with arrays of found objects and classroom materials. In each case, the environment informs and engages the viewer.

Other supportive elements of the environment include ample space for supplies, frequently rearranged to draw attention to their aesthetic features. In each classroom there are studio spaces in the form of a large, centrally located and a smaller mini-atelier, and clearly designated spaces for large- and small-group activities. Throughout the school, there is an effort to create opportunities for children to interact. The single dress-up area is in the center piazza; classrooms are connected with telephones, passageways or windows; and lunchrooms and bathrooms are designed to encourage community.

Cohorts or groups of students stay with one teacher for a three-year period, creating consistency in environment and relationships.

==Long-term projects as vehicles for learning==
The curriculum is characterized by many features advocated by contemporary research on young children, including real-life problem-solving among peers, with numerous opportunities for creative thinking and exploration. Teachers often work on projects with small groups of children, while the rest of the class engages in a wide variety of self-selected activities typical of preschool classrooms.

The projects that teachers and children engage in are different in a number of ways from those that characterize American teachers&#x27; conceptions of unit or thematic studies. The topic of investigation may derive directly from teacher observations of children&#x27;s spontaneous play and exploration. Project topics are also selected on the basis of an academic curiosity or social concern on the part of teachers or parents, or serendipitous events that direct the attention of the children and teachers. Reggio teachers place a high value on their ability to improvise and respond to children&#x27;s predisposition to enjoy the unexpected. Regardless of their origins, successful projects are those that generate a sufficient amount of interest and uncertainty to provoke children&#x27;s creative thinking and problem-solving and are open to different avenues of exploration. Because curriculum decisions are based on developmental and sociocultural concerns, small groups of children of varying abilities and interests, including those with special needs, work together on projects.

Projects begin with teachers observing and questioning children about the topic of interest. Based on children&#x27;s responses, teachers introduce materials, questions, and opportunities that provoke children to further explore the topic. While some of these teacher provocations are anticipated, projects often move in unanticipated directions as a result of problems children identify. Thus, curriculum planning and implementation revolve around open-ended and often long-term projects that are based on the reciprocal nature of teacher-directed and child-initiated activity. All of the topics of interest are given by the children. Within the project approach, children are given opportunities to make connections between prior and new knowledge while engaging in authentic tasks.

==The hundred languages of children==
The term &quot;hundred languages of children&quot; refers to the many ways that children have of expressing themselves. Reggio teachers provide children different avenues for thinking, revising, constructing, negotiating, developing and symbolically expressing their thoughts and feelings. The goal is for the adults and children to better understand one another.

As children proceed in an investigation, generating and testing their hypotheses, they are encouraged to depict their understanding through one of many symbolic languages, including drawing, sculpture, dramatic play, and writing. They work together toward the resolution of problems that arise. Teachers facilitate and then observe debates regarding the extent to which a child&#x27;s drawing or other form of representation lives up to the expressed intent. Revision of drawings (and ideas) is encouraged, and teachers allow children to repeat activities and modify each other&#x27;s work in the collective aim of better understanding the topic. Teachers foster children&#x27;s involvement in the processes of exploration and evaluation, acknowledging the importance of their evolving products as vehicles for exchange.

<doc id="445285" wikidata="Q1141890" url="?curid=445285" title="Felicity (TV series)">
<text>Felicity is an American drama television series created by J. J. Abrams and Matt Reeves and produced by Imagine Television and Touchstone Television for the WB. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard were executive producers through Imagine Entertainment.

The series revolves around the college experiences of the title character, Felicity Porter (portrayed by Keri Russell), as she attends the &quot;University of New York&quot; (based on New York University), across the country from her home in Palo Alto, California. The show ran for four seasons from September 29, 1998, to May 22, 2002, with each season corresponding to the traditional American university divisions of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years.

In 2007, &quot;Felicity&quot; was one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;All-&quot;Time&quot; 100 Best TV Shows&quot;. AOL TV named &quot;Felicity&quot; one of the &quot;Best School Shows of All Time&quot;. In June 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Felicity Porter one of the &quot;100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot;.

==Plot==
The series opens at Felicity&#x27;s high school graduation, where she asks Ben Covington, a classmate on whom she has a crush, to sign her yearbook. Moved by his comment that he wished they had gotten to know each other further, she changes her education plans completely, deciding to follow Ben to New York rather than attend Stanford University as a pre-med student. Felicity&#x27;s overbearing parents, concerned about Felicity&#x27;s seemingly rash decision, come to New York to try to persuade her to return home and &quot;get back on track&quot;. Felicity has second thoughts about her decision, but soon realizes that she came not only to follow Ben, but to discover her true inner self.

While Felicity works to sort out her emotions, she continues the basic motions of student life and moves into her dorm. There, she meets the resident advisor Noel Crane. Eventually, the two develop a romantic relationship, and the love triangle among Felicity, Ben, and Noel forms the basic dramatic conflicts in the show throughout the series.

A number of other characters appear and play large roles in Felicity&#x27;s life. Her roommate for the first two years is Meghan Rotundi, a goth Wiccan who occasionally casts spells on Felicity and others. Julie Emrick is one of Felicity&#x27;s best friends, as is Elena Tyler, who often takes classes with Felicity. Felicity also has male friends, including Sean Blumberg, who is always trying to produce new off-kilter inventions, and Javier Clemente Quintata, who manages the Dean &amp; DeLuca where Felicity works for most of her college career.

A recurring episode opener of the show is a stark camera shot of Felicity sitting in a dormitory room or apartment holding a tape recorder, recalling events in order to make a cassette tape to send to an old friend named Sally Reardon (voiced by Janeane Garofalo). This occasionally provides a method for Felicity to narrate an entire episode. At the end of episodes like this, Felicity is often shown to be listening to a tape that Sally has sent in reply.

==Cast and characters==

Characters are listed in title credit order and by appearance on the show.

==Production==

===Setting===
&quot;Felicity&quot; was filmed in part in New York City, and is set at the fictional University of New York (UNY), based on New York University (NYU). Like NYU, UNY is located in Greenwich Village near Washington Square Park, and the school is an important part of the show. Although like other universities, NYU normally welcomes being mentioned in film or on television as free product placement, the university refused permission for the show to use its name, stating that &quot;[t]he negatives kind of outweighed the positives&quot;.

===Writer&#x27;s age===
In 1999, a publicly hyped young writer for the show, Riley Weston, was disclosed as a fraud for claiming to be much younger than she truly was. At the age of 32, she began marketing herself to television studios as a recent high school graduate, passing off her husband as her older brother. She was soon hired by the WB as a writer for &quot;Felicity&quot;. Hailed as a child prodigy and &quot;wunderkind&quot;, she was featured on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s October 1998 list of the &quot;100 Most Creative People in Entertainment&quot;, which described her as an up-and-coming 19-year-old. Shortly thereafter, she was offered a six-figure screenwriting deal with Disney.

===Time-slot and hairstyle changes===
In the summer of 1999, after filming the first season, &quot;Felicity&quot; star Russell—known for what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;[t]hat glorious head of voluminous golden backlit hair&quot;—sent the show&#x27;s producers a photo wearing a short-haired wig. They panicked before learning that it was a joke but then suggested to the actress that a new hairstyle would be appropriate. After being shifted from Tuesday nights at 9:00pm Eastern to Sunday nights at 8:00pm Eastern (WB&#x27;s weakest night) for the 1999–2000 season, the ratings for &quot;Felicity&quot; declined immediately. This decline occurred before the hairstyle change, but the later hair-style change became conflated by some of the public and by some of the popular press and network executives with this earlier event and thus incorrectly blamed the earlier ratings drop partly on the later new hairstyle. After the negative reaction Russell rejected wearing extensions or a wig while her hair grew back. Although storytelling and time-slot changes had already created a ratings decline, a network executive said WB actors&#x27; future hair changes would &quot;be given more thought at the network than it previously would have&quot;. In 2010, TV Guide Network listed the hairstyle change at No. 19 on their list of &quot;25 Biggest TV Blunders&quot;, with several commentators arguing that it was the reason that the ratings of the show dropped. Russell did not agree with the network&#x27;s attribution of the ratings decline, telling &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2000, &quot;I think that&#x27;s a pretty lame excuse. I think a lot more than a haircut was deciding the ratings [last year]&quot;, whichaccording to a September 29, 2023, &quot;Time&quot; magazine articleincluded the timeslot change, which cost the show one third of its viewers. Shannon Carlin, author of the &quot;Time&quot; article, also pointed to a decline in viewership for the network overall, which by May 2000, was in last place in ratings. The haircut incident went on to become a popular culture reference within other television shows, both comedic and dramatic. Despite the controversy, &quot;Felicity&quot; continued for two more seasons.

==Home media==
All four seasons were re-released on DVD by ABC Studios on April 7, 2009, in &quot;slimmer&quot; packaging. On February 9, 2012, it was announced that Lionsgate Home Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series and planned on re-releasing it. Seasons 1 and 2 were re-released on May 1, 2012, and do not contain any extras, subtitles, or other languages besides English. Seasons 3 and 4 were re-released on May 7, 2013.

==Reception==

===Ratings===
The series debut garnered 7.1 million viewers.

===Accolades===
&quot;Felicity&quot; was nominated for 38 awards during its run from 1998 to 2002 and won several, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Series for Robert Primes and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for Keri Russell.

<doc id="445287" wikidata="Q2003768" url="?curid=445287" title="Volvariella">
<text>Volvariella is a genus of fungi with deep salmon pink gills and spore prints.

==Description==
The mushrooms lack a ring, and have an Amanita-like volva at the stem base. Some species of &quot;Amanita&quot; look similar, but &quot;Amanita&quot; has white spores and often have a ring. Since the gills of young &quot;Volvariella&quot; are white at first, they are more easily mistaken for &quot;Amanita&quot;. The genus is estimated to contain about 50 species.

==Taxonomy==
Many sources list &quot;Volvariella&quot; as a member of the Pluteaceae family, but recent DNA studies have revealed that &quot;Pluteus&quot; and &quot;Volvariella&quot; evolved separately and have very different DNA. These studies show that &quot;Volvariella&quot; is very closely related to &quot;schizophylloid&quot; mushrooms like &quot;Schizophyllum commune&quot;.

=== Species ===
== Uses ==
&quot;Volvariella volvacea&quot;, well known as the &quot;paddy straw mushroom&quot;, is cultured in rice straw in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. This species also favors wood chip piles. It is easy to confuse with &quot;Amanita&quot; species such as &quot;A. phalloides&quot; (the death cap). This mistake is the leading cause of lethal mushroom poisoning in the United States. &quot;Volvariella&quot; and &quot;Amanita&quot; cannot be distinguished in the early &quot;button stage&quot;, that, for many, is considered the best stage to collect &quot;Volvariella&quot; for consumption. Like &quot;Amanita&quot;, the paddy straw mushroom has a &quot;volva&quot;, or universal veil, so called because it is a membrane that encapsulates the entire mushroom when it is young; this structure breaks apart as the mushroom expands, leaving parts that can be found at the base of the stalk as a cup-like structure.

Some species of &quot;Volvariella&quot; are popular edibles in Europe, accounting for 16% of total production of cultivated mushrooms in the world.

Chapters Inc. was created in 1994 when founder and CEO Lawrence Stevenson led the buyout and merger of Canada&#x27;s two largest book chains at the time: Coles and SmithBooks (formerly the Canadian division of U.K. book chain W. H. Smith). SmithBooks was acquired from Federal Industries and Coles was acquired from Southam Inc. Canadian General Capital and Pathfinder Capital bought these two chains to build large-format book superstores comparable to those of the American bookstore chains Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders.

The new company was created in April 1995 and the first two book superstores were opened in November 1995. The original superstores were in Burlington, Ontario and Burnaby, British Columbia.

Chapters quickly changed the face of Canada&#x27;s book selling industry. Previously, companies like Coles and Smithbooks had many small stores. Chapters built large box stores with a much larger product selection. Chapters provided chairs and couches for their customers, as well as Starbucks coffee shops, and did not discourage reading inside the store. The company became Canada&#x27;s largest book retailer, with 77 superstores branded as Chapters and more than 280 mall-based stores under the names Coles, SmithBooks (formerly the Canadian branch of W H Smith), Classic Bookshops, the Book Company, and Active Minds. However, the SmithBooks, the Book Company, and Classic Bookshops names have been gradually phased and locations rebranded as Coles stores in recent years. Canada&#x27;s first book superstore, Toronto&#x27;s World&#x27;s Biggest Bookstore, once part of the Coles chain, was also owned by Chapters and had continued to operate under its original name.

Chapters grew quickly. It was criticized, however, for several reasons. It was blamed for the demise of several independent bookstores across Canada, especially alternative stores carrying obscure or controversial titles. Although it was said that Chapters also built its business around moving massive numbers of a few bestsellers, the majority of its sales came from backlist titles. As the company&#x27;s market share grew, it represented the lion&#x27;s share of many publishers&#x27; sales.

Chapters did not keep the box book store market to itself, however, with the opening of Indigo. Headed by Heather Reisman, Indigo began to compete with Chapters in select markets and opened 14 stores. Chapters aggressively expanded into online bookselling with chapters.ca to compete with Amazon and also was a minority investor in Pegasus, a book wholesaler. Pegasus was needed to be able to serve the online sales but the business was resisted by Canadian publishers and was not successful. In the autumn of 2000 Indigo launched a hostile takeover. Indigo was able to convince the Competition Bureau that Indigo was not a viable standalone business given the enormous losses that it was sustaining and thus had to be able to merge with the profitable Chapters retail chain. By early 2001, Indigo had been successful in purchasing Chapters, but kept both the Chapters and Indigo brands; subsequently a number of Chapters stores near Indigo locations were closed. In some cases, Coles and SmithBooks stores were shut down if they were too close to a Chapters site.

Although there are still some aesthetic differences between the store designs of the Chapters and Indigo banners, they now share many common elements. Moreover, aside from Indigo&#x27;s larger focus on music, product selection and special offers are not generally distinguishable from one to the other. Indigo has adopted the Starbucks cafes that were in Chapters stores and has reduced the seating areas in Chapters stores and introduced a very wide range of non-book products which had been carried at Indigo.

In 2014, the company began a move away from books, stocking everything from dishware to bathrobes prominently at the front of its stores, with the remaining book sections at the rear of the stores.

On January 1, 2018, the Chapters location in Bayview Village Shopping Centre was closed 18 years after its opening. The Starbucks café that appeared in all Chapters and Indigo locations was relocated and reopened in the mall. As a result of changes proposed by the owner to develop the site, the LCBO store moved into the former Chapters location in 2019.

==Criticism and controversies==

Since its takeover by Indigo, Chapters has been involved in several controversies, often tied to censorship concerns, or the strong support for Israel by the owner Heather Reisman and her husband Gerry Schwartz. Reisman and Schwartz head the HESEG Foundation, which provides scholarships for discharged lone-soldiers who served in the Israel Defense Forces.

The book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; by Adolf Hitler was removed from the shelves of Chapters. There was controversy in the fact that the book is sometimes used in a historical context and some university or high school courses have the book on their syllabus.

<text>Clive James (born Vivian Leopold James; 7 October 1939 – 24 November 2019) was an Australian critic, journalist, broadcaster, writer and lyricist who lived and worked in the United Kingdom from 1962 until his death in 2019. He began his career specialising in literary criticism before becoming television critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1972, where he made his name for his wry, deadpan humour.

During this period, he earned an independent reputation as a poet and satirist. He achieved mainstream success in the UK first as a writer for television, and eventually as the lead in his own programmes, including &quot;...on Television&quot;.

==Early life==
James was born Vivian Leopold James in Kogarah, a southern suburb of Sydney. He was allowed to change his name as a child because &quot;after Vivien Leigh played Scarlett O&#x27;Hara the name became irrevocably a girl&#x27;s name no matter how you spelled it&quot;. He chose &quot;Clive&quot;, the name of Tyrone Power&#x27;s character in the 1942 film &quot;This Above All&quot;.

James&#x27; father, Albert Arthur James, was taken prisoner by the Japanese during World War II. Although he survived the prisoner-of-war camp, he died when the American B-24 carrying him and other freed Allied POWs ran into the tail of a typhoon en route from Okinawa to Manila, and crashed into the mountains of southeastern Taiwan. He was buried at Sai Wan War Cemetery in Hong Kong. James would later state that his life&#x27;s works originated in his father&#x27;s death.

James, an only child, was brought up by his mother (Minora May, née Darke), a factory worker, in the Sydney suburbs of Kogarah and Jannali, living some years with his English maternal grandfather.

He was educated at Sydney Technical High School (despite winning a bursary award to Sydney Boys High School) and the University of Sydney, where he read English and Psychology from 1957 to 1960, and became associated with the Sydney Push, a libertarian intellectual subculture. At university, he contributed to the student newspaper, &quot;Honi Soit&quot; and directed the annual students&#x27; union revue. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in English in 1961. After graduation, James worked for a year as an assistant editor for the magazine page at &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

In 1962, James emigrated to Britain, which became his home for the rest of his life. During his first three years in London, he shared a flat with the Australian film director Bruce Beresford (disguised as &quot;Dave Dalziel&quot; in the first three volumes of James&#x27;s memoirs), was a neighbour of Australian artist Brett Whiteley, became acquainted with Barry Humphries (disguised as &quot;Bruce Jennings&quot;) and had a variety of occasionally disastrous short-term jobs: sheet metal worker, library assistant, photo archivist and market researcher.

During one summer holiday, he worked as a circus roustabout to save enough money to travel to Italy. His contemporaries at Cambridge included Germaine Greer (known as &quot;Romaine Rand&quot; in the first three volumes of his memoirs), Simon Schama and Eric Idle. Having, he claimed, scrupulously avoided reading any of the course material (but having read widely otherwise in English and foreign literature), James graduated with a 2:1—better than he had expected—and began a PhD thesis on Percy Bysshe Shelley.

==Career==

===Critic and essayist===
James became the television critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1972, remaining in the role until 1982. Mark Lawson described a James review as &quot;so funny it was dangerous to read while holding a hot drink&quot;. He was at times merciless and selections from the column were published in three books – &quot;Visions Before Midnight&quot;, &quot;The Crystal Bucket&quot; and &quot;Glued to the Box&quot; – and finally in a compendium, &quot;On Television&quot;. He wrote literary criticism for newspapers, magazines and periodicals in Britain, Australia and the United States, including, among many others, the &quot;Australian Book Review&quot;, &quot;The Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Liberal&quot; and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. John Gross included James&#x27;s essay &quot;A Blizzard of Tiny Kisses&quot; in the &quot;Oxford Book of Essays&quot; (1992, 1999).

&quot;The Metropolitan Critic&quot; (1974), his first collection of literary criticism, was followed by &quot;At the Pillars of Hercules&quot; (1979), &quot;From the Land of Shadows&quot; (1982), &quot;Snakecharmers in Texas&quot; (1988), &quot;The Dreaming Swimmer&quot; (1992), &quot;Even As We Speak&quot; (2001), &quot;The Meaning of Recognition&quot; (2005) and &quot;Cultural Amnesia&quot; (2007), a collection of miniature intellectual biographies of over 100 significant figures in modern culture, history and politics. A defence of humanism, liberal democracy and literary clarity, the book was listed among the best of 2007 by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Another volume of essays, &quot;The Revolt of the Pendulum&quot;, was published in June 2009. He also published &quot;Flying Visits&quot;, a collection of travel writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;. Until mid-2014, he wrote the weekly television critique page in the &quot;Review&quot; section of the Saturday edition of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

===Poet and lyricist===
James published several books of poetry, including &quot;Poem of the Year&quot; (1983), a verse-diary; &quot;Other Passports: Poems 1958–1985&quot;, a first collection and &quot;The Book of My Enemy&quot; (2003), a volume that takes its title from his poem &quot;The Book of My Enemy Has Been Remaindered&quot;.

He published four mock-heroic poems: &quot;The Fate of Felicity Fark in the Land of the Media: a moral poem&quot; (1975), &quot;Peregrine Prykke&#x27;s Pilgrimage Through the London Literary World&quot; (1976), &quot;Britannia Bright&#x27;s Bewilderment in the Wilderness of Westminster&quot; (1976) and &quot;Charles Charming&#x27;s Challenges on the Pathway to the Throne&quot; (1981), and one long autobiographical epic, &quot;The River in the Sky&quot; (2018). During the 1970s he also collaborated on six albums of songs with Pete Atkin and one album with Julie Covington:
* &quot;Beware of the Beautiful Stranger&quot; (1970)
*&quot;The Beautiful Changes&quot; (1971) with Julie Covington
* &quot;Driving Through Mythical America&quot; (1971)
* &quot;A King at Nightfall&quot; (1973)
* &quot;The Road of Silk&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Secret Drinker&quot; (1975)
* &quot;Live Libel&quot; (1975)

Atkin and James toured together to promote both the final album, a &quot;contractual obligation&quot; collection consisting of parodies and humour numbers written over the years, and James&#x27;s own &quot;Felicity Fark&quot; epic poem. James wrote the album sleeve notes, which mostly linked the songs with thinly disguised jibes at popular artists and trends. On stage James both read from his poem, and introduced the album songs. Despite the success of the tour, there were no more recordings by Atkin, who pursued other opportunities and eventually became a BBC radio producer.

A revival of interest in the songs in the late 1990s, triggered largely by the creation by Steve Birkill of an Internet mailing list &quot;Midnight Voices&quot; in 1997, led to the reissue of the six albums on CD between 1997 and 2001, as well as live performances by the pair. A double album of previously unrecorded songs written in the seventies and entitled &quot;The Lakeside Sessions: Volumes 1 and 2&quot; was released in 2002 and &quot;Winter Spring&quot;, an album of new material written by James and Atkin was released in 2003. This was followed by &quot;Midnight Voices&quot;, an album of remakes of the best Atkin/James songs from the early albums, and, in 2015, by &quot;The Colours of the Night&quot;, which included several newly completed songs.

James acknowledged the importance of the &quot;Midnight Voices&quot; group in bringing to wider attention the lyric-writing aspect of his career. He wrote in November 1997, &quot;That one of the midnight voices of my own fate should be the music of Pete Atkin continues to rank high among the blessings of my life&quot;.

In 2013, he issued his translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The work, adopting quatrains to translate the original&#x27;s terza rima, was well received by Australian critics. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Joseph Luzzi thought it often failed to capture the more dramatic moments of the &quot;Inferno&quot;, but that it was more successful where Dante slows down, in the more theological and deliberative cantos of the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; and &quot;Paradiso&quot;.

===Novelist and memoirist===
In 1980 James published his first book of autobiography, &quot;Unreliable Memoirs&quot;, which recounted his early life in Australia and extended to over 100 reprintings. It was followed by four other volumes of autobiography: &quot;Falling Towards England&quot; (1985), which covered his London years; &quot;May Week Was in June&quot; (1990), which dealt with his time at Cambridge; &quot;North Face of Soho&quot; (2006); and &quot;The Blaze of Obscurity&quot; (2009), concerning his subsequent career as a television presenter. An omnibus edition of the first three volumes was published under the generic title of &quot;Always Unreliable&quot;. James also wrote four novels: &quot;Brilliant Creatures&quot; (1983); &quot;The Remake&quot; (1987); &quot;Brrm! Brrm!&quot; (1991), published in the United States as &quot;The Man from Japan&quot;; and &quot;The Silver Castle&quot; (1996).

In 1999, John Gross included an excerpt from &quot;Unreliable Memoirs&quot; in &quot;The New Oxford Book of English Prose&quot;. John Carey chose &quot;Unreliable Memoirs&quot; as one of the 50 most enjoyable books of the 20th century in his book &quot;Pure Pleasure&quot; (2000).

===Television===
James developed his television career as a guest commentator on various shows, including as an occasional co-presenter with Tony Wilson on the first series of &quot;So It Goes&quot;, the Granada Television pop music show. On the show when the Sex Pistols made their TV debut, James commented: &quot;During the recording, the task of keeping the little bastards under control was given to me. With the aid of a radio microphone, I was able to shout them down, but it was a near thing ... they attacked everything around them and had difficulty in being polite even to each other&quot;.

James subsequently hosted the ITV show &quot;Clive James on Television&quot;, in which he showcased unusual or (often unintentionally) amusing television programmes from around the world, notably the Japanese TV show &quot;Endurance&quot;. After his move to the BBC in 1988, he hosted a similarly formatted programme called &quot;Saturday Night Clive&quot; (1989–1991), which began on BBC2 but was popular enough to move to BBC1 in 1991. It returned in 1994 on Sunday nights, under the title &quot;Sunday Night Clive&quot;.

In 1995 he set up Watchmaker Productions to produce &quot;The Clive James Show&quot; for ITV, and a subsequent series launched the British career of singer and comedian Margarita Pracatan. James hosted one of the early chat shows on Channel 4 and fronted the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Review of the Year&quot; programmes in the late 1980s (&quot;Clive James on the &#x27;80s&quot;) and 1990s (&quot;Clive James on the &#x27;90s&quot;), which formed part of the channel&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations.

In the mid-1980s, James featured in a travel programme called &quot;Clive James in...&quot; (beginning with &quot;Clive James Live in Las Vegas&quot;) for LWT (now ITV) and later switched to BBC, where he continued producing travel programmes, this time called &quot;Clive James&#x27;s Postcard from...&quot; (beginning with &quot;Clive James&#x27;s Postcard from Miami&quot;) – these also eventually transferred to ITV. He was also one of the original team of presenters of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot;, hosting a round-table discussion on Friday nights.

His major documentary series &quot;Fame in the 20th Century&quot; (1993) was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, in Australia by the ABC and in the United States by the PBS network. This series dealt with the concept of &quot;fame&quot; in the 20th century, following over a course of eight episodes (each one chronologically and roughly devoted to one decade of the century, from the 1900s to the 1980s) discussions about world-famous people of the 20th century. Through the use of film footage, James presented a history of &quot;fame&quot; which explored its growth to today&#x27;s global proportions. In his closing monologue he remarked, &quot;Achievement without fame can be a rewarding life, while fame without achievement is no life at all.&quot;

A fan of motor racing, James presented the , and official Formula One season review videos produced by the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA). He attended most F1 races during the 1980s and was a friend of former FOCA boss Bernie Ecclestone. He also presented &quot;The Clive James Formula 1 Show&quot; for ITV to coincide with their Formula One coverage in .

===Radio===
In 2007, James started presenting the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;A Point of View&quot;, with transcripts appearing in the &quot;Magazine&quot; section of BBC News Online. In this programme James discussed various issues with a slightly humorous slant. Topics covered included media portrayal of torture, young black role models and corporate rebranding. Three of James&#x27;s broadcasts in 2007 were shortlisted for the 2008 Orwell Prize.

In October 2009, James read a radio version of his book &quot;The Blaze of Obscurity&quot; on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot; programme. In December 2009, James talked about the P-51 Mustang and other American fighter aircraft of World War II in &quot;The Museum of Curiosity&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

In May 2011, the BBC published a new podcast, &quot;A Point of View: Clive James&quot;, which features all sixty &quot;A Point of View&quot; programmes presented by James between 2007 and 2009.

He posted vlog conversations from his internet show &quot;Talking in the Library&quot;, including conversations with Ian McEwan, Cate Blanchett, Julian Barnes, Jonathan Miller and Terry Gilliam. In addition to the poetry and prose of James himself, the site featured the works of other literary figures such as Les Murray and Michael Frayn, as well as the works of painters, sculptors and photographers such as John Olsen and Jeffrey Smart.

===Theatre===
In 2008 James performed in two eponymous shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe: &quot;Clive James in Conversation&quot; and &quot;Clive James in the Evening&quot;. He took the latter show on a limited tour of the UK in 2009.

==Honours==

In 1992, James was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). This was enhanced to Officer level (AO) in the 2013 Australia Day Honours. James was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to literature and the media. In 2003 he was awarded the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal for Literature. He received honorary doctorates from the Universities of Sydney and East Anglia. In April 2008, James was awarded a Special Award for Writing and Broadcasting by the judges of the Orwell Prize.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2010. He was an Honorary Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge (his alma mater). In the 2015 BAFTAs, James received a special award honouring his 50-year career. In 2014, he was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal by the British Academy.

James is celebrated with a plaque on the Sydney Writers Walk on Circular Quay. It includes an excerpt on Sydney Harbour from &quot;Unreliable Memoirs&quot;.

== Political views ==
James&#x27;s political views were prominent in much of his later writing. While critical of communism for its tendency towards totalitarianism, he identified with the left for much of his life. In a 2006 interview in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, James said of himself: &quot;I was brought up on the proletarian left, and I remain there. The fair go for the workers is fundamental, and I don&#x27;t believe the free market has a mind.&quot; In a speech given in 1991, he criticised privatisation, saying: &quot;The idea that Britain&#x27;s broadcasting system—for all its drawbacks one of the country&#x27;s greatest institutions—was bound to be improved by being subjected to the conditions of a free market: there was no difficulty in recognising that notion as politically illiterate. But for some reason people did have difficulty in realising that it was economically illiterate too.&quot; In 2001, James identified as a liberal social democrat.

His later views were more commonly aligned with the political right. James strongly supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying in 2007 that &quot;the war only lasted a few days&quot; and that the continuing conflict in Iraq was &quot;the Iraq peace&quot;. He also wrote that it was &quot;official policy to rape a woman in front of her family&quot; during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime and that women have enjoyed more rights since the invasion. In 2017, James contributed a chapter to a book on climate change published by the Institute of Public Affairs, advocating climate denialism.

Describing religions as &quot;advertising agencies for a product that doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;, James was an atheist and saw it as the default and obvious position. He was also a patron of the Burma Campaign UK, an organisation that campaigns for human rights and democracy in Burma.

==Personal life==
In 1968, at Cambridge, James married Prudence A. &quot;Prue&quot; Shaw, also Australian, a graduate of the University of Sydney, the University of Florence and Somerville College, Oxford. Shaw taught Italian language and literature at the University of Cambridge, and at University College London where, since retirement in 2003, she has been emerita reader in Italian studies. She is the author of &quot;Reading Dante: From Here to Eternity&quot;.

James and Shaw had two daughters, one of whom is the artist Claerwen James. In April 2012, the Australian Channel Nine programme &quot;A Current Affair&quot; ran an item in which the former model Leanne Edelsten admitted to an eight-year affair with James beginning in 2004. Shaw evicted her husband from the family home following the revelation. Before this, for most of his working life, James divided his time between a converted warehouse flat in London and the family home in Cambridge.

After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, James wrote a piece for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; entitled &quot;Requiem&quot;, recording his overwhelming grief. From then he mainly declined to comment about their friendship, apart from some remarks in his fifth volume of memoirs, &quot;Blaze of Obscurity&quot;.

James was able to read, with varying fluency, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Japanese. A tango enthusiast, he travelled to Buenos Aires for dance lessons and had a dance floor in his house.

James was a fan of the St George Dragons and wrote admiringly of Rugby League Immortal Reg Gasnier who was a schoolmate at Sydney Technical High School. He guest presented one episode of &quot;The Footy Show&quot; in 2005.

== Health and death ==
For much of his life, James was a heavy drinker and smoker. He recorded in &quot;May Week Was in June&quot; his habit of filling a hubcap ashtray daily. At various times he wrote of attempts, intermittently successful, to give up drinking and smoking. He smoked 80 cigarettes a day for a number of years before giving up in 2005. (Prior to this, he had been successful in giving up smoking for 13 years, beginning in his early 30s.)

In April 2011, after media speculation that he had suffered kidney failure, James confirmed in June 2012 that B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia &quot;had beaten him&quot; and that he was &quot;near the end&quot;. He said that he was also diagnosed with emphysema and kidney failure in early 2010.

On 3 September 2013, an interview with journalist Kerry O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Clive James: The Kid from Kogarah&quot;, was broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The interview was filmed in the library of his old college at Cambridge University. In the extended interview, James discussed his illness and confronting mortality. James wrote the poem &quot;Japanese Maple&quot; which was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2014 and described as his &quot;farewell poem&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a poignant meditation on his impending death&quot;.

In a BBC interview with Charlie Stayt, broadcast on 31 March 2015, James described himself as &quot;near to death but thankful for life&quot;. In October 2015, he admitted to feeling &quot;embarrassment&quot; at still being alive thanks to experimental drug treatment. Until June 2017, he wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; entitled &quot;Reports of My Death...&quot;. James died at his home in Cambridge on 24 November 2019.

<text>The Atlanta Gay Center was a community center that served the gay community in Atlanta, Georgia (United States). It was founded in 1976. It has since closed and been replaced by the Atlanta Gay and Lesbian Community Center.

The center published a bi-weekly newspaper, and operated the Gay Helpline for the Atlanta area. The center was the meeting place for several support groups including those for teens, interracial couples, older couples, and P-FLAG.

During the early 1980s, in the early days of HIV/AIDS awareness, the Atlanta Gay Center offered free testing and support groups.

<doc id="445301" wikidata="Q2899221" url="?curid=445301" title="New Hampshire presidential primary">
<text>The New Hampshire presidential primary is the first in a series of nationwide party primary elections and the second party contest, the first being the Iowa caucuses, held in the United States every four years as part of the process of choosing the delegates to the Democratic and Republican national conventions which choose the party nominees for the presidential elections to be held in November. Although only a few delegates are chosen in the New Hampshire primary, its real importance comes from the massive media coverage it receives, along with the first caucus in Iowa.

Spurred by the events of the 1968 election, reforms that began with the 1972 election elevated the two states&#x27; importance to the overall election, and began to receive as much media attention as all of the other state contests combined. An upset victory by an underdog candidate, or a weak showing by a front-runner can change the course of the primaries, as happened in 1952, 1968, and 2008 for the Democrats, and in 1980 for the Republicans.

Since 1952, the primary has been a major testing ground for candidates for both the Republican and Democratic nominations. Candidates who do poorly frequently drop out, while lesser-known, underfunded candidates who excel in New Hampshire can become serious contenders, garnering large amounts of media attention and campaign funding.

The New Hampshire primary is a semi-open primary: unaffiliated voters (those registered without party affiliation) may vote in either party&#x27;s primary. Voters registered with one party cannot &quot;cross vote&quot; to vote in another party&#x27;s primary.

==&quot;First primary&quot; status and efforts to change==
New Hampshire state law provides: &quot;The presidential primary election shall be held on the second Tuesday in March or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is 7 days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election, whichever is earlier.&quot; New Hampshire has closely guarded its &quot;first primary in the nation&quot; status through this provision. The state has held the first primary in each presidential campaign since 1920. 

The Iowa caucuses, which began in 1972 for Democrats and 1976 for Republicans, occur earlier than the New Hampshire primary. Iowa&#x27;s contest is not considered to be &quot;a similar election&quot; because the caucuses do not involve actual balloting.

New Hampshire&#x27;s status as the first in the nation has been considered controversial by those who claim the ethnic makeup of the state is not diverse enough. Efforts to alter New Hampshire&#x27;s first-in-the-nation primary status have periodically occurred. In 2007, different states attempted to leapfrog other states by scheduling earlier primaries and caucuses for the 2008 presidential race. Florida, Michigan, Nevada and South Carolina all moved their nominating contests up. New Hampshire ultimately retained its first-primary status, holding its primary on January 8, 2008, the earliest ever date.

In 2023, the Democratic National Committee approved a calendar that would make New Hampshire the second Democratic primary to be held in 2024. Under the DNC calendar, the South Carolina primary would be held first on February 3, followed by both the New Hampshire primary and Nevada caucuses on February 6. New Hampshire officials of both parties have opposed the move, and vowed to go forward with a first-in-the-nation primary, even if it triggers a loss of its convention delegates as a penalty for breaching the party calendar.

==Mechanics of the primary==
===Voter eligibility===
The New Hampshire primary is a semi-open primary: unaffiliated voters (those registered without party affiliation) may vote in either party&#x27;s primary. Votes registered with one party cannot &quot;cross vote&quot; to vote in another party&#x27;s primary.

===Candidate and party eligibility===
Under state law, officially recognized parties may hold a state-sanctioned primary. To receive official party status, a party&#x27;s candidate must receive at least 4% of the votes cast for governor or U.S. senator in the most recent general election in New Hampshire. Currently, only Democrats and Republicans meet this criterion.

New Hampshire has a low barrier to ballot access. Any person may run for president by (1) paying a $1,000 filing fee or collecting the signatures of 10 registered voters in each New Hampshire county and (2) completing a declaration of candidacy form that declares, under penalty of perjury, that the candidate meets the constitutional requirement for the presidency, being at least 35 years old, a natural-born citizen status, and a U.S. resident for at least 14 years. A candidates must affirm that he or she is a registered member of the party for the nomination they seek. 

The record number of candidates was 62, in the 1992 primary. In the 2016 New Hampshire primary, 58 candidates ran. Many candidates who appear on the ballot are obscure or fringe, and some are perennial candidates. Saint Anselm College runs a Lesser-Known Candidates Forum every four years.

===Balloting===
The primary is conducted by secret ballot. Voters mark their selection on paper ballots, which are tabulated by hand and optical scan.

===Dixville Notch and other &quot;midnight voting&quot; towns===
The communities of Dixville Notch, Hart&#x27;s Location, and Millsfield traditionally participate in the New Hampshire midnight voting, in which they open their polling places at midnight. In particular, the polling place inside the ballroom of The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel in Dixville Notch opens at midnight, usually in front of a crowd of journalists, where the village&#x27;s handful of voters cast their ballots before the polls close about less than ten minutes later. This has led many presidential candidates to visit the area before the New Hampshire primary in hopes of securing an early-morning boost.

==Significance==
There is consensus among scholars and pundits that the New Hampshire primary, because of the timing and the vast media attention, can have a great impact and may even make, break or revive a candidate. Controlling for other factors statistically, a win in New Hampshire increases a candidate&#x27;s share of the final primary count in all states by 27 percentage points.

Since 1977, New Hampshire has fought hard to keep its timing as the first primary, while Iowa has the first caucus a few days sooner. State law requires that its primary must be the first in the nation. It has been the first by tradition since 1920. As a result, the state has moved its primary earlier in the year to remain the first. 

The primary was held on the following dates: 1952–1968, the second Tuesday in March. 1972, the first Tuesday in March. 1976–1984, the fourth Tuesday in February. 1988–1996, the third Tuesday in February. 2000, the first Tuesday in February (February 1). 2004, the fourth Tuesday in January (January 27). The shifts have been to compete with changing primary dates in other states. The primary dates for 2008 (January 8) and 2012 (January 10) continued the trend – they were held the second Tuesday in January, in both years.

In defense of their primary, voters of New Hampshire have tended to downplay the importance of the Iowa caucus. &quot;The people of Iowa pick corn, the people of New Hampshire pick presidents,&quot; said then-Governor John H. Sununu in 1988.

Recently, media expectations for the New Hampshire primary have come to be almost as important as the results themselves. Meeting or beating expectations can provide a candidate with national attention, often leading to an infusion of donations to a campaign that has spent most of its reserves. For example, in 1992, Bill Clinton, although he did not win, did surprisingly well, with his team dubbing him the &quot;Comeback Kid&quot;. The extra media attention helped his campaign&#x27;s visibility in later primaries.

The most recent presidential election winner to win the New Hampshire primary was Donald Trump in 2016. The three presidents before him (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama) finished second in the New Hampshire primary before later being elected to the presidency. The previous four presidents before that, won the New Hampshire primary.

==History==
New Hampshire has held a presidential primary since 1916 and started the tradition of being the first presidential primary in the United States starting in 1920. Until 1948, the New Hampshire primary, like most of the small number of other primaries in the country, listed only the names of local citizens who wanted to be delegates to the state convention. In 1948, Richard F. Upton, speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives decided to make the primary &quot;more interesting and meaningful…so there would be a greater turnout at the polls.&quot; The state legislature passed a law allowing citizens to vote directly for the presidential candidates. Any candidate could get on the ballot if he submitted fifty supporting petitions from each of the two congressional districts. Voters could choose delegates who were explicitly pledged to a particular candidate.

New Hampshire did not begin to assume its current importance until 1952. In that year, Dwight D. Eisenhower demonstrated his broad voter appeal by defeating Robert A. Taft, &quot;Mr. Republican&quot;, who had been favored for the nomination, and Estes Kefauver defeated incumbent President Harry S. Truman, leading Truman to abandon his campaign for a second term of his own. The other president to be forced out of the running for re-election by New Hampshire voters was Lyndon Johnson, who, as a write-in candidate, managed only a 49–42 percent victory over Eugene McCarthy in 1968, and won fewer delegates than McCarthy, and consequently withdrew from the race.

The winner in New Hampshire has not always won their party&#x27;s nomination, as demonstrated by Republicans Leonard Wood in 1920, Harold Stassen in 1948, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. as a write-in candidate in 1964, Pat Buchanan in 1996, and John McCain in 2000, and Democrats Estes Kefauver in 1952 and 1956, Paul Tsongas in 1992, Hillary Clinton in 2008, and Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020.

From 1952 to 1988, the person elected president had always carried the primary. Bill Clinton broke the pattern in 1992, as did George W. Bush in 2000, Barack Obama in 2008, and Joe Biden in 2020. In 1992, Clinton lost to Paul Tsongas in New Hampshire. In 2000, George W. Bush lost to John McCain in New Hampshire. In 2008, Barack Obama lost to Hillary Clinton. In 2020, Joe Biden lost to Bernie Sanders.

===1968===
In November 1967, Eugene McCarthy declared, &quot;there comes a time when an honorable man simply has to raise the flag&quot; and entered the New Hampshire Democratic primary. On March 12, 1968, McCarthy, who was the only candidate on the ballot, came within 7 percentage points of defeating President Lyndon Johnson, a write-in candidate who was technically still exploring his candidacy and had not bothered to file. Just a few days later, on March 16, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy entered the race for President. Johnson subsequently withdrew from the election with this Shermanesque statement: &quot;I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.&quot;

One minor candidate in the Republican primary was William W. Evans Jr., a former New Jersey State Assemblyman, who received just 151 votes statewide.

The 1968 New Hampshire Democratic primary was one of the crucial events in the politics of that landmark year in United States history. Senator Eugene McCarthy began his campaign with a poem that he wrote in imitation of the poet Robert Lowell, &quot;Are you running with me Jesus&quot;:
===1980===
George H. W. Bush emerged as the front-runner of the 1980 Republican presidential primary after his upset Iowa caucus victory over Ronald Reagan. Bush and Reagan became the two leading candidates in the primaries over the other four candidates. With the other candidates in single digits, the &quot;Nashua Telegraph&quot; offered to host a debate between Reagan and Bush. Worried that a newspaper-sponsored debate might violate electoral regulations, Reagan arranged to fund the event with his own campaign money, inviting the other candidates to participate at short notice.

The Bush camp did not learn of Reagan&#x27;s decision to include the other candidates until the debate was due to begin. Bush refused to participate, which led to an impasse on the stage. As Reagan attempted to explain his decision, Jon Breen, the editor of the &quot;Nashua Telegraph&quot; and debate moderator, ordered Bob Malloy, the volume operator, to mute Reagan&#x27;s microphone. When Malloy refused, Breen repeated his order. A visibly angry Reagan responded, &quot;I am paying for this microphone, Mr. , referring to the editor and debate moderator Jon Breen. 

Eventually the other candidates agreed to leave, and the debate proceeded between Reagan and Bush. Reagan&#x27;s quote was often repeated as &quot;I paid for this microphone!&quot; and dominated news coverage of the event. Reagan sailed to an easy win in New Hampshire. Reagan eventually secured the nomination, and selected Bush as his running mate. The two won the general election.

===1992===

Bill Clinton was able to declare himself the &quot;Comeback Kid&quot; after posting a surprise second-place finish behind Paul Tsongas in the Democratic primary. Clinton&#x27;s support had been flagging for weeks since being hit by allegations of infidelity with actress Gennifer Flowers. On the Republican side, Pat Buchanan garnered an unexpected 37% showing behind incumbent President George H. W. Bush. Buchanan did not win a single state, but revealed some doubts about the moderate president among conservative voters.

===2000===

George W. Bush&#x27;s campaign, which for months had dominated in polling, money and endorsements on the Republican side, suffered a blow when John McCain, who had been surging in late polls, ended up beating the governor in New Hampshire by more than 18 points. The result forecast a tough two-man race for the GOP nomination, which carried on until Super Tuesday in March. Al Gore helped himself with a narrow win in the Democratic primary, which somewhat assuaged his supporters&#x27; concerns about Bill Bradley&#x27;s insurgent campaign.

===2004===

Senator John Kerry secured a decisive victory with 35% of the vote, 10 percentage points more than second-place finisher Howard Dean.

===2008===

Hillary Clinton managed an upset win over Barack Obama in New Hampshire, despite polls showing her as much as 13 points behind in the run-up to the vote. The win helped Clinton get back some of the momentum she lost the week before when Obama carried the Iowa caucuses—though Obama eventually won the Democratic nomination. John McCain won the Republican primary, sparking an unexpected comeback for the senator whose long-shot campaign had been written off as a lost cause months before. He went on to win the GOP nomination.

===2016===

Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton by 22 percentage points. Sanders amassed 152,193 votes in total, earning him 15 delegates, while Clinton managed 95,252 votes with 9 delegates. Together with Donald Trump&#x27;s double-digit win in the GOP race, the primary results revealed voter frustrations with mainstream &quot;establishment&quot; politicians.

===2020===

Bernie Sanders narrowly placed first in the Democratic primary once again, edging out former Mayor of South Bend Pete Buttigieg with 76,384 votes to 72,454. Incumbent President Donald Trump won an overwhelming victory in the Republican primary with 129,734 votes, beating former Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld by over 75 percentage points and receiving the most votes in the New Hampshire primary for an incumbent candidate in U.S. history, breaking Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1996 record of 76,797.

===2024===
President Joe Biden was a write-in candidate due to the Democratic primary scheduling controversy; he won the Democratic race with over 64 percent of the vote. Donald Trump won the Republican primary with about 54 percent of the vote, beating Nikki Haley&#x27;s approximate 43 percent.

==Libertarian results==
==Vice-presidential results==
A vice-presidential preference primary was also formerly held at the New Hampshire primary. New Hampshire State Senator Jack Barnes, who won the 2008 Republican contest, co-sponsored a bill in 2009 to eliminate the vice-presidential preference ballot. The bill passed both houses of the state legislature, and took effect in 2012.

The only time a non-incumbent won the vice-presidential primary and then went on to be formally nominated by his or her party was in 2004, when Democratic U.S. Senator John Edwards won as a write-in candidate. Edwards, who was running for President at the time, did not actively solicit vice-presidential votes.

In 1968, the sitting Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the Democratic vice-presidential primary, and then later won the Presidential nomination after the sitting President Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out of the race.

The following candidates received the greatest number of votes at each election.

<doc id="445306" wikidata="Q561547" url="?curid=445306" title="Augustus Hawkins">
<text>Augustus Freeman Hawkins (August 31, 1907 – November 10, 2007) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who served in the California State Assembly from 1935 to 1963 and the U.S. House Of Representatives from 1963 to 1991. Over the course of his career, Hawkins authored more than 300 state and federal laws, the most famous of which are Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act. He was known as the &quot;silent warrior&quot; for his commitment to education and ending unemployment.

== Early and personal life ==
Hawkins was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the youngest of five children, to Nyanza Hawkins and Hattie Freeman. In 1918, the family moved to Los Angeles. Hawkins graduated from Jefferson High School in 1926, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1931. After graduation, he planned to study civil engineering, but the financial constraints of the Great Depression made this impossible. This contributed towards his interest in politics, and his lifelong devotion to education. After graduating, Hawkins operated a real-estate company with his brother and studied government. While serving in the California State Assembly, Hawkins married Pegga Adeline Smith on August 28, 1945. Smith died in 1966, and Hawkins later married Elsie Taylor in 1977. After retiring from Congress, he stayed in the Washington area because his wife preferred it, living there until his death, which came two months after hers.

An African American of mixed-race ancestry, Hawkins was very light-skinned and reportedly resembled his English grandfather. Throughout his life, he was often assumed to be of solely white ancestry, although he refused to pass as white.

==Political career==

=== State Assembly ===

Augustus Hawkins succeeded Republican Frederick Madison Roberts who served in the California Assembly for 16 years. Black representation was so limited that &quot;the black strategy for gaining political power was to exercise influence within the Democratic Party through voting for, and lobbying, white politicians.&quot; Aside from Hawkins, &quot;Los Angeles blacks had no other political representative in city, county, state, or federal government.&quot;

Hawkins was part of a more general shift by African Americans away from the Republican and towards the Democratic Party. Unlike the majority of African Americans, he supported Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign for president in 1932. Hawkins favored measures such as the New Deal, which was wildly popular in the United States at large and the African-American community in particular. Roosevelt would go on to be the first Democratic president to win the black vote, in 1936. In 1934, Hawkins supported the more controversial 1934 California gubernatorial election of Upton Sinclair, a socialist. Although Sinclair lost, Hawkins defeated Republican Frederick Madison Roberts, the great-grandson of Sally Hemings and President Thomas Jefferson and the first African American in the California State Assembly. Hawkins would serve as a Democratic member of the Assembly from 1935 until 1963; by the time of his departure, Hawkins was the Assembly&#x27;s most senior member, as Roberts was before him.

Hawkins&#x27;s district was primarily Latino American and African American. During his time in the Assembly, he introduced legislation including &quot;a fair housing act, a fair employment practices act, low-cost housing and disability insurance legislation, and workers&#x27; compensation provisions for domestic workers.&quot; Along with education, fair practices in employment and housing became Hawkins&#x27;s major causes. He received little support at the time for these measures from the Democratic Party, however. Nevertheless, he was able to get some measures passed, including his fair-housing law, which prohibited discrimination by any builders that received federal funds. Hawkins was also a delegate to the National Conventions of 1940, 1944 and 1960, as well as an electoral college presidential elector from California in 1944. In 1958, Hawkins sought to be Speaker of the California State Assembly, which was the second-most powerful position in the state, after the Governor of California. Hawkins lost to Ralph M. Brown, but was made chairman of the powerful Rules Committee. Had Hawkins succeeded, he would have become the first African-American Speaker in California history, a feat that Willie Brown would achieve in 1980. In 1962, Hawkins won a newly created majority-black congressional district encompassing central Los Angeles With an endorsement from John F. Kennedy, Hawkins easily won the primary and the general election. After the election, Hawkins remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s like shifting gears—from the oldest man in the Assembly in years of service to a freshman in Congress.&quot;

=== U.S. Congress ===

From 1963 to 1991, Hawkins represented California&#x27;s 21st District (1963–1975), and the 29th District (1975–1991), covering southern Los Angeles County, in Congress. Hawkins was consistently elected with over 80% of the vote in his Democratic-friendly district. He was the first black representative to be elected from west of the Mississippi River.

Hawkins was a strong supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society. Early in his congressional career, he authored legislation including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hawkins was a strong supporter of civil rights, and he toured the South in 1964 to advocate for African-American voter registration.

Five days after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, the Watts Riots occurred in Hawkins&#x27;s district. It was the first of many race riots in the 1960s. Hawkins urged his colleagues in Congress to increase antipoverty funds, but he did not condone the violence. Due to his light skin and heightened racial tensions, Hawkins had to be careful when he visited his district shortly after the riots. The riots stalled the Great Society, particularly over the fair housing; blacks who benefited from Great Society laws were blamed as being harmful to the &quot;law and order&quot; of America, particularly if they were allowed to live next to whites. Fair housing was still an unpopular issue in America: Democratic Senate nominee Pierre Salinger lost to Republican George Murphy in California over the issue, marking the only Republican pickup amid Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s crushing presidential victory over anti-Civil Rights Act Barry Goldwater in 1964. Open housing reform seemed next on the Great Society list after the Voting Rights Act was signed, but the Watts Riot put it on hold. It was not passed until after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

On the Vietnam War, Hawkins initially agreed with President Johnson. In 1964, both insisted that the war undermined the Great Society and that the United States could not &quot;impose our way of life on other people.&quot; When it became clear that South Vietnam was not stable enough to survive without American backing, Hawkins increased his criticism of the war. After touring South Vietnam June 1970, Hawkins and fellow Democratic Representative William Anderson drafted a House Resolution urging Congress to &quot;condemn the cruel and inhumane treatment&quot; of prisoners in South Vietnam. Anderson and Hawkins had visited South Vietnam with nine other congressmen, but they were the only two to visit a civilian South Vietnamese prison on Con Son Island, which they described as being akin to &quot;tiger cages.&quot; The two Representatives also pressured President Nixon to send an independent task force to investigate the prison and &quot;prevent further degradation and death.&quot;
Hawkins was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and served as vice chairman during its first term (1971–1973). Hawkins did not play a significant role in the CBC, as he preferred to focus on legislation rather than use Congress as a bully pulpit like other African Americans such as Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Bill Clay, and Ron Dellums; Hawkins argued that there needed to be &quot;clearer thinking and fewer exhibitionists in the civil rights movement.&quot; During this time, Hawkins succeeded in restoring honorable discharges to the 170 black soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment who had been falsely accused of a public disturbance in Brownsville, Texas, in 1906, and removed from the Army. Unlike other CBC members, he sought cooperation from organized labor and white ethnics in order to make his agenda more likely to pass into law. In 1980, Hawkins criticized the CBC as &quot;85 percent social and 15 percent business.&quot;

Aside from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, laws that Hawkins was instrumental in passing include: the 1974 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a law that provided certain protections to young criminal offenders; the 1978 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act; and the 1978 Pregnancy Disability Act, which aimed to prevent discrimination against women on the basis of pregnancy and of which Hawkins said, &quot;we have the opportunity to ensure that genuine equality in the American labor force is more than an illusion and that pregnancy will no longer be the basis of unfavorable treatment of working women.&quot; Hawkins is known best of all for the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, which Hawkins sponsored in 1977 alongside the legendary Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. The bill gave the U.S. government the goal of providing full employment; it also ordered that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board must provide Congress with testimony on the state of the economy. However, by the time that the bill made it to President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s desk, &quot;the legislation was clearly symbolic.&quot; Hawkins later authored landmark legislation such as the Job Training Partnership Act and the 1988 School Improvement Act. He became chair of the House Education and Labor Committee in 1984.

Hawkins was frustrated from the relative lack of success that he achieved during the 1980s&#x27; presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. They were the most conservative presidents since the 1920s, and members of his own party were moving to the right and viewed Hawkins&#x27;s old-school New Dealer stance as outdated. His greatest setback was George H. W. Bush&#x27;s veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, sometimes called the Hawkins-Kennedy Civil Rights Act. It would have reversed six Supreme Court decisions made in the previous year that had shifted the burden of proof of discriminating hiring practices of minorities or women from the employer to the employee. It remains the only successful veto of a civil rights act in United States history. Hawkins retired in January 1991. Bush would sign a less expansive bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, after Hawkins&#x27;s retirement.

==Later life ==
Hawkins retired from Congress in 1991, having never lost an election in his 58-year career. He died at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 10, 2007; aged 100, he was the oldest living person to have served in Congress at the time of his death, and the eighth member of Congress to have become a centenarian. Hawkins&#x27;s death left the former Alabama Republican Representative Arthur Glenn Andrews (1909–2008) as the oldest living former House member.

== Legacy ==
The Augustus F. Hawkins Nature Park was built in 2000 in a highly urbanized area of southern Los Angeles. The cost was $4.5 million and was financed largely by city, county, and state bond measures. The park encompasses 8.5 acres and features the Evan Frankel Discovery Center, which includes natural history and environmental interpretive displays. The Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program is a federal grants program supporting diversification of the U.S. teaching force.

Augustus F. Hawkins High School in Los Angeles, which opened in 2012, is named in his honor.

<text>U.S. Route 84 (US 84) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway that started as a short Georgia–Alabama route in the original 1926 scheme. Later, in 1941, it had been extended all the way to Colorado. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is a short distance east of Midway, Georgia, at an Interchange with I-95. The road continues toward the nearby Atlantic Ocean as a county road. Its western terminus is in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, at an intersection with US 160.

The section from Brunswick, Georgia, to Roscoe, Texas, has been designated by five state legislatures as part of the El Camino East–West Corridor. The designation was in recognition of its history as a migration route from the Atlantic coast to the present Mexican border, one of the routes that Spanish settlers called &quot;El Camino Real&quot;. (In Louisiana, the route was called the Harrisonburg Road.) The designation is intended to promote the route for both tourism and NAFTA-facilitated trade with Mexico. States are asking for federal funds to widen the US 84 El Camino East–West Corridor.

==Route description==

===Colorado===


The northern terminus of US 84, Pagosa Springs, Colorado, was made famous by C. W. McCall in the 1975 song and album &quot;Wolf Creek Pass&quot;. US 84 actually ends approximately east of downtown Pagosa Springs at a T-intersection with US 160 (Main Street).

South of Pagosa Springs, the of the Colorado section of US 84 pass through a portion of San Juan National Forest. The highway climbs Confar Hill, a drainage divide between the Rio Blanco and Navajo River, before descending into the village of Chromo and passing into New Mexico.

===New Mexico===

US 84 enters Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, south of its terminus at US 160. About south of the Colorado–New Mexico state line, US 64 comes from the west and runs concurrently with US 84 for the next . Only east of this intersection, the concurrency crosses the Continental Divide at Sargent Pass, elevation above sea level or more than lower than Wolf Creek Pass, the next Continental Divide highway pass to the north. Therefore, only of US 84 are located west of the Continental Divide. About east of the intersection, US 64/US 84 enters the town of Chama. At a T-intersection, New Mexico State Road 17 enters from the north and terminates at said intersection, while US 64 and US 84 enter from the south and west.

After heading south from Chama, US 64 and US 84 combine for about to Tierra Amarilla, where US 64 departs from US 84 and heads southeast, while US 84 continues south. About down the road, US 84 is joined by US 285 south of the small community of Chili. About further, US 84/US 285 enters the city of Española from the north as North Paseo de Onate Street. At the south end of the town, US 84/US 285 becomes the Santa Fe Highway and an expressway. About further, US 84/US 285 becomes a limited-access freeway. Another further south, the two return to surface street status, and then travel past downtown Santa Fe via St. Francis Drive. On the south side of Santa Fe at I-25&#x27;s exit 282A, US 84/US 285 merges with northbound I-25/US 85. The freeway heads east and slightly to the south to avoid the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Just before turning north, US 285 exits the freeway at exit 290 and continues south. After winding north and south, the freeway finally begins heading solely north, and US 84 exits about later at exitv339 near Romeroville and travels in an east/southeast direction, while I-25/US 85 continues north to Colorado. Following a path southeast and then south for , US 84 merges with I-40 (and Historic US 66) at I-40&#x27;s exit 256. After I-40/US 84 enters Santa Rosa. About from its confluence with I-40, US 84 diverges at exit 277.

The highway then travels south/southeast for until merging with US 60 in downtown Fort Sumner. From the intersection with US 60, US 60/US 84 travels east, passing through Taiban and Melrose before intersecting US 70 after in Clovis. From the intersection with US 70, US 60/US 70/US 84 travels east entering Texico. Here, about before the Texas–New Mexico state line, US 60 splits from US 70/US 84 as US 70/US 84 continues east into Farwell, Texas. Despite being an east-west route, US 84 is signed north-south between Fort Sumner and the Colorado state line.

===Texas===


US 70/US 84 crosses into Texas at Farwell. After passing through Farwell, US 70/US 84 veers to the southeast, continuing concurrently until Muleshoe. From Muleshoe, US 70 leaves the route, while US 84 continues on a southeasterly direction across the level plains of the Llano Estacado. Along this stretch, US 84 travels parallel to the BNSF Railway, crosses a sandy section called the Muleshoe Dunes, and then passes Littlefield, the birthplace of country singer Waylon Jennings. US 84 continues in a southeasterly direction through cotton fields and small towns such as Anton and Shallowater, eventually entering Lubbock, the largest city in the South Plains and the birthplace of Buddy Holly. Signed as Avenue Q, US 84 passes through the heart of downtown Lubbock before making a sharp easterly turn on the southeast side of the city, where it is known as the Slaton Highway. After bypassing the town of Slaton, US 84 makes another gentle turn to the east, following a generally southeasterly heading through Post, Snyder, and Roscoe, where it merges with I-20.

From this point, US 84 follows I-20, unsigned, until Abilene, where it leaves the Interstate, making a hard southerly turn and forming the western side of a three-quarter loop around the city (along with US 83 and US 277). From the south side of Abilene, US 84 continues concurrently with US 83 until the two highways split about northeast of Tuscola, and though still signed as east–west, maintains a due north–south heading. US 84 makes a gentle turn back to the southeast at Lawn, following this bearing until Santa Anna, where it merges with US 67 and takes a more due easterly turn.

US 84 merges with US 183 at Brownwood and once again turns to the southeast. The highway continues concurrently until Goldthwaite, where it leaves US 183 and yet again makes a sharp turn to the east. It follows this heading all the way to McGregor. From McGregor, the highway makes a turn to the northeast to Woodway; this stretch of US 84 is also signed as the George W. Bush Parkway. US 84 then crosses into Waco, going past the downtown area along Waco Drive and then northeast into the suburb of Bellmead. After a brief concurrency with State Highway 31 (SH 31) through Bellmead, US 84 continues fairly due east passing through Mexia. Then at Teague, it takes yet another turn to the north before turning back to the east at an intersection with I-45 in Fairfield.

US 84 merges with US 79 and makes another northerly turn southwest of Palestine. The highway splits from US 79 just southwest of downtown before making another turn eastward and passing through town. It follows a gentle northeasterly path all the way to Timpson, passing through the towns of Maydelle; Rusk, where it intersects with US 69; Reklaw; Mount Enterprise, where it intersects US 259; and Timpson, where it merges with US 59 and serves as the northern terminus of SH 87. From Timpson to Tenaha, it briefly runs concurrently with US 59 until its intersection with US 96. From this point, US 84 continues its easterly path through to rest of eastern Texas, passing through Joaquin before crossing into Louisiana across the Sabine River into the town of Logansport.

===Louisiana===


Once the highway leaves Logansport, it travels through Stanley and then northeast into Mansfield, where it merges for a brief stretch with US 171. It continues east, crossing under I-49, until it reaches Grand Bayou, where it turns to the southeast, merging with Louisiana Highway 1 (LA 1). After approximately , it turns back again to the east, where it merges with US 71 in Coushatta and stays with that highway until Clarence. It then heads northeast towards Winnfield, where it merges for a short time with US 167. It turns to the northeast towards Joyce, then begins a long stretch to the southeast, passing through Tullos, where it intersects US 165, through the parish seat of Jena, and continues in that direction until it crosses into Catahoula Parish. It bears east through Jonesville until Ferriday, where it merges with US 425. It then heads southeast through Vidalia where it crosses the Mississippi River into Natchez, Mississippi.

===Mississippi===

The four-lane Natchez–Vidalia Bridge, crossing the Mississippi River, carries US 84 and US 425 into Natchez. Here, it merges with US 61, which marks the southern terminus of US 425. It then travels approximately to the northeast where it reaches the western terminus of US 98 at Washington, where it is paired with US 98 until Bude and Meadville. The road continues east, crossing under I-55 and heads east towards Collins. US 84 travels concurrently with I-59 for a short distance through Laurel. It then heads east to Waynesboro and continues to the Alabama state line.

===Alabama===
In Alabama, US 84 is paired with unsigned State Route 12 (SR 12). Parts of the route have been widened in recent years to four-lane status. The most significant exist from River Falls eastward to Andalusia, near Opp where a recent bypass of the downtown area now carries US 84 in a southern arc around the town, and from Enterprise eastward thru Daleville and on to the Dothan area and then the Georgia state line at the Chattahoochee River in Saffold.

US 84 has brief stretches concurrent with other US Highways in Alabama. US 84 shares a routing with US 31 from just southwest of Evergreen to a few miles east of town. It briefly shares a routing with US 29 in the city of Andalusia. It also shares a routing with US 331 near Opp. At Dothan, US 84 shares a concurrency with US 231 and US 431 on the Ross Clark Circle which is the circular bypass of downtown.

US 84 crosses three major navigable waterways in Alabama. They are the Tombigbee River at Coffeeville, the Alabama River at Claiborne, and the Chattahoochee River at the Alabama–Georgia state line. US 84 passes through Enterprise and Daleville which are both very near Fort Novosel which is the United States Army&#x27;s helicopter training school. Most of US 84 in Alabama traverses the Gulf Coastal Plain which is relatively lowlying land with some sand content. The area is heavily agricultural with little heavy industry. Dothan is the largest city in Alabama traversed by US 84 and it is the business and agricultural center of Southeast Alabama. The area is commonly referred to as the Wiregrass Region.

===Georgia===

 After entering Georgia from Alabama west of Jakin, Georgia, the route travels through the southern portion of the state, meeting its eastern terminus at I-95 east of Midway. US 84 through Georgia is also known as the Wiregrass Georgia Parkway. After entering the state from Alabama, US 84 travels east to Donalsonville to Bainbridge. The routes travels around the city to the south to a freeway bypass, cosigned with US 27/SR 1. The route continues east through Cairo to Thomasville, where it bypasses downtown to the north and east, cosigned with US 319, then US 19/SR 3/SR 300. The route continues east to Quitman, where it becomes cosigned with US 221 east, past its interchange with I-75, to Valdosta. In Valdosta, US 221 departs, and US 84 continues east-northeast to Waycross, where it is briefly cosigned with US 1, US 23, and US 82. US 84 continues northeast from Waycross, passing through Blackshear before arriving in Jesup. In Jesup, the route becomes cosigned with US 25 and US 301 northeast to Ludowici. In Ludowici, US 25/US 301 departs to the northwest, and US 84 continues northeast to Hinesville. In Hinesville, the route becomes cosigned with SR 196 and takes a turn to the east. After a short distance, SR 196 departs, and US 84/SR 38 continues east to its eastern terminus at exit 76 on I-95 east of Midway.

==History==
When originally designated in 1926, US 84 was a much shorter route spanning from Dothan, Alabama, to Brunswick, Georgia. In 1934, the highway was extended west to Farwell, Texas, before its subsequent extension northwest into Colorado. (According to maps and documents held at the Alabama Department of Transportation library in Montgomery, the section between Natchez, Mississippi, and Wagarville, Alabama had been planned as US 86 the year before.)

===Louisiana===
Throughout Louisiana, US 84 was largely aligned with the existing SR 6. The major exception was the portion west of Clarence, where SR 6 followed a more southern path from the Texas line through Natchitoches. Additionally, US 84 took advantage of a shorter route between Winnfield and Jena that passed through Tullos rather than Olla. The only major realignment since 1934 occurred about 1955 when an improved road was opened between Mansfield and Coushatta that passed through Grand Bayou rather than Evelyn. That year, the state highway designations co-signed with US 84 were discontinued as part of the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.

===Mississippi–Alabama===
Upon its extension, US 84 originally looped southeast on US 45 from Waynesboro to State Line, Mississippi, then east along SR 56 to Wagarville, Alabama, and back to the northeast via US 43 to Grove Hill. This route was bypassed in the 1960s when a more direct connection between Waynesboro and Grove Hill was established.

===Georgia===
The eastern ends of US 84 and US 82 were swapped in 1989 after the roads around Waycross, were reconfigured.

<doc id="445311" wikidata="Q278163" url="?curid=445311" title="List of municipalities in Indiana">
<text>Indiana is a state located in the Midwestern United States. As of the 2021 census estimate, the state had 6,805,985 residents. There are 569 municipalities.

Under Indiana law, a municipality must have a minimum of 2,000 people to incorporate as a city. Except as noted, all cities are &quot;third-class&quot; cities with a seven-member city council and an elected clerk-treasurer. &quot;Second-class&quot; cities had a population of at least 34,000 and up to 600,000 at time of designation, and have a nine-member city council and an elected clerk. Indianapolis is the only &quot;first-class&quot; city in Indiana under state law, making it subject to a consolidated city-county government known as Unigov. A town is differentiated from a city in that a town can not become a city until it has a population of at least 2,000. The form of government is also different from that of a city in that the council is both the legislative and executive branches of government. The mayor is selected by the council from within its ranks and operates as a first among equals.

<text>Tullio Moneta (9 May 1937 – 31 March 2022) was an Italian actor and mercenary. He acted in 15 films between 1970 and 1990, starring in the feature film &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Share&quot;. He also played a role in the Afrikaans language film &quot; Aanslag op Kariba&quot; (which means attack on (the) Kariba (dam)) in 1973, produced by Brigadiers Films. He was, together with Mike Hoare, the military advisor for the film &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978).

In November 1981 Moneta was second-in-command to Mike Hoare when the latter led the 1981 Seychelles coup d&#x27;état attempt at Mahe Airport in the Seychelles and was sentenced to five years in prison; he was released soon after. 

Moneta latterly lived in Durban, South Africa. He died on 31 March 2022, at the age of 84.

<doc id="445323" wikidata="Q2390653" url="?curid=445323" title="Gongora">
<text>Gongora, abbreviated Gga in horticultural trade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It consists of 65 species known from Central America, Trinidad, and tropical South America, with most species found in Colombia. They grow across a wide geographical range, from wet forests at sea level, to mountainous regions in the Andes, as high as 1,800 m.

The name comes from Antonio Caballero y Gongora, a viceroy of New Granada (Colombia and Ecuador) and the governor of Peru during the Ruiz and Pavón botanical expedition.

&quot;Gongora&quot; was one of the first orchids described by a European. Several new &quot;Gongora&quot; orchids have been discovered in the 2000s-2010s, whilst many others have been re-grouped under different classifications. Yet there is still some confusion; Many species lack &quot;appropriate&quot; descriptions. Some species, such as &quot;Gongora portentosa&quot; and &quot;Gongora superflua&quot;, are extremely isolated in population. DNA fingerprinting will, in time, contribute to an exact taxonomy of this genus.

All species in this genus are epiphytes, with a sympodial growth. The white aerial roots are very thin, growing in a dense mound. Some roots will travel, seeking out additional anchoring and nutrients, growing vertically/sideways rather than simply hanging down. This specialisation helps in forming the anchorage of the plant to its &quot;host&quot; tree. 

Many of these orchids are found in association with ant nests; the ants are, in turn, attracted to nectar droplets from the plant, as well as any pest insects (aphid, mealybug, etc.) that may be present on the orchid. However, the ants do not prey on these pests; the bugs suck sap from the orchid (or any plant), and ultimately create waste excrement in the form of a &quot;sweet&quot; liquid, referred to as &quot;honeydew&quot;. Ants find this addicting; they will meticulously maintain the pest insect&#x27;s population by caring for them, and guarding them, on the orchid plant. Whenever an ant is fatigued, they will simply approach an aphid/mealybug and &quot;tap&quot; its abdomen, communicating they are ready to &quot;feed&quot;.

The conical pseudobulbs are ridged and are about 8 cm long. In some species, such as &quot;Gongora similis&quot;, the pseudobulb can produce up to six inflorescences in succession. Two alternate leaves originate from the end of each pseudobulb. The leaves are rather leathery and heavily veined, growing to a length of about 30 cm.

The racemose inflorescence grows from the base of the pseudobulbs. The stem first grows upright, but bends early in development and becomes pendulous. The numerous flowers hang upside down, with the lip upwards. The almost circularly bent pedicels are characteristic of this genus. There are two lateral sepals and one dorsal sepal. The blooms of several species are waxy. The flowers of many species have distinctive fragrances. Some smell like unburned candle wax, others like nutmeg, cardamom, or cinnamon. The pollinia are superposed on a stipe (a cellular pollinium stalk), which is held by a viscid disc.

The genus is closely related to &quot;Cirrhaea&quot;. For other relatives see also &quot;Stanhopeinae&quot; &amp; &quot;Coeliopsidinae&quot;.

== Species ==
According to Rod Rice in &quot;Infragen. Rev. Gen. Gongora&quot; (2002, 2003) the genus &quot;Gongora&quot; can be classified into subgenera and sections as follows:

Subgenus Gongora 
*Section Aceras with four species 
*Section Gongora with about 30-33 species [G. atropurpurea, G. catilligera, G. latisepala, G. odoratissima, G. rufescens] 
*Section Gratulabunda with four species 
*Section Grossa with five species 
*Section Truncata with nine species [G. charontis, G. dressleri,G. longipes, G. tracyana] 
Subgenus Portentosa
*one section with at least five species [G. escobariana, G. garayana, G. portentosa, G. sanderiana] 
Subgenus Acropera 
*Section Acropera with one species 
*Section Armeniaca with two species and one to two subspecies 
*Section Cassidea with four species [G. amparoana, G. cassidea, G. galeata, G. tridentata]

* Every cyclic group is locally cyclic, and every locally cyclic group is abelian.
* Every finitely-generated locally cyclic group is cyclic.
* Every subgroup and quotient group of a locally cyclic group is locally cyclic.
* Every homomorphic image of a locally cyclic group is locally cyclic.
* A group is locally cyclic if and only if every pair of elements in the group generates a cyclic group.
* A group is locally cyclic if and only if its lattice of subgroups is distributive .

<text>The Al Murrah () (singular &#x27;Al Marri&#x27;) is an Arab tribe descended from the well-known Banu Yam tribe. They mainly reside in countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. Historically, Al Murrah was a tribe of camel-herding nomads, who controlled and travelled through a vast area of the Arabian Peninsula.

Seven clans make up the Saudi branch of the Al Murrah. Travelling as much as each year, the tribe comprises approximately 15,000 individuals.

==Population==

===Qatar===
Historically, the Al Murrah tribe made up a large proportion of Qatar&#x27;s ethnic population.

In 1885, a number of Al Murrah tribespeople, along with several members from the Bani Hajer tribe, renounced their allegiance to Qatar and departed from the country. The two families were joined by the Ajman tribe, whom were known to harbor hostilities toward Qatar and regularly engage in skirmishes with its inhabitants. While the group was encamped in an area between Qatar and Oman, a regiment of 1,200 partisans composed of branches of Al Murrah and Bani Hajer loyal to the sheikh of Qatar engaged the group. Although the three tribes boasted a combined force of 2,000 men and outnumbered the opposition, they were inflicted with heavy losses.

A majority of tribe members were strong supporters of Sheikh Khalifa Al Thani, the former Emir of Qatar who was deposed in 1995 in a coup by his son. Eight months after the coup, 119 Al Murrah members attempted to overthrow the new Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Al Thani, but failed. In February 2000, 19 of the alleged perpetrators had been sentenced to death, 33 were sentenced to life in prison, and the rest were acquitted. However, none of those sentenced to death were executed.

In 2017 Qatar revoked the citizenship of the sheikh and 54 tribespeople. Al Murrah are friendly to UAE and Saudi Arabia and negative to the current regime in Iran.

Al Murrah tribespeople were not allowed to run for the 2021 Qatari general election, which led to protests.

<text>Dinah Shore (born Frances Rose Shore; February 29, 1916 – February 24, 1994) was an American singer, actress, and talk show host. Shore rose to prominence as a recording artist during the Big Band era. Born in Winchester, Tennessee and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, she achieved even greater success a decade later in television, mainly as the host of a series of variety programs for the Chevrolet automobile company.

After failing singing auditions for the bands of Benny Goodman, and both Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Shore struck out on her own. She became the first singer of her era to achieve huge solo success. She had a string of eighty charted popular hits, spanning from 1940 to 1957, and after appearing in a handful of feature films, she went on to a four-decade career in American television. She starred in her own music and variety shows from 1951 through 1963 and hosted two talk shows in the 1970s. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked her at number 16 on their list of the top 50 television stars of all time. Stylistically, Shore was compared to two singers who followed her in the mid-to-late 1940s and early 1950s, Jo Stafford and Patti Page.

==Early life==
Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Rose Shore was born on February 29, 1916, to Russian-Jewish immigrant shopkeepers, Anna (née Stein) and Solomon Shore, in Winchester, Tennessee. She had an elder sister, eight years her senior, Elizabeth, known as &quot;Bessie&quot;. When Fanny was eighteen months old, she was stricken with polio (infantile paralysis). The only known treatment was bed rest and sometimes more extreme care if the child was severely compromised. Her mother provided extensive care for her, which included regular therapeutic massage and a strict exercise program. She recovered, but sustained a deformed foot and limp. Fanny loved to sing as a small child; her mother, a contralto with operatic aspirations, encouraged her. Her father often took her to his store, where she would perform impromptu songs for the customers.

In 1924, the Shore family moved to McMinnville, Tennessee, where her father had opened a department store. By her fifth-grade year, the family had moved to Nashville, where she completed elementary school. Although shy because of her limp, she became actively involved in sports, was a cheerleader at Nashville&#x27;s Hume-Fogg High School, and was involved in other activities.

When Shore was 16, her mother died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Pursuing her education, Shore enrolled at Vanderbilt University, where she participated in many events and activities, including the Chi chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. She graduated from the university in 1938 with a degree in sociology. She visited the Grand Ole Opry and made her radio debut on Nashville&#x27;s WSM radio station.

Shore decided to return to pursuing her career in singing, moving to New York City to audition for orchestras and radio stations. At first she went there on a summer break from Vanderbilt, and after graduation, for good. In many of her auditions, she sang the popular song &quot;Dinah&quot;. When disc jockey Martin Block could not remember her name, he called her the &quot;Dinah girl&quot;, and soon after the name stuck, becoming her stage name. She eventually was hired as a vocalist at radio station WNEW, where she sang with Frank Sinatra. She recorded and performed with the Xavier Cugat orchestra, and signed a recording contract with RCA Victor Records in 1940.

==Music career==
===1940s===
In March 1939, Shore debuted on national radio on the Sunday-afternoon CBS Radio program, &quot;Ben Bernie&#x27;s Orchestra&quot;. In February 1940, she became a featured vocalist on the NBC Radio program &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street&quot;, a showcase for traditional Dixieland and blues songs. With her, the program became so popular, it was moved from 4:30 Sunday afternoon to a 9:00 Monday night time slot in September. In her primetime debut for &quot;the music of the Three Bs, Barrelhouse, Boogie-woogie, and the Blues&quot;, she was introduced as &quot;Mademoiselle Dinah &#x27;Diva&#x27; Shore, who starts a fire by rubbing two notes together!&quot; She recorded with the two &quot;Basin Street&quot; bands for RCA Victor; one of her records was the eponymous &quot;Dinah&#x27;s Blues&quot;.

Shore&#x27;s singing came to the attention of Eddie Cantor. He signed her as a regular on his radio show, &quot;Time to Smile&quot;, in 1940. Shore credits him for teaching her self-confidence, comedic timing, and the ways of connecting with an audience. In 1943, Shore appeared in her first movie, &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, starring Cantor. In August 1944 she toured the European Theater of Operations hosted by Communications Zone commander Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee.

She soon went to another radio show, &quot;Paul Whiteman Presents&quot;. During this time, the United States was involved in World War II, and Shore became a favorite with the troops. She had hits, including &quot;Blues in the Night&quot;, &quot;Jim&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;d Be So Nice to Come Home To&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Alone&quot;, the first of her number-one hits. &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

Shore continued appearing in radio shows throughout the 1940s, including &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Eye Open House&quot; and &quot;Ford Radio Show&quot;. In early 1946, she moved to a new label, the CBS-owned Columbia Records. At Columbia, Shore enjoyed the greatest commercial success of her recording career, starting with her first Columbia single release, &quot;Shoo-Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy&quot;, and peaking with the most popular song of 1948, &quot;Buttons and Bows&quot;, (with Henri René &amp; Orchestra), which was number one for ten weeks, and her second million selling record. Other number-one hits at Columbia included &quot;The Gypsy&quot; and &quot;The Anniversary Song&quot;. Shore soon became a successful singing star with her own radio show, &quot;Call for Music&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS from February 13, 1948, to April 16, 1948, and on NBC from April 20, 1948, to June 29, 1948.

One of her most popular recordings was the holiday perennial &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; with Buddy Clark from 1949. The song was covered by many other artists, such as Ella Fitzgerald. Other hits during her four years at Columbia included &quot;Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside)&quot;, &quot;I Wish I Didn&#x27;t Love You So&quot;, &quot;(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; What Comes Natur&#x27;lly&quot;, and &quot;Dear Hearts and Gentle People&quot;. She was a regular with Jack Smith on his quarter-hour radio show on CBS from 1950 to 1951.

Shore was a musical guest in the films &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1944), and &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946) and had starring roles in Danny Kaye&#x27;s debut &quot;Up in Arms&quot; (1944) and &quot;Belle of the Yukon&quot; (1944). She lent her musical voice to two Disney films: &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; (1946) and &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947). Her last starring film role was for Paramount Pictures in &quot;Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick&quot; (1952).

===1950s===
In 1950, Shore returned to RCA Victor with a deal to record 100 sides for $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The hits kept coming, but with less frequency, and were not charting as high as in the 1940s. Shore&#x27;s biggest hits of this era were &quot;My Heart Cries for You&quot; and &quot;Sweet Violets&quot;, both peaking at number three in 1951. Several duets with Tony Martin did well, with &quot;A Penny a Kiss&quot; being the most popular, reaching number eight. was a 1953 hit, and her covers of &quot;Changing Partners&quot; and &quot;If I Give My Heart to You&quot; were popular top-20 hits. &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; and &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot; were top-20 hits from 1955.

&quot;Chantez, Chantez&quot; was her last top-20 hit, staying on the charts for over 20 weeks in 1957. Shore remained at RCA Victor until 1958, and during that time, released albums including &quot;Bouquet of Blues&quot;, &quot;Once in a While&quot;, and &quot;Vivacious&quot;, which were collections of singles with different orchestras and conductors such as Frank DeVol and Hugo Winterhalter. The studio albums &quot;Holding Hands at Midnight&quot;, from 1955, and &quot;Moments Like These&quot;, from 1958, recorded in stereo, with orchestra under the musical direction of Harry Zimmerman, who performed the same duties on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, were the exceptions.

===Recording career after the 1950s===
In 1959, Shore left RCA Victor for Capitol Records. Although she recorded only one minor hit for her new label (&quot;I Ain&#x27;t Down Yet&quot;, which peaked at 102 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; pop chart in 1960), the collaboration produced four &quot;theme albums&quot; that paired her with arranger Nelson Riddle (&quot;Dinah, Yes Indeed!&quot;), conductor and accompanist André Previn (&quot;Somebody Loves Me&quot; and &quot;Dinah Sings, Previn Plays&quot;), and jazz&#x27;s Red Norvo (&quot;Dinah Sings Some Blues with Red&quot;). Her final two Capitol albums were &quot;Dinah, Down Home&quot; and &quot;The Fabulous Hits (Newly Recorded)&quot;.

Shore was dropped by Capitol in 1962 and recorded only a handful of albums over the next two decades. She recorded &quot;Lower Basin Street Revisited&quot; for friend Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise label in 1965, &quot;Songs for Sometime Losers&quot; (Project 3, 1967), &quot;Country Feelin″&quot; (Decca, 1969), &quot;Once Upon A Summertime&quot; (Stanyan, 1975), and &quot;Dinah!&quot;, a double LP for Capitol in 1976. She recorded this album at the height of her talk show fame, and it featured her take on contemporary hits such as &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;, &quot;The Hungry Years&quot;, and &quot;Theme from &quot;Mahogany&quot; (Do You Know Where You&#x27;re Going To)&quot;. Her final studio album was released in 1979, &quot;Dinah!: I&#x27;ve Got a Song,&quot; for the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop.

==Acting career==
===Radio===

Shore starred in seven radio series of her own between 1941 and 1954. She made hundreds of guest appearances in shows including an episode of &quot;Suspense&quot; (&quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, May 5, 1952).

===Early television career===
Soon after Shore arrived in New York in 1937, aged 21, Shore made her first television appearances on experimental broadcasts for NBC over station W2XBS in New York (now WNBC). Twelve years later, in 1949, she made her commercial television debut on &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot; from Los Angeles over CBS and on Easter Sunday 1950, made a guest appearance on Bob Hope&#x27;s first network television show on NBC. After guest spots on many television shows, she was given her own program, &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot; on NBC on November 27, 1951. Vic Schoen was her musical director from 1951 to 1954, and also arranged music for her on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; (1954).

In 1956, Shore began hosting a monthly series of one-hour, full-color spectaculars as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Chevy Show&quot; series. These proved so popular, the show was renamed &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; the following season, with Shore becoming the full-time host, helming three of four weeks in the month. Broadcast live and in NBC&#x27;s famous &quot;Living Color&quot;, this variety show was one of the most popular of the 1950s and early 1960s and featured the television debuts of stars of the era, such as Yves Montand and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, and featured Shore in performances alongside Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, and Pearl Bailey. Tennessee Ernie Ford was a featured guest on one show, and she introduced him, tongue-in-cheek, as &quot;Tennessee Ernie CHEVROLET!!&quot; She also appeared as a guest on &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;.

&quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; ran through the 1960–61 season, after which Chevrolet dropped sponsorship, and Shore hosted a series of monthly broadcasts sponsored by the American Dairy Association and Green Stamps. Simply called &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;, Shore&#x27;s guests included Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Bing Crosby, Jack Lemmon, Boris Karloff, Betty Hutton, Art Carney, and a young Barbra Streisand. Over twelve seasons, from 1951 to 1963, Shore made 125 hour-long programs and 444 fifteen-minute shows. She always ended her televised programs by throwing an enthusiastic kiss directly to the cameras (and viewers) and exclaiming &quot;MWAH!&quot; to the audience.

Shore also appeared in four specials for ABC (in black-and-white) in the 1964–65 season. They were sponsored by the Purex Corporation.

===Later television career===
 From 1970 through 1980, Shore hosted two daytime programs, &quot;Dinah&#x27;s Place&quot; (1970–1974) on NBC and &quot;Dinah!&quot; (later &quot;Dinah and Friends&quot;) in syndication from 1974 through 1980 and a third cable program from 1989 to 1992. &quot;Dinah&#x27;s Place&quot;, primarily sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive (which later sponsored her women&#x27;s golf tournament), was a 30-minute Monday-through-Friday program broadcast at 10:00 am (ET) over NBC, her network home since 1939. Shore described this show as a &quot;Do-Show&quot; as opposed to a chat show because she would have her guests demonstrate an unexpected skill, for example, Frank Sinatra sharing his spaghetti sauce recipe, Vice President Spiro Agnew playing keyboard accompanying Shore on &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, or Ginger Rogers showing Shore how to throw a clay pot on a potter&#x27;s wheel.

Although &quot;Dinah&#x27;s Place&quot; featured famous guest stars, Shore often grilled lesser-known lifestyle experts on nutrition, exercise, or homemaking. Despite being one of the more popular programs in NBC&#x27;s morning lineup, dominating in the timeslot, facing out &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; reruns on CBS and local programming on ABC, this show left the air in 1974 after NBC sent a telegram to Shore congratulating her on her Emmy win – at the same time informing her the show was being cancelled, because it broke up a &quot;game show programming block&quot; and competition from &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; on CBS, which started two years earlier. Thus ended the network&#x27;s 35-year association with Shore. She returned that fall with &quot;Dinah!&quot;, a syndicated 90-minute daily talk show (also seen in a 60-minute version on some stations) that put the focus on top guest stars and entertainment. This show was seen as competition for Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin, whose shows had been on the air for ten years when &quot;Dinah!&quot; debuted. Frequent guests included entertainment figures (Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, and Jimmy Stewart), as well as regular contributors including lifestyle guru Dr. Wayne Dyer.

Unexpected rock music performance appearances included Tina Turner, David Bowie, and Iggy Pop. Shore also appeared on the Norman Lear comedy-soap opera &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; in April 1976. On the show, Shore interviewed country-singing character Loretta Haggars (played by Mary Kay Place) and included a controversial comment from Haggars during her appearance on a &quot;live&quot; airing of Shore&#x27;s talk show. Comedian Andy Kaufman in his Tony Clifton guise appeared on her show but did not, as rumored, throw eggs at Shore or pour them on her head.

Shore, with her Dixie drawl and demure manner, was identified with the South, and guests on her shows often commented on it. She spoofed this image by playing Melody in &quot;Went with the Wind!&quot;, the famous &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; parody for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. In the summer of 1976, Shore hosted &quot;Dinah and Her New Best Friends&quot;, an eight-week summer replacement series for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; which featured a cast of young hopefuls such as Diana Canova and Gary Mule Deer, along with such seasoned guests as Jean Stapleton and Linda Lavin. Shore guest-starred on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse Christmas Special&quot;, calling Pee-wee on his picturephone and singing &quot;The 12 Days of Christmas&quot;. Throughout the special, Pee-wee walks past the picturephone, only to hear her going past the original 12 days (&quot;...on the 500th day of Christmas ...&quot;).

Shore finished her television career by appearing on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1989, and hosting &quot;A Conversation with Dinah&quot; (1989–1992) on the cable network TNN (The Nashville Network). This half-hour show consisted of one-on-one interviews with celebrities and comedians (such as Bob Hope), former boyfriends (Burt Reynolds in a special one-hour episode), and political figures (former President Gerald Ford and his wife and former First Lady Betty Ford). In a coup, Shore got the first post-White House interview given by former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Around this time, she gained a contract as television spokeswoman for Holly Farms chicken. In the 1980s, Shore sang in Glendale Federal Bank television commercials. Her last television special, &quot;Dinah Comes Home&quot; (TNN 1991), brought Shore&#x27;s career full-circle, taking her back to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry, which she first visited some sixty years earlier. Shore won nine Emmys, a Peabody Award, and a Golden Globe Award. Shore&#x27;s talk shows sometimes included cooking segments, and she wrote cookbooks including &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Kitchen with Dinah&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
Shore was married to actor George Montgomery from 1943 to 1962. She gave birth to daughter Melissa Ann &quot;Missy&quot; Montgomery, in January 1948. Later the couple adopted a son, John David &quot;Jody&quot; Montgomery. Missy Montgomery also became an actress.

George Jacobs, in his memoir &quot;Mr. S&quot; about Frank Sinatra, for whom he worked as a longtime valet, claimed Shore and Sinatra had a long-standing affair in the 1950s. After her divorce in 1963 from Montgomery, she briefly married professional tennis player Maurice F. Smith. Her romances of the later 1960s involved comedian Dick Martin, singer Eddie Fisher, and actor Rod Taylor.

Starting in 1971, Shore had a six-year public romance with actor Burt Reynolds, who was 20 years her junior.

Her daughter, Melissa Montgomery, is the owner of the rights to most of Shore&#x27;s television series. In March 2003, PBS presented &quot;MWAH! The Best of The Dinah Shore Show 1956–1963&quot;, an hour-long special of early color videotaped footage of Shore in duets with guests Ella Fitzgerald, Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Pearl Bailey, George Burns, Groucho Marx, Peggy Lee, and Mahalia Jackson.

===Golf===
Shore, who played golf, was a longtime supporter of women&#x27;s professional golf. In 1972, she helped found the Colgate Dinah Shore Golf Tournament, which, in its current identity as the Chevron Championship, remains one of the major golf tournaments on the LPGA Tour. Until 2022, the tournament was held each spring at Mission Hills Country Club, near Shore&#x27;s former home in Palm Springs, California. The event moved to Texas in 2023 at the behest of the new sponsor. Mission Hills’ Dinah Shore Course is currently host of the Galleri Classic, a 78-man, 54-hole no-cut tournament on the PGA Tour Champions for players over 50.

Shore was the first female member of the Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles.

In acknowledgment of her contributions to golf, Shore was elected an honorary member of the LPGA Hall of Fame in 1994. Shore became a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame when it absorbed the LPGA Hall in 1998. She received the 1993 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA&#x27;s highest honor.

In 1963, she hired mid-century modern architect Donald Wexler to design her home in Palm Springs. The house was sold to actor Leonardo DiCaprio in 2014 for almost $5.5 million.

==Death==
In the spring of 1993, Shore was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died of complications from the disease at her home in Beverly Hills, California, on February 24, 1994. Her body was cremated the same day. Some of the ashes were interred in two memorial sites: the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California, and Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City). Other ashes went to relatives.

==Tributes==
In both Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage, California, streets are named after her. Her hometown of Winchester, Tennessee, honored her with Dinah Shore Boulevard. In 1989, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1991, she was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In 1996, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.

<text>K-Line Electric Trains is a brand name of O gauge and S gauge model railway locomotives, rolling stock, and buildings. Formerly the brand name under which Chapel Hill, North Carolina–based MDK Inc. sold its products, K-Line was then acquired by Sanda Kan, a Chinese toy manufacturer that formerly acted as K-Line&#x27;s subcontractor. Sanda Kan had licensed the use of the K-Line brand and intellectual property to Lionel. More recently, the Lionel license expired, and Sanda Kan sold the dies to several other companies, with some going to each of Atlas, Bachmann, and RMT.

==Establishment==

MDK was founded in 1975 by Maury D. Klein. Like competitor MTH Electric Trains, MDK was a large Lionel dealer, and its mail-order ads appeared in magazines such as Model Railroader in the late 1970s. MDK first used the K-Line name on a line of aftermarket Lionel-compatible tubular track as well as a copy of the A.C. Gilbert American Flyer line of two-rail S-Gauge track which Maury Klein acquired at Gilbert&#x27;s demise.

Louis Marx and Company&#x27;s final demise in 1978 led to MDK increasing the K-Line product line. In 1980, MDK purchased the tooling for Marx&#x27;s Plasticville-like Marxville buildings and accessories for train sets at bankruptcy. K-Line was able to recover additional Marx tooling by scavenging through old factories and warehouses. In an oft-repeated story, Maury Klein and his plant manager, Brent Chambers, found the molds for the Marx model 333 and 1829 4-6-2 locomotives in a dilapidated Fisher-Price warehouse near Buffalo, New York in 1984. The warehouse was unlighted, unheated, and was missing part of its roof.

By 1985, K-Line was producing O27 locomotives, cars, and figures from former Marx and Kusan tooling, and, with minor changes, began marketing them under the K-Line brand, competing with Lionel at the low end of the market. The dies mostly remained unchanged, with only the branding changing—for example, &quot;Marxville&quot; plastic buildings became &quot;K-Lineville&quot;. K-Line changed the couplers on the Marx-derived trains to make the cars compatible with Lionel, and, eventually, improved the graphics.

During the 1980s, K-Line filled much the same role that Marx had in the model railroading arena, supplying similar trains at a lower price than Lionel, but with less prestige. 

==Rise to power==

In the 1990s, K-Line was able to purchase more disused tooling from other manufacturers, allowing it to offer full-size O gauge for the first time, which it supplemented with pricier O gauge locomotives and rolling stock of its own design. Shifting its emphasis away from its budget offerings, K-line made some of the very best mass-produced O scale trains with their detailed models that it released in its latter years. In December 1996, about 20,000 model trains were recalled due to a potential fire hazard from the coil spring overheating if the train derails. 

Many collectors consider K-Line&#x27;s 1:48 scale offerings to be not only the best value, but also the very best mass-produced O gauge trains. K-Line&#x27;s heavyweight passenger cars are among those exhibited at The Brandywine River Museum Railroad&#x27;s annual &quot;A Brandywine Christmas&quot; celebration in Chadds Ford, PA. Its 21-inch extruded aluminum passenger cars are prized by 3-rail collectors and operators, and are often converted over to 2-rail &quot;scale&quot; operations. Lionel even began selling them for high dollars in 2010, before its license for K-Line products expired.

K-Line&#x27;s S gauge offerings provided budget-priced cars as well as the already produced track compatible with American Flyer-brand trains. Unlike its latest O scale products, K-Line&#x27;s marketing on its S gauge cars centered its price advantage over the competition. Most of the S gauge products were also made from old Marx O27 molds, with S gauge trucks replacing the O trucks.

The relationship between Lionel and K-Line had generally been more amicable than Lionel&#x27;s relationship with MTH, before the 2005 legal debacle with Lionel. Lionel had licensed TMCC to K-Line, and K-Line produced a number of repair manuals for postwar-era Lionel. K-Line has also produced commemorative cars celebrating some of Lionel&#x27;s significant anniversaries, whose graphics has sometimes caused confusion among collectors.

Because K-Line&#x27;s budget offerings remained almost unchanged from the old Marx designs, Marx collectors sometimes sourced spare parts from K-Line.

==Demise==

K-Line and Lionel were known to criticize one another&#x27;s offerings in print advertisements, and the two companies challenged one another in court as well. The two companies settled the suit on August 10, with K-Line agreeing to withdraw the infringing products by January 31, 2006 and paying a royalty to Lionel in the interim. K-Line also licensed some of its technology to Lionel, and reimbursed $700,000 of legal costs. Shortly thereafter the settlement fell apart and on August 23, 2005, MDK filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On October 27, K-Line and Lionel reached a new settlement, including a permanent injunction against manufacturing products containing the disputed technology, a $2 million damage claim in its bankruptcy case, and royalty-free access to several K-Line patents.

K-Line&#x27;s 2005 bankruptcy petition stated that its annual sales were between $7 and $8 million.

Over the next few months, K-Line&#x27;s operations slowed and there were numerous layoffs and rumors of potential purchasers, which were highly publicized among hobbyists. On February 16, 2006, Lionel announced it had purchased K-Line. Since Lionel was also in bankruptcy, the deal, which actually involved the purchase of K-Line by Sanda Kan, its Chinese subcontractor, followed by Sanda Kan&#x27;s licensing of the trademarks and intellectual property to Lionel, took several weeks to become final. The deal was finalized on April 18, 2006, and Lionel made the announcement the following day.

From 2006 through 2010, Lionel continued a limited run of K-Line trains called K-Line by Lionel, and issued separate K-Line by Lionel catalogs until 2010, when those products were folded into a section in Lionel&#x27;s own catalog.

During the first few years of this K-line by Lionel period, the extravagant passenger trains which competed directly with Lionel&#x27;s premium products were conspicuously absent, with the initial offerings focusing more on K-Line&#x27;s value line. Increasing amounts of scale products, including some of the well known 21-inch alumumum passenger cars, were added late in Lionel&#x27;s license period.

In a twist of fate, Lionel now has possession of the rights to produce American Flyer track, which until now was missing from its American Flyer train line.

More recently, the Lionel license expired, and Sanda Kan sold the dies to several other companies, with some going to each of Atlas, Bachmann, and RMT.

The village of Krithia and neighbouring hill of Achi Baba had to be captured in order for the British to advance up the Gallipoli peninsula to the forts that controlled passage of the Dardanelles straits. A small amount of ground was captured after two days of costly fighting, but the objectives remained out of reach.

==Prelude==
===Forces===
Following the failure of the First Battle of Krithia, the exhausted soldiers of the British 29th Division halted to consolidate their positions. They had to endure a number of Ottoman counter-attacks on 1 and 4 May. Similar counter-attacks were repulsed at the Anzac landing on 2 May so that General William Birdwood, commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps deemed his front sufficiently secure to enable two brigades to be moved to Helles for the next assault on Krithia. These were the Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, around 5,000 men.

Other British reinforcements included brigades from the Royal Naval Division and the 125th Brigade from the British 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The 87th and 88th Brigades of the 29th Division would once again be at the forefront of the attack. The Anzac brigades and General Herbert Cox&#x27;s 29th Indian Brigade (Indian Expeditionary Force G) would be in reserve. The commander at Helles, Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, was woefully lacking in shells for his artillery and those he did have were shrapnel shells which was ineffective against entrenched positions. The navy were somewhat ambitiously still hoarding shells for the anticipated assault on Constantinople.

The Ottomans and their German officers had also been reinforcing their defences around Krithia. Trenches and machine guns positions were hidden and camouflaged by design and placement.
According to Kiazim Pasha the following units were responsible for the defence of Krithia:
*1/ and 2/29th Regt (10th Div),
*2/56th Regt. (15th Div),
*2/19th Regt. (7th Div),
*1/ and 4/26th Regt. (9th Div), and
*15th Regt. (5th Div).

The infantry actually in front of Krithia on 8 May comprised:
*2/25th Regt. (9th Div),
*1/20th Regt. (7th Div), and
*2/56th Regt. (15th Div).

The Ottomans had seven field-batteries positioned on either side of Achi Baba, as well as a six-gun battery of howitzers.

===Terrain===

While Cape Helles is more forgiving than the wild terrain at Anzac Cove, the battlefield still presented difficulties to the attacking force. The ground looked flat but was riven by four large gullies, or &quot;deres&quot;, running from Achi Baba towards the Cape. On the west was Gully Ravine which was separated from the Aegean shore by Gully Spur. Moving east was Fir Tree Spur then Krithia Valley (also known as Krithia Nullah or Kirte Dere) then Krithia Spur then Kanli Dere then Kereves Spur then Kereves Dere which flows into the Dardanelles at Morto Bay. Krithia Spur was bare and exposed so was not favoured for attacks. Gully Spur and Fir Tree Spur offered some cover and so the majority of the British advances were made on these spurs and in the shelter of the gullies.

===Plan===
Like the first battle, the plan was for a general advance on a broad front across the peninsula. The attack was divided into three phases. The first phase involved a general advance of one mile across the entire front which would place the French, on the right of the line, astride Kereves Spur where they were to dig in. In the second phase, the British in the centre and on the left would pivot on the French position and sweep up Fir Tree Spur and Gully Spur then capture Krithia village. The third phase would be the capture of Achi Baba.

In the end, after three days of fighting, the Allies would abandon the battle without even completing the first phase. In fact, the greatest advance achieved was a mere . The plan was made despite the fact that the British had no clear idea where the Ottoman fortifications were. There was as yet no continuous system of trenches and aerial reconnaissance had failed to locate the defences. Consequently, the preliminary bombardments that were made before each advance were utterly ineffectual. Hunter-Weston also insisted that the attacks be made in broad daylight, fearing that an attack under the cover of darkness would become confused. Having failed with this approach once during the first battle did not deter Hunter-Weston, and as the second battle progressed he would remain undeterred.

==Battle==
The Allied advance began later than scheduled, around 11:00 on 6 May, and was swiftly halted by strong Ottoman resistance. The 88th Brigade of the 29th Division advancing on Fir Tree Spur managed to capture Fir Tree Wood, and the 6th (Hood) Battalion of the British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division advanced strongly along Kanli Dere, but at all points on the line the gains were never more than . At no point were the Ottoman defences reached. The attack was resumed on 7 May; it used the same plan and produced largely the same results.

On the morning of 8 May, the 88th Brigade in front of Krithia on Fir Tree Spur was relieved by the New Zealanders who made yet another attempt which failed with huge losses. The Wellington, Canterbury and Auckland Battalions gained another through Fir Tree Wood to a place called the &#x27;Daisy Patch&#x27; before they became pinned down. Enfiladed on the left from Ottoman machine guns in Gully Ravine, they could neither advance nor withdraw and still had no sight of the Ottoman positions.

Despite their predicament, Hunter-Weston ordered the New Zealanders, including the Otago Battalion in reserve, to resume that attack at 17:30. The brigade commander, Colonel Francis Johnston, protested but Hunter-Weston insisted the attack proceed. However, General Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, who had landed at Helles to oversee the battle, ordered a general advance to be made at 17:30 along the entire front with the aim of capturing Krithia and Achi Baba.

The Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier-General M&#x27;Cay, was given 35 minutes warning that it was about to join the attack. The Australians were to advance along Krithia Spur between the right flank of the New Zealand brigade and the edge of Kanli Dere, and had to travel up to from their reserve position just to reach the start line at &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Trench&quot;. The brigade managed to advance a further beyond the start line, suffering 50% casualties in the process.

The New Zealand brigade made another attempt to cross the Daisy Patch, and some troops managed to actually sight the Ottoman trenches. On the right, the French resumed their advance at 18:00 and made good progress, reaching the Ottoman trenches on Kereves Dere. They managed to capture and hold Bouchet Redoubt but were forced back everywhere else.

==Aftermath==
About ⅓ of the Allied soldiers who fought in the battle became casualties. General Hamilton could ill-afford such losses as they made it difficult enough to hold the little ground he had, let alone continue to capture more. The poor planning of the battle extended to the medical provisions for the wounded which were woeful. The few stretcher bearers that were available often had to carry their burdens all the way to the beach as there was no intermediate collecting station with wagon transport. The hospital ship arrangements were also inadequate so that once the wounded were taken off the beach they would have trouble finding a ship prepared to take them on board.

With the failure of the second battle, Hamilton made a request to the British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, for an additional four divisions. He was promised the British 52nd (Lowland) Division but would not receive any more until August. Another attempt to capture Krithia would not be made until early June.

<doc id="445353" wikidata="Q1417936" url="?curid=445353" title="No Control (Bad Religion album)">
<text>No Control is the fourth studio album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on November 2, 1989, through Epitaph Records. Bad Religion began work on the album while touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Suffer&quot; (1988). &quot;No Control&quot; is stylistically faster than its predecessor, owing more to hardcore punk. Additionally, it was the first Bad Religion album not to feature a lineup change from the previous album.

&quot;No Control&quot; brought Bad Religion a small amount of success in Southern California as the band started to gather a following. By 1992, about 80,000 copies were sold and it is often considered to be a landmark in hardcore punk. It contains many of the band&#x27;s live staples, such as &quot;Change of Ideas&quot;, &quot;Big Bang&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot;, &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like&quot;, &quot;Automatic Man&quot;, &quot;I Want to Conquer the World&quot;, &quot;Sanity&quot; and &quot;You&quot;. Up until 2019, the only songs from &quot;No Control&quot; that had never been performed live were &quot;Progress&quot; and &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Stop&quot;. The songs were live debuted when Bad Religion played the album in its entirety at the Roxy on April 5, 2019.

== Background and recording ==
After a long-term hiatus, Bad Religion reformed in 1987 with a new lineup, releasing the studio album &quot;Suffer&quot; in 1988. Although &quot;Suffer&quot; was not a commercial success, the band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim with that album and it managed to sell 4,000 copies. While Bad Religion continued touring in support of &quot;Suffer&quot;, Greg Graffin and Brett Gurewitz began writing songs in late 1988/early 1989 for the band&#x27;s next record. Bassist Jay Bentley commented on the making of &quot;No Control&quot;, stating that &quot;songs were being written all the time. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say an &#x27;album&#x27;s worth&#x27;, but during the U.S. and subsequent European tour into &#x27;89, lots of ideas were coming to fruition. I would think that more songs were written during the down time between tours and &#x27;perfected&#x27; on the road.&quot; Recording for &quot;No Control&quot; took place in June 1989 at Westbeach Recorders, where &quot;Suffer&quot; was made, and it was the band&#x27;s first experience recording an album on a half-inch two track. Gurewitz noted that he put every track through a compellor by using Aphex Systems, then, having completed this, he decided he hated the &quot;weird sound&quot; this had produced. As a result, he recalls spending a great deal of effort during the mixing stage to remove the compression. The overall result was an &quot;aggressive and distinctive&quot; sound which he now favors. Contrary to rumor, &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot; (which appears on &quot;Against the Grain&quot; and again on &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;) was not written and recorded for this album.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;No Control&quot; was released through Epitaph Records on November 2, 1989. By the time it was released, Bad Religion had become one of the most critically praised hardcore punk bands of the time, in spite of lack of mainstream success. 12,000 copies of &quot;No Control&quot; were originally shipped, and later ended up selling 60,000, according to Bentley. Imported copies of &quot;No Control&quot; to West Germany were repackaged with a limited edition bootleg 7&quot; of their debut self-titled EP (1981). By 1992, &quot;No Control&quot; had sold at least 80,000 copies, becoming the band&#x27;s fourth best-selling album at the time (their next album &quot;Against the Grain&quot; sold approximately 90,000 copies, while its follow-up &quot;Generator&quot; sold 85,000 and &#x27;Suffer&quot; sold 88,000).

The album has received generally favorable reviews in the years since its initial release, with several reviewers having deemed &quot;No Control&quot; one of Bad Religion&#x27;s best albums. AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus said that it &quot;simply and forcefully continued the shift, delivering a pummel of melodic songwriting made sharp by Greg Graffin&#x27;s populist cynicism and the stinging barbs of a twin-guitar strike...&quot;, and described the change as &quot;welcome, as it makes the band sound that much more direct on principal cuts.&quot; Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), found it to be polished to a &quot;fine gleam,&quot; sounding &quot;even tighter than &quot;Suffer&quot;, with even stronger songs.&quot;

In a May 2012 interview, Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge stated that his band&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;All or Nothing&quot; had inspired guitarist Brett Gurewitz to write &quot;another &quot;No Control&quot;&quot;. Rise Against cited the album as one of their 12 key influences, alongside works by Dead Kennedys, Fugazi and Jawbreaker.

On June 2, 2016, the song &quot;Change of Ideas&quot; was placed at No. 7 on &quot;Loudwire&quot;&#x27;s top ten list &quot;Greatest Songs Under One Minute Long&quot;.

== Track listing ==
== Release history ==
==Other uses==
* Track 3, &quot;No Control&quot; quotes Scottish natural historian James Hutton, &quot;no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.&quot;
* &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like&quot; was labeled as &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like... *?!%+!*&quot; on the disc to the original CD version.
* &quot;Billy&quot; was erroneously labeled as &quot;Bizzy&quot; on the cassette version.
* &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; was also labeled as &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Stop Without You&quot; on the disc to the original CD version. Also, in some software-based audio players and CD rippers that use CD lookup databases such as CDDB, &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; is tagged as &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Stop Without You&quot;.
* &quot;No Control&quot; (along with &quot;Suffer&quot;) is also mentioned in the song &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot; (from 1990&#x27;s &quot;Against the Grain&quot; and 1994&#x27;s &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;), when band&#x27;s guitarist Brett Gurewitz sings &quot;tried to tell you about no control, but now I really don&#x27;t know, and then you told me how bad you had to suffer, is that really all you have to offer&quot;.

<text>Kansas City Southern (KCS) was a transportation holding company with railroad investments in the United States, Mexico, and Panama and operated from 1887 to 2023. The KCS rail network included about of track in the U.S. and Mexico.
Its primary U.S. holding was the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), a Class I railroad that operated about in 10 states in the midwestern and southeastern United States. KCS&#x27;s hubs included Kansas City, Missouri; Shreveport, Louisiana; New Orleans; Dallas; and Houston. Among Class I railroads, KCS had the shortest route between Kansas City, the second-largest rail hub in the country, and the Gulf of Mexico. Its primary international holding was Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), which operated about in 15 states in northeastern, central, southeast-central and southwest-central Mexico. KCSM reached the Gulf of Mexico ports of Tampico, Altamira, and Veracruz, and the Pacific Ocean deepwater container port of Lázaro Cárdenas. KCS obtained 100% ownership of KCSM in 2005, making KCS the only U.S. Class I Railroad to own track in Mexico.

The company also owned half of the Panama Canal Railway Company (PCRC), which operates the Panama Canal Railway, providing ocean-to-ocean transshipment service between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The railroad served as an intermodal line for world commerce and complemented the Canal, the Colón Free Trade Zone, and the Pacific and Atlantic ports. As of 2009, PCRC&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary, Panarail Tourism, offered passenger service for business commuters, tourists, and private charters.

Beginning in 2021, KCS became the subject of a bidding war between Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway. Canadian Pacific (CP) emerged as the winner. CP then sought a merger, which was approved by the US Surface Transportation Board on March 15, 2023, and the combined &quot;Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited&quot; was created on April 14, 2023. The combined company forms the only railroad serving all of the countries in the North American trade zone (Canada, Mexico, and the United States).

== History ==

In 1887, Arthur Edward Stilwell and Edward L. Martin began construction on and incorporated the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway in suburban Kansas City, Missouri. Beginning operations in 1890, the railroad served the Argentine District in Kansas City, Kansas; Independence, Missouri; and the riverside commercial and industrial districts of Kansas City.

While the Belt Railway was a success, Stilwell had a much bigger dream. Over the ensuing decade, the line grew through construction and acquisition of other roads, such as the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway, to become a through route between Kansas City and Port Arthur, Texas. With the final spike being driven north of Beaumont, Texas, on September 11, 1897, the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company (KCP&amp;G) was completed. In 1900, KCP&amp;G became The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS). In 1939, KCS acquired the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway (L&amp;A), providing a route extending from Dallas to New Orleans, via Shreveport, Louisiana.

In 1962, KCS reorganized as a holding company, Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. (KCSI), as it began to diversify its interests into other industries under the CEO William Deramus III. The new KCSI focused primarily on the financial industry, along with the rail industry. In 1969, KCSI started the two largest companies that came out of the diversification: DST Systems and Janus Capital Group, which was known as Stilwell Financial at the time. DST Systems is a software development firm that specializes in information processing and management, with the goal of improving efficiency, productivity, and customer service. Janus Capital Group is a finance firm that provides growth and risk-managed investment strategies.

=== Expansion in the 1990s ===
The core KCSI rail system changed little until the 1990s, when the purchase of MidSouth Rail extended KCSI&#x27;s reach east from Shreveport into Mississippi and Alabama. Combined with existing KCSI routes, this created an east-west mainline marketed as the Meridian Speedway. Another acquisition, the Gateway Western Railway, extended KCS&#x27;s reach from Kansas City to St. Louis, Missouri, and Springfield, Illinois.

The 1990s also saw KCSI expand into Mexico with the acquisition of partial interests in the Texas Mexican Railway (TM) and Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM). TFM was created when KCSI and Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) purchased a government concession to operate a rail system in Mexico. The concession was also bid on by many other major companies, including the United States&#x27; largest railroad, Union Pacific Railroad. KCSI and TMM bid on, and won, the concession for $1.4 billion USD, paying 49% and 51%, respectively. TMM already partially owned the Texas Mexican Railway through a previous concession from the Mexican government. TM was particularly important to KCSI because they held the link from KCSI tracks to TFM tracks via trackage rights over the Union Pacific line.

Shortly after acquiring the Mexican government&#x27;s concession, KCSI entered into another joint venture to purchase a government concession. On June 19, 1998, the government of Panama turned over control of the Panama Canal Railway to Kansas City Southern Railroad and the privately held Lanigan Holdings, LLC. This created the Panama Canal Railway Company (PCRC).

After these large capital outputs, KCSI needed new money to improve the Mexican and Panamanian concessions they had purchased, and to continue to make capital expenditures in the future. To fund these efforts, KCSI spun off all assets that were not essential to the rail businesses. Doing this essentially paid off the purchase of their two existing concessions and freed up money to improve them. The first major improvement that took place was in 2000 and 2001 when the PCRC upgraded the railway to handle large, intermodal shipping containers, along with passenger transport.

In 2002, the Kansas City Southern Industries formally changed its name to Kansas City Southern (KCS) after spinning off many subsidiary businesses that were not directly related to the railroad business (the largest of which were Janus Capital Group and DST Systems). In 2005, Kansas City Southern purchased TMM&#x27;s share in TFM and TM, giving them full ownership of the companies. TFM was officially renamed Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. The Texas Mexican Railway retained its original name and is a subsidiary of KCS.

In June 2009, the Kansas City Southern began operating on new trackage between Victoria and Rosenberg, Texas, known as the Macaroni Line.

Patrick J. Ottensmeyer was named President in April 2015 and CEO in June 2016, succeeding David Starling. Ottensmeyer had served as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing and Chief Financial Officer. He was named Railroader of the Year by &quot;Railway Age&quot; for 2020.

In September 2020, the company rejected takeover offers from Global Infrastructure Partners that ranged up to $23 billion; the final offer valued the company at a 17% premium over its share high in February 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Merger with Canadian Pacific Railway ===
In March 2021, Calgary-based Canadian Pacific Railway offered over $25 billion to purchase KCS. The purchase would allow the Canadian company to create the first rail network connecting the United States, Mexico and Canada. However, in May 2021, Canadian National Railway announced a superior bid to CP&#x27;s, which KCS management later agreed to support. In August 2021, CP announced an increased bid that, while still less than CN&#x27;s bid, was claimed by CP to have a greater chance of regulatory approval. While KCS&#x27;s board agreed to CN&#x27;s bid, shareholder and regulatory approvals were still required; on August 31, the US Surface Transportation Board (STB) denied a voting trust between CN and KCS.

With the decision by the STB, KCS re-engaged with CP on CP&#x27;s original offer. On September 15, KCS confirmed that it had terminated its agreement with CN and would support CP&#x27;s revised offer. Kansas City Southern&#x27;s shareholders voted to approve the merger on December 10, 2021. The transaction closed in early 2022, following which KCS was held in a previously-approved voting trust pending approval by the STB; the combined company was to be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC). The combined &quot;Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited&quot; would form the first railroad serving all of the countries in the North American trade zone (Canada, Mexico and the United States).

On March 15, 2023, the STB approved the merger between the two companies, which was completed on April 14, 2023.

==Subsidiaries==

In addition to KCS, KCSM and PCRC, Kansas City Southern’s subsidiaries include:
* Gateway Eastern Railway Company (GWWE) is a wholly owned subsidiary of KCS. GWWE provides rail service over about of track in the East St. Louis, Illinois, area.
* Meridian Speedway, LLC (MSLLC) is a majority-owned, consolidated subsidiary that owns the former KCS rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is a portion of the KCS rail route between Dallas and Meridian, and is known as the &quot;Meridian Speedway.&quot; Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS), through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Alabama Great Southern Railroad, owns a minority interest in MSLLC.
* Southern Capital, Development, and Industrial Services Companies: The Southern Capital company consists of bulk storage facilities complete with ocean terminals (Pabtex) along with a tie and timber plant (Trans-Serve, Inc., also known as Superior Tie and Timber). The Southern Development Company is a holding company that owns various properties. The Southern Capital Corporation, LLC is a leasing company owned jointly by KCS and GATX Capital Corporation of San Francisco, California, Southern Capital Corporation has the rail assets that once belonged to Carland and KCS, as well as the loan portfolio once owned by Southern Leasing Corporation.
* The Texas Mexican Railway Company (TexMex) is wholly owned by KCS. TexMex consists of a railway that connects Corpus Christi, Texas to Laredo, Texas. TexMex also owns of Union Pacific trackage rights that spans from Beaumont, Texas to Robstown, Texas. With its trackage rights and physical railway, the Texas Mexican Railway connects KCSM and KCS at Laredo and Beaumont. TexMex also owns the Texas Mexican Railway International Bridge. It is the only rail bridge that connects the United States with Mexico through Laredo, and 40% of all rail traffic that travels to Mexico crosses over this bridge. Without TexMex, it would be nearly impossible for KCS and KCSM to act as a single company under Kansas City Southern.
* KCS also owns a handful of non-core businesses. These minor subsidiaries, holding companies or minority investments (investments in which KCS has less than 50 percent ownership), have few employees and serve to support the rail operation. These include Canama Transportation, Caymex Transportation, Inc., Rosenberg Regional LLC, Joplin Union Depot, Kansas City Terminal Railway, Port Arthur Bulk Marine Terminal Co. and Veals, Inc.

<text>The Australian Cattle Dog, or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either red or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; dog.

As with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury.

Thomas Simpson Hall, pastoralist and son of pioneer Hawkesbury region colonist George Hall, developed an Australian working dog for cattle farming during the mid 1800s. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the cattle dog (later, the Australian cattle dog), called Hall&#x27;s dogs &quot;Halls Heelers&quot;. Thomas Hall imported dogs from the United Kingdom, in particular blue-speckled Highland Collies, and crossed them with selected dingoes to create the breed.
The Halls Heelers were later developed, in particular by Jack and Harry Bagust from Sydney in the 1880s, into the two modern breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. The Bagust brothers &quot;bred a lot and drowned a lot&quot; to create the breed.

The Australian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a &quot;Red Heeler&quot; or &quot;Blue Heeler&quot; on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. The nickname &quot;Queensland Heeler&quot; may have originated in a popular booklet, published in Victoria.

==Characteristics==

===Appearance===

The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.

The Australian Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.

====Size====
The female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately at the withers, and the male measures about at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9.

====Coat and colour====

There are two accepted coat colours, red and blue. Chocolate and cream are considered to be faults. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with tan on the legs and chest and white markings and a black patch or &quot;mask&quot; on one or both sides of the head. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings and similarly to the blue dogs can have a brown (red) patch &quot;mask&quot; on one or both sides of the head and sometimes on the body.

Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs show from around four weeks of age as they grow and mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.

In addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs may have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white &quot;star&quot; on the forehead called the &quot;Bentley Mark&quot;, dog said to have been owned by an unsubstantiated Tom Bentley whose descendants allegedly could be identified by a white spot on the forehead and a black tail bar. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called &quot;creeping tan&quot;. The Australian Cattle Dog has a double coat—the short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog&#x27;s skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.
The mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, &quot;single&quot; (or &quot;half&quot;) mask and &quot;double&quot; (or &quot;full&quot;) mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.

====Tail====
The breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a good level of brush.

In the United States, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. Tail docking is illegal, except in special circumstances, in all states and territories of Australia.

The Australian Cattle Dog shares ancestry and early history with the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. A breed standard, current in Queensland during the 1930s, describes two varieties of Cattle Dog, &quot;long tail&quot; and &quot;short tail&quot;. The short tail variety was to be same as the long tail variety except for tail length. The two varieties were exhibited in separate classes. In 1963 the Australian National Kennel Council distinguished the two varieties in separate breed standards.

===Temperament===
Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.

When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful pet. However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal. By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog&#x27;s never being too far from the owner&#x27;s side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. It was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog&#x27;s protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.

While an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.

==As pets==

===Grooming===
Known as a &quot;wash and wear&quot; dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females).

===Training===
Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.

===Activities===
The Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.

Kennel club-sponsored herding trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as &quot;stay&quot;, &quot;get it&quot; and &quot;that&#x27;ll do&quot; are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.

The Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to drive reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.
Among the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler&#x27;s body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.

The Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed&#x27;s problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.

Australian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner&#x27;s side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner&#x27;s feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.

The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs, some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs, others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies, and some work as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.

==Health and lifespan==
===Lifespan===
In a 2024 UK study of 50 dogs the breed had an average life expectancy of 14 years compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.

===Common health problems===

The Australian Cattle Dog carries recessive piebald alleles that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 10.8% of Cattle Dogs in one Australian study were found to be deaf in either one or both ears.

The Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.

Hip dysplasia is not common in the breed, but it occurs sufficiently often for specialised pelvis radiographical screening tests to be offered to breeders and owners. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.

==History==

===In Australia===
British colonist George Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that cattle had to be moved along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. The mobs of cattle were small (the population centres were small) and the distances short relative to the long distance droving feats of the Duracks, and others, in the late nineteenth century.
Until the invention of ice-making and refrigeration in the 1850s (by a Scottish immigrant to Australia, James Harrison) butchers, and their customers, had no choice but to buy their meat in small quantities and the cattle growers, including the Halls, had no choice but to maintain a constant, but small, supply of cattle to their markets.

The droving dogs used at the time were commonly the Smithfield dogs which often barked at and bit the nose of the cattle which aggravated the livestock. A replacement was needed, and the Halls were prepared for this challenge. Thomas Simpson Hall, one of George&#x27;s sons, had established the Dartbrook station in the Upper Hunter Valley in the 1820s. He had taken with him dogs, as well as cattle, and had honed the cattle-handling potential in his dogs. He bred blue speckled Highland Collies with dingoes, an ancient type of dog which seldom barks and instinctively bites on the heel or hindquarters of the animals they chase down. The result was the creation of the first of the Halls Heelers which worked silently and bit the heels of the cattle to enforce authority. In the 1880s and 1890s, Jack and Harry Bagust of Sydney, crossed Halls Heelers with other breeds such as Kelpies and Dalmatians to produce the first dogs known as Australian Cattle Dogs.
By the 1890s, dogs of Halls Heeler ancestry had attracted the attention of a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs. Prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential.

Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote &quot;in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines&quot;. This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903. Kaleski&#x27;s standard emphasised that the dog should retain the overall general appearance of a &#x27;small thick-set dingo&#x27;.

Kaleski&#x27;s standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an insight into the early history of the breed. Most importantly, Kaleski identified Thomas Simpson Hall&#x27;s association with the Halls Heeler.

In the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivation were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne. These were a different population from those shown in New South Wales and included both long-tailed and short-tailed exhibits. These dogs may have come from Hall properties in Queensland. Byrne, however, initiated a trend that favoured Cattle Dogs bred in New South Wales and, during the 1920s, many breeders followed this trend.

Significant early progenitor dogs of the Cattle Dog pedigree include &quot;Brooklyn Dandy&quot;, &quot;Blue Rock&quot;, &quot;Little Gem&quot;, &quot;Little Sally&quot;, &quot;Little Logic&quot; and &quot;Logic Return&quot;.

The prominence of &quot;Little Logic&quot; and &quot;Logic Return&quot; in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding dogs, such as &quot;Wooleston Blue Jack&quot;, to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe.

===In the United States===
In the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a Napa, California cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during World War II, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his &quot;improved&quot; dogs to the United States. Many U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.

In the late 1950s a veterinarian in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher&#x27;s dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in &quot;Western Horsemen&quot; stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including &quot;Oaklea Blue Ace&quot;, &quot;Glen Iris Boomerang&quot; and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.

Australian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed. In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an &quot;American Cattle Dog&quot;, and all others would still be registered as &quot;Australian Cattle Dogs&quot;.

===In Canada===
The breed gained official recognition from the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, &quot;Landmaster Carina&quot; was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.

===In the United Kingdom===
The first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, &quot;Lenthel Flinton&quot; and &quot;Lenthel Darlot&quot;, imported in 1980 by Malcolm Duding. They were followed soon afterwards by &quot;Landmaster Darling Red&quot; in whelp. &quot;Landmaster Darling Red&quot; was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding artificial insemination, the UK gene pool was limited. In 1985 the Australian Cattle Dog Society of Great Britain was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category &quot;Any Variety Not Separately Classified&quot;. Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.

<text>The Mediterranean [[Expeditionary warfare|Expeditionary Force]] (MEF) was the part of the British Army during World War I that commanded all Allied forces at Gallipoli and Salonika. It was formed in March 1915, under the command of General Sir Ian Hamilton, at the beginning of the Gallipoli campaign of the First World War.

== History ==
The Mediterranean Expeditionary Force included the initial naval operation to force the straits of the Dardanelles. Its headquarters was formed in March 1915. The MEF was originally commanded by General Sir Ian Hamilton until he was dismissed due to the failure of the 29th Division at Gallipoli. Command briefly passed to Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, but for the duration of the Gallipoli campaign it was General Sir Charles Monro, who had served on the Western Front as a division, corps, and army commander, who led the MEF.

While the Gallipoli theatre was the only active Mediterranean theatre, the MEF was used to refer to the forces at Gallipoli. With the opening of the Salonika front in October 1915, the forces at Gallipoli were referred to as the Dardanelles Army and the Salonika contingent became the Salonika Army on the Macedonian front. Once Salonika became the sole Mediterranean theatre the MEF was commanded by General Sir Archibald Murray who was based in Egypt and whose command also involved defence of the Suez Canal from Turkish attacks. As the importance of the Sinai front grew, a separate headquarters called the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was formed (in March 1916).

Supposedly when Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener, was preparing the Mediterranean expedition he intended to name the headquarters the Constantinople Expeditionary Force but Hamilton suggested this might be a bit of a giveaway and also noted in his diary, &quot;I begged him to alter this to avert Fate&#x27;s evil eye.&quot;

<doc id="445363" wikidata="Q1073644" url="?curid=445363" title="Chinatown, San Francisco">
<text>The Chinatown centered on Grant Avenue and Stockton Street in San Francisco, California, () is the oldest Chinatown in North America and one of the largest Chinese enclaves outside Asia. It is also the oldest and largest of the four notable Chinese enclaves within San Francisco. Since its establishment in the early 1850s, it has been important and influential in the history and culture of ethnic Chinese immigrants in North America. Chinatown is an enclave that has retained its own customs, languages, places of worship, social clubs, and identity. 

The Chinatown district is primarily Cantonese and Taishanese-speaking, both dialects originating in southern China. Most Chinatown residents have origins in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong; albeit there are some Mandarin-speaking residents from Taiwan and central and Northern China, but lesser in comparison to Cantonese-speaking people, despite Cantonese being a minority language amongst people in China and ethnically Chinese people in Asia.

There are two hospitals, several parks and squares, numerous churches, a post office, and other infrastructure. Recent immigrants, many of whom are elderly, opt to live in Chinatown because of the availability of affordable housing and their familiarity with the culture. Due to a combination of factors, some more broad-based related to difficult circumstances for San Francisco itself, while other factors are more specific to this neighborhood, San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown faces a struggle for survival.

==Geography and location==

Officially, Chinatown is located in downtown San Francisco, covers 24 square blocks, and overlaps five postal ZIP codes (94108, 94133, 94111, 94102, and 94109). It is within an area of roughly long (north to south) by wide (east to west) with the current boundaries being, approximately, Kearny Street in the east, Broadway in the north, Powell in the west, and Bush Street in the south. Owing to a combination of multifactorial issues, some more generally tied to socioeconomic difficulties afflicting downtown San Francisco itself, while other factors are more specific to this neighborhood, San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown faces a struggle for survival and is shrinking.

Within Chinatown there are two major north–south thoroughfares. One is Grant Avenue, with the Dragon Gate (&quot;Chinatown Gate&quot; on some maps) at the intersection of Bush Street and Grant Avenue, designed by landscape architects Melvin Lee and Joseph Yee and architect Clayton Lee; Saint Mary&#x27;s Square with a statue of Sun Yat-sen by Benjamin Bufano; a war memorial to Chinese war veterans; and stores, restaurants and mini-malls that cater mainly to tourists. The other, Stockton Street, is frequented less often by tourists, and it presents an authentic Chinese look and feel reminiscent of Hong Kong, with its produce and fish markets, stores, and restaurants. It is dominated by mixed-use buildings that are three to four stories high, with shops on the ground floor and residential apartments upstairs.

A major focal point in Chinatown is Portsmouth Square. Since it is one of the few open spaces in Chinatown and sits above a large underground parking lot, Portsmouth Square is used by people such as tai chi practitioners and old men playing Chinese chess. A replica of the Goddess of Democracy used in the Tiananmen Square protest was built in 1999 by Thomas Marsh and stands in the square. It is made of bronze and weighs approximately .

==Demographics==
According to the San Francisco Planning Department, Chinatown is &quot;the most densely populated urban area west of Manhattan&quot;, with 15,000 residents living in 20 square blocks. In the 1970s, the population density in Chinatown was seven times the San Francisco average.

During the time from 2009 to 2013, the median household income was $20,000 – compared to $76,000 citywide – with 29% of residents below the national poverty threshold. The median age was 50 years, the oldest of any neighborhood. As of 2015, two thirds of the residents lived in one of Chinatown&#x27;s 105 single room occupancy hotels (SRO), 96 of which had private owners and nine were owned by nonprofits. There are two public housing projects in Chinatown, Ping Yuen and North Ping Yuen.

Most residents are monolingual speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties of the Chinese language: historically Hoisanese, now Cantonese and some Mandarin. In 2015, only 14% of households in the SROs were headed by a person that spoke English fluently. The areas of Stockton and Washington Streets and Jackson and Kearny Streets in Chinatown are almost entirely Chinese or Asian, with blocks ranging from 93% to 100% Asian. According to a study by the San Francisco Planning Department in 2018, 81% of the residents in the neighborhood were Asian.

Many of the Chinese immigrants who managed to accumulate wealth while living in Chinatown move to the Richmond District, the Sunset District, or the suburbs.

===Demographic history===
In the 1850s, Chinese pioneers, mainly from villages in the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, began immigrating in large numbers to San Francisco, initially drawn by the California Gold Rush and the building of the first transcontinental railroad, and settling in Chinatown for refuge from the hostilities in the West. The main dialect spoken in Chinatown then was Hoisan-wa (aka Hoisanese; Toisanese in Cantonese and Taishanese in Mandarin), native to the emigrants from Hoisan (aka Toisan in Cantonese and Taishan in Mandarin), Sze Yup, in the Pearl River Delta. Surviving the ravages of the 1880s, Chinatown became a haven for later waves of emigrants from China in the 20th century. 

Working-class Hongkonger emigrants began arriving in large numbers in the late 1960s. Despite their status and professional qualifications in Hong Kong, many took low-paying employment in restaurants and garment factories in Chinatown because of limited English. An increase in Cantonese-speaking emigrants from Hong Kong and Mainland China has gradually led to the replacement in Chinatown of the Hoisanese dialect by the standard Cantonese dialect.

Due to such overcrowding and poverty, other Chinese areas have been established within the city of San Francisco proper, including one in its Richmond and three more in its Sunset districts, as well as a recently established one in the Visitacion Valley neighborhood. These outer neighborhoods have been settled largely by Chinese from Southeast Asia. There are also many suburban Chinese communities in the San Francisco Bay Area, especially in Silicon Valley, such as Cupertino, Fremont, and Milpitas, where many Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese Americans settled. Despite these developments, many continue to commute in from these outer neighborhoods and cities to shop in Chinatown, causing gridlock on roads and delays in public transit, especially on weekends. To address this problem, the local public transit agency, Muni extended the city&#x27;s subway network to the neighborhood via the new Central Subway.

Unlike in most Chinatowns in the United States, ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam have not established businesses in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown district, due to high property values and rents. Instead, many Chinese-Vietnamese – as opposed to ethnic Vietnamese who tended to congregate in larger numbers in San Jose – have established a separate Vietnamese enclave on Larkin Street in the heavily working-class Tenderloin district of San Francisco, where it is now known as the city&#x27;s &quot;Little Saigon&quot;.

==History==
===Origins: 1850s===
====Guangdong pioneers====
San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown was the port of entry for early Chinese immigrants from the west side of the Pearl River Delta, speaking mainly Hoisanese and Zhongshanese, in the Guangdong province of southern China from the 1850s to the 1900s. On August 28, 1850, at Portsmouth Square, San Francisco&#x27;s first mayor, John Geary, officially welcomed 300 &quot;China Boys&quot; to San Francisco. By 1854, the Alta California, a local newspaper which had previously taken a supportive stance on Chinese immigrants in San Francisco, began attacking them, writing after a recent influx that &quot;if the city continues to fill up with these people, it will be ere long become necessary to make them subject of special legislation&quot;.
These early immigrants settled near Portsmouth Square and around Dupont Street (now called Grant Ave). As the settlement grew in the early 1850s, Chinese shops opened on Sacramento St, which the Guangdong pioneers called &quot;Tang people street&quot; (); and the settlement became known as &quot;Tang people town&quot; (), which in Cantonese is &quot;Tong Yun Fow&quot;. By the 1870s, the economic center of Chinatown moved from Sacramento St to Dupont St; e.g., in 1878, out of 423 Chinese firms in Chinatown, 121 were located on Dupont St, 60 on Sacramento St, 60 on Jackson St, and the remainder elsewhere.

The area was the one geographical region deeded by the city government and private property owners which allowed Chinese persons to inherit and inhabit dwellings within the city. The majority of these Chinese shopkeepers, restaurant owners, and hired workers in San Francisco Chinatown were predominantly Hoisanese and male. For example, in 1851, the reported Chinese population in California was about 12,000 men and fewer than ten women. Some of the early immigrants worked as mine workers or independent prospectors hoping to strike it rich during the 1849 Gold Rush. Many Chinese found jobs working for large companies seeking a source of labor, most famously as part of the Central Pacific on the Transcontinental Railroad, from 1865 to 1869.

====Associations and institutions====
The west side of the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong, where most of the Chinese emigrated from, was subdivided into many distinct districts and some with distinct dialects. Several district associations in San Francisco, open to anyone emigrating from those districts in Guangdong, were formed in the 1850s to act as a culture-shock absorber for newly arrived immigrants and to settle disputes among their members. Although there are some disagreements about which association formed first, by 1854, six such district associations were formed, of various size and influence, and disputes between members of different associations became more frequent. Thus, in 1862, the six district associations (commonly called the Chinese Six Companies, even though the number of member associations varied through the years) banded together to resolve inter-district disputes. This was made formal in 1882 and incorporated in 1901 as the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (on Stockton Street) to look after the general interest of the Chinese people living in a hostile western world.

Founded purportedly in roughly 1852 or 1853, the Tin How Temple (Queen of Heaven and Goddess of the Seven Seas) on Waverly Place is the oldest Chinese temple in the United States. It is dedicated to the goddess Tin How or Mazu, the Divine Protector of seafarers, much honored by Chinese immigrants, especially arriving by ship, to San Francisco. The original building was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, and it opened on the top floor of a four-story building at 125 Waverly Place in 1910.

After closing in 1955, the temple reopened in 1975, due to a resurgence of interest from a new immigrant population following the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Another Mazu temple, known as Ma-Tsu Temple was established in 1986 by Taiwanese American community and affiliated to Chaotian Temple in Taiwan.

The Chinese Presbyterian Church on Stockton Street can trace its roots to October 1852, when Cantonese-speaking Rev. William Speer, a missionary in Canton, came to work with the Chinese immigrants in San Francisco. In November 1853 he organized the first Chinese mission in the United States, which provided much needed medical aid and conducted day and night schools that taught English to Chinese immigrants. He also published a Chinese/English newspaper, &quot;the Oriental&quot;, which staunchly defended the Chinese as anti-Chinese sentiment began to grow in the 1850s. The original building was destroyed by the earthquake, and the present church building on 925 Stockton Street was built in 1907.

Other Christian denominations followed, including the Methodist Church on Washington Street (founded 1870, rebuilt 1911) and the First Baptist Church (founded 1880, rebuilt 1908 on Waverly Place) as well as Catholic, Congregational, and Episcopal. The pattern these early missions followed was to first conduct English language classes and Sunday schools. In these decades, the only English classes available to Chinese immigrants were those offered by these Christian missions. Some added rescue homes (e.g., from prostitution), and social services for the sick and protection from racial discrimination. With such tactics, the early Christian missions and churches in Chinatown gained widespread respect and new converts.

====Prostitution and ill repute====
In the 1850s, San Francisco &quot;was all but submerged in Caucasian forms of gambling and prostitution and lewdness&quot;. During the late period of the California Gold Rush, a few Chinese female prostitutes began their sexual businesses in Chinatown. In addition, the major prostitution enterprises had been raised by criminal gang group &quot;Tong&quot;, importing unmarried Chinese women to San Francisco. During the 1870s to 1880s, the population of Chinese sex workers in Chinatown grew rapidly to more than 1,800, accounting for 70% of the total Chinese female population.

In the mid-19th century, police harassment reshaped the urban geography and the social life of Chinese prostitutes. Consequently, hundreds of Chinese prostitutes were expelled to side streets and alleys hidden from public traffic. From 1870 to 1874, the California legislature formally criminalized the immigrant Asian women who were transported into California. In 1875, the U.S. Congress followed California&#x27;s action and passed the Page Law, which was the first major legal restriction to prohibit the immigration of Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolian women into America. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act declared that no more skilled or unskilled immigrants would be allowed to enter the country, which meant that many Chinese and Chinese Americans could not have families in America, because their wives and children were prohibited to immigrate. Simultaneously, the public discourse began to accuse Chinese prostitutes of transmitting venereal diseases. Dr. Hugh Huger Toland, a member of the San Francisco Board of Health, reported that white boys and men contracted diseases when they visited &quot;Chinese houses of prostitution&quot; in Chinatown, in order to warn white citizens to stay away; Toland asserted that nine-tenths of his patients had patronized Chinese prostitutes. &quot;When these persons come to me I ask them where they got the disease, and they generally tell me that they have been with Chinawomen.&quot; 
====Emergence of tourism====
By the end of the 19th century, Chinatown&#x27;s assumed reputation as a place of vice caused it to become a tourist destination, attracting numerous working-class white people, who sought the oriental mystery of Chinese culture and sought to fulfill their expectations and fantasies about the filth and depravity. The white customers&#x27; patronization of Chinatown prostitutes was more extensive than gambling. After catering for three decades to white people as well as Chinese bachelors, Chinatown&#x27;s prostitution sector developed into a powerful vested interest, favoring the vice industry. As the tourist industry grew up, the visitors came to include members of the white middle class, which pushed the vice businesses to transform into an entertainment industry as a more respectable form in which to serve white customers.

After the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, San Francisco saw the birth of its tourism industry. By the 1870s and further established in the 1880s and 1890s, Chinatown&#x27;s exotic, infamous reputation began to attract tourists. Tour providers emphasized the vice-ridden elements of the area, strongly encouraging any curious visitors to take a professional guide or police escort with them to venture into Chinatown. These early tours often included staged reenactments of the &quot;depravity of the locals&quot; who were paid by tour operators to participate in the reenactments. Such reenactments exacerbated the perceptions of Chinatown as a problematic, vice-ridden location among San Francisco visitors and San Franciscans. The emphasis on the danger and depravity of the community ignored deeper issues of poverty, racial discrimination, and problems of overcrowding with overtaxed infrastructure.

====Ah Toy====

Ah Toy (18 May 1829 – 1 February 1928) was a Cantonese prostitute and madam in San Francisco during the California Gold Rush, and purportedly the first Chinese prostitute in San Francisco. Arriving from Hong Kong in 1848, she became the best-known Asian woman in the American frontier. When Ah Toy left China for the United States, she originally traveled with her husband, who died during the voyage. Toy became the mistress of the ship&#x27;s captain, who showered gold upon her, so much so that by the time she arrived in San Francisco in the 1840s, Toy had a fair bit of money. Noticing the looks she drew from the men in her new town, she figured they would pay for a closer look. Her peep shows became quite successful, and she eventually became a high-priced prostitute. In 1850, Toy opened a chain of brothels at 34 and 36 Waverly Place (then called Pike Street), importing girls from China in their teens, 20s and 30s, as well as some as young as eleven years old, to work in them. Her neighbors on Pike Street—conveniently linked to San Francisco&#x27;s business district by Commercial Street—included the elegant new &quot;parlour house&quot; of madame Belle Cora, and the cottage of Fanny Perrier, mistress of Judge Edward (Ned) McGowan. In 1857, Ah Toy returned to China a wealthy woman to live the rest of her days in comfort, but came back to California in 1859. From 1868 until her death in 1928, she lived a largely quiet life in Santa Clara County, returning to public attention only upon dying at age 98 in San Jose, three months short of her ninety ninth birthday.

===1870s to the 1906 earthquake===

Relations between the United States and Qing China were normalized through the Burlingame Treaty of 1868. Among other terms, the treaty promised the right of free immigration and travel within the United States for Chinese. Business leaders saw China as a plentiful source of cheap labor, and celebrated the treaty&#x27;s ratification. But this did not last for long.

The mostly male Chinese immigrants came to the United States with the intent of sending money home to support their families; coupled with the high cost of repaying their loans for travel, they often had to take any work that was available. Fears began to arise among non-Chinese workers that they could be replaced, and resentment towards Chinese immigrants rose. With extensive nationwide unemployment in the wake of the Panic of 1873, racial tensions in the city boiled over into full blown race riots. The two-day San Francisco riot of 1877 raged through Chinatown in July; four were killed and in property damage was done to Chinese-owned businesses. In response to the violence, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, also known as the Chinese Six Companies, which evolved out of the labor recruiting organizations for different areas of Guangdong, was created to provide the community with a unified voice. The heads of these companies advocated for the Chinese community to the wider business community as a whole and to the city government.

The state legislature of California passed several measures to restrict the rights of Chinese immigrants, but these were largely superseded by the terms of the Burlingame Treaty of 1868.

====Chinese Exclusion Act====
In 1880, the Burlingame Treaty was renegotiated and the United States ratified the Angell Treaty, which allowed federal restrictions on Chinese immigration and temporarily suspended the immigration of unskilled laborers. Anti-immigrant sentiment became federal law once the United States Government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882: the first immigration restriction law aimed at a single ethnic group. This law, along with other immigration restriction laws such as the Geary Act, greatly reduced the numbers of Chinese allowed into the country and the city, and in theory limited Chinese immigration to single males only. Exceptions were in fact granted to the wives and minor children of wealthy merchants; immigrants would purchase or partner in businesses to declare themselves merchants in order to bring their families to America. Alternatively, prospective immigrants could become &quot;paper sons&quot; by purchasing the identity of Americans whose citizenship had been established by birthright. However, the Exclusion Act was credited with reducing the population of the neighborhood to an all-time low in the 1920s.
Many early Chinese immigrants to San Francisco and beyond were processed at Angel Island, in the San Francisco Bay, which is now a state park. Unlike Ellis Island on the east coast where prospective European immigrants might be held for up to a week, Angel Island typically detained Chinese immigrants for months while they were interrogated closely to validate their papers. The detention facility was renovated in 2005 and 2006 under a federal grant.

====Tong wars====
As in much of San Francisco, a period of criminality existed during the late 19th century; many tongs arose, trafficking in smuggling, gambling, and prostitution. From the mid-1870s, turf battles sprang up over competing criminal enterprises. By the early 1880s, the term tong war was being popularly used to describe these periods of violence in Chinatown. At their height in the 1880s and 1890s, twenty to thirty tongs ran highly profitable gambling houses, brothels, opium dens, and slave trade enterprises in Chinatown. Overcrowding, segregation, graft, and the lack of governmental control contributed to conditions that sustained the criminal tongs until the early 1920s.

Chinatown&#x27;s isolation and compact geography intensified the criminal behavior that terrorized the community for decades despite efforts by the Six Companies and police/city officials to stem the tide. The San Francisco Police Department established its so-called Chinatown Squad in the 1880s, consisting of six patrolmen led by a sergeant. However, the Squad was ineffective largely by design. An investigation published in 1901 by the California state legislature found that Mayor James D. Phelan and Police Chief William P. Sullivan Jr. had knowingly tolerated gambling and prostitution in Chinatown in the interest of bolstering municipal revenue, calling the police department &quot;so apathetic in putting down the horrible system of slavery existing in Chinatown as to justify your committee in believing it criminally negligent.&quot; Phelan and Sullivan testified it would take between 180 and 400 policemen to enforce the laws against gambling and prostitution, which was contradicted by the ex-Chief of Police William J. Biggy, who said 30 &quot;earnestly directed&quot; policemen would suffice.

====Bubonic plague====
In March 1900, a Chinese-born man who was a long-time resident of Chinatown was found dead of bubonic plague. The next morning, all of Chinatown was quarantined, with policemen preventing &quot;Asiatics&quot; (people of Asian heritage) from either entering or leaving. The San Francisco Board of Health began looking for more cases of plague and began burning personal property and sanitizing buildings, streets and sewers within Chinatown. Chinese Americans protested and the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association threatened lawsuits.

The quarantine was lifted but the burning and fumigating continued. A federal court ruled that public health officials could not close off Chinatown without any proof that Chinese Americans were anymore susceptible to plague than Anglo Americans.

===1906 to the 1960s===
The Chinatown neighborhood was completely destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire that leveled most of the city. &quot;The fire had full sway, and Chinatown, for the removal of which many a scheme has been devised, is but a memory.&quot; Oakland Tribune, April 1906.

====Relocation attempt====
Plans to relocate Chinatown predated the earthquake several years. At the 1901 Chinese Exclusion Convention held in San Francisco, A. Sbarboro called Chinatown &quot;synonymous with disease, dirt and unlawful deeds&quot; that &quot;give[s] us nothing but evil habits and noxious stenches&quot;.

With Chinatown completely demolished by the Great Fire, which ended on April 21, 1906, the City seized the chance to remove the Chinese from the old downtown business district. Certain city officials and real-estate developers made more formal plans to move Chinatown to the Hunters Point neighborhood at the southern edge of the city, or even further south to Daly City. Abe Ruef, the political boss widely considered to be the power behind Mayor Eugene Schmitz, invited himself to become part of the Committee of Fifty and, within a week of the end of the Great Fire, on Saturday, April 27, 1906, formed an additional Subcommittee on Relocating the Chinese, because he felt the land was too valuable for Chinese.

Opposition arose, however, from politicians who feared that the removal of the Chinese would affect San Francisco&#x27;s lucrative trade with Asian countries. Moreover, the government of China was also opposed, and soon after the earthquake, Tsi Chi Chow, the first secretary of the Chinese legation in Washington, DC, arrived in San Francisco, conveying to California governor George Pardee the opposition of China&#x27;s Empress Dowager Cixi to the plan. The representatives, &quot;acting unofficially&quot;, stated &quot;the only way to remove the Chinese from the old Chinatown would be to give them a place elsewhere that would be acceptable for their purpose, when they might be willing to move.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; reported it as &quot;a vigorous protest&quot; and noted that as the site of the Chinese consulate was the property of Imperial China, it could not be reassigned by the city.

On May 10, 1906, the subcommittee met with representatives from the Chinese community, the Chinese Six Companies, who said that they would either rebuild in their old Chinatown quarters or move across the bay to Oakland, where most of the Chinatown refugees had fled. Other community leaders pointed out that displaced residents may not stop to resettle in Hunters Point, moving further to other West Coast cities like Seattle or Los Angeles, taking the pool of cheap labor with them. On July 8, 1906, after 25 committee meetings and considering various alternative sites in the city, the subcommittee submitted a final report stating their inability to drive the Chinese from their old Chinatown quarters. Ironically, plans to relocate Chinatown failed in the end because restrictive housing covenants in other areas of the city prohibited Chinese from settling elsewhere. In any event, the ability to rebuild in their old Chinatown quarters was the first significant victory for the Chinese community in Chinatown.

====Rebuilding====

Even when the Subcommittee was bringing its relocation attempt to an end, the Chinese were already rebuilding, albeit with temporary wooden buildings which did not require permits. By June 10, 1906, twelve Chinese businesses were opened in Chinatown, including a couple of cafes. The actual reconstruction did not begin until October 1, 1906, when the City granted 43 building permits to Chinese businesses. By the time of the first post-quake Chinese New Year in 1907, several dozen buildings were completed, using old bricks unburnt by the fire, and Chinatown was filled with happy people. The reconstruction of Chinatown was completed more or less in 1908, a year ahead of the rest of the city.

While the city&#x27;s proposals to relocate Chinatown failed, the directive of rebuilding Chinatown into an attractive district along orientalized and stereotyped conceptions still gained traction. A group of Chinese merchants, including Mendocino-born Look Tin Eli, hired American architects to design in a Chinese-motif &quot;Oriental&quot; style in order to promote tourism in the rebuilt Chinatown. The results of this design strategy were the pagoda-topped buildings of the Sing Chong and Sing Fat bazaars on the west corners of Grant Ave (then Dupont St) and California St, which have become icons of San Francisco Chinatown.

This design strategy leveraged the ethnic identity and exoticness that city planners used to justify the relocation of Chinatown to become the same forces that made the area an attractive tourist location. In constructing &quot;Oriental&quot; style architecture, the area gratified Western fascination with and perception of a stereotyped Chinese identity. Opportunistic individuals from within the Chinese community and from outside the Chinese community made entrepreneurial gains from this &quot;ethnic tourism&quot; as it emerged in the early 1900s and boosted local business.

In November 1907, an article extolling the virtues of the &quot;new Chinatown of San Francisco&quot; was written, praising the new &quot;substantial, modern, fireproof buildings of brick and stone ... following the Oriental style of architecture&quot; and declaring &quot;[n]o more picturesque squalor, no more gambling dens, opium joints or public haunts of vice&quot; would be tolerated, at the command of the Chinese Six Companies. By then, 5,000 residents had returned, of the estimated 30,000 that lived in Chinatown prior to the quake.

When the earthquake destroyed Chinatown&#x27;s wooden tenements, it also dealt a blow to the tongs. Criminal tongs continued on until the 1920s, when legitimate Chinese merchants and a more capable Chinatown Squad under Sgt. Jack Manion gained the upper hand. Manion was appointed leader of the Squad in 1921 and served for two decades. Stiffer legislation against prostitution and drugs ended the tongs. The Chinatown Squad was finally disbanded in August 1955 by Police Chief George Healey, upon the request of the influential &quot;Chinese World&quot; newspaper, which had editorialized the Squad was an &quot;affront to Americans of Chinese descent&quot;.

The rhetoric of a &quot;New Chinatown&quot; obscured the reality of the community&#x27;s perpetuating problems, particularly those of poverty, overcrowding, and racial discrimination. While the Chinese merchants succeeded in rebuilding in a tourist-attractive way, they could not influence the landlords, most of which were not Chinese, to provide adequate housing for the Chinese residents. In a 1930 Community Chest Survey of 153 Chinatown families, 32 families, with an average of five persons each, lived in one room each; only 19 families had complete bath tub, kitchen, and toilet facilities; on the average, there was one kitchen for 3.1 families and one toilet for 4.6 families (or 28.3 persons). Crowded inadequate living conditions contributed to a high death rate for the Chinese. The Chinese were no longer a problem for the city; they were forgotten.

By 1947, Chinatown established itself as a central tourist destination and a rapidly developing community. Tension began to arise between businesses in Chinatown seeking to modernize and city planning committees seeking to maintain the &quot;Oriental&quot; look of the area. Similar to the post-earthquake discussion, Chinatown remained a contested space for conflicting visions of the area&#x27;s development. In 1947, the Board of Supervisors proposed a building code prohibiting architectural changes to the area. Opposition to these preservationist initiatives came from Chinese business owners and some of the architects who designed the buildings, among others. These individuals saw such building codes or architectural regulations as hindering the progress of the community and treating it as a static ethnic icon.

====Nightlife====

The famous Sam Wo restaurant opened in 1912.

In 1925 for the celebration of the San Francisco Diamond Jubilee, the Downtown Merchants Association, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and the San Francisco Diamond Jubilee Festival jointly raised $18,000 for 43 dragon street lamps to be cast in China and installed along Grant Avenue from Bush Street to Broadway. Designed by W(alter) D’Arcy Ryan, who also designed the &quot;Path of Gold&quot; streetlights along Market Street, the distinctive street lamp, painted in traditional Chinese colors of red, gold and green, was composed of a cast-iron hexagonal base supporting a lotus and bamboo shaft surmounted with two cast-aluminum dragons below a pagoda lantern with bells and topped by a stylized hexagonal red roof—all in keeping with the Oriental style pioneered by Look Tin Eli (1910). The new lamps made Grant Avenue one of the brightest streets in the City at night, at a cost of each. Since then, the original molds were used to add 24 more dragon street lamps were in 1996 (distinguishable by the foundry, whose name and location in Emporia, Kansas is cast on an access door at the base), and later, 23 more were added along Pacific by PG&amp;E.
During the Great Depression, many nightclubs and cocktail bars were started in Chinatown. The Forbidden City nightclub, located at 369 Sutter Street just outside Chinatown and run by Charlie Low, became one of the most famous entertainment places in San Francisco. While it was doing business, from the late 1930s to the late 1950s, the Forbidden City gained an international reputation with its unique showcase of exotic oriental performance from Chinese American performers. Another popular club for tourists and LGBT clients was Li Po, which, like Forbidden City, combined western entertainment with &quot;Oriental&quot; culture. It was advertised in a 1939 tourism guide book as a &quot;jovial and informal Chinatown cocktail lounge&quot; where one could find &quot;love, passion, and nighttime&quot;.[16] As of 2018, it was still in operation at 916 Grant Avenue.

====The Second World War years and immigration reform====
For the Chinese in Chinatown, the war came upon them in September 1931, when Japan attacked the Manchurian city of Mukden, and became impossible to ignore in July 1937, when Japan launched a major offensive southward from their base in Manchuria towards the heart of China. In response, the Chinese Six Companies convened many community organizations together, from which was founded the Chinese War Relief Association, to raise funds from the Chinatown communities throughout the U.S. to aid civilians trapped by the war in China. In San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, a popular means to raise money for war relief was through the Rice Bowl parades and parties, where the appeal to fill the rice bowls of starving children victimized by the war in China resonated with the Chinatown community. One hallmark of the Rice Bowl parade was the striking scene of a large number of Chinese-American women in fashionable Chinese dress (the cheongsam) carrying one huge Chinese flag spanning the width of the street, onto which money was thrown from balconies, windows, and sidewalks. In the Rice Bowl parade and party of 1938, San Francisco Chinatown raised $55,000; the second Rice Bowl in 1940 collected $87,000; and the third in 1941 brought in $93,000—all for war and hunger relief of civilians in war-torn China. 
Once China became an ally to the U.S. in World War II, a positive image of the Chinese began to emerge. In October 1942, Earl Warren, running for Governor of California, wrote, &quot;Like all native born Californians, I have cherished during my entire life a warm and cordial feeling for the Chinese people.&quot;
 In her goodwill tour of the U.S. starting in February 1943, Madame Chiang Kai Shek probably did more to change the American attitude towards the Chinese people than any other single person. She was hosted by the First Lady and President Franklin D. Roosevelt; she was the second woman and the first Chinese to address the U.S. Congress. The American public embraced her with respect and kindness, which is in stark contrast to the treatment of most Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans. To the Chinese in Chinatown, she became an icon of the war years.

In December 1943, in recognition of the important role of China as an ally in the war, the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the Magnuson Act, which allowed for naturalization but restricted Chinese immigrants to a small annual quota of 105 new entry visas. The repeal of the Exclusion Act and other immigration restriction laws, in conjunction with passage of the War Brides Act in December 1945, allowed Chinese-American veterans to bring their families outside of national quotas and led to a major population boom in the area during the 1950s. However, tight quotas on new immigration from China still applied until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed.

In the 1948 landmark case of Shelley v. Kraemer, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled without dissent that enforcing racially restrictive covenants in property deeds violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus such covenants are unenforceable in court, which lifted the invisible walls around Chinatown, permitting some Chinese Americans to move out of the &quot;Gilded Ghetto&quot; into other neighborhoods of the city and gain a foothold on the middle class. Twenty years later, such racially restrictive covenants were outlawed in the 1968 Fair Housing Act.

====Frank Wong dioramas====
San Francisco artist Frank Wong created miniature dioramas that depict Chinatown during the 1930s and 1940s. In 2004, Wong donated seven miniatures of scenes of Chinatown, titled &quot;The Chinatown Miniatures Collection,&quot; to the Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA). The dioramas are on permanent display in CHSA&#x27;s Main Gallery.

===1960s–present===
In the 1960s, the shifting of under-utilized national immigration quotas brought in another huge wave of immigrants, mostly from Hong Kong. This changed San Francisco Chinatown from predominantly Hlay Yip Wah (Sze Yup or Hoisan Wah)-speaking to Sam Yup Wah (standard Cantonese)-speaking. During the same decade, many stores moved from Grant Avenue to Stockton Street, drawn by lower rents and the better transportation enabled by the 30-Stockton Muni trolleybus line.
There were areas where many Chinese in Northern California living outside of San Francisco Chinatown could maintain small communities or individual businesses. Nonetheless, the historic rights of property owners to deed or sell their property to whomever they pleased was exercised enough to keep the Chinese community from spreading. However, in 1948, &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, the Supreme Court had ruled that racially restrictive covenants in deeds are unenforceable in courts due to the 14th amendment equal protection clause; and in 1968 the Fair Housing Act outlawed racially restrictive covenants. This ruling and law allowed the enlargement of Chinatown and an increase in the Chinese population of the city. At the same time, the declining white population of the city as a result of White Flight combined to change the demographics of the city. Neighborhoods that were once predominately white, such as Richmond District and Sunset District and in other suburbs across the San Francisco Bay Area became centers of new Chinese immigrant communities.

Until 1979, the United States recognized the Republic of China in Taiwan as the sole legitimate government of all of China, and emigration from Taiwan was counted under the same grouping as that for mainland China, from which little emigration to the United States existed from 1949 on. In 1979, the opening up of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the breaking of diplomatic relations with the Republic of China led to the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act, which placed Taiwan under a separate immigration group from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As a result of the Immigration Act of 1990, emigration from Hong Kong was also considered a separate jurisdiction for the purpose of recording such statistics. Thus, Mandarin-speaking emigrants from Taiwan began to arrive in the Bay Area, and they have tended to settle in suburban Millbrae, Cupertino, Milpitas, Mountain View, and even San Jose – avoiding San Francisco as well as Oakland Chinatowns.

====Gang violence====

With these changes came a weakening of the Tongs&#x27; traditional grip on Chinese life. Newer Chinese groups often came from areas outside of the Tongs&#x27; control, so the influence of the Tongs and criminal groups associated with them, such as the Triads, grew weaker in Chinatown and the Chinese community. However, the presence of the Asian gangs remained significant in the immigrant community, and in the summer of 1977, an ongoing rivalry between two street gangs, the Wah Ching and the Joe Boys, erupted in violence and bloodshed, culminating in a shooting spree at the Golden Dragon Restaurant on Washington Street. Five people were killed and eleven wounded, none of whom were gang members. The incident has become infamously known as the Golden Dragon massacre. Five perpetrators, who were members of the Joe Boys gang, were convicted of murder and assault charges and were sentenced to prison. The Golden Dragon closed in January 2006 because of health violations, and later reopened as the Imperial Palace Restaurant.

Other notorious acts of violence have taken place in Chinatown since 1977. At 2 a.m. on May 14, 1990, San Francisco residents who had just left The Purple Onion, a nightclub located where Chinatown borders on North Beach, were shot as they entered their cars. 35-year-old Michael Bit Chen Wu was killed and six others were injured, among them a critically wounded pregnant woman. In June 1998, shots were fired at Chinese Playground, wounding six teenagers, three of them critically. A 16-year-old boy was arrested for the shooting, which was believed to be gang-related. On February 27, 2006, Allen Leung was shot to death in his business on Jackson Street; Raymond &quot;Shrimp Boy&quot; Chow, who succeeded Leung as head of the Ghee Kung Tong, was later convicted in 2016 of soliciting Leung&#x27;s murder as fallout from the corruption investigation of Leland Yee, and Raymond &quot;Skinny Ray&quot; Lei was indicted for committing the murder in 2017.

==== Developments of tourism ====
As Chinatown&#x27;s ill reputation reemerged in the 1970s with the publicized gang crimes and continued neglect of substandard housing in the area, tourism began to decline. Visitors perceived the area as a &quot;ghetto&quot; taking their commercial business elsewhere. As Chinatown&#x27;s tourist industry suffered, the entire area&#x27;s once stable economy suffered. To counter this image, the Chinese Six Companies and other Chinese merchants began heavily emphasizing the safety and attractiveness of visiting the area. These marketing efforts alongside quieter initiatives to improve conditions for residents throughout the 1970s enabled the area&#x27;s tourism-dependent economy to continue functioning. Similar dynamics of area leaders internally addressing social issues while externally maintaining commercial tourist appeal continued to the end of the 1900s. Now, However, San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown is now shrinking and faces an existential threat to it survival, due to macroeconomic ills afflicting downtown and San Francisco as a whole, in addition to its aging infrastructure and residential inhabitants.

==Culture==

===Institutions===
San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown is home to the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (known as the Chinese Six Companies), which is the umbrella organization for local Chinese family and regional associations in this Chinatown. It has spawned lodges in other Western U.S. Chinatowns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Chinatown, Los Angeles and Chinatown, Portland.

The Chinese Culture Center is a community based non-profit organization located on the third floor of the Hilton San Francisco Financial District, across Kearny Street from Portsmouth Square. The Center promotes exhibitions about Chinese life in the United States and organizes tours of the area. The Chinese Historical Society of America is housed in a building designed by Julia Morgan as a YWCA, at 965 Clay.

===Events and festivals===
In the 1950s, during the Korean war, a number of Chinese-American leaders, led by W. K. Wong, organized the San Francisco Chinese New Year Festival and Parade, including art shows, street dances, martial arts, music, and a fashion show. The 1953 parade was led by Korean war veteran, Joe Wong, and featured the Miss Chinatown festival queen and the dragon. By 1958, the festival queen had been formally expanded into the pageant of &quot;Miss Chinatown U.S.A&quot;. In 1994, around 120 queer Asian Americans joined the annual parade, which was the first time that Asian American queer community had appeared in public and gained acceptance from Chinese-American society.

San Francisco Chinatown&#x27;s annual Autumn Moon Festival celebrates seasonal change and the opportunity to give thanks to a bountiful summer harvest. The Moon Festival is popularly celebrated throughout China and surrounding countries each year, with local bazaars, entertainment, and mooncakes, a pastry filled with sweet bean paste and egg. The festival is held each year during mid-September, and is free to the public.
Chinatown is frequently the venue of traditional Chinese funeral processions, where a marching band (playing Western songs such as &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;) takes the street with a motorcycle escort. The band is followed by a car displaying an image of the deceased (akin to the Chinese custom of parading a scroll with his or her name through the village), and the hearse and the mourners, who then usually travel to Colma south of San Francisco for the actual funeral. By union regulation, the procession route starts at the Green Street Mortuary proceeding on Stockton Street for six blocks and back on Grant Avenue, taking about one hour.

===Chinatown Community Development Center===
Chinatown Community Development Center is an organization formed in 1977 after the merger of the Chinatown Resource center and the Chinese Community Housing Corporation. The organization was started by Gordon Chin, who served as executive director since 1977 until he was succeeded by the organization&#x27;s Deputy Director Rev. Norman Fong on October 1, 2011. The organization advocates and provides services to San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. They have also started many groups, Adopt-An-Alleyway Youth Empowerment Project being the most notable, and have been involved with many tenant programs.

== Media and politics ==
In the citywide Board of Supervisors elections, Chinatown forms part of District Three and in 2014 accounted for 44% of both registered voters and ballots cast. The two main newspapers read among residents are Sing Tao Daily and World Journal.
==Fame==
San Francisco Chinatown restaurants are considered to be the birthplace of Americanized Chinese cuisine such as food items like Chop Suey while introducing and popularizing Dim Sum to American tastes, as its Dim Sum tea houses are a major tourist attraction. Johnny Kan was the proprietor of one of the first modern style Chinese restaurants, which opened in 1953. Many of the district&#x27;s restaurants have been featured in food television programs on Chinese cuisine such as Martin Yan&#x27;s &quot;Martin Yan - Quick &amp; Easy&quot;.

The Chinatown has served as a backdrop for several movies, television shows, plays and documentaries including &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, &quot;Chan Is Missing&quot;, &quot;Chinatown Kid&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, &quot;The Presidio&quot;, &quot;The Dead Pool, Jackie Chan Adventures,&quot; &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;, &quot;Godzilla,&quot; &quot;Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.&quot;

Noted Chinese American writers grew up there such as Russell Leong. Contrary to popular belief, while the Chinese-American writer Amy Tan was inspired by Chinatown and its culture for the basis of her book The Joy Luck Club and the subsequent movie, she did not grow up in this area; she was born and grew up in Oakland. Notable 1940s basketball player Willie &quot;Woo Woo&quot; Wong, who excelled in local schools, college and professional teams, was born in, and grew up playing basketball in, Chinatown; a local playground bears his name. Actor-martial artist Bruce Lee, who was born at San Francisco Chinese Hospital before moving back to Hong Kong three months later, returned to the United States at the age of eighteen, residing in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown for the first few months before moving to Seattle.

==Transportation==
San Francisco cable cars have long served areas of Chinatown; the modern system serves the southern (along California Street) and western (along Powell Street) sections of the neighborhood.

The Stockton Street Tunnel was completed in 1914 and brought San Francisco Municipal Railway Streetcar service to Stockton Street. After the tracks were removed, the overhead wires were maintained and buses replaced streetcars along the route. The &quot;30 Stockton&quot; and &quot;45 Union-Stockton&quot; are among the most heavily ridden lines in the system. Modern rail service has returned in the form of Chinatown station upon the completion of the Muni Metro&#x27;s Central Subway.

The Broadway Tunnel was completed in 1952 and was intended to serve as a connection between the Embarcadero Freeway and the Central Freeway. These plans did not materialize due to the highway revolts at the time. The tunnel currently serves to connect Chinatown with Russian Hill and Van Ness Avenue to the west.

In the 1980s, Chinatown merchants were opposed to the removal of the Embarcadero Freeway, but these objections were overturned after it was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, activist Rose Pak then &quot;almost single-handedly persuaded the city to build&quot; the $1.5 billion Central Subway project to compensate Chinatown for the demolition of the freeway.

The 49-Mile Scenic Drive is routed through Chinatown, with particular attention paid to the corner of Grant and Clay.

On October 20, 2022, Chinatown station was first shown to the public after years of development, with promises of completion of the station sometime in January. It opened with a soft launch as part of a shuttle service on November 12, 2022, introducing two new metro stations downtown before officially being connected to the T Third Street line on January 7, 2023.

<text>Donald Henry Segretti (born September 17, 1941, in San Marino, California) is an attorney best known for working as a political operative with then-U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Committee to Re-elect the President during the early 1970s. Segretti served four and a half months in prison after investigations related to the Watergate scandal revealed his leading role in extensive political sabotage efforts (&quot;ratfucking&quot;) against the Democrats.

==Early life==
He holds a Bachelor of Science in finance from the University of Southern California (1963) and a Juris Doctor from UC Berkeley School of Law (1966). While at USC, he was a member of the Trojan Knights and initiated into Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. He also was a member of Trojans for Representative Government with future Watergate scandal participants Dwight L. Chapin, Tim Elbourne, Gordon C. Strachan, Herbert Porter, and Ron Ziegler.

==Watergate==
Segretti was hired by his friend Dwight L. Chapin to run a campaign of dirty tricks – which Segretti referred to as &quot;ratfucking&quot; – against the Democrats, with his work being paid for by Herb Kalmbach, Nixon&#x27;s lawyer, from presidential campaign re-election funds gathered before an April 7, 1972 law required that contributors be identified. Segretti&#x27;s actions were part of the larger Watergate scandal and were important indicators for the few members of the press investigating the Watergate burglary in the early stages that what became known as the Watergate scandal involved far more than just a burglary.

===Overview of &quot;dirty tricks&quot; against Democrats===
Segretti&#x27;s involvement in the &quot;Canuck letter&quot; typifies the tactics Segretti and others working with him used; in this case, they forged a letter ascribed to Senator Edmund Muskie that maligned the people, language, and culture of French Canada and French Canadians, causing that Democratic presidential candidate considerable headaches by having to deny writing the letter and to continue dealing with that recurring issue. Many historians have indicated, over the years, that Muskie&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal from the presidential primaries was at least partly the result of Segretti and some of the other &quot;ratfuckers&quot; having created so much confusion and so many false accusations that Muskie simply could not respond in any meaningful way.

Another notable example of Segretti&#x27;s wrongdoing was a letter he faked, on Edmund Muskie&#x27;s letterhead, falsely alleging that U.S. Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, a fellow Democrat, had an illegitimate child with a 17-year-old. The &quot;Muskie letters&quot; also accused Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of sexual misconduct.

After testimony regarding the Muskie letters emerged, Democrats in Florida noted the similarity between those sabotage incidents and others that involved stationery stolen from Humphrey&#x27;s offices after Muskie dropped out of the race. For example, a false news release on Humphrey&#x27;s letterhead accused Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) of being &quot;mentally unbalanced&quot;, and a mailing with an unidentified source mischaracterized Humphrey as supporting a controversial environmental measure that he actually opposed.

Segretti appeared as a witness before the Senate Watergate Committee in October 1973.

===Imprisoned following Watergate conviction===
In 1974, Segretti pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of distributing illegal campaign literature (including the forgeries described above) and was sentenced to six months in prison. Segretti served four months.

==Later activities==
Segretti was a lawyer who served as a prosecutor for the U.S. Army and later as a civilian. However, his license was suspended on February 27, 1976. Segretti is currently shown as an active member in good standing of the State Bar of California.

===Unsuccessful bid for Orange County judgeship===
In 1995, Segretti ran for a local judgeship in Orange County, California. He quickly withdrew from the race when his campaign sparked lingering anger over memories of his involvement in the Watergate scandal.

===Orange County co-chair of McCain 2000 primary campaign===
In 2000, Segretti served as co-chair of John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign in Orange County, California.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, Segretti was portrayed by Robert Walden. The character downplayed the dirty tricks he had undertaken as &quot;Nickel-and-dime stuff. Stuff. Stuff with a little &#x27;wit&#x27; attached to it.&quot;

<text>Jayapura (formerly Hollandia) is the capital and largest city of the Indonesian province of Papua. It is situated on the northern coast of New Guinea island and covers an area of . The city borders the Pacific Ocean and Yos Sudarso Bay to the north, the country of Papua New Guinea to the east, Keerom Regency to the south, and Jayapura Regency to the west.

With a population of 398,478 according to the 2020 census, Jayapura is the most populous city in the entire island of New Guinea, surpassing Port Moresby, the national capital and largest city of Papua New Guinea. During the 2010-2020 decade it was also the fastest-growing city in Indonesia, with the population increasing by 55.23% between 2010 and 2020. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 414,862 (comprising 220,024 males and 194,838 females).

Jayapura is the fourth largest city by economy in Eastern Indonesia—after Makassar, Denpasar, and Manado—with an estimated 2016 GDP at Rp19.48 trillion. Jayapura has a very high Human Development Index (HDI) at 0.801.

==Etymology==
Jayapura is Sanskrit for &quot;city of victory&quot; (जय &quot;jaya&quot;: &quot;victory&quot;; पुर &quot;pura&quot;: &quot;city&quot;) and was named by Suharto as part of the de-Sukarnoization. Nowadays there are calls from some citizens, government officials and academicians, to rename the city to better reflect the locals like the naming of Youtefa Bridge. Some suggestions include &quot;Kota Tabi&quot; as the city is in the customary region of Tabi, &quot;Port Numbay&quot;, or just &quot;Numbay&quot; as &quot;Port&quot; is English and not a native word. The word &quot;Numbay&quot; comes from the river Numbay which flows to the city. It has the meaning &quot;clear water&quot; while &quot;Tabi&quot; means &quot;sunrise&quot; in the local Kayo Pulau language.

During the Dutch colonial era the city was called &quot;Hollandia&quot;, based on the Holland region. In 1945, the Dutch made Hollandia the capital of then Netherlands New Guinea. After the territory was handed over to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, on 1 October 1962, the city went by a dual Dutch/Indonesian name: &quot;Hollandia&quot;/&quot;Kota Baru&quot; (New Town). When Indonesia took control over the city on 1 May 1963, it became solely &quot;Kota Baru&quot;. In 1964, the city was briefly renamed &quot;Sukarnopura&quot;, after then-President Sukarno, until the end of 1968, when it acquired its present name.

==History==

Before its inclusion into the colonial government of the Dutch Indies, the location of present-day Jayapura was known as &quot;Numbay&quot;. Before the arrival of the Dutch there was an active trade in Numbay, centered on the Island of Metui Debi and the area where the former Gereja Pengharapan (&quot;Church of the Favor of God&quot;) stood, in Sam Ratulangi Road, being most active between 1897 and 1905. The mode of the trade was through barter for spices, cassava, salted fish and bird-of-paradise. The society of Numbay, or Tabi in general, was led by an &quot;ondoafi&quot; (chief of the tribe). By 1849, the Numbay region was a tributary of the Tidore Sultanate.

On 28 September 1909, a detachment of the Dutch navy under Captain F.J.P. Sachse came ashore at Humboldt Bay near the mouth of the Numbay river. Their task was the systematic exploration of northern New Guinea and the search for a natural border between the Dutch and German spheres on New Guinea. Their camp along the river was called Kloofkamp, a name still in use as the name of an ancient district of Jayapura. Forty coconut trees were cut down for the establishment of the camp. They were bought from the owners at a cost of one rijksdaalder per palm.

On 7 March 1910, the Dutch flag was raised and the settlement was named &quot;Hollandia&quot;. On the other side of the bay there was already a German camp, &quot;Germania-Huk&quot; (German Corner), which is now uninhabited and part of Indonesian territory. Hollandia was the capital of a district of the same name in the northeast of West New Guinea. The name Hollandia was used until 1962.

The northern part of Netherlands New Guinea was occupied by Japanese forces in 1942. Allied forces drove out the Japanese after Operations Reckless and Persecution, the amphibious landings near Hollandia, from 21 April 1944. The area&#x27;s Naval Base Hollandia, served as General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters until the conquest of the Philippines in March 1945. Over twenty U.S. bases were established and half a million US personnel moved through the area.

Jayapura was struck by the Aitape tsunami after the 1998 Papua New Guinea earthquake.

==Geography and climate==

The topography of Jayapura varies from valleys to hills, plateaus, and mountains up to above sea level. Jayapura overlooks the Yos Sudarso Bay. Jayapura is about in area, and is divided into five districts. Around 30% of the area is inhabited, with the remainder consisting of a rough terrain, swamps, and protected forest.

Jayapura has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.

==Administrative districts==

The city comprises five districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also lists the locations of the district headquarters, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 25 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; and 14 rural &quot;kampung&quot;), and its post codes.

Note: (a) the original 2020 Census figures were quoted as 303,760; this was drastically revised to 398,478, but the figures for the individual five districts have not been revised.

==Demographics==
As the capital of Papua Province with all the development undertaken, Jayapura City has become a &quot;magnet&quot; for settlers from other regions of Indonesia. Ethnic Javanese, Sundanese, Makasar, Buginese, Torajanese, Manadonese, Bataks, Moluccans, Madurese and so on, among others ethnicities of the nation that helped increase the population drastically in at least one decade. In addition to the label &quot;city of Education&quot; then has made this city a destination for residents from outside the city of Jayapura to find a job and also gain knowledge in several institutions in this city.

===Religion===

On 12 May 1949, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Prefecture of Hollandia was established in the city. In 1963, it was renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Kota Baru. In 1964, it was again renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Sukarnapura. It was promoted in 1966 as the Diocese of Sukarnapura, renamed in 1969 as the Diocese of Djajapura and since 1973 spelled as Diocese of Jayapura.

== Economy ==
The highest economic growth of Jayapura city compared to other districts/municipalities in the province of Papua has had implications for the increased income and purchasing power of the people. The economic growth is largely contributed from the tertiary sector, where trade and services and finance dominate its contribution to the formation of GRDP.

The sharp gap/disparity of income, and the high rate of poverty (28.44% at less than $3.10/day PPP) and unemployment rate with low labor force participation rate (57.26%). Another weakness is the not yet optimal use of agriculture (in the broad sense) as one of the supporters of the regional economy that has a competitive advantage. Tourism developments, marked by the growing tourism industry and domestic and foreign tourist arrivals in Jayapura City, have provided opportunities for various sectors to flourish, especially income generation for the indigenous people of Port Numbay in Jayapura city.

With the development of trade and service activities supported by the increasing availability of trade and service facilities that lead to increased private investment in the trade and tourism services sector and other sectors. This condition also needs to be supported by the protection policy for the indigenous people of Port Numbay to be prioritized in taking the opportunity to compete healthily, especially in the field of trade, investment and tourism sector.

The economic condition of the indigenous people of Port Numbay, particularly in the context of economic competition in the city of Jayapura, is still at a low level with the lack of capital and skills possessed and with increasingly depleted natural resources.

With the skills and knowledge that still rely on subsistence economic activities such as sago concocting activities, catching fish in the sea, shifting cultivation to indigenous people of Port Numbay, it is enough left behind with other ethnic in Jayapura city that competes in trade and service which is economic modern with profit from the subsistence economy. However, by utilizing the customary rights area along the coast that became the coastal tourist attraction, some of the inhabitants of Port Numbay Original have competed in the service sector even on a small scale and limited capital. This is done by indigenous villagers Kayu Batu on BaseG beach in North Jayapura, Hamadi beach in South Jayapura and on Holtekam beach, Skow Mabo and Skow in Muara Tami district.

While competition in the field of trade is still limited to the natives of Port Numbay because it is still in small scale and is subsistence economy. Among other things, the sale of crops such as marine fish, long-term crops such as coconut, areca nut and others that more levels of economic competition with other ethnic Jayapura in the same merchandise, and with a larger scale.

==Transport==

Jayapura is served by Sentani International Airport, located at Sentani town in Jayapura Regency some 40 kms west of the city, and near Lake Sentani.

A highway connects the city eastwards to Skouw, a village near the border with Papua New Guinea and continues beyond the border to Vanimo. The city has connection to other towns and cities such as Sarmi and Wamena via the Trans-Papua Highway.

Bus terminals in Jayapura include Terminal Entrop and Terminal Mesran. Trans Jayapura bus rapid transit, operated by the city government via Pikoum cooperative, is operating within the city since 2019 with four corridors starting from both terminals.

The government is currently planning to build a railway from Jayapura to Sarmi, a distance of some 400 km. Further plans could subsequently extend this to connect Jayapura with Manokwari and Sorong. The project is planned for completion by 2030.

==Sport==
Jayapura is the home of the Persipura, a professional football club that has produced many famous Papuan-Indonesian footballers and have won the Liga Indonesia/Indonesia Super League four times in the 2005, 2008–09, 2010–11 and the 2012–13 seasons.

<text>Ronald Belford &quot;Bon&quot; Scott (9 July 1946 – 19 February 1980) was an Australian singer who was the second lead vocalist and lyricist of the hard rock band AC/DC from 1974 until his death in 1980. In the July 2004 issue of &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Scott was ranked number one in a list of the &quot;100 Greatest Frontmen of All Time&quot;.&quot; Hit Parader&quot; ranked Scott as fifth on their 2006 list of the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of all time.

Born in Forfar in Angus, Scotland, Scott spent his early years in Kirriemuir. He moved to Australia with his family in 1952 at the age of six, living in Melbourne for four years before settling in Fremantle, Western Australia. Scott formed his first band, the Spektors, in 1964 and became the band&#x27;s drummer and occasional lead vocalist. He performed in several other bands, including the Valentines and Fraternity, before replacing original AC/DC lead singer Dave Evans in 1974.

With AC/DC Scott performed on the band&#x27;s first seven albums: &quot;High Voltage&quot; (1975, Australian only release), &quot;T.N.T.&quot; (1975, Australian only release), &quot;High Voltage&quot; (1976, first international release), &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; (1976, not released until 1981 in the United States), &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; (1977), &quot;Powerage&quot; (1978) and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (1979). AC/DC&#x27;s popularity grew throughout the 1970s, initially in Australia, and then internationally. Their 1979 album &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; reached the top 20 in the United States, and was their commercial breakthrough. However, on 19 February 1980, Scott died after a night out in London with former musician and alleged drug dealer Alistair Kinnear. AC/DC briefly considered disbanding, but the group recruited vocalist Brian Johnson of the British glam rock band Geordie. AC/DC&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;Back in Black&quot;, was released only five months later, and was a tribute to Scott. It is currently the second-best-selling album of all time.

==Biography==

=== 1946–1964: early years ===
Ronald Belford Scott was born on 9 July 1946 at Fyfe Jamieson Maternity Hospital in Forfar, Scotland, to Charles Belford &quot;Chick&quot; Scott (1917–1999) and Isabelle Cunningham &quot;Isa&quot; Mitchell (1917–2011). He grew up in Kirriemuir and was the Scotts&#x27; second child; their first was a boy born in 1943, Sandy, who died shortly after birth. A third child, Derek, was born in 1949. Chick and Isa ran the family bakery in Kirriemuir&#x27;s Bank Street. The family emigrated from Scotland to Australia in 1952.

The Scotts lived in the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, Victoria, and Scott attended nearby Sunshine Primary School. The nickname &quot;Bon&quot; was acquired shortly after starting school; because there was another Ronald in the class, his classmates played on the phrase &quot;Bonnie Scotland&quot;. A fourth child, Graeme, was born in 1953.

In 1956, the family moved to Fremantle, Western Australia. Scott joined the associated Fremantle Scots Pipe Band, learning the drums. He attended North Fremantle Primary School and later John Curtin College of the Arts until he dropped out at the age of 15. He subsequently worked as a farmhand and a crayfisherman, and was later a trainee weighing-machine mechanic. In 1963 he spent a short time in Fremantle Prison&#x27;s assessment centre and nine months at the Riverbank Juvenile Institution, relating to charges of giving a false name and address to the police, having escaped legal custody, having unlawful carnal knowledge, and stealing of petrol. He attempted to join the Australian Army, but was rejected and deemed &quot;socially maladjusted&quot;.

===1964–1970: The Spektors and The Valentines===
Scott&#x27;s vocals were inspired by his idol, Little Richard. After working as a postman, bartender and truck packer, Scott started his first band, The Spektors, in 1964 as drummer and occasional lead singer. In 1966, they merged with another local band, the Winstons, and formed The Valentines, in which Scott was co-lead singer with Vince Lovegrove. The Valentines recorded several songs written by George Young of The Easybeats. &quot;Every Day I Have to Cry&quot; (a song originally written and sung by Arthur Alexander) made the local record chart. In 1970, after gaining a place on the National Top 30 with their single &quot;Juliette&quot;, The Valentines disbanded due to artistic differences after a much-publicised drug scandal.

===1970–1973: Fraternity and The Mount Lofty Rangers===
Scott moved to Adelaide in 1970 and joined the progressive rock group Fraternity. Fraternity released the LPs &quot;Livestock&quot; and &quot;Flaming Galah&quot; before touring the UK in 1973, where they changed their name to Fang. During this time they played support slots for Status Quo and Geordie, whose front man Brian Johnson would eventually succeed Scott as the lead singer of AC/DC after his death. During this time, on 24 January 1972, Scott married Irene Thornton.

In 1973, just after returning to Australia from the tour of the UK, Fraternity went on hiatus. Scott took a day job at the Wallaroo fertiliser plant and began singing with The Mount Lofty Rangers, a loose collective of musicians helmed by Peter Head (né Beagley) from Headband, who explained, &quot;Headband and Fraternity were in the same management stable and we both split about the same time so the logical thing was to take members from both bands and create a new one ... the purpose of the band was for songwriters to relate to each other and experiment with songs, so it was a hotbed of creativity&quot;. Other ex-Fraternity members also played with the band as did Glenn Shorrock pre Little River Band. During this time, Head also helped Scott with his original compositions.

Vince Lovegrove said, &quot;Bon would go to Peter&#x27;s home after a day of (literally) shovelling shit, and show him musical ideas he had had during his day&#x27;s work. Bon&#x27;s knowledge of the guitar was limited, so Peter began teaching him how to bridge chords and construct a song. One of the songs from these sessions was a ballad called &#x27;Clarissa&#x27;, about a local Adelaide girl. Another was the country-tinged &#x27;Bin Up in the Hills Too Long&#x27;, which for me was a sign of things to come with Bon&#x27;s lyrics; simple, clever, sardonic, tongue-in-cheek ...&quot;

In return, Scott recorded vocals for Mount Lofty Rangers songs &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot; and &quot;Carey Gully&quot;. Head released these original recordings in 1996, also teaming up with producer Ted Yanni, another old friend of Scott&#x27;s, to create an entirely new backing for &quot;Round &amp; Round &amp; Round&quot; that more accurately reflected the original intentions Head had. Long out of print, and massively bootlegged, this EP finally got an official digital release in June 2010. Unrecorded original compositions of Scott&#x27;s, &quot;Been Up in the Hills Too Long&quot; and &quot;Clarissa&quot; have been recorded by Head on his Peter Head &amp; the Mount Lofty Rangers &quot;Lofty&quot; album, also released in digital format only in 2011.

About 11 pm on 3 May 1974, at the Old Lion Hotel in North Adelaide, during a rehearsal with the Mount Lofty Rangers, a very drunk, distressed and belligerent Scott had a raging argument with a member of the band. Scott stormed out of the venue, threw a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s to the ground, then sped off on his Suzuki GT550 motorbike. Scott suffered serious injuries from the ensuing motorcycle accident, spending three days in a coma and a further 18 days in hospital. During his recovery Vince Lovegrove and his wife gave Scott odd jobs, such as putting up posters and painting the office for their nascent booking/management agency. Shortly afterward, Lovegrove introduced him to AC/DC, who had been on the lookout for a new lead singer.

&quot;There was a young, dinky little glam band from Sydney that we both loved called AC/DC ... Before another AC/DC visit, George Young phoned me and said the band was looking for a new singer. I immediately told him that the best guy for the job was Bon. George responded by saying Bon&#x27;s accident would not allow him to perform, and that maybe he was too old (9 years older than Angus at the time). Nevertheless, I had a meeting with Malcolm and Angus, and suggested Bon as their new singer. They asked me to bring him out to the Pooraka Hotel that night, and to come backstage after the show. When he watched the band, Bon was impressed, and he immediately wanted to join them, but thought they may be a bit too inexperienced and too young. After the show, backstage, Bon expressed his doubts about them being &quot;able to rock&quot;. The two Young brothers told Bon he was &quot;too old to rock&quot;. The upshot was that they had a jam session that night in the home of Bon&#x27;s former mentor, Bruce Howe, and at the end of the session, at dawn, it was obvious that AC/DC had found a new singer. And Bon had found a new band.&quot;

Fraternity later reformed and replaced Scott with Jimmy Barnes.

===1974–1980: AC/DC===
Scott&#x27;s wife, Irene Thornton, later wrote, &quot;The first time Bon saw AC/DC was in August 1974. They came through Adelaide with the Lou Reed and Stevie Wright tour, and played their own show at the Pooraka Hotel... The first time I saw AC/DC was at the Pooraka Hotel in September. &#x27;Get up there, Bon,&#x27; Vince kept saying. The band didn&#x27;t have a singer that night; they were playing instrumental versions of old rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll standards. The boys ripped through all these classic numbers and then finally, with enough pressure from Vince, Bon climbed onto the stage. I didn&#x27;t realise that AC/DC had just sacked Dave Evans and they wanted Bon to replace him. Like Bon, the Youngs were Scottish, so there was an instant bond.&quot;

Scott replaced Dave Evans as the lead singer of AC/DC on 24 October 1974, when it became obvious the band and Evans were heading in different directions, with Evans having personal clashes with band members and management. Scott&#x27;s appointment coincided with him working as a chauffeur for the band at the time until an audition promoted him to lead singer.

With the Young brothers as lead and rhythm guitarists, session drummer Tony Currenti (see AC/DC line-ups) and George Young as a temporary bassist, AC/DC released &quot;High Voltage&quot;, their first LP in Australia, in February 1975. Within a few months Currenti was replaced by Phil Rudd and Mark Evans was hired as a permanent bassist, and AC/DC began recording their second album &quot;T.N.T.&quot;, which was released in Australia in December 1975. The first AC/DC album to gain international distribution however was a compilation of tracks from the first two albums, also titled &quot;High Voltage&quot;, which was released in May 1976. Another studio album, &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;, was released in September of the same year, but only in Australia; the international version of the album was released in December with a different track listing. The album was not released in the US until March 1981.

In the following years, AC/DC gained further success with their albums &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; and &quot;Powerage&quot;. The 1978 release of &quot;Powerage&quot; marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams (who had replaced Mark Evans), and with its harder riffs, followed the blueprint set by &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;. Only one single was released from &quot;Powerage&quot;—&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Damnation&quot;—which gave AC/DC their highest chart position at the time, reaching #24. An appearance at The Apollo, Glasgow, during the &quot;Powerage&quot; tour was recorded and released as &quot;If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It&quot;.

The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, was produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange and was released in 1979. It became AC/DC&#x27;s first LP to break the US top 100, eventually reaching #17, and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard-rock acts.

On 9 February 1980; AC/DC appeared on &quot;Aplauso TV&quot; (Spain) where they played &quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot;, &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot;, and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, this would be Bon Scott&#x27;s last appearance with AC/DC before his death.

==Personal life==
Scott met Irene Thornton, from Adelaide, in 1971 while he was the lead singer for Fraternity. They married in 1972. The couple separated after two years of marriage and divorced in 1977, but remained friends until Scott&#x27;s death. After Thornton, Scott had a significant ongoing relationship with Margaret &quot;Silver&quot; Smith, whom he had met in Adelaide in the early 1970s. Scott and Smith broke up in 1977 but were in touch until his death.

Michael Browning, who managed AC/DC in their early years, stated in his book on managing AC/DC, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, that he visited Scott in hospital in Melbourne in 1975 after Scott had overdosed on drugs. Browning claimed &quot;Bon was bragging to me the last time he was in that hospital he was visiting two separate girls, both unknown to each other, who were both giving birth to his kids at the same time. So there&#x27;s at least two of Bon Scott&#x27;s children out there, or at least two I can vouch for.&quot;

==Death==
On 15 February 1980, Scott attended a session where Malcolm and Angus Young were working on the beginnings of two songs that would later be recorded on the &quot;Back in Black&quot; album: &quot;Have a Drink On Me&quot; and &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot;, with Scott accompanying on drums rather than singing or writing lyrics. Young has also claimed Scott played drums on &quot;Hells Bells&quot; while AC/DC drummer Simon Wright has claimed Angus Young played him a demo of Scott playing drums on &quot;Back in Black&quot;.

Days earlier, Scott had gone with Mick Cocks to visit their friends the French group Trust in the Scorpio Sound studio in London, where they recorded the album &quot;Répression&quot;; Scott was working on the English adaptation of texts by Bernie Bonvoisin for the English version of the album. During this visit, the musicians did a jam session of &quot;Ride On&quot;. This improvised session was Scott&#x27;s last recording.

Sometime during the late evening of 18 February and early morning of Tuesday, 19 February 1980, Scott passed out and died at the age of 33. He had just visited a London club called the Music Machine (currently known as KOKO). He was allegedly left to sleep in a Renault 5 owned by his friend Alistair Kinnear, at 67 Overhill Road in East Dulwich. Later that day, Kinnear found Scott unconscious and alerted the authorities. Scott was taken to King&#x27;s College Hospital in Camberwell, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The official report of the coroner concluded that Scott had died of &quot;acute alcohol poisoning&quot; and classified it as &quot;death by misadventure&quot;.

In 1994, when Clinton Walker published his book &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, it portrayed Scott as moving in drug-heavy circles in his final days in London but was emphatic that even as an alcoholic and inveterate pot-smoker he was not a co-dependent heroin user, and it supported the coroner’s findings. An alternative account of Bon Scott&#x27;s death, however, has been made by Australian author Jesse Fink in his book &quot;Bon: The Last Highway&quot;, which was first published in 2017.

The chronology of events on 19 February, Kinnear&#x27;s account of what happened, and when exactly Scott was found dead was disputed in &quot;Bon: The Last Highway&quot;. In the book Zena Kakoulli, a heroin user and wife of Only Ones vocalist Peter Perrett, admitted to Fink she was with Scott and Kinnear: &quot;I was there when he died, as I spent the night at Alistair&#x27;s flat... I went back with Alistair and [Bon] to Alistair&#x27;s flat. It was very late when we got back and I remember it being very cold. [My husband] Peter [Perrett] did not go with us that night.&quot;

Fink then asked Kakoulli if she thought Scott had used heroin: &quot;I didn&#x27;t see him taking heroin, but both Alistair and Silver were users at the time. I would think it probable that [Bon] did take heroin as I would not have thought somebody that was used to drinking would have been sick. It&#x27;s well known that if you take heroin when you have been drinking, especially if you don’t normally, it could lead to you vomiting, plus cause you to pass out. But I can only presume that&#x27;s what caused him to fall asleep and later vomit. He didn&#x27;t seem unreasonably intoxicated. If he had taken heroin it was with Silver and Alistair at the venue [The Music Machine]; I didn’t see him [take heroin].&quot;

Kakoulli&#x27;s sister, the late Koulla Kakoulli, who saw Scott that night, also believed Scott used heroin. She told Fink: &quot;Bon had a lot to drink that night. And I would be very surprised if he too [like Alistair] didn’t take a lot of drugs that evening, mainly heroin. I don’t wanna upset anybody this late in the game. End of the day it was a tragic accident. But [speaking] as an ex-junkie, Bon looked stoned.&quot; Koulla Kakoulli died in 2018.

But, despite Zena Kakoulli&#x27;s recollection that she was alone with Kinnear and Scott, an updated edition of Fink&#x27;s book in 2022 produces new evidence from a 2009 French magazine interview with deceased journalist Guillaume B. Decherf that Zena Kakoulli&#x27;s husband, Peter Perrett, was actually with Scott, Kinnear and Kakoulli.

Fink writes: &quot;Perrett told Decherf he had met Bon for the first and only time at The Music Machine; that he and Zena had used heroin that night; that neither of them were called as witnesses by police; that he suspected Bon mixed heroin and alcohol, which later caused Bon to throw up; and that he believed Bon was there at the venue to procure heroin, likely from Alistair. Sensationally, Perrett also stated he went with Zena, Alistair and Bon back to Alistair&#x27;s apartment in East Dulwich.&quot;

In conclusion, Fink contends that pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott&#x27;s death via a suspected heroin overdose. He establishes that Scott&#x27;s blood alcohol content (BAC) was .208. 
In 2024, Fink released &quot;Bon: Notes from the Highway&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Bon: The Last Highway&quot;. In the book Fink interviews Liz Elliot, a friend of Kinnear&#x27;s, who claims Kinnear visited her and her partner&#x27;s home following Scott&#x27;s death and admitted to giving Scott heroin. 

&quot;We were at home in Ladbroke Grove the day a distraught Alistair came round and told us that Bon had died. I understood it to have happened in the back of Alistair&#x27;s white van, that they’d been drinking, Bon had had some smack and, unable to wake him, Alistair had thrown a blanket over him and next day found him dead... we were worried for Alistair himself because he had, at Bon&#x27;s request, provided the heroin. [My partner] Brian suggested it might be a good idea if Alistair dropped out of view for a while although we reckoned that the alcohol would be given as cause of death for the sake of the band and the fact Bon was a teenager&#x27;s hero.&quot;

&quot;When the alcohol verdict was announced we wondered who had paid off who but it was a great relief to all of us, especially Alistair, who’d come round a couple of times in the interim – but I knew he’d never quite forgive himself... I guess they weren&#x27;t looking for it so much in those days or perhaps they were trying to keep the statistics down – who knows?&quot;

In 2023, Clinton Walker published an expanded third edition of &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. The author counters that since all the new eyewitnesses Fink uncovered state they did not actually see Scott take any heroin, and since the fact remains that the coroner found nothing in his bloodstream but alcohol, there is still no hard evidence that heroin was involved in his death.

As part of the funeral arrangements, Scott&#x27;s body was embalmed by Desmond Henley; it was later cremated, and Scott&#x27;s ashes were interred by his family at Fremantle Cemetery in Fremantle.

Shortly after Scott&#x27;s death, the remaining members of AC/DC briefly considered disbanding. However, it was eventually decided that Scott would have wanted them to continue, and with the Scott family&#x27;s encouragement, the band hired Brian Johnson as their new vocalist. Before his death, Scott had praised Johnson and the performer&#x27;s group Geordie to his friends, comparing the other vocalist to Little Richard and remarking (according to Angus Young) along the lines that Scott had found &quot;a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about&quot;.

==Lyrics controversy==

Five months after Scott&#x27;s death, AC/DC finished the work they had begun with Scott; they released &quot;Back in Black&quot; as a tribute to him, but his name did not appear in the writing credits. The issue of whether Scott&#x27;s lyrics were used, uncredited, on the album is an enduring topic of debate.

==Legacy==
===Landmarks===
====Australia====

Scott&#x27;s grave site in Palmyra has become a cultural landmark. More than 28 years after his death, the National Trust of Australia declared his grave important enough to be included on the list of classified heritage places. It is reportedly the most visited grave in Australia. On 7 July 2006, to mark his 60th birthday, the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board completed refurbishments on the Bon Scott Grave Area. This consisted of a Bon Scott Arch and Memorial Entrance gate off Carrington Street in the north-west corner of Fremantle Cemetery. On 9 July 2006, sixty years to the day from Scott&#x27;s birth, the bronze plaque was stolen from the site.

A bronze statue of Scott was unveiled at Fremantle Fishing Boat Harbour in Western Australia on 24 February 2008. The statue portrays Scott atop a Marshall amplifier.

ACDC Lane is a street in the Melbourne central business district. It was renamed on 1 October 2004 as a tribute to AC/DC. The trademark lightning bolt or slash (&quot;/&quot;) used to separate the AC and the DC in the band&#x27;s name contravened the naming policy of the Office of the Registrar of Geographic Names, so the punctuation was omitted on the street sign. Melbourne&#x27;s Lord Mayor John So launched ACDC Lane with the words, &quot;As the song says, there is a highway to hell, but this is a laneway to heaven. Let us rock&quot;. Bagpipers then played &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;. Those were all songs from Bon Scott era. The lane contains a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll nightclub called the Cherry Bar.

====Scotland====
On 6 May 2006, the town of Kirriemuir in Scotland held a service and unveiled a Caithness stone slab commemorating the singer. A message was read from a long-time friend and fellow member of the Valentines, Vince Lovegrove, in which he said:

A life-sized bronze statue of Scott was unveiled by former AC/DC bass player Mark Evans in Bellies Brae Car Park in Kirriemuir on 30 April 2016, during the 10th anniversary of the Bonfest music festival. Kirriemuir hosts an annual festival known as &quot;Bonfest&quot; as a tribute to Bon Scott and AC/DC. It was originally held in July on the weekend closest to his birthday but moved to May because of other events in the local area during July. The statue was commissioned by local community group DD8 Music and created by John McKenna.

===Posthumous releases===
AC/DC released a box set entitled &quot;Bonfire&quot; as a tribute to Scott on 18 November 1997. It contains four albums; a remastered version of &quot;Back in Black&quot;; a &quot;rarities&quot; album with alternate takes, outtakes, and stray live cuts, &quot;Volts&quot;; and two live albums, &quot;Live from the Atlantic Studios&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock: The Movie&quot;. &quot;Live from the Atlantic Studios&quot; was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York City. &quot;Let There Be Rock: The Movie&quot; is a double album which was recorded on 9 December 1979 at the Pavillon de Paris in Paris, and was the soundtrack of the motion picture, &quot;AC/DC: Let There Be Rock&quot;.

===Accolades, awards and tributes===
AC/DC&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Back in Black&quot; was released as a dedication and tribute to Scott. In 2003, Scott was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of AC/DC with his nephews present to accept the honour in his place.

In 2003, Scott&#x27;s final studio album with AC/DC, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; ranked 199 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2004, the song &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; that Scott co-wrote with Malcolm and Angus Young ranked 254 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

In the July 2004 issue of UK magazine &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Scott was rated as number one in a list of the &quot;100 Greatest Frontmen&quot;, ahead of Freddie Mercury and Robert Plant.

The French rock band Trust wrote their hit song &quot;Ton dernier acte&quot; (&quot;Your Last Act&quot;) in memory of Scott in 1980. German hard rock band Kingdom Come wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Bon Scott&quot; for their album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Crying for the Moon&quot;, as a tribute to the former AC/DC frontman. Romanian hard rock group Iris recorded the song &quot;Ultimul mic dejun al lui Bon&quot; (&quot;Bon&#x27;s Last Breakfast&quot;) as a tribute to Scott, released on their 1997 album &quot;Lună plină&quot;.

Many artists perform live covers of songs that Scott wrote with AC/DC as a tribute to him. On 19 February 2005, the 25th anniversary of Scott&#x27;s death, thrash metal band Megadeth performed a cover of &quot;Problem Child&quot; as a tribute. Singer and guitarist Dave Mustaine talked about how much Scott had influenced him. Hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses frequently perform &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; in concert and covered it in 1987. AC/DC performed their song &quot;Ride On&quot; only one time in 2001 as a tribute to Scott.

===Literature===
Scott is the subject of several books including two biographies by Jesse Fink - &quot;Bon: The Last Highway&quot; (2017, updated in 2018 and 2022) and &quot;Bon: Notes from the Highway&quot; (2024) - and Clinton Walker&#x27;s &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (1994 and updated in 2015 and 2023). Fink&#x27;s books claim that Scott died from a lethal combination of alcohol and heroin, while Walker backs the coroner&#x27;s finding of alcohol poisoning. The controversial point that he and Walker both agree on is that many of Scott&#x27;s lyrics were co-opted, uncredited, into &quot;Back in Black&quot;. Other books about Scott include Irene Thornton&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Bon Scott&quot; (2014, retitled outside Australia as &quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot;), Mary Renshaw&#x27;s &quot;Live Wire&quot; (2015) and Victor Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Fraternity: Pub Rock Pioneers&quot; (2021).

===Film===

In 2024 it was reported a feature film called &quot;The Kid from Harvest Road&quot; was being made of Scott&#x27;s time in Western Australia before he became a musician.

<text>The Oregon Coast is a coastal region of the U.S. state of Oregon. It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to its west and the Oregon Coast Range to the east, and stretches approximately from the California state border in the south to the Columbia River in the north. The region is not a specific geological, environmental, or political entity, and includes the Columbia River Estuary.

The Oregon Beach Bill of 1967 allows free beach access to everyone. In return for a pedestrian easement and relief from construction, the bill eliminates property taxes on private beach land and allows its owners to retain certain beach land rights.

Traditionally, the Oregon Coast is regarded as three distinct sub–regions:
* The North Coast, which stretches from the Columbia River to Cascade Head.
* The Central Coast, which stretches from Cascade Head to Reedsport.
* The South Coast, which stretches from Reedsport to the Oregon–California border.

The largest city is Coos Bay, population 16,700 in Coos County on the South Coast. U.S. Route 101 is the primary highway from Brookings to Astoria and is known for its scenic overlooks of the Pacific Ocean. Over 80 state parks and recreation areas dot the Oregon Coast. However, only a few highways cross the Coast Range to the interior: US 30, US 26, OR 6, OR 22,US 20, OR 18, OR 34, OR 126, OR 38, and OR 42. OR 18 and US 20 are considered among the dangerous roads in the state.

The Oregon Coast includes Clatsop County, Tillamook County, Lincoln County, western Lane County, western Douglas County, Coos County, and Curry County.

==Geography==

The Oregon Coast is divided into three different regions based on their geological formations: the North Coast, Central Coast, and South Coast. Three primary landforms appear along its shoreline: sea cliffs, beaches, and stacks. Minor land variation, city size, and socioeconomic differences between the North and Central regions cause division between them to be made along geological lines.

===North Coast===
The North Coast, which stretches from the Columbia River to Cascade Head, possesses longer stretches of unbroken beach (due to silt deposits washed southwards from the Columbia River), a higher concentration of logging zones, and larger, but less frequent sandbar-enclosed bays. Astoria serves as a staging ground for ships entering and leaving the Columbia River, because of the dangerous Columbia Bar. Ships wishing to make the passage require the aid of specially trained bar pilots. Along the coast are the cities of Seaside, Cannon Beach and Tillamook. Seaside and Cannon Beach lie directly on the Pacific Ocean, whereas Tillamook lies inland along Tillamook Bay. Because of the low lands that exist on this region of coast, flooding is an annual problem, especially in the winter, when storms push in from the North Pacific. Tillamook is particularly affected by these yearly floods, because of its location on a major floodplain. Sandstone cliffs occur rather sporadically in this region. This is due to relatively slow uplift rates as well as fairly constant sediment wash from the Columbia River. Future uplift from the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate will eventually create sandstone cliffs similar to those found further south and north. The North Oregon Coast is also a part of the Graveyard of the Pacific.

The weather on the North Coast is moderate. The average low in the winter is just under , while the high temperature is just above . The average high reaches its peak in early September at . The most rain occurs in November and December averaging over each month. July and August are the driest averaging under of rain each month. Most days are cloudy or partly cloudy throughout the year. The summer has the most sun with approximately half the days sunny or partly cloudy.

===Central Coast===
The Central Coast, which extends from Cascade Head to Reedsport, while similar to the North Coast, possesses fewer sandy beaches, more sea cliffs and terraces, and a greater number of bays. Several small urban areas exist in this region. Among these are the cities of Lincoln City, Depoe Bay, Newport, Waldport, and Yachats. Because the usable lands of the region are squeezed between the mountains and the ocean, most urban areas are relatively small but are still larger than those of the South Coast region. The southernmost area of Central coast is the intermediary zone for this region and the more mountainous South Coast region. Exposed sandstone cliffs are also common along the beaches and highway. Local sandstones of the Central Coast were uplifted during the Neogene Era. Higher layers of exposed sandstone are often varying shades of orange, and are often quite soft to the touch, often being very brittle, and relatively easily eroded. Lower exposed layers, though less frequent, reveal harder sandstone deposits. Unlike the higher layers, they are often gray-brown in color and hard in comparison. This lower sandstone often breaks off in large, squared chunks.

The weather on the central coast is similar to that of the north coast except the frequency of sunny or partly cloudy days is higher in the summer, approaching 75%.

===South Coast===
The South Coast region, which extends from Reedsport to the California border, is distinct from the North and Central Coast regions because of its mountainous nature, due to tectonic uplift and terrane accretion in ancient times. Much of the coastline in this region is made up of sea cliffs and miles of beaches. Among the landscape of the region exists the Oregon Dunes. There are seven incorporated cities on the south coast: Reedsport, North Bend, Coos Bay, Bandon, Port Orford, Gold Beach, and Brookings. Cape Blanco, which is approximately north of Port Orford, is the westernmost point in Oregon. Cape Blanco extends further west than any point of land in the contiguous United States (lower 48 states) except Cape Alava, in Washington. Though the landforms of the region are relatively consistent, the South Coast shows a change in ecology. It is in this region that the western redcedar and Sitka spruce forests give way to the more southerly coast redwood, Port Orford cedar, and Douglas-fir forests, which also include the northern extent of Oregon Myrtle trees (aka California Bay Laurel).

The weather on the south coast is similar to that of the north and central coasts except the frequency of sunny or partly cloudy days is higher in the summer, approaching 90%.

==Ecology==

Because of the Oregon Coast&#x27;s physical complexity, many different species of plant and animal can be found in the region, both terrestrial and marine in nature. However, past human interaction has caused a decline in several species of animal along the coast, such as the sea otter.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPB 2020/11/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Strict regulations as well as modern human aid has seen a return of some species in recent years.

The Oregon Coast is the location of the Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which consists of six wildlife refuges, covering , spread over a distance of .
===Land===
Due to several factors, including climate, weather, and terrain, there is a great variety of plants within the coast region. In some areas, large trees are uncommon. This is because severe winter storms and poor soil limit the growing height of many species. Shore pine &quot;(Pinus contorta subsp.contorta)&quot; are common in these areas. However several species of fir, pine, and cedar can be found, including a few endemic species, such as the Port Orford cedar &quot;(Chamaecyparis lawsoniana)&quot;. Because of this, logging has been a historically viable trade for the region. In the North Coast region near Astoria, and in Lincoln County, large tracts of land are second and third generation woodland, having been logged and replanted in the past.

Because of the salt carried inland by constant onshore winds, only the hardiest varieties of small plant can thrive close to shore. Coastal strawberry and Pacific silverweed are common along the coast due to their reproductive advantages and salt tolerance.

Like many forested regions of the western United States and Canada, many large species of animal can be found in the woods of the region. Most common are the Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer, as well as bobcats and North American cougar. All four species, though common now, were uncommon in the past, having moved more heavily into the region with the beginning of timber harvest. Likewise, smaller species, including nutrias and Virginia opossum can also be found, as well as the Townsend&#x27;s mole, which inhabits many lowland and floodplain areas.

===Marine===
The marine ecology of the Oregon Coast is some of the most diverse in the world. More than 29 species of marine mammals make their home on the Oregon Coast, including several species of seal, including the Steller&#x27;s sea lion and harbor seal, as well as the less common northern elephant seal and California sea lion. The Sea Lion Caves near Florence, and the bay front in Newport are the best places to see Steller&#x27;s sea lions and harbor seals, though they can be observed in many other places. Seal pups can sometimes be seen on sandy beaches resting. Signs are often posted on beaches warning of this, as the law prohibits disturbing them. Formerly, populations of sea otter could be found on the coast. However, fur hunters have wiped out the Oregon populations. Prior to the sighting in February 2009 in Depoe Bay, no sea otters had been sighted in over 103 years. Occasionally, large Humboldt Squid wash up onto the beaches after following warm currents which dissipate leaving the squid to die of hypothermia.

Several species of whale can be observed in the waters near shore, especially during migration in late December and late March, such as gray whale, orca, and humpback whale. Harbor porpoises are also relatively common. Because of this, whale watching is a common tourist attraction along the coast. Tour boats often take passengers on whale watching tours, though it is possible to do so from shore. It is sometimes the case that whale carcasses are beached on Oregon shores. One such beaching, which occurred near Florence in November, 1970, was handled by blowing it up using dynamite. This has become the well-known exploding whale incident.
Tidepools, which occur frequently along Oregon&#x27;s rocky shores, are unique, contained ecosystems housing up to many hundreds of species of animal. Red, green, and brown algae are common sights. Many species of invertebrates can also be found in these coastal tidepools, and include sponges, sea anemones, mussels, sea stars, limpets, crabs, shrimp, barnacles, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. Sunset Bay State Park, near Coos Bay, and Strawberry Hill, near Yachats, are among the largest collections of tidepools and are popular places for exploring them.

Also common along the coast are kelp forests and rock reefs. Both areas harbor much of Oregon&#x27;s marine life, including many species of fish, such as the numerous species of rockfish, flatfish, and greenlings. Because these areas provide a shelter from oceanic currents, these zones share many invertebrate species with the onshore tidal zone. Because of the rich diversity of life, most animal species along the Oregon coast depend on these keystone zones for survival.

===Coastal birds===

Many varieties of birds make their home on the Oregon Coast. Because of the variety of birds found in the area, bird watching is a common pastime. Birds along the Oregon Coast can be divided into four categories:
* Seabirds spend most of their lives at sea and are adapted to ocean life. Some even sleep in the water, though they must all return to land to lay their eggs. Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the common murre, tufted puffin, marbled murrelet, the black oystercatcher, auklets, many varieties of cormorants, the western gull, and glaucous-winged gull. 
* Shorebirds, unlike seabirds, do not have webbed feet and spend their lives on the shore foraging for food, eating worms, insect larvae, amphipods, copepods, crustaceans, and mollusks. Among the types of shorebirds on the Coast are the western and least sandpiper, dunlin, whimbrel, the semipalmated and western snowy plover, and killdeer.
* Many birds of prey live on the coast, eating small birds, rodents, and small mammals. These include the bald eagle, barn owl, and osprey.
* Waterfowl also make their homes in the freshwater areas around the Coast. These are the many varieties of ducks and geese in the area.

===Sharks===

The Oregon coastal waters are known to have 16 species of shark present:
* Basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus)
* Blue shark (Prionace glauca)
* Broadnose sevengill shark
* Brown catshark (Apristurus brunneus)
* Brown smooth-hound shark (Mustelus henlei) south coast only
* Common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus)
* Filetail catshark (Parmaturus xaniurus) central and south coast only
* Leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata)
* Longnose catshark (Apristurus kampae) south coast only
* Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica)
* Salmon shark (Lamna ditropis)
* Shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus)
* Soupfin shark (Galeorhinus galeus)
* Spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias)
* Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)
* White shark (Carcharodon carcharias)

There are one or two shark bites reported along the Oregon coast each year, mostly boats and surfing boards being tasted. Every few years—a total of 25 since 1900—a human is bitten. Every Oregon victim has survived. The last was Joseph Tanner, October 10, 2016.

==History==

It is generally accepted that the first indigenous peoples arrived in the region around 11,000–13,000 years ago, likely drawn by the rich natural resources of the area. However, very little is known about these early peoples, as very few archeological sites exist from before 3,500 years ago. Several tribes and language families would eventually form along the coast. Major groups included the Clatsop, Tillamook, Alsea, Siuslaw, Coos, and Coquille. The lifestyles of these tribes were very similar and sometimes interlinked, with the defining differences being the languages they spoke. Because of the abundance of food in the region, most settlements were permanent. Many of the tribes subsisted primarily on seafoods such as clams, salmon, and seals, as well as berries.

===European exploration (1775–1811)===
European exploration of the Oregon Coast began in the 18th century as Spanish mariners sailed northward from Mexico to explore and later stake claim to the region, led by explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa&#x27;s claim of the entire Pacific and shores in the name of the Spanish Crown. The earliest expedition recorded along the Pacific Northwest coast, however, was led by Spaniard Juan José Pérez Hernández aboard the sloop &quot;Santiago&quot; in 1774. Pérez&#x27;s findings were kept a secret and much of the credit for his findings went to later explorers. Pérez&#x27;s expedition was followed soon after by the 1775 expedition led by Bruno de Heceta and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, in which Pérez served as pilot. These further explorations led to many discoveries along the Oregon and Washington Coasts. Heceta Head was later named after Bruno de Heceta.

At the same time as the Spanish expeditions, British mariners also began to explore the region, led by explorers Sir Francis Drake in the 16th century and later by James Cook and George Vancouver in the 18th century. British expeditions made many discoveries in the region. Drake called the area New Albion, though the exact location of New Albion remains a mystery. Vancouver would make the most extensive explorations of the region during his expeditions.

Meanwhile, American Captain Robert Gray, aboard the sloop &quot;Washington&quot;, visited the Oregon Coast in his 1788 voyage to the west coast of the Americas. In August, 1788, Gray attempted to gain entrance to the mouth of the Columbia. However, Gray accidentally grounded the &quot;Washington&quot; on a sand bar, and the ship was attacked by natives, in which one crew member was killed and the mate wounded. Gray returned in 1792 aboard the &quot;Columbia&quot;, where he met with British Captain Vancouver off the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Gray mentioned the river to Vancouver, which Gray had named the Columbia. Vancouver quietly dismissed this claim by Gray, thinking that the Columbia was a part of the Juan de Fuca Strait. Vancouver was loath to later admit Gray&#x27;s correct discovery of the Columbia River.

====Lewis and Clark Expedition====

In 1803, with the successful purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France, President Thomas Jefferson ordered an expedition to the west coast, which was led by Captain Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. The Lewis and Clark Expedition reached the Oregon Coast in early winter of 1805, where they built Fort Clatsop near present-day Astoria. During their stay at Fort Clatsop, the Corps of Discovery made many observations about the landscape and local life, as well as establishing relations with the local Clatsop Indians. The expedition began their return trip to Washington D.C. in March 1806. The Lewis and Clark Expedition would have long-lasting effects for the Pacific Northwest and began the settlement of the U.S. west coast, even though heavy settlement of the Oregon Coast would not come until half a century later.

===Pioneer settlement (1811–1859)===
A few years later, in 1811, employees of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company set up a trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River and set up the first permanent U.S. settlement – Astoria. However, the settlement was not as profitable as Astor had hoped it would be. It was sold to the British North West Company in 1812 and became part of its Columbia District. In 1838, Charles Wilkes, on a voyage commissioned by U.S. Congress, landed on the Oregon Coast and raised the American flag. British claims were slowly lost with the increasing number of pioneers traveling to Oregon along the Oregon Trail, and 8 years later, the Oregon Treaty was signed with Britain, ending the half-century claims to Oregon and the Oregon Coast by the British.

===1860–present===
After Oregon attained statehood in 1859 and the completion of railroads throughout the Coast Range, development of land quickly began along many of the Coasts bays and rivers. Logging and commercial fishing soon became the primary industries in the area, and several ports were built to facilitate both industries. In 1870, the first lighthouse at Cape Blanco was built and was soon followed by both the Yaquina Bay Light and Yaquina Head Light in 1871 and 1873, respectively. The last Coast Guard operated light, Cape Arago Light, was built in 1934.

However, in 1874, Oregon State Land Board began to sell public tidelands to private landowners. Soon, resorts were built alongside the beaches in towns such as Seaside, Newport, and Rockaway Beach. The completion of railroads from the primary population centers in the Willamette Valley, the beginnings of tourism started along the coast.

In 1911, governor Oswald West was elected on the promise to reclaim Oregon&#x27;s beaches as public land. Though the legislature favored the privatization of these lands, West was able to make an argument for public ownership based on the need for transportation, and in 1913, the Oregon legislature declared the entire length of the ocean shore from the Columbia to California as a state highway. Legislators also created the State Highway Commission, which began the construction of U.S. Route 101 along the coast. The Parks and Recreation Department, a branch of the highway commission, bought land for 36 state parks along the coastal highway, an average of one every . With the completion of the highway-and-parks system, coastal tourism skyrocketed. Recent years have seen a drop in both the logging and fishing industries, due mainly to changes in the U.S. economy as well as changes in regulations governing the harvest of fish and timber.

====1967 Oregon Beach Bill====

Oregon&#x27;s public lands claim was challenged in 1966, when a motel owner fenced off beach area for the private use of his guests. Responding to citizen complaints, state legislators put forward the Oregon Beach Bill, proposing to reestablish the beaches&#x27; status as public land. Concerns about private property rights threatened the bill&#x27;s passage. In response, Governor Tom McCall staged a dramatic media event on May 13, 1967, flying two helicopters to the beach with a team of surveyors and scientists. The ensuing media coverage resulted in overwhelming public demand for the bill, which passed and was signed by McCall on July 6, 1967.

The Beach Bill declares that all &quot;wet sand&quot; within vertical feet of the low tide line belongs to the state of Oregon. In addition, it recognizes public easements of all beach areas up to the line of vegetation, regardless of underlying property rights. The public has &quot;free and uninterrupted use of the beaches,&quot; and property owners are required to seek state permits for building and other uses of the ocean shore. While some parts of the beach remain privately owned, state and federal courts have upheld Oregon&#x27;s right to regulate development of those lands and preserve public access.

==Tourism==
Due to its scenery, wildlife, and history, the Oregon Coast is a popular travel destination. Hiking, sport fishing, cycling, kite flying, scuba diving, surfing, sandboarding, and boating are common activities for visitors to the region. Historic areas, such as Fort Clatsop, Battle Rock, and Oregon&#x27;s lighthouses are all popular sites for visitors. The Oregon Coast is also known for its scenic areas, such as Cape Perpetua, Cape Blanco and Cape Arago. Likewise, each region has its own distinct draws in addition to those found throughout the state, such as the Astoria Column in Astoria, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, and Mount Emily outside Brookings. The South Coast&#x27;s commercial airport is the Southwest Oregon Regional Airport in North Bend and the Central Coast is served by the Newport Municipal Airport.

===Beaches===
Oregon&#x27;s beaches are popular destinations for visitors. Horse riding, clam digging, and surfing are popular activities. Certain beaches are host to events such as Seaside&#x27;s Beach Volleyball Tournament and finish for the Hood to Coast race or Lincoln City&#x27;s glass float hunt. Because of many headlands along the Oregon Coast, beaches vary in length from dozens of miles to less than a quarter of a mile. Though less common, surf fishing also occurs along sections of the beach. However, not all Oregon beaches are sand beaches. Large surf-smoothed stones are common and several stone beaches exist. Some beaches are also shrinking, due partially to human interactions and partly to invasive species of plant such as European Beachgrass.

===Lighthouses===

Another popular destination for visitors is Oregon&#x27;s historic lighthouses, most of which date to before 1900. Because the Oregon and Washington coasts have been traditionally thought of as some of the most dangerous seas in the world, several lighthouses and a lightship were commissioned to aid sailors in navigating. Of the original 12 lights, nine are still in use. However, in recent years, two private lights, Pelican Bay Light and Cleft of the Rock Light have been built, with permission from the Coast Guard. Both lights, along with Cape Arago Light, are private property.

===Outdoor activities===
The Oregon Coast is also host to many recreational activities. Hiking, camping, sport fishing, and cycling are the most common activities and are ubiquitous to the Oregon Coast. Sport fishing has traditionally been the primary outdoor recreational activity along the Oregon Coast, and is a major industry in several of Oregon&#x27;s port cities, especially Astoria, Newport, and Coos Bay. Because of this, Oregon has strict regulations concerning the harvest of fish for sport. Charter boats usually take groups out for half day and full day fishing trips for Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and Pacific halibut.

However, several other activities, many of which are more local than others, take place throughout the coast region of the state, several of which occur in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Most common are All-terrain vehicles and sandboarding. Many equipment rental and specialty shops exist to cater to these activities. Horse riding is also a common pastime along many beaches and dunes along the coast, and several horse trails exist in the nearby forests.

Surfing and bodyboarding are also common sports along the beaches of the Oregon Coast. Both occur nearly year-round, regardless of weather or water temperature.

The coast is home to several excellent golf courses. Among them is the Bandon Dunes ranked by Golf Digest as the 6th best public golf course in the U.S in 2015/2016, up from 7th in 2009

===Historic sites===

Many historical sites dot the Oregon Coast. The most prominent is that of Fort Clatsop outside of Astoria, which was the site of the Lewis and Clark Expeditions winter stay on the Oregon Coast in 1805–1806, as well as the nearby Peter Iredale which was grounded on the Clatsop Spit 100 years later in September 1906. However, over years of deterioration have destroyed much of the original ship. Now only a small portion remains above the sand. Both are part of the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park along with Fort Stevens.

Further south outside Tillamook sits the Tillamook Air Museum, which is housed in one of the two former military blimp hangars of the former Naval Air Station Tillamook. The structure was originally known as &quot;Hangar B&quot; and was part of a pair of hangars built by the U.S. Navy in 1942. &quot;Hangar A&quot; was destroyed by a fire in 1992. However, the concrete pilings that held the massive hangar doors erect still stand.

Along the coast just south of Cape Arago are several parks that were formerly the location of early homesteaders, as well as the former Seven Devil&#x27;s Trail. The homesteaders eventually abandoned their claims in favor of living closer to the nearby rural villages and towns. Today, nothing remains of these small farms and ranches, though several state parks mark their locations. However, south at Cape Blanco sits the Patrick Hughes House. The Hughes House is now a part of Cape Blanco State Park.
Located in Port Orford just south of Cape Blanco is the famous Battle Rock, which was the site of a major battle between local natives and members of an 1851 expedition led by Captain William Tichenor in order to begin railroad construction. Today, visitors can climb Battle Rock, though this is discouraged as frequent climbing has begun to erode the sandstone seastack. Also in Port Orford is the Port Orford Heads State Park, which is the location of the original Coast Guard lifeboat station. The station is now a museum for the historic station and maritime history, including the 1942 Lookout Air Raid.

Finally, Oregon has the distinction of being the only U.S. state (Hawaii and Alaska did not attain statehood until 1959) to receive hostile action during World War II, being both shelled and bombed.

The first attack, which took place the night of June 21, 1942, occurred at Fort Stevens when a Japanese submarine &quot;I-25&quot; surfaced offshore, and fired 17 rounds at the fort. However, Fort Stevens took no damage in the attack. The second attack took place two and a half months later when the I-25 surfaced off Cape Blanco, the night of September 9, 1942. Launching a small &quot;Glen&quot; seaplane, and using the Cape Blanco Light as a guide, pilot Nobuo Fujita and copilot Okuda Shoji dropped a series of incendiary bombs in the forests at Mount Emily with the intention of starting several forest fires in the area. Though the fires did not become the major infernos that the Japanese intended, the bomb site is now on the National Register of Historic Places as the &quot;Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site&quot;. Fujita returned in 1962 and gave his family&#x27;s 400-year-old sword to the city of Brookings. He was made an honorary citizen of Brookings days before his death in September 1997. His sword is now on display at the Brookings Public Library.

==Economy==
The coast is Oregon&#x27;s top tourist destination. In the mid-1980s, the coast&#x27;s economy was dependent on natural resources. Limits placed on logging and fishing caused further decline. As of the late 2000s, tourism and retirement have provided economic growth. As of 2006, roughly 210,000 people live on the Oregon Coast. The economy is still dependent on natural resources, but the largest contributions to personal income are retirement based and &quot;unidentified&quot;. The top three industries are timber, fishing, and tourism. The coast is poorer than the state average, with average income per capita $24,112 vs. $32,812.

<text>A bandleader is the leader of a music group such as a dance band, rock or pop band or jazz quartet. The term is most commonly used with a group that plays popular music as a small combo or a big band, such as one which plays jazz, blues, rhythm and blues or rock and roll music. Most bandleaders are also performers with their own band, either as singers or as instrumentalists, playing an instrument such as electric guitar, piano, or other instruments.

==Roles==
The bandleader must have a variety of musical skills. A bandleader needs to be a music director who chooses the &quot;setlist&quot; (the list of songs that will be played in a show), sets the tempo for each song and starts each song (often by &quot;counting in&quot;), leads the start of new sections of songs (e.g., signalling for the start of a guitar solo or drum solo) and leads the endings of each song. The bandleader is also onstage with the group, so they have to be a strong performer on lead vocals or an instrument. The bandleader also needs to have a good general knowledge of the different parts played by all the rhythm section instruments (guitar, keyboards, electric bass, drum kit) and solo instruments (e.g., lead guitar, saxophone, etc.), as they have to audition prospective new members of the band and lead rehearsals. The bandleader also typically selects new songs for the group, particularly if the group is a cover band or a tribute band. In some cases, the bandleader may manage other aspects of the band, such as organizing tours and sound recording sessions. Some bandleaders are also composers and songwriters for their group.

Often the bands are named after their bandleaders, or the backing band is given its own name, distinct from the bandleader (e.g., Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band or Elvis Costello and The Attractions). Some older bands such as The Count Basie Orchestra have continued operating under their bandleaders&#x27; names long after the death of the original bandleader.

<text>A scrummage, commonly known simply as a scrum, is a method of restarting play in rugby football that involves players packing closely together with their heads down and attempting to gain possession of the ball. Depending on whether it is in rugby union or rugby league, the scrum is used either after an accidental infringement or when the ball has gone out of play. Scrums occur more often, and are now of greater importance, in union than in league. Starting play from the line of scrimmage in gridiron football is derived from the scrum.

In both forms of rugby, a scrum is formed by the players who are designated forwards binding together in three rows. The scrum then &#x27;engages&#x27; with the opposition team so that the players&#x27; heads are interlocked with those of the other side&#x27;s front row. In rugby union the initiation of the process is verbally coordinated by the referee who calls &#x27;crouch, bind, set&#x27; as of 2013 (formerly &#x27;crouch, touch, pause, engage&#x27;, &#x27;crouch and hold, engage&#x27; before 2007). The scrum-half from the team that did not infringe then throws the ball into the tunnel created in the space between the two sets of front rowers&#x27; legs. Both teams may then try to compete for the ball by trying to hook the ball backwards with their feet.

A key difference between the two sports is that in rugby union both sets of forwards try to push the opposition backwards while competing for the ball and thus the team that did not throw the ball into the scrum has some minimal chance of winning the possession. In practice, however, the team with the &#x27;put-in&#x27; usually keeps possession (92% of the time with the feed) and put-ins are not straight. Forwards in rugby league do not usually push in the scrum, scrum-halves often feed the ball directly under the legs of their own front row rather than into the tunnel, and the team with the put-in usually retains possession (thereby making the 40/20 rule workable).

==Rugby union==
A rugby union scrum consists of two teams&#x27; eight forwards, with each team binding in three rows. The front row is composed of the two &quot;props&quot; and the &quot;hooker&quot;. The two &quot;second row&quot; forwards (jersey numbers four and five), commonly referred to as the locks bind together and directly behind the front row with each putting their heads between the props and the hooker. Lastly the back row is made up of the two &quot;flankers&quot; and the number eight. The flankers bind on each side of the scrum — next to a lock and behind a prop.
The two forward packs form a scrum by approaching to within an arms length of each other. The referee gives the command &quot;crouch&quot; and the opposing front rows then crouch; as well as allowing the front rows to interlock with one another, this crouching action also serves to isometrically preload the muscles, enabling the subsequent drive to be performed more powerfully. The referee then calls &quot;bind&quot; and forwards grab the opposites shoulders. The referee then issues the &quot;set&quot; command which indicates that the two packs may come together. When this happens both front rows thrust forward with the tighthead props&#x27; heads going between the opposing hooker and loosehead prop. The scrum-half from the team that has possession then throws the ball in the gap formed between the two front rows. The two hookers (and sometimes the props) then compete for possession by trying to hook the ball backwards with their feet, while the entire pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards. The side that wins possession usually transfers the ball to the back of the scrum — which is done with their feet. Once at the back it is picked up either by the number 8, or by the scrum-half.

Starting with the 2012/2013 rugby season the International Rugby Board has issued trial law amendments, one of which affects the call sequence. The referee will continue to start with &quot;crouch&quot; and &quot;touch&quot;, but will now issue the command &quot;set&quot;, which replaces &quot;engage&quot; as the indication that the packs may push forward. &quot;Pause&quot; has been removed in order to speed up the scrum and to minimize resets due to collapsed scrums. The command to &quot;touch&quot; was not used before 2007. Instead, the referee called &quot;crouch and hold&quot;, at which time each pack crouched and held that position before the referee gave the command to &quot;engage&quot;. Starting in 2013/2014 &quot;touch&quot; has been replaced with &quot;bind&quot;.

There are a large number of rules regarding the specifics of what can and cannot be done during a scrum. Front rowers must engage square on, rather than &quot;bore&quot; in on an angle. Front-rowers are also banned from twisting their bodies, pulling opponents, or doing anything that might collapse the scrum. The back row must remain bound until the ball has left the scrum. For flankers, this means keeping one arm, up to the shoulder, in contact with the scrum. The scrum must be stable, stationary and parallel to the goal-lines when they &quot;feed&quot; the ball; otherwise a free kick is awarded to the non-offending team. By strict letter of the law, the ball must be fed into the middle of the tunnel with its major axis parallel to the ground and touchline; however this is becoming less strictly enforced as the photo in this article illustrates. The ball must be thrown in quickly and in a single movement — this means that a feed cannot be faked. Once the ball has left the hands of the scrum-half the scrum has begun.

===Rugby sevens===

Scrums in rugby union sevens consist only of what would be the &quot;front row&quot; in normal rugby union. They consist of three forwards on each side, plus a scrum half to feed in the ball.

==Rugby league==

A rugby league scrum is used to bring the ball back into play in situations where the ball has gone out of play over the touchline or a player has made a mistake, a knock-on or forward pass, except when that mistake has occurred on the last tackle of a set of six tackles. A scrum is also used in the rare event that the ball bursts or the referee interferes with the movement of the ball.

The scrum consists of six players from each team in a 321 formation. The scrum is usually formed by each team&#x27;s &quot;forwards&quot;, though any player can participate. The front row of the formation consists of the open-side prop (8), hooker (9) and blind-side prop (10). Behind the front row are the two second row forwards (11&amp;12), and then the loose forward (13) at the back.

The two &quot;packs&quot; of forwards form a scrum before the ball is put into the scrum. The scrum-half (7) (also known as the halfback) of the team that did not commit the forward pass, knock-on or cause the ball to go out of play over the touch line puts the ball into the scrum through the tunnel formed by the front rows of each set of forwards meeting. When the ball bursts or the referee interferes with the ball, the team that had possession at the time is the one to put the ball into the scrum. Both teams may attempt to secure the ball while it is in the scrum by &quot;hooking&quot; for it or by pushing their opponents off the ball. The ball can be brought back into open play by the scrum-half retrieving it from the rear of the scrum or by the loose forward picking it up after detaching from the scrum.

While restarting play, the scrum serves to keep the forwards in one area of the field for a time, thus creating more space for back play and special plays, an advantage to the side that wins the scrum. It is now uncommon for the team not awarded the scrum feed to win possession &quot;against the feed&quot;. Prior to 1983, the loose forward would often stand outside of the scrum, leaving a &quot;five-man scrum&quot;. In an effort to provide more space for backline play, scrum rules were changed so that in normal circumstances loose forwards must always bind into the scrum. However, if a player is sent off, five-man scrums may occur. In this situation, the rules mandate the numbers of players &quot;not&quot; bound into the scrum.

While the Laws of the Game continue to provide for competitive scrums, a convention exists that some scrum rules are not enforced. During the 1970s, scrum penalties for feeding the ball into the legs of the second row, packs moving off the &quot;mark&quot; or collapsing the scrum were seen as unattractive. The ability of teams to win a game purely on goals from scrum penalties was also seen as unfair. In an effort to improve this situation, changes to rules and their enforcement were made. The number of scrums was reduced with the introduction of the &quot;handover&quot; after a team has used a set of six tackles, the differential penalty, one which cannot be kicked at goal was brought in for offences at scrums and referees ceased enforcing some rules regarding feeding the ball into scrum. Aided by this change, it is common for professional teams not to fully contest scrums, according to their choice of tactics. This in turn has led to some criticism that the scrummage in rugby league no longer serves a useful purpose, and should be replaced with a tap penalty or play the ball.

<text>The computer desk and related ergonomic desk are furniture pieces designed to comfortably and aesthetically provide a working surface and house or conceal office equipment including computers, peripherals and cabling for office and home-office users.

==Computer desk==
The most common form of the computer desk is an ergonomic variant of the office desk, which has an adjustable &quot;&quot; and sufficient desktop space for handwriting. Provisions for a monitor shelf and holes for routing cables are integrated in the design, making it easier to connect the computer components together. The typical armoire desk provides space for a keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer and speakers. Cubicle desk designs for business and government workplaces include a range of shelves, trays and cable-routing holes for computer systems. In some computer desks, the cabling is affixed to the modesty panel at the back of the desk, to create a neater appearance.

There are a great variety of computer desk shapes and forms. Large multiple student computer desks configured in rows are designed to house dozens of computer systems while facilitating wiring, general maintenance, theft prevention and vandalism reduction. Small rolling lectern desks or computer carts with tiny desktops provide just enough room for a laptop computer and a mouse pad. Computer desks are typically mass-produced and require some self-assembly.

The computer itself is normally separate from the desk, which is designed to hold a typically sized computer, monitor and accessories. Cabling must be routed through the channels and access openings by the user or installer. A small number of computers are built within a desk made specially for them, like the British &quot;i-desk&quot;. Various proposals for the &quot;Office of the future&quot; suggested other integrated designs, but these have not been taken up.

A rolling chair table configuration offers mobility and improved access in situations where a desk is not convenient. computer tables can be used over a bed. Modular computer tables separate user interface elements from the computing and network connection, allowing more placement flexibility. The modules are connected via wireless technology.

==Ergonomic desk==
The ergonomic desk is a modern desk form which, like the adjustable drawing table or drafting table, offers mechanical adjustments for the placement of its elements in order to maximize user comfort and efficiency. The ergonomic desk is usually a &quot;stand-alone&quot; piece of furniture allowing access to the adjustment mechanisms. Some ergonomic desks have a sufficiently large desktop height adjustment to create either a common &quot;sit-down&quot; desk or a less common standing desk, which allows the user to work while standing. The ergonomic desk is usually a close companion to the ergonomic chair.

The ergonomic desk originated with the beginning of the field of human factors or ergonomics after World War II. Legislation stating minimal requirements for furniture used by office workers referred to ergonomic desk standards.

The desk area should be deep enough to accommodate a monitor placed at least 20 inches away from your eyes.

==Health and safety==

Some research has indicated that the placement of computer desks in an office environment can influence workers&#x27; happiness and productivity. Having an appropriate chair increases comfort and can reduce work-related injuries and pain.

<doc id="445406" wikidata="Q1093731" url="?curid=445406" title="Daqing Oil Field">
<text>The Daqing Oil Field (), formerly romanized as &quot;Taching&quot;, is the largest oil field in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, located between the Songhua river and Nen River in Heilongjiang province. When the Chinese government began to use pinyin for romanization, the field&#x27;s name became known as Daqing.

It is the largest oil deposit discovered in China and its ability to support China&#x27;s industrialization changed the country&#x27;s developmental path. Daqing oil field contained or 2.2 billion tons in the beginning and has produced over of oil since production started in 1960; the remaining recoverable reserves are about or 500 million tons.

==History==
Daqing oil field is located in the Songliao Basin, a large sedimentary basin that is in the tectonic framework of the North China-Mongolia tract. 

In 1959, the oil field was discovered by Li Siguang. Iron Man Wang Jinxi (who led No. 1205 drilling team) worked on this oilfield. The first oil well was drilled on September 26, 1959. Because the success occurred four days before the tenth anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the field was named Daqing, meaning &quot;great celebration.&quot; The discovery of the oil field made the Manchuria region a national center for the oil industry. 

During its 1960 construction during the Great Leap Forward, Oil Minister Yu Qiuli mobilized workers building the Daqing oil field through ideological motivation instead of material incentives, focusing enthusiasm, energy, and resources to complete a rapid industrialization project. The successful construction of the Daqing oil field despite harsh weather conditions and supply limitations became a model held up by the Communist Party as an example during subsequent industrialization campaigns. 

In April 1960, Yu stated that Mao Zedong&#x27;s texts &quot;On Practice&quot; and &quot;On Contradiction&quot; should be the ideological core of the Daqing oil field campaign. The Ministry of the Petroleum Industry shipped thousands of copies by plane so that every Daqing oil worker would have copies and for work units to each set up their own study groups. 

Daqing oil field was a secret until 1964. On February 5, 1964, the central Party promoted Daqing oil field to other industrial enterprises, instructing them to follow the &quot;all-out battle&quot; tactics of Daqing oil field. Shortly afterwards, Mao Zedong praised the Daqing oil field at an education work conference, stating that with a &quot;little investment&quot; in a &quot;short period of time&quot; a &quot;great achievement&quot; had been finished. &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and other state media published numerous articles on Daqing in 1964, extolling the self-discipline of Daqing workers, their study of Mao Zedong thought, and the technical achievements resulting from the democratic participation of workers. Most significant among these articles was the April 20, 1964 piece &quot;Daqing People, Daqing Spirit&quot; which &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published. The article compared Daqing to Yan&#x27;an, the base area where the Communist Party regrouped after the Long March.

The field was financed through commodity-backed loans that China obtained from Japan. China repaid these loans with oil. 

The project delivered critical economic benefits because without the production of the Daqing oil field, crude oil would have been severely limited after the Soviet Union cut off supplies as a result of the Sino-Soviet split. 

The first two years of the Cultural Revolution resulted in major disruptions to China&#x27;s petroleum industry and an oil shortage by 1967. In March of that year, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was called to Daqing to maintain order so that oil production could proceed. This made Daqing one of the first places brought under military control during the Cultural Revolution. In May 1968, the Daqing Revolutionary Committee was established. Iron Man Wang became its vice director. The Daqing Oil Field was among 2,400 central state-owned enterprises transferred to local government control in 1970. The Daqing oil field continued to be a major driver of economic growth through during the chaotic Cultural Revolution era. 

During the period 1964 to 1980, the oil field accounted for more than half of China&#x27;s crude oil production per year. In 1966, crude oil production in Daqing reached 10 million metric tons and the number of workers at Daqing reached 58,000. 

In the mid 1980s, the oil field generated 3% of China&#x27;s state revenue through a combination of the profits and tax payments it supplied.

As of 2013 the field&#x27;s production rate was about .

Daqing Oilfield Company Limited, based in Daqing, is the operator of exploration and development of Daqing Oilfield. From 2004, the company plans to cut its crude oil output by an annual 7% for the next seven years to extend the life of Daqing.

Output of barrels of oil equivalent of the Daqing Field remained stable at over 40 million tons in 2012, while output at Changqing oil field was over 42 million tons, making it the most productive oil and gas field in China.

Crude output from the ageing Daqing oilfield is in decline even though the CNPC deployed some non-traditional drilling techniques. In 2019, output fell to 30.9 million tonnes from 32 million tonnes in 2018. At its peak in 2008, output stood at 40 million tonnes a year.
The production was 30 million tonnes in 2021. 

A new shale oil field was discovered in Daqing Oilfield in 2021, with an estimated geological reserve of 1.268 billion tons.

== Ideological significance ==
The Chinese government promoted the success of the Daqing oilfield and the selflessness of workers who built it as part of the face of new the socialist industrial person that China sought to encourage in the 1960s and 1970s. The Chinese press urged industrial workers to follow the model of ascetic living practiced by workers on the Daqing oilfield in order to advance China&#x27;s development of socialist modernity. Recruitment events for the Third Front construction, a massive campaign to develop basic industry and national defense industry in China&#x27;s interior in case of invasion by the United States or the Soviet Union, urged prospective Third Front workers to learn from the Daqing oil field and &quot;use revolutionary spirit to avoid all difficulties.&quot; During the Third Front, the model of the Daqing oilfield went from being a slogan to a fundamental principle behind the centrally directed and militarized industrialization campaign.

&quot;Iron Man&quot; Wang Jinxi was the most significant model worker in Daqing oil field, and remains one of the most celebrated working class models in China. An experienced oil worker from the Yumen Oil Field, Wang was one of the first oil workers to arrive to work the Daqing field in Saertu. At Daqing, Wang was one of the first model workers selected by Yu Qiuli due to Wang&#x27;s devotion to the oil production industry and to competitive work.

== Administration ==
The Daqing Oil Field Management Bureau and PetroChina Daqing Company are located in West Town in Daqing.

==In popular culture==
In 1964, chief director of the Central Experimental Theater Sun Weishi and her husband, the actor Jin Shan, traveled to Daqing to live and work with the oil workers and their families. The next year, the Communist Party journal &quot;Red Flag&quot; published an article by Sun which praised the Daqing people. After living in Daqing for two years, Sun Weishi returned to Beijing to produce the play &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;, which was based on the experiences of people in Daqing, particularly Daqing women.

It is featured as a map in first-person shooter video game &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;.

It was also featured in a dedicated part of the &quot;How Yukong Moved the Mountains&quot; documentary, &quot;About Petroleum&quot;.

<doc id="445407" wikidata="Q331377" url="?curid=445407" title="Bleeding Kansas">
<text>Bleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas, or the Border War, was a series of violent civil confrontations in Kansas Territory, and to a lesser extent in western Missouri, between 1854 and 1859. It emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas.

The conflict was characterized by years of electoral fraud, raids, assaults, and murders carried out in the Kansas Territory and neighboring Missouri by proslavery &quot;border ruffians&quot; and retaliatory raids carried out by antislavery &quot;free-staters&quot;. According to &quot;Kansapedia&quot; of the Kansas Historical Society, 56 political killings were documented during the period, and the total may be as high as 200. It has been called a Tragic Prelude, or an overture, to the American Civil War, which immediately followed it.

The conflict centered on the question of whether Kansas, upon gaining statehood, would join the Union as a slave state or a free state. The question was of national importance because Kansas&#x27;s two new senators would affect the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, which was bitterly divided over the issue of slavery. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 called for popular sovereignty: the decision about slavery would be made by popular vote of the territory&#x27;s settlers rather than by legislators in Washington, D.C. Existing sectional tensions surrounding slavery quickly found focus in Kansas.

Missouri, a slave state since 1821, was populated by many settlers with Southern sympathies and pro-slavery views, some of whom tried to influence the Kansas decision by entering Kansas and claiming to be residents. The conflict was fought politically, and between civilians, where it eventually degenerated into brutal gang violence and paramilitary guerrilla warfare.

Kansas had a state-level civil war that would soon be replicated on a national basis. It had two different capitals (proslavery Lecompton and antislavery Lawrence, then Topeka), two different constitutions (the proslavery Lecompton Constitution and the antislavery Topeka Constitution), and two different legislatures (the so-called &quot;bogus legislature&quot; in Lecompton and the antislavery body in Lawrence). Both sides sought and received help from outside, the proslavery side from the federal government: Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan openly helped the proslavery partisans. Both claimed to reflect the will of the people of Kansas. The proslavers used violence and threats of violence, and the free-soilers responded in kind. After much commotion, including a congressional investigation, it became clear that a majority of Kansans wanted Kansas to be a free state, but this required congressional approval, which Southerners in Congress blocked.

Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state the same day that enough Southern senators had departed, during the secession crisis that led to the Civil War, to allow it to pass (effective January 29, 1861). Partisan violence continued along the Kansas–Missouri border for most of the war, although Union control of Kansas was never seriously threatened. Bleeding Kansas demonstrated that armed conflict over slavery was unavoidable. Its severity made national headlines, which suggested to the American people that the sectional disputes were unlikely to be resolved without bloodshed, and it, therefore, acted as a preface to the American Civil War. The episode is commemorated with numerous memorials and historic sites.

==Origins==

As abolitionism became increasingly popular in the United States and tensions between its supporters and detractors grew, the U.S. Congress maintained a tenuous balance of political power between Northern and Southern representatives. At the same time, the increasing emigration of Americans to the country&#x27;s western frontier and the desire to build a transcontinental railroad that would connect the eastern states with California urged incorporation of the western territories into the Union. The inevitable question was how these territories would treat the issue of slavery when eventually promoted to statehood. This question had already plagued Congress during political debates following the Mexican–American War. The Compromise of 1850 had at least temporarily solved the problem by permitting residents of the Utah and New Mexico Territories to decide their own laws with respect to slavery by popular vote, an act which set a new precedent in the ongoing debate over slavery.

In May 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act created from Indian lands the new territories of Kansas and Nebraska for settlement by U.S. citizens. The act was proposed by Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois as a way to appease Southern representatives in Congress, who had resisted earlier proposals to admit states from the Nebraska Territory because of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had explicitly forbidden the practice of slavery in all U.S. territory north of 36°30&#x27; latitude and west of the Mississippi River, except in the state of Missouri. Southerners feared the incorporation of Nebraska would upset the balance between slave and free states and thereby give abolitionist Northerners an advantage in Congress.

Douglas&#x27;s proposal attempted to allay these fears with the organization of two territories instead of one, and with the inclusion of a &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; clause that would, like the condition previously prescribed for Utah and New Mexico, permit settlers of Kansas and Nebraska to vote on the legality of slavery in their own territories—a notion which directly contradicted and effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise, as both Kansas and Nebraska were located entirely north of parallel 36°30&#x27; north and west of the Mississippi. Like many others in Congress, Douglas assumed that settlers of Nebraska would ultimately vote to prohibit slavery and that settlers of Kansas, further south and closer to the slave state of Missouri, would vote to allow it, and thereby the balance of slave and free states would not change. Regarding Nebraska, this assumption was correct; the idea of slavery had little appeal for Nebraska&#x27;s residents and its fate as a free state was already solidly in place. In Kansas, however, the assumption of legal slavery underestimated abolitionist resistance to the repeal of the long-standing Missouri Compromise. Southerners saw the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act as an emboldening victory; Northerners considered it an outrageous defeat. Each side of the slavery question saw a chance to assert itself in Kansas, and it quickly became the nation&#x27;s prevailing ideological battleground, and the most violent place in the country.

The term &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; was popularized by Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s first reference to &quot;Kansas, bleeding&quot;, came on June 16, 1856, in a report on the North American National Convention. There, a Colonel Perry of Kansas reported that &quot;Kansas, bleeding at every pore, would cast more votes indirectly for [the presidential candidate the convention settled upon] ... than any other State in the Union.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s first mention of &quot;bleeding Kansas&quot; is in a poem by Charles S. Weyman, published on September 13, 1856:

===Early elections===
Immediately, immigrants supporting both sides of the slavery question arrived in the Kansas Territory to establish residency and gain the right to vote. Among the first settlers of Kansas were citizens of slave states, especially nearby Missouri, many of whom strongly supported Southern ideologies and emigrated to Kansas specifically to assist the expansion of slavery. Proslavery immigrants settled towns, including Leavenworth and Atchison. The administration of President Franklin Pierce appointed territorial officials in Kansas aligned with its own proslavery views, and heeding rumors that the frontier was being overwhelmed by Northerners, thousands of nonresident slavery proponents soon entered Kansas with the goal of influencing local politics. Proslavery factions thereby captured many early territorial elections, often by fraud and intimidation. In November 1854, thousands of armed proslavery men known as &quot;Border Ruffians&quot; or &quot;Southern Yankees&quot;, mostly from Missouri, poured into the Kansas Territory and swayed the vote in the election for a nonvoting delegate to Congress in favor of proslavery Democratic candidate John Wilkins Whitfield. The following year, a congressional committee investigating the election reported that 1,729 fraudulent votes were cast compared to 1,114 legal votes. In one location, only 20 of the 604 voters were residents of the Kansas Territory; in another, 35 were residents and 226 nonresidents.

At the same time, Northern abolitionists encouraged their own supporters to move to Kansas in the effort to make the territory a free state, hoping to flood Kansas with so-called &quot;Free-Soilers&quot; or &quot;Free-Staters&quot;. By far the most famous of these, and their leader, was John Brown of Leavenworth, who moved from Ohio. Many citizens of Northern states arrived with assistance from benevolent societies such as the Boston-based New England Emigrant Aid Company, founded shortly before passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act with the specific goal of assisting anti-slavery immigrants to reach Kansas Territory. In a colorful story that may be legend, the abolitionist minister Henry Ward Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s brother, shipped them Sharps rifles in crates labelled &quot;Bibles&quot;; they became known as Beecher&#x27;s Bibles. Despite boasts that 20,000 New England Yankees would be sent to the Kansas Territory, only about 1,200 settlers had emigrated there by the end of 1855. Nevertheless, aid movements like these, heavily publicized by the Eastern press, played a significant role in creating the nationwide hysteria over the fate of Kansas, and were directly responsible for the establishment of towns which later became strongholds of Republican and abolitionist sentiment, including Lawrence, Topeka, and Manhattan, Kansas.

===First Territorial Legislature===
On March 30, 1855, the Kansas Territory held the election for its first territorial legislature. Crucially, this legislature would decide whether the territory would allow slavery. Just as had happened in the election of November 1854, &quot;Border Ruffians&quot; from Missouri again streamed into the territory to vote, and proslavery delegates were elected to 37 of the 39 seats—Martin F. Conway and Samuel D. Houston from Riley County were the only Free-Staters elected. Free-Staters loudly denounced the elections as fraudulent. Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder pleased neither side when he invalidated, as tainted by fraud, the results in only 11 of the 40 legislative races. A special election was held on May 22 to elect replacements, and the results were dramatically different; eight of the 11 delegates elected in the special election were Free-Staters. This still left the proslavery camp with an overwhelming 29–10 advantage.

The proslavery legislature convened in the newly created territorial capital of Pawnee on July 2, 1855. The legislature immediately invalidated the results from the special election in May and seated the proslavery delegates elected in March. After only one week in Pawnee, the legislature moved the territorial capital to the Shawnee Mission, on the border with Missouri, where it reconvened, adopted a slave code for Kansas modeled largely on that of Missouri, and began passing laws favorable to slaveholders.

Free-Staters quickly elected delegates to a separate legislature based in Topeka, which proclaimed itself the legitimate government and called the proslavery government operating in Lecompton &quot;bogus&quot;. This body created the first territorial constitution, the Topeka Constitution. Charles L. Robinson, a Massachusetts native and agent of the New England Emigrant Aid Company, was elected territorial governor.

Reeder had not been elected but appointed by President Pierce, at whose pleasure he served. Pierce fired him on August 16, 1855, replacing him with the very pro-Southern Wilson Shannon. Reeder left the territory and found it prudent to do so in disguise.

Pierce refused to recognize the Free-State legislature. In a message to Congress on January 24, 1856, Pierce declared the Topeka government &quot;insurrectionist&quot;. The presence of dual governments was symptomatic of the strife brewing in the territory and further provoked supporters of both sides of the conflict.

In response to the disputed votes and rising tension, Congress sent a three-man special committee to the Kansas Territory in 1856. The committee reported, in July 1856, that if the election of March 30, 1855, had been limited to &quot;actual settlers&quot;, it would have elected a Free-State legislature. The report also stated that the legislature actually seated in Lecompton &quot;was an illegally constituted body, and had no power to pass valid laws&quot;. In other words, the Free-Staters&#x27; allegations of fraud were well founded, and the Lecompton legislature was indeed bogus.

==Constitutional fight==

Much of the early confrontation of the Bleeding Kansas era centered formally on the creation of a constitution for the future state of Kansas. The first of four such documents was the Topeka Constitution, written by antislavery forces unified under the Free-Soil Party in December 1855. This constitution was the basis for the Free-State territorial government that resisted the federally authorized government, elected by Missourians who, congressional investigation soon revealed, committed fraud by voting in Kansas as residents and then returning to Missouri. On June 30, 1856, after Pierce&#x27;s declaration that the Topeka government was extralegal, Congress rejected ratification of the Topeka Constitution.

Pierce was succeeded in 1857 by James Buchanan. Like his predecessor, Buchanan was a Northerner sympathetic to the South and proslavery interests. That year, a second constitutional convention met in Lecompton, and by early November had drafted the Lecompton Constitution, a proslavery document endorsed by President Buchanan. The constitution was submitted to Kansans for a vote on a special slavery article, but Free-Staters refused to participate, since they knew that the constitution would allow Kansas slaveholders to keep existing slaves even if the article in question was voted against. The Lecompton Constitution, including the slavery article, was approved by a vote of 6,226 to 569 on December 21. Congress instead ordered another election because of voting irregularities uncovered. On August 2, 1858, Kansas voters rejected the document by 11,812 to 1,926.

While the Lecompton Constitution was pending before Congress, a third document, the Leavenworth Constitution, was written and passed by Free State delegates. It was more radical than other Free-State proposals in that it would have extended suffrage to &quot;every male citizen,&quot; regardless of race. Participation in this ballot on May 18, 1858, was a fraction of the previous and there was even some opposition by Free-State Democrats. The proposed constitution was forwarded to the U.S. Senate on January 6, 1859, where it was met with a tepid reception and left to die in committee.

The fourth and final Free State proposal was the Wyandotte Constitution, drafted in 1859, which represented the anti-slavery view of the future of Kansas. It was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530 on October 4, 1859. With Southern states still in control of the Senate, confirmation of the Wyandotte Constitution was indefinitely postponed. When senators from the seceding states left in January 1861, Kansas was immediately admitted—the same day—as a free state.

==Open violence==
On November 21, 1855, the so-called Wakarusa War began in Douglas County when a proslavery settler, Franklin Coleman, shot and killed a Free-Stater, Charles W. Dow, with whom Coleman had long been engaged in a feud that was unrelated to local or national politics. Dow was the first American settler to be murdered in the Kansas Territory. The decision by Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones to arrest another Free-Stater rather than Coleman and the prisoner&#x27;s subsequent rescue by a Free-State posse erupted into a conflict that pitted, for the first time, armed pro-slavery settlers against antislavery settlers. Governor Wilson Shannon called for the Kansas militia, but the assembled army was composed almost entirely of proslavery Missourians, who camped outside the town of Lawrence with stolen weapons and a cannon.

In response, Lawrence raised its own militia, led by Charles L. Robinson, the man elected governor by the Topeka legislature, and James H. Lane. The parties besieging Lawrence reluctantly dispersed only after Shannon negotiated a peace agreement between Robinson and Lane and David Rice Atchison. The conflict had one other fatality, when Free-Stater Thomas Barber was shot and killed near Lawrence on December 6.

===Summer of 1856===

On May 21, 1856, proslavery Democrats and Missourians invaded Lawrence, Kansas, and burned the Free State Hotel, destroyed two antislavery newspaper offices, and ransacked homes and stores in what became known as the Sacking of Lawrence. A cannon used during the Mexican–American War, called the Old Kickapoo or Kickapoo Cannon, was stolen and used on that day by a proslavery group including the Kickapoo Rangers of the Kansas Territorial Militia. It was later recovered by an anti-slavery faction and returned to the city of Leavenworth.
In May 1856, Republican Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts took to the floor to denounce the threat of slavery in Kansas and humiliate its supporters. Sumner accused Democrats in support of slavery of lying in bed with &quot;the harlot of slavery&quot; on the House floor during his &quot;Crimes Against Kansas&quot; speech. He had devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what Republicans called the slave power, that is the efforts of slave owners to control the federal government and ensure both the survival and the expansion of slavery. In the speech (called &quot;The Crime against Kansas&quot;) Sumner criticized South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler, portraying Butler&#x27;s pro-slavery agenda towards Kansas with the raping of a virgin, and characterizing his affection for it in sexual terms. Two days later, Butler&#x27;s cousin, the South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks, nearly killed Sumner on the Senate floor with a heavy cane. The action electrified the nation, brought violence to the floor of the Senate, and deepened the North–South split. After nearly killing Sumner, Brooks was praised by Southern Democrats for the attack. Many pro-slavery newspapers concluded that abolitionists in Kansas and beyond &quot;must be lashed into submission,&quot; and hundreds of Southern Democrat lawmakers after the attack sent Brooks new canes as an endorsement of the attack, with one of the canes being inscribed with the phrase &quot;hit him again.&quot; Towns and counties renamed themselves to honor Brooks (Brooksville, Florida, Brooks County, Georgia, and others). Two weeks after the attack, American philosopher and Harvard graduate Ralph Waldo Emerson condemned Brooks and the pro-slavery lawmakers, stating: &quot;I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom.&quot; In the coming weeks, many proslavery Democrats wore necklaces made from broken pieces of the cane as a symbol of solidarity with Preston Brooks.

The violence continued to increase. John Brown led his sons and other followers to plan the murder of settlers who spoke in favor of slavery. At a proslavery settlement at Pottawatomie Creek on the night of May 24, the group seized five proslavery men from their homes and hacked them to death with broadswords. Brown and his men escaped and began plotting a full-scale slave insurrection to take place at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, with financial support from Boston abolitionists.

The proslavery territorial government, serving under President Pierce, had been relocated to Lecompton. In April 1856, a congressional committee arrived there to investigate voting fraud. The committee found that non-Kansas residents had illegally voted in the election, resulting in the proslavery government. President Pierce refused recognition of its findings and continued to authorize the proslavery legislature, which the Free State people called the &quot;Bogus Legislature&quot;.
On July 4, 1856, proclamations of President Pierce led to nearly 500 U.S. Army troops arriving in Topeka from Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley. With their cannons pointed at Constitution Hall and the long fuses lit, Colonel E.V. Sumner, cousin to the senator of the same name who was beaten on the Senate floor, ordered the dispersal of the Free State Legislature.

In August 1856, thousands of proslavery men formed into armies and marched into Kansas. That month, Brown and several of his followers engaged 400 proslavery soldiers in the Battle of Osawatomie. The hostilities raged for another two months until Brown departed the Kansas Territory, and a new territorial governor, John W. Geary, took office and managed to prevail upon both sides for peace.

===1857–1861===

This was followed by a fragile peace broken by intermittent violent outbreaks for two more years. The last major outbreak of violence was touched off by the Marais des Cygnes massacre in 1858, in which Border Ruffians killed five Free State men. In the so-called Battle of the Spurs, in January 1859, John Brown led escaped slaves through a proslavery ambush en route to freedom via Nebraska and Iowa; not a shot was fired. About 56 people, though, died in Bleeding Kansas by the time the violence ended in 1859.

There were still ongoing acts of violence even after Kansas adopted a free state constitution in 1859. In 1860, the Indian agent Col. Cowan and sixty United States dragoons burned down many free state supporting settlers&#x27; homes, while sparing settlers who came from the South or supported slavery.

==Kansas admitted as a free state==

The congressional legislative deadlock was broken in early 1861, when following the election of Abraham Lincoln as President, seven Southern states seceded from the Union. Kansas&#x27;s entry as a free state had already been approved by the House of Representatives, but had been blocked by Southern senators. When, early in 1861, the senators of the seceding states withdrew from Congress or were expelled, Kansas was immediately, within days, admitted to the Union as a free state, under the Wyandotte Constitution. While pro-Confederates in Missouri attempted to effect that state&#x27;s secession from the Union, and succeeded in having a pro-Confederate government recognized by and admitted to the Confederacy, by the end of 1861, even that state was firmly in control of its Unionist government. Without control of Missouri, regular Confederate forces were never in a position to seriously threaten the newly recognized free state government in Kansas.

Nevertheless, following the commencement of the American Civil War in 1861, additional guerrilla violence erupted on the border between Kansas and Missouri and sporadically continued until the end of the war.

==Legacy==
===Heritage area===
In 2006, federal legislation defined a new Freedom&#x27;s Frontier National Heritage Area (FFNHA) and was approved by Congress. A task of the heritage area is to interpret Bleeding Kansas stories, which are also called stories of the Kansas–Missouri border war. A theme of the heritage area is the enduring struggle for freedom. FFNHA includes 41 counties, 29 of which are in eastern Kansas and 12 in western Missouri.

<text>The black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) is a wading bird of the heron family Ardeidae, common throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. It is mainly resident, but some west African birds move further north in the rainy season.

This species usually breeds in the wet season in colonies in trees, reedbeds or cliffs. It builds a bulky stick nest and lays 2–4 eggs.

It often feeds in shallow water, spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. It also hunts well away from water, taking large insects, small mammals, and birds. It waits motionless for its prey, or slowly stalk its victim.

The black-headed heron is a large bird, standing 85 cm tall, and it has a 150 cm wingspan. It is nearly as large as the grey heron, which it resembles in appearance, although it is generally darker. Its plumage is largely grey above, and paler grey below. It has a powerful dusky bill.

The flight is slow, with the neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, and spoonbills, which extend their necks. The white underwing coverts are striking in flight.

The call is a loud croaking.

<text>Janusz Żurakowski (12 September 1914 – 9 February 2004) was a Polish fighter and test pilot. At various times in his life he lived and worked in Poland, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
==Early life==
Żurakowski was born in 1914 to Polish parents in Ryżawka near Uman, which had been a village in the Russian Empire since 1793, when it was removed from Poland in the Second Partition. In 1921, following the Polish–Soviet War, the Treaty of Riga established the frontier between Soviet Russia and the Second Polish Republic. The new border placed Ryżawka in Soviet territory, so the Żurakowski family left their home and escaped into the newly established Polish Republic.

Żurakowski was educated at a high school in Lublin, where he learned to fly gliders. In 1934, he joined the Polish Air Force and entered the Polish Air Force Officers&#x27; School. After learning to fly powered aircraft, he graduated in 1935 as a sub-lieutenant. He went on to serve as a fighter pilot posted to 161 Fighter Squadron in Lwów, and in 1939 he served as a flying instructor at Dęblin.

==Second World War==
In September 1939, &quot;Black September&quot;, Żurakowski had his combat debut in an outmoded PZL P.7 trainer against a squadron of seven German Dornier Do 17s attacking Dęblin on 2 September. He was able to damage one of the Do 17s but was forced to break off combat when his guns jammed.

Following the defeat of Poland, Żurakowski made his way to England via Romania and France. Like many of his compatriots, he was smuggled out of the war zone with false documents and a new identity as a forester. Thousands of the Polish Air Force pilots who had made their way to France fought against Luftwaffe forces in the Battle of France. Żurakowski was originally posted to a fighter unit in France before he was selected to train as a bomber pilot in England. Once he arrived in England, the RAF changed its mind and sent him and the first group of Poles to fighter squadrons, which were rapidly being deployed in anticipation of an attack on Britain in 1940.

Żurakowski was first posted as a pilot officer to 152 Squadron before joining No. 234 Squadron initially stationed at RAF St Eval, Cornwall, a town named after the patron saint of flight testing. The squadron was moved forward to RAF Middle Wallop on 13 August 1940. He flew the Supermarine Spitfire Mk. 1 against the Luftwaffe, shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 over the Isle of Wight on 15 August 1940. After being shot down nine days later, he returned to duty, shooting down two Messerschmitt Bf 109Es on the 12th and 13th day after that. Near the conclusion of the Battle of Britain, he scored a &quot;probable&quot; over a Bf 110C on 29 September 1940. Following the decimation of 234 Squadron and its transfer to the north, Żurakowski asked for a transfer to No. 609 Squadron RAF, a Spitfire unit still in the front lines. From there he was reposted as a flight instructor to a succession of Flight Training Units, where he passed on his knowledge of combat flying to a new group of fighter pilots.
In 1942, now Flying Officer Żurakowski flew again with his countrymen on Spitfire IIs in No. 315 Squadron, rising to the post of squadron leader of No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron and deputy wing leader of Polish No. 1 Fighter Wing stationed at RAF Northolt. He often escorted USAAF bombers on daylight bombing raids. Żurakowski scored a probable over a Messerschmitt Bf 109G on 17 May 1943 while acting as the wing gunnery officer. He was awarded the Virtuti Militari, the Polish equivalent of the Victoria Cross in 1943. He also received the Polish Cross of Valour () and Bar (1941) and Second Bar (1943).

==Postwar==
After the war, Żurakowski, among many other Polish veterans, chose to stay in Britain. In 1944, he was posted to the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School, graduating from No. 2 Course on 5 January 1945. From 1945 to 1947, Żurakowski worked as a test pilot with &quot;C&quot; Squadron of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at RAF Boscombe Down, testing naval aircraft for the Air Ministry. Never having landed an aircraft on a carrier before, he practised landing on a deck painted on a runway at Naval Air Station East Haven. Following a brief training period, he proceeded to land the Supermarine Seafire, a navalised Spitfire, on the deck of HMS &quot;Ravager&quot; without incident. 

While still at Boscombe Down, Żurakowski flew over 30 different types of aircraft, including the Vampire, the de Havilland Hornet, and the Gloster Meteor. He never let pass &quot;an opportunity to give the staff a display that included single engine aerobatics&quot;. Acknowledged as one of the best aerobatic pilots in the UK, he gave a spectacular display at the Farnborough Airshow in June 1946 with the Martin-Baker MB 5, a piston-engined fighter designed too late to enter war production.

Retiring from the RAF as squadron leader in 1947, Żurakowski was employed as chief experimental test pilot for Gloster Aircraft Company under Chief Test Pilot Bill Waterton. When Waterton was in Canada on assignment, Żurakowski assumed the role of acting chief test pilot. Żurakowski tested the many experimental versions of the Gloster Meteor, Javelin, and Gloster E.1/44 fighters. He set an international speed record: London–Copenhagen–London, 4–5 April 1950. The attempt was organised by Gloster to sell the Meteor IV to the Danish Air Force, and it succeeded.

At the 1951 at Farnborough Airshow, Żurakowski demonstrated a new aerobatics manoeuvre, the &quot;Zurabatic cartwheel&quot;, in which he suspended the Gloster Meteor G-7-1 prototype he was flying in a vertical cartwheel. &quot;This jet manoeuvre was the first new aerobatic in 20 years.&quot; The cartwheel used the dangerously asymmetric behaviour the Meteor had with one engine throttled back. It started with a vertical climb to , by which point the aircraft had slowed to only . Cutting the power of one engine caused the Meteor to pivot. When the nose was pointing downwards, the second engine was throttled back. The aircraft continued to rotate through a further 360 degrees on momentum alone, having lost nearly all vertical velocity. Carrying out the cartwheel and recovering from it without entering an inverted spin (which the Meteor could not be brought out of) required great skill.

In April 1952, Żurakowski and his family left for Canada, where he became a test pilot for A.V. Roe Canada, concentrating on experimental testing. He broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952 as a first pilot in Canada, diving the CF-100 fighter, the first straight-winged jet aircraft to achieve this feat. While testing an experimental rocket pack on 23 August 1954, Zura survived an explosion that killed his observer, John Hiebert. 
During the Avro Canada years, Żurakowski continued to fly as an aerobatic display pilot with spectacular results. Especially successful was the 1955 Farnborough Airshow, where he displayed the CF-100 in a &quot;falling-leaf&quot;. He was acclaimed again as the &quot;Great Zura&quot; by many aviation and industry observers. In 1958, he was chosen as the chief development test pilot of the new CF-105 Avro Arrow programme. On 25 March 1958, with Żurakowski at the controls, Arrow RL 25201 took off from Malton, Ontario for its first flight. The flight lasted 35 minutes and was problem-free. Żurakowski continued in the flight test program. He flew Arrows RL 201, 202, and 203 over a total of 21 flights, for 23.75 hours, reaching speeds of Mach 1.89 and an altitude of .

After flying Arrow 203 on 26 September 1958, Żurakowski decided to give up test flying for good, fulfilling a promise he had made to his wife to stop experimental flying once he reached the age of 40, although he had already exceeded that age.

==Later life==
Żurakowski retired from active test flying in November 1958 but continued with the Avro Aircraft company as an engineer in the Flight Test Office. On 20 February 1959, the infamous &quot;Black Friday&quot;, Żurakowski, along with the approximately 15,000 employees of the Avro and Orenda plants, learned that the Diefenbaker government had precipitously cancelled the Avro Arrow programme and its Orenda Iroquois engine. The five flying examples and the newly constructed RL-206 (slated for a run at world air speed and altitude records) along with all the assorted factory jigs and tools were broken up. Only the nose of Arrow 206 and sections of other Arrows remain. They are currently on display at the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa.

After deciding to leave the aviation world altogether, Żurakowski and his family moved to Barry&#x27;s Bay, Ontario to build Kartuzy Lodge (located near Clayfarm Bay at Kartuzy Road and Arrow Drive). He and his family operated this small tourist lodge and resort for over 40 years. During this period, he resorted to his engineering background, &quot;tinkering&quot; with a number of sailboats, catamarans, and ice boats of his own design and construction. Two of his hydrofoil boats are still used by Kartuzy Lodge renters.

Following a lingering battle with myelodysplasia, Żurakowski died at Kartuzy Lodge on 9 February 2004.
==Honours==
In recognition of his contributions to Canadian aviation, Żurakowski was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame in 1973. He was further honoured in 1996 by the Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s release of a commemorative coin, the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck, which featured an insert of Janusz Żurakowski. In 1997, he was inducted into the Western Canada Aviation Museum &quot;Pioneers of Canadian Aviation&quot; annals. He was profiled the following year in the documentary film &quot;Straight Arrow&quot;. On 23 July 1999, CFB Cold Lake (Alberta) Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment named its new facility, the &quot;Żurakowski Building&quot;. In September 2000, he became an honorary fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, joining the ranks of Charles Lindbergh, Neil Armstrong, and Igor Sikorsky, among numerous other luminaries.

Żurakowski received the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in 1999.

His adopted hometown built Żurakowski Park in 2003, recognizing his contributions to the community and to the world. Two imposing statues of Janusz Żurakowski and his beloved Avro Arrow dominate the arrow-shaped Żurakowski Park (an elongated triangle evocative of the Avro Arrow&#x27;s profile). It is located at the crossroads of two main streets in Barry&#x27;s Bay, Ontario. A future museum and visitor&#x27;s commemorative centre consisting of a gazebo and display area will be located at Żurakowski Park.

The former Gloster Aircraft company airfield site at Brockworth has become a residential area in Gloucester, UK and has a &quot;Zura Avenue&quot;.

<text>The 24th Golden Raspberry Awards, or Razzies, were held on February 28, 2004, at the Sheraton Hotel in Santa Monica, California, to honor the worst films the film industry had to offer in 2003.

Late summer box office flop &quot;Gigli&quot; led the pack, receiving nine nominations and becoming the first film to sweep the six major categories (Worst Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay, and Screen Couple). Tied for second most-nominated, with eight each, were the Mike Myers holiday film &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;, a remake of &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; inspired by the television series &quot;American Idol&quot;.

As with Bill Cosby on the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards and Tom Selleck on the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards, respectively, Ben Affleck did not attend the ceremony, but was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that he felt &quot;stiffed&quot; by the Golden Raspberry Awards committee, who did not send the prize out to him. Razzies founder John Wilson delivered the trophy to the studios of &quot;Larry King Live&quot; but Affleck was unimpressed and left it behind. Wilson retrieved the trophy and auctioned it on eBay. The trophy sold for $1700 which Wilson used to pay for the Ivar Theater for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards the next year. Affleck went on to win the first Razzie Reedemer Award in 2014.

<doc id="445465" wikidata="Q605431" url="?curid=445465" title="Crested honey buzzard">
<text>The crested honey buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus) is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, eagles, and harriers. &quot;Pernis ptilorhynchus&quot; has six subspecies. As a medium-sized raptor, their size ranges between . They are also known as the Oriental, Asiatic, or Eastern honey buzzard. The name is derived from its diet, which consists mainly of the larvae of bees and wasps extracted from honey combs.

Crested honey buzzards migrate for breeding to Siberia and Japan during the summer. They then spend the winter in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. They are also a year-round resident in these latter areas. They prefer well-forested areas with open spaces and are found from sea level up to . Unusually for raptors, the sexes can be differentiated.

The species has several adaptations for its specialist diet. These include an elongated head for foraging on underground nests and a groove in the tongue for feeding on honey. A mass of short, dense feathers on the head and neck protect against stinging attacks by social wasps. Juveniles may have adopted Batesian mimicry to deter predators.

==Taxonomy==
The crested honey buzzard was obtained from the island of Java by the Dutch zoologist C.J. Temminck. He depicted and named it as &quot;Falco ptilorhynchus&quot; in March 1821. Temminck&#x27;s later text description submitted to the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale&quot; in July 1823 used the spelling &quot;ptilorhyncus&quot;. Later, in 1839, Temminck used the spelling &quot;ptilorhynchus&quot; in the &quot;Tableau Méthodique&quot;. Both Temmick&#x27;s spellings have been used, for example Salim Ali used &quot;-cus&quot; while Grimmett and others used &quot;-chus&quot;. Recently Dickinson and others have argued that the original spelling &quot;-chus&quot; must stand.

The British Museum Catalogue of Accipitres published in 1874 by R. Bowdler Sharpe lists the names &quot;Falco ptilorhynchus&quot; (attributed to Temminck, 1823) and &quot;Pernis ptilorhynchus&quot; (attributed to J.F. Stephens, 1826). Sharpe was perhaps unaware that Temminck&#x27;s early illustrations had scientific names on the wrappers of the parts (&quot;livraisons&quot;) of his work and he cited Temminck&#x27;s later works. In 1874, the British Museum had 18 specimens of the crested honey buzzard and its Catalogue listed nine different species names of genus &quot;Pernis&quot; for these.

The crested honey buzzard (&quot;Pernis ptilorhynchus&quot;) includes six subspecies, which are shown in the table below.
Despite its name, the crested honey buzzard is not related to &quot;Buteo&quot; buzzards, and is taxonomically closer to the kites.

==Description==

About in size, the crested honey buzzard is a medium-sized raptor. The head lacks a strong superciliary ridge, giving it a facial appearance very unlike a raptor. It appears long-necked with a small head resembling that of a pigeon. It has a long tail and a short head crest. It is brown above, but not as dark as the European honey buzzard, and paler below. A dark throat stripe is present. Unusually for a large bird of prey, the sexes can be distinguished. The male has a blue-grey head with brown iris, while the female&#x27;s head is brown and the iris is yellow. She is slightly larger and darker than the male. The male has two black bands in the tail and three black under wing bands, while the female has three black tail bands and four narrower black under wing bands. The juvenile has extensive black primary tips with narrower underwing bands. It has a yellow cere at the base of the bill, and a dark iris. The colouration and the tail pattern of the species are highly variable.

In flight, it is likely to be mistaken at a distance for the short-toed snake-eagle. However, it can be distinguished by its slimmer head and longer neck. It is usually seen soaring singly or in pairs, or perched on a tree top. It is quiet even while nesting, sometimes uttering a single high-pitched screaming whistle. In flight it has deep elastic beats and high upstrokes. It glides and soars on flat or slightly arched wings at right angles to the body. The long broad wings are well rounded at six-fingered tips. The tail is broad, of medium length with a rounded tip. The tail is shorter than the breadth of the wing bases. The wing span is 2.4 times total length in the Palearctic (Eurasian) subspecies, but 2.0–2.2 in the Indo-Malayan subspecies.

The similarity in plumage between juvenile crested honey buzzards and the &quot;Nisaetus&quot; hawk-eagles may have arisen as a partial protection against predation by larger raptors. The eagles have stronger bills and talons, and are likely to be less vulnerable than the &quot;Pernis&quot; species. Similar mimicry is shown by the juvenile of the European honey buzzard, which resembles the common buzzard. Although the Eurasian Goshawk is capable of killing both species, it is likely to be more cautious about attacking the better protected &quot;Buteo&quot; species. These are examples of Batesian mimicry, named for the English naturalist and explorer H.W. Bates who first reported such mimicry in the context of &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; (moths and butterflies) in 1861.

==Distribution and habitat==
The crested honey buzzard is a summer migrant to Siberia and Korea, Japan, wintering in tropical Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It leaves Siberia in late August and returns in May. The summer sojourn in Japan is April–May to mid-September. Elsewhere, it is more or less resident. Crested buzzards that migrate from breeding areas in Japan to wintering areas in Southeast Asia fly over the East China Sea. This nonstop flight over water is possible because during autumn, winds over the sea blow in the same direction as the birds&#x27; direction of flight (i.e. wind support).

It has been recorded on the Alaskan island of Shemya. This record is the first known occurrence of this species in North America, and the individual photographed represents the subspecies &quot;P. p. orientalis.&quot;

The crested honey buzzard prefers well-forested lowland and hilly areas that are broken by open glades. In South and Southeast Asia it is sometimes found in small groves near villages. It is found from sea level to , occasionally up to . During migrations it goes above .

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet===
The crested honey buzzard is a specialist feeder, living mainly on the larvae of social bees and wasps, and eating bits of comb and honey. It takes other small insect prey such as cicadas. It occasionally eats small birds, reptiles and frogs like other raptors.

===Breeding===
The crested honey buzzard breeds in woodland, and is inconspicuous except in the spring, when the mating display includes wing clapping. The display of roller coasting in flight and fluttering wings at the peak of the ascent are characteristic of the genus &quot;Pernis&quot;. It is as yet uncertain whether the roller coaster display is related to courtship. The breeding season in the migratory range is June to mid-September for central Siberia and April to August in Japan. In India, it is April–June, though it starts in February in South India.

The nest is a platform of sticks across, lined with dry or green leaves. It is located at a height of in conifers in the north, and in banyan, mango, casuarina or coconut in India. The female normally lays two eggs. The colour is variable, ranging from pale cream to chestnut brown. Incubation takes 4–5 weeks, the chicks are fledged in 5–6 weeks and they become independent after a further 58 weeks. Male and female share the responsibilities of rearing the young.

===Adaptations for diet===
Unlike most of their relatives, crested honey buzzards prefer a diet of the larvae, pupae and honey combs of social wasps. In their summer breeding grounds in Japan, the birds dig up underground social wasp nests with their talons. The short toe depth and long talon on the second digit facilitate this behaviour. In addition, the long slender beak with a hooked tip, and the eyes set far back, are adaptations well suited for foraging in underground nests. The tongue has a groove adapted for extracting larvae from the honey comb. In the wintering regions in South Asia, crested honey buzzards are observed attacking social wasp nests in trees.
When foraging both underground and arboreal nests, the birds have to contend with stinging attacks by wasps. The feathers around the head and neck are well suited to repelling attacks. A study in 2016 by a British and a Japanese researcher compared the head and neck feathers of crested honey buzzards with those of the black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;) and grey-faced buzzard (&quot;Butastur indicus&quot;). These are similar raptors, but only the honey buzzard forages on wasp nests. The researchers found significant adaptations of the feathers. The honey buzzard has a dense mat of short feathers under its beak, around its eyes and nostrils and on its neck with barbules closer together. They are stiffer with more hooks and nodes for barbules to attach to one another, yielding an armour like appearance. In the other kites, the feathers are longer and softer, with fewer barbules towards the tips. Thus, more of the skin is exposed. The head and neck feathers of the crested honey buzzard are shorter, being only 50–70% the length of the feathers in the other two species.

The crested honey buzzard may have also evolved a chemical defense. Its feathers were observed to have a white filamentous covering that is not present in black kites and grey-faced buzzards. Videos indicate that social wasps attack bears and other mammals more than they attack honey buzzards. Experiments indicate that the substance from the wings of honey buzzards renders wasps inactive. However, this is as yet speculative and the composition of the substance is yet to be determined. In a wasp attack on two crested honey buzzards observed in Japan, the wasps mainly attacked the head and neck. Their stings were about in size. Most of the stings were embedded in the dense mat of feathers. A few stings pierced the skin where feathers were missing. Thus, the feather adaptations provided partial protection against wasp attacks.

==Threats and conservation==
The IUCN status of the crested honey buzzard is least concern. The bird is inconspicuous and may be undercounted, except during migration. Rough estimates of the population range from 100,000 to 1,000,000.

As climate change affects wind conditions worldwide, the wind support for migration over the migratory pathway over the East China Sea could be reduced. Japanese researchers have developed a mathematical model to estimate the effect of climate change on the favourable winds over this section. They predict a slight reduction in the migratory areas due to this wind change effect by the middle of the 21st century and a complete loss of the migratory pathway by late in the century. The study does not consider possible behavioural adaptations of migratory birds which could possibly compensate for the changing wind patterns.

On the positive side, the species appears to be adapting to the availability of anthropogenic habitats. It has colonized irrigated forest plantations in some areas of Pakistan. It has recently spread to the Middle East and regularly winters in small numbers in Arabia. These birds may be migrating from Siberia using a pathway over Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that is west of the Himalayas.

Falconry as a hobby in Indonesia started in the 1970s. As Facebook is popular in Indonesia, it is used for the illegal sale of raptors. Two studies of a number of Facebook groups were conducted during 2015. In both studies combined, the total number of birds offered for sale was about 10,000. The most popular raptors were black-winged kite and changeable hawk eagle, accounting for about 39% of the 10,000. In contrast, crested honey buzzards accounted for only about 1%.

==In culture==
In the Java island of Indonesia, people living in or near forested areas suffer from attacks, sometimes fatal, by giant honey bees. The local people and honey collectors blame the honey buzzards for these attacks. This raptor attacks the nests of the giant honey bee. As it flies away with a piece of the honeycomb in its claws, it is pursued by angry bees. The local belief is that as its escape strategy the honey buzzard flies close to humans in the vicinity to transfer the attack of the angry bees to the humans. However, in a study of the hunting behaviour of honey buzzards conducted between 2003 and 2019, no evidence of this strategy was observed by the researchers. They surmised that a decline in the habitat due to human activity has increased the conflict between bees and humans.

<text>Khasekhemwy (ca. 2690 BC; &quot;&quot;, also rendered &quot;Kha-sekhemui&quot;) was the last Pharaoh of the Second Dynasty of Egypt. Little is known about him, other than that he led several significant military campaigns and built the mudbrick fort known as Shunet El Zebib.

His Horus name &#x27; can be interpreted &quot;The Two Powerful Ones Appear&quot;, but the name is recorded in many variants, such as &quot;Ḥr-Ḫꜥj-sḫm&quot; (Horus, he whose power appears), &quot;ḫꜥj sḫm.wj ḥtp nṯrwj jm=f&quot; (the two powers appear in that the ancestors rest within him) (etc.) He is also known under his later [[tradition]]ed [[birth name]]Bebty(which is also one of the names of the god [[Horus]]) and under his [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] nameCheneres&quot;&#x27; (by Manetho; derived from &quot;Khasekhemwy&quot;). 

==Date of reign==
Khasekhemwy ruled for close to 18 years, with a &quot;floruit&quot; in the early 27th century BC. The exact date of his reign in Egyptian chronology is unclear but would fall roughly in between 2690–2670 BC.

According to Toby Wilkinson&#x27;s study of the Palermo Stone in &quot;Royal Annals of Ancient Egypt&quot;, this near contemporary 5th dynasty document assigns Khasekhemwy a reign of 17.5 or nearly 18 full years. Wilkinson suggests that a reign of 18 &quot;complete or partial years&quot; can be attributed to Khasekhemwy since the Palermo Stone and its associated fragments record Years 3-6 and Years 12-18 of this king and notes that his final year is recorded in the preserved section of the document. 
Since the cattle count is shown to be regularly biennial during the second dynasty from the Palermo Stone (the year of the 6th, 7th and 8th count is preserved on the document plus full years after these counts respectively), a figure of c. 18 years is likely correct for Khasekhemwy. (or c. 18 years 2 months and 23 days from the main fragment of the Palermo Stone)

== Biography ==

Khasekhemwy is normally placed as the successor of Seth-Peribsen, though some Egyptologists believe that another Pharaoh, Khasekhem, ruled between them. Most scholars, however, believe Khasekhem and Khasekhemwy are, in fact, the same person. Khasekhem may have changed his name to Khasekhemwy after he reunited Upper and Lower Egypt after a civil war between the followers of the gods Horus and Set. Others believe he defeated the reigning king, Seth-Peribsen, after returning to Egypt from putting down a revolt in Nubia. Either way, he ended the infighting of the Second dynasty and reunited Egypt.

Khasekhemwy is unique in Egyptian history as having both the symbols of Horus and Set on his &quot;serekh&quot;. Some Egyptologists believe that this was an attempt to unify the two factions; but after his death, Set was dropped from the serekh permanently. He was the earliest Egyptian king known to have built statues of himself.
Khasekhemwy apparently undertook considerable building projects upon the reunification of Egypt. He built in stone at el-Kab, Hierakonpolis, and Abydos. 

Khasekhemwy built enclosures at Nekhen, and at Abydos (now known as Shunet ez Zebib) and was buried there in the necropolis at Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab. He may also have built the Gisr el-Mudir at Saqqara.

An inscription on a stone vase records him “fighting the northern enemy within Nekheb”. This means that Lower Egypt may have invaded and almost taken the capital of Nekhen.

== Family ==
Khasekhemwy&#x27;s wife was Queen Nimaathap, mother of the King&#x27;s Children. They were the parents of Djoser and Djoser&#x27;s wife Hetephernebti. It is also possible that Khasekhemwy&#x27;s sons were Sekhemkhet and Sanakhte, the two kings succeeding Djoser.

Nimaathap was a northern princess who he titled “King bearing mother”.

==Tomb==
He apparently built a unique, as well as huge, tomb at Abydos, the last such royal tomb built in the Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab necropolis (Tomb V). The trapezoidal tomb measures some 70 meters (230 ft) in length and is 17 meters (56 ft) wide at its northern end, and 10 meters (33 ft) wide at its southern end. This area was divided into 58 rooms. Prior to some recent discoveries from the 1st dynasty, its central burial chamber was considered the oldest masonry structure in the world, being built of quarried limestone. Here, the excavators discovered the king&#x27;s scepter of gold and sard, as well as several beautifully made small stone pots with gold leaf lid coverings, apparently missed by earlier tomb robbers. In fact, Petrie detailed a number of items removed during the excavations of Amélineau. Other items included flint tools, as well as a variety of copper tools and vessels, stone vessels and pottery vessels filled with grain and fruit. There were also small, glazed objects, carnelian beads, model tools, basketwork and a large quantity of seals.

<text>The Limehouse Cut is a largely straight, broad canal in the East End of London which links the lower reaches of the Lee Navigation to the River Thames. Opening on 17 September 1770, and widened for two-way traffic by 1777, it is the oldest canal in the London area. Although short, it has a diverse social and industrial history. Formerly discharging directly into the Thames, since 1968 it has done so indirectly by a connection through Limehouse Basin.

The Cut is about long. It turns in a broad curve from Bow Locks, where the Lee Navigation meets Bow Creek; it then proceeds directly south-west through the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, finally making a short hook to connect to Limehouse Basin.

== Origins ==

===Before the Cut===
Already in Elizabethan times there was a vigorous river trade between towns on the River Lea and the City of London, but watermen had to await the tides and row round the Isle of Dogs. Thus, in 1588 (wrote G. B. G. Bull): The goods came from even further afield: by 1663 the road from Huntingdon and Cambridge was worn out &quot;by reason of the great Trade of Barley and Mault, that cometh to Ware, and so is conveyed by water to the City of London&quot;. In 1739, 25,000 tons of malt and &quot;all sorts of Grain, Flower, and other Commodities&quot; went by the Lee. When the Limehouse Cut was built this traffic had increased to 36,000 tons—about a quarter of London&#x27;s grain supply.

===Planning and authorisation===
The Limehouse Cut was authorised by the Lee Navigation Improvement Act 1767 (7 Geo. 3. c. 51), after the engineer John Smeaton identified the need to make several cuts and to replace existing flash locks on the river with pound locks. It occurred to Smeaton as an afterthought to have a cut from Bromley to the Thames at Limehouse and his assistant Thomas Yeoman had the same idea. Thomas Yeoman was appointed as the surveyor to the River Lee trustees, and one of his first tasks was to investigate a route for the Limehouse Cut. As authorised by Parliament, it would provide a short-cut from the Lee Navigation at Bromley-by-Bow to the River Thames &quot;at or near Limehouse Bridge Dock&quot;, avoiding the tortuous curves of the lower reaches of the River Lea at Bow Creek, and the need to wait for the tide to make the long detour round the Isle of Dogs. The trustees accepted Yeoman&#x27;s proposed route on 14 September 1767, which would terminate at Dingley&#x27;s Wharf at Limehouse.

===Excavation and lock building===
The contract for the excavation of the cut was split into two, with Charles Dingley, owner of the wharf and also a trustee, getting the southern section up to Rose Lane and Jeremiah Ilsley getting the northern section to Bow Locks. Dingley contracted to make his end of the canal for 10d. per foot; Ilsley&#x27;s charge was 7d. per foot.

The construction of Bromley Lock was let as a separate contract, which was awarded to a millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper, who also built some of the locks on the Edmonton Cut. The lock into the Thames was designed by Mr Collard, another of the trustees, who produced a model and plan for the structure. The estimated cost was £1,547, but Collard had miscalculated the length, and it had to be increased by , resulting in the estimate&#x27;s rising to £1,696.

===Inauguration and widening===
By 1769, barges were using part of the cut, and in May 1770 an opening date of 2 July was set. However, of brickwork failed, and fell into the canal, delaying the opening until 17 September. There were further problems in December, when a bridge collapsed, blocking the canal, but once the teething problems were resolved, traffic increased steadily.

The cut was only wide enough for one barge, and in May 1772, a passing place was added, but by March 1773, the company had decided to widen the whole cut, so that barges could pass as any point. The contract for the work was given to Jeremiah Ilsley in June 1776, and the widened cut was operational from 1 September 1777, having cost £975.

===Further widening===

At some stage the Cut was further widened from 55 feet to its present width of 75 feet. When this happened is unclear. It has been suggested it happened during the Beardmore modifications of the 1850s (see below), but this seems improbable. Widening was not called for by Rendel&#x27;s plans, nor is it mentioned by Beardmore himself. Possibly it happened during the construction of the Commercial Road. An 1809 print seems to show widening excavations alongside the Cut.

===Hydraulics===
Although the newly constructed Limehouse Cut could save vessels time navigating down Bow Creek and around the Isle of Dogs, its performance was suboptimal. Unusually, it was a tidal canal. It could be short of water and liable to shoal.

At the northern end of the Cut was a conflict with a property called Four Mills, which was in fact a group of five tidal water wheels. Nathaniel Beardmore, the Lee trustees&#x27; engineer, described the conflict as it was in early Victorian times: At an 1850 inquiry by William Cubitt it was explained that because the Cut was unnavigable for four or five days at neap tides, barges had no way out to the Thames except via Bow Creek (which was toll free). Hence the tolls were lost.

The Cut had no locks except at either end—despite the fall in the land, which was 17½ feet. The shallowest point was therefore critical. &quot;Limehouse Cut had always occasioned a great deal of trouble&quot;, added Beardmore, &quot;on account of the water falling short, and of the slipping of the moving sands and gravel, which lay where the London clay was denuded&quot;. No systematic attempt to improve the navigation was made until the Victorian era.

===The Limehouse basin—first of three===
Near its Limehouse end the Cut was widened to form a basin with an island in it. This was the first Limehouse basin, made 25 years before the better known Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock. The reason for this is described below, see &quot;The Island in the Cut and its mills&quot;.

==Victorian modifications==
===Railway competition===
By 1843 a railway had been built from Stratford to Hertford: it became the Eastern Counties Railway. The line ran beside the River Lee and threatened its carrying trade.

===Closing the Four Mills===
As an essential first step in 1847 the trustees of the Lee Navigation bought out the troublesome Four Mills and gradually stopped them using water power.

===James Rendel&#x27;s scheme===
In 1849 James Rendel was asked to devise a scheme to improve the infrastructure, which was dilapidated. He reported that &quot;if [the Navigation] is to compete successfully with Railways, it should be made an efficient branch of the Thames, viz. navigable by the largest class of barges there employed&quot;. He proposed, besides numerous improvements on the river proper, the reconstruction of Bromley Lock; deepening the Limehouse Cut; forming a towing path under Britannia Bridge (Commercial Road); and the construction of a new outfall lock into the Thames, with cills 19 feet below Trinity High Water, and with tide gates.

===Financing and politics===
The engineering of the Limehouse Cut was affected by political disputes upstream. The Lee had multiple uses. It was a highway for traders. It supplied London with drinking water. It powered grain mills. It was a sewer for towns and factories. There was no Conservancy Board to manage these clashing interests, just the trustees responsible for its navigation.

The navigation of the River Lee was governed by a board of 65–120 unpaid trustees, typically country magistrates. The most influential was James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, who became chairman in 1851. A powerful nobleman with a deep knowledge of parliamentary procedure, his biographer has described him as an eighteenth century aristocrat in a nineteenth century world. Of the few trustees who used to turn up to meetings, only one was a trader who owned barges.
Rendel&#x27;s estimate for his scheme was £230,000—about £30 million today—yet the Trust&#x27;s revenue was small. However, John Marchant, clerk to the trustees, had hit on the idea of borrowing the capital and paying off the loans by selling more water to the London water companies. This was essential to the scheme&#x27;s success, Hertford&#x27;s MP William Cowper told Parliament.

The scheme was controversial. It was opposed by many river traders who complained the benefits were not worth the money and the Trust would incur large debts: meaning higher tolls. Its promoters were certain it would pay for itself. At an unusually large meeting of the Trust at Ware, the scheme was carried by 27–25 votes. A Bill was put before Parliament to authorise it and, despite opposition from radical politician John Bright—who suspected an ulterior motive—became law on 1 August 1850.

The pessimists proved correct. While the London water companies were interested in buying the water, and had said so, they had not tied themselves to a price; and soon showed who had the stronger bargaining power. First, the New River [Water] Company struck a deal with the town of Hertford to get water from the pure and copious River Mimram—an upstream tributary, outside the Lee Trust&#x27;s jurisdiction. Then they and the East London Waterworks applied for Acts of Parliament of their own, by which they would get the River Lee&#x27;s water. There was litigation; the Trust ran into cashflow problems; and the eventual compromise was that the Companies got the whole of the River Lee&#x27;s water—apart from that required for navigation—for comparatively small amounts.

The upshot was that though there were valuable improvements, the Trust incurred a large debt without any obvious means to pay it off. Though they had increased the tolls (sometimes steeply), they ran out of funds. Sacrifices had to be made, and were made on the Limehouse Cut.

===Beardmore&#x27;s implementation===
Rendel&#x27;s plans were implemented by his former pupil Nathaniel Beardmore. The first tranche of work was supposed to comprise the tidal portion (from the Thames to Old Ford), hence the Limehouse Cut. However funds ran out, work stopped in 1853, and some of Rendel&#x27;s plans had to be curtailed. When more funding became available in 1855 it had to be devoted to non-tidal parts of the Lee.

Some changes were made before funds ran out, with the following effect. The governing level in Limehouse Cut was increased: the water was not allowed to fall 2 feet below Trinity High Water mark. The Cut under the Commercial Road bridge was made wider and given a towpath. Larger barges could now be handled:
These and other improvements were said to increase the tonnage on the Lee Navigation by 25% (but the tolls by 50%), despite competition from the Eastern Counties Railway.

====The Regent&#x27;s Canal Company: temporary link to their basin====

The outlet to the Thames, &quot;an old timber lock of small dimensions&quot;, had become &quot;more and more ruinous&quot;. In October 1852 Beardmore reported that &quot;The Limehouse Lock has bulged and the late Lock keepers house must be pulled down both to get at the repair required and because the house is in the act of Tumbling down&quot;.

At about this time the Lee trustees, who were afterwards alleged to be too cosy with the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company, agreed to sell it the southern portion of the Limehouse Cut. Since it was public trust property it could not be done without the sanction of Parliament, to whom a Bill was presented. The nearby Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock, already enlarged to a 9-acre basin, was crowded with shipping so the Company intended to enlarge it further, absorbing Limehouse Cut&#x27;s lock and the remnants of its basin.

While this matter was pending a link was dug (early 1854) to the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock, thus affording an alternative outlet to the river. Work south of the Commercial road was supervised jointly by Beardmore and the Regent Canal&#x27;s engineer.

The new route to the Thames could get congested and the proposal was not popular with the Lee and Stort bargemen. said a Harlow bargeman. They disliked the prospect of being under Regent&#x27;s Canal regulations. They organised meetings, learnt to use the democratic machinery of the day, and defeated the proposal in Parliament reputedly at small cost to themselves. The Regent&#x27;s Canal Company had to be content with a more modest dock enlargement and in May 1864 the link was filled in.

Beardmore replaced the old timber Limehouse Lock with an &quot;economical structure&quot; which was wider and had arched sheets overhead to stop bulging, after the Dutch fashion.

====Britannia Bridge and Lock====
Britannia Bridge is where the Commercial Road crosses the Cut. It was named after the Britannia Tavern (c.1770-1911), which can be found in Horwood&#x27;s 1819 map and is visible in the image &quot;Limehouse in 1809&quot; (above, &quot;Further widening&quot;), left background. The original bridge cramped the Cut and interrupted its towpath.

When the Limehouse Cut was connected to the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock (above), a potential hydraulic problem was created. Since the Limehouse Cut was tidal, but the Regent&#x27;s Canal was not, at times water might escape from the Dock and move up the Cut. (Conversely, at other times water from the Cut might overfill the Dock.) To restrict the loss of water a new lock was built at Britannia Bridge. It was a double regulating lock, with gates pointing in both directions, and new wing walls so as to form, conjointly, a new and more spacious Bridge. Horses could pass along the new towpath underneath. The work was supervised jointly by Beardmore and the Regent Canal&#x27;s engineer.

The lock gates were little used (&quot;they never were, nor could be, used to keep out the tidal water, which comes into the Cut through many channels&quot;, wrote engineer Joe Child), and they were removed.

====The new Bromley Lock====
Bromley Lock was completely rebuilt in a slightly different position. Said Beardmore: The new lock was 137 feet long and 22 feet broad, with cills 11 feet below Trinity high water mark.

In 1888 Joe Child (one of Beardmore&#x27;s successors) wrote: Bromley Lock was finally removed; according to Lee historian Richard Thomas, one gate can still be seen, behind the floating towpath.

==Twentieth century modifications==
Bow Locks were originally semi-tidal, as high spring tides flowed over the top of the locks, altering the level in the Limehouse Cut and the southern section of the Lee Navigation. They were modified in 2000, when a flood wall and an extra pair of flood gates were installed, enabling the lock to be used at all states of the tide and stabilising the level of the cut. Funding for the project was provided by the London Waterway Partnership.

Following the takeover of the canal by British Waterways in 1948, a vertical guillotine gate was fitted on the north side of Britannia Bridge but this was removed in the 1990s.

===New link to Limehouse Basin===
By the 1960s, the lock that connected the cut to the Thames was in need of replacement. It had been rebuilt in 1865, after the closing of the link to the Regents Canal Dock, and the design had included massive timber ties over the top of it to prevent bulging of the walls. These were eventually replaced with a steel cage, which served the same purpose. Access to the lock from the cut and from the Thames was awkward, and the gates were operated by winches and chains as the site was too narrow to accommodate balance beams. At the time, there was significant commercial activity on the cut, which would have been severely disrupted by the construction of a new lock. The solution adopted was to reinstate a link to the Regents Canal Dock. The route used in the 1860s could not be reused, as it was now covered by buildings, and so a new length of canal, only about long, was built. The new link was opened on 1 April 1968, when the tug &quot;Miriam&quot; towed four lighters through it. The old lock was then filled in but one of the winches was saved and was put on display at Hampstead Lock.

== Social and industrial history ==

===The Island in the Cut and its mills===
John Cary&#x27;s &quot;New and Accurate Plan of London&quot; of 1795 shows that, by that date, a portion of the canal, near its outlet at Limehouse, had been expanded to form a large basin, with an island in the middle marked &quot;Timber Yd&quot;, accessible by a causeway. This was the first basin in Limehouse, built 25 years before the better known Regent&#x27;s Canal dock, a little to the west, which now bears that name. (There was yet another of that name: the western entrance to the West India Docks.).

====Charles Dingley&#x27;s sawmill====

In Richard Horwood&#x27;s 1819 map (extract reproduced here) the basin with Island are drawn to scale; nearby rows of houses are named &#x27;Island Row&#x27; and &#x27;Mill Place&#x27;, respectively. Those streets still exist in Limehouse but the &quot;Island&quot; and the &quot;Mill&quot; themselves are largely forgotten. They originated as follows.

Charles Dingley was an entrepreneur and speculator who built, amongst many other things, the southern end of the Limehouse Cut. At that time wooden planks were expensive because they were sawn by hand, or imported ready sawn; in England there was hostility to sawmills, which were thought to be illegal. Dingley, who was also a major timber merchant, decided to defy convention by building a wind-powered sawmill. He bought up a &quot;stranglehold&quot; of land in Limehouse and built the sawmill strategically close to the line of the intended Cut, which he may have promoted with that very intention. It was the only sawmill in England and did good business.

However, on 10 May 1768—the day of the St George&#x27;s Fields Massacre riots—a mob of 500 men, including hand-sawyers, attacked his sawmill and destroyed the machinery—anticipating the Luddite machine-smashers of later years. It caused Parliament to pass the Malicious Injury Act 1769 (9 Geo. 3. c. 29) making it a felony to vandalise mills. Dingley repaired his mill by 1769. Surviving records are consistent with the island and basin being constructed to isolate and protect the repaired sawmill.

====The Island Lead Mills====
The sawmill fell into disuse before 1806, but by 1817 a lead mill was built on the island, called The Island Lead Mills. It continued a thriving business into the twentieth century—it had one of the first telephones in the East End of London—and its barges used the Cut; the company ceased to exist only in 1982.

By about 1868, however, the expanding Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock had encroached so that the Island was no longer strictly such, and further portions were filled in later in the nineteenth century. Even so, traces can still be discerned adjacent Victory Place, Limehouse, which is built on the site.

===Boatbuilding alongside Limehouse Cut===
At Limehouse, across the Cut from the Island, was the boatyard of T &amp; W Forrestt, builders to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The firm built the Institution&#x27;s self-righting lifeboat, which they publicised by testing in the waters of the adjoining Cut. Reportedly these boats saved upwards of 12,000 lives. Other notable builds included the Admiralty&#x27;s fast anti-torpedo boats powered by the noiseless Willans engine, and the yawl &quot; Rob Roy&quot; (one of the first vessels used in solo adventuring). When it became urgent to send an expedition to the Sudan to rescue General Gordon the firm built and delivered, in less than a month, 100 boats to a special design for ascending the cataracts of the Nile.

Forrestt&#x27;s yard was called Norway Yard, a name that survives in Norway Place. The image—an engraving in the Illustrated London News—shows the boatyard after its restoration from a disastrous 1858 fire. In the foreground is the London and Blackwall Railway with (in the distance) Stepney Station, now Limehouse DLR. The railway arches traverse Mill Place and Island Row. The Cut is visible at left centre. Across the Cut is the Island, with the Island Lead Mills (smoking chimney). The rigging in the background reveals shipping lying in the Thames (left) or in the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock (centre).

===Stinkhouse Bridge===
Bow Common Lane met the Cut at Stinkhouse Bridge, so called even in official documents. The name first appears in an 1819 map and in an 1826 magistrates&#x27; report listing the bridges of Middlesex.

It was a desolate area originally, recalled a local historian, so chemical manufacturers went there for the opportunity to pollute. Hence the stench and the name. A subsidiary cause was filth from the notorious Black Ditch—a medieval sewer, originating in Spitalfields and discharging its waste in Limekiln Dock. At this place an open ditch, it had been fed under the Cut by a syphon, but it overflowed in stormy weather. More than once Stinkhouse Bridge required the attention of Joseph Bazalgette himself. &quot;The smell is so bad that sometimes we cannot sleep in our beds&quot;, complained an 1856 petition. The main cause of the stink, thought Bazalgette, was factories discharging effluent into the Cut.
As time went by Stinkhouse Bridge became the nucleus of &quot;the largest chemical and inflammable factories in London&quot;: the district was a fire risk. In 1866 it caught fire at last. So tremendous was the blaze that, reportedly, every unit in the London Fire Brigade knew to turn out—and where to go—just by &quot;the great light in the sky&quot;. Many people jumped into the Cut to avoid being burned to death.

About 200 yards up the Cut was the RNLI&#x27;s storeyard. Lifeboats were kept there prior to release to service. Before that, they were sunk in the waters of the Cut to test their self-righting powers, as shown. The tests also required men to stand on a gunwale until it was submerged. Across the Cut began the notorious Fenian Barracks slum area, see below.

There are many reports of individuals trying to end their lives by jumping off Stinkhouse Bridge. In 1909 Coroner Wynne Baxter remarked that he had held inquests on over 50 suicides there. In a derisory attempt to enhance its image it was renamed Lavender Bridge. So dirty was the water that when a local labourer dived in to save a woman trying to drown herself, the magistrate awarded him special compensation from the poor box.

The bridge was rebuilt in 1929. It continued to be a well known East End placename even after the stink had gone. In &quot;Call the Midwife: A True Story of the East End in the 1950s&quot; the runaway Irish girl Mary lingers at Stinkhouse Bridge. &quot;It was pleasant standing by the bridge, looking down at the moving water.&quot;

===Bathing===
In 1833 the Limehouse Cut was the place most frequented for bathing, an East London magistrate told Parliament. The authorities tried to ban the practice for indecency.

===Pollution. The cholera and smallpox controversies.===

====The Cut becomes an open sewer====
Until about 1815 it was illegal to discharge human waste except into cesspools; &quot;sewers&quot; originally were for rainwater. Then the practice gradually changed and in 1846 it became compulsory to drain houses into sewers. Sewers had always discharged into the Thames, and so Limehouse Cut itself became another sewer — in the modern sense — and, when population and industries crowded around its banks, a &quot;very filthy&quot; one.

William Farr wrote that in 1849 some houses near the Lea had no drinking-water supply, so the poor were forced to dip their pails in the Limehouse Cut. Apart from the chemical waste, he said, &quot;the canal is a receptacle for dead dogs, cats, and other small animals, frequently seen floating on the discoloured waters; and on every occasion of opening the locks at Bromley there is a rush of floating scum into the Lea&#x27;. Amongst those who drank the water, deaths by cholera were observed.

As population increased the Lee itself became polluted with sewage, as did the Thames: the sewage was brought in by the tides and locked in the Cut, where it accumulated. In 1866 the Lee Navigation&#x27;s engineer agreed that in hot dry weather the Cut was &quot;An open continuous cesspit ... As foul as it could be.&quot;. In 1877 it was complained the layer of sediment was several feet thick.

====Cholera epidemic====
In 1866 there was a major cholera epidemic in East London. Conventional medicine (the miasma theory) blamed polluted air, so there was an outcry against the Limehouse Cut. However, &quot;The Lancet&quot; appointed a sanitary commission who plotted the cases on a large map and discovered that living near (or far from) the canal had nothing to do with the risk of dying of the disease. They were led to reject the miasma explanation and to suspect the drinking-water. It was afterwards proved that faecally contaminated water had got into the East London Waterworks Company&#x27;s supply and been pumped to households — a step in medical science towards rejecting the miasma theory and establishing the currently accepted germ theory of disease.

But Thomas Orton, the Limehouse medical officer of health, was not a convert. In his district, he said, &quot;water-drinkers&quot; (teetotallers) scarcely ever got the cholera: it must be the bad air from the canals.

====The smallpox hospital====
In 1876 there was a smallpox outbreak in London and the authorities struggled to find suitable hospital accommodation. Some patients were placed in a hospital in Hampstead but this attracted the ire of local residents; one of them, Sir Rowland Hill, sued. The authorities then rented the disused Silver factory - sandwiched between the Limehouse Cut and Dod Street - and made plans to convert it into a hospital. It infuriated East Enders that West End bureaucrats should send smallpox patients to a crowded working district in Limehouse (&quot;Another opportunity for the West to look down on and revile the denizens of the East&quot; sneered the &quot;East London Observer&quot;) and there were demonstrations in Trafalgar Square and threats of violence.

Samuel Charlesworth, Rector of St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse, wrote that it was a very bad place for patients anyway. Highly insalubrious, it had no ventilation &quot;to move the fog often settling there, except the current of offensive vapour moving up and down the fœtid canal.&quot; He, the Rev. Charleswoth, knew the Cut was unhealthy because he lived next to it himself; his children &quot;when at home always fail in health&quot;. Opposite, six children of one family had died in one month — of some blood infection. Their coffins had been superposed in the same grave.

====Cleanup====
But the cleanup of Limehouse Cut was already underway. It worked for two reasons: Bazalgette&#x27;s strategic system of intercepting sewers; and an act of Parliament, the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 75), which gave the Lee Conservancy Board powers to pursue polluters — for this purpose the Limehouse Cut was deemed to be part of the Lee — and to dredge sewage. In the Cut, already by 1877 the board had closed down 36 private sewers. By the end of the century its dredgers were removing 40 tons of sediment a day.

===The Burdett Road Bridge enclave===
In 1819 the Cut ran through open countryside from Bromley lock to Britannia Bridge, Commercial Road. There was no way of crossing this except at Stinkhouse Bridge. To the northwest, see map, was the Patent Cable Works, a long ropewalk founded by Captain Joseph Huddart where was made his twice-as-strong ship&#x27;s cable. In due course the area was built up, the Cable Works closed and in 1858 its line was used to construct the &quot;Victoria Park Approach Road&quot; — soon renamed Burdett Road after philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts. A new bridge had to be made over the Cut. For the sake of the barge traffic Parliament required the bridge to allow headroom of at least &quot;Eight Feet above High Water Mark, Trinity Standard&quot;.

====Dod Street and socialism====

Dod Street, on the corner by Burdett Road Bridge and whose factories overlooked the Cut, was built and named by 1861. It first attracted public attention in the smallpox hospital controversy (above) and then as a site for Sunday political meetings. Socialists like John Burns, Amie Hicks, Henry Hyndman Eleanor Marx, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw, among others, were speakers there.

====The Dod Street trick====

Dod Street gave rise to the expression &quot;the Dod Street trick&quot; used in socialist politics. The police felt these meetings were subversive and sought to prevent them by arresting demonstrators for highway obstruction. Since there was no traffic to obstruct — it was a street of canal-side factories on a Sunday — the police were perceived as denying freedom of speech.

The Dod Street trick, devised to counter this, was thus described by Bernard Shaw: which is what happened. Public indignation gathered enormous crowds of people — only a very few of which were socialists — and they were let alone.

The image captioned &quot;The law blacks William Morris&#x27; boots&quot; is a political caricature mocking class justice and Morris&#x27; genteel socialism. At a trial in Arbour Square magistrates court, plebeian demonstrators had been found guilty and punished, but Morris was only dismissed with a warning. It symbolically has the law blacking Morris&#x27; boots in Dod Street — his foot rests on comrades who did get jail time or &quot;smarting&quot; fines — while on his banner is an ironical reference to his high-flown poem The Earthly Paradise.

The cartoon captioned &quot;Dod Street Demonstrations&quot; contains an inset which, though incidentally, illustrates the area in late Victorian times. The detail is reproduced here. The points towards Limehouse Cut.

In the left foreground is the rubber factory of Abbott, Anderson &amp; Abbott who made the capes for the Metropolitan Police and oilskins for the Royal Navy.

The last building on the left — the one with the double lamps — is the &quot;Silver Tavern&quot; public house, informal headquarters of the East End Football Association, in which played such teams as Millwall Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur and the East End mission of Eton College.

In the distance is St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse, while at the bottom of the street can be seen the Burdett Road horse-drawn tramway — a tram has just crossed the Bridge. Across Burdett Road begins the notorious St Anne Street Rookery, described below.

The last building on the right is a warehouse soon to become the Outcasts&#x27; Haven (below).

====Cutting edge industry====

Taking up most of the north side of Dod Street and backing onto the Limehouse Cut was the highly innovative H. Herrmann factory. Opened in 1877 by American Henry Herrmann, it made hardwood furniture and was the first in England to do so almost entirely by machine. Its stock of timber — easily imported by water — was described in the &quot;East London Observer&quot; as &quot;something enormous&quot;, yet swiftly turned into good furniture &quot;at the lowest possible prices&quot;. Handled by a steam crane — risky in timber yards — the whole factory burned down in a colossal fire in 1887. (The fire got dangerously close to the East London Saltpetre Works, until extinguished by the Fire Brigade&#x27;s floating engines on the Cut). Herrmann rebuilt the factory and introduced one of the world&#x27;s first electric travelling cranes to save on the steep insurance premiums. As there was no electrical supply in London, he generated his own, and had the factory electrically lit.

At Herrmann&#x27;s in 1884, while planning his London bombing campaign, worked Irish-American dynamitard Harry Burton; he lodged round the corner in Pelling Street.

The Fire Brigade continued to use floating fire engines on the Cut (&quot;fire boats&quot;) until at least 1929.

====The Outcasts&#x27; Haven====

In a disused warehouse at 1A Dod Street, opposite the Silver Tavern, was the Outcasts&#x27; Haven. According to Charles Dickens Jr., the first rule of the establishment was this: Any policeman on the beat &quot;who finds some poor outcast shrinking from the flash of his lantern&quot;, wrote Dickens, knew to send the child to Dod Street.

But, according to an exposé in the investigative journal &quot;Truth&quot;, it was part of a charity scam. Run by a man called Walter Austin and his mistress Frances Napton (&quot;the Lady Superintendent&quot;), the charity put on stunts (see illustration), sent out heart-rending appeals, collected large donations, but kept no proper accounts. While it did spend some money on homeless children, its proprietor lived well.

===Victorian recycling===
East End refuse collectors — called &quot;dustmen&quot;, because households produced much coal ash — took the product to two yards on the Limehouse Cut, where it was hand-sorted into separate hills by gangs of old men, women and boys. The ash and breeze was sent by barge to Kent, where it was made into bricks; the rags, bones and metal were sold to &quot;marine-store dealers&quot;; the old tin was sold to trunk-makers; the old bricks and oyster shells were sold to builders and road-makers; the old boots were sold to Prussian blue manufacturers; the money and jewellery were kept.

The Copenhagen Wharf recycling facility can just be discerned in the 1886 photograph (left background). The scene is a few yards west of Burdett Road bridge. In the centre is Hirsch&#x27;s Copenhagen Oil Mills, where seeds were crushed to make oil. Dumb barges are moored in the foreground. To the right is the Victoria Lead Works.

===Rookeries===
A rookery was a slum area whose inhabitants aggressively and cooperatively opposed law enforcement.

====St Anne&#x27;s Street Rookery====
Across Burdett Road was St Anne&#x27;s Rookery, &quot;a vile quarter lying between Limehouse Church and Limehouse-cut&quot;. Marked black on Charles Booth&#x27;s poverty maps — the colour coding denoted &quot;Lowest class. Vicious, semi-criminal&quot; — it was one of the few slums alongside the Cut; usually, the land was too valuable for housing.

This notorious enclave, into which a policeman might be dragged by a mob, continually featured in newspaper reports. It included St Anne Street, where a man starved his wife in &quot;peculiarly horrible&quot; circumstances (1872); and Merchant&#x27;s Row, where a labourer kicked his mother to death (1897). Law enforcement could be dangerous.

====The Fenian Barracks====
Even more dangerous to police was the district near Stinkhouse Bridge bounded by Limehouse Cut to the south and centred on Furze Street. Charles Booth&#x27;s police informants called it the Fenian Barracks, which &quot;sent more police to hospital than any other block in London and in which only Irish were tolerated to settle&quot;.

George H. Duckworth, one of Booth&#x27;s researchers, wrote that the Barracks was about the worst district in London — &quot;three policemen wounded there last week&quot;. According to his informant Inspector Carter, if they attempted an arrest &quot;a rescue is always organized. They fling brick bats, iron, any thing they can lay their hands on.&quot; As was typical for rookeries, adjoining houses had internal passages designed for eluding police pursuit. Summarised Duckworth: In contrast, rent collectors went about the district in broad daylight wearing top hats and black coats and carrying umbrellas.

A fat refinery alongside the canal attracted visitors who, said Inspector Carter, were more terrifying than the human inhabitants: 

The East End was surveyed again in 1929 by researchers from the London School of Economics who found that, though poor areas in East London were much less widespread than in Charles Booth&#x27;s time, the Fenian Barracks area was still an ugly pocket of chronic poverty.

===Caird &amp; Rayner===

At 777 Commercial Road, opposite Limehouse Church, and backing onto the Limehouse Cut, stands a derelict building bearing the faded sign &quot;V.I.P. Garage&quot;. Originally (1869) a ships chandler&#x27;s, with the best surviving example of a sail loft in Docklands, it was then extended to the east and formed the workshop and offices of Caird &amp; Rayner. This firm specialised in desalination apparatus, crucial for maintaining ship&#x27;s boilers — and drinking water — on long sea voyages. Patented in 1888, their apparatus was fitted on dreadnoughts, British and Japanese battleships, Cunard liners, and &quot;the Czar&#x27;s new yacht&quot;. A specimen is in the Science Museum. Water from the Cut was used for testing the equipment. The firm moved in 1972.

In 2000 the building was listed, both for its historical and architectural interest. The engineering workshop is a very early example of fully steel structural framework, probably the only surviving one in London.

===National politics===
On 25 January 1981 the Gang of Four stood on the bridge over former Limehouse Lock and issued the Limehouse Declaration.

===Other names===
Limehouse Cut has been known by other or alternative names:

== Today ==

Most use of the canal is for pleasure, both on the water and beside the water on the towpaths. Regent&#x27;s Canal, the Hertford Union Canal, the Lee Navigation and the Limehouse Cut form a four-sided loop, covering a distance of , which can be walked or cycled. The scenic towpaths cut across roads and railways in the area, providing a distinct viewpoint.

Access on foot along the Limehouse Cut was difficult in the area below the Blackwall Tunnel approach road, but was made easier as a result of an innovative scheme to create a floating towpath. This was opened in July 2003 and consisted of 60 floating pontoons, creating a walkway complete with green glowing edges.

The Cut is part of the Lee Navigation and is administered by the Canal &amp; River Trust. It was built for sailing barges, and can accommodate vessels which are . Headroom is limited to . The lock from Limehouse Basin to the Thames was originally a ship lock, but has been replaced with a smaller one. Although the area around Limehouse Basin and the original lock into the Thames have been extensively developed as part of the Docklands Regeneration scheme, the row of houses overlooking the lock, which were built in 1883 by the Lee Conservators, have been retained and refurbished, while the site of the lock is now a shallow pool. At the end of the London 2012 torch relay, David Beckham arrived with the Olympic torch on a speedboat via the Limehouse Cut to the Olympic opening ceremony.
