<text>The Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus), also known as the Mongolian camel, domestic Bactrian camel or two-humped camel, is a large camel native to the steppes of Central Asia. It has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped dromedary. Its population of 2 million exists mainly in the domesticated form. Their name comes from the ancient historical region of Bactria.

Domesticated Bactrian camels have served as pack animals in inner Asia since ancient times. With its tolerance for cold, drought, and high altitudes, it enabled the travel of caravans on the Silk Road. Bactrian camels, whether domesticated or feral, are a separate species from the wild Bactrian camel, which is the only truly wild (as opposed to feral) species of camelid in the Old World. Domestic Bactrian camels do not descend from wild Bactrian camels, with the two species having split around 1 million years ago.

== Taxonomy ==
The Bactrian camel shares the genus &quot;Camelus&quot; with the dromedary (&quot;C. dromedarius&quot;) and the wild Bactrian camel (&quot;C. ferus&quot;). The Bactrian camel belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first European to describe the camels: in his 4th century BCE &quot;History of Animals&quot;, he identified the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The Bactrian camel was given its current binomial name &quot;Camelus bactrianus&quot; by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

Though sharing a closer common ancestor with it than with the dromedary, the domestic Bactrian camel does not descend from the wild Bactrian camel, with the two species having diverged hundreds of thousands of years ago, with their mitochondrial genomes estimated to have diverged around 1 million years ago. Genetic evidence suggests that both Bactrian camel species are closely related to the extinct giant camel species &quot;Camelus knoblochi&quot; which became extinct around 20,000 years ago, which is equidistant from both living Bactrian camel species.

The Bactrian camel and the dromedary often interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Where the ranges of the two species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Iran and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding between them. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the Bactrian camel and the dromedary should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene revealed that the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.

== Description ==

The Bactrian camel is the largest mammal in its native range and is the largest living camel while being shorter at the shoulder than the dromedary. Shoulder height is from with the overall height ranging from , head-and-body length is , and the tail length is . At the top of the humps, the average height is .
Body mass can range from , with males weighing around , and females around . Its long, wooly coat varies in colour from dark brown to sandy beige. A mane and beard of long hair occurs on the neck and throat, with hairs measuring up to long.

The shaggy winter coat is shed extremely rapidly, with huge sections peeling off at once, appearing as if sloppily shorn. The two humps on the back are composed of fat (not water as is sometimes thought). The face is typical of a camelid, being long and somewhat triangular, with a split upper lip. The long eyelashes, along with the sealable nostrils, help to keep out dust in the frequent sandstorms which occur in their natural range. The two broad toes on each foot have undivided soles and are able to spread widely as an adaptation to walking on sand. The feet are very tough, as befits an animal of extreme environments.

== Natural habitat ==
These camels are migratory, and their habitat ranges from rocky mountain massifs to flat , arid desert, (mostly the Gobi Desert), stony plains and sand dunes. Conditions are extremely harsh – vegetation is sparse, water sources are limited and temperatures are extreme. The coat of the Bactrian camel can withstand cold as low as in winter to in summer. The camels&#x27; distribution is linked to the availability of water, with large groups congregating near rivers after rain or at the foot of the mountains, where water can be obtained from springs in the summer months, and in the form of snow during the winter.

== Life history ==

Bactrian camels are exceptionally adept at withstanding wide variations in temperature, ranging from freezing cold to blistering heat. They have a remarkable ability to go without water for months at a time, but when water is available they may drink up to 57 liters at once. When well fed, the humps are plump and erect, but as resources decline, the humps shrink and lean to the side. When moving faster than a walking speed, they pace, by stepping forwards with both legs on the same side (as opposed to trotting, using alternate diagonals as done by most other quadrupeds). Speeds of up to have been recorded, but they rarely move this fast. Bactrian camels are also said to be good swimmers. The sense of sight is well developed and the sense of smell is extremely good. The lifespan of Bactrian camels is estimated at up to 50 years, more often 20 to 40 in captivity.

=== Diet ===

Bactrian camels are diurnal, sleeping in the open at night and foraging for food during the day. They are primarily herbivorous. With tough mouths that can withstand sharp objects such as thorns, they are able to eat plants that are dry, prickly, salty or bitter, and can ingest virtually any kind of vegetation. When other nutrient sources are not available, these camels may feed on carcasses, gnawing on bones, skin, or various different kinds of flesh. In more extreme conditions, they may eat any material they find, which has included rope, sandals, and even tents. Their ability to feed on a wide range of foods allows them to live in areas with sparse vegetation. The first time food is swallowed, it is not fully chewed. The partly masticated food (called cud) goes into the stomach and later is brought back up for further chewing.

Bactrian camels belong to a fairly small group of animals that regularly eat snow to provide their water needs. Animals living above the snowline may have to do this, as snow and ice can be the only forms of water during winter, and by doing so, their range is greatly enlarged. The latent heat of snow and ice is big compared with the heat capacity of water, forcing animals to eat only small amounts at a time.

=== Reproduction ===

Bactrian camels are induced ovulators – they ovulate after insemination (insertion of semen into the vagina); the seminal plasma, not the spermatozoa, induces ovulation. Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 hours and the rest by 48 hours (the same as natural mating). The least amount of semen required to elicit ovulation is about 1.0 ml.

Males during mating time are often quite violent and may bite, spit, or attempt to sit on other male camels. The age of sexual maturity varies, but is usually reached at 3–5 years. Gestation lasts around 13 months. One or occasionally two calves are produced, and the female can give birth to a new calf every other year. Young Bactrian camels are precocial, being able to stand and run shortly after birth, and are fairly large at an average birth weight of . They are nursed for about 1.5 years. The young calf stays with its mother for three to five years, until it reaches sexual maturity, and often helps raise subsequent generations for those years. Wild camels sometimes breed with domesticated or feral camels.

==Genome==

The provides a &quot;C. bactrianus ferus&quot; genome using next generation sequencing.

Several effective population size studies have been carried out. They show several bottlenecks in both wild and domesticated Bactrians over the past 350,000 years.

== Relationship to humans ==

The Bactrian camel was domesticated circa ~4,500 BCE. The dromedary is believed to have been domesticated between 4000 BCE and 2000 BCE in Arabia. As pack animals, these ungulates are virtually unsurpassed, able to carry at a rate of per day, or over a period of four days. The species was a mainstay of transportation on the Silk Road. Furthermore, Bactrian camels are frequently ridden, especially in desertified areas. In ancient Sindh, for example, Bactrian camels of two humps were initially used by the rich for riding. The camel was later brought to other areas such as Balochistan and Iran for the same purpose.

Bactrian camels have been the focus of artwork throughout history. For example, westerners from the Tarim Basin and elsewhere were depicted in numerous ceramic figurines of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907).

=== United States imports ===
Bactrian camels were imported to the U.S. several times in the mid- to late 19th century, both by the U.S. military and by merchants and miners, looking for pack animals sturdier and hardier than horses and mules. Although the camels met these needs, the United States Camel Corps was never considered much of a success. Having brought two shipments of fewer than 100 camels to the U.S., plans were made to import another 1,000, but the US Civil War interrupted this. Most surviving camels of these endeavors, both military and private, were merely turned loose to survive in the wild. As a result, small feral herds of Bactrian camels existed during the late 19th century in the southwest deserts of the United States.

=== Documentaries ===
* &quot;The Story of the Weeping Camel&quot; is a 2003 Mongolian documentary/story about a family of nomadic shepherds trying to get a white calf accepted by his mother, which rejected him after a difficult birth.

=== Military use ===
The Indian Army uses these camels to patrol in Ladakh. It was concluded that after carrying out trials and doing a comparative study with a single-humped camel brought from Rajasthan that the double-humped camel is better suited for the task at hand. Colonel Manoj Batra, a veterinary officer of the Indian Army, stated that the double-humped camel &quot;are best suited for these conditions. They can carry loads of at more than which is much more than the ponies that are being used as of now. They can survive without water for at least 72 hours.&quot;

<doc id="436254" wikidata="Q279397" url="?curid=436254" title="István Széchenyi">
<text>Count István Széchenyi de Sárvár-Felsővidék (, ; archaically English: Stephen Széchenyi; 21 September 1791 – 8 April 1860) was a Hungarian politician, political theorist, and writer. Widely considered one of the greatest statesmen in his nation&#x27;s history, within Hungary he is still known to many as &quot;the Greatest Hungarian&quot;.

== Family and early life ==
Széchenyi was born in Vienna to Count Ferenc Széchényi and Countess Juliána Festetics de Tolna; he was the youngest of their two daughters and three sons. The Széchenyis were an old and influential noble family of Hungary. Traditionally loyal to the House of Habsburg, they were linked with noble families, such as the Liechtenstein, the House of Esterházy and the House of Lobkowicz. István Széchenyi&#x27;s father was an enlightened aristocrat who founded the Hungarian National Museum and the Hungarian National Library. The boy spent his childhood both in Vienna and on the family estate of Nagycenk, Hungary.

== Military service in the Napoleonic Wars ==
After his private education, the young Széchenyi joined the Austrian army and participated in the Napoleonic Wars. He was seventeen years old when he entered the army. He fought with distinction at the battle of Raab (14 June 1809) and on 19 July brought about the subsequent junction of the two Austrian armies by conveying a message across the Danube to General Chasteler at the risk of his life.

Equally memorable was his famous ride, through the enemy&#x27;s lines on the night of 16–17 October 1813, to convey to Blücher and Bernadotte the wishes of the two emperors that they should participate in the battle of Leipzig on the following day, at a given time and place. In May 1815 he was transferred to Italy, and at the battle of Tolentino scattered Murat&#x27;s bodyguards by a dashing cavalry charge.

He left the service as a captain in 1826 (after his promotion to major was turned down) and turned his interest towards politics.

== Political career ==
From September 1815 to 1821, Széchenyi traveled extensively in Europe, visiting France, England, Italy, Greece and the Levant, and studying their institutions. He also established important personal connections. The rapid modernization of Britain fascinated him the most, and strongly influenced his thinking. He was also impressed with the Canal du Midi in France, and began to envision ways to improve navigation on the lower Danube and Tisza.

The Count quickly became aware of the growing gap between the modern world and his native Hungary. For the rest of his life, he was a determined reformer and promoted development. Széchenyi found early political support from his friend, Baron Miklós Wesselényi, a noble from Transylvania; however, their relation later weakened.

== The great reformer ==

Széchenyi gained a wider reputation in 1825, by supporting the proposal of the representative of Sopron county, Pál Nagy, to establish the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Széchenyi donated the full annual income of his estates that year, 60,000 forints, towards it. His example brought donations of 58,000 forint from three other wealthy nobles, and they gained Royal approval for the academy. He wanted to promote the use of the Hungarian language in this effort. S. became the Academy&#x27;s 1st Vice-president (the President being the Palatine). While the progress of Hungary &amp; its language was S.&#x27;s main point he aimed at greater things: In his 1st Vice-presidential address to the Academy he reminded his countrymen &quot;now that they have established their own Academy&quot; of their duty to support the other countries theoretically under the &quot;crown of St. Stephen&quot; [Croats, Czechs, Slovaks, etc.] in their own pursuits of &quot;sound nationalism&quot;. This was an important milestone in his life and for the reform movement.

In 1827, he organized the Nemzeti Kaszinó, or National Casino, a forum for the patriotic Hungarian nobility. The Casino had an important role in the reform movement by providing an institute for political dialogues.

To reach a wider public, Széchenyi decided to publish his ideas. His series of political writings, the &quot;Hitel&quot; (Credit, 1830), the &quot;Világ&quot;, (Light, 1831), and the &quot;Stádium&quot; (1833), addressed the Hungarian nobility. He condemned their conservatism and encouraged them to give up feudal privileges (e.g. free of taxation status), and act as the driving elite for modernization.

Széchenyi (with the help of Austrian ship&#x27;s company Erste Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft (DDSG) ), established the Óbuda Shipyard on the Hungarian Hajógyári Island in 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.

Széchenyi envisioned his program for Hungary within the framework of the Habsburg monarchy. He was convinced that Hungary initially needed a gradual economic, social and cultural development; he opposed both undue radicalism and nationalism. The latter he found particularly dangerous within the multi-ethnic Kingdom of Hungary, where people were divided by ethnicity, language and religion.

Besides his comprehensive political ideas, he concentrated on the development of transportation infrastructure, as he understood its importance for development and communication. Part of this program was the regulation of the flow of waters of the lower Danube to improve navigation, to open it to commercial shipping and trade from Buda to the Black Sea. 
He became the leading figure of the Danube Navigation Committee by the early 1830s, which completed its work in ten years. Previously the river had been dangerous for ships and was not efficient as an international trading route. Széchenyi was the first to promote steamboats on the Danube, the Tisza (Theiss), and Lake Balaton, also measures to open up Hungary to trade and development.

Recognizing the potential for the project for the region, Széchenyi successfully lobbied in Vienna to gain Austrian financial and political support. He was appointed as high commissioner and supervised the works for years. During this period, he traveled to Constantinople and built up relations in the Balkan area.

He wanted to develop Buda and Pest as a major political, economic and cultural center of Hungary. He supported the construction of the first permanent bridge between the two cities, the Chain Bridge. Besides its improving transportation connections, the Chain Bridge was a symbolic structure, foreshadowing the later unification of the two cities as Budapest, connected across rather than divided by the river.

== Marriage and family ==

In 1836 at the age of 45, Széchenyi married Countess Crescencia von Seilern und Aspang in Buda. They had three children:
* Júlia Széchenyi, who died at the age of three months
* Béla Széchenyi, who traveled to Eastern countries several times
* Ödön Széchenyi, who died as a Turkish pasha

Béla Széchenyi became known for his wide travels and explorations in the East Indies, Japan, China, Java, Borneo, western Mongolia, and the frontiers of Tibet. In 1893, he published an account of his experiences, written in German.

== Political rivalry with Kossuth ==
His relations with Lajos Kossuth were not good: he always thought Kossuth was a political agitator who overplayed his popularity. Széchenyi, although in a minority, continued to counsel for caution in the Diet and other meetings. In March 1848, he accepted the portfolio of ways and communications &quot;in the first responsible Magyar administration&quot; under Lajos Batthyány, but he feared the disruption of revolution.

=== &quot;Long debate&quot; of reformers in the press (1841–1848) ===
In his 1841 pamphlet &quot;People of the East&quot; (&quot;Kelet Népe&quot;), Count Széchenyi responded to Kossuth&#x27;s reform proposals. Széchenyi believed that economic, political and social reforms should proceed slowly and with care, to avoid the potentially disastrous prospect of violent interference from the Habsburg dynasty. Széchenyi was aware of the spread of Kossuth&#x27;s ideas in Hungarian society, which he took to overlook the need for a good relationship with the Habsburg dynasty.

Kossuth, for his part, rejected the role of the aristocracy, and questioned established norms of social status. In contrast to Széchenyi, Kossuth believed that in the process of social reform it would be impossible to restrain civil society in a passive role. He warned against attempting to exclude wider social movements from political life, and supported democracy, rejecting the primacy of elites and the government. In 1885, he labeled Széchenyi a liberal elitist aristocrat, while Széchenyi considered Kossuth to be a democrat.

Széchenyi was an isolationist politician, while Kossuth saw strong relations and collaboration with international liberal and progressive movements as essential for the success of liberty.

Széchenyi based his economic policy on the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; principles practiced by the British Empire, while Kossuth supported protective tariffs due to the comparatively weak Hungarian industrial sector. While Kossuth envisioned the construction of a rapidly industrialized country, Széchenyi wanted to preserve the traditionally strong agricultural sector as the main characteristic of the economy.

== Retreat from politics ==
The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 developed in the direction of Hungary attempting to break away from Habsburg rule, an attempt eventually crushed with severe repression by the Austrian authorities – both of which very much contrary to Széchenyi&#x27;s way of thinking and his vision for Hungary&#x27;s future. In early September 1848, Széchenyi&#x27;s nervous state brought depression and a breakdown; his doctor ordered him to the private Asylum of Dr. Gustav Görgen in Oberdöbling. With his wife&#x27;s care, he gradually recovered enough to resume writing but did not return to politics. He wrote the book &quot;Önismeret&quot; (Self awareness) about children, education and pedagogy. He also wrote &quot;Ein Blick&quot; (One Look), a study of the deep political problems of Hungary at the beginning of the 1850s.

== Death ==
Still suffering from depression, Széchenyi committed suicide by a gunshot to his head on 8 April 1860, at the age of 68. (8 April was the anniversary of the death of the Hungarian national hero Francis II Rákóczi, a century earlier). All Hungary mourned Széchenyi&#x27;s death. The academy was in official mourning, along with the most prominent persons of the leading political and cultural associations (including counts József Eötvös, János Arany, and Károly Szász). His rival Kossuth said he was &quot;the greatest of the Magyars&quot;.

* From 1884 to 1896, the Hungarian Academy published a nine-volume edition of his writings in Pest.

== Legacy and honors ==

* A statue of him was unveiled on 23 May 1880 in Budapest.
* Also in 1880, a statue commemorating him was unveiled in Sopron.
* In 1898, the chain bridge over the Danube was named &quot;Széchenyi Lánchíd&quot; &quot;Széchenyi Chain Bridge&quot; in his honour.
* In a survey by Median and Elemér Hankiss at the end of 2007, the Hungarian public ranked 1st &quot;greatest statesman of all time &quot; among Hungarian historical figures.
* In 2008, the István Széchenyi Chair in International Economics was privately endowed at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut, United States. In collaboration with Mathias Corvinus Collegium and Sapientia Hungarian University of Transilvania, the Chair oversees and develops three major academic programs to strengthen relations with Central Eastern Europe, especially Hungary: the Hungarian American Business Leaders (HABL), the QU executive MBA Trip in Hungary, and the Foreign Lecture Series.
* Since 1990, Széchenyi&#x27;s portrait has been featured on the 5000 Hungarian forint banknote, with a new design in 1999. 
* 2002, a Hungarian made-for-TV movie portrayed his life from 1820 to 1860; it is entitled &quot;&quot; (The Bridgeman) (in Hungarian).
* István Széchenyi Postage stamp was issued by Hungary on 1 July 1932 by honoring him in Famous Hungarians series of stamps.
* Another stamp in his honor was issued by Hungary on 3 May 1966; it shows the Chain Bridge in the backdrop of his portrait. A stamp of the face of István Széchenyi superimposed on the island of the Danube was issued by Hungary on 8 April 2016.
* Asteroid 91024 Széchenyi, discovered by astronomers Krisztián Sárneczky and László Kiss at the Piszkéstető Station in 1998, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 January 2008 ().

<doc id="436256" wikidata="Q1638587" url="?curid=436256" title="Ma'alot massacre">
<text>The Ma&#x27;alot massacre was a Palestinian terrorist attack that occurred on 14–15 May 1974 and involved the hostage-taking of 115 Israelis, chiefly school children, which ended in the murder of 25 hostages and six other civilians. It began when three armed members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) infiltrated Israel from Lebanon. Soon afterwards they attacked a van, killing two Israeli Arab women while injuring a third, and entered an apartment building in the town of Ma&#x27;alot, where they killed a couple and their four-year-old son. From there, they headed for the Netiv Meir Elementary School in Ma&#x27;alot, where in the early hours of 15 May 1974 they took hostage more than 115 people including 105 children. Most of the hostages were 14- to 16-years-old students from a high school in Safad on a pre-military Gadna field trip spending the night in Ma&#x27;alot. 

The hostage-takers soon issued demands for the release of 23 Palestinian militants and 3 others from Israeli prisons, or else they would kill the students. The Israeli side agreed, but the hostage-takers failed to get an expected coded message from Damascus. On 15 May, minutes before the 18:00 deadline set by the DFLP for killing the hostages, the Sayeret Matkal commandoes stormed the building. During the takeover, the hostage-takers killed children with grenades and automatic weapons. Ultimately, 25 hostages, including 22 children, were killed and 68 more were injured.

==Attack==
Ma&#x27;alot, located on a plateau in the hills of the Galilee region of Israel, south of the Lebanese border, is a development town founded in 1957 by Jewish immigrants, mainly from Morocco and Tunisia. The attack was carried out by three members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) dressed in Israel Defense Forces uniforms.

The DFLP terrorists infiltrated through the Nahal Mattat Nature Reserve from south of the Lebanese village of Rumaysh. The group entered Israel near Moshav Zar&#x27;it on Sunday night, 13 May. They were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, grenades, and plastic explosives of Czechoslovakian manufacture. They hid until the next night in the orchards near the Druze village of Hurfeish. A border patrol unit discovered their footprints but were unable to track them down.

Proceeding to Ma&#x27;alot up the winding road, the militants encountered a van driven by a Druze resident of Hurfeish bringing Arab Christian women from the village of Fassuta home from work at the ATA Textile Works in the Haifa Bay area. The leader of the militants, Linou, stood on the roadway and opened fire on the vehicle, instantly killing one woman, and wounding both the driver and other workers, one of whom later died of her wounds. The driver turned off the headlights and drove backward up the hill towards Moshav Tzuriel. Israeli soldiers were called to the scene but failed to catch them.

Reaching Ma&#x27;alot, the militants knocked on the doors of several homes. When they came to the home of Fortuna and Yosef Cohen, two of them who were Israeli-Arabs said in Hebrew that they were police searching for terrorists. When the door opened the militants burst in and killed the couple, their 4-year-old son Eliahu and wounded their 5-year-old daughter Miriam. Fortuna, seven months pregnant, tried to flee the intruders, but she was also shot. The only one in the family who survived unhurt was 16-month-old Yitzhak, a deaf-mute. From there, the militants headed for the Netiv Meir Elementary School where students on a school trip were lodged. On the way, they met Yaakov Kadosh, a sanitation worker, and asked for directions to the school. They then shot and injured him.

Netiv Meir Elementary School was a three-story concrete building with apartment buildings under construction nearby. The militants entered the building at 4 am, and took the 102 visiting teenage students hostage. The teenagers were spending the night in the school building as part of a three-day trip. They were students from a high school in Safad. Allegedly one of the parents of the slain teenagers had begged the headmaster to cancel the trip after learning that militants had entered the area. By then it was considered too late to cancel the trip because all the arrangements had been made. The militants had intended to lie in wait for children arriving the next day and had not expected to find so many students lodging there. Three of four teachers escaped by jumping through the window, and abandoned their 90 pupils, which created a great deal of bitterness among the parents. The teachers were immediately suspended from their posts by local authorities. 85 students and several teachers were held hostage. The students were forced to sit on the floor at gunpoint, with explosive charges between them.

In the morning the militants demanded the release from Israeli prisons of 23 Arab and three other prisoners, including Kozo Okamoto – a Japanese national involved in the 1972 Lod Airport massacre. Unless these conditions were met, they declared that they would kill the students. The deadline was set for 6:00 pm the same day.

At 10am 27-year-old Sylvan Zerach, at home on leave from the army, stood near the base of the tall concrete water tower not far from the school building to get a closer view of what was going on. One of the militants opened fire on him, hitting Zerach in the neck. Zerach later died in the hospital.

At an emergency session of the Knesset, a decision was reached to negotiate, but the hostage-takers turned down a request for more time.

===Takeover operation===
At 17:25 the commander of the elite Sayeret Matkal special forces group was given the &#x27;green light&#x27; to storm the building. The assault force was divided into three units; two to break in from the entrance while a third was to climb a ladder and enter from a window facing north. The squads moved into position from the blind side to the east, from the frames of some apartment buildings under construction. The operation was to have been coordinated with simultaneous sniper fire on the three hostage-takers. At 17:32 the first squad entered the building through the main entrance on the first floor, which was blocked with tables and chairs. The first three-man team, led by Yuval Galili of Kibbutz Geva, was hit by gunfire on the stairs leading to the second floor. Galili threw a phosphorus grenade into the second floor hallway to create a smokescreen. The smoke from the explosion blinded the second team led by Amiran Levine, which had been ordered to take out Linou, at that time posted at the third floor window where he had shot Zerach.

When they broke into the classroom where the students were being held, Harbi grabbed a student, Gabi Amsalem, and held him at gunpoint on the floor. Rahim was shot dead but Linou managed to reach the classroom, grab several magazines from the teacher&#x27;s desk and reload his weapon. He then sprayed the students with machinegun fire and tossed grenades out the window. When a burst of fire broke his left wrist, he threw two grenades at a group of girls huddled on the floor. Several students leaped from the windows to the ground, some below.

Beside the three DFLP militants, twenty-two high school students were killed in the attack and over fifty were wounded. The student victims were buried in their hometown, Safed. Some of the 10,000 mourners who attended the funerals chanted &quot;Death to the terrorists&quot;.

==Israeli response==
The next day Israel Defense Forces planes bombed offices and training bases of the DFLP and PFLP. According to a BBC report, the bombing inflicted damage in seven Palestinian refugee camps and villages in southern Lebanon killing at least 27 people and leaving 138 injured.

After an investigation Attorney General Meir Shamgar decided that the three teachers who escaped and abandoned their students had done no wrong. Parents of the victims angrily rejected the report.

The massacre led to the creation of the Yamam special police unit.

Amos Horev, President of Haifa&#x27;s Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, headed a Commission of Inquiry in May 1975 that investigated the massacre. The subsequent Commission Report listed a number of mistakes made by the government and security forces, and made several recommendations.

The DFLP tried a second time to take hostages at a hotel in Ma&#x27;alot in 1979, but were killed by Israeli soldiers.

==Commemoration==
In 2007, American filmmakers visited Ma&#x27;alot to film a documentary on the massacre. A memorial corner in the library of the Netiv Meir school displays photographs of the victims and archival footage on the massacre. A feature movie, &quot;Their Eyes Were Dry&quot;, retells the story of the massacre.

A Reform synagogue in southern California is named Shir Ha-Ma&#x27;alot (&quot;Song of Ascent&quot;) in memory of the victims.

<doc id="436261" wikidata="Q194291" url="?curid=436261" title="Sirimavo Bandaranaike">
<text>Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike (; ; 17 April 1916 – 10 October 2000), commonly known as Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was a Sri Lankan politician. She was the world&#x27;s first female prime minister when she became Prime Minister of Sri Lanka (then the Dominion of Ceylon) in 1960. She chaired the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) from 1960 to 1994 and served three terms as prime minister, two times as the chief executive, from 1960 to 1965 and from 1970 to 1977, and once again in a presidential system from 1994 to 2000, governing under the presidency of her daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga.

Born into a Sinhalese Kandyan aristocratic family, Bandaranaike was educated in Catholic, English-medium schools, but remained a Buddhist and spoke Sinhala as well as English. On graduating from secondary school, she worked for various social programmes before marrying and raising a family. Playing hostess to her husband S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, who founded the socialist SLFP in 1951 and became prime minister in 1956, she gained his trust as an informal advisor. Her social work focused on improving the lives of women and girls in rural areas of Sri Lanka.

Following her husband&#x27;s assassination in 1959, Bandaranaike was soon persuaded by the party leadership during a brief time in opposition to join active politics and succeed her husband as chairwoman; she returned her party to the government and defeated prime minister Dudley Senanayake&#x27;s UNP in the July 1960 election. She was then unseated by Senanayake in the 1965 election and became Leader of the Opposition, before winning a large majority in 1970 due to a cleverly structured election alliance with rival Marxist parties.

Bandaranaike attempted to reform the former Dominion of Ceylon into a socialist republic by nationalising organisations in the banking, education, industry, media and trade sectors. Changing the administrative language from English to Sinhala and routinely campaigning on Sinhalese nationalist and anti-Tamil policies, which was political mainstream, she exacerbated discontent among the native Tamil population, and with the estate Tamils, who had become stateless under the Citizenship Act of 1948.

During Bandaranaike&#x27;s first two terms as prime minister, the country was plagued by high inflation and taxes, a dependence on food imports to feed the populace, high unemployment, and polarisation between the Sinhalese and Tamil populations because of her Sinhalese nationalist policies. Surviving an attempted coup d&#x27;état in 1962, as well as a 1971 insurrection of radical youths, in 1972 she oversaw the drafting of a new constitution and the formation of the Sri Lankan republic, separating it from the British Empire and also extending the parliamentary period until 1977. In 1975, Bandaranaike created what would eventually become the Sri Lankan Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, also appointing the first woman to serve in the Sri Lankan Cabinet aside from herself. Bandaranaike&#x27;s tenure was marked by inadequate economic development at the national level. She played a large role abroad as a negotiator and a leader among the Non-Aligned Nations.

Losing against J. R. Jayewardene in a colossal landslide in the 1977 election and as the UNP government greatly reduced democratic rights, Bandaranaike was stripped of her civil rights in 1980 for claimed abuses of power during her tenure and barred from government for seven years, making her ineligible for the 1982 presidential election in the new presidential system. The new government initially improved the domestic economy, but failed to address social issues, and led the country into a protracted civil war against Tamil militants, which escalated in brutality over the years, especially when the Indian Peace Keeping Force was allowed to intervene. When she was allowed to return as a public figure in 1986, Bandaranaike opposed the Indian intervention, believing it violated Sri Lankan sovereignty.

Failing to win the office of President against new UNP leader Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1988, she restored her party, which had by now developed more centrist policies and advocated for a reconciliatory approach towards Tamils in the civil war, as a relevant force in the first parliamentary election after 12 years and served a second time as Leader of the Opposition from 1989 to 1994. When her daughter, who succeeded her as party leader, won the 1994 presidential election, Bandaranaike was appointed to her third term as prime minister and served until her retirement in 2000, two months prior to her death.

== Early life (1916–1940) ==
Bandaranaike was born Sirima Ratwatte on 17 April 1916 at Ellawala Walawwa, her aunt&#x27;s residence in Ratnapura, in British Ceylon. Her mother was Rosalind Hilda Mahawalatenne Kumarihamy, an informal Ayurvedic physician, and her father was Barnes Ratwatte, a native headman and politician. Her maternal grandfather Mahawalatenne, and later her father, served as Rate Mahatmaya, a native headman, of Balangoda. Her father was a member of the Radala Ratwatte family, chieftains of the Kingdom of Kandy. Her paternal ancestry included her uncle Sir Jayatilaka Cudah Ratwatte, the first person from Kandy to receive a British knighthood, as well as courtiers serving Sinhalese monarchs. One of these, Ratwatte, Dissawa of Matale, was a signatory of the 1815 Kandyan Convention.

Sirima was the eldest in a family of six children. She had four brothers, Barnes Jr., Seevali, Mackie, and Clifford, and one sister, Patricia, who married Colonel Edward James Divitotawela, founder of the Central Command of the Ceylon Army. The family resided at the walawwa, or colonial manor house, of Sirima&#x27;s maternal grandfather Mahawalatenne, and then later at their own walawwa in Balangoda. From a young age, Sirima had access to her grandfather&#x27;s vast library of literary and scientific works. She first attended a private kindergarten in Balangoda, moved briefly in 1923 to the primary classes of Ferguson High School in Ratnapura, and was then sent to boarding school at St Bridget&#x27;s Convent, Colombo. Though her education was in the Catholic school system, Sirima remained a practising Buddhist throughout her life and was fluent in both English and Sinhala.

After completing her schooling at age 19, Sirima Ratwatte became involved in social work, distributing food and medicine to jungle villages, organising clinics and helping create rural industry to improve the living standards of village women. She became the treasurer of the Social Service League, serving in that capacity until 1940. Over the next six years, she lived with her parents while they arranged her marriage. After rejecting two suitors – a relative, and the son of the first family of Ceylon – Ratwatte&#x27;s parents were contacted by a matchmaker who proposed a union with Solomon West Ridgeway Dias (S.W.R.D.) Bandaranaike, an Oxford-educated lawyer-turned-politician, who was at the time Minister of Local Administration in the State Council of Ceylon. Initially, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was not considered to be from an &quot;acceptable&quot; family, as the Ratwattes were an aristocratic Kandyan family, which had inherited their service to the traditional royal family, while the Bandaranaikes were a wealthy family from the low-country, which had been in service of the colonial rulers for centuries. Astrologers reported their horoscopes were compatible, the benefits of uniting the families was weighed, and approval was given by the Ratwatte family. The couple, who had previously met, were in agreement with the choice.

== Raising a family, social work (1940–1959) ==

On 2 October 1940, Ratwatte and Bandaranaike married at the Mahawelatenne Walawwa in what was dubbed &quot;the wedding of the century&quot; by the press for its grandeur. The newly married couple moved into &quot;Wendtworth&quot; in Colombo&#x27;s Guildford Crescent, which they rented from Lionel Wendt. Their daughters, Sunethra (1943) and Chandrika (1945), were born at &quot;Wendtworth&quot; where the family lived until 1946, when S.W.R.D.&#x27;s father bought them a mansion known as &quot;Tintagel&quot; at Rosmead Place in Colombo.

From this point onward, the family lived part of the year at &quot;Tintagel&quot; and part of the year at S.W.R.D.&#x27;s ancestral manor, Horagolla Walawwa. A son, Anura was born at &quot;Tintagel&quot; in 1949. Over the next 20 years, Sirima Bandaranaike devoted most of her time to raising her family and playing hostess to her husband&#x27;s many political acquaintances.

All three of Bandaranaike&#x27;s children were educated abroad. Sunetra studied at Oxford, Chandrika at the University of Paris, and Anura at the University of London. All would later return and serve in the Sri Lankan government.

In 1941 Bandaranaike joined the &quot;Lanka Mahila Samiti&quot; (Lankan Women&#x27;s Association), the country&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s voluntary organisation. She participated in many of the social projects initiated by the &quot;Mahila Samiti&quot; for the empowerment of rural women and disaster relief. One of her first projects was an agricultural programme to meet food production shortages. Her first office, as secretary of the organisation, involved meeting with farming experts to develop new methods for producing yields of rice crops. Over time, Bandaranaike served as the treasurer, vice-president, and eventually president of &quot;Mahila Samiti&quot;, focusing on issues of girls&#x27; education, women&#x27;s political rights, and family planning. She was also a member of the All Ceylon Buddhist Women&#x27;s Association, the Cancer Society, the Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, and the Nurses Welfare Association.

Bandaranaike often accompanied S.W.R.D. on official trips, both locally and abroad. She and her husband were both present after the psychiatric hospital in Angoda was bombed by the Japanese during the Easter Sunday Raid in 1942, killing many. As Ceylon moved toward self-governing status in 1947, S.W.R.D. became more active in the nationalist movement. He ran for – and was elected to – the House of Representatives from the Attanagalla Electoral District. He was appointed Minister of Health and served as Leader of the House, but became increasingly frustrated with the inner workings and policies of the United National Party. Though he did not encourage Bandaranaike to engage on political topics and was dismissive of her in front of colleagues, S.W.R.D. came to respect her judgment.

In 1951, she persuaded him to resign from the United National Party and establish the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Freedom Party, aka SLFP). Bandaranaike campaigned in S.W.R.D.&#x27;s Attanagalla constituency during the 1952 parliamentary election, while he travelled around the country to garner support. Though the Freedom Party won only nine seats during that election, S.W.R.D. was elected to Parliament and became Leader of the Opposition.

When fresh elections were called in 1956 by Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala, S.W.R.D. sensed an opportunity and formed the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), a broad four-party coalition, to contest the 1956 elections. Bandaranaike once again campaigned for her husband in Attanagalla, in her home town of Balangoda, and in Ratnapura for the Freedom Party. The Mahajana Eksath Peramuna won a landslide victory and S.W.R.D. became the prime minister.

While on a state visit to Malaysia on its Independence in 1957, the couple had to cut short their stay when they received news that Bandaranaike&#x27;s father was gravely ill following a heart attack. He died two weeks after their hasty return.

Bandaranaike was at home in Rosmead Place on the morning of 25 September 1959, when S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was shot multiple times by a Buddhist monk, disgruntled over what he believed to be lack of support for traditional medicine. Bandaranaike accompanied her husband to hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds the following day.

In the political chaos that followed under the caretaker government of Wijeyananda Dahanayake, many cabinet ministers were removed, and some were arrested and tried for the assassination. The Mahajana Eksath Peramuna coalition collapsed without S.W.R.D.&#x27;s influence, and elections were called for March 1960 to fill the seat for the Attanagalla constituency. Bandaranaike reluctantly agreed to run as an independent candidate, but before the election could be held, Parliament was dissolved, and she decided not to contest the seat. When the election was held in March 1960, the United National Party won a four-seat majority over the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Dudley Senanayake, the new prime minister, was defeated within a month in a vote of confidence and a second general election was called for July 1960.

== Political career ==
In May 1960, Bandaranaike was unanimously elected party president by the executive committee of the Freedom Party, although at the time she was still undecided about running in the July election. Disavowing former party ties with Communists and Trotskyists, by early June she was campaigning with promises to carry forward the policies of her husband – in particular, establishing a republic, enacting a law to establish Sinhala as the official language of the country, and recognising the predominance of Buddhism, though tolerating the estate Tamils&#x27; use of their own language and Hindu faith.

Though there had been Tamil populations in the country for centuries, the majority of the estate Tamils had been brought to Ceylon from India by the British authorities as plantation workers. Many Ceylonese viewed them as temporary immigrants, even though they had lived for generations in Ceylon. With Ceylon&#x27;s independence, the Citizenship Act of 1948 excluded these Indian Tamils from citizenship, making them stateless. S.W.R.D.&#x27;s policy toward the stateless Tamils had been moderate, granting some citizenship and allowing productive workers to remain. His successor, Dudley Senanayake, was the first to recommend compulsory repatriation for the population. Bandaranaike toured the country and made emotional speeches, frequently bursting into tears as she pledged herself to continue her late husband&#x27;s policies. Her actions earned her the title &quot;The Weeping Widow&quot; from her opponents.

=== First female Prime Minister (1960–1965) ===

On 21 July 1960, following a landslide victory for the Freedom Party, Bandaranaike was sworn in as the first female prime minister in the world, as well as Minister of Defence and External Affairs. As she was not an elected member of parliament at the time, but leader of the party holding the majority in parliament, the constitution required her to become a member of Parliament within three months if she was to continue holding office as prime minister. To make a place for her, Manameldura Piyadasa de Zoysa resigned his seat in the Senate. On 5 August 1960, Governor General Goonetilleke appointed Bandaranaike to the Senate of Ceylon, the upper house of Parliament.

Initially, she struggled to navigate the issues facing the country, relying on her cabinet member and nephew, Felix Dias Bandaranaike. Opponents made dismissive comments about her &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;: she would continue to face similar sexism while in office.

To further her husband&#x27;s policy of nationalising key sectors of the economy, Bandaranaike established a corporation with public-private shareholders, taking control of seven newspapers. She nationalised banking, foreign trade, and insurance, as well as the petroleum industry. In taking over the Bank of Ceylon and establishing branches of the newly created People&#x27;s Bank, Bandaranaike aimed to provide services to communities with no previous banking facilities, spurring local business development.

In December 1960, Bandaranaike nationalised all the parochial schools that were receiving state funding. In doing so she curtailed the influence of the Catholic minority, who tended to be members of the economic and political elite, and extended the influence of Buddhist groups.

In January 1961, Bandaranaike implemented a law making Sinhala the official language, replacing English. This action caused wide discontent among the more than two million Tamil-speakers. Urged on by members of the Federal Party, a campaign of civil disobedience began in the provinces with Tamil majorities. Bandaranaike&#x27;s response was to declare a state of emergency and send in troops to restore peace.

Beginning in 1961, trade unions began a series of strikes in protest of high inflation and taxes. One such strike immobilised the transport system, motivating Bandaranaike to nationalise the transport board.

In January 1962, conflicts erupted between the established elites: the predominantly right-wing Westernized urban Christians – including large contingents of Burghers and Tamils – and the emerging native elite, who were predominantly leftist Sinhala-speaking Buddhists. The changes caused by Bandaranaike&#x27;s policies created an immediate shift away from the Anglophilic class system, power structures, and governance, significantly influencing the composition of the officer corps of the civil service, armed forces, and the police.
Some military officers plotted a coup d&#x27;état, which included plans to detain Bandaranaike and her cabinet members at the Army Headquarters. When the police official Stanley Senanayake was taken into the confidence of the coup leadership, his father-in-law Patrick de Silva Kularatne informed the IGP. Immediately calling all service commanders and junior officers to an emergency meeting at Temple Trees, Felix Dias Bandaranaike and members of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) began questioning the military personnel and uncovered the plot.

Because the coup was aborted before it began, the trial process for the 24 accused conspirators was lengthy and complex. The retroactive &quot;Criminal Law Special Provision Act of 1962&quot;, which allowed consideration of hearsay evidence, was passed to aid in the conviction of the plotters. Though rumours circulated against Sir Oliver Goonatillake, the governor general, there was no real evidence against him and therefore no means of prosecuting him. He was neither &quot;removed from office nor did he resign&quot;. He agreed to answer questions about his suspected involvement once he was replaced. In February Bandaranaike&#x27;s uncle, William Gopallawa was appointed Governor General. Goonatillake was escorted to the airport, left Ceylon, and went into voluntary exile.

In an attempt to balance east–west interests and maintain neutrality, Bandaranaike strengthened the country&#x27;s relationship with China, while eliminating ties with Israel. She worked to maintain good relationships with both India and Russia, while keeping ties to British interests through the export of tea and supporting links with the World Bank. Condemning South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policy, Bandaranaike appointed ambassadors to and sought relationships with other African nations. In 1961, she attended both the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in London and the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia making Sri Lanka one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.

She was a key player in reducing tensions between India and China after their 1962 border dispute erupted into the Sino-Indian War. In November and December of that year, Bandaranaike called conferences in Colombo with delegates from Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Ghana and the United Arab Republic to discuss the dispute. She then travelled with Ghanaian Justice Minister Kofi Ofori-Atta to India and Peking, China in an attempt to broker peace. In January 1963, Bandaranaike and Orofi-Atta were rewarded in New Delhi, when Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian Prime Minister, agreed to make a motion in the Indian Parliament recommending the settlement Bandaranaike had advocated for.

At home, difficulties were mounting. Despite her success abroad, Bandaranaike was criticised for her ties with China and lack of economic development policies. Tensions were still high over the government&#x27;s apparent favouritism of Sinhala-speaking Ceylonese Buddhists. The import-export imbalance, compounded by inflation, was impacting the buying power of middle- and lower-class citizens. In the mid-year by-election, although Bandaranaike held a majority, the United National Party made gains, indicating that her support was slipping.

Lack of support for austerity measures, specifically the inability to import adequate rice – the main dietary staple – caused the resignation of Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike. Other cabinet ministers were reassigned in an attempt to stem the drift toward Soviet trade partnerships, which had gained ground after the creation of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The Petroleum Corporation had been launched in 1961 to bypass the monopolistic pricing imposed on Middle Eastern oil imports, allowing Ceylon to import oil from the United Arab Republic and the Soviet Union. Some of the storage facilities of western oil operatives were co-opted with a compensation agreement, but continuing disputes over non-payment resulted in suspension of foreign aid from the United States in February 1963. In reaction to the suspension of aid, the Parliament passed the &quot;Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Amendment Act&quot; nationalising all distribution, import-export, sales and supply of most oil products in the country, from January 1964.

Also in 1964, Bandaranaike&#x27;s government abolished the independent Ceylon Civil Service and replaced it with the Ceylon Administrative Service, which was subject to government influence. When the United Left Front coalition between the Communist, Revolutionary Socialist and Trotskyist Parties was formed in late 1963, Bandaranaike moved left to try to gain their support. In February 1964, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited Bandaranaike in Ceylon with offers of aid, gifts of rice and textiles, and discussions to extend trade. The two also discussed the Sino-Indian border dispute and nuclear disarmament. The ties with China were attractive, as Bandaranaike&#x27;s recent formal recognition of East Germany had eliminated incoming aid from West Germany and her nationalisation of the insurance industry had impacted her relationships with Australia, Britain and Canada.

In preparation for the second Non-Aligned Conference, Bandaranaike hosted presidents Tito and Nasser in Colombo in March 1964, but continued domestic unrest caused her to suspend parliamentary sessions until July. In the interim, she entered into a coalition with the United Left Front and was able to shore up her majority, though only by a margin of three seats.
In September 1964 Bandaranaike led a delegation to India to discuss the repatriation of the 975,000 stateless Tamils residing in Ceylon. Along with Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, she ironed out the terms of the Srimavo-Shastri Pact, a landmark agreement for the foreign policy of both nations. Under the agreement, Ceylon was to grant citizenship to 300,000 of the Tamils and their descendants while India was to repatriate 525,000 stateless Tamils. During the 15 years allotted to complete their obligations, the parties agreed to negotiate terms for the remaining 150,000. In October, Bandaranaike attended and co-sponsored the Non-Aligned Conference held in Cairo.

In December 1964, her United Front government put forward the &quot;Press Take Over Bill&quot; in an attempt to nationalise the country&#x27;s newspapers. The opposition and Bandaranaike&#x27;s critiques claimed that the move was to muzzle a free press and strike at her major critic, the Lake House Group led by the press baron Esmond Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe responded with a campaign to remove her from office to safeguard the freedom of the press. On 3 December 1964, C. P. de Silva, who was at one time S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike&#x27;s deputy, led thirteen SLFP parliamentarians and crossed over to the opposition citing the Press Take Over Bill. The government of Sirima Bandaranaike lost the throne speech by one vote and a general election was called for in March 1965. Her political coalition was defeated in the 1965 elections, ending her first term as prime minister.

=== Leader of the opposition (1965–1970) ===
In the 1965 elections, Bandaranaike won a seat in the House of Representatives from the Attanagalla Electoral District. With her party gaining 41 seats, she became the Leader of the Opposition, the first woman ever to hold the post. Dudley Senanayake was sworn in as prime minister on 25 March 1965.

Soon after, Bandaranaike&#x27;s position as a member of parliament was challenged, when allegations were made that she had accepted a bribe, in the form of a car, while in office. A committee was appointed to investigate and she was later cleared of the charge.

During her five-year term in the opposition, she maintained her alliance with leftist parties. Of the seven by-elections held between November 1966 and April 1967, six were won by the opposition under Bandaranaike&#x27;s leadership. Continued inflation, trade imbalance, unemployment, and the failure of expected foreign aid to materialise led to widespread discontent. This was further fuelled by austerity measures, which reduced the weekly rice stipend. By 1969, Bandaranaike was actively campaigning to return to power. Among other pledges, she promised to give two measures of rice per household, nationalise foreign banks and the import-export industry, establish watchgroups for monitoring business and government corruption, return to a foreign policy which leaned away from &quot;imperialist&quot; partners, and hold a Constituent Assembly charged with drafting a new Constitution.

===Second term (1970–1977)===
Bandaranaike regained power after the United Front coalition between the Communist Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and her own Freedom Party won the 1970 elections with a large majority in May 1970. By July, she had convened a Constitutional Assembly to replace the British-drafted constitution with one drafted by the Ceylonese. She introduced policies requiring that permanent secretaries in the government ministries have expertise in their division. For example, those serving in the Ministry of Housing had to be trained engineers, and those serving in the Ministry of Health, medical practitioners. All government employees were allowed to join Workers Councils and at the local level and she established People&#x27;s Committees to allow input from the population at large on government administration. The changes were intended to remove elements of British colonial and foreign influence from the country&#x27;s institutions.

Facing budget deficits of $195 million – caused by rising energy and food-importation costs and declining revenue from coconut, rubber and tea exports – Bandaranaike attempted to centralise the economy and implement price controls. Pressed by the leftist members of her coalition to nationalise the foreign banks of British, Indian and Pakistani origin, she realised that doing so would impact the need for credit. As she had in her previous regime, she tried to balance the flow of foreign assistance from both capitalist and communist partners.

In September 1970, Bandaranaike attended the third Non-Aligned Conference in Lusaka, Zambia. That month, she also travelled to Paris and London to discuss international trade. Ordering representatives of The Asia Foundation and the Peace Corps to leave the country, Bandaranaike began re-evaluating trade agreements and proposals that had been negotiated by her predecessor. She announced that her government would not recognise Israel until the country peacefully settled its problem with its Arab neighbours. She officially granted recognition to East Germany, North Korea, North Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Bandaranaike opposed the development of an Anglo-US communications centre in the Indian Ocean, maintaining that the area should be a &quot;neutral, nuclear-free zone&quot;. In December, the Business Undertaking Acquisition Act was passed, allowing the state to nationalise any business with more than 100 employees. Ostensibly, the move aimed to reduce foreign control of key tea and rubber production, but it stunted both domestic and foreign investment in industry and development.


Despite Bandaranaike&#x27;s efforts to address the country&#x27;s economic problems, unemployment and inflation remained unchecked. After just 16 months in power, Bandaranaike&#x27;s government was almost toppled by the 1971 Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Insurrection of left-wing youths. Though aware of the militant stance of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People&#x27;s Liberation Front), Bandaranaike&#x27;s administration initially failed to recognise them as an imminent threat, dismissing them as idealists.

On 6 March, militants attacked the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, leading to the declaration of a state of emergency on 17 March. In early April, attacks on police stations evidenced a well-planned insurgency which Ceylon&#x27;s small army was ill-equipped to handle. Calling on its allies for assistance, the government was saved largely because of Bandaranaike&#x27;s neutral foreign policy. The Soviet Union sent aircraft to support the Ceylonese government; arms and equipment came from Britain, the United Arab Republic, the United States and Yugoslavia; medical supplies were provided by East and West Germany, Norway and Poland; patrol boats were sent from India; and both India and Pakistan sent troops. On 1 May, Bandaranaike suspended government offensives and offered an amnesty, which resulted in thousands of surrenders. The following month a second amnesty was offered. Bandaranaike established a National Committee of Reconstruction to re-establish civil authority and provide a strategic plan for dealing with those captured or surrendered insurgents. One of the Bandaranaike&#x27;s first actions after the conflict was to expel North Korean diplomats, as she suspected they had fomented the radical discontent. The saying &quot;&quot;She was the only man in her cabinet&quot; –&quot; attributed to her political opponents in the 1960s – resurfaced during the height of the insurgency, as Bandaranaike proved that she had become a &quot;formidable political force&quot;.

In May 1972, Ceylon was replaced by the Republic of Sri Lanka after a new Constitution was ratified. Though the country remained within the Commonwealth of Nations, Queen Elizabeth II was no longer recognised as its sovereign. Under its terms, the Senate, suspended since 1971, was officially abolished and the new unicameral National State Assembly was created, combining the powers of the executive, judicial and legislative branches in one authority.

The constitution recognised the supremacy of Buddhism, though it guaranteed equal protection to Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. It failed to provide a charter of inalienable rights, recognised Sinhala as the only official language, and contained no &quot;elements of federalism&quot;.

The new constitution also extended Bandaranaike&#x27;s term by two years, resetting the mandated five-year term of the prime minister to the coincide with the creation of the republic. These limits caused concern for various sectors of the population, specifically those who were uneasy about authoritarian rule, and the Tamil-speaking population. Before the month was out, the discontent escalated before leading to the passage of the Justices Commission Bill, establishing separate tribunals to deal with the imprisoned insurgents from the previous year. Those in opposition to the tribunals argued that they were a violation of the principles of human rights. By July, sporadic incidents of violence were resurfacing, and by the end of the year, a second wave of revolt was anticipated. Widespread unemployment fuelled the public&#x27;s growing disillusionment with the government, in spite of land redistribution programmes enacted to establish farming cooperatives and limit the size of privately held lands.

In 1972, Bandaranaike introduced major land reforms in Sri Lanka, with the enactment of the &quot;Land Reform Act of No. 01 of 1972&quot; which imposed a ceiling of twenty hectares on privately owned land, this was later followed up by the Land Reform (Amendment) Act in 1975 that nationalized plantations owned by public companies. The objective of these land reforms were to grant lands to landless peasants. Critiques claimed that the second wave of reforms were targeted the wealthy landowners that had traditionally supported the United National Party. As a result of these reforms the state became the largest plantation owner and two entities, the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation, the Janatha Estate Development Board (People&#x27;s Estate Development Board) and the USAWASAMA (Upcountry Cooperative Estate Development Board) were established to manage these estates. In the years following these land reforms, the production of the key export crops which Sri Lanka depended on for the in follow of foreign currency dropped.

The 1973 oil crisis had a traumatic effect on the Sri Lankan economy. Still dependent on foreign assistance, goods and monetary aid from Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Hungary, and the World Bank, Bandaranaike eased the austerity programmes that limited importation of consumer goods. The United States terminated aid grants, which required no repayment, and changed to a policy of providing foreign loans. Devaluation of the Sri Lankan currency, coupled with inflation and high taxes, slowed economic growth, consequently creating cyclical pressure to address deficits with even higher taxes and austerity measures. Uncontrolled inflation between 1973 and 1974 led to economic uncertainty and public dissatisfaction.

In 1974, Bandaranaike forced the shut-down of the last independent newspaper group, &quot;The Sun&quot;, believing their criticism was fuelling unrest. Fissures appeared in the United Front coalition, largely resulting from the Lanka Sama Samaja Party&#x27;s continued influence on trade unions and threats of strike actions throughout 1974 and 1975. When newly confiscated estates were placed under the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, controlled by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, fears that they would unionise plantation workers led Bandaranaike to oust them from the government coalition.

In recognition of International Women&#x27;s Year in 1975, Bandaranaike created an agency to focus on women&#x27;s issues, which would later become the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. She appointed the first woman to serve in the Sri Lankan Cabinet, Siva Obeyesekere, first as First State Secretary for Health and later as Minister of Health. She was feted at the UN World Conference on Women hosted in Mexico City, attending as the only woman prime minister elected in her own right. Bandaranaike stepped into the one-year term of chair at the 5th Conference of the Non-Aligned Nations in 1976, hosting the meeting in Colombo.

Despite her high regard internationally, she continued to struggle domestically under allegations of corruption and nepotism, while the economy continued to decline. In their struggle for recognition, discontented Tamils turned to separatism. In May 1976, the Vaddukoddai Resolution was adopted by the Tamil United Liberation Front, calling for independent statehood and sovereign autonomy. In the 1977 general elections, the United Front was soundly defeated, winning only six seats.

===Party leader (1977–1988)===
Bandaranaike retained her parliamentary seat in Attanagalla in the 1977 general elections. In November 1977, a petition challenging her position as a member of parliament was dismissed by the Colombo High Court. In 1978, a new constitution was ratified, replacing the British-style parliamentary system with a French-style presidential system. Under the constitution, the executive or President, was elected by a vote of the people to serve a six-year term. The president then chose a prime minister to preside over the Cabinet, who was confirmed by the legislature. Providing a declaration of fundamental rights, guaranteeing the equality of citizens for the first time, it also recognised Tamil as a national language, though the administrative language remained Sinhala. Though aimed at appeasing Tamil separatists, the provisions did not stop the violence between Tamils and Sinhalese, resulting in the passage of the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act.

In 1980, a Special Presidential Commission was appointed by President J. R. Jayawardene to investigate allegations against Bandaranaike for abuses of power during her tenure as prime minister. Following the submission of the report to Jayawardene, the United National Party government adopted a motion in parliament on 16 October 1980 to strip Bandaranaike and her nephew, Felix Dias Bandaranaike – who was convicted of corruption – of their civil liberties for a period of seven years. She was expelled from parliament, but maintained her role as party leader. The motion passed by 139 votes in favour and 18 against, easily meeting the required two-thirds threshold.

Despite being its head, Bandaranaike was unable to campaign for the Freedom Party. As a result, her son, Anura served as the parliamentary party leader. Under Anura the Freedom Party moved to the right, and Bandaranaike&#x27;s daughter, Chandrika, withdrew, forming the Sri Lanka People&#x27;s Party with her husband, Vijaya Kumaratunga. The goals of the new party were related to rapprochement with the Tamils.

From 1980, conflict between the government and separatists of various competing groups, including the Tamil Tigers, the People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil Eelam Liberation Army, and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization, became more frequent and increasingly violent. During local election campaigning in 1981, Tamil extremists assassinated Arumugam Thiagarajah, a prominent United National Party politician. The Tamil United Liberation Front Party called for a boycott of the 1982 presidential elections. Insurgents supported the ban, as they contended that co-operation with the government legitimised its policies and conflicted with the desire for attaining an independent Tamil state.

In 1983 insurgent Tamils ambushed an army patrol, killing thirteen soldiers. Retaliatory violence by Sinhalese mobs sparked riots against non-insurgent Tamils and their property throughout the country, later referred to as Black July.

Jayewardene&#x27;s move towards free markets and a focus on economic growth hurt Tamil farmers in the north by removing trade protections. Similarly, the policies negatively impacted not only southern Sinhalese businesses facing competition from Indian markets, but also the urban poor, whose food subsidies were greatly reduced. Massive government spending for economic development created budget deficits and inflation, alarming the World Bank and International Monetary Fund administrators. In turn, donor agencies reduced aid to persuade the government to control spending. Acceleration of the Mahaweli Development programme increased employment and stabilised the food supply, also reducing dependence on foreign energy supplies with the completion of four hydropower-generating facilities.

The focus on building the economy and infrastructure failed to address social issues. For example, the rural housing initiative – which built some 100,000 new homes by 1984 – polarised communities because housing was distributed by political alliance rather than need. Privatization of industry, after 1982, created significant gaps between the rich and poor and inflation returned, making goods hard to procure and lowering the standard of living.

In January 1986, Bandaranaike&#x27;s civil rights were restored by a presidential decree issued by Jayewardene. The conflict between the government and the separatists, which had escalated since 1983, morphed into a Civil War by 1987.

Jayewardene showed little sympathy for the issues of concern to the Tamils and instead blamed the unrest on left-wing factions plotting a government overthrow. Breakdowns in negotiations with the rebels eventually led Jayewardene to authorise the intervention of the Indian Government. Signed in 1987, &quot;The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord&quot; laid out terms of the truce between the Sri Lankan Government and the rebels, authorising the Indian Peace Keeping Force to occupy the country in an attempt to promote disarmament.

Bandaranaike and the Freedom Party opposed the introduction of Indian troops, believing the government had betrayed its own people by allowing India to intervene on behalf of the Tamils. As a reaction to state-sanctioned violence and their desire for nationalist focus, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna militants re-emerged in the south. Against this backdrop, Bandaranaike decided to run in the 1988 presidential election. She was narrowly defeated by Ranasinghe Premadasa, who succeeded Jayewardene as president.

===Leader of the opposition (1989–1994)===

On 6 February 1989, while campaigning for the Freedom Party in the 1989 general election, Bandaranaike survived a bombing attack. Though she was unscathed, one of her aides suffered leg injuries. In the final results on the 19th, the Freedom Party was defeated by the United National Party under Ranasinghe Premadasa, but gained 67 seats, sufficient for Bandaranaike to take up the post of Leader of the Opposition for a second term. She was successfully re-elected to parliament in the Gampaha Electoral District. The same year, the government crushed the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna rebels, killing some 30,000 to 70,000 of them, rather than opting for trials or imprisonment as Bandaranaike had done in 1971.

In 1990, when the 13-month ceasefire was broken by the Tamil Tigers, after other militias surrendered their weapons, the government decided to break off negotiations with the Tigers and employ a military solution. Anura supported the move, but his mother, Bandaranaike, spoke against the plan. When emergency powers were assumed by the president, she demanded that the state of emergency be lifted, accusing the government of human rights abuses.

During her tenure as opposition leader, she supported the impeachment of Premadasa in 1991, which was led by senior United National Party members such as Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake. The impeachment failed, as Premadasa adjourned Parliament and the Speaker M. H. Mohamed dismissed the motion for impeachment, stating there were not enough signatures supporting it. Bandaranaike&#x27;s daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga, who had been living in self-imposed exile in London since 1988, when her husband had been assassinated, returned to Sri Lanka and rejoined the Freedom Party in 1991. In the same year, Bandaranaike, who was increasingly impaired by arthritis, suffered a stroke.

In 1992, Premadasa Udugampola, head of the Bureau of Special Operations, was forced to retire after an international outcry over human rights abuse surfaced. Udugampola provided a written statement that the death squads used against rebels had been backed by the government. Bandaranaike came out in support of his evidence, but Udugampola was charged for cultivating public hostility against the government. When President Premadasa was assassinated by a suicide bomber on 1 May 1993, his Prime Minister Dingiri Banda Wijetunga was sworn as acting president and nominated to complete the president&#x27;s unexpired term until 2 January 1995. The members of Parliament were required to vote on the succession within a month. Due to her failing health, Bandaranaike chose not to run for the presidency, but to continue as opposition leader, and Wijetunga ran unopposed.

Wijetunga convinced Bandaranaike&#x27;s son, Anura, to defect to the United National Party and rewarded him with an appointment as Minister of Higher Education. His defection left Bandaranaike and Kumaratunga in charge of the Freedom Party. Due to her mother&#x27;s declining health, Kumaratunga led the formation of a new coalition, the People&#x27;s Alliance (PA), to contest the 1993 provincial election in the Western Province of Sri Lanka in May. The alliance won a landslide victory, and Kumaratunga was appointed as the chief minister in 1993. Subsequently, the coalition led by Kumaratunga also won the southern provincial council elections. Kumaratunga led the People&#x27;s Alliance campaign for the 1994 parliamentary election, as her mother was recovering from surgery. The Alliance won a decisive victory, and Bandaranaike announced that Kumaratunga would become prime minister. By this time Kumaratunga had also succeeded her as the leader of the Freedom Party. Mentally alert but suffering from a foot ailment and complications from diabetes, Bandaranaike was confined to a wheelchair. Having been re-elected to parliament, she was appointed to her daughter&#x27;s cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio at the swearing-in ceremony held on 19 August 1994.

===Third term (1994–2000)===
In the presidential election that followed in November, Kumaratunga&#x27;s main political rival, Gamini Dissanayake, was assassinated two weeks before the election. His widow, Srima Dissanayake, was chosen as the United National Party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Kumaratunga&#x27;s lead was predicted to be around a million votes even before the assassination; she won the election by a wide margin. Becoming the first female President of Sri Lanka, Kumaratunga appointed her mother as prime minister, which under the terms of the 1978 constitution meant Bandaranaike was responsible for defence and foreign affairs. Though the office of prime minister had become mainly a ceremonial post, Bandaranaike&#x27;s influence in the Freedom Party remained strong. While they agreed on policy, Kumaratunga and Bandaranaike differed on leadership style. By 2000, Kumaratunga wanted a younger prime minister, and Bandaranaike, citing health reasons, stepped down in August 2000.

==Death and legacy==

Bandaranaike died on 10 October 2000 of a heart attack at Kadawatha, as she was heading home to Colombo. She had been casting her vote in the parliamentary election, which had been held that day. Sri Lanka declared two days of national mourning, and state radio stations abandoned their regular programming to play funeral laments. Bandaranaike&#x27;s remains lay in state in the parliament, and her funeral subsequently took place at Horagolla, where she was interred in the mausoleum, Horagolla Bandaranaike Samadhi, originally built for her husband.

At a time in history when the idea of a woman leading a country was almost unthinkable to the public, Bandaranaike helped raise the global perception of women&#x27;s capabilities. In addition to her own contributions to Sri Lanka, her children became involved in the development of the country. All three children held nationally prominent positions; in addition to Anura and Chandrika&#x27;s roles in government, Bandaranaike&#x27;s daughter Sunetra worked as her political secretary in the 1970s and later became a philanthropist. The Bandaranaike marriage helped break down social barriers in Sri Lanka over the years, through the Socialist policies they enacted.

During her three terms in office, Bandaranaike led the country away from its colonial past and into its political independence as a republic. Implementing socialist policies during the Cold War, she attempted to nationalise key sectors of the economy and undertake land reforms to benefit the native population, desiring to end the political favouritism enjoyed by the Western-educated elites. A major goal of her policies was to reduce the ethnic and socio-economic disparities in the country, though her failure to address adequately the needs of the Tamil population led to decades of strife and violence in the country. As one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bandaranaike brought Sri Lanka to prominence among the nations which sought to remain neutral to the influence of the superpowers. She worked to forge alliances between the countries in the Global South, and sought to resolve issues diplomatically, opposing nuclear expansion.

Despite Bandaranaike&#x27;s notability as the world&#x27;s first woman prime minister, political scholars have commented that Bandaranaike was symbolically powerful, but ultimately had little impact on women&#x27;s political representation in Sri Lanka. Although Bandaranaike expressed pride in her status as a woman leader, considering herself a &quot;Mother of the People&quot;, she did not place much personal or political emphasis on women&#x27;s issues, and her election as prime minister did not significantly increase the number of women in Sri Lankan politics. Her appointment of the first woman minister, Siva Obeyesekere, to the Sri Lankan Cabinet in 1976, was less than revolutionary due to the fact that Obeyesekere was a relative of Bandaranaike&#x27;s. That appointment followed a pattern of Bandaranaike appointing family members to high government positions.

By 1994, even though Bandaranaike and her daughter Kumaratunga held the top political positions of prime minister and president, Sri Lanka continued to have some of the lowest political participation rates for women out of any Asian country. In 2010, on the 50th anniversary of Bandaranaike&#x27;s election as the world&#x27;s first female prime minister, Sri Lankan parliamentarian Rosy Senanayake told the press that Sri Lanka had not made significant progress towards gender equality in politics: only 4.5 per cent of parliamentarians were women. Senanayake had earlier called for a &quot;special quota&quot; to achieve better gender representation: such a quota, reserving 25% of all legislative seats for women, was passed in 2016.

In 2023, a documentary film chronicling her life story, titled &quot;Our Mother, Grandmother, Prime Minister: Sirimavo&quot;, was released. The film is portrayed through conversations with her two daughters, Sunethra and Chandrika, as well as two of her grandchildren. The film also contains personal accounts from long-standing members of the Ceylon Administrative Service, who were part of her cabinet. It won Best Documentary at the 21st Dhaka International Film Festival.

<doc id="436283" wikidata="Q1500106" url="?curid=436283" title="Rosegarden">
<text>Rosegarden is a free software digital audio workstation program developed for Linux with ALSA, JACK and Qt4. It acts as an audio and MIDI sequencer, scorewriter, and musical composition and editing tool. It is intended to be a free alternative to such applications as Cubase.

Software synthesizers are available as a plugin, and it is possible to use external MIDI synthesizer, hardware or software (such as FluidSynth, TiMidity++ or Yoshimi) in order to make any sound from MIDI compositions. Recent versions of Rosegarden support the DSSI software synthesizer plugin interface and can use some Windows VST plugins through an adapter. As of version 24.12 LV2 plugin beta support is provided. Connection to software synths is provided via ALSA MIDI.

== History ==
The current Rosegarden program was originally named Rosegarden-4, to distinguish it from a previous program by the same authors called Rosegarden 2.1, which is now known as X11 Rosegarden. X11 Rosegarden is very limited but is stable on a wide variety of Unix-like operating systems and other platforms such as OpenVMS. In contrast, because Rosegarden(-4) uses the Linux ALSA system, it only runs in a very limited manner on non-Linux systems.

The Rosegarden project was started in 1993 at the University of Bath. Rosegarden 2.1 (X11 Rosegarden) was released under the GPL in 1997; Rosegarden(-4) began in April 2000. Version 1.0 was released on February 14, 2005, and version 1.2.4 on July 14, 2006. In 2010, The version numbering was changed to reflect the release year, starting with 10.02.

== Developers ==
Rosegarden was developed up through 1.0 by Chris Cannam, Richard Bown and Guillaume Laurent. Since then, each release has been developed by a different mix of core and contributing project members, including, but not limited to D. Michael McIntyre, Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas, and Heikki Junes. Bown has retired from the project, while Laurent has left to pursue his interest in porting to Mac OS X via Cocoa in an as yet unnamed spinoff project. As of 2023 Ted Felix has been leading development and releases with substantial support from Philip Leishman and other contributors.

<doc id="436287" wikidata="Q5691531" url="?curid=436287" title="Heaps' law">
<text>In linguistics, Heaps&#x27; law (also called Herdan&#x27;s law) is an empirical law which describes the number of distinct words in a document (or set of documents) as a function of the document length (so called type-token relation). It can be formulated as

:formula_1

where &quot;VR&quot; is the number of distinct words in an instance text of size &quot;n&quot;. &quot;K&quot; and β are free parameters determined empirically. With English text corpora, typically &quot;K&quot; is between 10 and 100, and β is between 0.4 and 0.6.

The law is frequently attributed to Harold Stanley Heaps, but was originally discovered by . Under mild assumptions, the Herdan–Heaps law is asymptotically equivalent to Zipf&#x27;s law concerning the frequencies of individual words within a text. This is a consequence of the fact that the type-token relation (in general) of a homogenous text can be derived from the distribution of its types.

Empirically, Heaps&#x27; law is preserved even when the document is randomly shuffled, meaning that it does not depend on the ordering of words, but only the frequency of words. This is used as evidence for deriving Heaps&#x27; law from Zipf&#x27;s law.

Heaps&#x27; law means that as more instance text is gathered, there will be diminishing returns in terms of discovery of the full vocabulary from which the distinct terms are drawn.

Deviations from Heaps&#x27; law, as typically observed in English text corpora, have been identified in corpora generated with large language models.

Heaps&#x27; law also applies to situations in which the &quot;vocabulary&quot; is just some set of distinct types which are attributes of some collection of objects. For example, the objects could be people, and the types could be country of origin of the person. If persons are selected randomly (that is, we are not selecting based on country of origin), then Heaps&#x27; law says we will quickly have representatives from most countries (in proportion to their population) but it will become increasingly difficult to cover the entire set of countries by continuing this method of sampling.
Heaps&#x27; law has been observed also in single-cell transcriptomes considering genes as the distinct objects in the &quot;vocabulary&quot;.

<doc id="436290" wikidata="Q914054" url="?curid=436290" title="Louis Leon Thurstone">
<text>Louis Leon Thurstone (May 29, 1887 – September 29, 1955) was an American pioneer in the fields of psychometrics and psychophysics. He conceived the approach to measurement known as the law of comparative judgment, and is well known for his contributions to factor analysis. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Thurstone as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth.

== Early life and career ==
Thurstone was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Swedish immigrant parents. His family returned to Stockholm, Sweden, when he was eight years old, before returning to the United States in 1901, settling in Jamestown, New York. Thurstone originally received a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1912. Thurstone was offered a brief assistantship in the laboratory of Thomas Edison. In 1914, after two years as an instructor of geometry and drafting at the University of Minnesota, he enrolled as a graduate student in psychology at the University of Chicago (PhD, 1917). He later returned to the University of Chicago (1924–1952) where he taught and conducted research; among his students was James Watson, who co-discovered the structure of DNA. 1952, he established the L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

== Factor analysis and work on intelligence ==
Thurstone was responsible for the standardized mean and standard deviation of IQ scores used today, as opposed to the Intelligence Test system originally used by Alfred Binet. He is also known for the development of the Thurstone scale.

Thurstone&#x27;s work in factor analysis led him to formulate a model of intelligence centered on &quot;Primary Mental Abilities&quot; (PMAs), which were independent group factors of intelligence that different individuals possessed in varying degrees. He opposed the notion of a singular general intelligence that factored into the scores of all psychometric tests and was expressed as a mental age. In 1935 Thurstone, together with EL Thorndike and JP Guilford, founded the journal &quot;Psychometrika&quot; and also the Psychometric Society, going on to become the society&#x27;s first president in 1936. Thurstone&#x27;s contributions to methods of factor analysis have proved valuable in establishing and verifying later psychometric factor structures, and have influenced the hierarchical models of intelligence in use in intelligence tests such as WAIS and the modern Stanford-Binet IQ test.

The seven primary mental abilities in Thurstone&#x27;s model were &quot;verbal comprehension&quot;, &quot;word fluency&quot;, &quot;number facility&quot;, &quot;spatial visualization&quot;, &quot;associative memory&quot;, &quot;perceptual speed&quot;, and &quot;reasoning&quot;.

== Contributions to measurement ==
Despite his contributions to factor analysis, Thurstone (1959, p. 267) cautioned: &quot;When a problem is so involved that no rational formulation is available, then some quantification is still possible by the coefficients of correlation of contingency and the like. But such statistical procedures constitute an acknowledgement of failure to rationalize the problem and to establish functions that underlie the data. We want to measure the separation between the two opinions on the attitude continuum and we want to test the validity of the assumed continuum by means of its internal consistency&quot;. Thurstone&#x27;s approach to measurement was termed the law of comparative judgment. He applied the approach in psychophysics, and later to the measurement of psychological values. The so-called &#x27;Law&#x27;, which can be regarded as a measurement model, involves subjects making a comparison between each of a number of pairs of stimuli with respect to magnitude of a property, attribute, or attitude. Methods based on the approach to measurement can be used to estimate such scale values.

Thurstone&#x27;s Law of comparative judgment has important links to modern approaches to social and psychological measurement. In particular, the approach bears a close conceptual relation to the Rasch model (Andrich, 1978), although Thurstone typically employed the normal distribution in applications of the Law of comparative judgment whereas the Rasch model is a simple logistic function. Thurstone anticipated a key epistemological requirement of measurement later articulated by Rasch, which is that relative scale locations must &#x27;transcend&#x27; the group measured; i.e. scale locations must be invariant to (or independent of) the particular group of persons instrumental to comparisons between the stimuli. Thurstone (1929) also articulated what he referred to as the &quot;additivity criterion&quot; for scale differences, a criterion which must be satisfied in order to obtain interval-level measurements.

== Awards and honors ==
Thurstone received numerous awards, including: Best Article, American Psychological Association (1949); Centennial Award, Northwestern University (1951); Honorary Doctorate, University of Göteborg (1954). Thurstone was President of American Psychological Association (1933) and first President of the American Psychometric Society (1936). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1938, and the American Philosophical Society in 1938.

<text>The Ruwer is a river in Germany with a length of . It is a right tributary of the Moselle. The valley of the Ruwer is a part of the Moselle wine-growing region near Trier in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its Riesling wines, see Ruwer (region), and, prior to 1 August 2007, the Moselle region used to be known as &quot;Moselle-Saar-Ruwer&quot;.

In the lower Ruwer valley are the villages of Waldrach, Kasel, Mertesdorf, Eitelsbach and Ruwer.

== History ==
The Roman city of Trier (Augusta Treverorum) was supplied with water by the Roman Ruwer Aqueduct, which delivered up to 25,000 cubic metres per day.

In A.D. 371, the Ruwer was mentioned by the Roman poet, Ausonius, in his poem, &quot;Mosella&quot; as follows: &quot;The Ruwer turns the corn-grinding millstones in giddy whirls and draws the shrieking saws through smooth marble blocks.&quot;

==Tributaries==
Other tributaries of the Ruwer include the Apfelbach, Borgraben, Eitelsbach, Gusterather Waschbach, Kundelbach, Labach, Moertschelbach, Rimperterbach, Wenigbach, Wenzelbach and the Wilzenburger Waschbach.

== Mills ==
There are, or were, several water mills in the Ruwer region:

&quot;Mühlscheider Hof&quot; in Kahlbach,
Schillingen Mill Lehbach,
Niederkell Mill,
&quot;Unterste Mühle&quot; at Burkelsbach,

<doc id="436303" wikidata="Q10360338" url="?curid=436303" title="Cownose ray">
<text>The cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) is a species of Batoidea found throughout a large part of the western Atlantic and Caribbean, from New England to southern Brazil (the East Atlantic populations are now generally considered a separate species, the Lusitanian cownose ray (&quot;R. marginata&quot;)). These rays also belong to the order Myliobatiformes, a group that is shared by bat rays, manta rays, and eagle rays.

Cownose rays prefer to live in shallower, coastal waters or estuaries. Size, lifespan, and maturity differ between male and female rays. Rays have a distinct shape, and it has two lobes at the front of its head, resembling a cow nose. Cownose rays can live between 16 and 21 years, depending on sex. Rays feed upon organisms with harder shells, such as clams, crustaceans, or mollusks. They are migratory creatures, where they migrate South in the winter and North in the summer. The rays are known to occupy the Chesapeake Bay in the summer months.

In 2019, the species was listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The species has been subjected to overfishing due to the perceived threat of overpopulation in the Chesapeake Bay. There are not many conservation strategies or efforts for cownose rays.

==Taxonomy ==
The genus name &quot;Rhinoptera&quot; is named for the Ancient Greek words for nose (&#x27;) and wing (&#x27;). The species name &quot;bonasus&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek for bison ().

== Description ==
A cownose ray is typically brown-backed with a slightly white or yellow belly. Although its coloration is not particularly distinctive, its shape is easily recognizable. It has a broad head with wide-set eyes, and a pair of distinctive lobes on its subrostral fin. It also has a set of dental plates designed for crushing clams and oyster shells. Male rays often reach about in width, while females typically reach about in width. The cownose ray is often mistaken for being a shark by beach-goers due to the tips of the rays&#x27; fins sticking out of the water, often resembling the dorsal fin of a shark.

When threatened the cownose ray can use the barb at the base of its tail to defend itself from the threat. A cownose ray has a spine with a toxin, close to the ray&#x27;s body. This spine has teeth lining its lateral edges, and is coated with a weak venom that causes symptoms similar to that of a bee sting.

== Habitat and distribution==
Cownose rays are migratory and social creatures and reside on the east coast of the United States, Brazil, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. They prefer to live in near coastal waters and in estuarian ecosystems. Cownose rays are able to tolerate a wide range of salinities because of the areas they occupy. This allows for the rays to have the potential to live in a wider range of habitats if one area gets too crowded and competition for resources is high. Cownose rays are known to be abundant in the Chesapeake Bay and migrate to the area for mating and nursery purposes, typically in the late spring and summer time. Rays are typically spotted near the surface of waters as well.

==Behavior==

=== Diet and feeding ===
The cownose ray exhibits a durophagous diet, meaning it feeds upon hard-shelled organisms, such as mollusks, crustaceans, but they prefer scallops or clams, which have softer shells and are categorized as bivalves. The cownose ray tends to feed either in the early morning hours or in the late afternoon hours, when the waves are calm and visibility is higher than during the day. Their feeding occurs in the benthic zone, or at the bottom of the ocean.

The rays are able to capture their prey through suction and the opening and closing of their jaw. Because of the type of prey cownose rays consume, their jaw needs to be able to handle the hard-shell organisms. Their jaws are extremely robust and have teeth with a hardness comparable to that of cement. Their cephalic lobes also assist with capturing and handling their prey by pushing them towards their mouth.

=== Predation ===
The cownose ray sits fairly high up on the food chain, and as a result only has a few natural predators. These predators include; cobia, hammerhead sharks, and humans who like to fish for them.

=== Reproduction and lifespan ===
Cownose rays breed from April through October. Rays will not reach a mature age until they are roughly 70% of the way to their maximum size. Females reach maturity between ages 7–8, while males reach maturity between ages 6–7. The lifespan of the cownose ray varies by sex; the oldest female ray that has been recorded was 21, and the oldest male ray was 18, which were both observed in the Chesapeake Bay.

Cownose rays are ovoviviparous, meaning that the embryo grows within its mother until it is ready to hatch. Rays have a longer gestation period due to their K-selected species attributes. The length of gestation is believed to last between 11 and 12 months, and at full term, the offspring are born live, exiting tail first.

=== Migration ===
Rays often travel and migrate in large schools based on size and sex. Their migration pattern consists of rays moving north in late Spring and moving south in late Fall. Much of what we know about their migration has been from studies done in the Chesapeake Bay. Male and female rays will come to the Bay in the late spring and leave in the fall. While occupying the Chesapeake Bay, the female rays and her pups will live in the estuarine waters. Males have been observed leaving the Bay earlier than the females to arrive at a second feeding ground, and the reason for taking a longer migration route is not fully known. One hypothesis is that males exit the Bay to reduce competition of certain resources, such as food and shelter.

== Threats and conservation ==
The cownose ray is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List due to extensive overfishing and commercial fishing. The overfishing is due to the perception that rays destroy oyster beds meant for the shellfish industry.

The trophic cascade in the northwest Atlantic Ocean has been cited and used to link cownose ray overpopulation to the decrease in large coastal sharks, which therefore cause bivalves populations valuable for commercial reasons to be depleted; however, there is little evidence that supports this hypothesis. Campaigns such as &quot;Save the Bay, Eat a Ray&quot; in the Chesapeake Bay used these claims to promote the fishery of these rays in hopes of preserving the Bay, which can be detrimental to this species. Cownose rays reach a mature age later in their lifecycle and long gestation periods, meaning that they are a K-selected species. This suggests that they are vulnerable and sensitive to overfishing, and their populations cannot easily bounce back after these events. Even though rays have been used as a scapegoat to explain the decline in bivalves, some studies have found that cownose rays do not consume a great deal of oysters or clams. Other studies have found that much of the shellfish prey that the cownose ray consumes is influenced by the size of the shell, so it has been suggested that oyster growers protect their shellfish until their shell reaches a certain size.

There are not many conservation strategies or efforts for cownose rays, besides the fact that cownose ray killing contests have been banned in the state of Maryland.

== Relationship to humans ==

=== Risk to humans ===
Stingrays, including the cownose ray, can pose a low to moderate risk to humans. Rays will lash their tails when threatened, posing a risk of being whipped. If threatened, the cownose ray can also use their barb as a weapon to sting the aggressor. A sting from a cownose ray can cause a very painful wound that requires medical attention once stung. While the sting is not usually fatal, it can be fatal if stung in the abdomen. There is also a risk associated with eating meat from the sea animal that has not been prepared correctly. Shigella may be acquired from eating meat from a cownose ray that has been contaminated with the bacteria. This bacteria causes shigellosis, and can result in dysentery. Symptoms can include diarrhea, pain, fever, and possible dehydration.

=== Aquariums ===

Cownose rays can be seen in many public aquaria worldwide and are often featured in special &#x27;touch tanks&#x27; where visitors can reach into a wide but shallow pool containing the fish, which have often had their barbs pinched or taken off (they eventually regrow, similar to human nails), making them safe enough to touch.

<text>Francisco Sebastián Carvajal y Gual, sometimes spelled Carbajal (9 December 1870 – 30 September 1932) was a Mexican lawyer and politician who served briefly as president in 1914, during the Mexican Revolution. In his role as foreign minister, he succeeded Victoriano Huerta as president upon the latter&#x27;s resignation.

==Biography==
Born in 1870 in Campeche, Carvajal studied jurisprudence. He occupied important positions in the administration of President Porfirio Díaz. On May 3, 1911, Díaz named him as his representative at the peace conference with constitutionalist rebel Francisco I. Madero. In 1913, after Victoriano Huerta had seized power from Madero, Huerta named him president of the Supreme Court. Later (10 July 1914), Huerta named him to the cabinet as foreign minister. When Huerta resigned on 15 July, Carvajal was legally next-in-line to the presidency.

During his month-long presidential term, he oversaw the transfer of power to Venustiano Carranza and his Constitutionalist Army under the terms of the Teoloyucan Treaties. Carvajal left office on August 13, 1914; Carranza gained de facto control of the executive the following year, despite not being formally elected to the Presidency until 1917.

Carvajal left for the United States. In New Orleans, he met and married Louise Martin. They had one child, Francisco Carvajal, on October 19, 1918. He returned to Mexico City in 1922 to take up his legal profession again and died there on September 20, 1932.

<text>The Kiss (also known as The May Irwin Kiss, The Rice-Irwin Kiss and The Widow Jones) is an 1896 short film, and was one of the first films ever shown commercially to the public. Around 18 seconds long, it depicts a re-enactment of the kiss between May Irwin and John Rice from the final scene of the stage musical &quot;The Widow Jones.&quot; The film was directed by William Heise for Thomas Edison. The film was produced in April 1896 at the Edison Studios of Edison, the first film studio in the United States. At the time, Edison was working at the Black Maria studios in West Orange, New Jersey.

In 1999, the short was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Cast==
* May Irwin as Widow Jones
* John Rice as Billie Bikes

==Production==
The film was one of the last shot at Edison&#x27;s Black Maria.

==Release==
According to Charles Musser the film was released in either April or May 1896, and was publicized in a sponsored article in the &quot;New York World&quot; about actors kissing on stage. The article discussed the controversy surrounding onstage kissing and, along with an illustration of the Irwin and Rice kiss, referred readers to &quot;The Widow Jones&quot; and the Edison film. The campaign sought to bring attention to the newspaper, play, and movie all at once. The film was shown during demonstrations of the Vitascope.

Charles Frohman was initially against the film, stating that &quot;I shall have to consider replacing Miss Irwin&quot; in &quot;The Widow Jones&quot;, but then asked for Edson Raff to have advertising for the short include that Irwin was the star of &quot;The Widow Jones&quot;.

The film was sold to exhibitors for $7.50 ($232 in 2020) and it was being shown at the end of almost every show by the fall of 1896.

==Reaction==
The film contained the very first kiss on film, with a close-up of a nuzzling duo followed by a short peck on the lips (&quot;the mysteries of the kiss revealed&quot;). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and obscene to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform, as kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.

The film caused a scandalized uproar and occasioned disapproving newspaper editorials and calls for police action in many places where it was shown. One contemporary critic wrote, &quot;The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other&#x27;s lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting.&quot;

However, according to Dengler (1979) in the &quot;Journal of Popular Film and Television&quot;, the shocked reaction of the general public is a myth.

The Edison catalogue advertised it this way: &quot;They get ready to kiss, begin to kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss in a way that brings down the house every time.&quot;
Perhaps in defiance, and &quot;to spice up a film&quot;, this was followed by many kiss imitators and take-offs, including &quot;Something Good – Negro Kiss&quot; (1898), &quot;The Kiss in the Tunnel&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1900).

==Public exposure==
For a number of years, it was believed that a showing of &quot;The Kiss&quot; was the first film publicly shown in Canada, projected in West End Park, Ottawa, on July 21, 1896. It has since been learned that the competing Lumière Brothers Cinematograph had already exhibited different films in Montreal 24 days earlier, on June 27, 1896.

<text>The Widow Jones is a musical comedy created by the writer John J. McNally as a star vehicle for the actress and singer May Irwin. The musical used song material in &quot;Negro dialect&quot; by a variety of songwriters. Premiering at the Boston Museum theatre and backed by the Boston producers Rich &amp; Harris, the play toured in cities through the United States in 1895-1896; including two separate runs at Broadway&#x27;s Bijou Theatre. The work is best remembered today for its Act 1 kiss scene which was re-created by Irwin with her co-star John C. Rice as a short film in Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;The Kiss&quot; in 1896.

==Plot==
Irwin portrays Beatrice Byke an un-married &quot;fat-fair-and-forty&quot; woman who has run away to Maine and assumed the false identity of a widow going by the surname Jones in order to avoid her many ardent suitors. Over the course of the play she is forced to pay the bills of her false husband, a man who allegedly died from drowning, only to eventually come face to face with the supposedly drowned man.

==Performances and Edison film==
&quot;The Widow Jones&quot; premiered at the Boston Museum on September 2, 1895, and then went on tour for performances in cities throughout the United States. Part of this tour included performances at Broadway&#x27;s Bijou Theatre where it began its run on September 16, 1895. The production left New York City to perform on tour, but ultimately returned for more performances at the Bijou Theatre beginning on March 16, 1896. On April 21, 1896 at the Bijou Theatre the show&#x27;s producer&#x27;s, Rich &amp; Harris of Boston, presented Irwin with a custom made silver perfume bottle and a plaque to celebrate the production&#x27;s 300th performance given during the production&#x27;s run (not all on Broadway, but collectively).

Thomas Edison hired the play&#x27;s stars, May Irwin and John Rice, to recreate the kiss seen in act 1 of the play for the 1896 short film, &quot;The Kiss&quot;, made in Edison&#x27;s Kinetoscope process. The film was acquired by the Film Library of the Museum of Modern Art in 1935.

<text>The Telegraph is an Indian English daily newspaper founded and continuously published in Kolkata since 7 July 1982. It is published by the ABP Group and competes with the Middle-market newspaper &quot;The Times of India&quot;. The newspaper is the eighth most-widely read English language newspaper in India as per &quot;Indian Readership Survey&quot; (IRS) 2019.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; has three editions Kolkata, South Bengal and North Bengal.

==History==
&quot;The Telegraph&quot; was founded on 7 July 1982. The design director of London&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Edwin Taylor, designed the newspaper and provided a standard in design and editing. In 31 years, it has become the largest-circulation English daily in the eastern region published from Kolkata. In 1982, M. J. Akbar used to edit and design the daily newspaper; thus it had a major impact on newspaper journalism in India.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; is published by media group Ananda Publishers closely associated with ABP Pvt. Ltd; the group also published &quot;Anandabazar Patrika&quot; (a Bengali language newspaper) since 13 March 1922. Apart from newspapers the group even published Bengali and English periodicals like &quot;Anandamela&quot;, &quot;Unish-Kuri&quot;, &quot;Sananda&quot;, &quot;Anandalok&quot;, &quot;Desh magazine&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph in Schools&quot; and &quot;Career&quot;.

&quot;Businessworld&quot;, which was initially part of the ABP group, has been sold to Anurag Batra, of Exchange4Media and Vikram Jhunjhunwala, an investment banker for an undisclosed amount.

The paper currently has three editions Calcutta, South Bengal and North Bengal. Previous editions include Northeast edition (Guwahati split), Jharkhand edition (Jamshedpur and Ranchi splits), Patna and Bhubaneshwar editions. Bhubaneshwar &amp; Patna Editions ceased on 14 December 2018 and Northeast and Jharkhand editions on 20 May 2020.

== Editorial stance ==
According to an analysis of the major English language newspapers in India, during the run up to the 2014 Indian general election, the political coverage of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; was found to be less aligned in favor of the Bharatiya Janata Party and less negative of the Indian National Congress relative to that of &quot;The Times of India&quot; and the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;.

In a 2020 &quot;Newslaundry&quot; article, the paper&#x27;s coverage of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the central government and that of the Bengal government were contrasted; according to it the paper provided more critical coverage of the former and less of the latter in its editorials and frontpage headlines. In an interview to &quot;Outlook&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; editor R. Rajagopal rejected the conception that it was harsher on the former and soft of the latter, stating that the scope of the events decide the prominence they receive in the paper which is being noticed because only a few others are providing similar coverage and that the tendency among media outlets to seek a false balance just to be able to claim neutrality was detrimental to journalism.

==Criticism==
In 2016, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, in its edition took a jibe at the then HRD Minister Smriti Irani, who gave a speech on nationalism in the Lok Sabha, by calling her &quot;Aunty National&quot;. This incident was widely criticized by many, who described the usage of such term as &#x27;sexist&#x27; and &#x27;misogynistic&#x27;. The News Minute wrote, &quot;Smriti Irani deserves all the criticism we can cobble up together, but for her politics and policies. Personal attacks based on her age and gender do not bode well, and contribute to debasing the discourse on important issues. What we are perhaps forgetting is that in adopting such an acrimonious discourse against those who threaten our liberalism, and by cheering-on such headlines, we are threatening the very idea of the liberalism that we want to foster.

In 2020, The Press Council of India issued a show-cause notice to the editor of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; for its frontpage headline for the news report about former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi&#x27;s nomination to the Rajya Sabha. In its frontpage headline, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;Kovind, not Covid, did it&quot; – a reference to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a press release, the Press Council said &quot;satirical comments ridiculing and denigrating the first citizen of the country is uncalled for and beyond the call of fair journalistic content&quot;.

&quot;The Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; headline, comparing the president to a virus, was also called out for being &#x27;disrespectful&#x27; to Dalits. Guru Prakash, Assistant Professor (Law), Patna University and Adviser at Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (DICCI), said in a piece in India Today that the headline was &quot;indicative of the deep-seated caste-based prejudice of the establishment&quot;. He added, &quot;The establishment entails the ones who control and dominate the narrative in academia and the media.&quot;

According to Tarun Ganguly, a former bureau chief at &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, the idea behind such headlines is to be &#x27;catchy&#x27;. Another former editor of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; states that such headlines started when Aveek Sarkar was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper. He added that Sarkar preferred a &#x27;shock-factor&#x27; and thought these would generate more impact.

<doc id="436324" wikidata="Q1189395" url="?curid=436324" title="PhyloCode">
<text>The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature, known as the PhyloCode for short, is a formal set of rules governing phylogenetic nomenclature. Its current version is specifically designed to regulate the naming of clades, leaving the governance of species names up to the rank-based nomenclature codes (&quot;ICN&quot;, &quot;ICNCP&quot;, &quot;ICNP&quot;, &quot;ICZN&quot;, &quot;ICVCN&quot;).

The &quot;PhyloCode&quot; is associated with the International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature (ISPN). The companion volume, Phylonyms, establishes 300 taxon names under &quot;PhyloCode&quot;, serving as examples for those unfamiliar with the code. RegNum is an associated online database for registered clade names.

The &quot;PhyloCode&quot; regulates phylogenetic nomenclature by providing rules for deciding which associations of names and definitions are considered established, which of those will be considered homonyms or synonyms, and which one of a set of synonyms or homonyms will be considered accepted (generally the one registered first; see below). The &quot;PhyloCode&quot; only governs the naming of clades, not of paraphyletic or polyphyletic groups, and only allows the use of specimens, species, and apomorphies as specifiers (anchors).

==Phylogenetic nomenclature==
Unlike rank-based nomenclatural codes (&quot;ICN&quot;, &quot;ICZN&quot;, &quot;ICNB&quot;), the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; does not require the use of ranks, although it does optionally allow their use. The rank-based codes define taxa using a rank (such as genus, family, etc.) and, in many cases, a type specimen or type subtaxon. The exact content of a taxon, other than the type, is not specified by the rank-based codes.

In contrast, under phylogenetic nomenclature, the content of taxa are delimited using a definition that is based on phylogeny (i.e., ancestry and descent) and uses specifiers (e.g., species, specimens, apomorphies) to indicate actual organisms. The formula of the definition indicates an ancestor. The defined taxon, then, is that ancestor and all of its descendants. Thus, the content of a phylogenetically defined taxon relies on a phylogenetic hypothesis.

The following are examples of types of phylogenetic definition (capital letters indicate specifiers):
* Node-based: &quot;the clade originating with the most recent common ancestor of A and B&quot; or &quot;the least inclusive clade containing A and B&quot;
* Branch-based: &quot;the clade consisting of A and all organisms or species that share a more recent common ancestor with A than with Z&quot; or &quot;the most inclusive clade containing A but not Z.&quot; Another term for definitions of this sort is stem-based.
* Apomorphy-based: &quot;the clade originating with the first organism or species to possess apomorphy M inherited by A&quot;.
Other types of definition are possible as well, taking into account not only organisms&#x27; phylogenetic relations and apomorphies but also whether or not related organisms are extant.

The following table gives examples of phylogenetic definitions of clades that also have ranks in traditional nomenclature. When all the specifiers in a node-based definition are extant specimens or species, as in the following definition of Mammalia, a crown group is defined. (The traditional definition of Mammalia is less restrictive, including some fossil groups outside of the crown group.) 
==Versions==

&quot;PhyloCode&quot; has gone through several revisions. , the current version is 6, released on the website on June 8, 2020.

==Organization==

As with other nomenclatural codes, the rules of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; are organized as articles, which in turn are organized as chapters. Each article may also contain notes, examples, and recommendations.

===Table of contents===
* Preface (including Literature Cited)
* Preamble
* Division I. Principles
* Division II. Rules
** Chapter I. Taxa (Arts. 1–3)
** Chapter II. Publication (Arts. 4–5)
** Chapter III. Names (Arts. 6–8)
** Chapter IV. Clade Names (Arts. 9–11)
** Chapter V. Selection of Established Names (Arts. 12–15)
** Chapter VI. Provisions for Hybrids (Art. 16)
** Chapter VII. Orthography (Arts. 17–18)
** Chapter VIII. Authorship of Names (Art. 19)
** Chapter IX. Citation of Authors and Registration Numbers (Art. 20)
** Chapter X. Species Names (Art. 21)
** Chapter XI. Governance (Art. 22)
* Glossary
* Appendices
** Appendix A. Registration Procedures and Data Requirements
** Appendix B. Code of Ethics

==Registration database==

Once implemented, the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; will be associated with a registration database, called RegNum, which will store all clade names and definitions that will be considered acceptable. It is hoped that this will provide a publicly usable tool for associating clade names with definitions, which could then be associated with sets of subtaxa or specimens through phylogenetic tree databases (such as TreeBASE).

As currently planned, however, the most important use of RegNum will be the decision of which one of a number of synonyms or homonyms will be considered accepted: the one with the lowest registration number, except in cases of conservation.

==History==

(Condensed from the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;&#x27;s Preface.)

The &quot;PhyloCode&quot; grew out of a workshop at Harvard University in August 1998, where decisions were made about its scope and content. Many of the workshop participants, together with several other people who subsequently joined the project, served as an advisory group. In April 2000, a draft was made public on the web and comments were solicited from the scientific community.

A second workshop was held at Yale University in July 2002, at which some modifications were made in the rules and recommendations of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;. Other revisions have been made from time to time as well.

The First International Phylogenetic Nomenclature Meeting, which took place from July 6, 2004, to July 9, 2004, in Paris, France, was attended by about 70 systematic and evolutionary biologists from 11 nations. This was the first open, multi-day conference that focused entirely on phylogenetic nomenclature, and it provided the venue for the inauguration of a new association, the International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature (ISPN). The ISPN membership elects the Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature (CPN), which has taken over the role of the advisory group that oversaw the earlier stages of development of the PhyloCode.

The Second International Phylogenetic Nomenclature Meeting took place from June 28, 2006, to July 2, 2006, at Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.).

The Third International Phylogenetic Nomenclature Meeting took place from July 21, 2008, to July 22, 2008, at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada).

The PhyloCode went into effect with the publication of the companion volume, &quot;Phylonyms&quot;, in 2020.

===Influences===

The theoretical foundation of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; was developed in a series of papers by de Queiroz and Gauthier, which was foreshadowed by earlier suggestions that a taxon name could be defined by reference to a part of a phylogenetic tree.

Whenever possible, the writers of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; used the draft &quot;BioCode&quot;, which attempted to unify the rank-based approach into a single code, as a model. Thus, the organization of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;, some of its terminology, and the wording of certain rules are derived from the &quot;BioCode&quot;. Other rules are derived from one or more of the rank-based codes, particularly the botanical and zoological codes. However, many rules in the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; have no counterpart in any code based on taxonomic ranks because of fundamental differences in the definitional foundations of the alternative systems. Note that the PhyloCode does not govern the names of species, whose rules of availability, typification, etc., remain regulated by the requisite traditional Code of Nomenclature.

==Future==

The &quot;PhyloCode&quot; is controversial and has inspired considerable criticism from some taxonomists. While inaugurated decades ago, the number of supporters for widespread adoption of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; is still small, and the publication of PhyloCode literature stagnated in the mid-2010s, before accelerating after publication of Phylonyms in 2020 and of the launch of the Bulletin of Phylogenetic Nomenclature, which is a journal dedicated to the publication of nomenclatural acts (especially definition of taxon names) valid under the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;. To be valid under the PhyloCode, taxon names and associated definitions should be registered in the RegNum database.

A list of published critiques of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; can be found on the ISPN&#x27;s website, as can a list of rebuttals.

<doc id="436333" wikidata="Q424160" url="?curid=436333" title="Akutagawa Prize">
<text>The is a Japanese literary award presented biannually. Because of its prestige and the considerable attention the winner receives from the media, it is, along with the Naoki Prize, one of Japan&#x27;s most sought after literary prizes.

==History==

The Akutagawa Prize was established in 1935 by Kan Kikuchi, then-editor of &quot;Bungeishunjū&quot; magazine, in memory of author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. It is sponsored by the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Literature, and is awarded in January and July to the best serious literary story published in a newspaper or magazine by a new or rising author. The winner receives a pocket watch and a cash award of 1 million yen. The judges usually include contemporary writers, literary critics, and former winners of the prize. Occasionally, when consensus cannot be reached between judges over disputes about the winning story or the quality of work for that half year, no prize is awarded. From 1945 through 1948 no prizes were awarded due to postwar instability. The prize has frequently been split between two authors.

On January 15, 2004, the awarding of the 130th Akutagawa Prize made significant news when two women became the award&#x27;s youngest winners. The prize went to both Risa Wataya, 19, for her novel and to Hitomi Kanehara, 20, for her debut novel . In 2013 Natsuko Kuroda won the 148th Akutagawa Prize at age 75, making her the oldest recipient in the history of the prize.

===Controversies===
In 1972, Akutagawa winner was found to have committed plagiarism. In 2018, a similar controversy occurred when the candidate novel by Yuko Hojo was found to have reused text from its nonfiction source material without attribution, but the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Literature did not remove the book from the candidate list.

===Records===

* The youngest recipient of the prize to date is Risa Wataya who was 19 when she received the award for &quot;I Want to Kick You in the Back&quot; (). 
* The best-seller title (in Japan only) is &quot;Spark&quot; (), by Naoki Matayoshi which sold 2,29 millions of copies.

==Winners==
Bungeishunjū maintains an official archive of current and past winners on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Literature.

<text>Lee Harwood (6 June 1939 – 26 July 2015) was an English poet associated with the British Poetry Revival.

==Life==
Travers Rafe Lee Harwood was born in Leicester to maths teacher Wilfred Travers Lee-Harwood and Grace Ladkin Harwood, who were then living in Chertsey, Surrey. His father was an army reservist and called up as war started; after the evacuation from Dunkirk he was posted to Africa until 1947 and saw little of his son. Between 1958 and 1961 Harwood studied English at Queen Mary College, University of London and continued living in London until 1967. During that time he worked as a monumental mason&#x27;s mate, a librarian and a bookshop assistant. He was also a member of the Beat scene and in 1963 was involved in editing the one issue magazines &quot;Night Scene&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot; featuring their work, as did &quot;Soho&quot; and &quot;Horde&quot; the following year. &quot;Tzarad&quot;, which he began editing on his own in 1965, ran for two more issues (1966, 1969) and signalled his growing interest in and involvement with the New York School of poets. It was during this time that he began to engage with French poetry and started on his translations of Tristan Tzara.

In 1967 he moved to Brighton where, with the exception of some time in Greece and the United States, he lived for the rest of his life. There he worked as a bookshop manager, a bus conductor, and a Post Office counter clerk. He also became a union official and involved with the Labour Party in its radical years, even standing (unsuccessfully) in a local election. At the Poetry Society Harwood was identified with the radicals but did not join in their block resignation in 1977, arguing that &#x27;as a trade unionist I&#x27;ve never believed in resignation as a useful political weapon – it always seems best to work from inside an organisation&#x27;. At that time, there was an identifiable political element to Harwood&#x27;s poetry, discernible in the volume &quot;All The Wrong Notes&quot; (1981).

In 1961 he married his first wife, Jenny Goodgame, with whom he had a son, Blake. After the breakdown of this marriage, he met the photographer Judith Walker while a writer in residence at the Aegean School of Fine Arts in Paros, Greece. Harwood married her in 1974 and they had two children, Rafe and Rowan. Photographs by Walker are used in his collections &quot;Boston-Brighton&quot; and &quot;All the wrong notes&quot;. Lee Harwood died on Sunday, 26 July 2015 in Hove, East Sussex. and was interred in Clayton Burial Ground near Hassocks, East Sussex. There is a tree (Mountain Ash), and memorial stone in the Literary Walk, in Central Park, New York City. There is also a memorial bench on the north path of Brunswick Square, Hove, UK.

==Poetry==

Harwood&#x27;s early writing is similar to the poetry of the New York School, especially that of John Ashbery, whom he met in Paris in 1965. What he was aiming for, he said in a 1972 interview, was an unfinished quality containing a mosaic of information. Robert Sheppard has described Harwood&#x27;s style as at once &#x27;distanced and intimate&#x27;. Later, after discussion with F. T. Prince, he aimed for a certain elegance where references to the English colonial enterprise function as an alternative cultural mythology. There is about this writing an aspect of collage (which Harwood likens to similar procedures in cinema and painting) which he takes even further in the collections published during the 1970s. Here lyric lines alternate with scraps of conversation, blocks of prose or long-lined verse. In his later work, however, some critics have discerned a falling off of immediacy while, in the view of others, such as Alan Baker, Harwood &#x27;returned to form&#x27; with the books &#x27;Morning Light&#x27; (1998) and &#x27;Evening Star&#x27; (2004).

Harwood&#x27;s first book, &quot;title illegible&quot;, was published by Bob Cobbing&#x27;s Writers Forum in 1965. His &quot;Crossing the Frozen River: Selected Poems&quot; appeared from Paladin Books in 1988; Shearsman Books has since published both an updated &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (2008) and a definitive &quot;New Collected Poems&quot; (2023). Audio recordings of Harwood reading his poetry may be found on the University of Pennsylvania PennSound website Lee Harwood

<doc id="436340" wikidata="Q1556717" url="?curid=436340" title="USS Fargo (CL-106)">
<text>USS &quot;Fargo&quot; (CL-106), named after the city of Fargo, North Dakota, was the lead ship of her class of light cruisers of the United States Navy, most of which were canceled due to the end of World War II.

The &quot;Fargo&quot;-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with a single trunked funnel, intended to improve AA gun arcs of fire.

The cruiser was launched 25 February 1945 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. F. O. Olsen, and commissioned 9 December 1945.

==Service history==

&quot;Fargo&quot; sailed from Philadelphia on 15 April 1946, with Vice Admiral Bernard H. Bieri embarked for a goodwill cruise to Bermuda, Trinidad, Recife, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo, from which she took departure on 31 May for the Mediterranean. During this tour of duty, she visited a variety of ports in Turkey, Lebanon, Greece, Italy, and France, as well as North Africa and served as American representative at Trieste, then troubled by dissension between Italy and Yugoslavia over the city&#x27;s status.

Returning to New York City on 2 March 1947, &quot;Fargo&quot; sailed once more for the Mediterranean on 20 May, and during this tour of duty, served for one month as flagship for Commander, Naval Forces Mediterranean. Returning to Newport on 13 September, she prepared for extensive Atlantic Fleet exercises in October and November in the waters from Bermuda to Newfoundland, during which she carried Vice Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander 2nd Task Fleet.

Through her remaining two years of service, &quot;Fargo&quot; completed two more tours of duty in the Mediterranean, and twice joined in large scale exercises in the Caribbean. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve, berthed at Bayonne, New Jersey, 14 February 1950, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1970, and sold on 18 August 1971 to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, Kearney, New Jersey.

A large model of the USS &quot;Fargo&quot; was on display at the main branch of the Fargo Public Library for many years. The model was moved to the Cass County Historical Society at Bonanzaville before being moved to the Fargo air and space museum.

<text>Abelardo Rodríguez Luján, commonly known as Abelardo L. Rodríguez (; 12 May 1889 – 13 February 1967) was a Mexican military officer, businessman and politician who served as Substitute President of Mexico from 1932 to 1934. He completed the term of President Pascual Ortiz Rubio after his resignation, during the period known as the Maximato, when Former President Plutarco Elías Calles (&quot;El Jefe Máximo&quot;) held considerable de facto political power, without being president himself. Rodríguez was, however, more successful than Ortiz Rubio had been in asserting presidential power against Calles&#x27;s influence.

Rodríguez left the political arena for a while after his term ended, devoting himself to travel and business interests. Rodríguez returned to politics a decade later, serving as Governor of the state of Sonora, retiring in 1948 and returning to his business interests. To date, Rodríguez is the only Mexican to have been brigadier general, president, and governor of two different states.

== Early life ==
Rodríguez was born on 12 May 1889 to a poor family in San José de Guaymas, Sonora.

When he was eleven years old, he briefly attended school in Nogales, Arizona. There, he was attacked by two older American boys named Owen Walker and Don Herrera, due to anti-Mexican sentiment. He was in line one day, when Herrera got in front of him and Walker behind. Herrera gave Rodríguez a sharp shove, throwing Rodríguez on top of Walker, who had a knife in his hand. Walker slashed Rodríguez through his left cheek, making an incision, at least six centimeters (2.3 inches), from the mouth upwards.

Later, as a young man, Rodríguez returned to Arizona to take his revenge. However, he found that Walker had died in a farming accident and that Herrera had moved to California with his family. After reflecting on Walker&#x27;s tragic death, Rodríguez reconsidered and dropped his bid for revenge.

Rodríguez never finished his primary studies. Instead, he dropped out after the 4th grade to begin working in order to help support his family. However, he vowed to educate himself. As a young man he worked at his brother&#x27;s hardware store, at a copper mine in Cananea, and as a professional baseball player in Nogales, Sonora. He worked briefly worked at an iron manufacturer in Los Angeles, California while attempting to pursue a career as a singer. After failing as a singer in Los Angeles, he returned to Mexico.

In Sonora, he briefly worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad before being discharged. Due to his red-green color blindness, he had failed his test to become a railroad conductor. In 1912, he became a police commander in Nogales, Sonora.

== Military career ==
Rodríguez joined the Mexican Revolution as a Lieutenant on 1 March 1913. He joined the irregular Second Battalion of Sonora, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Orozco. Rodríguez chronicled his military experience in his 1962 autobiography.

=== Northern skirmishes ===
He experienced his first combat on 24 August 1913, at Cruz de la Piedra, Sonora. There, the Second Battalion forces ambushed a train carrying Federal Army troops from Mexico City, led by General Girón. The &quot;Norteños&quot; massacred the &quot;Federales&quot; and killed General Girón.

In late 1913 Rodríguez fought at Los Mochis and then at Sinaloa de Leyva. On 1 October 1913, in Sinaloa de Leyva, he received his promotion to Second Captain. On 14 October 1913, he helped take Culiacán. On 1 March 1914, he was appointed Second Paymaster. The Second Battalion was incorporated into the irregular Fourth Battalion of Sonora, which was part of the escort of General Venustiano Carranza.

=== Shooting incident and prison ===
In June 1914, the Fourth Battalion was at Durango City in the State of Durango. There, Rodríguez was insulted by Captain Pedro Almada, who was his superior. The incident was unprovoked, and occurred at a dinner, at a long table in front of many officers. Rodríguez responded by standing, drawing his pistol, and firing one shot at Captain Almada&#x27;s forehead. He missed, and the bullet hit a wall behind the Captain.

On 16 June 1914, Rodríguez was arrested for insubordination and sent to the Durango State Penitentiary. On 24 June 1914, Rodríguez was released from prison. A law intern, Jesús Dorador Ibarra, had been able to verify that due to his salary as paymaster, Rodríguez had actually assimilated the rank of first captain and, therefore, there was no insubordination. A judge revoked the arrest warrant and Rodríguez was free. On the day of his release, he was visited by Captain Pedro Almada. They forgave each other and became friends.

=== Entering Mexico City ===
Rodríguez re-joined the Fourth Battalion of Sonora and continued serving under General Carranza. On 17 July 1914, Rodríguez received his official promotion to first captain. On 20 August 1914, Carranza and the Fourth Battalion entered Mexico City and General Carranza assumed the provisional presidency of the Republic. In late 1914, the irregular Fourth Battalion of Sonora was incorporated into the Northwest Army Corps of the Constitutional Army, led by General Alvaro Obregón. On 21 December 1914, Rodríguez was promoted to major, while on the railroad above Mexico City.

=== Battle of Celaya and Further Campaigns Against Villa ===
On 10 May 1915, the Constitutional Army commanded by General Obregón left Mexico City to engage the army of General Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa. After some light combat, the Constitutional Army arrived at Celaya, where it fought the Battle of Celaya against Villa&#x27;s División del Norte from 6 to 15 April 1915. During this battle, Rodríguez was shot through his right ear while manning a machine gun.

The Constitutional Army won the battle. On 25 April 1915, Rodríguez was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In June 1915, during fighting against Villa&#x27;s forces near León, Guanajuato, Rodríguez was shot in the thigh. He was sent to Guadalajara for surgery to remove splintered bone fragments. After healing, he rejoined the Constitutional Army and fought remnants of Villa&#x27;s forces at Aguascalientes and Saltillo.

On 1 March 1916, Rodríguez was promoted to colonel. On 2 June 1916, Rodríguez took charge of the Second Infantry Brigade of the First Northwest Division of the Constitutional Army. The brigade consisted of six mostly Yaqui battalions.

=== Yaqui Campaign ===
In 1917, Rodríguez joined General Plutarco Elías Calles at his headquarters in Empalme, Sonora. They were tasked with subduing the indigenous Yaqui in Sonora, who rejected the authority of the federal government in Mexico City. The campaign used three flying columns: one under the command of General Arnulfo R. Gómez, one under the command of Colonel Jesús Aguirre, and the third under the command of Rodríguez (the Second Infantry Brigade). The campaign lasted three years, from 1917 to around 1920. During this time, Rodríguez was promoted to general.

=== Baja California Expedition ===
Rodríguez was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, on 21 May 1920, while in Mexico City. He then held the position of chief of the Presidential Guards from 21 June to 20 July 1920.

On 21 July 1920, Rodríguez was appointed head of a 6,000-man expeditionary column, supported by a gunboat, charged with expelling Colonel Esteban Cantú from Baja California. Cantú had ignored the federal government, disobeyed orders, and acted independently; President Adolfo de la Huerta and Calles responded by dispatching Rodríguez to oust Cantú. Cantú went into exile in Los Angeles, however, before Rodríguez arrived from Mexico City with his forces. Later, in 1926 Rodríguez would allow Cantú to re-enter Baja California. Cantú returned to Mexicali, where he ventured into private business and continued to serve as a public official. He died in Mexicali in 1966.

==== Military commander of the North Territory of Baja California ====
Rodríguez became military commander of the North Territory of Baja California in 1921, after discharging Cantú&#x27;s troops. During that period he closed most casinos and bars in the border town of Tijuana, which had flourished under Cantú as a destination for North American vice tourism. However, these would soon be allowed to re-open.

== Governor of the North Territory of Baja California (1923-1929) ==
In 1923, Rodríguez became Governor of the North Territory of Baja California. He continued his role as Military Commander, while acting as Governor of that state. Rodríguez served as Governor of the North Territory of Baja California until 31 December 1929.

=== Vice ===
Like his predecessor Colonel Esteban Cantú, Rodríguez personally benefited from Tijuana&#x27;s vice industry, which had grown in the years after Cantú&#x27;s departure, largely due to its close proximity to San Diego and Los Angeles during Prohibition. In addition to legitimate investments in the private sector, Rodríguez grew wealthy through the sale of licenses associated with vice tourism. Besides granting concessions to liquor and gambling establishments, Rodríguez also became a major partner of US entrepreneurs who were involved in these activities.

During his tenure as governor, Rodríguez also made money from the sale of alcohol and the traffic of opium. According to Francisco Cruz, Rodríguez learned the drug trafficking business from Cantú.

=== Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel ===
Rodríguez was involved in the development of the Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel. This vast resort attracted wealthy Americans, Hollywood stars, and an elite global clientele.

The Agua Caliente was built at a cost of $10 million by the Agua Caliente Company, which was formed by North American investors Baron H. Long, Wirt G. Bowman and James N. Crofton. The fourth equal partner was Governor Rodríguez, who owned 25%.

Since the Americans could not own Mexican land, Rodríguez purchased the land upon which the resort was built, at the site of a hot springs. The contract for the construction was awarded to Rodríguez&#x27;s brother Fernando L. Rodríguez. According to &quot;Satan&#x27;s Playground&quot; author Paul J. Vanderwood, Rodríguez used taxpayer money to construct and outfit the enterprise.

The resort brought in enormous sums of money. After visiting the casino, one &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter concluded that &quot;there isn&#x27;t another place on the continent, outside of a US Mint, where you can see so much money piled up before your eyes at one time. Its only rival in the world is Monte Carlo.&quot; The resort operated from 1928 to 1935.

=== Business interests ===
During his time as governor, Rodríguez also had success making legitimate investments in the private sector. He established the Pesquera del Pacifico fish and shellfish cannery in El Sauzal, outside Ensenada. He invested in an airplane manufacturing company in Baja California. He also formed an oil company to search for petroleum in Baja California, although this endeavor ultimately proved fruitless.

=== Autonomy and wealth ===
Due to the remote nature of Baja California, and his close connection to the rulers in Mexico City, Rodríguez enjoyed considerable autonomy during his tenure in Baja California. He had served as an officer under Obregón during the Mexican Revolution, and they had both been wounded at the Battle of Celaya, Later, Rodríguez lent Obregón a significant amount of money to help him defeat Adolfo de la Huerta. In return President Obregón allowed Rodríguez to continue his operations in the vice industry.

Governor Rodríguez continued to enjoy the same autonomy during the Maximato, because of his close alliance and personal friendship with Calles. By the late 1920s Rodríguez was the richest man in Baja California, due to his control over the border vice industry. By the time Rodríguez became president in 1932, he had over US$12 million deposited in banks in Los Angeles, New York City, and London.

=== San Diego house ===
In 1926, while still Governor of Baja California, Rodríguez and his wife Aída Sullivan Coya purchased a newly built Spanish Colonial home at 4379 North Talmadge Drive in the Talmadge Park Neighborhood, in San Diego, California. The house was designed by architect Louis John Gill. Rodríguez probably used the home as a part-time retreat during his presidential term (1932-1934). However, this is not known for certain. The couple sold the home in 1940, and the house still exists today.

=== Public works ===
Taxes from the regional vice businesses helped the Baja California government fund public works and supported industries such as aviation and agriculture. The taxes earned as a result of vice also supported education and the arts. During the Rodríguez administration, Baja California was one of just two entities in Mexico with an elementary educational system that satisfied 100% of the needs of the population, for free. The Alvaro Obregón Elementary School in Tijuana was built at the end of the Rodríguez administration, and it was among the best in the country. Inaugurated in 1930, the school is now the IMAC - Casa de la Cultura Tijuana.

=== Escobar Rebellion ===
In 1929, Rodríguez was invited to join the proposed Escobar Rebellion of General José Gonzalo Escobar. This turned out to be a mistake for Escobar. Rodríguez declined, and also gave Calles advance warning of the rebellion, demonstrating his loyalty to Calles and allowing Calles and President Emilio Portes Gil to jointly defeat Escobar.

== Post-governorship ==
On 31 December 1929, Rodríguez resigned as Governor of the North Territory of Baja California.

=== European travels ===
In early 1930, Rodríguez and his family traveled to Europe. There, Rodríguez studied accommodation systems for troop units and military camps. They remained in Europe for about 10 months, before moving to Rodríguez&#x27;s ranch at El Sauzal, outside Ensenada.

== Federal Cabinet positions (1931-1932) ==
In 1931, Rodríguez was called to Mexico City to serve in the cabinet of new President Ortiz Rubio. From October 1931 to January 1932, Rodríguez was Undersecretary of War and Navy. From January 1932 to July 1932 he was Secretary of Industry, Commerce and Labor. From August 1932 to September 1932 he was Secretary of War and Navy.

==Substitute president (1932-1934)==
===Election===
President Ortiz Rubio resigned because of conflicts with Calles. Thus, the question of succession was vital. Ortiz Rubio signed his resignation on 2 September 1932, and it was conveyed to Congress the next day. Despite the resignation, the presidential cabinet met, significantly, at the home of former President Calles in Cuernavaca. The President of the National Revolutionary Party, General Manuel Pérez Treviño, announced the names of those whom Calles had made known would be acceptable: Finance Minister Alberto J. Pani, General Joaquín Amaro, and General Abelardo L. Rodriguez. Pani bowed out and suggested that Calles choose Rodríguez. However, four candidates were presented to Congress, with the name of General Juan José Ríos, Secretary of the Interior, added to the other three.

A groundswell of support gave the presidency to Rodríguez, who was named by Congress as President of Mexico on 4 September 1932. The Rodríguez presidency represented the last two years of the Maximato.

===Cabinet===
Rodríguez&#x27;s cabinet included Emilio Portes Gil, who had served as interim president from 1928 to 1930. Unlike the cabinet of his predecessor Ortiz Rubio, with excessive changes of personnel, Rodríguez&#x27;s cabinet was more stable.

===Asserting power===

During Rodríguez&#x27;s presidency, Calles was at first widely considered as de facto leader of the Republic. The Mexican press still called Calles &quot;El Jefe Máximo de la Revolución&quot; (The Supreme Chief of the Revolution). The American press called him the &quot;Strong Man of Mexico&quot;. Thus, many North American observers saw Rodríguez as a weak political puppet of Calles. And this view is often shared by contemporary historians. For instance, in &quot;The Course of Mexican History&quot;, Sherman and Meyer deride Rodríguez as &quot;a man with less administrative talent than relish for power, as puppet number three of the Maximato&quot;.

However, unlike Portes Gil and Ortiz Rubio, Rodríguez was a friend and ally of Calles. Thus, Professor Jürgen Buchenau asserts that overall, due to Calles&#x27;s declining health, and Rodríguez&#x27;s own private wealth and astute political maneuvering, Rodríguez was actually able to reclaim a significant degree of political power for the Executive office during his tenure. According to a US Military Attache report from 1932, Calles felt he was leaving the Government in safe, capable hands with Rodríguez.

Outside observers corroborate these views. For instance, the Mexico City newspaper and magazine publisher Felix S. Palavicini referred to President Rodríguez as the &quot;Mexican Roosevelt&quot; because the Rodríguez administration closely paralleled that of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Palavicini stated in January 1934 that President Rodríguez was making extraordinary efforts to educate the Mexican people, and that the minimum wage law was greatly reducing poverty. And according to Col. Ed Fletcher, the San Diego real estate developer and politician, President Rodríguez was one of the strongest presidents in Mexico&#x27;s history. Fletcher stated that &quot;President Rodríguez is developing Mexico in a commercial and cultural way.&quot;

Calles still had considerable sway, however, over some of Rodríguez&#x27;s ministers, who often consulted with Calles before affecting policy. And rogue Finance Minister Alberto J. Pani attempted to temper Rodríguez&#x27;s adoption of deficit spending and objected to the government&#x27;s anticlerical tendencies. As a result, Rodríguez forced Pani&#x27;s resignation from the cabinet. To appease Calles, who objected to the ousting of Pani, Rodríguez appointed Calles as Finance Minister.

Calles&#x27; health, which had never been particularly good, declined significantly during the Rodríguez presidency. In 1932 doctors discovered that Calles was suffering from a combination of arthritis, arteriosclerosis, and chronic intestinal disease caused by poor diet. Thus, his bad health and advancing age increasingly detracted from his attention to political issues. As a result of his health, he did not spend much time in Mexico City. During the Rodríguez presidency, Calles actually vacationed for months at a time at President Rodríguez&#x27;s ranch in El Sauzal, Baja California, and at Calles&#x27; daughter-in-law&#x27;s beach cottage in El Tambor, Sinaloa. To compound Calles&#x27;s health woes, his young second wife, Leonor Llorente de Calles, was diagnosed with a brain tumor in spring 1932. She died in Mexico City a few months later, after a failed surgery. &quot;Calles&#x27;s health and state of mind constituted the Achilles heel of this powerful leader.&quot; Eventually, Calles bought a ranch in Cuernavaca, about 50 miles south of Mexico City, where he spent most of his time.

Rodríguez dealt competently with the public perception that, although he was president, Calles was still in charge. For instance, in March 1934, US President Franklin Roosevelt wrote Calles a letter &quot;congratulating him on the peace and the growing prosperity of Mexico&quot;. The letter was to be delivered at a luncheon that Calles was hosting for Josephus Daniels, the new US ambassador to Mexico. Rodríguez was told of the luncheon at Calles&#x27;s Cuernavaca ranch, to which many Mexican and foreign dignitaries had already been invited. The information was provided to Rodríguez by José Manuel Puig Casauranc.

When he heard of this slight, Rodríguez was adamant that the lunch be cancelled, since Calles was &quot;simply a private citizen&quot;. It was not the prerogative of an ex-president to host such an event. Guests were disinvited on the pretext that Calles had taken ill. &quot;The President maintained that if any such luncheon were to be given it should be given by him, and that if a message should come from President Roosevelt it should come to the President of Mexico.&quot; The Roosevelt letter to Calles was eventually delivered. Calles replied that although he held Roosevelt in very high regard, he was not part of the current President&#x27;s administration.

After the letter incident, US Ambassador Daniels made another misstep by calling Calles the &quot;Strong Man of Mexico&quot; in an interview with the Mexican newspaper &quot;El Nacional&quot;. Rodríguez called Daniels out for this gaffe, with the ambassador subsequently claiming that he had been misquoted. Daniels later wrote in his memoirs that Daniels, Calles, and Puig Casauranc &quot;knew that the man (Rodríguez) in Chapultepec Castle (the official presidential residence) was the President of Mexico&quot;.

=== Relations with the United States ===
Rodríguez was fluent in English, owned a home in San Diego, and had spent some time working in Los Angeles before the Mexican Revolution. He later became wealthy due to his dealings with North American business partners in Tijuana. In addition, his second wife was from Chicago. Thus, he was quite pro-American.

One of Rodríguez&#x27;s first acts was to define the Mexican government&#x27;s attitude toward the US. He said, &quot;My policy toward the United States will consist of continuing the relations of friendship which have existed.&quot; In January 1933, the US Military Attache in Mexico, Robert E. Cummings, observed that &quot;General Rodríguez is doing a good job as President and is assuming more and more the responsibilities and decisions, which were formerly left to General Calles during the Ortiz Rubio administration.&quot; And US Ambassador Reuben Clark reported that the peso had strengthened with Rodriguez, indicating the confidence in him in financial circles and that the policy of the United States was one of cordial friendship.

=== Education ===
Rodríguez&#x27;s government organized the Council of Primary Education in the Federal District and created cultural missions in rural areas. He also established agricultural schools and regional farm schools, as well as schools for teacher education. He also established the Technical Council of Rural Education.

Narciso Bassols was Minister of Education and pursued a policy that took control of education out of the hands of Mexican states and put it under federal control. At issue was the continued influence of the Catholic Church on students. Under Bassols, the proposition that the education should explicitly advocate socialism was to be official policy, and he moved to embed that in the Mexican Constitution. Bassols also increased teachers&#x27; salaries and sought to undermine the influence of teachers&#x27; groups.

Many parents objected to sex education in the schools, and there was considerable resistance from the Church. Rodríguez shifted Bassols from Education to the high-level post as Minister of the Interior, and Baddols then resigned. Rodríguez feared the potential of strong moves against the Catholic Church of causing problems for his successor as president.

=== Relations with the Catholic Church ===
Under Interim President Emilio Portes Gil, the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico and the Mexican government had come to an agreement that would end the Cristero War in 1929. The Catholic Church was displeased that there were continued anti-Catholic moves in parts of the country, especially Jalisco and Chiapas. Pope Pius XI issued an encyclical that objected to Mexican legislation detrimental to Catholic clergy.

Rodríguez strongly objected to the encyclical as full of falsehoods and &quot;would incite the clergy to disobey the Mexican rulings&quot;. The Vatican&#x27;s representative in Mexico, Apostolic Delegate Archbishop Leopoldo Ruiz y Flóres, tried to say that the Mexican government had misunderstood the Pope&#x27;s message. Congress demanded his expulsion, and he was put on a plane.

Ruiz y Flores then called on Mexican Catholics not to be members of the PNR since it was socialistic and atheistic, and he called for action by the Catholic faithful. &quot;Each Catholic should be converted into a school of Christian doctrine–into a real apostle—and we shall see that the persecution is converted into blessings from Heaven.&quot; The strongly anticlerical Calles, whose policies while president had provoked the Cristero War, called for the expulsion of the papal representative as well as the archbishop of Mexico. The papal representative was already outside the country and would be arrested if he returned. Rodríguez authorized Portes Gil, then Minister of the Interior, to draw up a recommendation, which he could discuss with Calles. Steps were taken against the high clerics, but there was no uprising of Catholics against the government, despite clerical calls for one.

=== Agriculture, labor, and industry ===
The government issued the Agrarian Code, which brought together scattered legislation on agrarian matters. Rodríguez renewed efforts to distribute landed estates into the hands of peasants, which had slowed under the Calles administration. Rodríguez promoted the activities of the National Agricultural Credit Bank.

President Rodríguez was responsible for many programs devised to help Mexican workers survive the Great Depression. In August 1933 he urged Mexican manufacturers and farmers to align with his plan to establish a minimum wage. Through the minimum wage law for Mexican workers, he aimed to intensify Mexico&#x27;s industrial development and make the nation less dependent on international trade. The law took effect on 1 January 1934, and it was set at between one peso and three pesos daily, depending on the type of work and the region of Mexico. In August 1934, President Rodríguez stated that his minimum wage law had benefited 2.5 million agricultural and industrial workers, and increased the public&#x27;s purchasing power by 1.5 million pesos daily since it took effect, for a projected total increase of 547,000,000 pesos by the end of 1934.

He created the Department of Labor and promoted the trade union movement and protected workers against management. He established regulations of the Federal Board of Conciliation and Arbitration and created the Federal Office of Labor Defense, of Agencies of Placements, of Dangerous and Unhealthy Work, of Labor Hygiene, of the Federal Labor Inspection and of Preventive Measures of Accidents. He was a supporter of co-operativies, which he thought would distribute the national wealth more equitably, and he pressed Congress to issue the Cooperatives Act. Important for future actions on Mexico&#x27;s petroleum industry was Rodríguez&#x27;s creation of a private company, Petromex, tied to the government, that guarded supply for domestic use and could compete with foreign investors in the industry.

=== Infrastructure ===

Calles had initiated an ambitious program of road building, which continued in the 1930s under Rodríguez. Roads were would link important centers within Mexico as well as with the United States in the north and Guatemala in the south. They would also connect between remote areas of Mexico and the larger nation. Road building was a form of state building. Construction on the Pan-American Highway saw progress, with a map issued in 1933 showing the route.

=== Law ===
During his presidency, he improved the organization and operation of common justice, issuing the Organic Law of the District and Territorial Courts. The federal codes were reviewed and the Federal Law on Criminal Procedures was issued. He organized the Office of the Attorney General, determining the functions of the Federal Public Ministry, which carried out the study of the Law of Protection and issued the Personal Identification, Nationality and Naturalization, Foreign Service and General Mercantile Companies. He also implemented laws related to private charity and monopolies. He issued the Limited Liability and Public Interest Corporation Law. He enacted the Code of Military Justice.

=== Economy and finance ===
He established the National Economic Council and created the National Financial bank. He founded the Bank of the Pacific, the Mexican Bank of the West, and the Central Mexican Credit. He reformed the Law of Secretaries of State, transforming the Department of Commerce, Commerce and Labor into the Secretariat of the National Economy, which was responsible for establishing the bases of state interventionism and the managed economy.

== Post-presidency ==
On 30 November 1934, Rodríguez peacefully passed power to Cárdenas, then returned to private life. As a reformer, Cárdenas outlawed gambling and closed all the casinos in the north, including the famed Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel. This deprived Rodríguez (and Calles) of a significant source of income. However, by this time, Rodríguez was already one of the richest men in Mexico.

=== Travel and life abroad ===
Rodríguez and his wife, Aída Sullivan, traveled the world for several years after the presidency, partly to avoid political intrigue. They visited the United States, Canada, Europe, North Africa, Turkey, India, China, Japan, the Philippines, Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia, Cuba, Panama, and Guatemala. The couple lived in London, England, from 1936 to 1937. Afterwards, Rodríguez traveled extensively through Russia with his personal secretary Alfonso Verdugo. While in Russia, Rodríguez studied the Soviet political system in great depth. Later, he wrote about what he saw there in his autobiography. After touring Russia, Rodríguez returned to Mexico in 1938.

=== Business interests ===
In 1938, Rodríguez and Sullivan moved to their sprawling ranch on the Pacific Coast, at El Sauzal in Baja California. During this time, Rodríguez invested his wealth in various productive industries. He primarily focused on shrimping, fishing and sea products packing. In 1939, Rodríguez built the Pesquera de Topolobampo in Topolobampo, Sinaloa. At the time, it was the largest shrimp-freezing plant in the world.

In September 1940, he warned President Cárdenas of the dangers of renewing Japanese shrimping concessions in Mexican waters. He convinced Cárdenas that a 100% Mexican shrimping industry was safer, and so the Japanese lost the concession. Rodríguez was key in helping to build this industry domestically, and he became involved in various seafood companies like Compañía Productos Marinos de Guaymas, S.A.

In 1942, he became the owner and operator of the 50,000-watt XERB radio station in Rosarito.

=== World War II ===
Mexico declared war on the Axis powers on 22 May 1942. Although the country&#x27;s combat role was limited, Mexico did aid the Allies with air squadrons such as the Aztec Eagles. Mexico also helped defend the Gulf of Mexico. During the war, Rodríguez was appointed commander of the Gulf of Mexico Military-Naval Zone. This was the most important military zone in the country, due to constant incursion by Nazi submarines. As commander, he took steps to protect the Gulf from German U-boats. In July 1942, he ordered the arrest of two Nazi spies in the State of Veracruz. Both were suspected of signaling Nazi submarines. One of the Germans was found in a house on the beach with radio sets, code books, and firearms. The other, Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, was a former leader of the German American Bund. Both spies were sent to the US to face trial for espionage.

Mexico&#x27;s major contribution to the war effort was a steady supply of raw materials for US industry. Thus, during the war, Rodríguez also served as chief supervisor of the Mexican government&#x27;s intensified farm-factory production program. In 1943, the US government provided drug plant seeds to the Mexican Department of Agriculture. This joint agriculture program supplied the war effort with plants used for legal drug production. Rodríguez personally donated land and labor to this drug plant-producing program.

== Governor of Sonora ==
In 1943, he was elected governor of Sonora. While in office, he taxed Chinese casinos and &quot;recreation centers&quot;, a euphemism for opium dens. The income allowed the government to avoid taxing &quot;productive enterprises&quot;. Rodríguez himself had become a wealthy man, largely from vice income.

=== Infrastructure ===
In his position as governor of Sonora, his entrepreneurial energy and futuristic vision stand out, and he was the initiator of the modernization of Sonora, being an important manager in the construction of state infrastructure on which agricultural development was based. Under his administration, the Municipal Palace of Hermosillo and the Bank of Mexico building were built. Rodríguez also approved numerous drainage systems, dams, and municipal markets. In 1947, the Hermosillo-Nogales highway and the Benjamín Hill-Puerto Peñasco section of the Sonora-Baja California Railroad were completed. Rodríguez approved the project for the construction of a thermoelectric plant in the Port of Guaymas.

=== Education and philanthropy ===
During his tenure, he increased teachers&#x27; salaries and decreed the construction of 186 new school buildings, 11 expanded schools, and 145 rebuilt schools. Rodríguez also actively promoted university education in Sonora. The Museum and Library of the University of Sonora were built during his administration. It is estimated that half of the construction cost for the museum and library came out of his personal pocket.

He was convinced that education was the main weapon to combat inequality. In 1946 he and his wife Aída Sullivan brought together a committee of distinguished businessmen and prominent members of Sonoran society. Their goal was to solicit donations and allocate funds, in order to grant scholarships to low-income students from the State of Sonora. The committee proposed that the aggregate donations be invested, and that the investment returns would provide the funds to support the students. Rodríguez and Sullivan made a personal donation of 1 million pesos (US$47,989), thus endowing the initial assets and establishing the &quot;Fundación Esposos Rodríguez&quot; (The Rodriguez Couple Foundation). Over the years, the foundation has seen exponential growth in the number of scholarship holders who receive support. The foundation currently supports more than 5,500 students at different levels of education.

== Post-governorship ==
Rodríguez resigned from his governorship in April 1948, citing health issued caused by diabetes.

=== Business interests ===
Rodríguez returned to his work in business. On 1 January 1950, he was appointed general manager of a large meat-packing firm in Sonora called Frigorífico y Empacadora S.A. In 1950, he became co-owner of a shrimp-freezing plant in El Golfo de Santa Clara, Sonora. In 1953, he built the Hotel Garci Crespo, a huge spa resort in Tehuacan, Puebla.

=== Film industry ===
Rodríguez became involved in the Mexican film industry during the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. In 1950, he was appointed director general &amp; chairman of the board of the Crédito Cinematográfico Mexicano, S.A. This government-sponsored film trade financial house was responsible for advancing the Mexican film industry, domestically and abroad.

Rodríguez became a leading movie exhibitor and producer. He owned a Mexican film distribution company called Distribuidora Mexicana de Películas, S.A. He also owned over 100 movie theaters in Mexico. In 1953, he helped modernize these theaters by installing CinemaScope technology. By 1954, Rodríguez had become known internationally as a film tycoon. He had acquired eleven top cinema houses in Mexico City, including Cine Opera, Cine Florida, Cine Colonial, Cine Chapultepec, and Cine Mariscala. He also owned the controlling interest in Mexico City&#x27;s largest theater, the 6,500-seat Cine Coloso. Moreover, Rodríguez owned several provincial theaters.

Along with his North American business partner Theodore Gildred Sr., Rodríguez was the owner of Tepeyac Studios in Mexico City. Nearly 150 films were shot there, including Luis Buñuel&#x27;s classic &quot;Los Olvidados&quot; (1950). Tepeyac Studios also produced the award-winning film &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1954), and parts of the film were shot there. Directed by Luis Buñuel, two versions of the film were created, one in English and one in Spanish. The film was a critical and commercial success and was distributed in Mexico by Rodriguez&#x27;s film distribution company. In 1954, Rodríguez made a deal with 20th Century Fox to produce CinemaScope movies in Mexico. Tepeyac Studios closed down permanently in 1957.

===Further political matters===
In 1951, President Miguel Alemán Valdés, nearing the end of his six-year term, expressed his desire to have the Constitution amended to allow him to be re-elected. Former presidents Lázaro Cárdenas and Manuel Ávila Camacho, who had established the tradition of selecting the PRI&#x27;s next candidate and peacefully transferring power, had Rodríguez give a statement that they didn&#x27;t &quot;think extension of the presidential term or re-election is convenient for the country.&quot; This allowed for the transfer of power to President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines in 1952.

In 1964, Rodríguez attended the inauguration of President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz.

== Personal life ==
Rodríguez married three times. In 1917, he married Luisa Montijo of Guayamas. They had a son named Abelardo Luis (Rod) Rodríguez Montijo, who lived to be one hundred years old. But the couple was incompatible, so they soon separated by mutual agreement.

The second marriage was to Eathyl Vera Meier of Chicago, Illinois. They were married in Calexico in August 1921. Meier suffered from depression, which only got worse when she lost their daughter, who was born prematurely. Meier committed suicide at the Hotel Belmar in Mazatlán on 25 September 1922.

In February 1924, Rodríguez married Aída Sullivan Coya of Puebla. He was thirty-four years old, she was nineteen. They had three sons. His marriage to Sullivan was quite stable and lasted over forty years, up until Rodríguez&#x27;s death.

=== &quot;Honoris causa&quot; ===
On 15 June 1951, Rodríguez received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from the University of California, Berkeley. His son Abelardo S. graduated from UCB on the same day, with a degree in business administration.

=== Autobiography ===
Rodríguez wrote a 445-page autobiography in 1962. The &quot;Autobiografía de Abelardo L. Rodríguez&quot; was published by the Senate of the Mexican Republic, Commission of Libraries and Editorial Affairs.

=== Family tragedy ===
A family tragedy affected Rodríguez deeply in later years. In 1964, his 39-year-old son Juan Abelardo and his daughter-in-law, Janine Ratliff died when their plane collided with power lines on takeoff. The couple had four young children, whom Sullivan and Rodríguez took into their care and raised.

== Death ==
General Abelardo L. Rodríguez died at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California, on 13 February 1967.

<doc id="436356" wikidata="Q365550" url="?curid=436356" title="Dennis Weaver">
<text>Billy Dennis Weaver (June 4, 1924 – February 24, 2006) was an American actor and president of the Screen Actors Guild, best known for his work in television and films from the early 1950s until just before his death in 2006. Weaver&#x27;s two most famous roles were as Marshal Matt Dillon&#x27;s deputy Chester Goode on the western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and as Deputy Marshal Sam McCloud on the police drama &quot;McCloud&quot;. He starred in the 1971 television film &quot;Duel&quot;, the first film of director Steven Spielberg. He is also remembered for his role as the twitchy motel attendant in Orson Welles&#x27;s film &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958).

==Early life==
Weaver was born June 4, 1924, in Joplin, Missouri, the son of Walter Leon &quot;Doc&quot; Weaver and his wife Lenna Leora (&quot;née&quot; Prather). Weaver wanted to be an actor from childhood. He lived in Shreveport, Louisiana, for several years and for a short time in Manteca, California. He studied at Joplin Junior College, then transferred to the University of Oklahoma at Norman, where he studied drama and was a track star, setting records in several events. During World War II, he served as a pilot in the United States Navy, flying Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft. After the war, he married Gerry Stowell (his childhood sweetheart), with whom he had three children. Under the name Billy D. Weaver, he tried out for the 1948 U.S. Olympic team in the decathlon, finishing sixth behind 17-year-old high school track star Bob Mathias. However, only the top three finishers were selected. Weaver later commented, &quot;I did so poorly [in the Olympic Trials], I decided to ... stay in New York and try acting.&quot;

==Career==
Weaver&#x27;s first role on Broadway came as an understudy to Lonny Chapman as Turk Fisher in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba.&quot; He eventually took over the role from Chapman in the national touring company. Solidifying his choice to become an actor, Weaver enrolled in the Actors Studio, where he met Shelley Winters. In the beginning of his acting career, he supported his family by doing odd jobs, including selling vacuum cleaners, tricycles, and women&#x27;s hosiery.
In 1952, Shelley Winters helped him get a contract from Universal Studios. He made his film debut that same year in the movie &quot;The Redhead from Wyoming.&quot; Over the next three years, he played in a series of movies, but still had to work odd jobs to support his family. In 1955 he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Bullet&quot;, which is viewable on YouTube. While delivering flowers, he heard he had landed the role of Chester Goode, the limping, loyal assistant of Marshal Matt Dillon (James Arness) on the new television series &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; It was his big break; the show went on to become the highest-rated and longest-running live action series in United States television history (1955 to 1975), an honor now held by &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. He received an Emmy Award in 1959 for Best Supporting Actor (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series.

According to the Archive of American Television interview with Weaver, the producer had him in mind for Chester, but could not locate him, and was delighted when he showed up to audition. Never having heard the radio show, Weaver gave Chester&#x27;s &quot;inane&quot; dialog his best &quot;method&quot; delivery. Disappointed in his delivery, however, the producer asked for something humorous, and resurrecting &quot;a dialect from some lost county in Oklahoma,&quot; Weaver nailed it. His character&#x27;s limp came about when the producer pointed out that sidekicks usually exhibit some diminishing trait that makes them less heroic than the star. To keep from losing the part, college decathlon champion Weaver settled on using a stiff leg, something &quot;simple and consistent,&quot; allowing him still to perform all the actions needed in a Western.

In 1957, Weaver appeared as Commander B.D. Clagett in a single episode of the television series &quot;The Silent Service&quot; titled &quot;Two Davids and Goliath&quot;. Having become famous as Chester, he was next cast in an offbeat supporting role in the 1958 Orson Welles film &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, in which he played a face-twisting, body-contorting eccentric employee of a remote motel who nervously repeated, &quot;I&#x27;m the night man.&quot; In 1960, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; titled &quot;Insomnia&quot;, in which his character suffers from sleeplessness owing to the tragic death of his wife. He also co-starred in a 1961 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; titled &quot;Shadow Play&quot;. In that episode, Weaver&#x27;s character is trapped inside his own revolving nightmare, repeatedly being tried, sentenced, and then executed in the electric chair. In 1964, Weaver left &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; to star as a friendly veterinary physician raising an adopted Chinese boy as a single father in NBC&#x27;s one season comedy drama &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot;. He had a significant role in the 1966 western &quot;Duel at Diablo&quot;, with James Garner and Sidney Poitier. His next substantial role was as Tom Wedloe on the CBS family series &quot;Gentle Ben,&quot; with co-star Clint Howard, from 1967 to 1969. Decades earlier, as a student at Oklahoma University in the mid-1940s, it was Weaver who had introduced Clint&#x27;s parents, Rance Howard and Jean Speegle Howard, to one another when the three of them were theater students at OU.

In 1970, Weaver landed the title role in the NBC series &quot;McCloud,&quot; for which he received two Emmy Award nominations. In 1974, he was nominated for Best Lead Actor in a Limited Series (&quot;McCloud&quot;) and in 1975, for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series. The show, about a modern Western lawman who ends up in New York City, was loosely based on the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff.&quot; His frequent use of the affirming Southernism, &quot;There you go,&quot; became a catchphrase for the show. During the series, in 1971, Weaver also appeared in &quot;Duel,&quot; a television movie directed by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg selected Weaver based on the intensity of his earlier performance in &quot;Touch of Evil.&quot;

Weaver was also a recording artist, with most of his tracks being spoken-word recordings with musical accompaniment. He released several singles and albums between 1959 and 1984, most notable of which was his eponymous Im&#x27;press Records LP in 1972, the cover of which featured a portrait of Weaver in character as McCloud; it was the first of seven albums he recorded.

From 1973 to 1975, Weaver was president of the Screen Actors Guild.

His later series during the 1980s (both of which lasted only one season) were &quot;Stone&quot; in which Weaver played a Joseph Wambaugh-esque police sergeant turned crime novelist and &quot;Buck James&quot; in which he played a Texas-based surgeon and rancher. (&quot;Buck James&quot; was loosely based on real-life Texas doctor James &quot;Red&quot; Duke.) He portrayed a Navy rear admiral for 22 episodes of a 1983–1984 series, &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.&quot;

In 1977, he portrayed a husband who physically abuses his wife (portrayed by Sally Struthers) in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot;, one of the first network features to depict domestic violence. In 1978, Weaver played the trail boss R. J. Poteet in the television miniseries &quot;Centennial,&quot; in the installment titled &quot;The Longhorns&quot;. Weaver also appeared in many acclaimed television films, including &quot;Amber Waves&quot; (1980) with Kurt Russell. Also in 1980, he portrayed Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was imprisoned for involvement in the Lincoln assassination, in &quot;The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd&quot; and starred with his real-life son Robby Weaver in the short-lived NBC police series &quot;Stone.&quot; In 1983, he played a real estate agent addicted to cocaine in &quot;&quot;. Weaver received probably the best reviews of his career when he starred in the 1987 film &quot;Bluffing It,&quot; in which he played a man who is illiterate. In February 2002, he appeared on the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (episode DABF07, &quot;The Lastest Gun in the West&quot;) as the voice of aging Hollywood cowboy legend Buck McCoy.

For his contribution to the television industry, Dennis Weaver was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6822 Hollywood Blvd, and on the Dodge City (KS) Trail of Fame. In 1981, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers with the Bronze Wrangler Award at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Weaver as McCloud was used to promote a rock show in New York City. He also hosted segments for the Encore Westerns premium cable network in the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s.

Weaver&#x27;s last work was done on an ABC Family cable television show called &quot;Wildfire&quot;, where he played Henry Ritter, the father of Jean Ritter and the co-owner of Raintree Ranch. His role on the show was cut short by his death.

Weaver had an interest in the UFO topic and in 1986 narrated a daily toll-charge phone message service called the UFO Contact Newsline, produced in his basement and operated by his son Rusty Weaver and partner Paul Shepherd. Each three minute report featured &quot;late-breaking news of human contact with extraterrestrials, inside stories of UFO sightings and scientific verification of alien visits to planet Earth&quot; according to an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

==Personal life==
Weaver was reported to have been a vegetarian from 1958 for ethical reasons; however, he did occasionally eat fish.

Weaver married Gerry Stowell after World War II, and they had three sons: Richard, Robert, and Rustin Weaver. Gerry died April 26, 2016, at 90. 

Weaver&#x27;s home in Ridgway, Colorado, exemplified his commitment to preserving the environment. In the late 1980s, he commissioned architect Michael Reynolds to design and build his new residence, which incorporated into its construction various recycled materials, such as old automobile tires and discarded cans, and featured passive solar power and other ecotechnologies. Weaver called his home Earthship, the same name given to the design concept pioneered by Reynolds and advanced by him as part of what was then a growing interest in &quot;sustainable architecture&quot; by environmentalists. Weaver and his family lived at Earthship for over 14 years, until 2004.

In July 2003, Weaver lost a daughter-in-law, Lynne Ann Weaver, wife of son Robby Weaver, in Santa Monica, California, when a car driven at high speed plowed through shoppers at the Santa Monica Farmers Market. She was one of 10 people killed in the incident.

Weaver was a lifelong active Democrat.

==Activism==
Weaver was an environmentalist, who promoted the use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and wind power, through the Institute of Ecolonomics, a nonprofit environmental organization he established in 1993 in Berthoud, Colorado. &quot;Ecolonomics&quot; is a term formed by combining the words ecology and economics. He was also involved with John Denver&#x27;s WindStar Foundation, and he founded an organization called L.I.F.E. (Love is Feeding Everyone), which provided food for 150,000 needy people a week in Los Angeles.

Weaver was also active in liberal political causes. He used his celebrity status as a fundraiser and organizer for George McGovern&#x27;s campaign for President in 1972.

In 2004, he led a fleet of alternative-fuel vehicles across the United States to raise awareness about America&#x27;s dependence on oil.

Weaver was consistently involved with the annual Genesis Awards, which honor those in the news and entertainment media who bring attention to the plight and suffering of animals. Established by the Ark Trust, the award has been presented by the Humane Society of the United States since 2002.

==Death==
Weaver died from prostate cancer at his home in Ridgway, Colorado, on February 24, 2006, at age 81.

<doc id="436360" wikidata="Q315626" url="?curid=436360" title="Manuel Ávila Camacho">
<text>Manuel Ávila Camacho (; 24 April 1897 – 13 October 1955) was a Mexican politician and military leader who served as the President of Mexico from 1940 to 1946. Despite participating in the Mexican Revolution and achieving a high rank, he came to the presidency of Mexico because of his direct connection to General Lázaro Cárdenas and served him as a right-hand man as his Chief of his General Staff during the Mexican Revolution and afterwards. He was called affectionately by Mexicans &quot;The Gentleman President&quot; (&quot;El Presidente Caballero&quot;). As president, he pursued &quot;national policies of unity, adjustment, and moderation.&quot; His administration completed the transition from military to civilian leadership, ended confrontational anticlericalism, reversed the push for socialist education, and restored a working relationship with the US during World War II.

==Early life==
Manuel Ávila was born in Teziutlán, a small but economically important town in Puebla, to middle-class parents, Manuel Ávila Castillo and Eufrosina Camacho Bello. His older brother, Maximino Ávila Camacho, was a more dominant personality. There were several other siblings, among them a sister, María Jovita Ávila Camacho, and several brothers. Two of his brothers, Maximino Ávila Camacho and Rafael Ávila Camacho, served as governors of Puebla.

Manuel Ávila Camacho did not receive a university degree although he studied at the National Preparatory School.

==Early career==

He joined the revolutionary army in 1914 as a second lieutenant and reached the rank of colonel by 1920. The same year, he served as the chief of staff of the state of Michoacán under Lázaro Cárdenas and became his close friend. He opposed the 1923 rebellion of former revolutionary general Adolfo de la Huerta. In 1929, he fought under General Cárdenas against the Escobar Rebellion, the last serious military rebellion of disgruntled revolutionary generals, and the same year, he achieved the rank of brigadier general.

He was married to Soledad Orozco García (1904–1996), who was born in Zapopan, Jalisco, and was a member of a prominent family in Jalisco.

After his military service, Ávila Camacho entered the public arena in 1933 as the executive officer of the Secretariat of National Defense and became Secretary of National Defense in 1937. In 1940, he was elected president of Mexico after he had been nominated to represent the party that later became the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

Camacho won the controversial presidential election over right-wing candidate and revolutionary-era General Juan Andreu Almazán.

==Presidency==

=== End of conflict between church and state ===

Camacho, a professed Catholic, said, &quot;I am a believer.&quot; Since the revolution, all presidents had been anticlerical. During Camacho&#x27;s term, the conflict between the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico and the Mexican government largely ended.

==== Domestic policy ====
He protected the working class by creating the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in 1943. He worked to reduce illiteracy, continued land reform, and declared a rent freeze to benefit low-income citizens.

He promoted election reform and passed a new electoral law in 1946 to make it difficult for opposition parties of the far right and the far left to operate legally. The law established the following criteria that had to be fulfilled by any political organization to be recognized as a political party:
* have at least 10,000 active members in 10 states;
* exist for at least three years before elections;
* agree with the principles established in the constitution;
* not form alliances or be subordinated to international organizations or foreign political parties.

On 18 January 1946, he had the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM) renamed to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), its current name. The Mexican army had been a sector of the PRM, but it was eliminated from the organization of the PRI.

Economically, he pursued the country&#x27;s industrialization, which benefited only a small group, and income inequality increased. 
World War II stimulated Mexican industry, which grew by approximately 10% annually between 1940 and 1945, and Mexican raw materials fueled the US war industry.

In agriculture, his administration invited the Rockefeller Foundation to introduce Green Revolution technology to bolster Mexico&#x27;s agricultural productivity.

In education, Camacho reversed Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27;s policy of socialist education in Mexico and had the constitutional amendments that mandated it repealed.

==== Foreign policy ====

During his term, Camacho faced the difficulty of governing during World War II. After two of Mexico&#x27;s ships (&quot;Potrero del Llano&quot; and &quot;Faja de Oro&quot;) carrying oil were destroyed by German submarines in the Gulf of Mexico, Camacho declared war against the Axis powers on 22 May 1942. Mexican participation in World War II was mainly limited to an airborne squadron, the 201st (&quot;Escuadrón 201&quot;), to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. The squadron consisted of 300 men, and after receiving training in Texas, it was sent to the Philippines on 27 March 1945. On 7 June 1945, its missions started, and the squadron participated in the Battle of Luzon. By the end of the war, 5 Mexican soldiers had lost their lives in combat. Despite its short participation in the war, Mexico belonged to the victorious nations and had thus gained the right to participate in the postwar international conferences.

Mexico&#x27;s joining the conflict on the side of the Allies improved relations with the United States. Mexico provided both raw material for the conflict and also 300,000 guest workers under the Bracero program to replace some of the Americans who had left to fight in the war. Mexico also resumed diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, which had been broken off during the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas. In 1945, Mexico signed the United Nations Charter, and in 1946, it became the headquarters of the Inter-American Conference about War and Peace.

Conflicts with the United States, which had existed in the decades before his presidency, were resolved. Especially in the early years of World War II, Mexican-American relations were excellent. The United States provided Mexico with financial aid for improvements on the railway system and the construction of the Pan American Highway. Moreover, the Mexican foreign debt was reduced.

==Later life==
When his term ended in 1946, Camacho retired to work on his farm.

In 1951, President Miguel Alemán Valdés, nearing the end of his six-year term, expressed his desire to have the Constitution amended to allow him to be re-elected. Ávila Camacho and Cárdenas had former president Abelardo L. Rodríguez give a statement that they didn&#x27;t &quot;think extension of the presidential term or re-election is convenient for the country.&quot; This allowed for the transfer of power to President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines in 1954.

Ávila Camacho died at his farm of a heart ailment on 13 October 1955, aged 58.

<doc id="436363" wikidata="Q1969573" url="?curid=436363" title="Weasel word">
<text>In rhetoric, a weasel word, or anonymous authority, is a word or phrase aimed at creating an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said, when in fact only a vague, ambiguous, or irrelevant claim has been communicated. The terms may be considered informal. Examples include the phrases &quot;some people say&quot;, &quot;it is thought&quot;, and &quot;researchers believe&quot;. Using weasel words may allow one to later deny (aka weasel out of) any specific meaning if the statement is challenged, because the statement was never specific in the first place. Weasel words can be a form of and may be used in advertising, popular science, opinion pieces and political statements to mislead or disguise a biased view or unsubstantiated claim.

Weasel words can weaken or understate a controversial claim. An example of this is using terms like &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;in most respects,&quot; which make a sentence more ambiguous than it would be without them.

==Origin==
The expression &quot;weasel word&quot; may have derived from the egg-eating habits of weasels. An article published by the &quot;Buffalo News&quot; attributes the origin of the term to William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;, which include similes of weasels sucking eggs. The article claims these similes are flawed because weasels have insufficient jaw musculature to be able to suck eggs.

Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; provides an earlier source for the same etymology. Ovid describes how Juno orders the goddess of childbirth, Lucina, to prevent Alcmene from giving birth to Hercules. Alcmene&#x27;s servant Galanthis, realizing that Lucina is outside the room using magic to prevent the birth, emerges to announce that the birth has been a success. Lucina, in her amazement, drops the spells of binding, and Hercules is born. Galanthis then mocks Lucina, who responds by transforming her into a weasel. Ovid writes (in A.S. Kline&#x27;s translation) &quot;And because her lying mouth helped in childbirth, she gives birth through her mouth...&quot; Ancient Greeks believed that weasels conceived through their ears and gave birth through their mouths.

Definitions of the word &#x27;weasel&#x27; that imply deception and irresponsibility include: the noun form, referring to a sneaky, untrustworthy, or insincere person; the verb form, meaning to manipulate shiftily; and the phrase &quot;to &quot;weasel out&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;to squeeze one&#x27;s way out of something&quot; or &quot;to evade responsibility.&quot;

Theodore Roosevelt attributed the term to his friend William Sewall&#x27;s older brother, Dave, claiming that he had used the term in a private conversation in 1879.
The expression first appeared in print in Stewart Chaplin&#x27;s short story &quot;Stained Glass Political Platform&quot; (published in 1900 in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;), in which weasel words were described as &quot;words that suck the life out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks the egg and leaves the shell.&quot; Roosevelt apparently later put the term into public use after using it in a speech in St. Louis May 31, 1916. According to Mario Pei, Roosevelt said, &quot;When a weasel sucks an egg, the meat is sucked out of the egg; and if you use a weasel word after another, there is nothing left of the other.&quot;

==Forms==
A 2009 study of Wikipedia found that most weasel words in it could be divided into three main categories:
# Numerically vague expressions (for example, &quot;some people&quot;, &quot;experts&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;evidence suggests&quot;)
# Use of the passive voice to avoid specifying an authority (for example, &quot;it is said&quot;)
# Adverbs that weaken (for example, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;)

Other forms of weasel words may include these:
*Illogical or irrelevant statements
*Use of vague or ambiguous euphemisms
*Use of grammatical devices such as qualifiers, negation and the subjunctive mood
*In most languages with one, use of the first person plural pronouns e.g. we, us, our, and ours 
*Glittering or vague generalizations

&quot;Generalizing&quot; by means of quantifiers, such as &quot;many&quot;, when quantifiable measures could be provided, obfuscates the point being made, and if done deliberately is an example of &quot;weaseling.&quot;

&quot;Illogical or irrelevant statements&quot; are often used in advertising, where the statement describes a beneficial feature of a product or service being advertised. An example is the endorsement of products by celebrities, regardless of whether they have any expertise relating to the product. In non-sequitur fashion, it does not follow that the endorsement provides any guarantee of quality or suitability.

&quot;False authority&quot; is defined as the use of the passive voice without specifying an actor or agent. For example, saying &quot;it has been decided&quot; without stating by whom, and citation of unidentified &quot;authorities&quot; or &quot;experts,&quot; provide further scope for weaseling. It can be used in combination with the reverse approach of discrediting a contrary viewpoint by glossing it as &quot;claimed&quot; or &quot;alleged.&quot; This embraces what is termed a &quot;semantic ,&quot; represented by the term &quot;allegedly&quot;. This implies an absence of ownership of opinion, which casts a limited doubt on the opinion being articulated. The construction &quot;mistakes were made&quot; enables the speaker to acknowledge error without identifying those responsible.

However, the passive voice is legitimately used when the identity of the actor or agent is irrelevant. For example, in the sentence &quot;one hundred votes are required to pass the bill,&quot; there is no ambiguity, and the actors including the members of the voting community cannot practicably be named even if it were useful to do so.

The scientific journal article is another example of the legitimate use of the passive voice. For an experimental result to be useful, anyone who runs the experiment should get the same result. That is, the identity of the experimenter should be of low importance. Use of the passive voice focuses attention upon the actions, and not upon the actor—the author of the article. To achieve conciseness and clarity, however, most scientific journals encourage authors to use the active voice where appropriate, identifying themselves as &quot;we&quot; or even &quot;I.&quot;

The &quot;middle voice&quot; can be used to create a misleading impression. For example:
* &quot;It stands to reason that most people will be better off after the changes.&quot;
* &quot;There are great fears that most people will be worse off after the changes.&quot;
* &quot;Experience insists that most people will not be better off after the changes.&quot;

The first of these also demonstrates false authority, in that anyone who disagrees incurs the suspicion of being unreasonable merely by dissenting. Another example from international politics is use of the phrase &quot;the international community&quot; to imply a false unanimity.

&quot;Euphemism&quot; may be used to soften and potentially mislead the audience. For example, the dismissal of employees may be referred to as &quot;rightsizing,&quot; &quot;headcount reduction,&quot; and &quot;downsizing.&quot; Jargon of this kind is used to describe things euphemistically.

&quot;Restricting information&quot; available to the audience is a technique sometimes used in advertisements. For example, stating that a product &quot;... is now 20% cheaper!&quot; raises the question, &quot;Cheaper than what?&quot; It might be said that &quot;Four out of five people prefer ...&quot; something, but this raises the questions of the size and selection of the sample, and the size of the majority. &quot;Four out of five&quot; could actually mean that there had been 8% for, 2% against, and 90% indifferent.

<text>Miguel Alemán Valdés (; 29 September 1900 – 14 May 1983) was a Mexican politician who served a full term as the President of Mexico from 1946 to 1952, the first civilian president after a string of revolutionary generals. 

His administration was characterized by Mexico&#x27;s rapid industrialization, often called the Mexican Miracle, but also for a high level of personal enrichment for himself and his associates. His presidency was the first of a new generation of Mexican leaders who had not directly participated in the Mexican Revolution, and many in his cabinet were also young, university-educated civilians, close friends from his days at university.

==Early life and career==

Alemán was born in Sayula in the state of Veracruz, the son of revolutionary Gen. Miguel Alemán González and Tomasa Valdés Ledezma. Both had been married before, with Alemán González having a son by his first wife. They had two sons together, Carlos and Miguel. The family lived in straitened circumstances, with Miguel remembering when he was young that when huaraches hurt his feet, he would urinate on them to soften the leather. His father, Miguel Alemán González, began fighting before the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, a so-called &quot;precursor&quot; in a region of Veracruz state. He avidly read the tracts of Ricardo Flores Magón, of the Mexican Liberal Party and opposed the repressive regime of Porfirio Díaz. Alemán González left his family with his parents to fight with , the son-in-law of Venustiano Carranza against the Díaz regime. In 1920 the family moved to Mexico City, but with the accession to power of the Sonoran generals Adolfo de la Huerta, Álvaro Obregón, and Plutarco Elías Calles, Alemán González continued in opposition to the government. He was implicated in the murder of one of Obregón&#x27;s commanders, , and was on the run. The general met his end in March 1929 in a hail of bullets, probably committing suicide.

Young Miguel had experienced first-hand the disruption of the impacts of the continuing violence in Mexico. Alemán&#x27;s schooling was sporadic in his early years, because of needing to move frequently; he attended schools in Acayucan, Coatzacoalcos, and Orizaba. For a time, he worked at the British-owned Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company, where he first learned English and became fluent in it.

He recalled his father advised him of &quot;the usefulness of returning to my studies and choosing an occupation more stable than the military.&quot; Alemán did that, attending the National Preparatory School in Mexico City from 1920 to 1925, founding the newspaper &quot;Eureka&quot;. He then went to the School of Law at the National University (UNAM) until 1928, completing his law degree with his thesis on occupational diseases and accidents among workers. At UNAM, he was the leader of a group of classmates, all of whom went on the prominence in Mexican life. They included Ángel Carvajal Bernal; Manuel Sánchez Cuen, who served as subdirector of PEMEX in the Alemán administration; ; ; Manuel Ramírez Vázquez; , who became rector of UNAM during Alemán&#x27;s presidency; Antonio Carrillo Flores, who was director of the Fondo de Cultura Económica; and , head of the &quot;Confederación de Cámaras Industriales&quot;.

As a successful attorney, his first practice was in representing miners suffering from silicosis. He won two notable legal victories in representing workers against corporations—the first was in securing compensation for dependents of railroad workers who were killed in revolutionary battles, the second was to gain indemnities for miners injured at work. These victories gained him considerable favor with Mexico&#x27;s labor unions.

==Political career==
===First positions===

Alemán started public service with a relatively minor appointment as legal adviser to the Secretary of Agriculture and Livestock (1928–30). Other positions followed, including the Federal Board of Conciliation and Arbitration in 1930. In 1933, he served as the President of the Unifying Committee for Plutarco Elías Calles, which brought him into prominence. He then served as a Senator from his home state of Veracruz 1934–36, representing the Party of the Mexican Revolution (an earlier name of the party later known as the PRI). When governor-elect Manlio Favio Altamirano was assassinated, Alemán accepted appointment as governor from 1936 to 1939. The appointment can be seen as a political reward from the Cárdenas administration for helping oust Plutarco Elías Calles during the intra-party struggle. From 1940 to 1945, he served as Secretary of the Interior (&quot;Gobernación&quot;) under Manuel Ávila Camacho after directing Ávila&#x27;s national presidential campaign. As Secretary of the Interior during World War II, he dealt with Axis espionage and the clerical fascist Sinarquistas. 

==Election of 1946==
President Avila Camacho chose Alemán as the official candidate of the party in 1945, running for president in 1946. There were many possibilities for the president to choose among, both civilian and military, including Avila Camacho&#x27;s older brother, Maximino Ávila Camacho. The Avila Camacho brothers shared ill health, and Maximino died in February 1945, following a banquet. His death averted a possible political crisis of succession. &quot;There were some who wondered whether something more than seasoning had been added to Maximino&#x27;s food&quot; the day he died. Among the civilians were Javier Rojo Gómez, the head of government of the Federal District; Marte R. Gómez, Secretary of Agriculture; Dr. Gustavo Baz, secretary of Health; and Ezequiel Padilla, Secretary of Foreign Relations, and Alemán, who headed the most powerful ministry. Military men were also strong contenders, and all previous post-revolutionary presidents had participated in the Mexican Revolution. , Enrique Calderón, , and Francisco Castillo Nájera were in consideration. Alemán received the backing of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). Avila Camacho paved the way with the military for Mexico&#x27;s first civilian president in the modern era. Prior to the summer election, the &quot;Partido de la Revolución Mexicana&quot; became the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

He followed the pattern established by Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27;s campaign in 1934, so that Alemán campaigned in all parts of the country, a means by which the candidate sees all areas of the republic and voters make contact with the candidate. He was the winner of the elections held on 7 July of that year, defeating former foreign minister Ezequiel Padilla. He became the first non-military candidate to win the presidency of Mexico, although he was the son of a revolutionary army general. His own skills within the party that brought him the post of Ministry of the Interior played a key role in his selection. There was no violence surrounding the election and the transfer of power took place peacefully.

==Presidency 1946-1952==
Alemán was inaugurated as President of the Republic on 1 December 1946 and served until 1952, when barred from running from re-election, he returned to civilian life. He was enormously popular prior to his presidency and in his early years as president, but lost support in the waning days of his term.

As president he pushed the program of state-supported industrialization in Mexico and was very friendly toward business. This stance on economic development was a key reason he was tapped to be the party&#x27;s candidate rather than possible candidates with ideas similar to Cárdenas&#x27;. This period of rapid growth and industrialization has been dubbed the Mexican miracle.

===Cabinet===
 members were similar in profile to the president himself, relatively young and without military experience, and highly educated, with personal ties to him. His Secretary of the Interior, Héctor Pérez Martínez; Secretary of Public works, Ángel Carvajal; and Secretary of Labor, both Manuel Ramirez Vázquez and Andrés Serra Rojas had all been part of his close-knit group from the Faculty of Law at UNAM.

===Domestic policy===
====Infrastructure====
Alemán directed government spending to state-sponsored industrial development and reduced military spending as had his predecessors. That development included investments in infrastructure, especially public works. Dam-building helped control flooding, expand irrigation, which allowed for the expansion of large-scale agriculture, and provided hydroelectric power. In 1947 he initiated a huge project in the state of Oaxaca, culminating with the opening of the Miguel Alemán Dam in 1955. In 1951 he oversaw completion of the diversion of the Lerma River, bringing to an end Mexico City&#x27;s water supply problems.

Extending the nation&#x27;s rail network, building and improving highways brought remote regions into the national economy. In Mexico City an existing airfield was enlarged and became the Mexico City International Airport.

His administration also built a new campus for the National University (UNAM) in the south of the city, moving it from its previous location in downtown Mexico City.

In 1952 his administration elevated Baja California to state status. Also during his term, he asserted power by forced imposition of state governors.
He played a major role in the development and support of the city of Acapulco as an international tourist destination. 
Rampant political corruption and crony capitalism would mark his administration, however, and this would shape the relationship of politics and big business in Mexico until the present day. His successful economic policy led to talk about the Mexican miracle, but only a small elite benefited from economic growth. His administration took an anti-communist stance and supported the US during the Cold War.

===Foreign policy===
During his administration the close relationship with the US developed during World War II continued, although he refused to send Mexican troops to participate in the Korean War.

In 1947, on the eve of the Cold War, he created the Mexican DFS intelligence agency to support and cooperate with CIA operations in Mexico. Its stated mission was &quot;preserving the internal stability . . . against all forms of subversion&quot;.

He negotiated a major loan from the United States in 1947. Alemán and US President Harry S. Truman rode in a parade in Washington that attracted an estimated 600,000 well-wishers. 
Internationally, he signed peace agreements with Japan, Germany and Italy following World War II, had a hand in a truce between Pakistan and India and worked with the US on the issue of &quot;braceros&quot;.

==Election of 1952==

In party tradition, Alemán designated his successor as PRI presidential candidate—and the foregone expectation of the next president. He selected Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, with a reputation for honesty and probity, a sharp contrast to his own record of considerable self-enrichment in office. Before the announcement (&quot;destape&quot;), there were rumors that Alemán wanted to hold onto power and the a constitutional amendment to allow re-election or extension of his existing term was in the works. The PRI party founder, Plutarco Elías Calles had remained the power behind the presidency in the six years after president-elect Alvaro Obregón&#x27;s assassination in 1928. That power void had led to the creation of the &quot;Partido Nacional Revolucionario&quot;, and Calles called the shots during three the presidencies of Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, and Abelardo L. Rodríguez. He had expected his control to continue during the presidency of his hand-picked candidate Lázaro Cárdenas. However, Cárdenas won the power struggle with Calles, exiling him. When Cárdenas&#x27;s term was nearing its end in 1940, he did continue the tradition of the president choosing his successor and picked the more conservative Manuel Avila Camacho (1940–46). But in contrast to Calles, Cárdenas stepped away from power, and Avila Camacho was a fully empowered president. When the rumors of Alemán surfaced about seeking to hold onto power, Cárdenas vigorously objected, so although he did not directly take part in politics, he maintained a level of influence.

Unlike the peaceful change of power in 1946, 1952 was another contested presidential election. Career military officer Miguel Henríquez Guzmán sought to be the candidate of the PRI. Henriquez was backed by some important politicians, including members of the Cárdenas family, who objected to the rightward turn of the party and the government. Among those who supported Henríquez were the Mexican ambassador to the U.S.; an ex-governor of the important state of Mexico; and a number of military officers. He gathered further support from some students, peasant groups, and discontented workers. According to historian Daniel Cosío Villegas, Alemán was in contact with former President Cárdenas, warning that the Henríquez challenge was a danger to the new system. Alemán chose Adolfo Ruiz Cortines as the PRI candidate. Once announced in the &quot;destape&quot; (unveiling of the official candidate), the CTM under the leadership of Fidel Velázquez mobilized their hundreds of thousands of members behind Ruiz. The PRI offered an opening to some Catholics, which was aimed at undermining the candidate for the National Action Party, Efraín González Luna. Marxist politician and labor leader, Vicente Lombardo Toledano ran as well. In the end, the PRI defeated the opposition parties, taking 74.3% of votes cast, but opposition parties on the left and right showed that the PRI was not completely dominant. This election was the last until the election in 2000 with an open PRI campaign prior to president revealing his choice of successor.

==Post-presidency==

Alemán accumulated a fortune during his lifetime. In his post-presidential years, he directed Mexico&#x27;s tourism agency and a significant figure in the ownership of Mexican media, including the large television channel Televisa. In politics, he was the leader of the right wing of the PRI. In 1961, he was named the president of the national tourist commission, and was influential in bringing the 1968 Summer Olympics to Mexico. In addition, he was the first president of the &quot;Mr. Amigo Association&quot; in 1964, which celebrates the bi-national friendliness between the United States and Mexico in the Charro Days and Sombrero Festival celebrations held in Matamoros, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, Texas. In 1987, his memoirs, entitled &quot;Remembranzas y testimonios&quot;, were published.

His son Miguel Alemán Velasco is the CEO of Grupo Alemán (Galem), which included Interjet.

<doc id="436374" wikidata="Q3485791" url="?curid=436374" title="Polish Golden Age">
<text>The Polish Golden Age (Polish: &quot;Złoty Wiek Polski&quot; ) was the Renaissance period in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, roughly corresponding to the period of the Jagiellonian dynasty (1386-1572). Some historians argue that the Polish Golden Age continued into the mid-17th century, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was ravaged by the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–57) and by the Swedish and Russian invasion. During its Golden Age, the Commonwealth became one of the largest kingdoms of Europe and at its peak stretched from modern-day Estonia in the north to Moldavia in the south and from Moscow in the east to Brandenburg in the west.

In the 16th century the Commonwealth grew to 1 million km2, with a population of 11 million. It prospered from its enormous grain, wood, salt, and cloth trade with Western Europe via the Baltic Sea ports of Gdańsk, Elbląg, Riga, Memel, and Königsberg. The Commonwealth&#x27;s major cities also included Poznań, Kraków, Warsaw, Lwów, Wilno, Toruń, and, for a time, Kyiv and Smolensk. The Commonwealth army was able to defend the realm from foreign invasion, and also participated in aggressive campaigns against Poland&#x27;s neighbors. As voluntary Polonization followed in unified territories. The Polish language became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Central and Eastern Europe.

During its Golden Age, the Commonwealth was regarded as one of the most powerful states in Europe. It had a unique system of government, known as Golden Liberty, in which all the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;), regardless of economic status, were considered equal and enjoyed extensive legal rights and privileges. One of the system&#x27;s features was the liberum veto, used for the first time in 1669. The nobility, comprising &quot;szlachta&quot; and magnates, made up 6-8% of the Commonwealth&#x27;s population.

== Culture of Polish Renaissance ==
=== Literacy, education and patronage of intellectual endeavors ===
The Polish printing industry began in Kraków in 1473, and by the early 17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth: eight in Kraków, the rest mostly in Gdańsk, Toruń and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools, and in townspeople&#x27;s households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as by the end of the 16th century almost every parish ran a school.

The Lubrański Academy, an institution of higher learning, was established in Poznań in 1519. The Reformation resulted in the establishment of a number of gymnasiums, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the Protestant denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The Catholic reaction was the creation of Jesuit colleges of comparable quality. The Kraków University in turn responded with humanist program gymnasiums of its own.

The university itself experienced a period of prominence at the turn of the 15th/16th century, when especially the mathematics, astronomy and geography faculties attracted numerous students from abroad. Latin, Greek, Hebrew and their literatures were likewise popular. By the mid 16th century the institution entered a crisis stage, and by the early 17th century regressed into Counter-reformational conformism. The Jesuits took advantage of the infighting and established in 1579 a university college in Vilnius, but their efforts aimed at taking over the Academy of Kraków were unsuccessful. Under the circumstances many elected to pursue their studies abroad.

Sigismund I the Old, who built the presently existing Wawel Renaissance castle, and his son Sigismund II Augustus, supported intellectual and artistic activities and surrounded themselves with the creative elite. Their patronage example was followed by ecclesiastic and lay feudal lords, and by patricians in major towns.

=== Science ===
Polish science reached its culmination in the first half of the 16th century as the medieval point of view was criticized and more rational explanations were sought. &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, published by Copernicus in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into understanding of the physical universe, dispensing with the Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the expansion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.

Copernicus, a son of a Toruń trader from Kraków, made many contributions to science and the arts. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, he later studied at Italian universities. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, a political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and he led the defense of Olsztyn against the forces of Albrecht Hohenzollern. As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.

Josephus Struthius became famous as a physician and medical researcher. Bernard Wapowski was a pioneer of Polish cartography. Maciej Miechowita, a rector at the Kraków Academy, published in 1517 &quot;Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis&quot;, a treatise on the geography of the East, an area in which Polish investigators provided first-hand expertise for the rest of Europe.

Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski was one of the greatest theorists of political thought in Renaissance Europe. His most famous work, &quot;On the Improvement of the Commonwealth&quot;, was published in Kraków in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was a passionate proponent of peaceful resolution of international conflicts. Bishop Wawrzyniec Goślicki (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled &quot;De optimo senatore&quot; (&quot;The Counsellor&quot; in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.

Historian Marcin Kromer wrote &quot;De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum&quot; (On the origin and deeds of Poles) in 1555 and in 1577 &quot;Polonia&quot;, a treatise highly regarded in Europe. Marcin Bielski&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of the Whole World&quot;, a universal history, was written ca. 1550. The chronicle of Maciej Stryjkowski (1582) covered the history of Eastern Europe.

=== Literature ===
Modern Polish literature begins in the 16th century. At that time the Polish language, common to all educated groups, matured and penetrated all areas of public life, including municipal institutions, the legal code, the Church and other official uses, coexisting for a while with Latin. Klemens Janicki, one of the Renaissance Latin language poets, a laureate of a papal distinction, was of peasant origin. Another plebeian author, Biernat of Lublin, wrote his own version of Aesop&#x27;s fables in Polish, permeated with his socially radical views.

A Literary Polish language breakthrough came under the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his &quot;Brief Discourse&quot;, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.

Kochanowski was born in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the universities of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled in the village of Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski&#x27;s multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski&#x27;s best known works are bucolic &quot;Frascas&quot; (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy &quot;The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys&quot;, and the most highly regarded &quot;Threnodies&quot; or laments, written after the death of his young daughter. The poet Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński, an intellectually refined master of small forms, bridges the late Renaissance and early Baroque artistic periods.

=== Music ===
Following the European and Italian in particular musical trends, the Renaissance music was developing in Poland, centered around the royal court patronage and branching from there. Sigismund I kept from 1543 a permanent choir at Wawel Castle, while the Reformation brought large scale group Polish language church singing during the services. Jan of Lublin wrote a comprehensive tablature for the organ and other keyboard instruments. Among the composers, who often permeated their music with national and folk elements, were Wacław of Szamotuły, Mikołaj Gomółka, who wrote music to Kochanowski translated psalms, and Mikołaj Zieleński, who enriched the Polish music by adopting the Venetian School polyphonic style.

=== Architecture, sculpture and painting ===
Architecture, sculpture and painting developed also under Italian influence from the beginning of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. Francesco Fiorentino had started work on the tomb of John I Albert in 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz rebuilt the royal castle between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund&#x27;s Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century their class had gained economic strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residences to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Kraków&#x27;s Sukiennice and Poznań City Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.

Between 1580 and 1600 Jan Zamoyski commissioned the Venetian architect Bernardo Morando to build the city of Zamość. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and Mannerism aesthetic paradigms. Tombstone sculpture, often inside churches, is richly represented on graves of clergy and lay dignitaries and other wealthy individuals. Jan Maria Padovano and Jan Michałowicz of Urzędów count among the prominent artists.

The painted illuminations in the Balthasar Behem Codex are of exceptional quality, and draw their inspiration largely from Gothic art. Stanisław Samostrzelnik, a monk in the Cistercian monastery in Mogiła near Kraków, painted miniatures and polychromed wall frescos.

== Jagiellonian dynasty ==
At the end of the 15th century, the Jagiellonians reigned over vast territories stretching from the Baltic to the Black to the Adriatic Sea. The dynasty reigned in several Central European countries between the 14th and 16th centuries. Members of the dynasty were Kings of Poland (1386–1572), Grand Dukes of Lithuania (1377–1392 and 1440–1572), Kings of Hungary (1440–1444 and 1490–1526), and Kings of Bohemia (1471–1526).

In 1515, during a congress in Vienna, a dynastic succession arrangement was agreed to between Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and the Jagiellon brothers, Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary and Sigismund I of Poland and Lithuania. It was supposed to end the Emperor&#x27;s support for Poland&#x27;s enemies, the Teutonic and Russian states, but after the election of Charles V, Maximilian&#x27;s successor in 1519, the relations with Sigismund had worsened.

The Jagiellon rivalry with the House of Habsburg in central Europe was ultimately resolved to the Habsburgs&#x27; advantage. The decisive factor that damaged or weakened the monarchies of the last Jagiellons was the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Turkish expansion. Hungary&#x27;s vulnerability greatly increased after Suleiman the Magnificent took the Belgrade fortress in 1521. To prevent Poland from extending military aid to Hungary, Suleiman had a Tatar-Turkish force raid southeastern Poland–Lithuania in 1524. The Hungarian army was defeated in 1526 at the Battle of Mohács, where the young Louis II Jagiellon, son of Vladislas II, was killed. Subsequently, after a period of internal strife and external intervention, Hungary was partitioned between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.

==Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==
With the Union of Lublin, a unified Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (&quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;) was created in 1569, stretching from the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian mountains to present-day Belarus and western and central Ukraine (which earlier had been Kievan Rus&#x27; principalities). Within the new federation some degree of formal separation of Poland and Lithuania was retained (distinct state offices, armies, treasuries and judicial systems), but the union became a multinational entity with a common monarch, parliament, monetary system and foreign-military policy, in which only the nobility enjoyed full citizenship rights. Moreover, the nobility&#x27;s uppermost stratum was about to assume the dominant role in the Commonwealth, as magnate factions were acquiring the ability to manipulate and control the rest of &quot;szlachta&quot; to their clique&#x27;s private advantage. This trend, facilitated further by the liberal settlement and land acquisition consequences of the union, became apparent around the time of the 1572 death of Sigismund Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagiellonian dynasty.

One of the most salient characteristics of the newly established Commonwealth was its multiethnicity, and accordingly diversity of religious faiths and denominations. Among the peoples represented were Poles (about 50% or less of the total population), Lithuanians, Latvians, Ruthenians (corresponding to today&#x27;s Belarusians and Ukrainians), Germans, Estonians, Jews, Armenians, Tatars and Czechs, among others, for example smaller West European groups. As for the main social segments in the early 17th century, nearly 70% of the Commonwealth&#x27;s population were peasants, over 20% residents of towns, and less than 10% nobles and clergy combined. The total population, estimated at 8–10 million, kept growing dynamically until the middle of the century. The Slavic populations of the eastern lands, Rus&#x27; or Ruthenia, were solidly, except for the Polish colonizing nobility (and Polonized elements of local nobility), Eastern Orthodox, which portended future trouble for the Commonwealth.

The political doctrine of the Commonwealth was: &quot;our state is a republic under the presidency of the King&quot;. Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when he said that &quot;Rex regnat et non-gubernat&quot; (&quot;The King reigns but [&quot;lit.&quot; &#x27;and&#x27;] does not govern&quot;). The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a &quot;Senat&quot; and an elected king (&quot;Pic. 1&quot;). The king was obliged to respect citizens&#x27; rights specified in King Henry&#x27;s Articles as well as in &quot;Pacta conventa&quot;, negotiated at the time of his election.

The monarch&#x27;s power was limited in favor of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to uphold the Henrician Articles, which were the basis of Poland&#x27;s political system (and included near-unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance). Over time, the Henrician Articles were merged with the Pacta Conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones).

The foundation of the Commonwealth&#x27;s political system, the &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; (Polish: &quot;Złota Wolność&quot;, a term used from 1573 on), included:
* election of the king by all nobles wishing to participate, known as &quot;wolna elekcja&quot; (free election);
* Sejm, the Commonwealth parliament which the king was required to hold every two years;
* &quot;Pacta conventa&quot; (Latin), &quot;agreed-to agreements&quot; negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier Henrician Articles.
* &quot;religious freedom&quot; guaranteed by Warsaw Confederation Act 1573
* &quot;rokosz&quot; (insurrection), the right of szlachta to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms;
* &quot;liberum veto&quot; (Latin), the right of an individual Sejm deputy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a &quot;free veto&quot; nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the liberum veto in provincial sejmiks;
* &quot;konfederacja&quot; (from the Latin &quot;confederatio&quot;), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim.

== Livonian War; struggle for Baltic area domination ==
In the 16th century the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became increasingly interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially to gain control of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on a collision course with Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.

Other powers aspiring to the Livonian Baltic access responded by partitioning the Livonian state, which triggered the lengthy Livonian War, fought between 1558 and 1583. Ivan IV of Russia took Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva in 1558, and soon the Danes and Swedes had occupied other parts of the country. To protect the integrity of their country, the Livonians sought a union with the Polish–Lithuanian state. Gotthard Kettler, the new Grand Master, met in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) with Sigismund Augustus in 1561 and declared Livonia a vassal state under the Polish King. The agreement of November 28 called for secularization of the Brothers of the Sword Order and incorporation of the newly established Duchy of Livonia into the &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; (&quot;Republic&quot;) as an autonomous entity. The Union of Vilnius also created the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia as a separate fief, to be ruled by Kettler. Sigismund II obliged himself to recover the parts of Livonia lost to Moscow and the Baltic powers. These conflicts led to grueling wars with Russia (1558–1570 and 1577–1582) and other struggles over control of Baltic trade and freedom of navigation.

The Baltic region policies of the last Jagiellon king and his advisors were the most mature of the 16th century Poland&#x27;s strategic programs. The outcome of the efforts in that area was to a considerable extent successful for the Commonwealth. The Livonian wars came to a conclusion under the reign of King Stephen Báthory.

In 1576, Stephen Báthory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania. He turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.

== House of Vasa ==
John III of Sweden married Catherine Jagellonka, the sister of Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. When Sigismund II of Poland died without issue, the son of John III of Sweden and Catherine Jagellonka was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania as Sigismund III in 1587. On John&#x27;s death, Sigismund also gained the Swedish throne.

=== Polish-Swedish union ===
After the death of John III of Sweden, his son Sigismund became heir to the throne of Sweden. Sigismund at that time was already King of Poland (since 1587). Sigismund certainly valued the Swedish throne and upon learning about the death of his father, and the pretensions to the throne of his uncle, Duke Charles of Södermanland, he asked the Sejm (Polish parliament) for permission to leave the Commonwealth and go to Sweden, where he could temporarily secure the Swedish crown. The Sejm gave him permission, and on 3 August 1593, Sigismund, accompanied by his wife, Anna of Habsburg, and other followers, departed for Sweden.

The agreement of 19 February seemed to have calmed the situation; Sigismund was crowned in the Cathedral of Uppsala and became the king of Sweden. The Kingdom of Sweden was now in a personal union with Poland-Lithuania. In July, Sigismund left Sweden in the hands of the regency council and returned to Poland. Sweden was to be ruled jointly by the Privy Council of Sweden and Sigismund&#x27;s uncle Duke Charles.

Sigismund, however, reneged on his earlier promises, opening Catholic schools, and giving Catholics prominent posts. Charles in turn did not give up on acquiring the Swedish throne and pursued his own political agenda. The new Riksdag he summoned at Arboga in 1597 – again despite the King&#x27;s orders – saw few participants, and only one from the Privy Council. Even so, Duke Charles did not achieve support for his military action, but initiated it nonetheless. Parts of southern Sweden were successfully taken. Several of the Privy Council members fled to Poland to convince Sigismund to take counteractions. Sigismund sent a diplomatic mission, in an attempt to solve the conflict by negotiations. Charles at first looked ready to negotiate but in fact he was playing for time, trying to confirm his power at another Riksdag (in Arboga), recruiting peasants for his army, and isolating Sigismund&#x27;s followers.

In 1598, the Sejm gave Sigismund the go-ahead to wage a military campaign against his opponents in Sweden; however, it refused to give him significant support. Sigismund&#x27;s army was composed mostly of mercenaries (Germans and Hungarians), supported by a relatively small Polish force (although with some artillery).

Sigismund&#x27;s campaign was poorly planned. He was unable to coordinate his troop movements with his supporters, particularly Fleming who was supposed to attack Charles from Finland. After initial successes (the taking of Kalmar and defeating Charles&#x27; troops at Stegeborg), Sigismund&#x27;s forces were defeated on September 25, 1598, at the Battle of Stångebro, (also known as the battle of Linköping). Sigismund was captured and forced to hand over some of his followers such as the Chancellor of Sweden, Erik Larsson Sparre, (1550–1600). In May 1599, Charles&#x27; forces captured the last fortress held by Sigismund, Kalmar. On July 24, 1599, the Riksdag in Stockholm officially dethroned Sigismund. The new King of Sweden was Charles IX of Sweden, and the Polish–Swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence. In March 1600, some of Sigismund&#x27;s supporters were executed, including five senators in an event known as the Linköping Bloodbath.

== Polish invasion of Russia ==
=== Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) ===
The Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618), in Poland known as the &quot;Dimitriads&quot;, was a sequence of military conflicts and eastward invasions carried out by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and private armies and mercenaries led by the Commonwealth aristocracy, when the Russian Tsardom was torn by a series of civil wars, a period referred to as the &quot;Time of Troubles&quot;. The sides and their goals changed several times during this conflict: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was not formally at war with Russia until 1609, and various Russian factions fought amongst themselves, allied with the Commonwealth and other countries or fighting against them. Sweden also participated in the conflict during the course of the Ingrian War (1610–1617), sometimes allying itself with Russia, and other times fighting against it. The aims of the various factions changed frequently as well as the scale of their goals, which ranged from minor border adjustments to imposing the Polish Kings or the Polish-backed impostors&#x27; claims to the Russian throne and even the creation of a new state by forming a union between the commonwealth and Russia.

The war can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, certain commonwealth szlachta (nobility), encouraged by some Russian boyars (Russian aristocracy), but without the official consent of the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa, attempted to exploit Russia&#x27;s weakness and intervene in its civil war by supporting the impostors for the tsardom, False Dmitriy I and later False Dmitriy II, against the crowned tsars, Boris Godunov and Vasili Shuiski. The first wave of the Polish intervention began in 1605 and ended in 1606 with the death of False Dmitri I. The second wave started in 1607 and lasted until 1609, when Tsar Vasili made a military alliance with Sweden. In response to this alliance, the Polish king Sigismund III decided to intervene officially and to declare war upon Russia, aiming to weaken Sweden&#x27;s ally and to gain territorial concessions.

Hetman of the Crown Stanisław Żółkiewski held a triumphal entry by the Kraków suburb of the Royal Palace, leading with him the prisoners: the Russian tsar Wasyl IV Szujski, his brothers: Dimitri Szujski with his wife - Grand Duchess Ekaterina Grigoryevna, daughter Grigory Malyuta Skuratov and Ivan Shuysky Mikhail Shein, and Filaret, the non-canonical Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia.

After early commonwealth victories (Battle of Klushino), which culminated in Polish forces entering Moscow in 1610, Sigismund&#x27;s son, Prince Władysław of Poland, was briefly elected tsar. However, soon afterwards, Sigismund decided to seize the Russian throne for himself. This alienated the pro-Polish supporters among the boyars, who could accept the moderate Władysław, but not the pro-Catholic and anti-Eastern Orthodox Sigismund. Subsequently, the pro-Polish Russian faction disappeared, and the war resumed in 1611, with the Poles being ousted from Moscow in 1612 but capturing the important city of Smolensk (see &quot;Siege of Smolensk (1609–1611)&quot;). However, due to internal troubles in both the Commonwealth and Russia, little military action occurred between 1612 and 1617, when Sigismund made one final and failed attempt to conquer Russia. The war finally ended in 1618 with the Truce of Deulino, which granted the Commonwealth certain territorial concessions, but not control over Russia, which thus emerged from the war with its independence unscathed.

<text>() is a Latin phrase that means &quot;first, do no harm&quot;. The phrase is sometimes recorded as .

Non-maleficence, which is derived from the maxim, is one of the principal precepts of bioethics that all students in healthcare are taught in school and is a fundamental principle throughout the world. Another way to state it is that, &quot;given an existing problem, it may be better not to do something, or even to do nothing, than to risk causing more harm than good.&quot; It reminds healthcare personnel to consider the possible harm that any intervention might do. It is invoked when debating the use of an intervention that carries an obvious risk of harm but a less certain chance of benefit.

Non-maleficence is often contrasted with its complement, beneficence. Young and Wagner argued that, for healthcare professionals and other professionals subject to a moral code, in general beneficence takes priority over non-maleficence (“first, do good,” not “first, do no harm”) both historically and philosophically. Indeed, beneficence is the Hippocratic priority both in the Oath and in &quot;Epidemics I&quot;, which &quot;First do no harm&quot; and &quot;Primum non nocere&quot; reverse quite contrarily to Hippocratic and other classical authorities.

== Origin ==
The origin of the phrase is uncertain. Some early versions of the Hippocratic Oath include the promise &quot;to abstain from doing harm&quot; () but do not include the precise phrase. Perhaps the closest approximation in the Hippocratic Corpus is in &quot;Epidemics&quot;: &quot;The physician must ... have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm&quot; (book I, sect. 11, trans. Adams, ).

According to Gonzalo Herranz, Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Navarra, &quot;Primum non nocere&quot; was introduced into American and British medical culture by Worthington Hooker in his 1847 book &quot;Physician and Patient&quot;. Hooker attributed it to the Parisian pathologist and clinician Auguste François Chomel (1788–1858), the successor of Laennec in the chair of medical pathology, and the preceptor of Pierre Louis. Apparently, the axiom was part of Chomel&#x27;s oral teaching. Hooker, however, was quoting an earlier work by Elisha Bartlett who, on pages 288–289, says &quot;The golden axiom of Chomel, that it is only the second law of therapeutics to do good, its first law being this – not to do harm – is gradually finding its way into the medical mind, preventing an incalculable amount of positive ill.&quot; However, Hooker used neither the specific expression, nor the traditional Latin phrase. 

A detailed investigation of the origins of the aphorism was reported by the clinical pharmacologist Cedric M. Smith in the April 2005 issue of &quot;The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology&quot;. It addresses the questions of the origin and chronology of appearance of the maxim. Rather than being of ancient origin as usually assumed, the specific expression, and its even more distinctive associated Latin phrase, has been traced back to an attribution to Thomas Sydenham (1624–1689) in a book by Thomas Inman (1860), &quot;Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine&quot;. Inman&#x27;s book and his attribution were reviewed by an author who signed simply as &quot;H. H.&quot; in &quot;The American Journal of the Medical Sciences&quot;, also in 1860. Smith&#x27;s article also reviews the various uses of the now popular aphorism, its limitations as a moral injunction, and its increasingly frequent use in a variety of contexts.

The origin stories are probably apocryphal, and the true origins in either language, or any language, misty and proverbial.

An American surgeon, L.A. Stimson, used the expression in 1879 and again in 1906 (in the same journal). That it was in common use by the 20th century is apparent from later mentions, such as by the prominent obstetrician J. Whitridge Williams in 1911, as well as detailed discussion of its use in a popular book authored by Dr. Morris Fishbein, editor of &quot;The Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in 1930.

<doc id="436380" wikidata="Q5517369" url="?curid=436380" title="Gait belt">
<text>A gait belt or transfer belt is a device put on a patient who has mobility issues, by a caregiver prior to that caregiver moving the patient. Patients may have problems with balance and a gait belt may be used to aid in the safe movement of a patient, from a standing position to a wheelchair, for example. The gait belt has been customarily made out of cotton webbing, with a durable metal buckle on one end. Cleanable vinyl gait belts were introduced due to the tendency of webbing to harbor supergerms.

== Purpose and use ==
Gait belts are worn around a patient&#x27;s waist. Their purpose is to put less strain on the lumbar spine of the patient as the caregiver(s) are transporting the patient. Gait belts are used in nursing homes, hospitals, or other similar facilities. It is a 2-inch-wide (5 cm) belt, with or without handles. The gait belt must always be applied on top of clothing or gown to protect the patient&#x27;s skin. A gait belt can be used with patients in both one-person or two-person pivot transfer, or in transfer with a slider board.

== Problems ==
With the advent of supergerms, such as MRSA and VRE, trying to limit the ways germs are transmitted is a major concern for the healthcare industry. Identifying proper methods for cleaning webbed belts is an issue that most healthcare facilities are struggling with. Organizations like the Joint Commission, OSHA and the CDC are constantly updating their recommendations for cleaning inanimate objects like the gait belt. An antimicrobial vinyl gait belt was patented by Barry Chapman in 2013.

== When required by law ==
When required by law, nursing homes may be fined if a patient is hurt during transport and subsequent investigations show the patient was not wearing a gait belt. On September 13, 2017, Douglas Manor nursing home in Windham, Connecticut, was fined $1,530 after a patient sustained several injuries when staff failed to use the gait belt when assisting with transfer.

==OSHA guidelines==
The OSHA website offers current practice guidelines for the use of gait belts. The guidelines point out that more than one caregiver may be needed, and that belts with padded handles are easier to grip. It further states that gait belts are never to be used as restraints or on patients with G-tubes, and are avoided with patients who have catheters.

<text>RAF Fighter Command was one of the commands of the Royal Air Force. It was formed in 1936 to allow more specialised control of fighter aircraft. It operated throughout the Second World War, winning fame during the Battle of Britain in 1940. The command continued until November 1943, when it was disbanded and the RAF fighter force was split into two categories, defence and attack. The defensive force became Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) and the offensive force became the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. ADGB was renamed Fighter Command in October 1944 and continued to provide defensive patrols around Britain. It was disbanded for the second time in 1968, when it was subsumed by the new Strike Command.

== Origins ==
On 20 May 1926, the forerunner of Fighter Command was established as a group within Inland Area. On 1 June, Fighting Area was transferred to the Air Defence of Great Britain. Fighting Area was raised to command status in 1932 and renamed Fighter Command on 1 May 1936. On 23 February 1940, No. 60 Group RAF was established within Fighter Command to control Chain Home radar detection and tracking units.

== Second World War ==

=== Battle of Britain ===
During the late 1930s Fighter Command expanded greatly and replaced its obsolete biplane squadrons – generally outfitted with Bristol Bulldog, Gloster Gauntlet and Hawker Fury biplane fighters leading up to, and through the period of its founding – with the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire. Fighter Command was tested during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940 when the German Luftwaffe launched an offensive aimed at attaining air superiority over the Channel and the UK as a prerequisite to the launch of a seaborne invasion force (codenamed Operation Sea Lion). Fighter Command was divided into several groups, each defending a different part of the UK. 11 Group took the brunt of the German attack, as it controlled southeast England and London. It was reinforced by 10 Group, which covered southwest England, 12 Group, which covered the Midlands and East Anglia, and 13 Group, which covered the North of England and Scotland. 14 Group was established on 26 June 1940. 60 Group was established to run the Chain Home radar stations in early 1940. In the end, the Germans failed to attain air superiority, although the RAF had been eating severely into its reserves during the battle, as had the Luftwaffe.

=== 1941 air offensive ===
By May 1941, the squadrons based at all the main fighter airfields operated in wings, under the tactical control of the new post of wing leader, a survivor of 1940 with the rank of wing commander. Fighter Command began a campaign to gain air superiority over northwestern France. Short-penetration fighter operations were used to draw the into a war of attrition and keep as many German fighters in the west, particularly after the Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the Soviet Union, began in June 1941. Large Spitfire formations were sent out with a few medium bombers to lure the German fighters into combat. The left &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 2 (JG 2) and Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) in western Europe, comprising 180 fighters at most.

The advantages enjoyed by Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain were reversed, the short range of the Spitfire becoming a tactical disadvantage and British pilots became prisoners of war if shot down. Fighter Command claimed 711 fighters shot down but only 236 were lost from all causes, 103 in combat, for a loss of 400 RAF fighters. As 1941 ended, the appearance of the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190, considerably superior to the Spitfire Mk V, put the British fighters at a worse disadvantage.

The Blitz of 1940 continued against civilian and industrial targets. Fighter Command night defences improved considerably in the new year; the Bristol Beaufighter supplanted the Bristol Blenheim as the principal night fighter, equipped with improved aircraft interception radar, and became increasingly effective in ground-controlled interception (GCI).

=== 1942–45 ===

The difficult task of slowly grinding down the Germans continued into 1942 and 1943. Squadrons also found themselves on tiring defensive patrols as small formations of Fw 190s flew &#x27;hit and run&#x27; nuisance raids along the south coast and the Hawker Typhoon came into squadron service. On 19 August, during the Dieppe Raid, the RAF had an opportunity to engage large numbers of aircraft. The Spitfire squadrons (42 with Mark Vs, and four with Mark IXs) flew ground-attack, escort and air-superiority sorties and prevented the from interfering in the ground and sea battle, claiming 106 victories. Postwar analysis showed that the RAF lost 106 aircraft, including 88 fighters and 18 bombers; 29 fighter losses were from flak, one ran out of fuel, two collided and one was a victim of friendly fire. The actual loss was 48 aircraft, 28 being bombers, half of them Dornier Do 217s from KG 2. JG 2, lost 14 Fw 190s and eight pilots killed, JG 26 lost six Fw 190s with their pilots. Spitfire losses stood at 70 destroyed and damaged to all causes; the number lost to Fw 190s is unknown. The claimed 61 of the 106 RAF machines lost, which included all types, JG 2 claiming 40 and JG 26 claiming 21. In 1942 Fighter Command claimed 560 victories against a true loss of 272 German fighters from all causes, for 574 RAF day fighters destroyed.

By the autumn of 1942, the arrival of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 8th Air Force and its daylight bombers added bomber escort to Fighter Command&#x27;s tasks. Until American Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter groups were operational in May 1943, the command&#x27;s Spitfires performed a key role in protecting the increasing numbers of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators operating over Occupied Europe. The Spitfire&#x27;s chronic lack of operational range – not unlike the Bf 109E&#x27;s dilemma during the Battle of Britain – meant such protection was limited to the Channel and the European coast. The Spitfire had a range of only .

In February 1944, Fighter Command was split into the Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB), the former name of Fighter Command, to defend Britain, and the Second Tactical Air Force, to support ground forces after the invasion of Europe. On 15 July, No. 14 Group RAF (established 26 June 1940) was disestablished. In 1944 ADGB made the greatest effort in its history during Operation Overlord, the invasion of France which began on 6 June. RAF and Allied fighter units suppressed the meagre German air opposition and supported ground forces by strafing German positions and transport. Later that year, the final test of ADGB (renamed Fighter Command in October 1944) in the war occurred against the V-1 flying bomb during Operation Crossbow. RAF fighters also flew long-range night intruder operations against German airfields and aircraft (e.g. at take-off/landing) at the time the night fighters would be scrambled against RAF Bomber Command (see Operation Hydra).

In January 1945, Fighter Command included 10, 11, 12 and 13 Groups, plus 38 (Airborne Forces) Group, 60 Group, and 70 (Training) Group. 10 Group was disestablished on 2 May 1945, and 70 Group on 17 July 1945. In 1946, 60 Group was amalgamated with 26 Group to become 90 (Signals) Group and transferred to Transport Command/British Air Force of Occupation. From 1939 to 1945, RAF Fighter Command lost 3,690 killed, 1,215 wounded and 601 POW; 4,790 aircraft were lost.

== Royal Observer Corps ==
As a direct result of its efforts during the Battle of Britain the Observer Corps was granted the title Royal by King George VI and became a uniformed volunteer branch of the RAF from April 1941 for the remainder of its existence as the Royal Observer Corps (ROC).

The corps continued as a civilian organisation but wearing a Royal Air Force uniform and administered by Fighter Command. With their headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory, the ROC remained administered by Fighter Command until 31 March 1968, when responsibility was handed over to the newly formed RAF Strike Command.

The ROC was a defence warning organisation operating in the UK between 1925 and 31 December 1995, when it was stood down. Initially established for an aircraft recognition and reporting role that lasted through both world wars, the organisation switched to a Cold War nuclear reporting role during the 1950s. The Royal Observer Corps consisted of some 10,500 volunteers.

== Cold War years ==

In the aftermath of World War II, the role of Fighter Command was still to protect the UK from air attack. Only the threat had changed, from Germany to the Soviet Union. The Cold War saw the possibility of Soviet Air Forces bombers attacking the UK. A Canadian fighter wing, No. 1 Wing, arrived at RAF North Luffenham in late 1951 to bolster NATO&#x27;s strength, and was in a position to assist Fighter Command until it relocated to bases in France and West Germany in 1954–55. After 1949, those Soviet bombers could be carrying nuclear weapons, and so intercepting them was crucial if the UK was to be saved during a war. A long succession of fighter aircraft saw service with Fighter Command during the 1950s and 1960s, including the Gloster Meteor, Hawker Hunter, Gloster Javelin and English Electric Lightning.

The Lightning was the only purely British supersonic aircraft to enter service, owing to a defence review in 1957. During the mid-1950s, the performance of the new surface-to-air missiles was improving quickly. Duncan Sandys, the Minister of Defence at the time, needed to find cuts in the British defence budget since the UK was in serious danger of being bankrupted by its defence spending. The rate of improvement of surface-to-air missiles seemed to indicate that they would soon be able to shoot down any manned aircraft. Consequently, in the 1957 Defence White Paper, the Sandys review declared that manned aircraft were obsolescent and would soon become obsolete. All programmes for manned aircraft that were not too far along were cancelled.

In 1961, RAF Fighter Command was assigned to NATO&#x27;s air defence system. On 1 May, Air Officer Commanding in Chief, Fighter Command, Air Marshal Sir Hector McGregor, assumed the additional title of Commander United Kingdom Air Defence Region. The ADR itself stretched some hundreds of miles to the north, west and south of the country and almost to the continental coastline in the east.

In organisational terms, Nos 11 (14 July 1936 – 31 December 1960, 1 January 1961 - 1 April 1963) and 12 Groups (1 April 1937 – 31 March 1963) continued in almost unbroken service until 1963. No.13 Group (15 March 1939 – 20 May 1946) was reformed on 16 May 1955 and then disbanded 31 December 1961 at RAF Ouston (becoming 11 Group). From 1 April 1963 three sectors, No. 11 Sector RAF; No. 12 Sector RAF; and No. 13 Sector RAF were maintained. 13 Sector disbanded by amalgamation with No. 11 Sector on 17 March 1965.

== Strike Command ==
As the 1960s dawned, the RAF continued to shrink. The three functional commands, Fighter Command, Bomber Command, and Coastal Command, had all been formed in 1936 to help reorganise an expanding RAF. It was now becoming clear that the RAF was becoming too small to justify their continued existence as separate entities. Consequently, in 1968, Fighter Command and Bomber Command were amalgamated to form Strike Command, and became groups within the new command. Coastal Command was disbanded and subsumed into Strike Command in November 1969.

<text>Gunnar Milton Hansen (March 4, 1947 – November 7, 2015) was an Icelandic-born American actor and author. He played the mentally impaired cannibal Leatherface in &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974).

==Early life==
Hansen was born in Reykjavík, Iceland, to Icelander Skúli Hansen, a dentist, and Norwegian Sigrid Hansen. He moved to the United States with his mother and brother when he was five years old. He lived in Maine until age eleven, when his family moved to Austin, Texas, where he attended Austin High School and the University of Texas at Austin. He majored in English and mathematics as an undergraduate and then went to graduate school in Scandinavian Studies and English.

==Career==
His first job out of high school was as a computer operator before he began theater work during college. He was also a football player during high school and for a while a bar bouncer. In 1973, just after finishing graduate school, Hansen heard that &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was being filmed in Austin and decided to audition. He got the part of Leatherface, the masked killer in the movie.

After writing (and occasionally editing) for magazines and writing books, Hansen returned to acting in 1988, appearing in the horror spoof &quot;Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers&quot;. He acted in 20 films thereafter, including &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot; as one of the Sawyers. He state that he considered his later acting as a side project and continued to write books. He also wrote film scripts and wrote and directed documentary films.

His final film project was a cameo in &quot;Death House&quot;, which he co-wrote with Harrison Smith.

Hansen was also an author; his nonfiction travel memoir, &quot;Islands at the Edge of Time; A Journey to America&#x27;s Barrier Islands&quot;, was published in 1993. In 2013 he wrote the nonfiction book &quot;Chain Saw Confidential&quot; about the making of and reception for &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;.

==Death==
Hansen died at his home in Northeast Harbor, Maine, of pancreatic cancer on November 7, 2015, at the age of 68.

<text>Flora Danica is a comprehensive atlas of botany from the Age of Enlightenment, containing folio-sized pictures of all the wild plants native to Denmark, in the period from 1761 to 1883.

==History==
&quot;Flora Danica&quot; was proposed by G. C. Oeder, then professor of botany at the Botanic Garden in Copenhagen, in 1753 and was completed 123 years later, in 1883. The complete work comprises 51 parts and 3 supplements, containing 3,240 copper engraved plates. The original plan was to cover all plants, including bryophytes, lichens and fungi native to crown lands of the Danish king, that is Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg-Delmenhorst and Norway with its North Atlantic dependencies Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. However, changes were made due to territorial cessations during the period of publication. After 1814, when the double monarchy of Denmark–Norway was abolished, very few Norwegian plants were included, and similar changes were seen after 1864, when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were ceded. However, in the mid-19th-century era of Scandinavism, the &quot;Nordiske Naturforskermøde&quot; in Copenhagen proposed to make Flora Danica a Scandinavian work. Thus, three supplementary volumes were issued, containing the remaining Norwegian plants and the more important plants only occurring in Sweden.

Oeder travelled extensively in the regions covered by the proposed Flora. The illustrations were produced by Michael Rössler (1705–1777), a skilled engraver from Nuremberg, and his son, Martin Rössler (1727–1782), who drew the plants on field trips with Oeder.

The first ten issues appeared with a total of 600 plates. To produce the illustrations, both Rösslers moved to Copenhagen in 1755 and remained there until the end of their lives, with Michael becoming a copper engraver. Their illustrations are considered the best in Flora Danica, and set a benchmark in botanical illustration. Later illustrators were Johann Christian Thornam (1822–1908), Christian F. Mueller (1748–1814), the brother of the botanist editor Otto Friedrich Müller, for volumes 12 to 21, and Johann Theodor Bayer (1782–1873), for volumes 22–46, accounting for some 1500 plates.

=== Publishers/editors through time ===
==Dinner set==
In 1790 the Danish Crown Prince Frederik ordered a dinner set made decorated with exact copies of the plates of &quot;Flora Danica&quot;. The dinner set was meant as a gift for Russian Empress Catherine II. Catherine, however, never received it, as she died in 1796. It is currently on display at Christiansborg Palace, Amalienborg Palace and Rosenborg Castle.

The dinner set is still in use for special occasions in the Danish royal family (latest occasions 1980 &amp; 2022). Copies of the set are sold by the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Manufactory.

<text>The Nogat is a long delta branch of the Vistula River in northern Poland. Unlike the main river, it does not empty into Gdańsk Bay, but rather into the Vistula Lagoon.

The Nogat has its origin near the village of Biała Góra as a distributary of the Vistula River. Shortly afterwards, the river Liwa flows into the Nogat. The river then passes Malbork and flows north-east towards Elbląg (but does not reach the city). North-west of Elbląg, the Nogat flows into the south-western part of the Vistula Lagoon.

The river was located within the Kingdom of Poland until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. During the interwar period, the Nogat formed the boundary between Germany and the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk). It again became part of Poland in 1945, following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II.

<doc id="436407" wikidata="Q1808721" url="?curid=436407" title="Sound poetry">
<text>Sound poetry is an artistic form bridging literary and musical composition, in which the phonetic aspects of human speech are foregrounded instead of more conventional semantic and syntactic values; &quot;verse without words&quot;. By definition, sound poetry is intended primarily for performance.

==History and development==

===20th century===
While it is sometimes argued that the roots of sound poetry are to be found in oral poetry traditions, the writing of pure sound texts that downplay the roles of meaning and structure is a 20th-century phenomenon. The Futurist and Dadaist Vanguards of the beginning of this century were the pioneers in creating the first sound poetry forms. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti discovered that onomatopoeias were useful to describe a battle in Tripoli where he was a soldier, creating a sound text that became a sort of a spoken photograph of the battle. Dadaists were more involved in sound poetry and they invented different categories:
*&quot;Bruitist poem&quot; it is the phonetic poem, not so different from the futurist poem. Invented by Richard Huelsenbeck.
*&quot;Simultaneous poem&quot; a poem read in different languages, with different rhythms, tonalities, and by different persons at the same time. Invented by Tristan Tzara.
*&quot;Movement poem&quot; is the poem accompanied by primitive movements.

===Later developments===
Sound poetry evolved into visual poetry and concrete poetry, two forms based in visual arts issues although the sound images are always very compelling in them. Later on, with the development of the magnetic tape recorder, sound poetry evolved thanks to the upcoming of the concrete music movement at the end of the 1940s. Some sound poetics were used by later poetry movements like the beat generation in the fifties or the spoken word movement in the 80&#x27;s, and by other art and music movements that brought up new forms such as text sound art that may be used for sound poems which more closely resemble &quot;fiction or even essays, as traditionally defined, than poetry&quot;.

===Early examples===

&quot;Das Große Lalulá&quot; (1905) by Christian Morgenstern, in the collection &quot;Galgenlieder&quot;.
:::Kroklokwafzi? Semememi!
:::Seiokrontro – prafriplo:
:::Bifzi, bafzi; hulalemi:
:::quasti basti bo...
:::Lalu lalu lalu lalu la!

:::Hontraruru miromente
:::zasku zes rü rü?
:::Entepente, leiolente
:::klekwapufzi lü?
:::Lalu lalu lalu lalu la!

:::Simarar kos malzipempu
:::silzuzankunkrei (;)!
:::Marjomar dos: Quempu Lempu
:::Siri Suri Sei [ ]!
:::Lalu lalu lalu lalu la!

&quot;Zang Tumb Tumb&quot; (1914) is a sound poem and concrete poem by Italian futurist F. T. Marinetti.

Hugo Ball performed a piece of sound poetry in a reading at Cabaret Voltaire in 1916:
:&quot;I created a new species of verse, &#x27;verse without words,&#x27; or sound poems...I recited the following:
:::gadji beri bimba
:::glandridi lauli lonni cadori...&quot;
::::(Albright, 2004)

Kurt Schwitters&#x27; &quot;Ursonate&quot; (1922–32, &quot;Primal Sonata&quot;) is a particularly well known early example:

The first movement rondo&#x27;s principal theme being a word, &quot;fmsbwtözäu&quot; pronounced &quot;Fümms bö wö tää zää Uu&quot;, from a 1918 poem by Raoul Hausmann, apparently also a sound poem. Schwitters also wrote a less well-known sound poem consisting of the sound of the letter W. (Albright, 2004)

Chilean Vicente Huidobro&#x27;s explores phonetic mutations of words in his book &quot;Altazor&quot; (1931).

In his story &quot;The Poet at Home&quot;, William Saroyan refers to a character who practices a form of pure poetry, composing verse of her own made-up words.

==Female practitioners==

It has been argued that &quot;there is a paucity of information on women&#x27;s involvement in sound poetry, whether as practitioners, theorists, or even simply as listeners&quot;. Among the earliest female practitioners are Berlin poet Else Lasker-Schüler, who experimented in what she called &quot;Ursprache&quot; (Ur-language), and the New York Dada poet and performer Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. The Baroness&#x27;s poem &quot;Klink-Hratzvenga (Death-wail)&quot; was published in &quot;The Little Review&quot; in March 1920 to great controversy. Written in response to her husband Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven&#x27;s suicide, the sound poem was &quot;a mourning song in nonsense sounds that transcended national boundaries&quot;. The Baroness was also known for her sexually charged sound poetry, as seen in &quot;Teke Heart (Beating of Heart)&quot;, only recently published.

Europe has produced sound poets in the persons of Greta Monach (Netherlands) and Katalin Ladik (Hungary), who released an EP of her work, &quot;Phonopoetica&quot;, in 1976. In England, Paula Claire has been working with improvisational sound since the 1960s. Lily Greenham, born in Vienna in 1924 and later based in Denmark, Paris and London, developed a so-called neo-semantic approach during the 1970s. She coined the term &#x27;Lingual Music&#x27; to describe her electroacoustic experiments with tape recordings of her voice. During the 1950s she became involved with the Wiener Gruppe (Vienna Group) and was an accomplished performer of sound &amp; concrete poetry by many artists such as Alain Arias-Misson, Bob Cobbing, Gerhard Rühm, and Ernst Jandl. This was due in part to her training as an operatic singer and the fact that she was fluent in eight languages. &quot;Lingual Music&quot;, a double CD collection of her work, was released posthumously in 2007 by Paradigm Discs in the UK. Her archive is now held at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The United States has produced accomplished sound poets as well: Tracie Morris, from Brooklyn, New York, began presenting sound poetry in the mid-1990s. Her live and installation sound poetry has been featured in numerous venues including the Whitney Biennial in 2002. Experimental vocalist and composer Joan La Barbara has also successfully explored the realm of sound poetry. Composer Beth Anderson has been featured on several sound poetry anthologies such as &quot;10+2: 12 American Text Sound Pieces&quot; (1975) and the Italian 3vitre series. Other women practicing sound poetry in the US were, for instance, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono, Laurie Anderson and the Australian poet Ada Verdun Howell.

The online mixtape &quot;A Sound Poetry Mix Tape&quot; (2021) features excerpts by over thirty female sound poets.

==Other examples of sound poets==

Later prominent sound poets include Henri Chopin, Bob Cobbing, Ada Verdun Howell, bpNichol, Bill Bissett, Adeena Karasick, William S. Burroughs, Giovanni Fontana, Bernard Heidsieck, Enzo Minarelli, François Dufrene, Mathias Goeritz, Maurizio Nannucci, Andras Petocz, Joan La Barbara, Paul Dutton, multidisciplinary artists Jeremy Adler, Jean-Jacques Lebel, John Giorno, Henrik Aeshna,Steve Dalachinsky, Yoko Ono and Jaap Blonk.

The poet Edith Sitwell coined the term abstract poetry to describe some of her own poems which possessed more aural than literary qualities, rendering them essentially meaningless: &quot;The poems in &quot;Façade&quot; are &quot;abstract&quot; poems—that is, they are patterns of sound. They are...virtuoso exercises in technique of extreme difficulty, in the same sense as that in which certain studies by Liszt are studies in transcendental technique in music.&quot; (Sitwell, 1949)

An early Dutch artist, Theo van Doesburg, was another prominent sound poet in the early 1900s.

The comedian and musician Reggie Watts often uses sound poetry as an improvisational technique in his performances, used with the intent to disorient his audience.

==Theories==

In their essay &quot;Harpsichords Metallic Howl—&quot;, Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo review the theories of sound by Charles Bernstein, Gerald Bruns, Min-Quian Ma, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Jeffrey McCaffery and others to argue that sonic poetry foregrounds its own corporality. Thus &quot;the Baroness&#x27;s sound poems let her body speak[;] through her expansive use of sound, the Baroness conveys the fluidity of gender as a constantly changing, polysemous signifier.&quot; In this way, somatic art becomes the poet&#x27;s own &quot;space-sound.&quot;

Of course, for many dadaists, such as Hugo Ball, sound poetry also presented a language of trauma, a cacophony used to protest the sound of the cannons of World War I. It was as T. J. Demos writes, &quot;a telling stutter, a nervous echolalia.&quot;

<text>Victor John Angelo Raschi (March 28, 1919 – October 14, 1988) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. Nicknamed &quot;the Springfield Rifle&quot;, he was one of the top pitchers for the New York Yankees in the late 1940s and early 1950s, forming (with Allie Reynolds and Eddie Lopat) the &quot;Big Three&quot; of the Yankees&#x27; pitching staff. He also pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Athletics.

From 1946 to 1953, Raschi won 120 games for the Yankees while losing 50, a .706 winning percentage. He pitched in three straight All-Star Games from 1948 to 1950, and a fourth in 1952. Raschi led the American League (AL) in won/lost percentage in 1950 (.724) and in strikeouts in 1951 (164). From 1949 through 1951, he won exactly 21 games a year, ranking second in the AL in wins in 1950 and 1951. After pitching in relief for the Yankees in the 1947 World Series, Raschi won five World Series in a row with the ballclub from 1949 to 1953, pitching a shutout in Game 1 of the 1950 World Series. Later in his career, as a pitcher with the Cardinals, he allowed Hank Aaron&#x27;s first MLB career hit and first MLB career home run. In the remaining two years of his career, with the Cardinals and Athletics, Raschi won only 12 games while losing 16.

==Early life==
Born March 28, 1919, in West Springfield, Massachusetts, Victor John Angelo Raschi was one of four children of Massimino and Eugizia Raschi. Massimino worked for a local railroad as a carpenter, and the family moved to Springfield when Raschi was just an infant. At Springfield Tech High School, Raschi excelled in baseball, football, and basketball. Gene McCann, a scout for the New York Yankees became interested in him as a high school freshman, but Raschi wished to attend college upon graduating. The Yankees decided to pay for him to go to college in return for the first chance to sign him. In 1938, he started attending the College of William and Mary. Before he graduated, the Yankees had him begin pitching minor league baseball for them in 1941, though Raschi would continue to take classes at William and Mary during his offseasons.

==Minor league career and military service==
Raschi started his professional career with the Amsterdam Rugmakers of the Class C Canadian–American League in 1941. Making 17 appearances for them, he posted a 10–6 record in 142 innings pitched. His 3.68 earned run average (ERA) ranked fourth in the league among pitchers who worked at least 140 innings. He also appeared in 17 games in 1942 for the Class B Norfolk Tars of the Piedmont League, working 113 innings. Though he posted a 4–10 record, his ERA was 2.71, which Lawrence Baldassaro of the Society for American Baseball Research called &quot;impressive.&quot; However, Raschi&#x27;s career was placed on hold with the onset of World War II.

For the next three years, Raschi served in the United States Army Air Corps as a physical education instructor. The war also forced him to postpone his college studies. He returned to baseball in 1946 with the Binghamton Triplets of the Class A Eastern League. He had a 10–10 record for them, posting a 3.16 ERA and finishing second in the league with 160 strikeouts (behind Bob Kuzava&#x27;s 207). Later in the year, he appeared in five games for the Newark Bears of the Class AAA International League, posting a 1–2 record. In September, he was promoted to the Yankees for the first time.

==New York Yankees (1946–1953)==
===1946===
Raschi&#x27;s debut for New York came on September 23, 1946. Facing the Philadelphia Athletics, he struck out eight and allowed six runs, but the Yankees scored nine, giving him the win. He made one other start six days later, also a complete game against the Athletics, in which he allowed one run in a two-run triumph in Game 2 of a doubleheader.

===1947===
Hoping to remain with the Yankees for 1947, Raschi was very disappointed when he was sent to the Class AAA Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League to start the season. He initially refused to report, but when he finally did join the team, manager Jim Turner helped him become a better pitcher. With Portland, Raschi posted an 8–2 record and a 2.75 ERA in 85 innings pitched.

In July, an injury to Spud Chandler and the trade of Mel Queen left the Yankees in need of a pitcher for a July 13 doubleheader. Yankee manager Bucky Harris phoned Turner on the 10th, and after Raschi made a start in San Diego that evening, Turner asked him if he could be ready to pitch again three days later. Raschi agreed, then found out his next start would be for the Yankees. Pitching the second game of the doubleheader, he gave up three runs in innings as the Yankees defeated the Chicago White Sox by a score of 6–4. On July 18, he allowed six hits in a complete game, 7–2 victory over the Cleveland Indians, the last of a 19-game winning streak for New York. Facing the Indians again in the second game of an August 7 doubleheader, he threw a three-hit shutout. He won his first six decisions of 1947 before suffering his first loss in a game that biographer Lawrence Baldassaro called &quot;one of his best outings of the year.&quot; For 10 innings, he held the Boston Red Sox (the previous year&#x27;s American League (AL) pennant winners) scoreless, but the Yankees also failed to score, and Raschi took the loss when he allowed three runs in the 11th. On September 14, he defeated the St. Louis Browns; the win meant the Yankees would at least tie for the AL pennant. In 15 games (14 starts), he had a 7–2 record, a 3.87 ERA, 51 strikeouts, 38 walks, and 89 hits allowed in innings for the pennant-winning Yankees. He pitched twice in relief in the 1947 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, allowing two hits and a run in of an inning in Game 3 and throwing a scoreless inning in Game 6. Both were losses, but the Yankees defeated Brooklyn in seven games, making Raschi a World Series champion for the first time.

===1948===
Raschi started the 1948 season with the Yankees; after losing his first start, he won nine decisions in a row. He shut out Philadelphia on May 14, allowing just three hits. On June 2, he threw a shutout against the Detroit Tigers, singling against Art Houtteman and scoring the only run of the game when Johnny Lindell drove him in with a double. He threw a second consecutive shutout in Game 2 of a doubleheader against the Browns on June 6, holding St. Louis to three hits. Selected to his first All-Star Game in 1948, Raschi earned the win after pitching three scoreless innings and driving in the winning run with a two-RBI single against Johnny Schmitz. Facing the Indians on August 7, he threw a four-hit shutout in front of 66,693 fans at Cleveland Stadium in a game that drew the Yankees within half a game of the AL lead. He was 17–5 with a 3.31 ERA after holding the Athletics to four hits in a shutout on August 22, but he posted an ERA of 6.00 in his final 11 games as the Yankees finished in third place. Raschi had a 19–8 record and a 3.84 ERA, ranking among the AL leaders in wins (tied with Bob Feller for fourth), winning percentage (.704, third, behind Jack Kramer&#x27;s .783 and Gene Bearden&#x27;s .741), strikeouts (124, fifth), and shutouts (six, tied for second with Bearden behind Feller&#x27;s 10). He finished 11th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting.

===1949===

Facing the Washington Senators in his first start of 1949 on April 20, Raschi held them to three hits in a 3–0 victory. On May 18, Raschi allowed just two hits in a shutout of the defending champion Indians. Against the White Sox on June 1, he limited Chicago to three hits in a 3–0 shutout victory. At midseason, he was selected to the All-Star Game, throwing three scoreless innings in the AL&#x27;s 11–7 win. He was 15–3 with a 2.55 ERA through July 21, but he went 2–6 over his next 10 games, posting a 5.58 ERA from that date through the end of August. On August 4, he pitched 11 innings against the Tigers, allowing three runs in 3–2 loss. He had a 3.30 ERA in September, though, losing once in five decisions. In 1949, the pennant race between the Yankees and the Red Sox came down to the final day of the season, October 2 at Yankee Stadium. Pitching for New York, Raschi held the Red Sox scoreless for eight innings, clinging to a one-run lead until the Yankees scored four runs in the eighth. He gave up three runs in the ninth but persevered, retiring Birdie Tebbetts on a pop fly to end the game as the Yankees prevailed by a score of 5–3. Thirty-nine years later, this game was considered by pitching coach Turner to be his favorite of Raschi&#x27;s performances. Raschi went 21–10 in 1949, finishing among the AL leaders in wins (fourth, behind Mel Parnell&#x27;s 25, Ellis Kinder&#x27;s 23, and Bob Lemon&#x27;s 22), winning percentage (.677, eighth), ERA (3.34, eighth), and strikeouts (124, sixth). He led the AL with 37 starts. For the second year in a row, he finished 11th in AL MVP voting.

Against the Dodgers in the 1949 World Series, Raschi made two starts. He threw a complete Game 2, with an RBI single by Gil Hodges accounting for the only run. However, the Yankees lost 1–0. Manager Casey Stengel said afterwards, &quot;Raschi pitched a good game; good enough to win if we got some runs.&quot; Raschi allowed six runs over innings in Game 5 but earned the win, clinching the series victory for the Yankees. &quot;It would have been nice to be around at the finish,&quot; Raschi said, &quot;but I have no complaints as long as we won. That&#x27;s the important thing.&quot;

===1950===
An arm injury suffered on May 13, 1950, caused Raschi to miss a few days, but he returned on May 22 to pitch a complete game five-hitter against the Indians as the Yankees won 5–2, continuing a seven-game winning streak. In the first game of a June 11 doubleheader, he held the Browns to three hits in a 1–0 victory. He started the All-Star Game for the first time in 1950, allowing two runs in three innings, though he got a no decision in the AL&#x27;s 4–3 loss. Facing Feller on August 4, he pitched a three-hit shutout in a 1–0 victory over the Indians, as 66,743 fans turned out to see the night game at Cleveland Stadium. Five days later, he had a perfect game going against the Red Sox until Billy Goodman got a single with two outs in the seventh; Raschi held Boston to three hits and one run in a 2–1 victory. After losing on August 13, Raschi never lost a game again during the regular season, winning each of his next six starts and eight of 10 games overall. On August 29, he hit his first career home run (a three-run shot against Early Wynn), then pitched all 10 innings of a 6–5 victory over the Indians. In one of the August games against Cleveland, he collided with Indians catcher Jim Hegan at home plate, tearing cartilage in his right knee. The Yankees kept the injury a secret, as the injury limited Raschi&#x27;s range; after the 1951 season, he would have surgery to remove the cartilage. He finished 1950 with a 21–8 record and a 4.00 ERA, leading the AL in winning percentage (.724), ranking second in wins (21, two behind Lemon for the lead), and ranking third in strikeouts (155, behind Lemon&#x27;s 170 and teammate Allie Reynolds&#x27;s 160). In MVP voting, he finished seventh.

With the Yankees AL champions again, Stengel picked Raschi to start Game 1 of the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. During the first inning, he injured his knee while fielding a bunt off the bat of Richie Ashburn and almost had to leave the game, but the knee stopped hurting, allowing him to finish. He did not allow a hit until the fifth inning and allowed just two in a 1–0 shutout of the Phillies. &quot;I mixed [my pitches] up pretty good,&quot; Raschi described his performance. &quot;Feeling the way I did, I went along using sliders and fast balls, but it was my fast ball that won for me.&quot; It was his only start of the series, which New York won four games to none.

===1951===

In 1951, Raschi made the first of three straight Opening Day starts for the Yankees. &quot;The excitement before an opening game is as great, I think, as the World Series,&quot; he later recalled, emphasizing the importance of getting the season started well. He started the season with a six-hit shutout of the Red Sox. In May, he won six straight starts. Included in the streak were a 10-strikeout performance against the Indians (May 16) and a five-hit shutout of the Browns (May 21). On June 8, Raschi held the Chicago White Sox to seven hits in a 4–2 victory, ending their six-game win streak in a game that set a Comiskey Park attendance record at the time with 53,490 spectators. Exactly a week later, he held the Tigers to three hits in a 2–0 shutout. He limited the Red Sox to three hits on June 29 in a 2–1 triumph. Despite a 12–6 record at the All-Star break, Raschi was not selected to the All-Star Game, partly because the AL owners decreed that only one pitcher could be selected from each team. In the first game of a doubleheader on July 29, he struck out 12 White Sox and pitched into the ninth inning, earning the win in an 8–3 victory. Facing the Senators in the second game of a September 9 doubleheader, he pitched a one-hit shutout, though the game lasted only six innings. Raschi finished the year with a 21–10 record. He led the AL in strikeouts (164), finishing second in wins (tied with teammate Eddie Lopat behind Feller&#x27;s 22), fourth in winning percentage (.677, behind Feller&#x27;s .733, Lopat&#x27;s .700, and Reynolds&#x27;s .680), second in shutouts (four, tied with Feller and Lopat behind Reynolds&#x27;s seven), and eighth in ERA (3.27). The Yankees again won the AL pennant, and Raschi finished eighth in AL MVP voting.

Facing the New York Giants in Game 3 of the World Series, Raschi lasted just innings, taking the loss in a 6–2 defeat. He allowed all six Giant runs, but only one was earned because of two fifth inning errors: shortstop Phil Rizzuto had a ball kicked out of his hand by Eddie Stanky, and catcher Yogi Berra dropped a ball thrown to him. Another error (a passed ball allowed by Berra) led to all the scoring against Raschi in Game 6 as the Giants only picked up one run against him in six innings. Johnny Sain and Kuzava finished the game for the Yankees, and Raschi earned the win in the 4–3 triumph that clinched the series for the Yankees. Hall of Famer Monte Irvin, who played for the Giants, thought that Raschi was one of the best pitchers he had ever seen.

===1952===
Raschi&#x27;s received a $40,000 contract for the 1952 season, making him at the time the highest-paid pitcher in Yankee history. On April 16, 1952, Raschi allowed just two hits in an 8–1 victory over the Athletics, though he was removed from the game in the ninth inning after walking three batters. He pitched back-to-back shutouts against the Browns and the Indians on June 8 (doubleheader, second game) and June 14, striking out 13 against the Browns. The starter in that year&#x27;s All-Star Game, he allowed one run in two innings, taking a no decision in the AL&#x27;s 3–2 loss. Against the Tigers in the first game of a July 13 doubleheader, Raschi was four outs away from throwing a no hitter when Joe Ginsberg hit a home run off him. Ginsberg&#x27;s blast was the only hit for the Tigers as the Yankees won 11–1. In an important July 17 doubleheader against the Indians, who were fighting the Yankees for the pennant in 1952, Raschi pitched a complete Game 2, allowing four runs in a 5–4 victory. On August 4, he allowed just six hits and struck out eight in a 1–0 shutout victory over the Senators. He threw a six-hit shutout in a 1–0 victory over the Indians on August 23 in front of the largest crowd at Yankee Stadium up to that point in the season, a total of 53,747 fans. In 31 starts, Raschi had a 16–6 record. He ranked among the AL&#x27;s leaders in wins (sixth), winning percentage (.727, second to Bobby Shantz&#x27;s .774), ERA (2.78, eighth), strikeouts (127, ninth), and shutouts (four, tied with Early Wynn and Billy Pierce for fifth). Of AL MVP candidates, he ranked 17th in the voting.

As the Yankees had won the AL pennant again, Raschi played in the World Series against the Dodgers, where he made two starts and a relief appearance. He was a little wild in Game 2, walking five batters, but he only allowed three hits and one earned run as the Yankees defeated the Dodgers by a score of 7–1. He hit an RBI single off of Billy Loes&#x27; leg in Game 6 and held the Dodgers to two runs before getting removed as he tired with two outs in the eighth inning, but Reynolds finished off the 3–2 victory. In Game 7, he entered in the seventh inning with the Yankees clinging to a 4–2 lead, but still tired, he retired only one hitter while allowing the Dodgers to load the bases. Bob Kuzava bailed him out, however, and the Yankees won their fourth straight World Series.

===1953===
Despite a 3–3 record in his first 10 games of 1953, Raschi posted a 5.05 ERA; some of his early starts were &quot;not too impressive,&quot; according to sportswriter John Drebinger. In front of 74,708 fans in Cleveland on June 14 in the second game of a doubleheader, he allowed just three hits in a shutout of the Indians. Raschi had what sportswriter Louis Effrat called a &quot;magnificent pitching performance&quot; on July 2, allowing three runs while pitching all 10 innings of a 5–3 victory over the Red Sox, a win that snapped a nine-game losing streak for the Yankees. He pitched a two-hit shutout in Chicago against the White Sox on July 19, in the second game of a doubleheader that broke the Comiskey Park attendance record, as 54,215 fans bought tickets. On August 4, Raschi recorded seven RBI against the Tigers with a two-RBI single in the second inning, a three-RBI double in the third, and a two-RBI single in the fourth in a 15–0 victory. The seven RBI set what remains an AL record for a pitcher in a game, and they were a major league record for pitchers until Tony Cloninger drove in nine runs on July 3, 1966. After the game, the Yankees stuffed Raschi&#x27;s locker with bats as a tribute. He threw back-to-back shutouts on August 16 (doubleheader, first game) and 23, both against the Athletics. From June 14 through the rest of the season, he had a 2.54 ERA. In 28 games (26 starts), he had a 13–6 record and 76 strikeouts. He ranked among the AL leaders in winning percentage (.684, fifth) and ERA (3.33, ninth).

For the fourth time in his career, Raschi and the Yankees faced the Dodgers in the World Series. In Game 3, he and opposing pitcher Preacher Roe allowed their opponents just two runs until the eighth inning, when Raschi gave up a solo home run to Roy Campanella that made the difference in a 3–2 score. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t quite a strike, but I just didn&#x27;t get it quite high enough, and Campy belted it,&quot; he said of the home run pitch. Raschi made no further appearances in the series but became a World Series champion for the sixth time and fifth year in a row as the Yankees defeated the Dodgers in six games.

In 1954, the Yankees tried to cut Raschi&#x27;s salary by 25%. The pitcher held out in spring training, seeking more money, but so did 11 other Yankees. Wanting the holdouts to accept his offers, general manager George Weiss decided that one needed to go. He also was trying to develop a younger ballclub and planned to trade either Raschi or Reynolds. On February 24, 1954, Raschi was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for $85,000. He found out about the trade from a photographer, and the only notification he had from the Yankees was a telegram. &quot;It&#x27;s baseball, I guess,&quot; he told reporters about the trade. &quot;What hurts me most is leaving the team-mates I&#x27;ve grown so fond of.&quot; From 1946 to , he had won 120 games while losing 50, a .706 winning percentage.

==St. Louis Cardinals (1954–1955) and Kansas City Athletics (1955)==

With the Cardinals, Raschi got off to a 5–0 start, not losing until June. In a game against the Milwaukee Braves on April 15, he allowed Hank Aaron&#x27;s first hit, a double. Eight days later, he gave up the first home run to Aaron, who would go on to set an MLB record with 755 career home runs. On May 19, he pitched a five-hit shutout in a 3–0 victory over the Giants. After that game, however, he won just once in 12 games (11 starts) through July 18. He threw another shutout against the Giants on July 29, allowing just three hits this time. The victory moved his record to 8–5, but Raschi lost his four remaining decisions. In 30 games (29 starts), he had an 8–9 record, a 4.73 ERA, and 73 strikeouts in 179 innings pitched.

Back trouble afflicted Raschi in 1955; Red Smith wrote in April, &quot;Raschi&#x27;s back feels like a hollow tooth.&quot; He was unable to pitch for much of the spring, drawing reports that he might be released, until he finally solidified his spot on the roster with a five-inning performance at the end of spring training. After he failed to get through the second inning in his first start of the regular season, on April 18, the Cardinals released him on April 19.

On April 26, Raschi signed with the Athletics, who had moved from Philadelphia to Kansas City after the previous season. He posted a 7.33 ERA in his first six games with them, failing to pitch more than six innings. On June 11, he pitched a complete game, striking out six and allowing one run in a 2–1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. In his first game against the Yankees since his departure, on July 22, Raschi held the Yankees to one run over eight innings, earning the win in a 3–1 victory that temporarily knocked them out of first place in the AL. He held the Yankees to two runs over seven innings in his next start but took a no decision in a 3–2 loss. After defeating the Red Sox on August 5, he had a 4–4 record with a 4.59 ERA. However, Raschi failed to complete five innings in any of his remaining starts, losing three times and posting an ERA of 11.34. In 20 games (18 starts) for Kansas City, he had a 4–6 record, a 5.42 ERA, and 38 strikeouts in innings pitched. The Athletics released him after the season.

==Career statistics and uniform numbers==
In 269 games (255 starts), Raschi had a 132–66 record, a 3.72 ERA, 944 strikeouts, and 26 shutouts in 1,819 innings. He recorded a .977 fielding percentage, committing only 8 errors in 351 total chances. Offensively, he had a .184 career batting average and 50 RBI. He had 11 RBI apiece in 1948 and 1953.

Raschi wore uniform number 12 in his first two games for the Yankees. The next year, he wore three different numbers (17, 19, and 43), settling with number 17 in succeeding seasons. He kept his uniform number 17 on the Cardinals, but on the Athletics, he wore number 16.

==Pitching style==
Raschi&#x27;s best pitch was his speedy fastball. He was nicknamed &quot;The Springfield Rifle,&quot; a reference both to the pitch and to the Springfield Armory located near his boyhood home. Turner recalled, &quot;He had good control for a power pitcher.&quot; In addition to the fastball, Raschi threw a changeup and a slider, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;effective.&quot; Under his dark eyebrows, his eyes would stare intently at opponents before he threw pitches. &quot;I figured if I could break their concentration when they came up to the plate I had them beat, or at least gained an advantage. Once you made them turn their eyes away you had a slight psychological edge.&quot; &quot;He’d keep his eyes on their eyes, like a boxer before a fight,&quot; Berra described the stare.

==Legacy==
Raschi appeared on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot nine times, though he received more than 1.8 percent of the vote only twice: 1964 (four percent) and 1975 (10.2 percent, his last year on the ballot). &quot;He was our bread-and-butter guy,&quot; said teammate Jerry Coleman. &quot;Allie Reynolds had a better arm, but Raschi was a great competitor. Off the field he was shy and unassuming, nothing like he was on the mound. There he was a beast. Casey considered him our best starter.&quot; &quot;I thought Raschi was the best pitcher I had on the team for nine innings. . . . Boy, he was the best on the club in the eighth and ninth inning,&quot; Stengel assessed his ability. &quot;If there was only one game I had to win, the man I’d want out there on the mound for me would be Vic Raschi,&quot; explained teammate Tommy Henrich. With Reynolds and Lopat, Raschi &quot;was the keystone of one of the most acclaimed pitching staffs in the history of major league baseball,&quot; according to reporter Robert Thomas Jr. The &quot;Big Three&quot; won 53 games in 1949, 55 in 1950, and 59 in 1951.

==Personal life, post-retirement==
Raschi met his future wife, Sally Glen, while both were students at William and Mary. They were married in 1949 and had three children: Victoria, William, and Mitje. Sally earned her degree from William and Mary in 1944. Vic, after returning from the war, took classes from October to February, finally graduating himself in 1949. While Vic played for the Yankees, he and Sally lived in Hillsdale, New Jersey. Following his retirement, they moved to Geneseo, New York. Vic ran the Valley Liquor Store in Geneseo and served as a baseball and basketball coach at Geneseo State Teachers College (now the State University of New York at Geneseo). In 1975, the college dedicated the Victor J. Raschi Baseball Field, which is now used as a softball field. Raschi also taught at a local elementary school starting in 1969. He died on October 14, 1988, in Groveland, New York, of a heart attack.

<text>Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are highly specific for sugar groups that are part of other molecules, so cause agglutination of particular cells or precipitation of glycoconjugates and polysaccharides. Lectins have a role in recognition at the cellular and molecular level and play numerous roles in biological recognition phenomena involving cells, carbohydrates, and proteins. Lectins also mediate attachment and binding of bacteria, viruses, and fungi to their intended targets.

Lectins are found in many foods. Some foods, such as beans and grains, need to be cooked, fermented or sprouted to reduce lectin content. Some lectins are beneficial, such as CLEC11A, which promotes bone growth, while others may be powerful toxins such as ricin.

Lectins may be disabled by specific mono- and oligosaccharides, which bind to ingested lectins from grains, legumes, nightshade plants, and dairy; binding can prevent their attachment to the carbohydrates within the cell membrane. The selectivity of lectins means that they are useful for analyzing blood type, and they have been researched for potential use in genetically engineered crops to transfer pest resistance.

==Etymology==
William C. Boyd alone and then together with Elizabeth Shapleigh introduced the term &quot;lectin&quot; in 1954 from the Latin word &quot;lectus&quot;, &quot;chosen&quot; (from the verb &quot;legere&quot;, to choose or pick out).

==Biological functions==
Lectins may bind to a soluble carbohydrate or to a carbohydrate moiety that is a part of a glycoprotein or glycolipid. They typically agglutinate certain animal cells and/or precipitate glycoconjugates. Most lectins do not possess enzymatic activity.

===Animals===
Lectins have these functions in animals:
* The regulation of cell adhesion
* The regulation of glycoprotein synthesis
* The regulation of blood protein levels
* The binding of soluble extracellular and intercellular glycoproteins
* As a receptor on the surface of mammalian liver cells for the recognition of galactose residues, which results in removal of certain glycoproteins from the circulatory system
* As a receptor that recognizes hydrolytic enzymes containing mannose-6-phosphate, and targets these proteins for delivery to the lysosomes; I-cell disease is one type of defect in this particular system.
* Lectins are known to play important roles in the innate immune system. Lectins such as the mannose-binding lectin, help mediate the first-line defense against invading microorganisms. Other immune lectins play a role in self-nonself discrimination and they likely modulate inflammatory and autoreactive processes. Intelectins (X-type lectins) bind microbial glycans and may function in the innate immune system as well. Lectins may be involved in pattern recognition and pathogen elimination in the innate immunity of vertebrates including fishes.

===Plants===
The function of lectins in plants (legume lectin) is still uncertain. Once thought to be necessary for rhizobia binding, this proposed function was ruled out through lectin-knockout transgene studies.

The large concentration of lectins in plant seeds decreases with growth, and suggests a role in plant germination and perhaps in the seed&#x27;s survival itself. The binding of glycoproteins on the surface of parasitic cells also is believed to be a function. Several plant lectins have been found to recognize noncarbohydrate ligands that are primarily hydrophobic in nature, including adenine, auxins, cytokinin, and indole acetic acid, as well as water-soluble porphyrins. These interactions may be physiologically relevant, since some of these molecules function as phytohormones.

Lectin receptor kinases (LecRKs) are believed to recognize damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are created or released from herbivore attack. In &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, legume-type LecRKs Clade 1 has 11 LecRK proteins. LecRK-1.8 has been reported to recognize extracellular NAD molecules and LecRK-1.9 has been reported to recognize extracellular ATP molecules.

Extraction of proteins and lectins can be extracted via similar processes, also with their analysis, and discovery. For example cottonseed contains compounds of interest within the studies of extraction and purification of proteins

===Bacteria and viruses===
Some hepatitis C viral glycoproteins may attach to C-type lectins on the host cell surface (liver cells) to initiate infection. To avoid clearance from the body by the innate immune system, pathogens (e.g., virus particles and bacteria that infect human cells) often express surface lectins known as adhesins and hemagglutinins that bind to tissue-specific glycans on host cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Multiple viruses, including influenza and several viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family, use this mechanism to bind and gain entry to target cells.

==Use==
===In medicine and medical research===
Purified lectins are important in a clinical setting because they are used for blood typing. Some of the glycolipids and glycoproteins on an individual&#x27;s red blood cells can be identified by lectins.
* A lectin from &quot;Dolichos biflorus&quot; is used to identify cells that belong to the A1 blood group.
* A lectin from &quot;Ulex europaeus&quot; is used to identify the H blood group antigen.
* A lectin from &quot;Vicia graminea&quot; is used to identify the N blood group antigen.
* A lectin from &quot;Iberis amara&quot; is used to identify the M blood group antigen.
Non blood-group antigens can be identified by lectins:
* A lectin from coconut milk is used to identify &quot;Theros&quot; antigen.
* A lectin from &quot;Carex&quot; is used to identify R antigen.
In neuroscience, the anterograde labeling method is used to trace the path of efferent axons with PHA-L, a lectin from the kidney bean.

A lectin (BanLec) from bananas inhibits HIV-1 &quot;in vitro&quot;. Achylectins, isolated from &quot;Tachypleus tridentatus&quot;, show specific agglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes. Anti-B agglutinins such as anti-BCJ and anti-BLD separated from &quot;Charybdis japonica&quot; and &quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;, respectively, are of value both in routine blood grouping and research.

===In studying carbohydrate recognition by proteins===

Lectins from legume plants, such as PHA or concanavalin A, have been used widely as model systems to understand the molecular basis of how proteins recognize carbohydrates, because they are relatively easy to obtain and have a wide variety of sugar specificities. The many crystal structures of legume lectins have led to a detailed insight of the atomic interactions between carbohydrates and proteins.

Legume seed lectins have been studied for their insecticidal potential and have shown harmful effects for the development of pest.

===As a biochemical tool===
Concanavalin A and other commercially available lectins have been used widely in affinity chromatography for purifying glycoproteins.

In general, proteins may be characterized with respect to glycoforms and carbohydrate structure by means of affinity chromatography, blotting, affinity electrophoresis, and affinity immunoelectrophoreis with lectins, as well as in microarrays, as in -field fluorescence-assisted lectin microarray.

===In biochemical warfare===
One example of the powerful biological attributes of lectins is the biochemical warfare agent ricin. The protein ricin is isolated from seeds of the castor oil plant and comprises two protein domains. Abrin from the jequirity pea is similar:
* One domain is a lectin that binds cell surface galactosyl residues and enables the protein to enter cells.
* The second domain is an N-glycosidase that cleaves nucleobases from ribosomal RNA, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death.

==Dietary lectin==

Lectins are widespread in nature, and many foods contain the proteins. Some lectins can be harmful if poorly cooked or consumed in great quantities. They are most potent when raw as boiling, stewing or soaking in water for several hours can render most lectins inactive. Cooking raw beans at low heat, though, such as in a slow cooker, will not remove all the lectins.

Some studies have found that lectins may interfere with absorption of some minerals, such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, and zinc. The binding of lectins to cells in the digestive tract may disrupt the breakdown and absorption of some nutrients, and as they bind to cells for long periods of time, some theories hold that they may play a role in certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, but research supporting claims of long-term health effects in humans is limited and most existing studies have focused on developing countries where malnutrition may be a factor, or dietary choices are otherwise limited.

===Lectin-free diet===

The first writer to advocate a lectin-free diet was Peter J. D&#x27;Adamo, a Naturopath best known for promoting the Blood type diet. He argued that lectins may damage a person&#x27;s blood type by interfering with digestion, food metabolism, hormones, insulin production—and so should be avoided. D&#x27;Adamo provided no scientific evidence nor published data for his claims, and his diet has been criticized for making inaccurate statements about biochemistry.

Steven Gundry proposed a lectin-free diet in his book &quot;The Plant Paradox&quot; (2017). It excludes a large range of commonplace foods including whole grains, legumes, and most fruit, as well as the nightshade vegetables: tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, and chili peppers. Gundry&#x27;s claims about lectins are considered pseudoscience. His book cites studies that have nothing to do with lectins, and some that show—contrary to his own recommendations—that avoiding the whole grains wheat, barley, and rye will allow increase of harmful bacteria while diminishing helpful bacteria.

==Toxicity==
Lectins are one of many toxic constituents of many raw plants that are inactivated by proper processing and preparation (e.g., cooking with heat, fermentation). For example, raw kidney beans naturally contain toxic levels of lectin (e.g. phytohaemagglutinin). Adverse effects may include nutritional deficiencies, and immune (allergic) reactions.

===Hemagglutination===
Lectins are considered a major family of protein antinutrients, which are specific sugar-binding proteins exhibiting reversible carbohydrate-binding activities. Lectins are similar to antibodies in their ability to agglutinate red blood cells.

Many legume seeds have been proven to contain high lectin activity, termed hemagglutination. Soybean is the most important grain legume crop in this category. Its seeds contain high activity of soybean lectins (soybean agglutinin or SBA).

==History==
Long before a deeper understanding of their numerous biological functions, the plant lectins, also known as phytohemagglutinins, were noted for their particularly high specificity for foreign glycoconjugates (e.g., those of fungi and animals) and used in biomedicine for blood cell testing and in biochemistry for fractionation.

Although they were first discovered more than 100 years ago in plants, now lectins are known to be present throughout nature. The earliest description of a lectin is believed to have been given by Peter Hermann Stillmark in his doctoral thesis presented in 1888 to the University of Dorpat. Stillmark isolated ricin, an extremely toxic hemagglutinin, from seeds of the castor plant (&quot;Ricinus communis&quot;). 

The first lectin to be purified on a large scale and available on a commercial basis was concanavalin A, which is now the most-used lectin for characterization and purification of sugar-containing molecules and cellular structures. The legume lectins are probably the most well-studied lectins.

<text>Rhithropanopeus harrisii (common names include the Zuiderzee crab, dwarf crab, estuarine mud crab, Harris mud crab, white-fingered mud crab, and white-tipped mud crab) is a small omnivorous crab native to Atlantic coasts of the Americas, from New Brunswick to Veracruz.

&quot;R. harrisii&quot; is usually found in brackish water, but can also be found in freshwater. It likes to live on stones and in oyster beds. The crab can reach a maximum size of . It has an olive-green-brownish color, sometimes with dark spots on its carapace.

It is a common inhabitant of Texas and Florida estuaries, but was later introduced all over the world. In 1937, it was discovered to be invading the San Francisco Bay&#x27;s brackish waters and adjacent fresh waters of the California Central Valley. It was also recently discovered in the Third Lock Lake in Panama, a man-made lake intended to be a part of the Panama Canal.

&quot;R. harrisii&quot; was first discovered in Europe in the Zuider Zee, the Netherlands, and is now also found in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, Poland, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Romania and Bulgaria, from the Black Sea and Caspian Sea.

In the British Isles, &quot;R. harrisii&quot; has only been observed in Roath Docks, Cardiff, which have lower salinity (12‰) than the surrounding waters.

Breeding freshwater populations have been found in the Brazos River basin in Texas, notably the Possum Kingdom State Park and Lake Granbury. Populations have also been discovered in Lake Texoma and Lake E.V. Spence. Its presence in the Baltic Sea is blamed for a negative ecosystem shift.

A record of this species was made in Brazil, but might represent a misidentification.

<text>Compressed-air-energy storage (CAES) is a way to store energy for later use using compressed air. At a utility scale, energy generated during periods of low demand can be released during peak load periods.

The first utility-scale CAES project was in the Huntorf power plant in Elsfleth, Germany, and is still operational . The Huntorf plant was initially developed as a load balancer for fossil-fuel-generated electricity, but the global shift towards renewable energy renewed interest in CAES systems, to help highly intermittent energy sources like photovoltaics and wind satisfy fluctuating electricity demands.

One ongoing challenge in large-scale design is the management of thermal energy, since the compression of air leads to an unwanted temperature increase that not only reduces operational efficiency but can also lead to damage. The main difference between various architectures lies in thermal engineering. On the other hand, small-scale systems have long been used for propulsion of mine locomotives. Contrasted with traditional batteries, systems can store energy for longer periods of time and have less upkeep.

== Types ==
Compression of air creates heat; the air is warmer after compression. Expansion removes heat. If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, then the efficiency of the storage improves considerably. There are several ways in which a CAES system can deal with heat. Air storage can be adiabatic, diabatic, isothermal, or near-isothermal.

=== Adiabatic ===
Adiabatic storage continues to store the energy produced by compression and returns it to the air as it is expanded to generate power. This is a subject of an ongoing study, with no utility-scale plants as of 2015. The theoretical efficiency of adiabatic storage approaches 100% with perfect insulation, but in practice, round trip efficiency is expected to be 70%. Heat can be stored in a solid such as concrete or stone, or in a fluid such as hot oil (up to 300 °C) or molten salt solutions (600 °C). Storing the heat in hot water may yield an efficiency around 65%.

Packed beds have been proposed as thermal storage units for adiabatic systems. A study numerically simulated an adiabatic compressed air energy storage system using packed bed thermal energy storage. The efficiency of the simulated system under continuous operation was calculated to be between 70.5% and 71%.

Advancements in adiabatic CAES involve the development of high-efficiency thermal energy storage systems that capture and reuse the heat generated during compression. This innovation has led to system efficiencies exceeding 70%, significantly higher than traditional Diabatic systems.

=== Diabatic ===
Diabatic storage dissipates much of the heat of compression with intercoolers (thus approaching isothermal compression) into the atmosphere as waste, essentially wasting the energy used to perform the work of compression. Upon removal from storage, the temperature of this compressed air is &quot;the one indicator&quot; of the amount of stored energy that remains in this air. Consequently, if the air temperature is too low for the energy recovery process, then the air must be substantially re-heated prior to expansion in the turbine to power a generator. This reheating can be accomplished with a natural-gas-fired burner for utility-grade storage or with a heated metal mass. As recovery is often most needed when renewable sources are quiescent, the fuel must be burned to make up for the &quot;wasted&quot; heat. This degrades the efficiency of the storage-recovery cycle. While this approach is relatively simple, the burning of fuel adds to the cost of the recovered electrical energy and compromises the ecological benefits associated with most renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, this is thus far the only system that has been implemented commercially.

The McIntosh, Alabama, CAES plant requires 2.5 MJ of electricity and 1.2 MJ lower heating value (LHV) of gas for each MJ of energy output, corresponding to an energy recovery efficiency of about 27%. A General Electric 7FA 2x1 combined cycle plant, one of the most efficient natural gas plants in operation, uses 1.85 MJ (LHV) of gas per MJ generated, a 54% thermal efficiency.

To improve the efficiency of Diabatic CAES systems, modern designs incorporate heat recovery units that capture waste heat during compression, thereby reducing energy losses and enhancing overall performance.

===Isothermal===
Isothermal compression and expansion approaches attempt to maintain operating temperature by constant heat exchange to the environment. In a reciprocating compressor, this can be achieved by using a finned piston and low cycle speeds. Current challenges in effective heat exchangers mean that they are only practical for low power levels. The theoretical efficiency of isothermal energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat transfer to the environment. In practice, neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some heat losses are unavoidable, leading to a near-isothermal process. Recent developments in isothermal CAES focus on advanced thermal management techniques and materials that maintain constant air temperatures during compression and expansion, minimizing energy losses and improving system efficiency.

=== Near-isothermal ===
Near-isothermal compression (and expansion) is a process in which a gas is compressed in very close proximity to a large incompressible thermal mass such as a heat-absorbing and -releasing structure (HARS) or a water spray. A HARS is usually made up of a series of parallel fins. As the gas is compressed, the heat of compression is rapidly transferred to the thermal mass, so the gas temperature is stabilized. An external cooling circuit is then used to maintain the temperature of the thermal mass. The isothermal efficiency (Z) is a measure of where the process lies between an adiabatic and isothermal process. If the efficiency is 0%, then it is totally adiabatic; with an efficiency of 100%, it is totally isothermal. Typically with a near-isothermal process, an isothermal efficiency of 90–95% can be expected.

=== Hybrid CAES systems ===
Hybrid Compressed Air Energy Storage (H-CAES) systems integrate renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, with traditional CAES technology. This integration allows for the storage of excess renewable energy generated during periods of low demand, which can be released during peak demand to enhance grid stability and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. For instance, the Apex CAES Plant in Texas combines wind energy with CAES to provide a consistent energy output, addressing the intermittency of renewable energy sources.

=== Other ===
One implementation of isothermal CAES uses high-, medium-, and low-pressure pistons in series. Each stage is followed by an airblast venturi pump that draws ambient air over an air-to-air (or air-to-seawater) heat exchanger between each expansion stage. Early compressed-air torpedo designs used a similar approach, substituting seawater for air. The venturi warms the exhaust of the preceding stage and admits this preheated air to the following stage. This approach was widely adopted in various compressed-air vehicles such as H. K. Porter, Inc.&#x27;s mining locomotives and trams. Here, the heat of compression is effectively stored in the atmosphere (or sea) and returned later on.

== Compressors and expanders ==
Compression can be done with electrically-powered turbo-compressors and expansion with turbo-expanders or air engines driving electrical generators to produce electricity.

== Storage ==
Air storage vessels vary in the thermodynamic conditions of the storage and on the technology used:

# Constant volume storage (solution-mined caverns, above-ground vessels, aquifers, automotive applications, etc.)
# Constant pressure storage (underwater pressure vessels, hybrid pumped hydro / compressed air storage)

=== Constant-volume storage ===
This storage system uses a chamber with specific boundaries to store large amounts of air. This means from a thermodynamic point of view that this system is a constant-volume and variable-pressure system. This causes some operational problems for the compressors and turbines, so the pressure variations have to be kept below a certain limit, as do the stresses induced on the storage vessels.

The storage vessel is often a cavern created by solution mining (salt is dissolved in water for extraction) or by using an abandoned mine; use of porous and permeable rock formations (rocks that have interconnected holes, through which liquid or air can pass), such as those in which reservoirs of natural gas are found, has also been studied.

In some cases, an above-ground pipeline was tested as a storage system, giving some good results. Obviously, the cost of the system is higher, but it can be placed wherever the designer chooses, whereas an underground system needs some particular geologic formations (salt domes, aquifers, depleted gas fields, etc.).

=== Constant-pressure storage ===
In this case, the storage vessel is kept at constant pressure, while the gas is contained in a variable-volume vessel. Many types of storage vessels have been proposed, generally relying on liquid displacement to achieve isobaric operation. In such cases, the storage vessel is positioned hundreds of meters below ground level, and the hydrostatic pressure (head) of the water column above the storage vessel maintains the pressure at the desired level.

This configuration allows:
* Improvement of the energy density of the storage system because all the air contained can be used (the pressure is constant in all charge conditions, full or empty, so the turbine has no problem exploiting it, while with constant-volume systems, if the pressure goes below a safety limit, then the system needs to stop).
* Removal of the requirement of throttling prior to the expansion.
* Avoidance of mixing of heat at different temperatures in the Thermal Energy Storage system, which leads to irreversibility.
* Improvement of the efficiency of the turbomachinery, which will work under constant-inlet conditions.
* Use of various geographic locations for the positioning of the CAES plant (coastal lines, floating platforms, etc.).
On the other hand, the cost of this storage system is higher due to the need to position the storage vessel on the bottom of the chosen water reservoir (often the ocean) and due to the cost of the vessel itself.

A different approach consists of burying a large bag buried under several meters of sand instead of water.

Plants operate on a peak-shaving daily cycle, charging at night and discharging during the day. Heating the compressed air using natural gas or geothermal heat to increase the amount of energy being extracted has been studied by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Compressed-air energy storage can also be employed on a smaller scale, such as exploited by air cars and air-driven locomotives, and can use high-strength (e.g., carbon-fiber) air-storage tanks. In order to retain the energy stored in compressed air, this tank should be thermally isolated from the environment; otherwise, the energy stored will escape in the form of heat, because compressing air raises its temperature.

== Environmental Impact ==
CAES systems are often considered an environmentally friendly alternative to other large-scale energy storage technologies due to their reliance on naturally occurring resources, such as salt caverns for air storage and ambient air as the working medium. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, which require the extraction of finite resources such as lithium and cobalt, CAES has a minimal environmental footprint during its lifecycle.

However, the construction of CAES facilities presents unique challenges. Underground air storage requires geological formations such as salt domes, which are geographically limited. Inappropriate siting or mismanagement during construction can lead to disruptions in local ecosystems, land subsidence, or groundwater contamination.

On the positive side, CAES systems integrated with renewable energy sources contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by enabling the storage and dispatch of clean energy during peak demand. Additionally, repurposing depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations for air storage can mitigate environmental impacts and extend the usefulness of existing infrastructure.

=== Economic Considerations ===
The cost of implementing CAES systems depends heavily on the geological conditions of the site, the scale of the facility, and the type of CAES process used (adiabatic, diabatic, or isothermal). Initial capital expenditures are significant, often ranging from $500 to $1,200 per kW for large-scale systems. These costs primarily include the development of underground storage caverns, compression and expansion equipment, and thermal energy storage units (for advanced systems).

Despite the high upfront costs, CAES facilities have long operational lifespans, often exceeding 30 years, with low maintenance and operational costs compared to lithium-ion battery storage systems, which require periodic replacements. This long-term cost efficiency makes CAES particularly attractive for electric utility companies and grid operators.

=== Policy and Regulation ===
Market trends suggest growing interest in CAES technology due to increasing renewable energy integration and the need for grid-scale energy storage. Government incentives and declining costs of advanced components, such as high-efficiency compressors and turbines, are further enhancing the economic feasibility of CAES.

Government policies and regulatory frameworks are critical in determining the pace of CAES adoption and development. Countries like Germany and the United States have implemented various incentives, including tax credits and grants, to promote energy storage technologies. For instance, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Storage Grand Challengeincludes CAES as a key focus area for research and development funding.

One of the significant regulatory hurdles for CAES is the permitting process for underground air storage facilities. Environmental impact assessments, land use approvals, and safety standards for high-pressure storage systems can delay or increase costs for CAES projects. For example, projects sited near urban areas often face additional scrutiny due to concerns about noise pollution, air quality, and potential risks associated with high-pressure air storage.

Internationally, efforts are underway to standardize the design, operation, and safety protocols for CAES systems. Organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and regional bodies such as the European Union have been instrumental in developing frameworks to support the integration of CAES into modern energy grids. As renewable energy adoption accelerates, policies aimed at addressing intermittency challenges will likely prioritize grid-scale solutions like CAES.

== History ==
Citywide compressed air energy systems for delivering mechanical power directly via compressed air have been built since 1870. Cities such as Paris, France; Birmingham, England; Dresden, Rixdorf, and Offenbach, Germany; and Buenos Aires, Argentina, installed such systems. Victor Popp constructed the first systems to power clocks by sending a pulse of air every minute to change their pointer arms. They quickly evolved to deliver power to homes and industries. As of 1896, the Paris system had 2.2 MW of generation distributed at 550 kPa in 50 km of air pipes for motors in light and heavy industry. Usage was measured in cubic meters. The systems were the main source of house-delivered energy in those days and also powered the machines of dentists, seamstresses, printing facilities, and bakeries.

The first utility-scale diabatic compressed-air energy storage project was the 290-megawatt Huntorf plant opened in 1978 in Germany using a salt dome cavern with a capacity of and a 42% efficiency.

A plant that could store up to (and produce up to for 26 hours) was built in McIntosh, Alabama in 1991. The Alabama facility&#x27;s $65 million cost equals $590 per kW of power capacity and about $23 per kW⋅h of storage capacity. It uses a solution-mined salt cavern to store air at up to . Although the compression phase is approximately 82% efficient, the expansion phase requires the combustion of natural gas at one-third the rate of a gas turbine producing the same amount of electricity at 54% efficiency.

In 2012, General Compression completed construction of a two-megawatt near-isothermal project in Gaines County, Texas, the world&#x27;s third such project. The project uses no fuel. It appears to have stopped operating in 2016.

A 60MW, 300MW⋅h facility with 60% efficiency opened in Jiangsu, China, using a salt cavern (2022).

A 2.5MW, 4MW⋅h compressed closed-cycle facility started operating in Sardinia, Italy (2022).

In 2022, Zhangjiakou connected the world&#x27;s first 100MW storage system to the grid in north China. It uses supercritical thermal storage, supercritical heat exchange, and high-load compression and expansion technologies. The plant can store 400MW⋅h with 70.4% efficiency. Construction of a 350MW, 1.4GW⋅h salt cave project started in Shangdong at a cost of $208 million, operating in 2024 with 64% efficiency, and construction of a four-hour, 700MW, 2.8GW⋅h facility started in China in 2024.

== Largest CAES facilities ==


== Projects ==
In 2009, the US Department of Energy awarded $24.9 million in matching funds for phase one of a 300MW, $356 million Pacific Gas and Electric Company installation using a saline porous rock formation being developed near Bakersfield in Kern County, California. The goals of the project were to build and validate an advanced design.

In 2010, the US Department of Energy provided $29.4 million in funding to conduct preliminary work on a 150-MW salt-based project being developed by Iberdrola USA in Watkins Glen, New York. The goal is to incorporate smart grid technology to balance renewable intermittent energy sources.

The first adiabatic project, a 200-megawatt facility called ADELE, was planned for construction in Germany (2013) with a target of 70% efficiency by using air at 100 bars of pressure. This project was delayed for undisclosed reasons until at least 2016.

Storelectric Ltd planned to build a 40-MW 100% renewable energy pilot plant in Cheshire, UK, with 800 MWh of storage capacity (2017).

Hydrostor completed the first commercial A-CAES system in Goderich, Ontario, supplying service with 2.2MW / 10MWh storage to the Ontario Grid (2019). It was the first A-CAES system to achieve commercial operation in decades.

The European-Union-funded RICAS (adiabatic) project in Austria was to use crushed rock to store heat from the compression process to improve efficiency (2020). The system was expected to achieve 70–80% efficiency.

Apex planned a plant for Anderson County, Texas, to go online in 2016. This project has been delayed until at least 2020.

Canadian company Hydrostor planned to build four Advance plants in Toronto, Goderich, Angas, and Rosamond (2020). Some included partial heat storage in water, improving efficiency to 65%.

As of 2022, the Gem project at Rosamond in Kern County, California, was planned to provide 500 MW / 4,000 MWh of storage. The Pecho project in San Luis Obispo, California, was planned to be 400 MW / 3,200 MWh. The Broken Hill project in New South Wales, Australia was 200 MW / 1,600 MWh.

In 2023, Alliant Energy announced plans to construct a 200-MWh compressed facility based on the Sardinia facility in Columbia County, Wisconsin. It will be the first of its kind in the United States.

Compressed air energy storage may be stored in undersea caves in Northern Ireland.

== Storage thermodynamics ==

In order to achieve a near-thermodynamically-reversible process so that most of the energy is saved in the system and can be retrieved, and losses are kept negligible, a near-reversible isothermal process or an isentropic process is desired.

=== Isothermal storage ===
In an isothermal compression process, the gas in the system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires an exchange of heat with the gas; otherwise, the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange can be achieved by heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator, and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimized for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate isothermal compression even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.

When one obtains perfect isothermal storage (and discharge), the process is said to be &quot;reversible&quot;. This requires that the heat transfer between the surroundings and the gas occur over an infinitesimally small temperature difference. In that case, there is no exergy loss in the heat transfer process, and so the compression work can be completely recovered as expansion work: 100% storage efficiency. However, in practice, there is always a temperature difference in any heat transfer process, and so all practical energy storage obtains efficiencies lower than 100%.

To estimate the compression/expansion work in an isothermal process, it may be assumed that the compressed air obeys the ideal gas law:
: formula_1
For a process from an initial state &quot;A&quot; to a final state &quot;B&quot;, with absolute temperature formula_2 constant, one finds the work required for compression (negative) or done by the expansion (positive) to be
: formula_3

where formula_4, and so formula_5.

Here formula_6 is the absolute pressure, formula_7 is the (unknown) volume of gas compressed, formula_8 is the volume of the vessel, formula_9 is the amount of substance of gas (mol), and formula_10 is the ideal gas constant.

If there is a constant pressure outside of the vessel, which is equal to the starting pressure formula_11, the positive work of the outer pressure reduces the exploitable energy (negative value). This adds a term to the equation above:
: formula_12
; Example

How much energy can be stored in a 1 m3 storage vessel at a pressure of , if the ambient pressure is ? In this case, the process work is

: formula_13 = 
: = 7.0 MPa × 1 m3 × ln(0.1 MPa/7.0 MPa) + (7.0 MPa − 0.1 MPa) × 1 m3 = −22.8 MJ.

The negative sign means that work is done on the gas by the surroundings. Process irreversibilities (such as in heat transfer) will result in less energy being recovered from the expansion process than is required for the compression process. If the environment is at a constant temperature, for example, then the thermal resistance in the intercoolers will mean that the compression occurs at a temperature somewhat higher than the ambient temperature, and the expansion will occur at a temperature somewhat lower than the ambient temperature. So a perfect isothermal storage system is impossible to achieve.

=== Adiabatic (isentropic) storage ===
An adiabatic process is one where there is no heat transfer between the fluid and the surroundings: the system is insulated against heat transfer. If the process is furthermore internally reversible (frictionless, to the ideal limit), then it will additionally be isentropic.

An adiabatic storage system does away with the intercooling during the compression process and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression and likewise cool down during expansion. This is attractive since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but the downside is that the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%. The result is that round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.

=== Large storage system thermodynamics ===
Energy storage systems often use large caverns. This is the preferred system design due to the very large volume and thus the large quantity of energy that can be stored with only a small pressure change. The gas is compressed adiabatically with little temperature change (approaching a reversible isothermal system) and heat loss (approaching an isentropic system). This advantage is in addition to the low cost of constructing the gas storage system, using the underground walls to assist in containing the pressure. The cavern space can be insulated to improve efficiency.

Undersea insulated airbags that have similar thermodynamic properties to large cavern storage have been suggested.

== Vehicle applications ==
=== Practical constraints in transportation ===
In order to use air storage in vehicles or aircraft for practical land or air transportation, the energy storage system must be compact and lightweight. Energy density and specific energy are the engineering terms that define these desired qualities.

==== Specific energy, energy density, and efficiency ====
As explained in the thermodynamics of the gas storage section above, compressing air heats it, and expansion cools it. Therefore, practical air engines require heat exchangers in order to avoid excessively high or low temperatures, and even so do not reach ideal constant-temperature conditions or ideal thermal insulation.

Nevertheless, as stated above, it is useful to describe the maximum energy storable using the isothermal case, which works out to about 100 kJ/m3 [ ln(&quot;P&quot;&quot;A&quot;/&quot;P&quot;&quot;B&quot;)].

Thus if 1.0 m3 of air from the atmosphere is very slowly compressed into a 5 L bottle at , then the potential energy stored is 530 kJ. A highly efficient air motor can transfer this into kinetic energy if it runs very slowly and manages to expand the air from its initial 20 MPa pressure down to 100 kPa (bottle completely &quot;empty&quot; at atmospheric pressure). Achieving high efficiency is a technical challenge both due to heat loss to the ambient and to unrecoverable internal gas heat. If the bottle above is emptied to 1 MPa, then the extractable energy is about 300 kJ at the motor shaft.

A standard 20-MPa, 5-L steel bottle has a mass of 7.5 kg, and a superior one 5 kg. High-tensile-strength fibers such as carbon fiber or Kevlar can weigh below 2 kg in this size, consistent with the legal safety codes. One cubic meter of air at 20 °C has a mass of 1.204 kg at standard temperature and pressure. Thus, &quot;theoretical&quot; specific energies are from roughly 70 kJ/kg at the motor shaft for a plain steel bottle to 180 kJ/kg for an advanced fiber-wound one, whereas practical &quot;achievable&quot; specific energies for the same containers would be from 40 to 100 kJ/kg.

==== Safety ====
As with most technologies, compressed air has safety concerns, mainly catastrophic tank rupture. Safety regulations make this a rare occurrence at the cost of higher weight and additional safety features such as pressure relief valves. Regulations may limit the legal working pressure to less than 40% of the rupture pressure for steel bottles (for a safety factor of 2.5) and less than 20% for fiber-wound bottles (safety factor 5). Commercial designs adopt the ISO 11439 standard. High-pressure bottles are fairly strong so that they generally do not rupture in vehicle crashes.

=== Comparison with batteries ===
Advanced fiber-reinforced bottles are comparable to the rechargeable lead–acid battery in terms of energy density. Batteries provide nearly-constant voltage over their entire charge level, whereas the pressure varies greatly while using a pressure vessel from full to empty. It is technically challenging to design air engines to maintain high efficiency and sufficient power over a wide range of pressures. Compressed air can transfer power at very high flux rates, which meets the principal acceleration and deceleration objectives of transportation systems, particularly for hybrid vehicles.

Compressed air systems have advantages over conventional batteries, including longer lifetimes of pressure vessels and lower material toxicity. Newer battery designs such as those based on lithium iron phosphate chemistry suffer from neither of these problems. Compressed air costs are potentially lower; however, advanced pressure vessels are costly to develop and safety-test and at present are more expensive than mass-produced batteries.

As with electric storage technology, compressed air is only as &quot;clean&quot; as the source of the energy that it stores. Life cycle assessment addresses the question of overall emissions from a given energy storage technology combined with a given mix of generation on a power grid.

=== Engine ===
A pneumatic motor or compressed-air engine uses the expansion of compressed air to drive the pistons of an engine, turn the axle, or to drive a turbine.

The following methods can increase efficiency:
* A continuous expansion turbine at high efficiency
* Multiple expansion stages
* Use of waste heat, notably in a hybrid heat engine design
* Use of environmental heat

A highly efficient arrangement uses high, medium, and low pressure pistons in series, with each stage followed by an airblast venturi that draws ambient air over an air-to-air heat exchanger. This warms the exhaust of the preceding stage and admits this preheated air to the following stage. The only exhaust gas from each stage is cold air, which can be as cold as ; the cold air may be used for air conditioning in a car.

Additional heat can be supplied by burning fuel, as in 1904 for the Whitehead torpedo. This improves the range and speed available for a given tank volume at the cost of the additional fuel.

==== Cars ====
Since about 1990, several companies have claimed to be developing compressed-air cars, but none is available. Typically, the main claimed advantages are no roadside pollution, low cost, use of cooking oil for lubrication, and integrated air conditioning.

The time required to refill a depleted tank is important for vehicle applications. &quot;Volume transfer&quot; moves pre-compressed air from a stationary tank to the vehicle tank almost instantaneously. Alternatively, a stationary or on-board compressor can compress air on demand, possibly requiring several hours.

==== Ships ====
Large marine diesel engines have started using compressed air, typically stored in large bottles between 20 and 30 bar, acting directly on the pistons via special starting valves to turn the crankshaft prior to beginning fuel injection. This arrangement is more compact and cheaper than an electric starter motor would be at such scales and able to supply the necessary burst of extremely high power without placing a prohibitive load on the ship&#x27;s electrical generators and distribution system. Compressed air is commonly also used, at lower pressures, to control the engine and act as the spring force acting on the cylinder exhaust valves, and to operate other auxiliary systems and power tools on board, sometimes including pneumatic PID controllers. One advantage of this approach is that, in the event of an electrical blackout, ship systems powered by stored compressed air can continue functioning uninterrupted, and generators can be restarted without an electrical supply. Another is that pneumatic tools can be used in commonly-wet environments without the risk of electric shock.

==== Hybrid vehicles ====
While the air storage system offers a relatively low power density and vehicle range, its high efficiency is attractive for hybrid vehicles that use a conventional internal combustion engine as the main power source. The air storage can be used for regenerative braking and to optimize the cycle of the piston engine, which is not equally efficient at all power/RPM levels.

Bosch and PSA Peugeot Citroën have developed a hybrid system that uses hydraulics as a way to transfer energy to and from a compressed nitrogen tank. An up-to-45% reduction in fuel consumption is claimed, corresponding to 2.9 L / 100 km (81 mpg, 69 g /km) on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) for a compact frame like Peugeot 208. The system is claimed to be much more affordable than competing electric and flywheel KERS systems and is expected on road cars by 2016.

=== History of air engines ===

Air engines have been used since the 19th century to power mine locomotives, pumps, drills, and trams, via centralized, city-level distribution. Racecars use compressed air to start their internal combustion engine (ICE), and large diesel engines may have starting pneumatic motors.

== Types of systems ==
=== Hybrid systems ===
Brayton cycle engines compress and heat air with a fuel suitable for an internal combustion engine. For example, burning natural gas or biogas heats compressed air, and then a conventional gas turbine engine or the rear portion of a jet engine expands it to produce work.

Compressed air engines can recharge an electric battery. The apparently-defunct Energine promoted its Pne-PHEV or Pneumatic Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle-system.

==== Existing hybrid systems ====
Huntorf, Germany in 1978, and McIntosh, Alabama, U.S. in 1991 commissioned hybrid power plants.&lt;ref name=&#x27;new.scientist.com/vol.195 no.2623 p. 45&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both systems use off-peak energy for air compression and burn natural gas in the compressed air during the power-generating phase.

==== Future hybrid systems ====
The Iowa Stored Energy Park (ISEP) would have used aquifer storage rather than cavern storage. The ISEP was an innovative, 270-megawatt, $400 million compressed air energy storage (CAES) project proposed for in-service near Des Moines, Iowa, in 2015. The project was terminated after eight years in development because of site geological limitation, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Additional facilities are under development in Norton, Ohio. FirstEnergy, an Akron, Ohio, electric utility, obtained development rights to the 2,700-MW Norton project in November 2009.

The RICAS2020 project attempts to use an abandoned mine for adiabatic CAES with heat recovery. The compression heat is stored in a tunnel section filled with loose stones, so the compressed air is nearly cool when entering the main pressure storage chamber. The cool compressed air regains the heat stored in the stones when released back through a surface turbine, leading to higher overall efficiency. A two-stage process has theoretical higher efficiency of around 70%.

=== Underwater storage ===

==== Bag/tank ====
Deep water in lakes and the ocean can provide pressure without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags. Obstacles include the limited number of suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Given the low cost of the containers, great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of such systems is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds.

==== Hydroelectric ====
A nearly isobaric solution is possible by using the compressed gas to drive a hydroelectric system. This solution requires large pressure tanks on land (as well as underwater airbags). Hydrogen gas is the preferred fluid, since other gases suffer from substantial hydrostatic pressures at even relatively modest depths (~500 meters).

European electrical utility company E.ON has provided €1.4 million (£1.1 million) in funding to develop undersea air storage bags. Hydrostor in Canada is developing a commercial system of underwater storage &quot;accumulators&quot; for compressed air energy storage, starting at the 1- to 4-MW scale.

==== Buoy ====
When excess wind energy is available from offshore wind turbines, a spool-tethered buoy can be pushed below the surface. When electricity demand rises, the buoy is allowed to rise towards the surface, generating power.

=== Nearly isothermal compression ===

A number of methods of nearly isothermal compression are being developed. Fluid Mechanics has a system with a heat absorbing and releasing structure (HARS) attached to a reciprocating piston. Light Sail injects a water spray into a reciprocating cylinder. SustainX uses an air-water foam mix inside a semi-custom, 120-rpm compressor/expander. All these systems ensure that the air is compressed with high thermal diffusivity compared to the speed of compression. Typically these compressors can run at speeds up to 1000 rpm. To ensure high thermal diffusivity, the average distance a gas molecule is from a heat-absorbing surface is about 0.5 mm. These nearly-isothermal compressors can also be used as nearly-isothermal expanders and are being developed to improve the round-trip efficiency of CAES.

<doc id="436424" wikidata="Q2578278" url="?curid=436424" title="Visual poetry">
<text>Visual poetry is a style of poetry that incorporates graphic and visual design elements to convey its meaning. This style combines visual art and written expression to create new ways of presenting and interpreting poetry.

Visual poetry focuses on playing with form, which means it often takes on various art styles. These styles can range from altering the structure of the words on the page to adding other kinds of media to change the poem itself.

Some forms of visual poetry may retain their narrative structure, but this is not a requirement of visual poetry. Some visual poets create more abstract works that steer away from linguistic meaning and instead focus heavily on the composition of words and letters to create a visually pleasing piece.

==Differentiation from concrete poetry==
Literary theorists have identified visual poetry as a development of concrete poetry but with the characteristics of intermedia in which non-representational language and visual elements predominate.

As the literary and artistic experiments of the 1950s that were at first loosely grouped together as concrete poetry extended further into the ambiguous sphere which Dick Higgins described in 1965 as &#x27;Intermedia&#x27;, it became apparent that such creations were further and further divorced from the representational language with which poetry had hitherto been associated and that they needed to be categorized as a separate phenomenon.

In her survey, &quot;Concrete Poetry: A World View&quot; (1968), Mary Ellen Solt observed that certain trends included under the label &quot;concrete poetry&quot; were tending towards a &quot;new visual poetry&quot;. Its chief characteristic is that it leaves behind the old poetic function of orality and is therefore distinct from the ancient tradition of shaped poetry from which concrete poetry claimed to have derived. Visual poetry, on the other hand, is to be distinguished by its deployment of typography.
Solt included in her proposed new genre the work of Ian Hamilton Finlay, John Furnival and Hansjörg Mayer. Her definition was extended by Marvin A. Sackner in his introduction to the Ohio State University 2008 collection of visual poetry: &quot;I define concrete poems as those in which only letters and/or words are utilized to form a visual image, whereas visual poems constitute those in which images are integrated into the text of the poem&quot;. He also separated out artist-generated picture poems and artists&#x27; books as an allied category, citing the work of Kenneth Patchen. Also to be found in the university collection is Tom Phillips&#x27; &quot;A Humument&quot;, as well as an assortment of handwritten but non-linguistic texts.

In the light of these assertions, a new genealogy of forerunners to visual poetry emerges that includes Joan Miró&#x27;s poem-painting &quot;Le corps de ma brune&quot; (1925), Piet Mondrian&#x27;s incorporation of Michel Seuphor&#x27;s text in &quot;Textuel&quot; (1928), and prints (&#x27;) by H.N. Werkman using elements of typography. The last also used the typewriter to create abstract patterns (which he called &#x27;), using not just letters but also purely linear elements. Created during the 1920s, they anticipated the intermediary &#x27;typestracts&#x27; of the concrete poet Dom Sylvester Houédard during the 1960s that would equally qualify as visual poetry.

Klaus Peter Dencker also stresses the continuity of the new genre in his theoretical paper &quot;From Concrete to Visual Poetry&quot; (2000), pointing out its &quot;intermedial and interdisciplinary&quot; nature. The two are also interdependent and &quot;without concrete poetry the current forms of visual poetry would be unthinkable&quot;. The academic Willard Bohn, however, prefers to categorize the whole gamut of literary and artistic experiment in this area since the late 19th century under the label of &quot;visual poetry&quot; and has done so in a number of books since 1986. From his reductionist point of view, &quot;Visual poetry can be defined as poetry that is meant to be seen – poetry that presupposes a viewer as well as a reader&quot;.

<text>Godfrey is a small community located about 40 minutes&#x27; drive time north of Kingston, Ontario, Canada on Hwy. 38. It is named for Chester H. Godfrey, one of the original settlers, who donated land on which the village was built. While there is currently no specific village, it can be described as the area of Highway 38 that extends between the villages of Verona and Parham, as well as that portion of Westport Road extending to the hamlet of Burridge. It also includes the former settlement of Cole Lake. (which possessed a separate rail station, known as Hinchinbrooke Station, and postal outlet up to the early part of the 20th century). Godfrey was originally in the Township of Hinchinbrooke which has since become amalgamated into the township of Central Frontenac, which also encompasses the townships of Kennebec, Olden and Oso.

==History==

The place currently known as Godfrey was founded as &quot;Deniston&quot; on 10 October 1854, based on the placement of a post office by the same name. Locals referred to the place as &quot;Iron Ore Junction&quot;, due to the large ore deposits and other mineral deposits in the area. The presence of iron ore was known since 1869 when it was reported in the provincial gazetteer that &quot;Iron and plumbago are in the neighbourhood.&quot; The place was renamed to Godfrey on 1 April 1878 named in honor of Chester H. Godfrey, the man who had donated land which the village is built and due to his position as Justice of the Peace of Deniston. References to a place name of &quot;Bedford Station&quot; can also be found, as the rail station on the Kingston and Pembroke line in Godfrey, was known as &quot;Bedford Station&quot;.

Chester Godfrey inherited the land on the 3rd Concession in Hinchinbrooke Township that became the town, Godfrey, bearing his namesake. He inherited this land from his father, Warren Godfrey when his father moved on to Olden Township. Warren Godfrey applied for land patent for the land in December 1843 to the Governor General of British North America, Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe. The land patent was granted on 21 March 1844. Warren Godfrey Land Patent Warren Godfrey was also the construction supervisor of 41 miles of the Frontenac Road in Hinchenbrooke Township, northward through Olden and Clarendon Townships to the intersection of the Mississippi Road.

First settlers to the area were John McKnight, James Hickey, Michael Judge, James Hill, Terry Nefcey and James Kennedy. First babies born to the new settlers were James Hickey and Ned Judge in 1837; born the same day only minutes apart.

Godfrey became home to two general stores , McGowan&#x27;s and R.B. Howes and Son General Store which was also an Esso dealer. R.B. Howes and Son was founded in 1885 by Richard Bennett Howes who also took the post master position for Godfrey. Richard Howes was joined in business by his son, Joe Howes, in 1924 and the General Store became known as &quot;R.B. Howes and Son&quot;. When Richard died, Joe assumed ownership of the store and took the position of postmaster. He was postmaster until retirement in 1960 when the position was transferred to Richard Leslie Judge. Joe Howes however, continued to run the store and eventually transferred the business to his son, Richard (Dick) Howes. The store closed in 1981; the end of the era of the General Store.

==Kingston and Pembroke Railway (K&amp;P)==
The Kingston and Pembroke Railway established the Bedford Station in Godfrey, opening in 1875. As many as eight trains would come into the station daily.

==Mining==
As mentioned above, ore deposits were known to the residents of Godfrey for some time before the K&amp;P railway opened up the area to larger scale mining. K&amp;P ran a branch line to a mine known as the Glendower mine, four miles from the Bedford station.

===Iron ore===
Starting 1873, the Glendower Company was formed and mined the Glendower Mine for iron ore for approximately seven years. In that timeframe, 12,000 tons of iron ore were extracted, hauled to Bedford Station either by wagon or sleigh and shipped to Elmira, New York. After the seven years, the Glendower Company surrendered their lease on the land. In 1882, a company of American capitalists was formed under the name of the &quot;Zanesville Company&quot; which eventually merged with the Kingston and Pembroke company in approximately 1887. During the operation by the Zanesville Company, they constructed the K&amp;P spur line from Bedford to the mine and the mine operated productively for another four to five years. The Zanesville mine operators found sulphur mixed with the ore at a depth of 180 feet and ceased mine operations until they were able to use drills that enabled them to mine to a depth of 300–400 feet and low sulphur content (one to three percent) ore was again discovered. However, by 1895, the mine was no longer in operation.

Other mines in the area were the Howse Mine, and Black Lake Mine.

===Feldspar===
In 1901, Feldspar was also found in abundance near Godfrey. It was mined and shipped to the United States via the Bedford K&amp;P Station. The feldspar was mined at the Richardson Feldspar Mine which ultimately became the largest producer of feldspar in Canada: producing 228,690 tons of feldspar between 1901 and 1951. The mine, located in concession II, lot 1, is found between Thirteen Island Lake and Desert Lake. In the 1880s, mining rights were acquired by the Kingston Feldspar Mining Company, part of what is now James Richardson &amp; Sons, Limited. Mining did not start in earnest until the early 1900s. The mine was also known as the Desert Lake or Hoppins Property, as Richardson leased the land from owner, A. Hoppins. Output from the mine varied between 200 tons &quot;per day&quot; in 1902 and 130 tons per day in 1906, and represented, at the time, the largest feldspar producing mine in the province. This was evidently made possible by the accessibility of ore in the mine, as reported in 1903, &quot;feldspar covers the floor of this whole mine-area, practically all of it clean and pure&quot;. The feldspar mined at this site was analyzed By the Ontario Bureau of Mines in 1905 to have the following composition: silica 66.23%, alumina 18.77%, potash 12.09% and soda 3.11%. Descriptively, it was reported to be &quot;rich, light-red [in] colour, remarkably well formed, with well developed cleavage, lustrous, translucent and pronounced to be microline&quot;.

To transport the feldspar to market, the workmen hoisted the feldspar ore to the top of a hill in two-ton buckets which were transported by inclined tramway to Thirteen Island Lake. The ore was then tugged across the Thirteen Island Lake, transferred and tugged across Thirty Island Lake. From there, it was taken to the rail spur line at the Glendower mine and to the Bedford Station of the K&amp;P. The ore was then moved to Kingston and across Lake Ontario to the United States.

From 1916 to 1918, the mine was owned and operated by Feldspar Ltd. of Toronto. The mine remained idle until 1928 when it was leased to the Genesse Feldspar Company of Rochester, New York, and operated until 1931. Leased again in 1941 to E.H. Storms and S.A. Price of Toronto under the name Federal Feldspar Company, the mine produced 414 tons of feldspar. In 1945, the Canadian Flint and Spar Company of Ottawa purchased the mine and operated until 1951. Recent mine mapping operations indicate that the mine could contain 80,000 tons of quartz.

===Mica===
Mica was another mineral mined in quantity in the Godfrey area. The mica was recorded as having been mined on the property of Chester Godfrey, with eight prospect pits, averaging 14 feet in depth and providing a 60-ton output in 1891. The mica itself was described as superior light amber; very hard and flexible. In 1891, the Bureau of Mines reported that the main vein in the &quot;Godfrey Mine&quot;had not yet been discovered which indicated more mica could be mined.

Of the mica mined in Ontario, 90-95% of it was used in the electric industry. This was true until the depression of 1907 stalled the electric trades which caused a drop in the mica mining trades in the province. Those supporting the mica industry were directly affected; for example, mica producers dropped in Ottawa from 1,500 persons to less than 100.

Mica was not mined again in Godfrey until about 1940 in some small quantity. The Godfrey mine is now classified as &quot;past producing without reserves&quot;.

==Hill&#x27;s School and public education history in the area==
In 1840, a one-room log school house was opened to teach the children in new community of Deniston. The log school was replaced by another school in 1901. . In 1940, the &quot;Hill School&quot;, as the locals called it, was documented by the Province of Ontario as the &quot;Hinchinbrooke School&quot;. On average, 26 students were taught by Mrs. Mamie Hill who earned a $700 annual salary. The Provincial report indicated that the type of school building was &quot;F&quot; which is referenced on page 3 of the report to be a &quot;frame&quot; building.

When originally built, Hill School, would have been part of the school system in Hinchinbrooke, in the County of Frontenac. The residents of Hinchinbrooke had been trying throughout the mid-1800s to improve their educational potential given their meager resources, as evidenced in 1860, when superintendent of schools, Thomas R. Dupuis, esq, commented in his annual report: &quot;This is a back Township, and very poor, and the schools are proportionally small and badly provided with teachers and means of teaching. However, there is a marked increase in attendance, and an improvement in the state of schools. From the interest taken in school matters, and the energy displayed by the officers of the section, it promises to become one of the most flourishing sections of the township. &quot; The issue of free education was not missed on the residents of this &quot;back Township&quot;, whereby as early as 1858, three-quarters of the schools in Hinchinbrooke were free. The others required 25 cents per pupil per month but tuition from the pupil was rarely collected in full measure. Only 1850, with the passage of the Common School Acts, did free education become dictated by law by allowing property taxes to be collected for the purposes of providing education to all pupils. The groundwork for this legislation was laid by Egerton Ryerson in his &quot;Circular to the County Municipalities&quot;, in 1846.

==Present day==
Godfrey is a part of South Frontenac and Central Frontenac Townships as of the 1998 amalgamation of the Townships of Hinchinbrooke, Kennebec, Olden and Oso.

Local Postal Code is K0H 1T0 and the Godfrey Canada Post location is 8109 County Road 38.

<text>Le Père Duchesne (; &quot;Old Man Duchesne&quot; or &quot;Father Duchesne&quot;) was an extreme radical newspaper during the French Revolution, edited by Jacques Hébert, who published 385 issues from September 1790 until eleven days before his death by guillotine, which took place on March 24, 1794.

==History==

To be denounced as an enemy of the Republic by &quot;Le père Duchesne&quot; often led to the guillotine. The journal frequently used euphemistic language to call for the trial and execution of perceived enemies, such as calling for the &quot;carriage with thirty-six doors&quot; to take a &quot;toad of the Marais&quot; to &quot;sneeze in the bag&quot;, &quot;ask the time from the fanlight&quot;, or &quot;try on Capet&#x27;s necktie&quot;.

The anti-feminist views of the publication have been noted by numerous scholarly works. Women&#x27;s political agency was maligned as a threat to society. Perverse imagery about women&#x27;s bodies caricatured the threat posed by women&#x27;s political power, for example, by incendiary accusations that blood flowed from the &quot;miraculous teats&quot; instead of breast milk.

Born in the fairs of the 18th century, Père Duchesne was a character representing the man of the people, always moved to denounce abuses and injustices. This imaginary character is found in a text entitled &quot;le plat de Carnaval&quot; (&quot;the Carnival dish&quot;), as well as an anonymous minor work in February 1789 called &quot;Journey of Père Duchesne to Versailles&quot; or &quot;Père Duchesne&#x27;s Anger at the Prospect of Abuses&quot; in the same year.

In 1789, several pamphlets had been published under this name. In 1790, an employee of the post office by the name of Antoine Lemaire and &quot;Abbé&quot; Jean-Charles Jumel had been attacked in newspapers resorting to the fictional pseudonym &quot;Père Duchesne,&quot; but the &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; of Hébert, sold by the street-criers yelling &quot;Père Duchesne is damn angry today!&quot;, was distinguished by the violence which characterized his style.

From 1790 to 1791, &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; represented the Jacobin Club, and eulogized King Louis XVI and the Marquis de La Fayette for their attempts to balance out the power of aristocrats and the people of France. After the king&#x27;s attempted flight to Varennes the writers changed their views of Louis and blamed Marie Antoinette and Jean-Sifrein Maury, the great defender of papal authority against the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. In 1792, the government printed certain issues of &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; at the expense of the Republic, in order to distribute them to the army to rouse soldiers from a torpor considered dangerous to public safety.

The tone towards Louis changed drastically after his failed attempts to make changes to benefit the common people of France. La Fayette was also attacked after the &quot;Champ de Mars massacre.&quot; Marie Antoinette was criticized because she was partially seen as a reason for Louis&#x27;s downfall. Her nationality was blamed because she was seen as an outsider who didn&#x27;t deserve the king. The issues of children also brought trouble because it was believed that she was the reason for the infertility and this put a strain on Louis.

The paper continued to run until Hébert&#x27;s death in 1794.

== Focuses ==
It said that the country was ruled by the rich, but &quot;nineteen-twentieths are neither rich nor merchants,&quot; but &quot;this mass was always pure.&quot; The paper criticized the government&#x27;s lack of actions in stopping counterrevolution and the &quot;dictatorial actions&quot; used to rule the country. It would often focus on specific people and events and completely degrade every single part of it. Hébert was a radical, never slow to express his opinion, and used profane language in the majority of his published pieces. The paper was used to fight off and call out other parties that contradicted the author&#x27;s views, such as the Girondists.

The editor had followers who called themselves Hébertists. Hébertists shared the idea of the dechristianization of France, which was a recurring topic in the paper.

In some cases, the paper would criticize the people whom it was trying to defend, the sans-culottes. It spoke of their &quot;gullibility&quot; when it came to the words of the government. It stated that they were a &quot;sheep-like species&quot; who &quot;cannot see farther than their noses.&quot; The people were making it more difficult on themselves by believing what the government was telling them.

== Camille Desmoulins ==
One of the main enemies of the paper was journalist Camille Desmoulins. Desmoulins was against the movement to dechristianize France, which Hébert and his followers supported. Père Duchesne and Desmoulins would often bicker back-and-forth within their respective papers. Desmoulins was executed a few weeks after Hébert.

== End and revival of &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; ==
As soon as Hébert was guillotined, these counterfeit &quot;Père Duchesnes&quot; had a field day, producing parodies such as &quot;The great anger of Père Duchesne seeing his head fall from the national window&quot;. Others, such as Saint-Venant, would try, with &quot;Moustache without fear&quot;, to write new parodies in the spirit of the time and in the same lewd gutter style that characterized Hébert. Lebon published one of them in 1797, and Damane published 32 issues under the name &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; in Lyon. The title was reprised numerous times in the 19th century.

The title was used again hundreds of times afterwards, mainly during revolutionary periods, for publications with no direct connection to the original: for example, during the July Revolution of 1830, the Revolution of 1848, and during the Paris Commune (1871).

<doc id="436436" wikidata="Q406972" url="?curid=436436" title="Scotiabank Arena">
<text>Scotiabank Arena, formerly known as Air Canada Centre (ACC), is a multi-purposed arena located on Bay Street in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the home of the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). In addition, the minor league Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Raptors 905 of the NBA G League play occasional games at the arena. The arena was previously home to the Toronto Phantoms of the Arena Football League (AFL) and the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League. Scotiabank Arena also hosts other events, such as concerts, political conventions and video game competitions.

The arena is in size. It is owned and operated by Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE), which also owns the Leafs and the Raptors, as well as their respective development teams. 

The building was constructed in 1941 as the Toronto Postal Delivery Building for postal deliveries and was temporarily used by the Department of National Defence during World War II. After the war, the building was transferred to Canada Post in 1946 where it functioned as the main postal terminal for Metropolitan Toronto until 1989 when Canada Post moved its services to the Eastern Avenue facility. The Postal Building was sold to a consortium of developers but was reverted to Canada Post ownership in 1993 due to financial woes, but the new ownership of the soon-to-be Toronto Raptors basketball team acquired the building in December 1994 to construct the new arena. However, the Raptors were acquired by Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., the owners of the Maple Leafs hockey team in 1998 during construction that began a year prior, to replace their outdated Maple Leaf Gardens arena. The arena was opened on February 19, 1999, at the cost of $288 million ($499 million as of 2022), with the Leafs playing the Montreal Canadiens the following night, and the Raptors playing the Vancouver Grizzlies the night after that.

In 2018, Scotiabank Arena was the 13th busiest arena in the world and the busiest in Canada. It is also the most photographed location in Canada on Instagram according to BuzzFeed. Scotiabank Arena is connected to Union Station&#x27;s railway, subway and regional bus services and is connected to the Path.

==History==
The venue is located on land that was once part of Toronto&#x27;s inner harbour. Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850s and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current-day shape of downtown. By 1858, the site was located between two wharves (Rees Wharf and Tinnings Wharf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under government control as possible locations for various Union Station expansions. The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900s. By 1925, the northern parcel of the property was turned into Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today&#x27;s Esplanade. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbour Terminals.

===Postal Delivery Building===
In the 1930s, the property became the proposed home to Canada Post&#x27;s Toronto Postal Delivery Building. In the 1920s, a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city&#x27;s then-new Union Station (Downtown Toronto&#x27;s third major train station). However, it quickly reached capacity by the 1930s due to major population growth of Toronto and its surrounding region. In 1937, the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay Street and Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard). Approval was granted by the federal Department of Public Works in part to stimulate the depression impacted construction industry. Design and construction of the warehouse built with steel and concrete would begin in 1938. Designed by Charles B. Dolphin, it is a building that incorporates a combination of Art Deco and Art Moderne architectural style. The original building would be built for around $2 million (CAD) ($ in dollars). The building was strategically located south of Union Station and was connected directly to the train platforms via an underground tunnel. Trains would be able to directly unload mail and move it directly to the mail sorting centre. 

Amid World War II, upon completion in 1941, the building would be temporarily handed over to the Department of National Defence for wartime storage purposes, and be finally turned over to Canada Post in 1946. Required modifications were made to the building to return it to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence. After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse, it was also the home of Postal Station &quot;A&quot;, which served mostly institutional and commercial clients. The ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity-fed mail chutes sorted by size and destination. Eventually, the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery. The building would be used as a postal sorting centre up until 1989.

====Postal building sculptures====
The structure&#x27;s most notable features, which have been retained, are the exterior 13-part series of limestone bas relief carvings by Louis Temporale Sr. CM, which depicts the history of transportation and communication in Canada. Carved in 1938–39, the bas relief begins with scenes showing human speech, a runner carrying a message, aboriginals communicating by smoke signal, a group of voyageurs, a schooner and a Royal Mail steamship crossing the Atlantic Ocean from England, the CN train used during the 1939 Royal Tour, the mythical flying boat named &#x27;Canopus&#x27; and northern travel by dog sled. The sculptor&#x27;s son Louis Temporale Jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years since the creation of the artwork. Being near the elevated Gardiner Expressway results in salt spray, which is speeding up the deterioration of the limestone.

====Moving postal operations====
In the late 1980s, the building and antiquated sorting equipment was in need of major renovations and expensive upgrades. In a cost-cutting move (part of larger overall service changes and cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the Brian Mulroney Progressive Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern circa 1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specifically for transport truck bulk delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building&#x27;s work was transferred here. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by numerous skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium and condo towers. In the early 1990s, real estate developers Bramalea Limited and Trizec arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, with plans to redevelop the site into a office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city and remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.

By this time, a deep prolonged recession had taken hold in the province, which saw many downtown Toronto high-rise construction projects paused or cancelled outright. There was limited market demand for new office space, one of the key requirements for acquiring bank loans. The resulting financing difficulties resulted in the building&#x27;s ownership being reverted to Canada Post in 1993 with the structure remaining unused and abandoned. The Toronto Raptors&#x27; owners purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.

===Multi-purpose arena===

By 1993, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. Three competing bids were entertained in July of the same year. The NBA Expansion committee visited the various proposed stadium sites. Major selling points to the committee were a downtown location, easy underground access to the subway and Path system and proximity to the business core, which would hopefully make corporate boxes enticing to corporations.

On September 30, 1993, the NBA awarded the team to Professional Basketball Franchise Inc. (PBF), a company headed by Canadian businessman John Bitove. The Toronto Raptors were created and were required as terms of the winning bid to provide a suitable arena to play in. As part of the PBF proposal, the Canada Post building was ultimately chosen to be the new home of the Raptors in part due to its downtown location, proposed design and features along with lot size. Other sites considered included government-owned lands at Exhibition Place, North York City Centre, and downtown at Bay Street and Wellesley Street (a site of the planned Canadian Opera Hall in the 1980s). Another site under consideration by the MLSE bid group was at Bay Street and Dundas Street and would have been part of the neighbouring Eaton Centre. PBF purchased the Canada Post building and the land the building is on for million.

The Raptors would initially play their first two seasons just a few hundred metres (a few thousand feet) away in the multipurpose SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) stadium while the arena was constructed. Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the Art Deco Queenston limestone façade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along Bay Street) and south (Lake Shore Boulevard) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing Union Station) was demolished to make room for the arena, through the process of facadism. The original building is protected under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;.

====Arena &#x27;Wars&#x27;====
When MLGL (Maple Leaf Gardens Limited, at the time, the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result, pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors&#x27; opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium was complete.

The 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans of their own to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how Madison Square Garden was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs. The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. &quot;This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us,&quot; stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs &quot;every step of the way&quot; and he did not understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site, claiming that the Leafs want to &quot;build virtually on top of us&quot;. The major problem of the Union Station proposal was that the land that the stadium would have been built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 million (in 1997 dollars) in cash and assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.

During this period, the Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena, and disputes over the future of the arena resulted in John Bitove being forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight as a result of a shotgun clause. Slaight—who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL—then had majority ownership and immediately went into talks with MLGL, which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena. This subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217 million, MLGL increased the budget to $265 million after taking control.

====Construction====

After the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre, the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL Construction with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24 months by March 1, 1999. The integration of the Maple Leafs into the new structure would result in a 25-percent increase in construction costs (over $25 million CAD in 1999).

The completed structure included a 15-storey tower (reduced from a proposed 30-storey tower), four restaurants, and an underground parking lot.

====Opening====
In 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, as the Toronto Blue Jays had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates. The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.
On December 30, 1998, the building&#x27;s construction was completed, nine days ahead of schedule. Opening events took place early the next year and Steve Stavro (who was the majority shareholder of MLGL) was named CEO. The initial hockey game took place February 20, 1999 (Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Montreal Canadiens), the first basketball Game on February 21, 1999 (Toronto Raptors vs. Vancouver Grizzlies), and the opening concert on February 22, 1999 (The Tragically Hip). Features of the new building consist of a arena and a office tower. There is also an east–west covered, climate-controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network. The Galleria also doubles as a historical museum by displaying numerous artifacts from the old Canada Post building.

In its first ten years of operation, the new arena had an estimated economic benefit of $2.4 billion. This boosted Toronto&#x27;s economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13 million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.

Air Canada purchased naming rights to the arena for US$30 million for 20 years. Several nicknames for the arena would emerge including &#x27;The Hangar&#x27;, but it would be the acronym &#x27;ACC&#x27; that became the most commonly referenced shorthand for the venue and is still commonly used by local residents, even after the venue was renamed Scotiabank Arena, out of habit and nostalgia, rather than in opposition to commercialism as is the case of the nearby SkyDome (later renamed Rogers Centre), given that it still had a commercial name.

====21st century====

In 2003, MLSE completed a $5-million upgrade of the arena, including a new LED signage system. During the summer of 2015, a $10-million upgrade of the arena was carried out, which included the installation of a new scoreboard four times larger than the previous one. The old scoreboard was later installed at Ricoh Coliseum in Exhibition Place.

In the winter of 2003–2004, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario imposed a seven-day penalty on the arena for &quot;permitting drunken patrons to be in the licensed patrons&quot; in the fall of 2002 at a Toronto Maple Leafs game and also a Rolling Stones concert. As a result of these misdemeanours, there was no alcohol served at the arena from December 21 to 28 in 2003. The venue had multiple major events during this time frame, which included a Toronto Raptors–Orlando Magic game on December 21, a Toronto Maple Leafs–Florida Panthers game on December 23, and Disney on Ice: &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, which ran from December 25, 2003, to January 1, 2004.

On September 6, 2014, a group of statues known as &quot;Legends Row&quot; was unveiled outside the arena at the southwest corner of the building. The statues were situated in multiple waves from 2014 to 2016 and include Ted Kennedy, Johnny Bower, Darryl Sittler, Borje Salming, Syl Apps, George Armstrong, Mats Sundin, Dave Keon, Turk Broda, and Tim Horton. In 2017, the final four statues were unveiled including Red Kelly, Frank Mahovlich, Charlie Conacher, and Wendel Clark. &quot;Legends Row&quot; now features 14 life-sized statues of former Maple Leaf players alongside a granite players&#x27; bench.
The Air Canada Centre was renamed Scotiabank Arena on July 1, 2018. The landmark 20-year sponsorship agreement between Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment and Scotiabank is worth about C$800 million. This is believed to be the highest-priced annual building and team sponsorship in North American sports history. The arena is the third in Canada to bear naming rights to Scotiabank.

During the 2020–21 NBA season the Toronto Raptors relocated their home games to Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto. The Raptors played their first home game at Scotiabank Arena since the pandemic on October 20, 2021, losing to the Washington Wizards 98–83.

On May 11, 2021, Toronto Rock announced the relocation from Scotiabank Arena in Toronto to FirstOntario Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, beginning with the 2021–22 NLL season in December. The team retained the name &quot;Toronto Rock&quot; while in Hamilton.

On June 27, 2021, Scotiabank Arena was used as a COVID-19 vaccine pop-up clinic for 26,771 people. This clinic set a new record for the most COVID-19 vaccinations delivered at a single location in North America, beating out a pop-up drive-thru clinic that vaccinated 17,003 people at the Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas.

A $350 million renovation of the arena, planned over several phases, was announced in October 2023. Preliminary phases of the project, which included a new video screen in Maple Leaf Square, had commenced in 2019, with major work completed in the summers of 2023 and 2024, during the off-seasons of both the Maple Leafs and the Raptors.

==Maple Leaf Square==
In late 2005, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment announced that they would be renovating the western side of the Air Canada Centre during the 2008 off-season to connect it with the Maple Leaf Square development. Maple Leaf Square is jointly owned by MLSE, Cadillac Fairview and Lantera Developments. The $500 million development includes two restaurants, Hotel Le Germain at Maple Leaf Square boutique hotel, extensive retail shopping, including a Leafs, Marlies, Raptors, and Toronto FC store, two 54-storey condominiums, a Longo&#x27;s supermarket, and a public square. It opened in 2010. The two-year, $48 million renovation of the ACC added a new atrium that includes a High-Definition broadcast studio for Leafs Nation Network (formerly Leafs TV), NBA TV Canada and GolTV Canada.

The outside wall of the atrium features a video screen overlooking the plaza, which often broadcasts games taking place inside the arena. During NHL and NBA playoff runs, the square attracts thousands of Leafs and Raptors fans, respectively, sometimes broadcasting away playoff matches featuring the Leafs and/or the Raptors as well. A section of the square is designated Ford Fan Zone at Maple Leaf Square, with naming rights given to the Ford Motor Company of Canada. During Raptors playoff runs, the square has acquired the nickname &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; after the 1993 film adaptation that inspired the team&#x27;s name. During the 2019 NBA playoffs and especially during the victorious 2019 NBA Finals, other city squares across Canada also acquired the Jurassic Park nickname, such as in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<text>Pashtunwali (), also known as Pakhtunwali and Afghaniyat, is the traditional lifestyle or a code of honour and tribal code of the Pashtun people, from Afghanistan and Pakistan, by which they live. Many scholars widely have interpreted it as being &quot;the way of the Pashtuns&quot; or &quot;the code of life&quot;. Pashtunwali is widely practised by Pashtuns in the Pashtun-dominated regions. Pashtunwali dates back to ancient pre-Islamic times.

==Overview==

The native Pashtun tribes, often described as fiercely independent people, have inhabited the Pashtunistan region (eastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan) since at least the 1st millennium BC. During that period, much of their mountainous territory has remained outside government rule or control. Pashtun resistance to outside rule and the terrain they reside in is sometimes speculated to be why Indigenous Pashtuns still follow the &quot;code of life&quot;.

Pashtunwali rules are accepted in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also in some Pashtun communities around the world. Some non-Pashtun Afghans and others have also adopted its ideology or practices for their own benefit. Conversely, many urbanized Pashtuns tend to ignore the rules of Pashtunwali. Passed on from generation to generation, Pashtunwali guides both individual and communal conduct. Practiced by the majority of Pashtuns, it helps to promote Pashtunization.

Pashtuns embrace an ancient traditional, spiritual, and communal identity tied to a set of moral codes and rules of behaviour, as well as to a record of history spanning some seventeen hundred years.

Pashtunwali promotes self-respect, independence, justice, hospitality, love, forgiveness, revenge and tolerance toward all (especially to strangers or guests). It is considered to be the personal responsibility of every Pashtun to discover and rediscover Pashtunwali&#x27;s essence and meaning.

::The Pashtun tribes are always engaged in private or public war. Every man is a warrior, a politician and a theologian. Every large house is a real feudal fortress. ... Every family cultivates its vendetta; every clan, its feud. ... Nothing is ever forgotten and very few debts are left unpaid. 
:::Winston Churchill 

==Pashtun institutions==
Pashtuns are organised into tribal or extended family groups often led by a &quot;Malik&quot; (a wealthy and influential leader from the group).
Disputes within clans are settled by a jirga (traditionally a tribal assembly involving all adult males).
In times of foreign invasion, Pashtuns have been known to unite under Pashtun religious leaders such as Saidullah Baba in the Siege of Malakand and even under Pashtána female leaders such as Malalai of Maiwand in the Battle of Maiwand.

==Main principles==

Although not exclusive, the following thirteen principles form the major components of Pashtunwali.

The three primary principles:

#Hospitality () – Showing hospitality and respect to all visitors, regardless of race, religion, nationality or wealth, without any expectation of repayment. Pashtuns will go to great lengths to show their hospitality.
#Asylum () – Protection given to a fugitive from his enemies, at all costs. Even those running from the law must be given refuge until the situation can be clarified. Nənawā́te can also be used when the vanquished party in a dispute pleads for forgiveness in the house of the victors, a form of chivalrous surrender. In a notable example, US Navy officer Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of a US Navy SEAL team ambushed by Taliban fighters, was aided by members of the Pashtun Sabray tribe. The tribal chief Mohammed Gulab gave the soldier refuge in his village, fending off attacking tribes until he was returned to nearby US forces.
#Justice and revenge () – To seek justice or take revenge against a wrongdoer. No time limit restricts the revenge period. Even a mere taunt () may count as a mortal insult. Monetary compensation can be an alternative to &quot;badal&quot;, for example to expiate murder.

The other main principles:
#Bravery (). A Pashtun must defend his land, property, and family from intruders, killing them if provoked.
#Loyalty (). A Pashtun must be loyal to family, friends and tribe members.
#Kindness (). Pashtuns should act for the welfare of others.
#Arbitration (). Disputes are to be resolved through the Jirga.
#Faith () Trust in Allah. The notion of trusting in the Creator generally equates to Islamic monotheism (&quot;tawhid&quot;).
#Respect () and pride (). A Pashtun man&#x27;s pride must be respected, and he must respect himself and others, especially strangers. Respect begins at home, among family members and relatives. A man without respect is unworthy of being a Pashtun. In the poetry of Khushal Khattak, “The loss of life and wealth should not matter, what matters is &quot;pat&quot;.&quot;
#Female honour (). A Pashtun must defend the honor of women at all costs and must protect them from all harm and disrespect.
#Honour (). A Pashtun must defend the weak around him.
#Manhood or chivalry (). A Pashtun must demonstrate courage. A turban is considered a symbol of chivalry.
#Country (). A Pashtun is obliged to protect the land of the Pashtuns and the traditional customs.

<doc id="436449" wikidata="Q6064353" url="?curid=436449" title="2004 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses">
<text>The 2004 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses were an election held on January 19 as part of the United States presidential primary. They were the first major test of some of the leading contenders for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination as its candidate for the 2004 United States presidential election.

==Candidates==
* Howard Dean, former governor of Vermont
* John Edwards, U.S. senator from North Carolina
* Dick Gephardt, U.S. representative from Missouri
* John Kerry, U.S. senator from Massachusetts
* Dennis Kucinich, U.S. representative from Ohio

==Campaign==
The first contenders for the nomination arrived in Iowa almost two years before the caucuses were held. The first to arrive were Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean, who began to make occasional speeches there and started to build an organization. In 2003, John Kerry, John Edwards, Carol Moseley Braun, and Dennis Kucinich all began to campaign heavily in the state.

Gephardt went into the campaign with high expectations. He was from a neighboring state, Missouri, had strong union backing, and he had won the state in 1988. During 2003, however, Howard Dean began to grow in popularity across the country on a strong anti-war message that appealed to the party base. Gephardt continued to do well, but Kerry and Edwards both sank to single-digit levels of support. Kucinich and Moseley Braun were never considered strong contenders and polled poorly throughout the campaign.

Three of the Democratic candidates sat out the caucuses. Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton did not believe they could get sufficient support in the state and concentrated their efforts on New Hampshire. Wesley Clark got into the race too late to be competitive in Iowa.

On January 10, Howard Dean got a major boost when Iowa&#x27;s senior Senator Tom Harkin endorsed him. On January 15, Carol Moseley Braun withdrew from the race and also threw her support behind Dean.

During the last weeks of the campaign, however, the polls began to indicate a significant change in support. Dean and Gephardt had been hammering each other with negative advertisements, and both began losing support to revived Edwards and Kerry campaigns. Edwards received a major boost when he was endorsed by Iowa&#x27;s largest newspaper.

Shortly before the caucus, Edwards and Kucinich reached an agreement in which they would ask their supporters to back the other camp in any precinct where they lacked the necessary numbers to qualify for delegates. The deal was widely seen as a blow to the Gephardt campaign, which had expected to pick up the compatibly pro-union Kucinich supporters in such circumstances.

==Results==
The results were very similar to that indicated by last-minute polling but were a surprise compared with weeks earlier.

Source: &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;

It was reported that 124,331 Iowans participated in the caucuses. The initial county caucuses assigned delegates for further caucuses with delegates not being bound to vote for the candidate. Actual delegates to the Democratic National Convention would be chosen later: 29 at the district caucuses on April 24, 2004 and 16 at the state convention on June 12, 2004. Besides these 45 delegates assigned through the caucus system, 10 other delegates are assigned by the state party and one is elected at large at the state convention. The successful candidate at the 2004 Democratic National Convention required approximately 2,160 delegates to win the nomination.

The results showed a similar pattern across the state. Dean failed to win the support of the college areas as he had hoped, and Gephardt was not successful in winning the union areas.

==Consequences==
The Iowa caucuses revived the once moribund campaign of Kerry, who proceeded to the New Hampshire primary as one of the front-runners, and ultimately captured the Democratic nomination. Edwards, who had been written off even more than Kerry, used the Iowa results and the later South Carolina primary to give him another boost.

The results were a blow to Dean, who had for weeks been expected to win the caucuses. He planned afterward to move quickly to New Hampshire where he expected to do well and regain momentum. At the time, he had far more money than any other candidate and did not spend much of it in Iowa. Dean&#x27;s aggressive post-caucus speech to his supporters, culminating with a hoarse scream that came to be known as the Dean scream, was widely shown and mocked on television, although the effect on his campaign was unclear.

The results were disastrous for Dick Gephardt. He had frequently stated that a win in Iowa was essential for his candidacy. He had been seen as the front-runner for well over a year but ended up fourth, effectively ending his campaign. He cancelled planned campaign stops in New Hampshire and dropped out of the race on January 20.

Dennis Kucinich was never expected to win much support in Iowa. His fifth-place finish did not affect his plans to continue campaigning.

<text>Finders, keepers, sometimes extended as the children&#x27;s rhyme finders, keepers; losers, weepers, is an English adage with the premise that when something is unowned or abandoned, whoever finds it first can claim it for themself permanently. The phrase relates to an ancient Roman law of similar meaning and has been expressed in various ways over the centuries. The 1982 English Court of Appeal case &quot;Parker v British Airways Board&quot; expanded the phrase, with the judgement of Donaldson L.J. declaring &quot;Finders keepers, unless the true owner claims the article&quot;. Difficulties arise when exploring how best to define when exactly something is unowned or abandoned, which can lead to legal or ethical disputes, especially as jurisdictions often differ in their approach.

==Application==
*One of the most common uses of &quot;Finders, Keepers&quot; involves shipwrecks. Under international maritime law, for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a salvage operation.
* Philosophies, such as anarcho-capitalism, that advocate a right to own land and other natural resources often appeal to the doctrine of finders keepers in the case of claiming ownership of what was previously unowned (see &quot;terra nullius&quot;).
* In the United States, the Homestead Act allowed people to claim land as their own as long as it was originally unowned and the property was then developed by the claimant.
* In the field of social simulation, Rosaria Conte and Cristiano Castelfranchi have used &quot;finders, keepers&quot; as a case study for simulating the evolution of norms in simple societies.

<doc id="436461" wikidata="Q649955" url="?curid=436461" title="Dum Dum">
<text>Dum Dum is a city and a municipality in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area of North 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport locally known as Kolkata Airport, is situated at Dum Dum. Dum Dum area was divided into three parts governed by three seperate municipalities named as South Dum Dum, Dum Dum and North Dum Dum.

==Etymology==
During the 19th century the area was home to the Dum Dum Arsenal, a British Royal Artillery facility. It was here that, in the early 1890s, Captain Neville Bertie-Clay developed a bullet with the jacket cut away at the tip to reveal its soft lead core (see hollow-point bullet), known informally as a dum-dum or more correctly as an expanding bullet. The previous name of Dum Dum was &quot;Domdoma&quot;.

Some resources claim that the Persian word damdama, which means &quot;mound&quot; or &quot;elevated battery&quot;, is the source of the word Dum Dum.

==History==


In the history of Bengal, Dum Dum holds a very significant place. Dum Dum was sparsely populated before the British came there. The area was slightly elevated. On 6 February 1757, an accord was signed at Dum Dum by the Nawab of Bengal to allow the British to build forts at Calcutta, Dacca and Kashim Bazar. In 1783, a cantonment was established at Dum Dum. Military barracks were built and civilians started coming in to provide essential services to the military personnel. A Cantonment Board was formed to provide civic amenities. On 9 February 1822, the foundation stone was blessed and laid for Saint Patrick’s Chapel. On Good Friday in 1823, the chapel was dedicated and inaugurated with Irish priest M. Murphy as its chaplain. The ordnance factory was established at Dum Dum in 1846. The St. Stephens Church, a Roman Catholic Church Weslyan Chapel and a hospital for treatment of European were established in the central hub of Dum Dum Cantonment of old Dum Dum. It may be noted that both South Dum Dum Municipality and North Dum Dum Municipality were established in 1870 thereby somewhat defining administratively the different parts of an earlier undefined Dum Dum area. subsequently, Dum Dum was enlarged by the amalgamation of Kadihati municipality in 1883.


Dum Dum was once a separate subdivision from 1861 to 1896. During the early years of the cantonment the British waged several imperial wars, out of which the wars in Burma, Nepal, the Deccan and Afganisthan were costly in blood and lives. Two monuments were erected to commemorate their memory. The Afghan War Memorial was built in Dum Dum in 1841 after the British lost the first Anglo-Afghan war. During the 1857 disturbances the Indian sepoys posted at Dum Dum were affected and Mangal Pandey was hanged from a tree at Dum Dum (his dead body was probably hanged at both Barrackpore and Dum Dum Cantonment). Dum Dum Cantonment was closed down and the Cantonment Board was replaced by Dum Dum Municipality in 1929. The temporary set back to Dum Dum arising from abolition of the cantonment and departure of British troops, was partially made up with the shifting of Jessop &amp; Co. from Howrah to Dum Dum in 1928 and establishment of the Gramophone Company at Dum Dum in 1929. Bengal Flying Club, established in 1920, had a small fleet of single engine moth planes. The independence movement led to the sudden development of the Central Jail, where many top leaders and more numerous unknown patriots were lodged. The old military barracks made way for multi-storied jail barracks. The environment quite often reverberated with the chanting of &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;.

With the partition of Bengal in 1947, &quot;millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile East Pakistan.&quot; In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but &quot;it was squatters who made the East Bengali refugees famous or infamous&quot;. Squatting () ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. &quot;This happened as early as 1948 with middle class refugees in the Jadavpur area: first on government land and then on private property, leading to violent clashes. Having won the battle, the elated squatters named their colony &#x27;Bijaygarh&#x27;, the Fort of Victory.&quot; By 1949, there were 40 such colonies in Jadavpur, Kasba, Santoshpur, Garia and Behala, in the south-eastern part of the city, and 65 in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone in the north. Subsequently squatters colonies also came up along the west bank of the Hooghly and by 1950, there were 150 such colonies. It has to be borne in mind that the squatters were in a way &quot;self-settlers&quot; in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government or administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres. Efforts have been made in more recent years to regularise land/property rights in the refugee colonies.

==Economy==
===Industry===
The following industrial units are located in Dum Dum:

* Ordnance Factory Dum Dum is a modern factory with unique high precision machining systems such as laser cutting, CNC-operated injection moulding and CNC machines for carrying out stringent quality products. The factory was initiated when Robert Clive recaptured Calcutta from Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, in 1757. It became the first development centre for defence stores in India established by the Royal forces. When the Gun &amp; Shell Factory was established at Cossipore it worked in tandem with the Gun &amp; Shell Factory at Dum Dum. After the disastrous First Anglo-Afghan War, the first ammunition factory in British India was set up here. It produced expanding bullets, which came to be known as &quot;dumdums&quot; after the city where they were manufactured. The 1857 mutiny was sparked by inputs from this factory. The site was also used as a jail and many freedom fighters were hanged here. Hearsay includes the Santal leader Kanhu Murmu. The ammunition factory was shifted to Pune in 1869, but the ordnance factory continued to function at Dum Dum.
* Jessop &amp; Company, located at Dum Dum, was a leading engineering company since 1788, when Breen &amp; Company was founded in Calcutta. In 1820, Henry and George, sons of William Jessop, acquired, on behalf of Butterley Company, Breen &amp; Company. Butterley Company was founded in Derbyshire, England. Butterley Company and Breen &amp; Company merged to form Jessop &amp; Company in 1820. The company was a pioneer in the engineering field and had many feathers in its cap. During 1815–1840 it built the first iron bridge (loha-ka-pul) in India, across the Gomti at Lucknow. It floated the first steam boat in Indian waters in 1819, manufactured the first steam roller for Indian roads in 1890, and produced the first electrical multiple unit (EMU) coach for Indian railways in 1959. In 1973, the company was taken over by the Government of India and in 1986, it became a subsidiary of the holding company Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam. In 2003, as part of the strategic disinvestment of the NDA government, the Kolkata-based Ruia Group, headed by Pawan Kumar Ruia, took charge of loss-making Jessop. Pawan Kumar Ruia has successfully turned around Jessop.
* The Dum Dum recording studio of Saregama, a part of the factory with production facilities, was established in 1928. It holds &quot;around 30,000 master tapes of original Indian music recorded by the company since Gauhar Jaan sang &quot;raga&quot; Jogiya in Kolkata and became the first Indian voice to be recorded on shellac disc in 1902.&quot; In the studio &quot;text and photographs of artistes from Hindustani and Carnatic classical, Hindi and south Indian playback, devotional and Bengali music, who have recorded with the company, are also exhibited along with a copy of the original agreement that Tagore signed with the company before cutting his first musical record at the Dum Dum studio in 1928.&quot; The tapes are in at least 19 major Indian languages. The collection includes speeches of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. In the world of music the list is too long for elaboration here but it includes the voice of Kazi Nazrul Islam.

<text>The Frontier March of Posen–West Prussia (; ) was a province of Prussia from 1920/1922 to 1938, covering most of lands of historical Greater Poland that were not included in the Second Polish Republic. Posen–West Prussia was established in 1922 as a province of the Free State of Prussia within Weimar Germany, formed from merging three remaining non-contiguous territories of Posen and West Prussia, which had lost the majority of their territory to the Second Polish Republic following the Greater Poland Uprising. From 1934, Posen–West Prussia was &quot;de facto&quot; ruled by Brandenburg until it was dissolved by Nazi Germany, effective 1 October 1938 and its territory divided between the provinces of Pomerania, Brandenburg and Silesia. Schneidemühl (present-day Piła) was the provincial capital. Today, lands of the province are entirely contained within Poland.

== Background ==

Until the late 18th century partitions of Poland, the lands which made up Posen–West Prussia had been part of the Greater Poland and East Pomeranian (Pomerelian) regions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and were administratively parts of the Poznań, Gniezno (Kalisz before 1768) and Pomeranian Voivodeships. Following the First Partition in 1772 the Kingdom of Prussia established the West Prussian province and the Netze District on annexed Pomerelian and Greater Polish (and Kuyavian) territories respectively. The South Prussian province was established following the Second Partition of 1793 and included the remainder of Greater Poland among other territories; the Third Partition in 1795 ended the existence of the Polish state entirely.
In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, South Prussia, the Kulmerland (part of West Prussia) and part of the Netze District, along with New Silesia and New East Prussia (excluding the area around Białystok which was ceded to Russia) were ceded to the Napoleonic client Duchy of Warsaw; Danzig was also detached from West Prussia as the Free City of Danzig. The parts of the Netze District which remained within the Kingdom of Prussia were incorporated into West Prussia. After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Duchy of Warsaw was re-partitioned between the Grand Duchy of Posen under Prussia, the Kingdom of Poland under Russia and the Free City of Cracow (a joint protectorate of Austria, Prussia, and Russia); Danzig returned to West Prussia. The Grand Duchy of Posen was mostly made up of former parts of South Prussia and the Netze District, but also included the Kulmerland which had been part of West Prussia before 1807; the Kulmerland was restored to West Prussia in 1817.

In 1829 West Prussia and East Prussia were merged to form the Province of Prussia, but they were restored in 1878.

Both Posen and West Prussia lay beyond the borders of the German Confederation and Posen was, at least nominally, semi-autonomous. Their population was predominantly Catholic and Polish-speaking, while a sizable Protestant German minority settled mainly in the western parts. Posen lost its semi-autonomous status after the failed Greater Poland Uprising of 1848, becoming the Province of Posen. With Prussia, these provinces became part of the North German Confederation in 1867 and the unified German Empire in 1871. Ethnic tensions were exacerbated by the Germanisation policies of the Berlin government and the anti-Catholic measures enacted by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.

== History ==
Upon the German defeat in World War I, another Greater Poland Uprising broke out in 1918, which aimed to incorporate the lands once annexed by Prussia into a re-established Polish state. The forces of the Polish Military Organisation were able to oust the German administration from the bulk of the Greater Polish lands, whereafter the Posen governor (&quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;) Ernst von Heyking was forced to retire to Meseritz (Międzyrzecz) and &quot;de facto&quot; only ruled over the far western, predominantly German settled districts at the border with the adjacent Prussian provinces of Pomerania, Brandenburg and Silesia.

The Polish advance was halted, after the German forces had re-organised in several &quot;Freikorps&quot; units and the demarcation line became the basis of the ruling by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, adjudicating the parts occupied by Polish forces &quot;uti possidetis&quot; to the Second Polish Republic. The governmental power of the German administration was confined to the smaller western parts of Posen and West Prussia, the Prussian state government was represented by the former Bromberg supervisor (&quot;Regierungspräsident&quot;) Friedrich von Bülow, who relocated his administrative seat to Schneidemühl. With the entry into force of the German &quot;Ostmark&quot; law on 1 July 1922, the province was created out of those smaller western parts of former Posen and West Prussia that remained with the Weimar Republic.

In view of the previous clashes of arms and the &quot;lost&quot; territories, the remaining German population from the beginning had a strong nationalistic attitude, with the national conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) emerging as the strongest political power in the provincial elections. Friedrich von Bülow, himself a member of the national liberal German People&#x27;s Party, remained &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; until his retirement in 1933, whereafter he was succeeded by the Meseritz DNVP politician Hans von Meibom. After the DNVP dissolved in the course of the Nazi &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; process, von Meibom was disempowered and replaced by the Nazi &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of neighbouring Brandenburg, Wilhelm Kube. Kube, notorious for his corruption, ruled over both provinces until he was deposed after entering into a conflict with the Nazi jurist Walter Buch, father-in-law of mighty Martin Bormann. Posen–West Prussia was further on ruled with Brandenburg under Nazi &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; Emil Stürtz until it was dissolved in 1938, when its territory was divided between the adjacent provinces of Silesia, Pomerania and Brandenburg.

== Subdivision ==
Despite the name, the city of Posen (Polish: Poznań) was no longer part of the province, as it had become the capital of the re-established Greater Polish Poznań Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. The capital of the Prussian &quot;Posen-Westpreußen&quot; province and seat of the supervisor was Schneidemühl. The seat of the province&#x27;s elected by the assembly remained at Meseritz.

== Administration ==
The office of an (i.e. upper president) appointed by the Prussian state government had to carry out central prerogatives on the provincial level and to supervise the implementation of central policy on the lower levels of administration.

As to common interests and tasks to be fulfilled on the provincial level, such as schools, traffic installations, hospitals, cultural institutions, sanitary premises, jails etc., the urban and rural districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) within each province (sometimes within each government region) formed a corporation with common assets to these ends, called (provincial association, or – within government regions or smaller entities – or , i.e. municipal or regional association). Since 1875 all provinces had this double identity, being based on central Prussian prerogatives from above, on the one hand, and being bottom-up corporations of province-wide or region-wide self-rule, on the other hand. Initially, the assemblies of the urban and rural districts elected representatives for the provincial diets (; or as to regional diets, the so-called ), which were thus indirectly elected.

After the end of the Prussian monarchy, the provincial or regional diets were all directly elected by the citizens of the provinces (or regions, respectively), with direct elections first held in 1921 and 1922. These parliaments legislated within the competences transferred to the provincial or regional associations. Before the formal establishment of the new Province, the rural and urban district assemblies elected representatives for the Posen–West Prussia, legislating within the competences of the former Posen and West Prussia provincial associations and its premises within the territory of the future Posen–West Prussia. After the formal formation of the province, its parliament was called the provincial diet of Posen–West Prussia which elected a provincial executive body (government), the provincial committee (), and a head of province, the (&quot;Land Captain&quot;).

===Oberpräsident===

* 1934–1936: Wilhelm Kube, NSDAP (acting), of Brandenburg
* 1936–1938: Emil Stürtz, NSDAP, of Brandenburg

===Landeshauptmann===
* 1922–1933: Johannes Caspari, SPD
* 1933–1938: Hermann Fiebing, NSDAP

== Population ==
*1910: 309,200 (in areas which later became parts of this province)
*1919: 326,900
*1925: 332,400
*1933: 470,600

== Polish minority ==

After the Treaty of Versailles came into force, some members of the local Polish minority emigrated to Poland. In 1925, 13,284 people declared themselves to be either Polish-speaking or bilingual German/Polish. This corresponded to a population share of 4.3%. The share of the vote of the Polish-Catholic People&#x27;s Party was stable at around 3% in all state and Reichstag elections in the Weimar Republic. The settlement centers of the Polish minority were unevenly distributed. According to the census of 1925, the districts of Bomst (20.6%), Flatow (16.8%) and Meseritz (5.8%) had the highest proportions of Polish speakers (including bilinguals). A special achievement of the Polish minority was the establishment of a network of Polish private schools.

<text>Kollagunta Gopalaiyer Ramanathan (13 November 1920 – 10 May 1992) was an Indian mathematician known for his work in number theory. His contributions are also to the general development of mathematical research, and teaching in India.

==K. G. Ramanathan&#x27;s early life and his family==
K. G. Ramanathan was born in Hyderabad, South India, on 13 November 1920 to Sri Kollagunta Gopal Iyer and Smt. Anantalakshmi, and was one of three children in the family.

Ramanathan received his early education from Wesleyan Mission High School in Secunderabad. He further pursued his academic interests in mathematics and obtained a BA degree from Nizam College, Hyderabad, in 1940. Later, in 1942, he completed his master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Loyola College in Chennai (then known as Madras). Sources state that Ramanathan&#x27;s academic journey was also influenced by mathematics teacher and Jesuit priest, Rev Fr. C Racine, who was a former student of the renowned French mathematician E Cartan.

With a keen passion for teaching and research in mathematics, Ramanathan worked as an assistant lecturer at Annamalai University in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu from 1945 to 1946. He then joined Osmania University, Hyderabad as a lecturer for the following two years. In 1948, he became a research scholar at the University of Madras, where he had the opportunity to work alongside esteemed mathematicians including Professors R Vaidhyanathaswamy and T Vijayraghavan. In the same year, Ramanathan received an invitation to attend the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at Princeton. Whilst there, Ramanathan worked alongside Hermann Weyl and Carl Siegel, and is said to have sung Carnatic songs of Tyagaraja to the legendary physicist Albert Einstein, who was Ramanathan&#x27;s neighbour at the university. Until 1951, along with Emil Artin, Siegel supervised Ramanathan in his PhD studies in mathematics.

Following the successful completion of his PhD, Ramanathan returned to India to team up with K. S. Chandrasekharan at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) at Colaba in 1951.

Ramanathan was married to Jayalakshmi Ramanathan. He had two sons. His mother died at an early age.

==Career==
At TIFR, he built up the number theory group of young mathematicians from India. For several years, he took interest to study Ramanujan&#x27;s unpublished and published work. He was an editorial board member of Acta Arithmetica for over 30 years. He retired from TIFR in 1985.

===Awards===
Ramanathan was given numerous achievements during his more than 30 years service at TIFR.

* Padma Bhushan, 1983
* Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, 1965
* Fellow of Indian Academy of Sciences
* Fellow of Indian National Science Academy
* Honorary fellow of TIFR.

<doc id="436502" wikidata="Q1113659" url="?curid=436502" title="Battle of Fulford">
<text>The Battle of Fulford was fought on the outskirts of the village of Fulford, just south of York in England, on 20 September 1066, when King Harald III of Norway, also known as &quot;Harald Hardrada&quot;, a claimant to the English throne and Tostig Godwinson, his English ally, fought and defeated the Northern Earls Edwin and Morcar.

Hardrada&#x27;s army consisted of allies from Orkney and a contingent with Tostig, as well as those coming from Norway. They crossed the sea in a fleet of ships and made their base east of York at Ricall. On 20 September 1066 the Vikings advanced towards York. The largely inexperienced Saxon army led by Morcar at York and Edwin at Tadcaster moved to block the invaders. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that the opposing armies met on the left bank of the River Ouse and that initially the Saxons caused heavy losses on the Viking army. Ultimately, the Norse army overwhelmed the Saxon army although the earls themselves survived this defeat. After winning, the victorious Norwegians entered York, gathered supplies, and asked for hostages.

==Background==
The Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor died on 5 January 1066 without an heir. The only surviving male member of the royal family was Edgar the Ætheling, the young son of Edward the Exile, who was aged about fourteen. On the day of King Edward&#x27;s funeral, 6 January, Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, rushed to London, where he was crowned king in the Abbey of Saint Peter of Westminster, by Ealdred, Archbishop of York. Harold Godwinson was elected as King by the Witenagemot, who had gathered in Westminster to celebrate the feast of Epiphany. However, two powerful earls, brothers Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria, challenged his authority. Sources indicate that Harold moved north to confront them; however, in the end he secured their loyalty by marrying their sister, Edith, the widow of Griffith of Wales. By securing the loyalty of Edwin and Morcar, Godwinson increased his strength in the north. These men were, in fact, the first barrier between Harold Godwinson and Harald Hardrada.

Tostig, the exiled brother of Godwinson, also felt he had a claim to the English throne. During his exile, he lived in Flanders, from where, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he invaded England in May 1066 against his brother. At Sandwich, Tostig is said to have enlisted and impressed sailors. He then sailed north, where he battled Edwin, the Earl of Mercia. After a quick defeat at the mouth of the Humber, he arrived in Scotland under the protection of King Malcolm III. Later he met, and made a pact with, Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, whereby he agreed to support Hardrada in his invasion of England. The medieval historian Orderic Vitalis has a different version of this story; he says that Tostig travelled to Normandy to enlist the help of William, Duke of Normandy.Then, as William was not ready to get involved at that stage, Tostig sailed from the Cotentin Peninsula, but because of storms ended up in Norway, and made his pact with Harald Hardrada there. Whether in Norway or Scotland, it is certain that Tostig allied himself with Hardrada, as they fought side by side at the Battle of Fulford. Tostig was a useful ally for Hardrada not only because he was the brother of his adversary, but also because he knew the terrain.

Hardrada was a claimant to the throne, just like Tostig, William and Harold Godwinson; he set sail for England in September 1066, stopping in Orkney to resupply, before merging his forces with Tostig&#x27;s soldiers and ships. Together they sailed along the River Ouse towards the city of York. In Orderic Vitalis&#x27;s version, it says that in the month of August Hardrada and Tostig set sail across the wide sea with a favourable wind and landed in Yorkshire. They arrived at the mouth of the Humber on 18 September. Having disembarked from their ships, their armies quickly moved towards York. On 20 September 1066, they were confronted by Harold Godwinson&#x27;s earls, Edwin and Morcar.

==Battle==

===Deployment===
Edwin had brought some soldiers to the east to prepare for an invasion by the Norwegians. The battle started with the English spreading their forces out to secure their flanks. On their right flank was the River Ouse, and on the left was the Fordland, a swampy area. The disadvantage to the position was that it gave Harald higher ground, which was perfect for seeing the battle from a distance. Another disadvantage was that if one flank were to give way, the other one would be in trouble. If the Anglo-Saxon army had to retreat, it would not be able to because of the marshlands. They would have to hold off the Norwegians as long as possible.

Harald&#x27;s army approached from three routes to the south. Harald lined his army up to oppose the Anglo-Saxons, but he knew it would take hours for all of his troops to arrive. His least experienced troops were sent to the right and his best troops were on the riverbank.

===English charge===
The English struck first, advancing on the Norwegian army before it could fully deploy. Morcar&#x27;s troops pushed Harald&#x27;s back into the marshlands, making progress against the weaker section of the Norwegian line. However, this initial success proved insufficient for victory to the English army, as the Norwegians brought their better troops to bear upon them, still fresh against the weakened Anglo-Saxons.

===Harald&#x27;s counter-move===
Harald brought more of his troops from the right flank to attack the centre, and sent more men to the river. The invaders were outnumbered, but they kept pushing and shoving the defenders back. The Anglo-Saxons were forced to give ground. Edwin&#x27;s soldiers who were defending the bank now were cut off from the rest of the army by the marsh, so they headed back to the city to make a final stand. Within another hour, the men on the beck were forced off by the Norwegians. Other invading Norwegians, who were still arriving, found a way to get around the thick fighting and opened a third front against the Anglo-Saxons. Outnumbered and outmanoeuvred, the defenders were defeated. Edwin and Morcar however, managed to survive the fight.

York surrendered to the Norwegians under the promise that the victors would not force entry to their city, perhaps because Tostig would not want his capital looted. It was arranged that the various hostages should be brought in and the Norwegian army retired to Stamford Bridge, east of York, to await their arrival.

==Aftermath==
It has been estimated that at Fulford the Norwegians had about 10,000 troops, of whom 6,000 were deployed in the battle, and the defenders 5,000. During the battle, casualties were heavy on both sides. Some estimates claim 15% dead giving a total of 1,650 (based on 11,000 troops being deployed in the battle). From all accounts, it is clear that the mobilised power of Mercia and Northumbria was cut to pieces at Fulford.

Because of the defeat at Fulford, King Harold II had to force-march his troops , from London to York. He did this within a week of Fulford and managed to surprise the Viking army and defeat them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In the meantime William, Duke of Normandy, had landed his army in Sussex on the south coast. Harold marched his army back down to the south coast where he met William&#x27;s army, at a place now called Battle just outside Hastings. It is probable that Harold&#x27;s intention was to repeat his success at Stamford Bridge by catching Duke William unawares. The Anglo-Norman chronicler Florence of Worcester commented that although the king (Harold) was aware that some of the bravest men in England had fallen in two recent battles and that half of his troops were not assembled, he did not hesitate to meet the enemy in Sussex. It is likely that the engagements at Fulford and at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, fought within a week of each other, seriously affected Harold&#x27;s strength at the Battle of Hastings some three weeks later. There is no doubt that if Harold had not been diverted by the battles in the north, then he would have been better prepared to fight William at Hastings and the result might have been different.

<doc id="436511" wikidata="Q2702269" url="?curid=436511" title="Fulford, North Yorkshire">
<text>Fulford is a historic village and civil parish on the outskirts of York, in the York district, in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. Fulford is located to the south of the city, on the east bank of the River Ouse.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 2,785. It is home to Imphal Barracks, headquarters of the British Army&#x27;s 15th Infantry Brigade; soldiers and their families live in married quarters outside the barracks. Fulford is a headquarters for the Royal Military Police.

Fulford was the site of the Battle of Fulford won by the invading Vikings in 1066, a precursor to the nearby Battle of Stamford Bridge lost by the Vikings, and then the Battle of Hastings in Sussex won by the invading Normans in the following weeks.

==History==
St Oswald&#x27;s Hall, the former church, was built about 1150, on a site near the Ouse, west of the current village centre. A new St Oswald&#x27;s Church was built, on a different site, in 1866, and the old church also survives.

Cavalry barracks were established in Fulford as early as 1795 but these have now been largely demolished. The infantry barracks, now known as Imphal Barracks were built between 1877 and 1880.

Fulford Cross, a 15th-century Grade II listed boundary cross stands opposite the barracks, beyond the present parish boundary. The cross has been removed, but an octagonal shaft on a three-stepped pedestal remains.

In 1823 Fulford, known as &quot;Fulford Gate&quot;, was a village in the parish of Fulford Ambo in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the Wapentake of Ouse and Derwent. Population at the time was 182, with occupations including two farmers, two blacksmiths, two wheelwrights, two shoemakers, a butcher, a tailor, a shopkeeper, a coal dealer, a corn miller, and the landlords of The Light Horseman, The Saddle, The Board, The Plough, and The Bay Horse public houses. Also within the village was a druggist, a manufacturing chemist, a schoolmaster, nine gentlemen, three gentlewomen, two bankers and seven yeomen. A school existed for 20 boys and girls. Within the parish of Fulford Ambo, and to the south of Fulford Gate, was the settlement of Fulford Water, with a population of 35 which included three farmers, and a gentleman at the Hall.

The ancient parish of Fulford consisted of two townships, Gate Fulford (also known as Over Fulford) in the north and Water Fulford (also known as Nether Fulford) to the south. From the two townships the parish took the name of Fulfords Ambo in the 19th century. The two townships became separate civil parishes in 1866. In 1900 the civil parish of Gate Fulford was abolished and absorbed into the city of York. The civil parish of Water Fulford was renamed Fulford in 1935.

In 1974 Fulford was transferred from the East Riding of Yorkshire to Selby District in the new county of North Yorkshire. In 1996 the parish was transferred to the City of York unitary authority.

==Geography and governance==

According to the 2001 Census the parish had a population of 2,595. The modern village incorporates the old settlements of Water Fulford to the south and Gate Fulford on the road to York. The current civil parish is co-terminous with the unitary authority ward boundary. The parish is much reduced in size, having once extended north up the A19 past Fulford Barracks as far as Heslington Road and including York Cemetery. Between Fulford and the university is Walmgate Stray. Low-lying land near the River Ouse is prone to flooding.

The parish council maintains a website with local information which includes a directory of organisations and shops, a list of links and contact details for services, a guide to local issues and a record of parish council minutes.
==Education==

Schools in the area include St. Oswald&#x27;s Primary School and Fulford School, a Mathematics and Computing College.

==Transport==
Fulford main street is the A19. Near the intersection stands the York Designer Outlet shopping mall. A pedestrian Millennium Bridge with a cycle path was opened in 2001, linking Fulford to the South Bank area of York on the other side of the river. Several bus services operate between York and Fulford.

==Sport==

Fulford Golf Club, which celebrated its centenary in 2006, was home to the Benson and Hedges International Open between 1971 and 1989. During the 1981 tournament, Bernard Langer climbed up an ash tree by the 17th green to play his third shot. York City F.C. were once based in Fulford, at their Fulfordgate stadium, before moving to the current Bootham Crescent stadium in 1932. The area is now occupied by Eastward Avenue and lies close to Fulford School.

A long scale model of the Solar System starts across the Ouse, west of Fulford, and runs via Naburn to Riccall along a disused railway line from York to Selby, now a Sustrans cycle path and part of the White Rose cycle route.

Besides having the Minster Way and the Wilberforce Way, the route of The White Rose Way, a long-distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough also passes through Fulford.
==Notable people==
*Steve McClaren – former England football manager, was born in Fulford.

<doc id="436512" wikidata="Q3388229" url="?curid=436512" title="Stake (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>A stake is an administrative unit composed of multiple congregations in certain denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. The name &quot;stake&quot; derives from the Book of Isaiah: &quot;enlarge the place of thy tent; stretch forth the curtains of thine habitation; spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes&quot; (Isaiah 54:2). A stake is sometimes referred to as a stake of Zion.

==History==
The first Latter Day Saint stake was organized at church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio, on February 17, 1834, with the movement&#x27;s founder, Joseph Smith, as its president. The second stake was organized further west in Clay County, Missouri, later that year on July 3, 1834, with David Whitmer as president. The Missouri stake was then relocated in 1836 to Far West, Missouri, and the Kirtland Stake in northern Ohio was dissolved in 1838. Another stake was subsequently organized at Adam-ondi-Ahman in 1838 and abandoned later that year due to the events of the Mormon War of 1838 in Missouri. In 1839, the church&#x27;s central stake was re-established further west at Nauvoo, Illinois, near the east bank of the Mississippi River, with William Marks, as president.

Additional stakes were established in the area around Nauvoo in 1840. Immediately after the death of Joseph Smith in Carthage, Illinois in June 1844, there was a succession crisis. In 1846, all of the existing stakes, including the Nauvoo Stake, were discontinued as a result of the exodus of the majority of the Latter Day Saints to the Salt Lake Valley.

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement. After the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, assumed the leadership of the church and led its members westward in wagon and handcart trains across the Mississippi River, the Great Plains, and through the Rocky Mountains to the Salt Lake Valley. The first stake there was the Salt Lake Stake, established October 3, 1847, in the future site of Salt Lake City, with Joseph Smith&#x27;s nephew, John Smith, as president. At the time of church president Young&#x27;s death in 1877, there were 20 LDS Church stakes in operation with approximately 250 wards.

New stakes are created when the congregations in existing stakes or districts have grown sufficiently to support one. When districts become stakes, they no longer presided over by a mission president. New stakes are frequently formed by dividing an existing stake (or by creating three stakes from two existing stakes, etc.). In addition to the size and number of local congregations, the creation of a new stake also requires sufficient Melchizedek priesthood holders to fill required leadership positions. At times the absence of available leadership constrains the creation of new stakes and the number of congregations within a stake can be much larger than normal. The geographical area encompassed by a stake varies between countries and regions based on membership density. In Utah, a stake might encompass a few square miles in area. In contrast, a stake in another part of the world might require thousands of square miles to comprise a sufficient number of members.

In December 2012, Jeffrey R. Holland organized the church&#x27;s 3,000th stake in Freetown, Sierra Leone in West Africa. At the end of 2015, there were 3,174 stakes in the LDS Church. As of December 31, 2019, the LDS Church reported 3,437 stakes.

===Stake organization===
The stake is an intermediate level in the organizational hierarchy of the LDS Church. The lowest level, consisting of a single congregation, is known as a ward or branch. Stakes are organized from a group of contiguous wards or branches. To be created, a stake must be composed of at least five wards. A stake may have up to a total of 16 congregations. Most stakes are composed of five to ten wards. In the United States and Canada, a minimum of 3,000 members is required to create a stake; elsewhere, a minimum of 1,900 members is required. For a stake to be created, there must be at least 99 active, full-tithe-paying Melchizedek priesthood holders living in the stake boundaries. In late 2023, the First Presidency announced standardized requirements for becoming a ward which took effect in 2024.

Stakes may be compared to dioceses in other episcopal Christian denominations.

====Stake officers====
The presiding officer in a stake is known as the stake president. The president is assisted by two counselors and the three together form a &quot;stake presidency.&quot; The stake presidency is assisted in turn by a twelve-member body, called the stake high council. The members of the stake presidency and stake high council hold the priesthood office of high priest. The stake presidency and the high council handle the administrative and judicial business of the stake. The three members of the stake presidency are given the honorific title &quot;president&quot;.

In an area where there are insufficient congregations to form a stake, a district is formed to oversee the congregations. The presiding officer in a district is called the district president. The district president may or may not have counselors, depending on the number of members in the district. A district council of up to twelve individuals may also be formed. Duties which would be carried out by a stake presidency within a stake are shared between the district presidency and the mission presidency in a district.

In addition to the presidency and high council, &quot;stake organization leaders&quot; are called to oversee the operation of the stake&#x27;s various organizations. These correspond to those at the ward level, and include the Relief Society, Primary, Young Men, Young Women, and Sunday School organizations. Typically, the stake-level auxiliary leadership consists of a presidency (made up of a president and two counselors), a secretary, and perhaps additional assistants or board members with specific responsibilities within the organization. The stake organization leaders provide oversight, advice, and counsel for the ward-level leaders and organize stake-wide activities. Other stake specialists may be called to organize activities—typically sports or drama programs—which are more suitable for the larger numbers of people available to a stake and might be difficult for a ward to carry out on its own. Stake organization leaders, especially in the Young Men and Young Women organizations, may also coordinate activities with other stakes in the general area. This is especially common of youth dances, and occasionally of youth conferences.

All stake leaders are lay members who serve without remuneration. Today, stake presidents generally serve for seven to eleven years. In the past, lengths of tenure have varied, with some stake presidents serving for many decades.

====Stake conference====
Each stake will hold a stake conference twice a year under the direction of the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The stake president presides at these conferences, unless a general authority or area seventy is assigned to the conference. The stake president is responsible for organizing the conferences or assist in doing so under the direction of the general authority or area seventy as directed. The conferences are used to conduct stake business (primarily the appointment and sustaining of stake officers) and to disseminate counsel and guidance from the stake presidency. Speakers at stake conferences generally include the three members of the stake presidency and other stake members, invited by the stake presidency to speak on assigned topics. When a general authority or area seventy presides, he is the featured speaker.

The general session (for all stake members) is usually held on Sunday. This may be held in a local tabernacle if available. If held in the stake center, the general session may be divided into multiple sessions, so that all stake members may be accommodated in the building. A session for all adult members is generally held on the preceding Saturday evening. A priesthood leadership session is also held in conjunction with a stake conference. Some stakes are geographically large enough that multiple sessions of stake conference may held at different locations to accommodate those who live in distant areas.

A multi-site stake conference has become more common in the current structure. As the number of stakes continued to grow, it became more difficult for general authorities to visit stake conferences, even on a semi-regular basis. Area and regional conferences had been organized attempts to counteract this situation. A format has developed in the church such that groups of stakes are designated to receive a satellite broadcast from Salt Lake City. Using the recording studio at the Conference Center, general authorities deliver sermons that are broadcast to each designated stake. Each stake conducts its own opening hymns and prayers and conducts its own business before the broadcast begins. Another advantage of this format is that in stakes that are geographically large it is easier to hold stake conference in more than one location.

===Stake center===

In each stake, one of the meetinghouses is designated the stake center. This building is usually the largest meetinghouse in the stake, but where stakes are large in area the stake center may be chosen because it is more centrally-located in the boundaries of the stake. The stake center is where functions of the stake such as stake conferences, stake meetings, and stake activities are usually held. There are usually offices for conducting stake business in the stake center. During the mid-to-late 19th and early-20th century, in areas with larger LDS populations, stake tabernacles were used for most of the larger activities now performed at stake centers, while the stake offices were located in what was known as a stake house. In areas with fewer members and no stake tabernacle, a stake house was used like a modern stake center for both meetings and offices.

===Districts===

A church district is a geographical, administrative unit composed of a number of congregations called branches. A district is a subdivision of a mission of the church and in many ways is analogous to a church stake. The leader of a district is the mission president, who selects a local district president as his agent. The district president may choose two men to assist him; the three together form the district presidency.

==Community of Christ==
The Community of Christ (previously the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) eliminated the designation of &quot;stake&quot; as an administrative unit. The church is now organized into &quot;mission centers&quot;.

==Strangites==
Historically, the Strangites maintained stakes in Voree, Wisconsin; Kirtland, Ohio; and on Beaver Island, Michigan, but today the church has only a single stake in Voree.

<text>Laurent Cassegrain (; – 1 September 1693) was a Catholic priest who is notable as the probable inventor of the Cassegrain reflector, a folded two-mirror reflecting telescope design.

==Biography==
Laurent Cassegrain was born in the region of Chartres around 1629 and was the son of Mathurin Cassegrain and Jehanne Marquet. It is unknown what his education was but he was a priest and professor by 1654. He may have been interested in acoustics, optics and mechanics. At the time of his death he was working as a teacher giving science classes at the Collège de Chartres, a French lycée, i.e., a high-school like institution. He died at Chaudon (Eure-et-Loir) on 1 September 1693.

==Connection with the Cassegrain reflector==

The Cassegrain reflector is a reflecting telescope design that solved the problem of viewing an image without obstructing the primary mirror by using a convex secondary mirror on the optical axis to bounce the light back through a hole in the primary mirror thus permitting the light to reach an eyepiece.

It first appeared in the eighth edition of the 17th-century French science journal &quot;Recueil des mémoires et conférences concernant les arts et les sciences&quot;, published by Jean-Baptiste Denys on 25 April 1672. In that edition is found an extract from a letter written by M. de Bercé, writing from Chartres, where he acted as a representative for the Académie des sciences —scholars of Chartres. M. de Bercé reported on a man named &quot;Cassegrain&quot; who had written a letter on the megaphone with an attached note describing a new type of reflecting telescope, the &quot;Cassegrain reflector&quot;, where a secondary convex mirror is suspended above a primary concave mirror. This was around the time of the publication of the construction of the first practical reflecting telescope, Isaac Newton&#x27;s Newtonian reflector. On 13 June 1672 Christiaan Huygens wrote about the Cassegrain design and critiqued it harshly, maybe because Huygens felt Newton&#x27;s design was being &quot;imperilled&quot; by this alternative. Whatever the motives, the storm of controversy that followed had one lasting effect: Cassegrain&#x27;s name was forgotten.

The identity of this &quot;Cassegrain&quot; has had many theories. His only known publication was the letter on the megaphone/reflecting telescope in the 25 April 1672 &quot;Recueil des mémoires et conférences concernant les arts et les sciences&quot;. For a long time, reference works were forced to report his first name as &quot;not conclusively known&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (15th edition, 1974), for example, only goes as far as listing &quot;Cassegrain, N.&quot; (this, in turn, seems to come from Ferdinand Hoefer&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle biographie générale&quot;, Paris, 1855). Other sources have suggested the &quot;N.&quot; stood for Nicolas. Some sources (such as &quot;La grande encyclopédie&quot;, 9, 696) claim his name to be Guillaume, a metal-caster and sculptor who is mentioned in the accounts of king Louis XIV&#x27;s buildings between 1684 and 1686, and also in a Paris notarized act from 1693. Another name put forward is Jacques, a chirurgeon (i.e., surgeon) mentioned in the &quot;Mémoires de l’Académie des sciences&quot; as having found, in 1691, a piece of magnet in the steeple of Chartres Cathedral, then being repaired after being damaged by inclement weather.

In 1997 two French astronomers, André Baranne and Françoise Launay, after a long and meticulous investigation including a search for unpublished manuscripts and the analysis of parish registers in the places where Cassegrain lived (Chartres first and then Chaudon, near Nogent-le-Roi), identified &quot;Laurent Cassegrain&quot; as the most likely candidate.

The crater Cassegrain on the Moon is named after him, even though his true identity was not known at the time of the naming.

<doc id="436518" wikidata="Q262629" url="?curid=436518" title="Vega (rocket)">
<text>Vega (, , ) was an expendable small-lift launch vehicle operated by Arianespace, produced by Avio, and jointly developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Development began in 1998 and the first launch took place from the Guiana Space Centre on 13February 2012. It was the 8th most launched small lift launch vehicle in history. The final flight of the rocket took place on 5September 2024, after being replaced by the improved Vega C, already in use since 2022.

It was designed to launch small payloads, satellites for scientific and Earth observation missions to polar and low Earth orbits. The reference Vega mission was a polar orbit bringing a spacecraft of to an altitude of .

The rocket, named after Vega, the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, was a single-body launcher (no strap-on boosters) with three solid rocket stages: the P80 first stage, the Zefiro 23 second stage, and the Zefiro 9 third stage. The upper module was a liquid rocket called AVUM. The improved version of the P80 stage, the P120C, will also be used as the side boosters of the Ariane 6. Italy was the leading contributor to the Vega program (65%), followed by France (13%). Other participants include Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.

Vega struggled to compete in the commercial launch market in its decade of service. After initial success, two in-flight failures and rising competition SpaceX&#x27;s rideshare programs, which offered lower prices, relegated Vega to primarily serving European government agencies willing to pay more to support independent space access.

== Development ==
=== Background ===
During the mid-1990s, French firms Aérospatiale and SEP, along with Italian firm Bombrini-Parodi-Delfino (BPD), commenced discussions on the development of a proposed Ariane Complementary Launcher (ACL). Around the same time, Italy began to champion the concept of a new solid-propellant satellite launcher. This proposed launcher, dubbed &quot;Vega&quot;, was promoted as functioning to expand the range of European launch capabilities; Vega would be capable of launching a 1000 kg payload into a 700 km polar orbit. From the onset, the first of three stages would be based on the solid booster of the existing Ariane 5 expendable launch system while the second and third stages would make use of the in-development Zefiro rocket motor.

However, it was recognised to be a costly project and thus difficult for Italy alone to finance; accordingly, international partners were sought early on in order to proceed with development. In April 1998, it was publicly stated that the Vega programme was dependent upon the securing of roughly ECU70 million of industrial investment, as well as the availability of around ECU350 million of funding that had been requested from interested member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), led by France and Italy. During June 1998, it was announced that ministers from European Space Agency (ESA) member states had agreed to proceed with the first phase of the development programme for Vega; the participating members were France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy – the latter had assumed 55% of the burden for financing the programme.

By September 1998, it was projected that, if fully funded, Vega would perform its first launch during 2002. However, by early 1998, France was publicly showing displeasure in the programme, leading to disputes in its funding. A new, higher-performance version of the Vega was proposed, but this failed to sufficiently satisfy France. In September 1999, France decided to withdraw from the Vega programme entirely, leading to fears for the future of the launcher. In November 1999, European Space Agency (ESA) formally dropped Vega as an endorsed programme, a decision which was largely attributed to France&#x27;s withdrawal; Italy declared that it would proceed regardless, and threatened to re-direct its allocated contributions for the further development of the Ariane 5 to meet the shortfall.

Around 2000, an alternative use for the Vega was explored as a medium-class booster rocket to be used in conjunction with an improved, up-rated model of the Ariane 5 heavy launcher. In October 2000, it was announced that France and Italy had settled their year-long dispute over the Vega programme; France and Italy agreed to provide 35% and 52%, respectively, of the financing towards the all-composite P80 booster for the Ariane 5 — work which would be included in the Vega programme. In March 2001, FiatAvio and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) formed a new company, European Launch Vehicle (ELV), to assume responsibility for the majority of development work on the Vega programme. By 2003, there was concerns that European Space Agency (ESA)&#x27;s recent adoption of the Russian Soyuz launcher would directly compete with the in-development Vega; demands for such launchers had declined with a downturn in the mobile telecommunications satellite market and doubts over the European Galileo satellite navigation system.

=== Programme launch ===
In March 2003, contracts for development of the Vega launcher were signed by European Space Agency (ESA) and Centre national d&#x27;études spatiales (CNES), the French space agency; Italy provided 65% of funding while six additional nations contributed the remainder. In May 2004, it was reported that a contract was signed between commercial operator Arianespace and prime contractor ELV to perform vehicle integration at Kourou, French Guiana. In November 2004, construction commenced upon a new dedicated launch pad for the Vega launcher at Kourou, this included a bunker and a self-propelled structure to assist assembly of the stages; this site was built over the original launch pad for the retired Ariane 1 launcher. In September 2005, the successful completion of key tests on the Vega&#x27;s solid rocket motor igniters, a key milestone, was reported.

In November 2005, European Space Agency (ESA) declared its desire for the development and deployment of an electric propulsion-powered module to work in conjunction with the Vega launcher; this envisioned module would transfer payloads between low Earth orbit (LEO) and a geostationary orbit (GEO). During November 2005, it was reported that both Israel and India had shown formal interest in the Vega programme. In December 2005, the Vega launcher, along with the Ariane and Soyuz launchers, were endorsed as the recognised &quot;first choice&quot; platforms for ESA payloads. On 19 December 2005, the first test firing of the Vega&#x27;s third stage was completed successfully at Salto di Quirra, Sardinia. For several years, further tests would be conducted at the Sardinia site. Progress on Vega was delayed by the failure of one such test of the third stage on 28 March 2007.

During January 2007, European Space Agency (ESA) announced that the agency was studying the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation in order to support launches of the Vega and Ariane. At the 2009 Paris Air Show, it was revealed that the adoption of more cost-effective engine to replace the upper stages of the Vega have been postponed due to a failure to reduce the overall costs of the launcher, making it much less worthwhile to pursue. Despite this finding, efforts to improve the efficiency of the third stage continued. At this point, the certification of all four stages of the Vega launch was anticipated to be achieved prior to the end of 2009, while the first launch was scheduled to take place during 2010. The first flight was intended to be flown with a scientific payload, rather than a &quot;dummy&quot; placeholder; but had intentionally avoided a costly commercial satellite. By late 2010, the first flight had been delayed into 2011.

=== Into flight ===
During October 2011, all major components of the first Vega rocket departed Avio&#x27;s Colleferro facility, near Rome, by sea for Kourou. At this point, the first launch was anticipated to occur during December 2011 or January 2012. During early January 2012, it was reported that the launch date would slip into the following month. On 13 February 2012, the first launch of the Vega rocket occurred for Kourou; it was reported as being an &quot;apparently perfect flight&quot;.

During mid-2011, it was postulated that an evolved &#x27;Europeanised&#x27; upgrade of the Vega rocket could be developed in the medium-to-long term future. Following the successful first launch, various improvements for the Vega were postulated. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) was reportedly enthusiastic on the prospects of developing a European alternative to the Vega&#x27;s final, fourth stage; however, it was widely believed that there should be no change to Vega hardware for roughly 10 years in order to consolidate operations and avoid unnecessary costs early on. European Space Agency (ESA) was also keen to take advantage of potential commonalities between the Vega and the proposed Ariane 6 heavy launcher.

Following on from the first launch, a further four flights were conducted under the vestiges of the VERTA programme (Vega Research and Technology Accompaniment), during which observation or scientific payloads were orbited while validating and readying the Vega rocket for more lucrative commercial operations. The second launch, performed on 6 May 2013, which followed a considerably more demanding flight profile and carried the type&#x27;s first commercial payload, was also successful. In the aftermath of this second launch, European Space Agency (ESA) declared the Vega rocket to be &quot;fully functional&quot;. The lapse of more than one year between the inaugural flight and the second one was mainly due to the fact that the Italian manufacturer had to completely redevelop the Flight Control Software, due to the restrictions on French export control imposed on the software used on the first flight.

Since entering commercial service, Arianespace markets Vega as a launch system tailored for missions to polar and Sun-synchronous orbits. During its qualification flight, Vega placed its main payload of 386.8 kg, the LARES satellite, into a circular orbit at the altitude of 1450 km with an inclination of 69.5°.

=== Technical specifications ===

=== Payload ===
Arianespace had indicated that the Vega launcher was able to carry to a circular polar orbit at an altitude of .

The payload fairing of the Vega was designed and was manufactured by RUAG Space of Switzerland. It has a diameter of 2.6 metres, a height of 7.8 metres and a mass of 400 kg. The cylindrical part of the fairing has an outer diameter 2.6 m and a height 3.5 m.

=== Three solid motor stages ===
The first three stages are solid propellant engines produced by Avio, that was the prime contractor for the Vega launcher through its company ELV.

, the design and production process of the three engine types intended for the three stages of Vega were planned to be verified in two ground-test firings — one for design evaluation and one in the final flight configuration.

==== P80 ====
The P80 was the first stage of VEGA, its name was derived from the design phase propellant weight of 80 tons that was later increased to 88 tons. The P80 includes a thrust vector control (TVC) system, developed and made in Belgium by SABCA, consisting of two electromechanical actuators that operate a movable nozzle with flexible joint using lithium-ion batteries. The 3 m diameter case was composed of graphite epoxy filament wound case and low density rubber was used for the internal insulation. The nozzle was made of light low-cost carbon phenolic material; a consumable casing was used for the igniter. The solid propellant loaded has low binder content and high aluminium percentage (HTPB 1912).

The first test firing of the P80 engine took place on 30 November 2006 in Kourou, and the test was concluded successfully.

The second test firing of the P80 first stage engine took place on 4 December 2007 in Kourou. Delivering a mean thrust of 190 tonnes over 111 seconds, the engine&#x27;s behaviour was in line with predictions.

The future version of the stage, P120C, also with its name derived from the design phase propellant weight of 120 tons, will increase the propellant mass to 141–143 tons.

==== Zefiro 23 ====

The development of the Zefiro motor was initiated by Avio, partially funded by the company and partially funded by a contract from the Italian Space Agency (ISA). A Zefiro 23 forms the second stage of Vega. Its carbon-epoxy case was filament-wound and its carbon phenolic nozzle includes a carbon-carbon throat insert. The propellant loading was 23 tons.

The Zefiro 23 second stage engine was first fired on 26 June 2006 at Salto di Quirra. This test was successful.

The second test firing of the Zefiro 23 second stage engine took place on 27 March 2008 also at Salto di Quirra. This successful test qualified the rocket engine.

==== Zefiro 9 ====
The first engine completed was Zefiro 9, the third-stage engine. The first test firing was carried out on 20 December 2005, at the Salto di Quirra Inter-force Test Range, on the Mediterranean coast in southeast Sardinia. The test was a complete success.

After a critical design review based on the completed first test firings, the second test-firing of the Zefiro 9 took place at Salto di Quirra on 28 March 2007. After 35 seconds, there was a sudden drop in the motor&#x27;s internal pressure, leading to an increased combustion time. No public information was available for this sudden drop of internal pressure, and whether any flaws were present in the motor&#x27;s design.

On 23 October 2008, an enhanced version of the Zefiro 9 with a modified nozzle design, the Zefiro 9-A, was successfully tested.

On 28 April 2009, the final qualification test firing of Zefiro 9-A took place at the Salto di Quirra Interforce Test Range in Sardinia, Italy.

=== Attitude &amp; Vernier Upper Module (AVUM) ===
The Attitude &amp; Vernier Upper Module (AVUM), developed by Avio, serves as the upper stage (fourth stage) of the Vega rocket, designed to place payloads into precise orbits while performing roll and attitude control functions. It is composed of two main components: the AVUM Propulsion Module (APM) and the AVUM Avionics Module (AAM). The APM is powered by the Ukrainian-built RD-843 rocket engine, a lightweight, pressure-fed liquid-fuel system that uses unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide () oxidizer as propellants. This engine is capable of multiple restarts, enabling high-precision orbital adjustments, multi-payload deployment, and controlled de-orbiting to reduce space debris. The AAM houses the vehicle’s core avionics subsystem, integrating advanced guidance, navigation, and control systems.

== Variants ==
There was a concept study for a new medium-size launcher based on Vega and Ariane 5 elements. This launcher would use an Ariane 5 P230 first stage, a Vega P80 second stage and an Ariane 5 third stage using either storable or cryogenic fuel.

The future upgraded Vega (&quot;LYRA program&quot;) has exceeded the feasibility study and was planned to replace the current third and fourth stages with a single low cost LOX/Liquid methane stage with a new guidance system. The purpose of the program was to upgrade the performance by about 30% without significant price increase.

On 14 February 2012, one day after the successful first launch of Vega, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) moved to be included in the program. Johann-Dietrich Wörner, at that time head of DLR, said Germany wanted to join the project. Germany would provide a replacement for the RD-843 engine on the AVUM fourth stage, currently made in Ukraine. The Vega launcher manager stated that it will not fly in the near future because it takes some time to develop, but he confirmed it will be on agenda in the next meeting of ministers in late 2012. That way, all components of the rocket would be built inside the European Union (EU), excluding the Swiss made ones.

The revised Vega-C first stage, renamed &quot;P120C&quot; (Common), has been selected as booster for the first stage of the next generation Ariane 6 rocket at European Space Agency (ESA) Council meeting at Ministerial level in December 2014.

Avio was also considering a &quot;Vega Light&quot; that would omit the first stage of either the Vega-C or Vega-E and would be targeted at replenishing satellite constellations. The vehicle would be capable of launching between 250–300 kg or 400–500 kg depending on whether it was derived from a Vega-C or Vega-E, respectively.

=== Vega C ===

Vega C was an evolution on the original Vega launcher to enable better launch performance and flexibility. Development started following the December 2014 ESA Ministerial Council with the goal to meet the change in payload demands, both in regards to an increase in medium-sized institutional payloads, and to compete with cheaper launch providers.

This new evolution incorporates various changes to the Vega stack. The first stage P80 motor will be replaced with the P120C, the same booster due to be used on the Ariane 6 launcher, and the Zefiro 23 second stage will also be replaced with the Zefiro 40. The larger AVUM+ will replace the AVUM fourth stage, while the third Zefiro 9 stage will be carried over from the base version of the launcher.

These modifications will enable new mission parameters using various payload adapters and upper stages. The new rocket will be able to carry dual payloads using the Vespa-C payload adapter, or a single large satellite in addition to smaller payloads using the Vampire and SMSS multiple payload dispenser. Orbital transfer capability was also available with the Vega Electrical Nudge Upper Stage, or VENUS.

Return missions are also available using the reusable Space Rider vehicle, currently in development by ESA and due to launch on a Vega-C no earlier than July 2025.

On 13 July 2022, Vega-C had its debut flight, during which it delivered the LARES 2 and six other satellites to orbit. This launch came as a way of filling the gap after the Russian rockets became unavailable due to the invasion of Ukraine. On 21 December 2022 (UTC), Vega-C suffered a launch failure due to an anomaly with the Zefiro 40 second stage resulting in the loss of two spacecraft for the Airbus Pléiades Neo Earth-imaging constellation.

Following the failure, the next launch was delayed until late 2024 to allow the redesign of a rocket motor nozzle.

=== Vega-E ===

The Vega E (or Vega Evolution) is a further evolution of the Vega-C. The first stage P120C motor will be replaced with the P160C, the same booster due to be used on the Ariane 6 Block 2 launcher.

The Zefiro 9 and AVUM+ third and fourth stages will be replaced with a cryogenic upper stage powered by liquid oxygen and liquid methane. This variant offers even more flexibility than Vega-C, with the ability to deliver multiple satellites into different orbits on a single launch.

 Avio was finalizing the development of the new M10 methane engine used in the new upper stage. The engine design was the result of a collaboration between Avio and Chemical Automatics Design Bureau (KBKhA) ended in 2014.

Avio successfully conducted the first series of testing of the M10 engine between May and July 2022 with the maiden flight of the Vega-E planned for 2027.

== Costs ==
Development costs for the Vega rocket totaled €710 million, with ESA spending an additional €400 million to sponsor five development flights between 2012 and 2014. Estimates of commercial launch costs in 2012 were projected to be €32 million, including Arianespace&#x27;s marketing and service costs, or €25 million for each rocket alone, assuming a launch rate of 2 per year. 
In 2012, the managing director of ELV estimated that if the sustained flight rate were to increase to four flights per year, the price of each individual launch vehicle could potentially decrease to €22 million. 

In the event, by November 2020, Vega had never flown more than three flights in a single year, with an average flight rate of just under two launches per year.

<text>Cycloplegia is paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye, resulting in a loss of accommodation. Because of the paralysis of the ciliary muscle, the curvature of the lens can no longer be adjusted to focus on nearby objects. This results in similar problems as those caused by presbyopia, in which the lens has lost elasticity and can also no longer focus on close-by objects. Cycloplegia with accompanying mydriasis (dilation of pupil) is usually due to topical application of muscarinic antagonists such as atropine and cyclopentolate.

Belladonna alkaloids are used for testing the error of refraction and examination of eye.

==Management==
Cycloplegic drugs are generally muscarinic receptor antagonists such as atropine, cyclopentolate, homatropine, scopolamine and tropicamide. They are indicated for use in cycloplegic refraction (to paralyze the ciliary muscle in order to determine the true refractive error of the eye) and the treatment of uveitis. All cycloplegics are also mydriatic (pupil dilating) agents and are used as such during eye examination to better visualize the retina.

When cycloplegic drugs are used as a mydriatic to dilate the pupil, the pupil in the normal eye regains its function when the drugs are metabolized or carried away. Some cycloplegic drugs can cause dilation of the pupil for several days. The ones specifically used by ophthalmologists or optometrists wear off in hours, but when the patient leaves the office strong sunglasses are provided for comfort.

<doc id="436522" wikidata="Q1630727" url="?curid=436522" title="Hot rod">
<text>Hot rods are typically American cars that might be old, classic, or modern and that have been rebuilt or modified with large engines optimized for speed and acceleration. One definition is: &quot;a car that&#x27;s been stripped down, souped up and made to go much faster.&quot; However, there is no definition of the term that is universally accepted and the term is attached to a wide range of vehicles. Most often they are individually designed and constructed using components from many makes of old or new cars, and are most prevalent in the United States and Canada. Many are intended for exhibition rather than for racing or everyday driving.

The origin of the term &quot;hot rod&quot; is unclear. Some say that the term &quot;hot&quot; refers to the vehicle&#x27;s being stolen. Other origin stories include replacing the engine&#x27;s camshaft or &quot;rod&quot; with a higher performance version. According to the Hot Rod Industry Alliance (HRIA), the term changes in meaning over the years, but &quot;hot rodding has less to do with the vehicle and more to do with an attitude and lifestyle&quot;. For example, hot rods were favorites for greasers.

The term has broadened to apply to other items that are modified for a particular purpose, such as &quot;hot-rodded amplifier&quot;.

== Etymology ==
There are various theories about the origin of the term &quot;hot rod&quot;. The common theme is that &quot;hot&quot; related to &quot;hotting up&quot; a car, which means modifying it for greater performance. With regards to the word &quot;rod&quot;, one theory is that it means roadster, a lightweight 2-door car which was often used as the basis for early hot rods. Another theory is that &quot;rod&quot; refers to camshaft, a part of the engine which was often upgraded in order to increase power output.

In the early days, a car modified for increased performance was called a &quot;gow job&quot;. This term morphed into the hot rod in the early to late 1940s.

The term &quot;hot rod&quot; has had various uses in relation to performance cars. For example, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment in its vehicle emissions regulations refers to a hot rod as any motorized vehicle that has a replacement engine differing from the factory original.

==History==
=== 1920s to 1945 ===
The forerunners to the hotrod were the modified cars used in the Prohibition era by bootleggers to evade revenue agents and other law enforcement.

Hot rods first appeared in the late 1930s in southern California, where people raced modified cars on dry lake beds northeast of Los Angeles, under the rules of the Southern California Timing Association (SCTA), among other groups. This gained popularity after World War II, particularly in California, because many returning soldiers had received technical training. The first hot rods were old cars (most often Fords, typically 1910s-1920s Model Ts, 1928–31 Model As, or 1932-34 Model Bs), modified to reduce weight. Engine swaps often involved fitting the Ford flathead V8 engine (known as the &quot;flatty&quot;) into a different car, for example, the common practice in the 1940s of installing the &quot;60 horse&quot; version into a Jeep chassis.

Typical modifications were removal of convertible tops, hoods, bumpers, windshields, and/or fenders; channeling the body; and modifying the engine by tuning and/or replacing with a more powerful type. Wheels and tires were changed for improved traction and handling. Hot rods built before 1945 commonly used &#x27;35 Ford wire-spoke wheels.

=== 1945 to 1960 ===

After World War II, many small military airports throughout the country were either abandoned or rarely used, allowing hot rodders across the country to race on marked courses. Originally, drag racing had tracks as long as or more, and included up to four lanes of racing simultaneously. As some hot rodders also raced on the street, a need arose for an organization to promote safety, and to provide venues for safe racing. The National Hot Rod Association was founded in 1951, to take drag racing off the streets and into controlled environments.

In the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, the Ford flathead V8 was supplanted by the Chrysler FirePower engine (known as the &quot;early hemi&quot;). Many hot rods would upgrade the brakes from mechanical to hydraulic (&quot;juice&quot;) and headlights from bulb to sealed-beam. A typical mid-1950s to early 1960s custom Deuce was fenderless and steeply chopped, powered by a Ford or Mercury flathead, with an Edelbrock intake manifold, Harman and Collins magneto, and Halibrand quick-change differential. Front suspension hairpins were adapted from sprint cars, such as the Kurtis Krafts.

As hot rodding became more popular, magazines and associations catering to hot rodders were started, such as the magazine &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, founded in 1948.

=== 1960 to present ===

As automobiles offered by the major automakers began increasing performance, the lure of hot rods began to wane. With the advent of the muscle car, it was now possible to purchase a high-performance car straight from the showroom.

However, the 1973 Oil Crisis caused car manufacturers to focus on fuel efficiency over performance, which led to a resurgence of interest in hot rodding. As the focus shifted away from racing, the modified cars became known as &quot;street rods&quot;. The National Street Rod Association (NSRA) was formed and began hosting events.

By the 1970s, the small-block Chevy V8 was the most common choice of engine for hot rods. Another popular engine choice is the Ford Windsor engine. During the 1980s, many car manufacturers were reducing the displacements of their engines, thus making it harder for hot rod builders to obtain large displacement engines. Instead, engine builders had to modify the smaller engines (such as using non-standard crankshafts and pistons) to obtain larger displacement. While current production V8s tended to be the most frequent candidates, this also applied to others. In the mid-1980s, as stock engine sizes diminished, rodders discovered the aluminum-block Buick or Oldsmobile V8 could be modified for substantially greater displacement, with mainly wrecking yard parts. This trend was not limited to American cars; Volkswagen enthusiasts similarly stretched stock 1600cc engines to over two liters.

==In modern culture==
The hot rod community has now been subdivided into two main groups: street rodders and hot rodders.

===Lifestyle===

There is a contemporary movement of traditional hot rod builders, car clubs and artists who have returned to the roots of hot rodding as a lifestyle. This includes a new breed of traditional hot rod builders, artists, and styles, as well as classic style car clubs. Events like GreaseOrama feature traditional hot rods and the greaser lifestyle. Magazines like &quot;Ol&#x27; Skool Rodz&quot;, &quot;Gears and Gals&quot;, and &quot;Rat-Rods and Rust Queens&quot; cover events and people.

===In popular culture===

There are magazines that feature traditional hot rods, including &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, &quot;Car Craft&quot;, &quot;Rod and Custom&quot;, and &quot;Popular Hot Rodding&quot;. There are also television shows such as &quot;My Classic Car&quot;, &quot;Horsepower TV&quot;, &quot;American Hot Rod&quot;,&quot; Fast and Loud&quot;, and &quot;Chop Cut Rebuild&quot;.

Particularly during the early 1960s, a genre of &quot;hot rod music&quot; rose to mainstream popularity. Hot rod music was largely a product of a number of surf music groups running out of ideas for new surfing songs and simultaneously shifting their lyrical focus toward hot rods. Hot rod music would prove to be the second phase in a progression known as the California Sound, which would mature into more complex topics as the decade passed. Hot rods were used as the theme of Lightning Rod, a Rocky Mountain Construction roller coaster at Dollywood.

===In Sweden and Finland===
Locals in Sweden and Finland, influenced by American culture, have created a vibrant local hot rod culture where enthusiasts gather at meetings such as Power Big Meet in Linköping and clubs like Wheels and Wings in Varberg, both located in Sweden. Since there is very little &quot;vintage tin&quot;, the hot rods in Sweden are generally made with a home-made chassis (usually a Model T or A replica), with a Jaguar (or Volvo 240) rear axle, a small-block V8, and fiberglass tub, but some have been built using for instance a Volvo Duett chassis. Because Swedish regulations required a crash test even for custom-built passenger cars between 1969 and 1982, the Duett option was preferred, since it was considered a rebodied Duett rather than a new vehicle. Some 1950s and 1960s, cars are also hot rodded, like Morris Minor, Ford Anglia, Volvo Amazon, Ford Cortina, and &#x27;57 Chevy, to name but a few. These are known as custom cars (sometimes spelled Kustom).
