<text>Francis Parkman Jr. (September 16, 1823 – November 8, 1893) was an American historian, best known as author of &quot;The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life&quot; and his monumental seven-volume &quot;France and England in North America.&quot; These works are still valued as historical sources and as literature. He was also a leading horticulturist, briefly a professor of horticulture at Harvard University and author of several books on the topic. Parkman wrote essays opposed to legal voting for women that continued to circulate long after his death. Parkman was a trustee of the Boston Athenæum from 1858 until his death in 1893.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Parkman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to the Reverend Francis Parkman Sr. (1788–1853), a member of a distinguished Boston family, and Caroline (Hall) Parkman. The senior Parkman was minister of the Unitarian New North Church in Boston from 1813 to 1849.

As a young boy, &quot;Frank&quot; Parkman was found to be of poor health, and was sent to live with his maternal grandfather, who owned a 3,000-acre (12 km2) tract of wilderness in nearby Medford, Massachusetts, in the hopes that a more rustic lifestyle would make him more sturdy. In the four years he stayed there, Parkman developed his love of the forests, which would animate his historical research. Indeed, he would later summarize his books as &quot;the history of the American forest.&quot; He learned how to hunt, and could survive in the wilderness like a true pioneer. He later even learned to ride bareback, a skill that would come in handy when he found himself living with the Sioux.

===Education and career===
Parkman enrolled at Harvard College at age 16. In his second year he conceived the plan that would become his life&#x27;s work. In 1843, at the age of 20, he traveled to Europe for eight months in the fashion of the Grand Tour. Parkman made expeditions through the Alps and the Apennine Mountains, climbed Vesuvius, and lived for a time in Rome, where he befriended Passionist monks who tried, unsuccessfully, to convert him to Catholicism.

Upon graduation in 1844, he was persuaded to get a law degree, his father hoping such study would rid Parkman of his desire to write his history of the forests. It did no such thing, and after finishing law school Parkman proceeded to fulfill his great plan. His family was somewhat appalled at Parkman&#x27;s choice of life work, since at the time writing histories of the American wilderness was considered ungentlemanly. Serious historians would study ancient history, or after the fashion of the time, the Spanish Empire. Parkman&#x27;s works became so well-received that by the end of his lifetime histories of early America had become the fashion. Theodore Roosevelt dedicated his four-volume history of the frontier, &quot;The Winning of the West&quot; (1889–1896), to Parkman.

In 1846, Parkman travelled west on a hunting expedition, where he spent a number of weeks living with the Sioux tribe, at a time when they were struggling with some of the effects of contact with Europeans, such as epidemic disease and alcoholism. This experience led Parkman to write about American Indians with a much different tone from earlier, more sympathetic portrayals represented by the &quot;noble savage&quot; stereotype. Writing in the era of manifest destiny, Parkman believed that the conquest and displacement of American Indians represented progress, a triumph of &quot;civilization&quot; over &quot;savagery&quot;, a common view at the time. He wrote &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; during his 1846–1848 convalescence from illness in Staten Island, New York and Brattleboro, Vermont. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855, and in 1865 was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

With the Civil War concluding, Parkman, along with Boston Athenæum librarian William F. Poole and fellow trustees Donald McKay Frost and Raymond Sanger Wilkins, saw the importance of securing, for the benefit of future historians, newspapers, broadsides, books, and pamphlets printed in the Confederate States of America. Thanks to Parkman&#x27;s foresight, the Boston Athenæum is home to one of the most extensive collections of Confederate imprints in the world.

Parkman wrote a widely circulated 1879 propaganda essay against women&#x27;s suffrage in which he expressed the view that women are &quot;the impulsive and excitable half of humanity&quot; who could not be trusted in government.

===Personal life===
A scion of a wealthy Boston family, Parkman had enough money to pursue his research without having to worry too much about finances. His financial stability was enhanced by his modest lifestyle, and later, by the royalties from his book sales. He was thus able to commit much of his time to research, as well as to travel. He traveled across North America, visiting most of the historical locations he wrote about, and made frequent trips to Europe seeking original documents with which to further his research.

Parkman&#x27;s accomplishments are all the more impressive in light of the fact that he suffered from a debilitating neurological illness, which plagued him his entire life, and which was never properly diagnosed. He was often unable to walk, and for long periods he was effectively blind, being unable to see but the slightest amount of light. Much of his research involved having people read documents to him, and much of his writing was written in the dark, or dictated to others.
Parkman married Catherine Scollay Bigelow on May 13, 1850; they had three children. A son died in childhood, and shortly afterwards, his wife died. He successfully raised two daughters, introducing them into Boston society and seeing them both wed, with families of their own. Parkman died at age 70 in Jamaica Plain. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Parkman also is known for being one of the founders, in 1879, and first president of Boston&#x27;s St. Botolph Club, a social club which focuses on arts and literature.

==Legacy==
In recognition of his talent and accomplishments, the Society for American Historians annually awards the Francis Parkman Prize for the best book on American history.
His work has been praised by historians who have published essays in new editions of his work, such as Pulitzer Prize winners C. Vann Woodward, Allan Nevins, and Samuel Eliot Morison, as well as by other notable historians including Wilbur R. Jacobs, John Keegan, William Taylor, Mark Van Doren, and David Levin. Famous artists such as Thomas Hart Benton and Frederic Remington have illustrated Parkman&#x27;s books. Numerous translations have been published worldwide.

In 1865 Parkman built a house at 50 Chestnut Street on Beacon Hill in Boston, which has since become a National Historic Landmark. The &quot;Francis Parkman School&quot; in Forest Hills bears his name, as does &quot;Parkman Drive&quot; and the granite Francis Parkman Memorial at the site of his last home in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts (now a neighborhood of Boston). On September 16, 1967, the United States Postal Service honored Parkman with a Prominent Americans series 3¢ postage stamp with the wording, &quot;FRANCIS PARKMAN AMERICAN HISTORIAN U.S. POSTAGE&quot;.

Parkman&#x27;s essay &quot;Some of the Reasons Against Woman Suffrage&quot; was a best-seller for decades. The Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women continued to use Parkman&#x27;s writing and prestigious name long after his death.

==Criticism==

Parkman&#x27;s work regarding nationality, race, and especially Native Americans has generated criticism. C. Vann Woodward wrote that Parkman permitted his bias to control his judgment, employed the trope of &quot;national character&quot; to colour sketches of French and English, and drew a distinction between Indian &quot;savagery&quot; and settler &quot;civilization&quot;, for Parkman found the Indian practice of scalping appalling, and made sure to underscore his aversion. The French-trained historian W. J. Eccles harshly criticized what he perceived as Parkman&#x27;s bias against France and Catholic policies, as well as what he considered Parkman&#x27;s misuse of French language sources. Elsewhere Eccles wrote, &quot;Francis Parkman&#x27;s epic work &quot;La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West&quot; (Boston, 1869) is doubtless a great literary work, but, as history, it is, to say the least, of dubious merit.&quot;

Parkman&#x27;s view on women brought much criticism to what he had written. Parkman called the women of the more aggressive west to be &quot;scraggy necked&quot; also claiming that he disliked the company of the westerners. His preference in company was for that of more &quot;gentlemen&quot; societies or of those he viewed as below him who were willing to do as he said. As for the women in these &quot;gentlemanly&quot; societies, he still made himself view them as frail and dependent on men even though he had physical dependencies on them.
Other modern historians have praised elements of Parkman&#x27;s work, even while recognizing his limitations. The historian Robert S. Allen has said that Parkman&#x27;s history of France and England in North America &quot;remains a rich mixture of history and literature which few contemporary scholars can hope to emulate&quot;. The historian Michael N. McConnell, while acknowledging the historical errors and racial prejudice in Parkman&#x27;s book &quot;The Conspiracy of Pontiac&quot;, has said:
The American literary critic Edmund Wilson, in his book &quot;O Canada&quot;, described Parkman&#x27;s &quot;France and England in North America&quot; in these terms: &quot;The clarity, the momentum and the color of the first volumes of Parkman&#x27;s narrative are among the most brilliant achievements of the writing of history as an art.&quot;

<doc id="436841" wikidata="Q249061" url="?curid=436841" title="Moqua Well">
<text>The Moqua Well is a small underground lake, in Nauru.

==History==
During World War II, Moqua Well was the primary source of drinking water for inhabitants of Nauru. It is for this reason that the body of water is referred to as a well instead of a lake.

In 2001, Nauruan authorities decided to put up a fence to prevent accidents, after an alcohol-related drowning in the same year.

==Location==

The well is located below the Yaren district. The Moqua Well is not well known, one of a few attractions in Nauru. Nearby are the Moqua Caves, a series of caves below Yaren.

===Linguistic disambiguation===

The name of the well &#x27;Moqua&#x27; (sometimes referred to as &#x27;Makwa&#x27;) is derived from the former name by which Yaren was known.

<doc id="436843" wikidata="Q230495" url="?curid=436843" title="Kim Raver">
<text>Kimberly Jayne Raver (born March 15, 1969) is an American actress. She is known for television roles such as Dr. Teddy Altman on ABC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Kim Zambrano on &quot;Third Watch&quot;, and Audrey Raines on &quot;24&quot;.

== Early life ==
Kim Raver was born and raised in New York City by her mother. She attended Boston University, where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in drama.

She is fluent in French and German, a language that she learned as a child from her German-born mother.

== Career ==

=== Initial career (1974–2008) ===
Raver got her start as a child star in 1975 appearing on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; at age 6. She remained on the show for three years. She initially acted in commercials for Visa and Jeep when her adult career began. Her first prominent role was her Broadway debut in 1995 in the Philip Barry play &quot;Holiday&quot; in which she co-starred with Laura Linney and Tony Goldwyn. She also appeared in the feature film &quot;City Hall&quot; with Al Pacino. She also co-starred with John Spencer and David Schwimmer in &quot;The Glimmer Brothers,&quot; a production of the Williamstown Theatre Festival, written by Warren Leight. After her time on &quot;Third Watch&quot;, she was cast as Audrey Raines in the television series &quot;24&quot;, and was a series regular for two seasons.

During the fall 2006 television season, Raver starred in the ABC television series &quot;The Nine&quot;. Although the show received outstanding critical reviews, it did not take off in the Nielsen ratings and was cancelled. She reprised her role in &quot;24&quot;″s season 6 as Audrey Raines. The character was in a catatonic state at the end of the season.

Raver starred as Nico Reilly, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Bonfire&quot; magazine, in NBC&#x27;s television drama series &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot;. The show was adapted from the Candace Bushnell novel and ran for 20 episodes from February 2008-January 2009.

=== Stardom with &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2009–2012) ===
Raver joined Season 6 of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in a recurring role as Dr. Teddy Altman, a cardiothoracic surgeon brought in by Dr. Owen Hunt, who served with her in Iraq. She made her on-screen debut on November 12. It was announced on January 4, 2010, that Raver had become a series regular on the show. On May 18, 2012, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; creator, Shonda Rhimes, announced that Raver had decided to leave &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; after three seasons, &quot;I know this season&#x27;s finale had some surprises for viewers and the exit of Kim Raver was one of the big ones. But Kim&#x27;s series option was up and she was ready to give Teddy Altman a much-needed vacation. It&#x27;s been a pleasure working with someone as talented and funny and kind as Kim; everyone is going to miss her terribly. I like to imagine that Teddy is still out there in the Grey&#x27;s Anatomy universe, running Army Medical Command and building a new life.&quot; When the news of her departure was released, Raver wrote on her Twitter, &quot;I&#x27;ve had one of the best times of my creative career working on Grey&#x27;s with Shonda, Betsy and the best cast on Television,&quot; she wrote, adding: &quot;I feel fortunate and grateful to have worked with such an amazing team at GA [Grey&#x27;s Anatomy]. [I] am going to miss everyone!! And to the GA [Grey&#x27;s Anatomy] fans, you guys rock! I am sure S9 [season nine] will be great!

=== Later career (2013–present) ===
In 2014, Raver returned to the role of Audrey Boudreau (née Heller, then married and known as Raines) for the twelve-episode &quot;24: Live Another Day&quot;. In 2015, she had a guest appearance on the eleventh-season premiere of &quot;Bones&quot;.

In 2017, Raver recurred on the fifth season of &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; and also returned as Dr. Teddy Altman on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; for its 14th season. In the same year, Raver was cast in the recurring role of Dr. Andrea Frost on the second season of the ABC political drama &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;. In May 2018, it was announced that she would once again become a series regular on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, beginning with its 15th season.

Raver continues to study theater in New York with teacher and mentor Wynn Handman.

== Personal life ==
Raver has been married to director and writer Manuel Boyer since 2000. They have two sons.

<text>Times and Seasons was a 19th-century Latter Day Saint newspaper published at Nauvoo, Illinois. It was printed monthly or twice-monthly from November 1839 to February 1846. The motto of the paper was &quot;Truth will prevail,&quot; which was printed underneath the title heading. It was the successor to the &quot;Elders&#x27; Journal&quot; and was the last newspaper published by the Church in the United States before the schisms that occurred after the death of Joseph Smith.

==History==
As members of the early Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints fled Missouri as a result of the 1838 Mormon War, the press and type for the &quot;Elders&#x27; Journal&quot; was buried in Far West. In April 1839, Elias Smith and Hiram Clark, among others, returned to the city and recovered the press and type. It was taken to Nauvoo and in June 1839 was given to Ebenezer Robinson and Don Carlos Smith (younger brother of Joseph Smith), who served as the editors. In December 1840, Robinson moved exclusively to book printing while Don Carlos took over as the sole editor of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;. In May 1841, Robert B. Thompson joined as an editor. After the death of Don Carlos in 1841, Robinson rejoined as an editor and worked with Thompson on a single issue before Thompson&#x27;s death, just twenty days after the death of Don Carlos. Robinson was then joined by Gustavus Hills for a few issues before he deeded the print shop to Joseph Smith. in January 1842. Joseph acted as director of the print shop and was listed as editor in the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, but operation was actually run by John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff. In November 1842, Taylor became the principal editor, but was still assisted by Woodruff. The printing office was eventually sold to Taylor directly in January 1844.

==Contents==
The publication was the first to include such significant Latter Day Saint documents as The Wentworth Letter, a construction of the King Follett Discourse, the Book of Abraham (which was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of their Pearl of Great Price), the personal history of Joseph Smith, and the announcement of the assassination of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.

==Namesakes==
From 1974 to 1977, a periodical entitled &quot;The New Times and Seasons&quot; was published by the Church of Jesus Christ Restored, a group that broke from the RLDS Church in 1979. The church&#x27;s president, Stanley M. King, opened the first issue with a prospectus claiming the paper was a continuation of the original &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;. The paper republished many articles, letters, and other materials published in the original Nauvoo newspaper. It was published in Owen Sound, Ontario.

Another breakaway sect, the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days, which split from the LDS church, published a periodical entitled &quot;The Manti Times and Seasons&quot;. Its purpose was &quot;to uplift and encourage all those who truly seek to reclaim the House of Israel and redeem the Zion of our God.&quot; The first issue was published in August 1996. The periodical was edited and printed by J. K. Braddy in Manti, Utah.

<doc id="436846" wikidata="Q1543955" url="?curid=436846" title="Alice Deejay">
<text>Alice Deejay are a Dutch Eurodance project founded and produced by Wessel van Diepen, Dennis van den Driesschen, Sebastiaan Molijn and Eelke Kalberg (Pronti &amp; Kalmani), fronted by singer Judith Anna Pronk. They are best known for their 1998 single &quot;Better Off Alone&quot;, which was a worldwide success, selling over one million albums and 5 million singles worldwide.

==History==
Formed in 1998, Alice Deejay launched their career with their debut single, &quot;Better Off Alone&quot;, credited as &quot;DJ Jurgen presents Alice Deejay&quot;. The song reached the top 10 in many European countries and also charted in North America. In the UK, the song went platinum and reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 3 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play, also reaching number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their second single, &quot;Back in My Life&quot;, was released in November 1999 and reached number-one in Norway, and the top 10 in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

The project&#x27;s only album was &quot;Who Needs Guitars Anyway?&quot;, and was released in March 2000. It entered the top ten of the UK Albums Chart. They released three more singles from the album, &quot;Will I Ever&quot;, &quot;The Lonely One&quot; and &quot;Celebrate Our Love&quot;, and all reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom. Pronk, together with backing-singers, toured dance-themed venues to perform live. In 2002, this line-up made their final appearance together. 
=== First revival ===
After more than a decade of inactivity, in 2014 the producers who originally launched Alice Deejay revived the group, with new vocalist Ilona, a Dutch singer and DJ. The new lineup changed its name slightly to &quot;Alice DJ&quot; and began touring.

=== Reunion tour ===
20 years after her last performance as Alice Deejay, in October 2021 the group announced that Pronk would be returning to the group, with several tour dates announced across Europe for the remainder of the year.

On 16 October 2021, Pronk returned as Alice Deejay again live on stage after 20 years at the Ethias Arena in Belgium. She made her final appearance on stage at Kubix Festival, Newcastle in United Kingdom on 14 December 2024.

==Production==
The project was founded and produced by Danski (Dennis van den Driesschen) and Delmundo (Wessel van Diepen), along with their protégés Pronti (Sebastiaan Molijn) and Kalmani (Eelke Kalberg).

<text>The Heart of England Way is a long-distance walk of around through the Midlands of England. The walk starts from Milford Common on Cannock Chase and ends at Bourton on the Water in the Cotswolds linking south Staffordshire through Warwickshire to east Gloucestershire (or vice versa).

It crosses seven others: the Beacon Way, Staffordshire Way, Two Saints Way, Arden Way, Cotswold Way, Oxfordshire Way, and Thames Path. It is maintained by the Heart of England Way Association.

On 3 April 2021, Richard Antrobus set a new record, north to south, nonstop of 19 hours 47 minutes. Food and water was provided at prearranged places to comply with Covid restrictions in place at the time. Diversions due to construction of HS2 were followed with the final distance covered being 104 miles. This was confirmed by two separate trackers carried for the entire route.

On 20 July 2013, Ultra Runner David Hollyoak set a solo course record of completing the entire length of the Heart Of England Way (south to north) nonstop in 25 hours 11 minutes. The run is corroborated by having a relay of runners to run sections with him all the way.

<text>Matija Ljubek (; 22 November 1953 – 11 October 2000) was a Croatian sprint canoeist who competed in the 1970s and 1980s and later became a sports official.

Born in Belišće, Osijek-Baranja, Ljubek competed in four Summer Olympics where he won four medals. This included two golds (C-1 1000 m: 1976, C-2 500 m: 1984 with Mirko Nišović), one silver (C-2 1000 m: 1984 with Mirko Nišović), and one bronze (C-1 500 m: 1976). His trainer was Laszlo Hingl. He also won ten medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships with four golds (C-1 1000 m: 1978, C-2 500 m: 1982, 1983; C-2 10000 m: 1985), three silvers (C-1 10000 m: 1981, C-2 1000 m: 1982, 1985), and three bronzes (C-1 10000 m: 1975, 1978; C-2 1000 m: 1983).

In 1976 he was awarded a Golden Badge award for best athlete of Yugoslavia.

Ljubek later became vice-president of the Croatian Olympic Committee and served as &quot;chef de mission&quot; for the Croatian Olympic team.

Ljubek died in 2000 when he was shot by an estranged brother-in-law while trying to defend his mother in Valpovo, Osijek-Baranja, six days after returning from the 2000 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="436856" wikidata="Q7732662" url="?curid=436856" title="The Evening and the Morning Star">
<text>The Evening and the Morning Star was an early Latter Day Saint movement newspaper published monthly in Independence, Missouri, from June 1832 to July 1833, and then in Kirtland, Ohio, from December 1833 to September 1834. Reprints of edited versions of the original issues were also published in Kirtland under the title Evening and Morning Star.

==Printing in Missouri==
&quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; was the first Latter Day Saint newspaper. It was initially published in the printing office of W. W. Phelps in Independence, Missouri. The first issue was printed in June 1832 as volume 1 number 1. Printing continued until the office was destroyed by a mob on 20 July 1833, in response to an article published in &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; about U.S. and Missouri laws regarding slavery, African-Americans, and mixed-raced Americans. According to a letter written by John Whitmer and Phelps, proslavery Missourians responded with an outraged manifesto, in which Mormons were decried as &quot;...deluded fanatics, or weak and designing knaves...&quot; and so forth. The mob destroyed Phelps&#x27;s printing office and numerous incomplete copies of the &quot;Book of Commandments&quot;. Volume 2 number 14 was the last issue of the newspaper published in Missouri.

==Printing resumed in Ohio==
After the Latter Day Saints were expelled from Jackson County, Missouri in late 1833, printing of &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; temporarily resumed in Kirtland, Ohio, in a printing shop owned by Frederick G. Williams. The editor in Kirtland was Oliver Cowdery and the plan was to eventually replace the Missouri paper with one unique to Ohio. The last issue of the newspaper was September 1834, volume 2 number 24. In it Cowdery wrote, &quot;As &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; was designed to be published at Missouri, it was considered that another name would be more appropriate for a paper in this place [Kirtland]; consequently, as the name of this church has lately been entitled the church of the Latter Day Saints... it is no more than just, that a paper &quot;disseminating&quot; the doctrines believed by the same, and &quot;advocating&quot; its character and rights, should be entitled &#x27;Messenger and Advocate.&#x27;&quot; Thus, in October 1834, &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; was succeeded by the &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot;.
==Reprint==
The last issue of &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; also announced that all issues of the newspaper would be reprinted in a format that was easier to bind. The reprinted issues were then released sporadically between January 1835 and October 1836 and contained significant changes. The most obvious change was the shortened name, &quot;Evening and Morning Star.&quot; But there were also a large number of editorial changes, such as articles being rearranged within and among the different issues.

==Origin of title==

Jesus Christ is referred to at Revelation 22:16 as the Bright Morning Star.

Additionally, the planet Venus is given the name &quot;Evening Star&quot; when it appears in the west after sunset and &quot;Morning Star&quot; when it appears in the east before sunrise. Some contest that the movement, or life cycle, of Venus corresponds to that of Jesus Christ and that is why the newspaper received its name of &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot;.

<text>INS &quot;Viraat&quot; (Sanskrit: Virāṭa meaning &quot;Giant&quot;) was a Centaur-class light aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy. INS &quot;Viraat&quot; was the flagship of the Indian Navy until was commissioned in 2013. The ship was completed and commissioned in 1959 as the Royal Navy&#x27;s , and decommissioned in 1984. She was sold to India in 1987. INS &quot;Viraat&quot; was commissioned into the Indian Navy on 12 May 1987, and served for almost 30 years.

In February 2015, the Navy stated that &quot;Viraat&quot; would be decommissioned the following year. The last British-built ship serving with the Indian Navy, she was the oldest aircraft carrier in service in the world. On 23 July 2016, &quot;Viraat&quot; sailed for the last time under her own power from Mumbai to Kochi, where she was dry-docked and prepared for decommissioning. She was towed out of Kochi on 23 October, returning to Mumbai on 28 October, where she was laid up. &quot;Viraat&quot; was formally decommissioned on 6 March 2017. After the failure of plans to convert her into a hotel and museum, she was sold for scrap and planned to be broken up beginning in September 2020, but the scrapping was stayed by the Supreme Court of India after 40% of the body had already been scrapped.

==Design==
INS &quot;Viraat&quot; had a 12° ski jump to operate the Sea Harrier along with a reinforced flight deck, and of armour over the magazines and machinery spaces. The magazine capacity included at least 80 lightweight torpedoes. The vessel retained commando transport capability for up to 750 troops and carried four LCVP landing craft in the aft section. In a wartime scenario, the ship could carry up to 26 combat aircraft and was suited for supporting amphibious operations and conducting ASW operations.

===Aircraft===
The aircraft on board INS &quot;Viraat&quot; were operated by four squadrons of the Naval air arm of the Indian Navy:
Primary strike aircraft have been the Sea Harriers operating several modern missiles such as the British anti-ship Sea Eagle missile, and the French Matra Magic missile for air-to-air combat. Other ordnance has included 68 mm rockets, runway-denial bombs, cluster bombs, and podded 30 mm cannon. In 2006, the Indian Navy started the &#x27;Limited Upgrade Sea Harrier (LUSH)&#x27; program by upgrading up to 15 Sea Harriers in collaboration with Israel by installing the Elta EL/M-2032 radar and the Rafael &#x27;Derby&#x27; medium-range air-to-air BVR missile.

The fleet also consisted of Kamov Ka-31 Helix-B airborne early warning aircraft and Kamov Ka-28 Helix-A helicopters.

All Sea Harrier operations from the deck of INS &quot;Viraat&quot; ceased on 6 May 2016 following the retirement of Harrier fleet.

==Operational history==
===Royal Navy===

INS &quot;Viraat&quot; was originally commissioned by the British Royal Navy as on 18 November 1959, 15 years after she was laid down in June 1944. She served as the flagship of the Royal Navy&#x27;s task force during the Falklands War in 1982 and was decommissioned from active duty in 1985. In April 1986, &quot;Hermes&quot; was towed from Portsmouth Dockyard to Devonport Dockyard to be refitted, re-activated and sold to India.

===Indian Navy===
After evaluating vessels from several countries, the Indian Navy purchased the vessel in April 1986 and gave her an extensive refit at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth, England, to allow for continued carrier operations into the next decade. New fire control equipment, navigation radars, improved NBC protection, and deck landing aids were installed in this refit. Boilers were converted to operate on distillate fuel.

&quot;India Today&quot; in 1988 reported that then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi went to the Bangaram Atoll in Lakshadweep on a holiday with his family and other prominent politicians and media persons on board the INS Viraat. The allegation has been refuted by a retired Indian Navy officer, Commodore Ajay Chitnis, who was involved in planning former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s 1987 Lakshadweep trip.

In September 1993, the engine room of the ship was flooded, putting the vessel out of service for several months. The vessel was back in service in 1995 and was fitted with a new search radar. Between July 1999 and April 2001, the ship completed another life-extension refit expected to extend her serviceability until 2010. This refit upgraded propulsion systems, added a package of sensors to sound emergency alerts and introduced modern communication systems. In addition, a long-range surveillance radar, weapon systems, and a new hangar with fire curtains were installed.

The ship underwent a fourth refit in Indian service from January to August 2009 at Cochin Shipyard, Kochi. The refit was expected to ensure her continued service in the Indian Navy until 2015, and the ship went through exercises in the Arabian Sea for a month and a half before being deployed to the Gulf of Aden. Navy officers later reported that the carrier might be kept in service until 2020, as two Indigenous Aircraft Carriers (IACs) seemed likely to be fully operational by then. On 12 July 2011, the ship arrived at Cochin shipyard for a short refit scheduled to be completed in two months and it was repainted. Indian Navy indicated that the ship could remain in service until 2020, provided that there are still Sea Harriers available for ship-borne operations.

On 2 November 2012, the ship arrived in Kochi for the first part of a major two-phase refit. In the first phase, the hull was cleaned, probed for corrosion, worn hull plates were reinforced and received a fresh coat of corrosion-resistant paint. The carrier sailed to Mumbai for further upgrades to her machinery before rejoining the fleet in the summer of 2013. The refit would enable her to serve through 2016 and was the final major refit before her decommissioning. In August–September 2015, the ship underwent a short refit to reinforce her hull and inspection before her participation in the International Fleet Review in February 2016.

===Decommissioning===
By 2013, &quot;Viraat&quot;″s age and cost of maintenance prompted the navy to begin the process to obtain Defence Ministry clearance for her decommissioning; in December 2014, a review board was established to determine the ship&#x27;s continued service life.

In February 2015, the navy announced plans to decommission the ship in 2016 and began the process to obtain Defence Ministry clearance for the carrier&#x27;s decommissioning. On 23 July 2016, &quot;Viraat&quot; sailed from Mumbai to Kochi for the last time under her own steam; by then, she had spent a total of 2,250 days at sea and had steamed a total of 1,094,215 kilometers. At Kochi, she underwent a month-long deactivation in preparation for decommissioning; during this period, her boilers, engines, propellers and rudders were removed. Deactivation was completed on 4 September, and the carrier was towed back to Mumbai on 23 October for her formal decommissioning ceremony. &quot;Viraat&quot; arrived in Mumbai on 28 October and was laid up. On 6 March 2017, she was decommissioned. &quot;Viraat&quot; was formally decommissioned on 6 March 2017. Her weapons systems and operational equipment were to have been removed by mid-2017.

==Preservation plans==
In July 2015, it was announced that the ship would be transferred to the Government of Andhra Pradesh for conversion into a museum ship at a cost of ; Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, confirmed the plans on 8 February 2016. By April 2016, however, the plans had apparently fallen through. A British businessman&#x27;s proposal to preserve the ship failed when its crowdfunding campaign failed to make a tenth of its goal and it was stated that if &quot;Viraat&quot; was not to be preserved, she would be scrapped.

On 1 November 2018 the Maharashtra cabinet approved the conversion of &quot;Viraat&quot; into India&#x27;s first moored maritime museum and marine adventure centre, to be located near Nivati, Sindhudurg district. This proposal, which included a hotel, did not attract tenders because of high cost, and the state government abandoned it in November 2019.

After an expert committee determined &quot;Viraat&quot; &#x27;s structural deterioration made her preservation unviable, the union government decided to scrap her and held an online auction; in July 2020, Gujarat-based shipping firm Shri Ram Shipping purchased the ship from the Metal Scrap Corporation for . She was scheduled be dismantled at Alang starting in September 2020. On 19 September 2020, &quot;Viraat&quot; was towed from her berth at the Mumbai Naval Dockyard to the scrappers at Alang in the Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, reaching the port at Alang on the evening of 22 September.

On 28 September, &quot;Viraat&quot; was beached at Alang. At the end of September, a private Mumbai-registered company, Envitech Marine Consultants Private Limited, offered to purchase the ship from Shree Ram Shipping and preserve her as a museum and tourist centre, to be provisionally berthed at Goa. The Goa state government gave its support provided the project was approved by the Ministry of Defence, the necessary clearances were obtained and the state would incur no financial obligations. Shree Ram Shipping offered to sell &quot;Viraat&quot; to Envitech for , provided the firm receive the clearances and assume all cost and risk. Discussions were in progress as of 1 October.

On 10 February 2021 a Supreme Court hearing stayed the dismantling of the ship. The Court heard that Envitech proposed to purchase the ship for RS 100 cr and sought responses from Shree Ram Shipping and the Ministry of Defence. On 10 April 2021, the Supreme Court informed counsel for Envitech that INS Viraat had already become private property of Shree Ram Group; who had testified that 40% of the ship had already been broken, and on 12 April 2021 the petition was dismissed saying it was too late since 40% of the ship had been dismantled.

There is a plan to have two of INS &quot;Viraat&quot;&#x27;s anchors displayed at the Port Museum in Alappuzha, which is being developed.

<text>Miltenberg () is a town in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany. It is the seat of the like-named district and has a population of over 9,000.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The old town lies on the Main’s left bank on the &quot;left knee&quot; of the &quot;Mainviereck&quot; (&quot;Main Square&quot;) between the Spessart and Odenwald ranges. Since the Main riverbed in the Miltenberg area is relatively near the foot of the Odenwald, only a narrow strip of usable land is left, little over 150 meters in width, which in past centuries was time and again flooded by the Main. The historic centre, which stands on this land, often sustained considerable damage in these floods. Only in the 21st century efficient flood control measures, most of all a wall, have significantly reduced the adverse effects of these floods. Since about the beginning of the 20th century, after buying land from the neighbouring community of Großheubach, Miltenberg has been expanding on the right bank.

== History ==

===Pre-history and Antiquity===
In pre-Roman times, circular ramparts were built on the Greinberg above Miltenberg and on the Bürgstadter Berg (also known as Wannenberg) northeast of Bürgstadt. These were in use as early as the Neolithic (Michelsberg culture) but mostly date from the late Bronze Age (Urnfield culture).

In the 150s, the Roman Empire pushed outwards its fortified border in Germania, establishing the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes which replaced the Odenwald-Neckar-Limes. From Miltenberg on northwards, the river Main became the border. East of Miltenberg a fortified palisade stretched to the south and east towards Walldürn and on to Lorch.

Two castra were established: the &quot;Altstadtkastell&quot; between Miltenberg and Kleinheubach (2.7 hectares) to the north and the &quot;Kastell Miltenberg-Ost&quot; in the direction of Bürgstadt (0.6 hectares). The former, which was likely built some years in advance of the overall change in the borderline, housed a cohort, the southernmost military presence on the Main. In 190/1, this was the &quot;cohort I Sequanorum et Rauricorum equitata&quot; (a mixed infantry and cavalry unit of 480 men). In addition, a scout unit (&quot;exploratores Triputienses&quot;) was based in the area, either in the &quot;Altstadtkastell&quot; or in a nearby separate fort. The cohort castrum likely was continuously occupied until about 260, when the Romans abandoned this part of their border after heavy raids by Germanic tribes. The castrum was destroyed by the Alemanni.

The Limes itself met the Main near the eastern castrum, &quot;Miltenberg-Ost&quot; which housed a Numerus, a smaller military unit. The exact line the wall followed for the first few kilometers near the Main is not known. This smaller fort was likely built in the 2nd century, probably soon after 150. It was in use at most until the middle of the 3rd century.

During their presence, the Romans also built at least two sanctuaries dedicated to Mercury on the Greinberg.

===Middle Ages===
After the withdrawal of the Romans from the area, the regional population declined. Burgundians and Alemanni moved through the lower Main region, but it was only under the Franks (after 500 AD) that the population density again rose noticeably. Their settlements often did not simply grow out of the formerly Roman cores but included separate newly established sites.

Early Medieval settlers concentrated on the area south of the former &quot;Altstadtkastell&quot;, northwest of the current town. A Carolingean church was likely built there (9th century) and stones from the castrum were used in early Medieval fortifications nearby. In the 10th to 12th century a town wall was added to this castle-like structure, largely following the foundations of the castrum. A flooded moat surrounded the wall. A Romanesque church was built inside the walled area. This settlement likely was the &quot;civitas Walehusen&quot;, owned by the Count Palatinate in his role as &quot;Vogt&quot; of Lorsch Abbey. This was destroyed in 1247 by troops of the Archbishop of Mainz, Siegfried III.

At this point, the population of Walehausen/Wallhausen was likely moved to the village Miltinburc, previously founded by Mainz during the first quarter of the 13th century and mentioned first in 1226. Another village, Vachhausen, in between Miltinburc and Wallhausen, was abandoned in the Middle Ages, but the Gothic &quot;Laurentiuskapelle&quot;, located far from the Medieval center of Miltenberg, was built on the remains of the earlier Romanesque parish church of Vachhausen.

Already by the early Middle Ages, the area&#x27;s red buntsandstein was highly sought-after, with products such as grindstones and columns being hewn in the surrounding woods. The so-called &quot;&quot; were made near Miltenberg. They are special bunter columns likely intended for Mainz Cathedral when it was built around the year 1000. The master builder, however, apparently decided that they were not needed, so they never became part of the cathedral. One of the monoliths now stands in Mainz’ cathedral square, a gift to the city on the occasion of the cathedral&#x27;s 1,000th anniversary in 1975. Other columns are at Munich &quot;(Bayerisches Nationalmuseum)&quot; and Nuremberg &quot;(Germanisches Nationalmuseum)&quot;.

Miltenberg/Miltinburc grew around a Mainz toll station built on the river bank in the 13th century, protected by the Mildenburg (castle). The castle itself dates from the 12th century. In 1237, the village was awarded the status of town. It profited from the &quot;Stapelrecht&quot; which forced passing merchants to store their wares locally and offer them for sale for some days. This boosted construction of inns and warehouses. For protection, walls from the castle were extended around the town. This oldest part of the town was just 100 meters east to west, extending west from today&#x27;s &quot;Schnatterloch&quot;. The first expansion of the settlement stretched east to the &quot;Mittelturm&quot; and west to the &quot;Schwertfegerturm&quot; (both later demolished). By the 14th century, the town had expanded to the limits which roughly endured until the 19th century: from &quot;Würzburger Tor&quot; (east) to &quot;Spitzenturm&quot;/&quot;Mainzer Tor&quot; (west).

During its financial heyday, Miltenberg also saw considerable construction activity: of the many secular and non-Christian Gothic structures today only the winery, a warehouse and the former synagogue remain. Gothic churches included the &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (St Jakobus) but it mostly lost its original exterior character when it was rebuilt in the 1830s. The nearby &quot;Wallfahrtskapelle Maria ad gradus&quot; (built circa 1400) was demolished in 1825. Close to the &quot;Spital zum heiligen Petrus&quot;, a hospital dedicated to St. Peter and founded circa 1310 by Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz, the &quot;Spitalkirche&quot; was constructed (demolished 1846).

Its strategic position on the bend of the navigable river and on the important trade route Nuremberg-Frankfurt made Miltenberg a politically influential member of the nine town league (&quot;Neun-Städte-Bund&quot;) of Mainz. This state of affairs lasted until the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525, when the local representative, Friedrich Weygand, sided with the peasants and was executed. He had also favoured the Reformation and after 1522, when Miltenberg finally became independent of the Bürgstadt parish, had helped , a supporter of Martin Luther, to head the new parish.

===Modern===
From 1667 the &quot;Franziskanerkirche&quot; was built by :de:Antonio Petrini. Most of the half-timbered houses dominating the appearance of the old town today date from the 15th to 18th centuries. The inn &quot;Zum Riesen&quot;, originally a Gothic house from circa 1400 was replaced in 1590 by the current building.

Until 1803, Miltenberg belonged to Electoral Mainz. After securalization and the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot;, Miltenberg passed to the Principality of Leiningen, with which it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1806. After having become part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1810, the town finally became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816.

In 1912 and 1951, Miltenberg acquired lands on the Main’s right bank to expand the town.

In 2006, the town made national headlines when parish priest Ulrich Boom rang the bells for 20 minutes during a rally of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany, thereby disrupting the event. Ulrich Boom later became Auxiliary Bishop.

=== Amalgamations===
The following villages were amalgamated into Miltenberg:
* 1 January 1971: Breitendiel
* 1 January 1976: Mainbullau
* 1 January 1976: Schippach (with Berndiel)
* 1 January 1976: Wenschdorf (with Monbrunn)

== Economy==
Tourism is very important for the economy of Miltenberg. Visitors are mainly day trippers from the urban agglomerations in Hesse (Hanau, Offenbach am Main, Darmstadt, Frankfurt), but bunter sandstone, some small and medium enterprises and crafts and trade are also important.

== Governance==
=== Mayors ===
* 1870-1905: Jakob Josef Schirmer
* 1906-1924: Franz Breitenbach
* 1925-1930: Roland Schmid
* 1930-1933: Wilhelm Schwesinger
* 1933-1935: Josef Funk
* 1935-1945: Anton Burkart
* 1945-1951: Oskar Sermersheim
* 1952-1966: Anton Blatz
* 1966-1978: Ludwig Büttner
* 1978-1990: Anton Vogel
* 1990-2014: Joachim Bieber
* 2014-2020: Helmut Demel
* since 2020: Bernd Kahlert

=== Town council ===
The council is made up of 20 council members with seats apportioned thus:
*CSU: 5 seats
* Liberale Miltenberger: 4 seats
*SPD: 3 seats
*B.90/Die Grünen: 2 seats
*ÖDP: 2 seats
* Miltenberger Wahlgemeinschaft e.V. MWG: 2 seats
* Bürgerliste Miltenberg: 1 seat
* FW: 1 seat

(as of the municipal election held in March 2020)

=== Town twinning ===
Miltenberg currently has two twin towns:
* Arnouville-lès-Gonesse, Val-d&#x27;Oise, France since June 1982
* Duchcov, Czech Republic since 2005

=== Sponsorship ===
In 1960, the sponsorship for the Sudeten Germans driven out of the town of Duchcov was undertaken, which eventually resulted in the town-twinning.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s arms might be described thus: Quartered, first and fourth squares are gules with a wheel of six spokes in argent, second and third squares are argent with the letter M in gules.

Miltenberg belonged from its founding in the 13th century until the Old Empire’s downfall in 1803 to Electoral Mainz which is the origin of the Wheel of Mainz. The M first appeared in a seal from the early 16th century that also included Saint Martin, as had earlier seals. The current arms are based on those that were once seen on the now vanished Schindtor, a town gate.

== Arts and culture==
===Main sights===
* Historic town centre with the &quot;Schnatterloch&quot;, the historic market square which served as a location for some scenes of the film &quot;The Spessart Inn&quot; (1958). Nearby are the Hotel &quot;Zum Riesen&quot; (one of Germany’s oldest inns, if not the oldest) and the old town hall. Miltenberg still has a total of around 150 half-timbered houses.
* &quot;Mildenburg&quot; (the local castle). It was the seat of the &quot;Oberamtmann&quot;, the Archbishop&#x27;s local administrator until 1803. It then passed to the Princes of Leiningen before purchased it in 1825. His widow sold it to , who also preserved several other castles on the Rhine and Mosel rivers. He set up a museum of his collection of antiquities in the Mildenburg. His nephew researched the Limes and discovered the &quot;Teutonenstein&quot; (see below). Conrady&#x27;s heirs auctioned off castle and collections. His nephew, August Conrady bought the &quot;Marstall&quot; (stables) and exhibited his art collection there. The castle has been under the town’s ownership since 1979. In 2010/2011, it was renovated. It now houses a museum of icons and contemporary art (&quot;Museum.Burg.Miltenberg&quot;). The castle’s inner ward once held the &quot;Teutonenstein&quot;, a 5 m-tall sandstone column found on Greinberg, the inscription of which is still a puzzle to this day. 
* Town museum &quot;Museum.Stadt.Miltenberg&quot;, which now contains the &quot;Teutonenstein&quot;
* Mainz Gate (&quot;Mainzer Tor&quot;)
* Würzburg Gate (&quot;Würzburger Tor&quot;)
* The Gothic &quot;Laurentiuskapelle&quot; (&quot;Saint Lawrence’s chapel&quot;) with its abutting graveyard.

===Tourism===
Miltenberg lies on the &quot;Fränkischer Rotwein Wanderweg&quot; (&quot;Franconian Red Wine Hiking Trail&quot;), which was established in 1990, and leads from Großwallstadt through Miltenberg to Bürgstadt.

A new concept was introduced with the &quot;Route der Industriekultur Rhein-Main&quot; (“Rhine-Main Industrial Culture Route”), which covers the 160 km between Miltenberg and Bingen. Industrial buildings in this area provide the visitors with the opportunity to learn about the industrial heritage in a regional context 700 buildings have already been scientifically catalogued, including Miltenberg’s old railway station.

===Gallery===
=== Regular events ===
*On the first weekend in July, the Town Festival (&quot;Stadtfest&quot;) is held.
*In late July, the &quot;Mildenburger Theatertage&quot; (“Theatre Days”) take place.
*Beginning on the last weekend in August and for ten days, the &quot;Michaelismesse&quot; (&quot;St Michael&#x27;s Fair&quot;), the biggest fair on the Bavarian Lower Main (&quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot;), is held (despite the similarity in names, it is not Michaelmas, which falls on 29 September, a month later).

==Infrastructure==
=== Transport ===
Miltenberg lies on the railway line from Aschaffenburg to Wertheim (Main Valley Railway). Moreover, the &#x27; branches off here towards Seckach. There are hourly connections to Aschaffenburg by day. In 1977, Deutsche Bundesbahn closed the terminus station right near the town (&#x27;) and replaced it with &quot;&quot;, a through station on the other side of the river.

Miltenberg is linked to the urban agglomerations in Hesse, where many inhabitants work. In 2008, the town bypass, which had been discussed and planned for more than 25 years was completed. The construction costs, a sum of €55,000,000, were for the first time ever in Bavaria financed by a public-private partnership scheme.

In Miltenberg various kinds of schools are represented:
* &quot;Grundschule Miltenberg&quot; (primary school)

<doc id="436866" wikidata="Q3007210" url="?curid=436866" title="Culture of Djibouti">
<text>The culture of the [[Djibouti|Republic of Djibouti]] is diverse due to the nation&#x27;s Red Sea location at a crossroads of trade and commerce.

Djiboutian population is divided into several human components: the Issa and the Anfar, the Muslim religion for the most part, that are traditionally attached to anthropological group Hamitic. They were called &quot;Hamites Orientals&quot; to distinguish them from these other Hamites that are Egyptians and Berbers. An important Arab community of Yemeni origin, is also based in Djibouti.

The Afars and the Issa Somalis who are characterized by slender physique, regular features, and proud bearing, they speak different Cushitic languages from the great Afroasiatic language family, and traditionally lived as nomadic pastoralists. However, the population tends to settle because today more than half of its citizens live in the capital and the towns and villages of the interior. This land, traditional crossing point between Egypt, Sudan and Saudi crossroads of nations between Africa and Asia, has likely undergone mixing of populations who have played an important role in the fate of the original peoples of the Djibouti nation. Poetry traditionally recited in the villages by special readers called gabaye was a way of recording the community&#x27;s history and customs, as well as current events.

==Ethnic groups==

Djibouti is a multiethnic country. The two largest ethnic groups are the Dir (clan) Somali (60%) and the Afar (35%). The Somali clan component is mainly composed of the Issas, followed by a sizable group of Gadabuursi and smaller numbers of Isaaq. Both are sub-clans of the larger Dir; the Issas form part of the Madoobe Dir, while the Gadabuursi are part of the Madaluug Dir. The remaining 5% of Djibouti&#x27;s population primarily consists of Arabs, Ethiopians and Europeans (French and Italians). Most local residents are urban dwellers; the remainder are pastoralists.

===Arabs===
Djiboutians have had expansive relations with the Arab world, as is manifested in its adoption of Arabic as an official language, its location within the Arabian Plate, its membership with the Arab League, its millennia-old trade relations with the peninsula&#x27;s Arabs, and more recently, initiatives for a transcontinental crossing that would permanently link Djiboutians to the Arabian Peninsula. Djibouti has also hosted Arab refugees, primarily from Yemen.

===Somali===
Somalis have traditionally been organized into nomadic pastoral clans, loose empires, sultanates and city-states.

Their clan groupings are important social units, wherein membership plays a central part in Somali culture. Clans are patrilineal and are often divided into sub-clans, sometimes with many sub-divisions. Somali society is traditionally ethnically endogamous. So as to extend ties of alliance, marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan.

===Afar===
Afar society has historically been organized into independent kingdoms, each ruled by its own Sultan. A portion of the community also consists of pastoralists, raising goats, sheep, and cattle in the desert.

Socially, they are organized into clan families and two main classes: the &quot;asaimara&quot; (&#x27;reds&#x27;) who are the dominant class politically, and the &quot;adoimara&quot; (&#x27;whites&#x27;) who are a working class and are found in the Mabla Mountains.

In addition, the Afar are reputed for their martial prowess. Men traditionally sport the &quot;jile&quot;, a famous curved knife. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs.

==Languages==

Djibouti is a multilingual nation. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, the majority of the population speaks Somali (524,000 speakers) or Afar (306,000 speakers) as a first language, which are the mother tongues of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively. Both languages belong to the larger Afroasiatic family. There are two official languages in Djibouti: Arabic (Afroasiatic) and French (Indo-European). Arabic is of social, cultural and religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of Modern Standard Arabic. Colloquially, about 59,000 local residents speak the Ta&#x27;izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect, also known as &quot;Djibouti Arabic&quot;. French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 10,200 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include Omani Arabic (38,900 speakers), Amharic (1,400 speakers), and Greek (1,000 speakers).

==Religion==
With few exceptions, Somali and Afar are entirely Muslims, the majority belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam. The constitution of Djibouti likewise defines Islam as the religion of the Republic of Djibouti. Islam entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted Muslims had, at Prophet Muhummad&#x27;s urging, sought refuge across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa. Islam may thus have been introduced to the area well before the faith even took root in its place of origin. Christianity is a minority religion in Djibouti, with around 4,767 adherents.

==Attire==

When not dressed in western clothing such as jeans and t-shirts, men typically wear the macawiis, which is a sarong-like garment worn around the waist. Among nomads, many wear a loosely wrapped white cotton robe called a tobe that goes down to about the knee, with the end thrown over the shoulder (much like a Roman toga).

Women typically wear the dirac, which is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length half-slip and a bra. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as shash, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the male jellabiya (jellabiyaad in Somali) and the female jilbāb is also commonly worn. For some occasions such as festivals, women may adorn themselves with specialized jewelry and head-dresses similar to those worn by the Berber tribes of the Maghreb.

==Music==
Djibouti&#x27;s various ethnic groups each have their own different styles of music and accompanying dances. Common instruments used by many of the communities are the drum, tanbura and oud. Somali and Afar have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali and Afar folklore. Most Somali songs are pentatonic; that is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or Arabia, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (&quot;midho&quot;), songwriters (&quot;lahan&quot;) and singers (&quot;&#x27;odka&quot; or &quot;voice&quot;).

==Sport==

Football is the most popular sport in Djibouti. The Djibouti national football team, nicknamed the &quot;Riverains de la Mer Rouge&quot; (&quot;Shoremen of the Red Sea&quot;), plays various international squads both locally and abroad. It is controlled by the Djiboutian Football Federation, and is a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA). There are also hundreds of football clubs that compete at the domestic level.

Basketball is the second most popular sport. At world basketball, Djibouti is represented by the &quot;Fédération Djiboutienne de Basket Ball&quot;. Unlike neighboring countries Ethiopia or Somalia, Djibouti has never appeared for the African Basketball Championship at either senior or junior level, men or women.

<doc id="436870" wikidata="Q540453" url="?curid=436870" title="Peter Pace">
<text>Peter Pace (born November 5, 1945) is a retired United States Marine Corps general who served as the 16th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Pace was the first Marine officer appointed as chairman and the first Marine officer to be appointed to three different four-star assignments; the others were as the sixth vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from October 1, 2001, to August 12, 2005, and as Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Southern Command from September 8, 2000, to September 30, 2001.

===2000s: Joint Chiefs of Staff===
Pace was promoted to general and assumed duties as the commander-in-chief of United States Southern Command on September 8, 2000, until September 30, 2001, when he was appointed Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On August 12, 2005, he was succeeded as vice chairman by Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani.
On April 22, 2005, at a White House press conference, President George W. Bush nominated Pace to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The previous chairman, Richard Myers, retired from the position on September 30, 2005.

On his nomination, Pace said, &quot;This is an incredible moment for me. It is both exhilarating and humbling. It&#x27;s exhilarating because I have the opportunity, if confirmed by the Senate, to continue to serve this great nation. It&#x27;s humbling because I know the challenges ahead are formidable.&quot;

On June 29, 2005, Pace appeared before the Armed Services Committee for consideration of his nomination and was later confirmed by the Senate. On September 30, 2005, Pace was sworn in as the 16th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
On November 29, 2005, Pace was present at a press conference given by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, where Rumsfeld said that &quot;the United States does not have a responsibility&quot; to prevent torture by Iraqi officials. Pace drew a distinction between the national responsibility of the United States and the responsibility of individual service members, saying &quot;It is the absolute responsibility of every U.S. service member, if they see inhumane treatment being conducted, to intervene, to stop it&quot;.

In 2006 Pace was named Grand Marshal of New York City&#x27;s Columbus Day parade.

In a 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Pace was asked about the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy and said &quot;I believe that homosexual acts between individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts... I do not believe that the armed forces of the United States are well served by a saying through our policies that it&#x27;s OK to be immoral in any way.&quot; The comments sparked backlash from legislators such as Senator John Warner, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Congressman Marty Meehan. Pace later said he regretted the comments and that they were his &quot;personal moral views.&quot;

After White House officials asserted that Iran was supplying insurgents in Iraq with munitions, Pace questioned the validity of the claim in a February 2007 press conference. Specifically, Pace questioned the existence of direct evidence linking the Iranian government to the supply of the weapons, explosively formed penetrators.

===Retirement===
On June 8, 2007, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that he would advise the President to not renominate Pace because of concerns about contentious confirmation hearings in Congress. The President instead nominated the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, to replace Pace. On October 1, 2007, Pace officially retired at Fort Myer, Virginia.

On one of his last days before retirement, Pace gave a speech at Chaminade High School on Long Island, the high school of the first Marine who died under his command in Vietnam, Guido Farinaro.

After his retirement ceremony, Pace visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. There, he left handwritten notes in memory of each of the Marines who died under his command while he was a platoon leader in Vietnam, with a set of his general&#x27;s rank insignia attached to each one. Each note was similar to this one:

These are yours – not mine! With love and respect, your platoon leader, Pete Pace.

===Post-military career===
On October 1, 2007, the editors of the &quot;National Review&quot; encouraged Virginia voters to draft Pace to run in 2008 for the Senate seat to be vacated by retiring Senator John Warner. The magazine cited Pace&#x27;s conservative Catholic beliefs in making its suggestion.

On April 3, 2008, private equity firm Behrman Capital announced that Pace had joined the firm as an operating partner and been named chairman of the board of Behrman portfolio company, Pelican Products. He was also named a director of ILC Industries, Inc., also a Behrman company.

Pace also currently serves on the Secretary of Defense&#x27;s Policy Board, and as chairman of the board for Wall Street Warfighters Foundation, an organization founded by principals of Drexel Hamilton that provides training support and job placement services for disabled veterans interested in careers in the financial services industry.

Pace serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military service organization.

During the 2016 United States presidential election, the Trump transition team chaired by New Jersey governor Chris Christie recommended Pace to be Trump&#x27;s National Security Advisor.

Pace became chair of the board of trustees for the Naval Institute Foundation on January 31, 2017. Founded in 1873, the US Naval Institute provides an independent forum for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.

<doc id="436876" wikidata="Q846723" url="?curid=436876" title="One-pocket">
<text>One-pocket is a pool game. Only one pocket for each player is used in this game, unlike other games played on a pool table where any can be used to score . The object of the game is to score points. A point is made when a player pockets any object ball into their designated pocket. The winner is the first to score an agreed-upon number of points (usually 8). 

One-pocket is similar to straight pool in that a player can shoot at any object ball regardless of its color or number. Unlike straight pool, however, a shooter does not need to call their shots.

Penalties for a are the loss of 1 point, re- a previously pocketed ball if possible, and in the case of a , the incoming player gets behind the . Three consecutive fouls is a loss of game. If a player pockets an object ball in a pocket other than those at the top of the table, their turn ends and that object ball is respotted, unless an object ball is also potted into their designated pocket on the same shot. If the player pockets an object ball in the opponent&#x27;s pocket, their turn also ends and the opponent earns a point.

==History==

The first one-pocket tournament was held in 1961, promoted by the Jansco brothers. The winner of the event was Johnny Vives. Hayden W. Lingo, author of the first published rules on one-pocket, wrote the rules adopted as the basis for the tournament rules.

American pool player and entertainer Rudolph &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; Wanderone allegedly said the game of one-pocket was like chess (later admitting that he had actually never played a game of chess). On the other hand, Wanderone&#x27;s public rival, Willie Mosconi, called one-pocket a gimmick game for gamblers.

Well known one pocket players and commentators such as Hall of famer Danny DiLiberto, Accu-Stats host Billy Incardona, and Mosconi Cup coach Jeremy Jones have often compared the game to chess, with a beginning, middle, and end game, and similar strategic elements. A player must be careful not to leave the opponent with a good shot, or the opponent may be able to capitalize on a successful shot for successive shots and never let the original player shoot again. A player may even intentionally pocket a ball into their opponent’s pocket, thereby conceding a point, in order to prevent the opponent from being able to pocket that ball and use it to get (ideal position) on a subsequent next shot.

The game is very popular with gamblers, and frequently attracts high stakes. One-pocket plays a major role in the yearly Derby City Classic that is played in Louisville, Kentucky, each January. 

One of the most famous players of the game is Grady &quot;the Professor&quot; Mathews, who has written articles and published a number of instructional videos on the game. The two main reference works on one-pocket are &quot;Winning One-Pocket&quot; and &quot;One-Pocket Shots, Moves and Strategies&quot;, both written by player and gambler, Eddie Robins. The books, now out of print, often sell on the used market for over US$200 each. 

Another well-known one-pocket player is Efren Reyes. His victories in the game include the Galveston World Classic One Pocket (2009) and the US Open One-pocket Championship (2000, 2011) and the Derby City One-pocket event (1999, 2004–2007 and 2014).

One-pocket was the main game featured in the 2007 film, &quot;Turn the River&quot;, the story of a female pool hustler who plays high-stakes pool. The film ends with a nine-ball match, with the main character saying that nine-ball &quot;seems like a chumpy game for us.&quot;

==Set up and break==
The balls in a one-pocket rack are placed randomly, similar to straight pool and bank pool. Before the , the player breaking (typically after winning the or coin flip) chooses a for the rest of the game; all of that shooter&#x27;s balls must be shot into that pocket. All of the opponent&#x27;s balls must be made in the other foot corner pocket.

==Handicapping==
One-pocket is a very flexible game for players of different skill levels, and many variations are used to handicap a game. The stronger player, for instance, might need 10 points to win versus 6 points for the weaker player (called a &quot;10-6 &quot;). Also, as the break shot is so critical in the game, spotting someone the breaks can be a very strong equalizer.

Handicapping one player by allowing points to be scored on and shots only is a particularly challenging spot, as the free-scoring opponent has a much greater variety of options for both balls to pocket and (defensive positioning of the cue ball after a shot) to play against the opponent.

<text>The Latter Day Saints&#x27; Messenger and Advocate, often shortened to Messenger and Advocate, was an early Latter Day Saint monthly newspaper published in Kirtland, Ohio, from October 1834 to September 1837. It was the successor to &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; and the predecessor to the &quot;Elders&#x27; Journal&quot;.

==History==
The &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; was established after a mob had destroyed the printing press of &quot;The Evening and the Morning Star&quot; in Independence, Missouri, on July 20, 1833, causing the &quot;Star&quot; to relocate to Kirtland. After a brief run, the &quot;Star&quot; was discontinued in favor of a uniquely Ohio newspaper, the &quot;Latter Day Saints&#x27; Messenger and Advocate&quot;. Oliver Cowdery served as editor and the first issue was printed in October 1834.

The May 1835 issue was the last with Cowdery as editor, because there was &quot;other business and other duties, in which my services are requisite.&quot; John Whitmer replaced Cowdery as editor. Whitmer may have been heavily assisted in his duties by W. W. Phelps.

In March 1836, Cowdery again became editor when both Whitmer and Phelps returned to Missouri. Cowdery&#x27;s brother Warren claimed that he was actually performing the editorial duties. In February 1837, the printing press was sold to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, and Warren Cowdery became the editor. The last issue was published in September 1837 after LDS Church leaders became dissatisfied with Warren Cowdery&#x27;s efforts. In October 1837 the newspaper was succeeded by the &quot;Elders&#x27; Journal&quot;.

==Rigdonite &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot;==
In 1844, Sidney Rigdon asserted a claim to be the successor of Joseph Smith and he organized a group of Latter Day Saints in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This group began to publish a periodical in 1845 that revived the name, &quot;Latter Day Saints&#x27; Messenger and Advocate&quot;. Ebenezer Robinson (founding publisher of the LDS newspaper &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;) became the printer of this Rigdonite paper. After Rigdon changed the name of the church back to the original &quot;Church of Christ,&quot; the periodical became the &quot;Messenger and Advocate of the Church of Christ&quot;.

The name &quot;Messenger and Advocate,&quot; or variations thereof, has been used many times since the Kirtland and Rigdonite newspapers. In 1977, a short-lived magazine, entitled &quot;The New Messenger and Advocate&quot;, was published. It was printed by the Guild of Mormon Writers as a means of disseminating their fiction, non-fiction, and poetical writings. The preliminary issue was released in June 1977. Discussions soon began of joining &quot;The New Messenger and Advocate&quot; with &quot;Sunstone Magazine&quot;. The merger became official with the release of the November/December 1977 issue of &quot;Sunstone Magazine&quot;.

From 1984 to 1989, Art Bulla published a newsletter for his newly organized Church of Jesus Christ, a splinter sect of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The newsletter carried the name of &quot;Zion&#x27;s Messenger and Advocate&quot;. It was created as a &quot;vehicle for the free expression of news and views, concerning doctrine and events which surround the coming forth of the Kingdom of Zion at this time.&quot;

Another sect of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Independent Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also published a periodical using the &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; title. The magazine, called the &quot;Independent Latter Day Saints&#x27; Messenger and Advocate&quot;, was first published in January 1987 with Christopher C. Warren as editor. It was meant to be the voice for the Independent Church, which was &quot;divided into three self-governing and autonomous organisations known, respectively, as the &quot;Church of the Firstborn&quot;, the &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, and the &quot;Restoration Christian Fellowships&quot;.

Currently, there is a popular Mormon-themed blog, part of the so-called Bloggernacle or community of Mormon blogs, that carries the name &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot;.

<text>The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental organization. It was founded in the UK in 1919; its goal is to improve the lives of children worldwide.

The organization raises money to improve children&#x27;s lives by creating better educational opportunities, better health care, and improved economic opportunities. It achieves this through several methods, including health, education, and protection programs.

The organization has general consultative status in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

== Origins ==
The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton in an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice.

At the end of World WarI, images of malnourished and sick children ran throughout Europe. The Fight the Famine Council was initially started earlier in 1919 to put political pressure on the British government to end the blockade, the first meeting having been held at the home of Catherine Courtney, at 15 Cheyne Walk. On 15 April 1919, the sisters separated from the council and created the &quot;Save the Children Fund&quot;.

In May 1919, the Fund was publicly established at a meeting in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall to &quot;provide relief to children suffering the effects of war&quot; and raise money for emergency aid to children suffering from wartime shortages of food and supplies.

Jebb and her sister, Buxton, worked to gain exposure to elicit aid. In December 1919, Pope Benedict XV publicly announced his support for Save the Children and declared 28 December &quot;Innocents Day&quot; to collect donations.

The first branch was opened in Fife, Scotland in 1919. A counterpart, Rädda Barnen (which also means &quot;Save the Children&quot;), was founded later that year, on November 19, in Sweden with Anna Kleman on the board. Along with many other organizations, they founded the International Save the Children Union in Geneva on 6 January 1920. Jebb built relationships with other Geneva-based organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, who supported Save&#x27;s International Foundation.

Jebb used fund-raising techniques to gain exposure, for example, making Save the Children the first charity in the United Kingdom to use page-length advertisements in newspapers. Jebb contracted doctors, lawyers, and other professionals to devise mass advertisement campaigns. In 1920, Save the Children started individual child sponsorship to engage more donors. By the end of the year, Save the Children raised the equivalent of about £8,000,000 in today&#x27;s money.

=== Russian famine ===
By August 1921, the UK Save the Children had raised over £1,000,000, and conditions for children in Central Europe were improving due to their efforts. However, the Russian famine of 1921 made Jebb realize that Save the Children must be a permanent organization and that children&#x27;s rights constantly need to be protected. Their mission was thus changed to &quot;an international effort to preserve child life wherever it is menaced by conditions of economic hardship and distress&quot;.

From 1921 to 1923, Save the Children created press campaigns, propaganda movies, and feeding centers in Russia and Turkey to accommodate and educate thousands of refugees. They began to work with several other organizations such as the Russian Famine Relief Fund and Nansen which resulted in recognition by the League of Nations. Although Russia was largely closed off to international relief and aid, Save the Children persuaded Soviet authorities to let them have a ground presence.

At home, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; criticized the Fund&#x27;s work, denying the severity of the situation and arguing they should be helping their people before helping Russia. The charity responded with increased publicity about the famine, showing images of starving children and mass graves. The campaign gained national appeal, eventually allowing the organization to charter the SS &quot;Torcello&quot; to Russia with 600 tons of relief supplies. Over 157 million rations were given out, saving nearly 300,000 children. Improved conditions meant Save the Children&#x27;s Russian feeding program was able to be closed in the summer of 1923, after having won international acclaim.

=== Second World War ===
Save the Children staff were among the first into the liberated areas after World War II, working with refugee children and displaced persons in former occupied Europe, including Nazi concentration camps survivors. During this same time, work in the United Kingdom focused on improving conditions for children growing up in cities devastated by bombing and facing huge disruptions in family life.

=== Continuing crises ===
The 1950s saw a continuation of this type of crisis-driven work, with additional demands for help following the Korean War and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and the opening of new work in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East in response to the decline of the British empire.

Like other aid agencies, Save the Children was active in the major disasters of the era—especially the Vietnam War and the Biafra secession in Nigeria. The latter brought shocking images of child starvation onto the television screens of the West for the first time in a major way. The sort of mass-marketing campaigns first used by Save the Children in the 1920s was repeated, with great success in fundraising.

Disasters in Ethiopia, Sudan, and many other world hotspots led to appeals that brought public donations on a huge scale, and a consequent expansion of the organization&#x27;s work. However, the children&#x27;s rights-based approach to development originated by Jebb continues to be an important factor. It was used in a major campaign in the late 1990s against the use of child soldiers in Africa.

During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, new cases outnumbered the available hospital beds in the country. Save the Children worked with the UK government&#x27;s Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence to build and run a 100-bed treatment center in Sierra Leone, as well as support an Interim Care Center in Kailahun for children who had lost their families to Ebola.

== Structure and accountability ==
Save the Children is an international umbrella organization, with 30 national member organizations serving over 120 countries. Members lead on activities within their home territory and work with donors to develop programs abroad, which are coordinated and delivered by a central body – Save the Children International – via teams on the ground in each country. Save the Children International also oversees humanitarian responses.

All members of the association are bound by the International to Save the Children Alliance Bylaws which include The Child Protection Protocol and Code of Conduct. These set a standard for common values, principles, and beliefs.

== Controversies ==
=== &quot;The Save the Children Fund Film&quot; ===
In 1969, Save the Children UK commissioned film director Ken Loach and producer Tony Garnett to make &quot;The Save the Children Fund Film&quot;. The resulting film was unacceptable to the organization because they felt it presented their work in an unfavorable light. Eventually a legal agreement arrived at which involved the material being deposited in the National Film Archive. In 2011, roughly 42 years later, it was shown to the public for the first time.

=== Expulsion from Pakistan ===

In July 2011, the Guardian uncovered a fake vaccination program by the CIA. It then emerged that Dr. Shakil Afridi, the person organizing the CIA&#x27;s &quot;vaccinations&quot;, had claimed that he was a Save the Children employee. In May 2012, Save the Children&#x27;s country director for Pakistan, David Wright, revealed that the organization&#x27;s work had been badly disrupted ever since Afridi had made his claim, with medicines held up for long periods at airports, staff unable to get visas, and so forth. Wright also charged that the CIA had breached international humanitarian law and risked the safety of aid groups worldwide. &quot;It was a setback, no doubt,&quot; said Dr. Elias Durry, the World Health Organization&#x27;s polio coordinator for Pakistan, a few months later. Later that year, in September, it was reported that the Pakistani government had requested Save the Children&#x27;s foreign staff to leave the country, In January 2013, the Deans of twelve top US schools of public health sent a letter to President Obama protesting against the entanglement of intelligence operations in public health campaigns. The letter describes the negative and lasting impacts of the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s (CIA) use of a fake vaccination campaign in Pakistan during the hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011, which exacerbated the already persistent public mistrust of vaccines in the country.

The CIA&#x27;s &quot;vaccination program&quot; sparked a series of deadly attacks in Pakistan against dozens of aid and health workers associated with various aid and health campaigns, with the UN-backed polio-vaccination drive repeatedly halted as a result. Up to eight polio vaccination workers were assassinated in the country during this backlash. In May 2014, the Obama administration announced that they would no longer use vaccination programs as a cover for CIA activities.

Pakistani investigators said in a July 2012 report that Shakil Afridi met 25 times with &quot;foreign secret agents, received instructions and provided sensitive information to them.&quot; According to an early draft of a Pakistan Government report, which has not been publicly released, Afridi told investigators that the charity Save the Children helped facilitate his meeting with US intelligence agents although the charity denies the charge. The report alleges that Save the Children&#x27;s Pakistan director at the time of the incident introduced Afridi to a Western woman in Islamabad and that Afridi and the woman met regularly afterward.

On 11 June 2015, Pakistani authorities ordered all Save the Children workers to leave Pakistan within 15 days, and the organisation&#x27;s office in Islamabad was closed and padlocked. This saga has led to a high degree of distrust and scepticism against the validity of COVID-19 vaccines in Pakistan.

=== Complaints of inappropriate behaviour ===
The chief strategist of Save the Children UK Brendan Cox resigned in September 2015 over allegations of &quot;inappropriate behaviour&quot;. The charity temporarily suspended bids for government funds due to the scandal. Cox had previously denied any wrongdoing but finally admitted to inappropriate behaviour on 18 February 2018 and quit working for his two other charities.

On 5 March 2020, the Charity Commission published an investigation report that found there had been serious weaknesses in Save the Children&#x27;s workplace culture, following a probe into the charity&#x27;s response to allegations of misconduct and harassment against staff between 2012 and 2015. There were five complaints of sexual harassment and thirteen of bullying between 2016 and June 2018. Save the Children UK chief executive Justin Forsyth had three complaints of misconduct directed towards him by female staff, while Brendan Cox was publicly accused of sexual assault. The charity trustees had not been sent copies of an external report on corporate culture. Since then the charity has strengthened reporting and whistle-blowing policies that now permit anonymous staff complaints.

On 22 February 2018 Forsyth resigned from UNICEF to avoid damage to the charities.

On 11 September 2020, it was announced the charity could resume bids for government funding.

=== Logo font by Eric Gill ===
On 15 January 2022, it was announced that Save the Children would change the typeface in its logo, Gill Sans, due to its authorship in the 1920s by British artist Eric Gill, who was posthumously revealed to have documented the sexual abuse of his young daughters, an incestuous relationship with his sister and sexual experiments with his dog. An anonymous source told &quot;The Times&quot; that the organization had been previously warned of the typeface&#x27;s origin before its adoption, and that the decision to change it was made one year prior. The organization effectively changed its logo that same year.

===Allegations of bias in Gaza Conflict Response===
Save the Children faced criticism from staff and observers over perceived bias and institutional racism during the Gaza crisis. Senior staff members denounced the organization for prioritizing Israeli hostages&#x27; concerns over the humanitarian crisis affecting Palestinian children in Gaza Strip in a widely shared internal letter. They accused the organization of failing to recognize Arab children amid ongoing violence and spoke about structural issues, including a lack of diversity among leadership and accusing them of a neo-colonial approach to aid. In response to the letter, Save the Children CEO Inger Ashing acknowledged the &quot;long-standing issues&quot; of diversity, equity and inclusion. More than 120 Save the Children staff in Palestine released an open letter accusing leadership of suppressing advocacy for Palestinian children to appease influential stakeholders. They cited incidents of censorship, including restrictions on addressing violations by Israeli forces during a deadly military operation in Gaza. Save the Children leadership defended the global sign-off policy as a standard applied to all conflict. 

===Allegations of institutional racism===
Save the Children has faced allegations of institutional racism. Critics have pointed to a lack of diversity among leadership roles and decision-making bodies, with concerns that the functional leads responsible for designing the restructuring processes were predominantly from the Global North and lacked representation reflective of the organization&#x27;s diverse workforce and the communities it serves. While Save the Children implemented measures such as diverse selection panels and DEI training, staff expressed skepticism about the authenticity and impact of these initiatives. In September 2024, the organization released a new global salary scale that was widely criticized for containing perceived systemic biases. These salary proposals were characterized as &quot;inherently racist&quot; by staff, citing stark disparities between pay for roles in the Global North and Global South. For example, comparable roles in Belgium and Sri Lanka were assigned vastly different pay scales, with the latter being far below local living standards and in some cases even below national minimum wages. National contract holders allegedly received no severance packages at all while employees in wealthier nations were offered more substantial redundancy terms.

== Jalalabad terror attack ==
On 24 January 2018, militants affiliated with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province launched a bomb and gun attack on a Save the Children office in Jalalabad, a city in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, killing six people and injuring 27.

==Murder of Hisham Al-Hakimi==
In September 2023, Hisham Al-Hakimi, the Safety and Security Director at Save the Children office in Yemen, was arrested by Houthi movement members and kept incommunicado. He died from torture on 25 October 2023 while still being held in arbitrary detention. Investigative journalists have alleged that there was a deliberate negligence by Save the Children’s regional director Ekin Ogutogullari regarding Al-Hakimi’s whistleblowing on alleged ties of the Country Director Rama Hansraj to Houthi groups. Save the Children terminated contracts for both Ekin Ogutogullari and Rama Hansraj. A group of humanitarian agencies including Save the Children called for investigation.

== Save the Children Global Ventures (SCGV) ==
In 2022, Save the Children launched Save the Children Global Ventures (SCGV), a charitable foundation incorporated in Switzerland. SCGV&#x27;s purpose is to catalyze private sector investment through impact investing and other innovative financial approaches to transform the lives of the world&#x27;s most vulnerable children.

SCGV is a credited contributor to the Child-Lens Investment Framework released by UNICEF in 2023. In 2023, SCGV was announced as a contributor to a USAID Catalyze EduFinance&#x27;s initiative to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood development in South Africa.

<text>Pope Conon (; died 21 September 687) was the bishop of Rome from 21 October 686 to his death. He had been put forward as a compromise candidate, there being a conflict between the two factions resident in Rome — the military and the clerical. He consecrated the Irish missionary St Kilian and commissioned him to preach in Franconia.

== Background==
According to the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot;, Conon was a Greek, the son of an officer from the Thracesian Theme. He was educated in Sicily, where his father may have been posted during the stay of Constans II, and was later ordained a priest at Rome. He may have been among the many Sicilian clergy in Rome, at that time, due to Muslim raids on Sicily in the mid-7th century.

==Papacy==

Conon&#x27;s age, venerable appearance, and simple character caused the clergy and soldiery of Rome, who were in disagreement, to put aside their respective candidates and to elect him as pope. Andrew J. Ekonomou says that due to an &quot;increasing influx&quot; of Easterners into Rome at that time, that the Syrian, Greek, and Greco-Sicilian population together outnumbered the Latins. This would also have increased Conon&#x27;s electability. Conon was consecrated on 21 October 686 after notice of his election had been sent to the exarch of Ravenna, or after it had been confirmed by him.

Conon received the Irish missionaries Kilian and his companions, consecrated Kilian bishop, and commissioned him and the others to preach the faith in Franconia. (Vita S. Kiliani, in Canisius, Lect. Antiquæ, III, 175–180.) He was in favour with Emperor Justinian II, who informed him that he had recovered the Acts of the Third Council of Constantinople, by which, the emperor wrote, it was his intention to abide. Justinian also remitted certain taxes and dues owing to the imperial exchequer from several papal patrimonies.

Conon was buried in the Patriarchal Basilica of St. Peter.

<doc id="436890" wikidata="Q471428" url="?curid=436890" title="John Shalikashvili">
<text>John Malchase David Shalikashvili (, ; 27 June 1936 – 23 July 2011) was a United States Army general who served as Supreme Allied Commander Europe from 1992 to 1993 and the 13th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997. He was born in Warsaw, Poland, in the family of émigré Georgian officer Dimitri Shalikashvili and his naturalized-Polish wife Maria Rüdiger-Belyaeva. In 1996, he was the first recipient of the Naval War College Distinguished Graduate Leadership Award.

Shalikashvili was the first, and as of 2023 only, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff not born in the United States. He served in every level of unit command from platoon to division. Shalikashvili died of a stroke in 2011 at the age of 75.

==Early life and education==
Shalikashvili was a scion of the medieval Georgian noble house of Shalikashvili. His father, Prince Dimitri Shalikashvili (1896–1978), born in Gurjaani, served in the army of Imperial Russia and his wife, Countess Maria Rüdiger-Belyaeva. Dimitri was a grandson of Russian general Dmitry Staroselsky.

After the Bolshevik Revolution, Dimitri became a lieutenant colonel in the army of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. When the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Georgia in 1921, Dimitri was on diplomatic service in Turkey. Dimitri then joined other Georgian exiles in Poland, where he met and married John&#x27;s mother, Maria; she was Polish and of part German ancestry, and the daughter of Count Rudiger-Bielajew (Rüdiger-Belyaev), a former Tsarist general. They had three children: Othar, John and Gale. Dimitri served in the Polish Army (along with other Georgian exiles) as a contract officer.

In 1939, the elder Shalikashvili fought against the German invasion of Poland. After the Polish defeat, Dimitri was demobilized. In 1941, he enlisted in the Georgian Legion, a force of ethnic Georgians recruited by Germany to fight against the Soviet Union. The unit was later incorporated into the SS-Waffengruppe Georgien and transferred to Normandy. Dimitri surrendered to British forces and was a prisoner of war until after the war. A collection of Dimitri Shalikashvili&#x27;s writings are on deposit at the Hoover Institution.
Meanwhile, Maria, John and his two brothers lived through the destruction of Warsaw. As the Red Army approached Warsaw in 1944, the family fled to Pappenheim, Germany, being reunited with Dimitri along the way. It was in Pappenheim in the closing days of World War II that John first laid eyes on U.S. soldiers. His family stayed with relatives there in Pappenheim for eight years.

In 1952, when Shalikashvili was 16, the family emigrated to the US, and settled in Peoria, Illinois. They were sponsored by Winifred Luthy, the wife of a local banker, who was previously married to Dimitri&#x27;s cousin. The Luthys and the Episcopal Church helped the Shalikashvili family get started, finding jobs and a home for them. Dimitri worked for Ameren, and Maria was a file clerk at Commercial National Bank. When Shalikashvili arrived in Peoria he spoke little English:

Shalikashvili went to Peoria High School, where he was a long-distance runner. He attended Bradley University in Peoria and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering in 1958. He was a member of Theta Chi. In 1970, Shalikashvili received a master&#x27;s degree in international affairs from the George Washington University&#x27;s School of International Affairs.

In May 1958, Shalikashvili and his family became U.S. citizens. It was the first nationality he ever held. He had previously been classified as stateless because he had been born to parents who had been refugees.

==Military career==

After graduation Shalikashvili had planned to work for Hyster, but received a draft notice in July 1958. He entered the United States Army as a private, enjoyed it, and applied to the Army&#x27;s Officer Candidate School. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1959.

Shalikashvili served in various Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery positions as a platoon leader, forward observer, instructor, and student, in various staff positions, and as a battery commander. He served in the Vietnam War in Quang Tri Province with Advisory Team 4 (redesignated Team 19 in September, 1968), Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), as a senior district advisor from 1968 to 1969. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal with &quot;V&quot; for heroism during his Vietnam tour. Immediately after his Vietnam service, he attended the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.

In 1970, Shalikashvili became executive officer of the 2nd Battalion, 18th Field Artillery at Fort Lewis, Washington. Later in 1975, he commanded the 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery, 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis. In 1977, he attended the U.S. Army War College and served as the Commander of Division Artillery (DIVARTY) for the 1st Armored Division in Germany. He later became the assistant division commander. In 1987, Shalikashvili commanded the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis. There he oversaw a &quot;high technology test bed&quot; tasked to integrate three brigades—one heavy armor, one light infantry, and one &quot;experimental mechanized&quot;—into a new type of fighting force.

Shalikashvili achieved real distinction with his considerable success as the commander of Operation Provide Comfort, the peacekeeping and humanitarian activity in northern Iraq after the Gulf War. This assignment involved intense and complex negotiations with the Turkish government, and tough face-to-face meetings with the Iraqi military. Another important achievement was the establishment of the Joint Vision 2010 program, which would transfer the United States military into one great and effective digitalized military force.

Shalikashvili was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, effective October 25. During the 1995-96 Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, he commanded the US Navy to assist in the defense of Taiwan.

He retired from the Army in September 1997, after serving for 38 years.

==Later life and death==

Shalikashvili was an advisor to John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 Presidential campaign. He was a visiting professor at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. He served as a director of Russell Investments, L-3 Communications, Inc., Plug Power Inc., United Defense, Inc., the Initiative for Global Development, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.

Shalikashvili was married to Joan and had one son, Brant, a graduate of Washington State University, and a daughter, Debra.

Shalikashvili suffered a severe stroke on 7 August 2004 that paralyzed his left side.

In 2006 the National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR) launched the John M. Shalikashvili Chair in National Security Studies to recognize Shalikashvili for his years of military service and for his leadership on NBR&#x27;s Board of Directors.

In 2007, Shalikashvili penned an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling for a reversal of Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell. A similar op-ed by him appeared in the 19 June 2009, issue of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The policy was reversed 22 July 2011, the day before his death.

Shalikashvili died at the age of 75 on 23 July 2011, at the Madigan Army Medical Center in Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, from a stroke. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

The first biography on Shalikashvili, &quot;Boy on the Bridge: The Story of John Shalikashvili&#x27;s American Success,&quot; was published by the University Press of Kentucky in conjunction with the Association of the U.S. Army in October 2019.

<text>Žarko Dolinar (3 July 1920 – 9 March 2003) was a Croatian biologist and table tennis player who won eight medals at the World Table Tennis Championships.

He was born in a family of Slovene economic immigrants to Croatia. In 1939, at the age of 18 he became the national champion of Yugoslavia. Dolinar was champion of the Independent State of Croatia multiple times, and also competed for its national team on nine occasions.

He also won three English Open titles.

Dolinar is one of few world sporting champions with a Ph.D. degree. He graduated from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1949, and received a doctorate in 1959. He was world doubles champion with his partner, Vilim Harangozo. Dolinar was also head of the Sports Science Committee for the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).

A university professor in both Zagreb and Basel, Dolinar and his brother Boris were honored as the Righteous Among the Nations for saving Jews during World War II. On a number of occasions, the Dolinar brothers provided Jews with forged identity documents and travel permits, used their connections to have them released from imprisonment, and helped them travel to safety.

In 2016, Dolinar was inducted into the European Table Tennis Hall of Fame.

<doc id="436896" wikidata="Q52707770" url="?curid=436896" title="Tarantula hawk">
<text>A tarantula hawk is a spider wasp (Pompilidae) that preys on tarantulas. Tarantula hawks belong to any of the many species in the genera &quot;Pepsis&quot; and &quot;Hemipepsis.&quot; They are one of the largest parasitoid wasps, using their sting to paralyze their prey before dragging it into a brood nest as living food; a single egg is laid on the prey, hatching to a larva which eats the still-living host. They are found on all continents other than Europe and Antarctica.

==Description==
These wasps grow up to long, making them among the largest of wasps, and have blue-black bodies and bright, rust-colored wings (other species have black wings with blue highlights). The vivid coloration found on their bodies, and especially wings, is aposematic, advertising to potential predators the wasps&#x27; ability to deliver a powerful sting. Their long legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female &quot;Pepsis grossa&quot; can be up to long, and the powerful sting is considered one of the most painful insect stings in the world.

==Behavior==
The female tarantula hawk wasp stings a tarantula between the legs, paralyzing it, and then drags the prey to a specially prepared burrow, where a single egg is laid on the spider&#x27;s abdomen, and the burrow entrance is covered. Sex of offspring is determined by fertilization; fertilized eggs produce females, while unfertilized eggs produce males. When the wasp larva hatches, it creates a small hole in the spider&#x27;s abdomen, then enters and feeds voraciously, avoiding vital organs for as long as possible to keep the spider alive. After several weeks, the larva pupates. Finally, the wasp becomes an adult and emerges from the spider&#x27;s abdomen to continue the life cycle.

Adult tarantula hawks are nectarivorous. While the wasps tend to be most active in the daytime in summer, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt. Both males and females feed on the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees. Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. The males can become resident defenders of the favorable reproduction spots for hours into the afternoon. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.

==Distribution==
Worldwide distribution of tarantula hawks includes areas from India to Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, with the genus &quot;Pepsis&quot; entirely restricted to the New World. In the latter, &quot;Pepsis&quot; species have been observed from as far north as Logan, Utah and south as far as Argentina, with at least 250 species living in South America. Eighteen species of &quot;Pepsis&quot; and three species of &quot;Hemipepsis&quot; are found in the United States, primarily in the deserts of the southwestern United States, with &quot;Pepsis grossa&quot; (formerly &quot;Pepsis formosa&quot;) and &quot;Pepsis thisbe&quot; being common. The two species are difficult to distinguish, but the majority of &quot;P. grossa&quot; have metallic blue bodies and reddish antennae, which separates them from &quot;P. thisbe&quot;. Both species have bright orange wings that become transparent near the tip.

==Sting==
Tarantula hawk wasps are relatively docile and rarely sting without provocation. However, the sting—particularly that of &quot;P. grossa&quot;—is among the most painful of all insects, though the intense pain only lasts about five minutes. One researcher described the pain as &quot;...immediate, excruciating, unrelenting pain that simply shuts down one&#x27;s ability to do anything, except scream. Mental discipline simply does not work in these situations.&quot; In terms of scale, the wasp&#x27;s sting is rated near the top of the Schmidt sting pain index, second only to that of the bullet ant, and is described by Schmidt as &quot;blinding, fierce[, and] shockingly electric&quot;. Because of their extremely large stingers, very few animals are able to eat them; one of the few that can is the roadrunner. Many predatory animals avoid these wasps, and many different insects mimic them, including various other wasps and bees (Müllerian mimics), as well as moths, flies (e.g., mydas flies), and beetles (e.g., &quot;Tragidion&quot;) (Batesian mimics).

Aside from the possibility of triggering an allergic reaction, the sting is not dangerous and does not require medical attention. Local redness appears in most cases after the pain, and lasts for up to a week.

==State insect of New Mexico==
The U.S. state of New Mexico chose a species of tarantula hawk (specifically, &quot;P. formosa&quot;, now known as &quot;P. grossa&quot;) in 1989 to become its official state insect. Its selection was prompted by a group of elementary school children from Edgewood doing research on states that had adopted state insects. They selected three insects as candidates and mailed ballots to all schools for a statewide election. The winner was the tarantula hawk wasp.

<text>U.S. Route 40 or U.S. Highway 40 (US 40), also known as the Main Street of America (a nickname shared with U.S. Route 66), is a major east–west United States Highway traveling across the United States from the Mountain States to the Mid-Atlantic States. As with most routes whose numbers end in a zero, US 40 once traversed the entire United States. It is one of the first U.S. Highways created in 1926 and its original termini were in San Francisco, California, and Atlantic City, New Jersey. US 40 currently ends at a junction with I-80 in Silver Summit, Utah, just outside Salt Lake City. West of this point US 40 was functionally replaced with I-80, and as these segments of I-80 were constructed the western portion of US 40 was truncated several times.

Starting at its western terminus in Utah, US 40 crosses a total of 12 states, including Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. US 40 passes through or by major cities including Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, Baltimore, and Wilmington. Three former and four current state capitals lie along the route. For much of its route, US 40 runs parallel to or concurrently with several major Interstate Highways: I-70 from Denver, Colorado, to Washington, Pennsylvania; and again from Hancock, Maryland to Baltimore; I-64 in parts of Missouri and Illinois; I-68 along the Maryland Panhandle; and I-95 from Baltimore to New Castle, Delaware.

The route was built on top of several older highways, most notably the National Road and the Victory Highway. The National Road was created in 1806 by an act of Congress to serve as the first federally funded highway construction project. When completed it connected Cumberland, Maryland, with Vandalia, Illinois. The Victory Highway was designated as a memorial to World War I veterans and ran from Kansas City, Missouri to San Francisco. Other important roads that have become part of US 40 include Zane&#x27;s Trace in Ohio, Braddock Road in Maryland and Pennsylvania, part of the Black Horse Pike in New Jersey, part of the Oregon Trail in Kansas, and the Lincoln Highway throughout most of California.

===Utah===
The western terminus of US 40 is in Silver Summit, Utah at an interchange with Interstate 80, several miles north of Park City, at Silver Creek Junction. The road is concurrent with US 189 until it has reached Heber City. US 40 is a limited access highway from the I-80 junction to its intersection with Utah State Route 32 (SR-32), approximately south of Park City. From there, the road takes a generally southerly course to Heber City. In Heber City, there is an intersection with SR-113. One mile later, US 189 splits off. There are no more major intersections until US 40 has reached Fruitland, as it meets SR-208. About 18 miles later, the road enters Duchesne. In Duchesne, it meets US 191 and SR-87. US 40 passes Duchesne and starts a concurrency. The concurrency continues into Roosevelt, Fort Duchesne and Vernal. In Roosevelt, it meets SR-87 again in a five-point intersection. There are two intersections with SR-121, in Roosevelt and Vernal. In Fort Duchesne, there is an intersection with SR-88. After US 40 passes Vernal, US 191 splits off and the concurrency ends. After that, there are no more major intersections until US 40 reaches Naples, as it meets SR-45. About later, US 40 enters Jensen. In Jensen, there is an intersection with SR-149. About later, the road enters Colorado.

===Colorado===
US 40 enters Colorado, west of Dinosaur. In Dinosaur, there is an intersection with Colorado State Highway 64. After passing Dinosaur, there are no more major intersections until US 40 reaches Maybell, as it meets with Colorado State Highway 318. 30 miles later, the road enters Craig. In Craig, US 40 starts a very short concurrency with State Highway 13 (SR 13). After Craig, SH 13 splits off. The road then passes through Hayden without major intersections. Then it exits Hayden and enters Steamboat Springs. There is an intersection with SH 131 and SH 14. US 40 then continues southeast into Kremmling. In Kremmling, there is an intersection with SH 134 and SH 9. It then exits Kremmling and enters Granby. There is an intersection with US 34. The road then passes Fraser and Winter Park without major intersections. About later, US 40 starts a concurrency with I-70. About later, I-70 splits off. s later, it is concurrent again. later, I-70 splits off again. After the second concurrency with I-70, US 40 enters Denver.

The road passes through downtown Denver on Colfax Avenue, and has intersections with SH 391, SH 121, SH 95, and SH 2 and an interchange with US 287. The route through Denver also serves as the business loop for I-70. East of Denver, US 40 passes through Aurora and becomes concurrent with I-70 once again. later, it enters Limon. In Limon, I-70 splits off, however the road is still concurrent with US 287. There is an intersection with SH 71. US 40 then passes Hugo without major intersections. In Wild Horse, it meets SH 94. About later, the road enters Kit Carson. There is an intersection with SH 59. After Kit Carson, US 287 splits off and the concurrency ends. After that, there are no more major intersections until US 40 reaches Cheyenne Wells, as it meets US 385 in an interchange. The road then passes Arapahoe without major intersections. later, US 40 enters Kansas.

===Kansas===
US 40 enters Kansas near the unincorporated community of Weskan. The first sizable town it enters is Sharon Springs, where it intersects K-27. From there it goes northeast to Oakley and follows Eagle Eye Road before merging with I-70 east of town. The two routes remain merged until Topeka, although the prior alignment of US 40, named Old Highway 40, parallels I-70 for most of the way. From Ellsworth to Salina, the old alignment of US 40 is signed as K-140.

In Topeka, US 40 leaves I-70 at exit 366, follows the Oakland Expressway concurrent with K-4 north to 6th Avenue, then heads east along 6th Avenue out of town. Through Topeka, US 40 closely follows the route of the Oregon Trail. At the Shawnee-Douglas county line near Big Springs, US 40 crosses to the south of I-70 and enters Lawrence from the west along West 6th Street. At the west side of Lawrence, the route is joined by K-10 and travels south and east to the junction with US 59 and then runs north with US 59 to cross the Kansas River. It follows North 2nd and North 3rd Streets, crosses back under I-70, leaves US 59, and merges with US 24 before leaving town.

US 40 remains merged with US 24 as the two routes travel northeast to the town of Tonganoxie. From there, the merged routes turn due east toward Kansas City, Kansas. In Kansas City, US 40 and US 24 intersect US 73 and K-7, and turn south toward Interstate 70. US 40, along with US 24, then merge onto I-70 and recross the Kansas River over the Lewis and Clark Viaduct just before entering Kansas City, Missouri.

On December 1, 2008, US 40, along with US 24 and US 73, was rerouted south along K-7 west of Kansas City to the intersection with I-70. Before this date, US 40 and US 24 continued along State Avenue to College Parkway before turning right to follow Turner Diagonal for where US 40 joined Interstate 70 for the duration of its journey eastward toward Missouri.

In 1951, the State of Kansas designated U.S. Route 40 as a Blue Star Memorial Highway from border to border.

===Missouri===

US 40 enters Missouri in Kansas City along a concurrency with I-70. It leaves I-70 at exit 7A. US 40 parallels I-70 to the north through Kansas City until exit 11, where it crosses and parallels it to the south through the suburbs of Independence, Lee&#x27;s Summit, Blue Springs, and Grain Valley before it rejoins I-70 at exit 24. An older alignment carries the designation &quot;Old US 40&quot;.

US 40 stays with I-70 until it reaches Boonville, where it leaves at exit 101, along with Business Loop 70. Both designations follow Ashley Road, before US 40 leaves and heads north along Main Street. After crossing the Missouri River in Boonville, US 40 turns east before rejoining I-70 again at exit 121 on the outskirts of Columbia. The two routes remain concurrent until exit 210A in Wentzville.

From Wentzville, US 40 now joins a concurrency with I-64 and US 61 and heads southeast, crossing the Missouri River again over the Daniel Boone Bridge in St. Charles. US 40 stays joined with I-64 and leaves the state in St. Louis on the Poplar Street Bridge across the Mississippi River, along with I-64 and I-55.

Until 1926, US 40 in Missouri was Route 2.

On January 2, 2008, five miles (8 km) of the route in St. Louis was closed both eastbound and westbound from I-170 to I-270. It re-opened December 15, 2008 two weeks ahead of the originally scheduled date of December 31, 2008. On December 13, 2008, another five-mile (8 km) section of the freeway closed both ways from I-170 to the Kingshighway exit in the city. It was re-opened on December 7, 2009. The entire freeway is now open for travel, with the speed limit raised to 60 mph on most of the stretch. It is also now a full freeway all the way from Downtown St. Louis to Wentzville. When complete, the entire new freeway was signed as Interstate 64.

===Illinois===
The next of US 40 lie within the state of Illinois. Except where the route has been re-aligned with Interstate 70, it is an entirely undivided surface route. Formerly a major highway, it has lost most of its non-local traffic to Interstate 70. Some early bypasses of towns were built with the apparent intention of twinning them as a divided highway with access limited to intersections. I-70 uses none of those old bypasses that remain as sections of US 40. The westernmost portion of the historic National Road lies on most of the US 40 alignment in Illinois.

US 40 crosses into Illinois at East St. Louis on the Poplar Street Bridge concurrent with I-55/I-64. The route has a close relationship with I-70 for the remainder of the time it spends in the state, being directly concurrent with or paralleling it throughout Illinois.

Between Pocahontas and Mulberry Grove, US 40 passes through several small towns. In Vandalia, Illinois, the former state capitol, it follows Veterans Avenue and Kennedy Boulevard (with US 51) through town. The Old State House in Vandalia marks the western terminus of the National Road, one of the earliest roads upon which US 40 was designated. From Vandalia, the road continues to the northeast passing through the early German settlement town of Teutopolis and several city streets in Effingham. Beyond Effingham, US 40 passes through many small unincorporated towns before leaving the state near Marshall.

===Indiana===

US 40 enters Indiana from the west at unincorporated Liggett along with I-70. US 40 leaves the interstate at exit 11 and heads north through the east side of Terre Haute with SR 46. The road leaves the city to the northeast upon reaching Wabash Avenue.
Upon leaving Terre Haute, US 40 passes through the small towns of Seelyville, Brazil, Knightsville and Harmony. Between Seelyville and Brazil, the road bypasses several small unincorporated communities which are served by State Road 340, a former alignment of US 40. The road continues to the northeast beyond Harmony, passing many unincorporated places such as Reelsville, Pleasant Gardens, Manhattan, Putnamville, Mount Meridian, Stilesville and Belleville along the way to Plainfield, a suburb of Indianapolis.

In Plainfield, US 40 is Main Street and passes The Shops at Perry Crossing and a nostalgic stainless steel diner. Upon leaving Plainfield, US 40 becomes Washington Street, where it passes by the northern edge of Indianapolis International Airport. After passing the airport, US 40 is now routed onto Interstate 465 Southbound on the west side of Indianapolis. A sign along the entrance ramp advises motorists &quot;For US 40 East, Follow I-465 South to Exit 46.&quot; This route bypasses downtown Indianapolis and instead goes through the southern part of Indianapolis; its nearest point is about south of the city center. (Previously, the highway did not join with I-465 but continued along Washington Street, where it entered Indianapolis proper near Eagle Creek, a tributary of the White River. In downtown Indianapolis, the old highway crossed White River on a bridge that is now pedestrian-only and part of White River State Park and north of the current Indianapolis Zoo. The new alignment diverts at White River Parkway W. Drive and rejoins the original route at the Indiana State Museum; the length of US 40 replaced is about .9 of a mile. The new alignment included the diversion to create White River State Park, and split into a pair of one-way streets: Washington Street carries westbound traffic and Maryland Street carries eastbound traffic. Originally US 40 was a 2-way street all through town. In Indianapolis, the old highway passes several key landmarks, including White River State Park, the Indianapolis Zoo, the Indiana State Museum, the Eiteljorg Museum, Victory Field, the Lucas Oil Stadium, and the Indiana Statehouse.) Along the eastern edge of Indianapolis, US 40 leaves I-465 at Exit 46 and is once again routed onto Washington Street.

East of Indianapolis, US 40 enters Cumberland where it takes the name National Road. Paralleling I-70 at a distance of about , US 40 continues eastward across Indiana, passing through such communities as Greenfield, Knightstown, Lewisville, Straughn, Dublin, Mount Auburn, and Cambridge City, where it is known by various local names including Washington Street, Main Street, and National Road.

Note: Just east of Knightstown, cross the Big Blue River, on the right is part of the old National Road. This section is about 4.3 miles long and rejoins US 40 in Dunreith.

US 40&#x27;s last stop in Indiana is the city of Richmond. In Richmond, it passes a statue known as &quot;Madonna of the Trail&quot;, one of a series of twelve statues across the U.S. that memorialize women pioneers who made the trek to settle the western U.S. In 1968, a section of US 40 (Main Street) in Richmond was destroyed by a massive gas explosion. This caused a section of Main Street to be closed to automobile traffic, and US 40 was rerouted along North A Street (westbound) and South A Street (eastbound). Near the Indiana/Ohio border, US 40 crosses I-70 at exit 156B before entering Ohio.

===Ohio===


US 40 enters Ohio just to the south of New Paris. The road is always close to the newer I-70 eastward toward Dayton. In Vandalia, the road passes to the south of Dayton International Airport and crosses the Dixie Highway and I-75 and the Great Miami River. The road never actually enters Dayton, instead skirting the northern suburbs on the way toward Springfield.

The portion of US 40 between Medway-Carlisle Road (Ohio State Route 571/County Road 303) and Lammes Lane in Bethel Township, Clark County, is designated &quot;Staff Sergeant Wesley Williams Memorial Highway&quot;, in honor of a 2005 Tecumseh High School graduate who died on December 10, 2012, while serving in the U.S. Army, from injuries suffered when enemy forces attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.

In Springfield, US 40 is split between two one-way streets. North Street carries US 40 West and Columbia Street carries US 40 East. The route then shifts on to East Main Street before leaving town to the east, once again as National Road. From Tuttle Road just east of Springfield to state route 54 in South Vienna US 40 has been designated as the Deputy Matthew Yates Memorial Highway. Yates was killed inside a trailer on July 24, 2022, at Harmony Estates MHP as he responded to a report of a shooting. I-70 crosses again at unincorporated Harmony. US 40 passes just north of London where it intersects Ohio State Route 56 and US 42 before heading into West Jefferson. In West Jefferson, US 40 is routed on Main Street.

In the Columbus metropolitan area, US 40 enters from the west as Broad Street. Among the sites along US 40 in Columbus are the Ohio Statehouse, the Columbus Museum of Art, and LeVeque Tower, the oldest skyscraper in Columbus. In Bexley, the route follows Main Street, using Drexel Avenue to get between Broad and Main. US 40 continues as Main Street through Reynoldsburg before leaving the Columbus area as National Road yet again.

East of the Columbus metro area, US 40 parallels I-70 at a distance of about , passing through several small towns, including Kirkersville, and Hebron. In Zanesville, the road becomes Main Street, and at the center of town US 40 begins a concurrency with US 22 that carries it to Cambridge. US 40 crosses the Muskingum River in Zanesville on the famous Y-Bridge. Routes 22 and 40 enter Cambridge from the southwest along John Glenn Highway, and split in town; US 40 follows Wheeling Avenue. In Old Washington, US 40 joins I-70 at Exit 186. It leaves I-70 at exit 201 near Morristown. The two roads cross paths several times before they both leave Ohio on a pair of bridges across the Ohio River at Bridgeport.

The now-decommissioned Ohio State Route 440 ran along old US 40 in places where US 40 had been shifted onto I-70.

===West Virginia===

US 40 is only long as it passes through West Virginia, mainly through Wheeling, where it briefly runs concurrent with both I-70 and US Route 250. It diverges from I-70 east of the Fort Henry Bridge and into the northern section on the downtown Wheeling area, where it meets with the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, which was the former link for the National Road.

It then turns twice left and passes over I-70 and Wheeling Hill, past McColloch&#x27;s Leap, and into the Wheeling suburbs. It intersects WV Route 88 halfway through this leg of US 40, and the southbound leg of WV 88 runs concurrent with US 40 at this point until it reaches Elm Grove, where US 40 turns left and heads into Tridelphia and Valley Grove before reaching the Pennsylvania state line.

===Pennsylvania===
US 40 enters Pennsylvania at West Alexander. It closely parallels I-70 from West Virginia until it reaches Washington where it follows Chestnut St, Jefferson Avenue and Maiden Street. In Washington, US 40 passes to the south of Washington &amp; Jefferson College. Following Maiden Street out of town, the road turns southeast toward the town of California. A short limited access highway in California and West Brownsville provides an approach to the Lane Bane Bridge across the Monongahela River. From here, the road continues southeast to Uniontown.

US 40 bypasses Uniontown along a limited access highway that also carries US 119. An old alignment through Uniontown is signed as &quot;Business US 40.&quot; Southeast of Uniontown, travellers pass the Fort Necessity National Battlefield. It follows Braddock Road southeast of Uniontown, crossing the Youghiogheny River Lake on a bridge completed in 2006. US 40 leaves Pennsylvania near Addison

===Maryland===

US 40 enters Maryland from Pennsylvania near Grantsville in the western part of the state. Here, and through most of the state, it is known as National Pike. US 40 leaves National Pike shortly after entering Maryland from the northwest and merges with I-68 and US 219 at exit 14B. The old alignment of US 40, still known as National Pike, is signed through much of the western part of the state as either &quot;Scenic US 40&quot; or &quot;Alternate US 40&quot;. US 219 leaves the three-way concurrency at exit 22, but US 40 and I-68 remain on the same pavement through Frostburg and Cumberland.

East of Cumberland, the old National Pike (formerly US 40) carries the MD 144 designation. The I-68/US 40 roadway passes through a deep cut in Sideling Hill. Just to the east of the cut is the Sideling Hill Exhibit Center, a museum that highlights Western Maryland geology. At Hancock, where the state of Maryland narrows to less than two miles (3 km) wide, I-68 ends, and US 40 merges onto I-70 at exit 1. The two routes closely follow the course of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Potomac River for several miles before US 40 leaves the Interstate at exit 9. US 40 passes directly through the center of Hagerstown using Washington Avenue (eastbound) and Franklin Street (westbound). Here, it intersects I-81 and has an intersection with US 11. Heading southeast out of Hagerstown, US 40 diverges into two separate routes, US 40 and US 40 Alt. US 40 parallels I-70, its longtime travel partner, crossing it at exit 32 near Greenbrier State Park on the Baltimore National Pike alignment. US 40 Alt heads southeast on the Old National Pike alignment through Boonsboro, crossing South Mountain at Turner&#x27;s Gap. The two routes converge just west of Frederick.
In Frederick, US 40 uses Patrick Street before merging onto the US 15 expressway for a short distance. It leaves US 15 and rejoins I-70 on the outskirts of Frederick. MD 144 once again takes over the old alignment of US 40.

US 40 leaves I-70 for the final time upon entering the western suburbs of Baltimore, once again as Baltimore National Pike. The route passes through Patapsco Valley State Park north of Ellicott City and enters the Baltimore city limits along Edmondson Avenue. East of Gwynns Falls Leakin Park, US 40 becomes Franklin Street, and becomes an expressway (formerly I-170) for a short distance between Pulaski Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Through this area, an alignment called &quot;Truck US 40&quot; diverts larger vehicles onto an alternate route. US 40 passes through the Mount Vernon neighborhood and a few blocks from Baltimore&#x27;s Washington Monument. After crossing the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83), US 40 follows Orleans Street, and finally becomes the Pulaski Highway as it leaves Baltimore to the northeast.

US 40, for the entire length of Pulaski Highway, closely parallels I-95. Pulaski Highway passes through Gunpowder Falls State Park near Joppa and the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Between Havre de Grace and Perryville it crosses the Susquehanna River on the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge. US 40 leaves Maryland in Elkton, crossing the border into Delaware.

===Delaware===

US 40 crosses Delaware for about . Entering the state from Maryland in Glasgow, it continues along the Pulaski Highway. Much roadside commercial development slows traffic, as there are many traffic lights along the route. US 40 has an interchange with Delaware Route 1 in the community of Bear before merging with US 13 (Dupont Highway) in State Road. The concurrent routes turn north, pass the Wilmington Airport and US 40 splits to join I-295 near Wilmington Manor. US 40, along with I-295, uses the Delaware Memorial Bridge to cross the Delaware River into New Jersey.

===New Jersey===
US 40 enters New Jersey in Deepwater, New Jersey along with I-295. US 40 briefly joins the New Jersey Turnpike, and exits to the north of the toll booths. The route follows Wiley Road, parallel to the Turnpike, before joining Harding Highway in Carneys Point. US 40 is known as the Harding Highway through most of South Jersey. Northeast of it convergence with US 40, Harding Highway carries the Route 48 designation, although this was once part of US 40 as well.

US 40 enters the borough of Woodstown as a concurrency with Route 45 along West Avenue; it leaves town heading southeast. In Upper Pittsgrove Township, the road changes names to the Pole Tavern-Elmer Road. Passing through Elmer it becomes Chestnut Street and then the Elmer-Malaga Road. In Malaga, it runs concurrent with Route 47 (Delsea Drive). The route bypasses the city of Vineland to the northeast, and becomes Cape May Avenue in Hamilton Township, where it crosses Route 50 in Mays Landing.

US 40 merges with US 322 and the Black Horse Pike in McKee City. The two routes enter Atlantic City along Albany Avenue and pass the Atlantic City Airport. US 40 and US 322 both reach their eastern terminus at the intersection of Albany Avenue and Ventnor Avenue.

==History==
===Early roads===
US 40&#x27;s history can be traced back several centuries. Several well established Native American footpaths, including Nemacolin&#x27;s Path and Mingo Path in the Maryland-Pennsylvania area, followed similar alignments to US 40. Early American colonists established roads, some following the established Native American paths, that would later serve as US 40. These included a segment of post road between Wilmington, Delaware, and Baltimore, Maryland. In 1755, during the French and Indian Wars, General Edward Braddock blazed a trail en route to capture Fort Duquesne (modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). US 40 closely follows this route between Cumberland, Maryland and Uniontown, Pennsylvania.

Early in the history of the U.S., the State of Maryland established a network of turnpikes for long-distance travel. Three of these would later serve as part of US 40: the Baltimore and Havre de Grace Turnpike, the Baltimore and Frederick Turnpike, and Bank Road. Colonel Ebenezer Zane (for whom Zanesville, Ohio was named) blazed some of the first trails across the Ohio wilderness in the last years of the 18th century. Zane&#x27;s Trace, as his road was called, stretched from Wheeling, West Virginia, to Maysville, Kentucky. With some minor alignment differences, US 40 closely matches the segment from Wheeling to Zanesville.

Between the cities of Lawrence and Topeka, Kansas, US 40 follows the path of the Oregon Trail. During the 19th century, the Oregon Trail served as a major thoroughfare for people emigrating to the Pacific Northwest. Between 1850 and 1852, some 65,000–70,000 people traveled the trail.

===National Road===

In 1806, Thomas Jefferson signed into law an act of Congress establishing a National Road to connect the waters of the Atlantic Ocean with the Ohio River. The law mentions Baltimore as its eastern terminus; but the route used established Maryland turnpikes east of Cumberland. A new road was constructed from Cumberland to Wheeling, West Virginia, and later extended across the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Segments of the National Road used Braddock&#x27;s Road and Zane&#x27;s Trace. Plans to extend the road to Missouri were never completed. The farthest western terminus for the National Road was the Old State House in Vandalia, Illinois.

The National Road was absorbed into the National Old Trails Ocean-to-Ocean highway, a route from New York, New York, to Los Angeles, California in the early 20th century. The National Road became US 40 in the original 1925 plan for U.S. Routes. To this day, many places still name US 40 &quot;National Road&quot;, even where the alignment was moved from the original road. Besides US 40, much of the National Road is paralleled by segments of Interstates 68 and 70.

===Victory Highway===

Most of the western section of US 40 follows the former route of Victory Highway, a road that once linked Kansas City to San Francisco. The road was named as a memorial to fallen World War I veterans. Other than two sections (one in California and one in Kansas/Colorado) most of the original route of US 40 west of Kansas City used Victory Highway. According to a 1926 guide published about the Victory Highway, it was the fastest route between San Francisco and Salt Lake City, allowing travellers to complete the trip &quot;comfortably and in high gear in from 3 to 4 days.&quot; Controversy over the routing of US 40 over the Victory Highway led to a &quot;divided route&quot;, with US 40S following the Victory Highway and US 40N taking a more northerly route.

===Evolution===

US 40 was one of the original 1926 U.S. Highways.

The route was a cross-country, east–west route, as most routes with a &quot;0&quot; number were defined. In 1926, the road had a total mileage of . Though the eastern terminus was planned for State Road, Delaware, by 1927 it was moved to Atlantic City, New Jersey. The western terminus was San Francisco via an auto ferry across San Francisco Bay from the Berkeley Pier in Berkeley, California. Upon completion of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, US 40 was re-routed over the bridge, bypassing the ferry pier. Early alignments of the road featured ferries at both ends. To cross the Delaware River, ferries were used, originally from Wilmington, Delaware (1927–1929) and later from New Castle, Delaware (1929–1951). In 1951, the opening of the Delaware Memorial Bridge replaced the ferry service and carried US 40 across the Delaware River.

From 1926 to 1935 the route split in Manhattan, Kansas, into &quot;40N&quot; and &quot;40S&quot; routes; the two routes met again in Limon, Colorado. The &quot;40S&quot; route continued on to Grand Junction, Colorado. In 1935, the split routes were eliminated. US 40N between Manhattan and Limon and then US 40S from Limon to Grand Junction was replaced by U.S. Route 24, the remainder was renumbered as simply US 40.

New alignments for the road were designated in Maryland in 1948 and in Utah in 1950. California&#x27;s segment of the highway was decommissioned in 1964. By 1966, the western terminus moved to Reno, Nevada. The road shortened again in 1975, to its current western end at Silver Creek Junction, Utah. In 1998, the California segment was given a sort of rebirth with the designation of Historic Route 40 through that state. Further realignments occurred in Utah where the highway was re-routed for the Jordanelle Reservoir in the mid-1990s, and Kansas City, Kansas, in 1999 to make way for the Kansas Speedway. On December 1, 2008, a further realignment in Kansas City rerouted US 40 away from State Avenue and the Turner Diagonal and onto K-7 and Interstate 70.

&quot;In 1998 [Eddie Lange] persuaded the California legislature to designate Route 40 between Reno and San Francisco as Historic Route 40.&quot; Together with Trish Gray, the duo designed the signs and a program where local businesses could donate funds to have a sign erected near their business along the route. The signs can now be found throughout the California route and is a popular route for motorcycle clubs and other travel enthusiasts.

===Historical route===

====California====
The former route of US 40 in California generally runs parallel to modern Interstate 80. 
* In Contra Costa County it is San Pablo Avenue, now signed as State Route 123 (SR 123). 
* Portions of Historic Route 40 exist in Vallejo, along 5th Street, Alameda Street and Broadway. 
* North of Vallejo the route goes up American Canyon
* In Cordelia and Suisun City, the original route is along Cordelia Road. It is also signed as a historic route. An older alignment runs north of Cordelia Road on Pittman Road, across I-80 where it turns into Suisun Valley Road and then turns east on Rockville Road where it crosses I-80 again and turns into N. Texas Street.
* The original route is preserved as Texas Street in Fairfield. 
* The original alignment between Fairfield and Vacaville can be found on Cherry Glen Road.
* In Vacaville the highway is preserved as Monte Vista Avenue. 
* An older alignment goes north from Vacaville to Midway Road on Browns Valley Rd, then east before turning northeast into Dixon on Porter Road, then along an old bypass of downtown Dixon north, N. Adams Street, then north along 1st Street, across I-80 onto Currey Road, then east on Sievers Road to Pedrick Road, then north on Pedrick Road to Russell Boulevard.
* In Davis, the highway is now Russell Boulevard, then B Street to 1st Street, then Richards Blvd. to Olive Drive. A segment of the eastbound lanes of the old US 40 expressway are accessible east of Davis on County Road 32A.
* In Sacramento the highway entered the city via the Tower Bridge and followed the routes of modern Capitol Avenue, SR 160 and Auburn Boulevard. 
* Between Roseville and Auburn, the highway is known Pacific Street through Rocklin, then Taylor Road to northeast of Newcastle, and then Ophir Road to its junction with I-80 just south of Auburn.

Through the Sierra Nevada many portions are still drivable, crossing I-80. Portions still drivable include 
* Applegate Road in Applegate
* Hampshire Rocks Road in a rural area near Cisco
* Donner Pass Road over Donner Pass and into Truckee

Between Truckee and the Nevada state line, the former route of US 40 is mostly visible from the freeway, but not drivable as a contiguous route. Portions accessible include Glenshire Drive, Hirshdale Road, and Floriston Way.

From 1954 to 1964, an alternate route US 40 was available, especially during winter, to avoid Donner Pass. Donner Pass, elevation , might be closed in winter. This alternate route used Beckwourth Pass, elevation of . Since Beckwourth Pass is nearly lower than Donner Pass, it could be kept open longer.

Alt. US 40 departed from the main track of US 40 near Davis and ran north along what was then signed as US 99W into Woodland.
* From Woodland, Alt. US 40 ran north along SR 24 through Knights Landing and Robbins into Yuba City. Most of the section from Woodland to Yuba City is now signed as SR 113.
* From Yuba City, Alt. US 40 ran east through Marysville, then north through Oroville.
* Continuing north and northeast, Alt. US 40 reached Paxton, then turned south and southeast to Quincy and Beckwourth.
* East of Beckwourth Pass, Alt. US 40 descended to meet US 395 at what is now Hallelujah Junction, and followed US 395 into Reno to meet mainline US 40.

The section from Marysville to US 395 was then still an extension of SR 24, but is now signed as SR 70, although much of the old highway was moved further west before Lake Oroville was dammed and flooded in 1968.

====Nevada====

In Nevada, US 40 was also directly replaced by I-80. All of the I-80 business loops use the historical route of US 40. In the Truckee Meadows the route is still drivable as 3rd street in Verdi and 4th street in Reno and Victorian Ave in Sparks. In rural Nevada the highway forms the business loops for Wadsworth, Fernley, Lovelock, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain, Carlin, Elko, and West Wendover. The route and its former alignments can be seen (and some still driven) all along the routing of I-80. Much of the old right-of-way of old US 40 has been either demolished or left to natural degradation.

====Utah====
In Wendover the former route of US 40 is signed as SR-58 and runs along the Wendover Cut-off, south of (and in view of) I-80, across the Bonneville Salt Flats. The route re-emerges from the shadow of I-80 as SR-138 through Grantsville and Tooele. Interstate 80 was directly paved over the former route of US 40 through Parley&#x27;s Canyon and over Parley&#x27;s Summit, with very little of the original pavement remaining through the mountains. East of the Wasatch Mountains is the modern terminus of US 40.

Two routes existed through Salt Lake City. West of Temple Square US 40 was consistently routed on North Temple Street. East of Temple Square US 40 had two alignments, originally departing Temple Square south along State Street concurrent with US 91 and US 89 to 2100 south. The road then used 2100 South and Parley&#x27;s Way, towards Parley&#x27;s Canyon. Later US 40 was moved to Foothill Drive, along modern SR-186, with the 2100 south routing becoming US 40ALT. The two routes converged at the mouth of Parley&#x27;s Canyon.

<doc id="436901" wikidata="Q316190" url="?curid=436901" title="Joe Sakic">
<text>Joseph Steven Sakic (; () born July 7, 1969) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player. He played his entire 21-year National Hockey League (NHL) career, which lasted from 1988 to 2009, with the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche franchise. Named captain of the team in 1992 (after serving as a co-captain in 1990–91), Sakic is regarded as one of the greatest team leaders in league history and was able to consistently motivate his team to play at a winning level. Nicknamed &quot;Burnaby Joe&quot;, Sakic was named to play in 13 NHL All-Star Games and selected to the NHL First All-Star Team at centre three times. Sakic led the Avalanche to Stanley Cup titles in 1996 and 2001, earning the most valuable player (MVP) in the 1996 playoffs. In 2001, Sakic earned both the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award as MVP of the NHL. He is one of six players to participate in the first two of the team&#x27;s Stanley Cup victories and won the Stanley Cup a third time with the Avalanche in 2022 while serving as the team&#x27;s general manager. Sakic became the third person, after Milt Schmidt and Serge Savard, to win the Stanley Cup with the same franchise as a player and general manager.

Over his career, Sakic was one of the most productive forwards in the game, scoring 50 goals twice and earning at least 100 points in six different seasons. Sakic&#x27;s wrist shot, considered one of the best in the NHL, was the source of much of his production as goalies around the league feared his rapid snap-shot release. At the conclusion of the 2008–09 NHL season, Sakic was the eighth all-time points leader in the NHL, as well as 14th in all-time goals and 11th in all-time assists. During the 2002 Winter Olympics, Sakic helped lead Team Canada to its first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years and was voted as the tournament&#x27;s MVP. Sakic represented Team Canada in six other international competitions, including the 1998 and 2006 Winter Olympics.

Sakic retired from the NHL in 2009 and had his jersey number 19 retired prior to the Avalanche&#x27;s 2009–10 season opener. In 2012, Sakic was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2013, Sakic was inducted into the Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. In 2017, Sakic was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. He was also inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2017.

Following the end of his playing career, Sakic continued with the Avalanche organization in a management capacity, first serving as executive advisor and alternate governor from 2011 to 2013. Sakic was promoted to executive vice president of hockey operations on May 10, 2013 and named general manager the following year. After overseeing a team rebuild, culminating in the franchise&#x27;s third Stanley Cup victory in 2022, Sakic won the Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year Award. The team announced shortly thereafter that Sakic was being promoted to president of hockey operations.

==Early life==
Sakic was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, to Marijan and Slavica Šakić (), immigrants from Croatia. Growing up in Burnaby, Sakic did not learn to speak English until kindergarten, having been raised with Croatian as his mother tongue. At the age of four, Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the Vancouver Canucks and Atlanta Flames. After watching the game, Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, Sakic was forced to use skill rather than size to excel and modelled himself after his idol, Wayne Gretzky. After showing exceptional promise as a young hockey player, Sakic was referred to as a new Wayne Gretzky in the making. Sakic scored 83 goals and 156 points in 80 games for Burnaby BC Selects while attending school at Burnaby North Secondary. Soon after, he was added to the Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL) for the last part of the 1985–86 season.

During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos relocated to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, playing in his first full season, scored 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. These totals saw him named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, he and his team faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka, and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.

==NHL career==

===Quebec Nordiques===
Sakic was drafted 15th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, a pick the Nordiques received when they traded away Dale Hunter and Clint Malarchuk to the Washington Capitals. Rather than make the immediate jump into the NHL, Sakic told Nordiques management he would prefer to spend the 1987–88 season in Swift Current to prepare for the NHL. Sakic made his professional debut on October 6, 1988, against the Hartford Whalers and registered an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender Sean Burke of the New Jersey Devils. During the season, Sakic wore number 88, because his preferred number 19 was already taken by a teammate, Alain Côté. While considered a front-runner for rookie of the year due to his rapid scoring pace, an ankle injury forced Sakic to miss 10 games in December. The resulting scoring slump helped quash any hopes of winning the award. Sakic would finish his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games, finishing eighth in voting for the Calder. Defenceman Brian Leetch won the rookie scoring race with 28 goals and 48 assists, receiving forty-two first-place votes, while Sakic only received two third-place votes.

In 1989–90, his second NHL season, Sakic was able to switch back to his familiar number 19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer) and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league, becoming the first player in NHL history to score 100 points on a last place team. At the start of the next season, 1990–91, Sakic was named co-captain of the Nordiques along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games). Sakic again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league but would slip during the 1991–92 season to 94 points after missing 11 games. In 1991–92, Mike Hough became captain of the Nordiques, while Sakic and Finn became alternate captains. Sakic began to display the leadership for which he would become known, standing firm during the tumultuous Eric Lindros holdout. With Lindros refusing to play for the Nordiques, one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, &quot;We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I&#x27;m tired of hearing that name. He&#x27;s not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game.&quot; Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players who vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.

Starting with the 1992–93 season, Sakic became the sole captain of the franchise. Under his leadership, the Nordiques made the playoffs for the first time in six years and set a franchise record for wins and points in the process (since broken by the 2021–22 Colorado Avalanche team). Sakic reached the 100-point plateau, the third time in five years, scoring 48 goals and 105 points in the regular season while adding another six points in the playoffs. After the shortened 1994–95 following the 1994–95 NHL lock-out, Sakic finished eight points behind Jaromír Jágr for the scoring title, finishing fourth place overall, and helped the Nordiques win the division title, their first since the 1985–86 season.

===Colorado Avalanche===
In May 1995, the Nordiques announced that the team had been sold and were relocating from Quebec. The franchise then moved to Denver, Colorado, and were renamed the Colorado Avalanche. Sakic led the team to a Stanley Cup championship in its first year, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. Sakic was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the Cup, Sakic again proved himself to be an effective team leader. Although his Nordiques had missed the playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. Sakic was one goal away from the record for goals in a playoff year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.
In the 1996–97 season, Sakic played in only 65 games due to a lacerated calf yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy and third straight division title. Sakic had another great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists and took the Avalanche all the way to the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers as a restricted free agent. Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers&#x27; offer or let go of Sakic in exchange for five first-round draft picks as compensation. While it seemed as if the Avalanche could not afford to keep Sakic, as they had already committed large amounts of salary to Peter Forsberg and Patrick Roy, an unlikely lifeline would appear in the form of the summer blockbuster movie &quot;Air Force One&quot;, produced by Avalanche owners COMSAT. Its profits enabled the Avalanche to match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.

Injuries would again limit Sakic&#x27;s playing time during the 1997–98 season. While playing in his first Olympics with Team Canada, Sakic hurt his knee and was forced to miss 18 games with the Avalanche. In the 64 games in which he did play, Sakic still scored 63 points, enough to earn him his seventh all-star appearance. Sakic finally rebounded from his injuries in the 1998–99 season, finishing fifth in the league in scoring with 41 goals and 96 points in only 73 games. Sakic led the Avalanche to within one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Dallas Stars. After the season ended, Sakic ranked number 94 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 greatest hockey players.

During the 1999–2000 season, Sakic reached several career milestones. Injuries limited him to only 60 games, but he still managed to lead the team in scoring with 81 points. On December 27, 1999, against the St. Louis Blues, Sakic earned an assist to become the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points. Later in the season, on March 23, 2000, he scored a hat-trick against the Phoenix Coyotes and became the 59th player to score 400 career goals. It also gave Sakic 1,049 points with the franchise, passing Peter Šťastný as the all-time leader on the team.

Sakic eclipsed the 100 point mark again in 2000–01, finishing with 118 points along with a career-best 54 goals, both second-best in the league. Sakic won the Hart Memorial Trophy, the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy and the Lester B. Pearson Award (the latter presented to him by former Nordiques mentor Peter Šťastný) while also being a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy. Sakic led the Avalanche to their second Stanley Cup championship, defeating the defending title holding New Jersey Devils in seven games. Memorably, after receiving the Stanley Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, Sakic broke with tradition. Instead of hoisting it first as most captains do, Sakic passed the cup straight to Ray Bourque, a player who had waited a record-breaking 22 seasons to win the Stanley Cup.

Sakic led the Avalanche in scoring again in the 2001–02 season, finishing sixth in the league with 79 points. On March 9, 2002, Sakic played in his 1,000th career game. The Avalanche once again reached the Western Conference Finals but lost to the eventual cup-winning Detroit Red Wings. The following year, Sakic appeared in only 58 games and finished with just 58 points. Sakic rebounded the following year, finishing third in the league with 87 points. It also marked the first time since the 1993–94 season that the franchise did not win the division title, which was won by the Vancouver Canucks.

Following the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, the Avalanche were forced to lose many of their key players in order to stay below the salary cap. Even with the loss of teammates Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, Sakic still helped the Avalanche get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the Avalanche for the 2006–07 season. Upon the retirement of Steve Yzerman a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the league leader for most career points among active players.

Sakic had another strong season in the 2006–07. He scored his 600th career goal on February 15, 2007, against the Calgary Flames, becoming the 17th player in history to reach the milestone and third that year. On the final day of the regular season, Sakic scored his 100th point, reaching the milestone for the sixth time in his career. At the same time, Sakic became the second-oldest NHL player to score 100 points in a season at age 37, alongside hockey legend Gordie Howe. Despite his efforts, as well as a late-season charge, Sakic and the Avalanche missed the playoffs for the first time in 11 years, finishing one point behind the eighth placed Calgary Flames. On May 1, the NHL announced that Sakic was named as one of the three finalists for the Lady Byng Trophy, but it was eventually awarded to Pavel Datsyuk of the Detroit Red Wings.

In April 2007, Sakic signed to a 19th NHL season with the Avalanche on a one-year deal for the 2007–08 season. Sakic commented on the deal, saying, &quot;at this stage in my career, I prefer to do one-year deals as I evaluate my play year-to-year.&quot; Upon signing Sakic to the deal, Avalanche General Manager François Giguère said, &quot;Joe is the heart of this organization and his leadership and value to this team and especially our young players is unquestioned.&quot; On October 7, 2007, he scored a goal and had an assist against the San Jose Sharks, moving past Phil Esposito into eighth place on the NHL career points list with 1,591 points. Nineteen days later, Sakic scored a goal and assisted Ryan Smyth for an overtime game-winning goal against the Calgary Flames, reaching his 1,600th point in the NHL. On December 27, 2007, it was announced that Sakic underwent hernia surgery to accelerate the recovery of an injury that had forced him to miss the previous 12 games after a 232 consecutive games-played streak. The operation caused him to miss a career-high 38 games. He was activated off injured reserve on February 24 and played that night, recording an assist. On March 22, 2008, Sakic recorded his 1,000th career assist against the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the 11th player in NHL history to reach the milestone.

In June 2008, Sakic spoke with Colorado General Manager François Giguère and said he was uncertain with his future with the Avalanche. However, it was announced on August 27, 2008, that Sakic would sign a one-year contract with the team. Injuries limited Sakic&#x27;s playing time in 2008–09. After 15 games, in which he scored 12 points, a herniated disk forced Sakic to stop playing in early November. While at home letting his back heal, Sakic broke three fingers in a snow-blower accident.

Sakic announced his retirement on July 9, 2009 The Avalanche retired his jersey number 19 prior to their 2009–10 season opener on October 1, 2009, with a &quot;C&quot; on the banner to represent his lengthy service as team captain (having been the only captain of the Avalanche until he retired). The Avalanche also named Sakic the inaugural member of the Avalanche Alumni Association.

===All-Star Games===
Sakic was voted into the NHL All-Star Game 13 times and played in 12 of them, serving as a captain for two, the last in 2007. He had at least one point in 11 of them. The only one Sakic missed was the 1997 All-Star Game due to injury. Sakic won the MVP award in the 2004 All-Star Game after scoring a hat trick, despite the Western Conference losing the game. He is the all-time assist leader in All-Star Games with 16 assists and is third place in all-time all-star scoring with 22 points, behind Mario Lemieux (23 points) and Wayne Gretzky (25 points). His best record in an All-Star Game was in 2007, when he scored four assists for the winning team; however, the MVP award was given to Daniel Brière, who had a goal and four assists.

==International play==





Sakic had an extensive international hockey career, representing Canada in seven international competitions. After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, Sakic went on to help the Canadian junior team win the 1988 World Junior Championship. Sakic&#x27;s next tournament was the 1991 World Championships, in which Team Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games. Sakic tried out for the 1991 Canada Cup Canadian team but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength. Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he was not given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience &quot;a complete waste of time.&quot;

Sakic&#x27;s first successful professional tournament was the 1994 World Championships, in whiche Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic&#x27;s seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team&#x27;s success. During the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, Sakic played only a minor role in Canada&#x27;s second-place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games. However, the tournament allowed Sakic to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.

Sakic&#x27;s first Olympic appearance came in 1998 at Nagano, Japan, the first tournament in which NHL players participated. Bothered by a knee injury, Sakic scored only three points in four games as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished fourth. Sakic&#x27;s second Olympic appearance came in 2002 in Salt Lake City; led by his strong play, the Canadian team reached the gold medal match against Team USA, in which Sakic scored four points and helped Canada to its first gold medal in 50 years. Sakic was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists and became one of the first Canadian members of the Triple Gold Club. Sakic also played a part in Canada&#x27;s triumph in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, where he scored six points in six games.

On December 21, 2005, Sakic was named captain of Canada for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Once again, Canada was heavily favoured to win and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall. Sakic finished the tournament with three points.

==Executive career==
After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family. In 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic returned to the Avalanche to work in their front office. Sakic was named an executive advisor and alternate governor of the team, effective at the end of the 2010–11 season. In his role as an advisor, Sakic advised the team in hockey-related matters. As an alternate governor, Sakic represented the team at Board of Governors meetings.

On June 26, 2012, Sakic was selected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 12, 2012, along with Mats Sundin, Pavel Bure and Adam Oates. Sakic was the only member of his class who won the Stanley Cup during his career.

On May 10, 2013, the Avalanche promoted Sakic to executive vice president of hockey operations. In this expanded role, Sakic had the final say on all matters regarding hockey personnel. During Patrick Roy&#x27;s tenure as head coach, they shared most of the duties normally held by a general manager. General Manager Greg Sherman remained in his post but served mainly in an advisory role to Roy and Sakic. This de facto arrangement was formalized the following season, when Sakic was formally named general manager and Sherman was demoted to assistant general manager.

Sakic&#x27;s tenure as general manager faced early adversity, notably in the 2016–17 season, in which the team finished in last place and managed only 48 points in the standings. Sakic later admitted that at points he was to be relieved by team ownership in midst of the poor results. Despite finishing last, the team did not win any of the top three lottery picks in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, dropping to fourth. This seeming misfortune would later prove beneficial, as it led to the Avalanche selecting future Norris Trophy-winning defenceman Cale Makar at fourth overall. The poor season also perpetuated a trade request from star player Matt Duchene, which Sakic would ultimately translate into several assets, including defencemen Sam Girard and Bowen Byram. In later years, Sakic would make additional trades for Nazem Kadri, Devon Toews, and Artturi Lehkonen, and sign Valeri Nichushkin as a free agent. The Avalanche won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy for the 2020–21 season but faltered in the second round of the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The Avalanche finished second in the regular season the following year but won the Stanley Cup. Sakic became only the third person, after Milt Schmidt and Serge Savard, to win a Stanley Cup with the same franchise as a player and general manager. In recognition of his work for the 2021–22 season, Sakic received the Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year Award.

On July 11, 2022, the Avalanche announced that Sakic would be ceding the general manager title to longtime assistant Chris MacFarland and assuming a new role as President of Hockey Operations.

==Personal life==
Sakic and his wife Debbie have three children: son Mitchell, born 1996, and fraternal twins, son Chase and daughter Kamryn, born October 2000. Sakic and his wife met at a local high school while he was playing in Swift Current, and they frequently return to the town during the off-season. Sakic is an avid golfer and competed in the celebrity pro am golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in the summer of 2006. Each summer during his playing career, Sakic also hosted his own charity golf tournament, which benefited the Food Bank of the Rockies. Sakic&#x27;s charity work is estimated to have provided more than seven million meals to poor children and families and earned him an NHL Foundation Player Award in 2007.

Sakic is a fan favourite in his hometown of Burnaby, where a street has been named Joe Sakic Way in his honour. Throughout British Columbia, Sakic is known as &quot;Burnaby Joe&quot;. In Colorado, Sakic is known as &quot;Super Joe.&quot; His younger brother Brian joined the Swift Current Broncos during Joe&#x27;s final season with the team and later played for the Flint Generals of the United Hockey League. Sakic also has an uncredited role in the movie Happy Gilmore as a &quot;player at hockey tryouts&quot;.

===Milestones===
Sakic recorded his 1,000th career point on December 27, 1999, against the St. Louis Blues. Sakic became the 11th player to reach 1,500 points, doing so on October 25, 2006, with an assist against the Washington Capitals, and the sixth to do so with one franchise. Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Ray Bourque, and Steve Yzerman are the others who achieved this feat.

Sakic played his 1,000th career game on March 9, 2002, against the Los Angeles Kings. Sakic&#x27;s 500th career goal came against the Vancouver Canucks on December 11, 2002. In a February 15, 2007, game against the Calgary Flames, Sakic scored his 600th career goal. He also earned his 900th assist, the 16th player to do so, against the Flames in a game on March 12, 2006.

During the final game of the 2006–07 season, Sakic scored his 100th point of the year. This made him, at age 37, the second oldest player in NHL history, after Gordie Howe, to record 100 points in a regular season. Sakic became the longest active tenured captain in the league, with fifteen seasons leading the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise, after the retirement of Steve Yzerman at the conclusion of the 2005–06 regular season. On March 22, 2008, against the Edmonton Oilers, Sakic recorded the 1,000th assist of his career, the 11th player to do so. The gloves he wore in the game were later sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Alongside Bobby Clarke, Wayne Gretzky, and Mark Messier, Sakic is one of four players to captain his team to a Stanley Cup championship and win the Hart Memorial Trophy in the same year. Sakic is also a member of the Triple Gold Club, a term used in hockey to describe players who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal and the Stanley Cup.

===Records===
In his 20-year career with the Nordiques and Avalanche, Sakic obtained nearly all of the franchise scoring records, including most all-time goals (625), assists (1,016) and points (1,641). He also holds the franchise record for most games played (1,363), and also holds several notable NHL records, including most All-Star game assists (16) and most playoff overtime goals (8).

===Leadership===
Throughout his career, Sakic was one of the top scorers in the league; but in his early years, he was criticized for not leading his team to playoff success. While in Quebec, the Nordiques were one of the worst teams in the league, finishing last in their division five out of the seven years Sakic was with the team, including three straight years of being last overall in the league. After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen as capable of leading a team to success, and he was seen as one of the league&#x27;s premier players.

Though Sakic was a quiet individual, he was able to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic&#x27;s leadership began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen as the leader of the team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick Eric Lindros and holding onto Lindros&#x27; rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros. Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic&#x27;s leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain Mark Messier, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.

One of the most defining actions of Sakic&#x27;s career was at the conclusion of the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate around with the Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate Ray Bourque. Bourque, one of the best defensemen to ever play, had been traded to the Avalanche the year before after spending 21 years with the Boston Bruins and setting the record for most games played without winning the Cup.

When an eye injury forced Steve Yzerman (who normally wore number 19 for Canada) to miss the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, Sakic and Joe Thornton both refused the number out of respect for their injured countryman, even though both players each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and were now eligible to wear it for Team Canada in Yzerman&#x27;s absence.

Sakic&#x27;s leadership qualities and abilities helped carry the Avalanche in the years after their 2001 Stanley Cup, which saw the team lose key players to retirement and free agency, especially after the 2004–05 lock-out.

<doc id="436906" wikidata="Q1363891" url="?curid=436906" title="Lopburi">
<text>Lopburi (, , ) is the capital city of Lopburi Province in Thailand. It is about northeast of Bangkok. It has a population of 58,000. The town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) covers the whole &quot;tambon&quot; Tha Hin and parts of Thale Chup Son of Mueang Lopburi District, a total area of 6.85 km2.

==History==
The city has a history dating back to the Dvaravati period more than 1,000 years ago. According to the &quot;Northern Chronicles,&quot; Lavo was founded by Phraya Kalavarnadishraj, who came from Takkasila in 648 CE. According to Thai records, Phraya Kakabatr from Takkasila (it is assumed that the city was Tak or Nakhon Chai Si) set the new era, Chula Sakarat in 638 CE, which was the era used by the Siamese and the Burmese until the 19th century. His son, Phraya Kalavarnadishraj founded the city a decade later. Lopburi, or Lavapura as it then was, was under the rule of the rising Angkor regime and became one of the most important centers in the Chao Phraya Basin from then on. Epigraphic evidence indicates that the dominant population of the city was Mon.

The earliest confirmed occurrence of the name Lavapura is on silver coins inscribed &quot;lava&quot; on the obverse and &quot;pura&quot; on the reverse in a Pallava-derived script of the seventh or eighth century; several such coins were recovered in 1966 from a hoard found in an ancient jar in U Thong.

Inscriptions say that Lopburi was incorporated into the administration structure of the Khmer Empire during the reign of Suryavarman I. Control of Lopburi gave the Khmer Empire access to trade going through the Kra Isthmus.
There is some evidence the Khmer Empire, under Suryavarman II, fought against the Mons in the 12th century over suzerainty. Lopburi sent embassies to China in 1115 and 1155.

Lopburi (Lavo) is described in Book III of Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;, where it is called &quot;Locach&quot;. This came from the Chinese (Cantonese) pronunciation of Lavo, &quot;Lo-huk&quot;. The city is referred to as &quot;Lo-ho&quot; in chapter 20 of the History of Yuan (元史 : &quot;Yuán Shǐ&quot;), the official history of the Mongol, or Yuan Dynasty of China. Due to a scribal error in Book III of Marco Polo&#x27;s travels treating of the route southward from Champa, where the name Java was substituted for Champa as the point of departure, Java Minor was 1,300 miles to the south of Java Major, instead of from Champa, on or near an extension of the Terra Australis. As explained by Sir Henry Yule, the editor of an English edition of Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;: &quot;Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of &quot;Boeach&quot; (or Locac), introduced in their maps a continent in that situation&quot;.

After the foundation of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 14th century, Lopburi was a stronghold of Ayutthaya&#x27;s rulers. It became the capital of the kingdom during the reign of King Narai the Great in the mid-17th century and the king resided there about eight months a year.

==Archeological finds==
* several flaked stone tools were discovered in Ban Mi district  dated back to the Paleolithic Age in 1931.
* a number of tools, human burial sites and bronze accessories belong to Iron Age were found in Lop Buri river Basin in 1964.
* Bracelets and beads dated back 2700–3500 years were revealed at Ban Khok Charoen in 1966–1970.
* Prehistoric human skeletons and clay jugs were found in Ban Tha Kae in 1979.
* A Copper source was discovered in Khao Wong Phrachan in 1986–1994.

==Geography==
Lopburi lies on the Lopburi River at an elevation of mostly surrounded by alluvial plains, although some hills rise to between and to the north-east.

==Climate==
Lopburi has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from late April through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

==Transportation==
The main road through Lobpuri is Route 1 (Phahonyothin Road), which starts in Bangkok, and continues through Lopburi, Chai Nat, Nakhon Sawan, Kamphaeng Phet, Tak, Lampang, Chiang Rai, and the border with Burma at Mae Sai. Route 311 leads west to Sing Buri, and Route 3196 leads south-west to Ang Thong.

Lopburi is a station of the State Railway of Thailand&#x27;s Northern Line, forming the end of Bangkok&#x27;s suburban service. Train service from Bangkok railway station (Hua Lamphong) in Bangkok usually takes about 2 hours. The third class train costs less than $1 and is a great way to experience the local culture and the &quot;Real Thailand&quot;.

Lopburi had a short-lived tramway system, operating between 1955-1962. It was the only provincial tramway system outside Bangkok.

The Khok Kathiam Air Force Base is northeast of the town.

==Monkey population==
Today, the city is best known for the thousands of long-tailed macaques (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;) that live there, especially around the Khmer temple Prang Sam Yot and the Khmer shrine Sarn Phra Karn. It is suspected that urban expansion caused the monkeys to adapt to city life. They are fed by the local people, especially during the annual Monkey Festival, which usually occurs on the last Sunday of November. The monkeys can be aggressive, are not afraid of humans, and often steal whatever items or food they can find from unwary visitors. Most of the hotels and guesthouses in Lopburi are &quot;monkey-proofed&quot; using screen wire or sealed windows.

In the city, signs are posted, reading: 

During the 2020–21 COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of tourists prompted hungry monkeys to harass local residents. To address the problem, the government implemented a mass roundup and sterilization program in 2024. Within five months, 1,600 of the estimated 3,000 monkeys had been captured for neutering.

<text>The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is a Fourier-related transform used to determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time. In practice, the procedure for computing STFTs is to divide a longer time signal into shorter segments of equal length and then compute the Fourier transform separately on each shorter segment. This reveals the Fourier spectrum on each shorter segment. One then usually plots the changing spectra as a function of time, known as a spectrogram or waterfall plot, such as commonly used in software defined radio (SDR) based spectrum displays. Full bandwidth displays covering the whole range of an SDR commonly use fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) with 2^24 points on desktop computers.

== Forward STFT ==

=== Continuous-time STFT ===
Simply, in the continuous-time case, the function to be transformed is multiplied by a window function which is nonzero for only a short period of time. The Fourier transform (a one-dimensional function) of the resulting signal is taken, then the window is slid along the time axis until the end resulting in a two-dimensional representation of the signal. Mathematically, this is written as:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the window function, commonly a Hann window or Gaussian window centered around zero, and formula_3 is the signal to be transformed (note the difference between the window function formula_4 and the frequency formula_5). formula_6 is essentially the Fourier transform of formula_7, a complex function representing the phase and magnitude of the signal over time and frequency. Often phase unwrapping is employed along either or both the time axis, formula_8, and frequency axis, formula_5, to suppress any jump discontinuity of the phase result of the STFT. The time index formula_8 is normally considered to be &quot;slow&quot; time and usually not expressed in as high resolution as time formula_11. Given that the STFT is essentially a Fourier transform times a window function, the STFT is also called windowed Fourier transform or time-dependent Fourier transform.

=== Discrete-time STFT ===

In the discrete time case, the data to be transformed could be broken up into chunks or frames (which usually overlap each other, to reduce artifacts at the boundary). Each chunk is Fourier transformed, and the complex result is added to a matrix, which records magnitude and phase for each point in time and frequency. This can be expressed as:

:formula_12

likewise, with signal formula_13 and window formula_14. In this case, &quot;m&quot; is discrete and ω is continuous, but in most typical applications the STFT is performed on a computer using the fast Fourier transform, so both variables are discrete and quantized.

The magnitude squared of the STFT yields the spectrogram representation of the power spectral density of the function:

:formula_15

See also the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), which is also a Fourier-related transform that uses overlapping windows.

==== Sliding DFT ====
If only a small number of ω are desired, or if the STFT is desired to be evaluated for every shift &quot;m&quot; of the window, then the STFT may be more efficiently evaluated using a sliding DFT algorithm.

== Inverse STFT ==
The STFT is invertible, that is, the original signal can be recovered from the transform by the inverse STFT. The most widely accepted way of inverting the STFT is by using the overlap-add (OLA) method, which also allows for modifications to the STFT complex spectrum. This makes for a versatile signal processing method, referred to as the &quot;overlap and add with modifications&quot; method.

=== Continuous-time STFT ===
Given the width and definition of the window function &quot;w&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), we initially require the area of the window function to be scaled so that

:formula_16

It easily follows that

:formula_17

and

:formula_18

The continuous Fourier transform is

:formula_19

Substituting &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) from above:

:formula_20

:::formula_21

Swapping order of integration:

:formula_22

:::formula_23

:::formula_24

So the Fourier transform can be seen as a sort of phase coherent sum of all of the STFTs of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). Since the inverse Fourier transform is

:formula_25

then &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) can be recovered from &quot;X&quot;(τ,ω) as

:formula_26

or

:formula_27

It can be seen, comparing to above that windowed &quot;grain&quot; or &quot;wavelet&quot; of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is

:formula_28

the inverse Fourier transform of &quot;X&quot;(τ,ω) for τ fixed.

An alternative definition that is valid only in the vicinity of τ, the inverse transform is:
:formula_29

In general, the window function formula_30 has the following properties:

:(a) even symmetry: formula_31;
:(b) non-increasing (for positive time): formula_32 if formula_33;
:(c) compact support: formula_30 is equal to zero when |t| is large.

== Resolution issues ==
One of the pitfalls of the STFT is that it has a fixed resolution. The width of the windowing function relates to how the signal is represented—it determines whether there is good frequency resolution (frequency components close together can be separated) or good time resolution (the time at which frequencies change). A wide window gives better frequency resolution but poor time resolution. A narrower window gives good time resolution but poor frequency resolution. These are called narrowband and wideband transforms, respectively.

This is one of the reasons for the creation of the wavelet transform and multiresolution analysis, which can give good time resolution for high-frequency events and good frequency resolution for low-frequency events, the combination best suited for many real signals.

This property is related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but not directly – see Gabor limit for discussion. The product of the standard deviation in time and frequency is limited. The boundary of the uncertainty principle (best simultaneous resolution of both) is reached with a Gaussian window function (or mask function), as the Gaussian minimizes the Fourier uncertainty principle. This is called the Gabor transform (and with modifications for multiresolution becomes the Morlet wavelet transform).

One can consider the STFT for varying window size as a two-dimensional domain (time and frequency), as illustrated in the example below, which can be calculated by varying the window size. However, this is no longer a strictly time-frequency representation – the kernel is not constant over the entire signal.

=== Examples ===
When the original function is:

:formula_35

We can have a simple example:

w(t) = 1 for |t| smaller than or equal B

w(t) = 0 otherwise

B = window

Now the original function of the Short-time Fourier transform can be changed as

:formula_36

Another example:

Using the following sample signal formula_3 that is composed of a set of four sinusoidal waveforms joined together in sequence. Each waveform is only composed of one of four frequencies (10, 25, 50, 100 Hz). The definition of formula_3 is:

:formula_39

Then it is sampled at 400 Hz. The following spectrograms were produced:

The 25 ms window allows us to identify a precise time at which the signals change but the precise frequencies are difficult to identify. At the other end of the scale, the 1000 ms window allows the frequencies to be precisely seen but the time between frequency changes is blurred.

Other examples:

:formula_40

Normally we call formula_41 a Gaussian function or Gabor function. When we use it, the short-time Fourier transform is called the &quot;Gabor transform&quot;.

=== Explanation ===
It can also be explained with reference to the sampling and Nyquist frequency.

Take a window of &quot;N&quot; samples from an arbitrary real-valued signal at sampling rate &quot;f&quot;s . Taking the Fourier transform produces &quot;N&quot; complex coefficients. Of these coefficients only half are useful (the last &quot;N/2&quot; being the complex conjugate of the first &quot;N/2&quot; in reverse order, as this is a real valued signal).

These &quot;N/2&quot; coefficients represent the frequencies 0 to &quot;f&quot;s/2 (Nyquist) and two consecutive coefficients are spaced apart by
&quot;f&quot;s/&quot;N&quot; Hz.

To increase the frequency resolution of the window the frequency spacing of the coefficients needs to be reduced. There are only two variables, but decreasing &quot;f&quot;s (and keeping &quot;N&quot; constant) will cause the window size to increase — since there are now fewer samples per unit time. The other alternative is to increase &quot;N&quot;, but this again causes the window size to increase. So any attempt to increase the frequency resolution causes a larger window size and therefore a reduction in time resolution—and vice versa.

== Rayleigh frequency ==
As the Nyquist frequency is a limitation in the maximum frequency that can be meaningfully analysed, so is the Rayleigh frequency a limitation on the minimum frequency.

The Rayleigh frequency is the minimum frequency that can be resolved by a finite duration time window.

Given a time window that is Τ seconds long, the minimum frequency that can be resolved is 1/Τ Hz.

The Rayleigh frequency is an important consideration in applications of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), as well as any other method of harmonic analysis on a signal of finite record-length.

== Application ==

STFTs as well as standard Fourier transforms and other tools are frequently used to analyze music. The spectrogram can, for example, show frequency on the horizontal axis, with the lowest frequencies at left, and the highest at the right. The height of each bar (augmented by color) represents the amplitude of the frequencies within that band. The depth dimension represents time, where each new bar was a separate distinct transform. Audio engineers use this kind of visual to gain information about an audio sample, for example, to locate the frequencies of specific noises (especially when used with greater frequency resolution) or to find frequencies which may be more or less resonant in the space where the signal was recorded. This information can be used for equalization or tuning other audio effects.

<text>U.S. Route 45 (US 45) is a major north-south United States highway and a border-to-border route, from Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico. A sign at the highway&#x27;s northern terminus notes the total distance as .

US 45 is notable for incorporating, in its maiden alignment, the first paved road in the South, a 49-mile (79 km) segment in Lee County, Mississippi. Let to contract in July 1914, the concrete highway opened on November 15, 1915.

As of 2006, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Ontonagon, Michigan, at the corner of Ontonagon and River Streets, a few blocks from Lake Superior (M-64 formerly terminated there as well until its rerouting in October 2006 to use the newly built Ontonagon River Bridge). US 45&#x27;s southern terminus is in Mobile, Alabama, at an intersection with U.S. Route 98.

== Route description ==

=== Alabama ===

US 45 is concurrent with unsigned SR 17 between Mobile and Vinegar Bend, just north of Deer Park, in Washington County, Alabama. From Vinegar Bend to the Mississippi state line, US 45 is concurrent with unsigned SR 57.
=== Mississippi ===
U.S. Highway 45 is part of a designated hurricane evacuation route in Mississippi. It is entirely four-laned from its point of entry from Alabama, at the town of State Line, to the Tennessee line just north of Corinth, along the way serving the towns of (from south to north) Waynesboro, Meridian, Columbus and Tupelo. U.S. 45 is a freeway in the vicinity of Meridian, from Shannon to Saltillo, and from south of Corinth to the Tennessee state line.

At Brooksville, U.S. 45 splits away from U.S. 45 Alternate and serves the towns of Columbus and Aberdeen before rejoining U.S. 45 Alternate south of Tupelo. The alternate roadway provides a more direct and entirely four-laned route between Meridian and Tupelo, bypassing Columbus to the west and, more closely, Starkville to the east.

Major junctions of U.S. 45 in Mississippi include U.S. Route 84 at Waynesboro, Interstate 20/59 at Meridian, U.S. Route 82 at Columbus, Interstate 22/U.S. Route 78 at Tupelo and U.S. Route 72 at Corinth. Each of these junctions is an interchange and, with the exception of Columbus and Waynesboro, each is part of a freeway segment.

The Mississippi section of U.S. 45 is defined at Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3.

===Tennessee===

Southern section

From the Mississippi state line, US 45 extends north past the cities of Guys, Eastview, Selmer, Bethel Springs, Finger, Henderson, Pinson, and Jackson to Three Way, where the highway splits into US 45W and US 45E.

U.S. Route 45W

US 45W is a state highway in West Tennessee, connecting Jackson with South Fulton via Humboldt, Trenton, Dyer, Rutherford, Kenton, and Union City. For the majority of its length, it is concurrent with unsigned State Route 5 (SR 5).

U.S. Route 45E


US 45E is a state highway in West Tennessee, connecting Jackson with South Fulton via Medina, Milan, Bradford, Greenfield, Sharon, and Martin. For the majority of its length, it is concurrent with unsigned State Route 43 (SR 43) for most of the route&#x27;s length except for short segments at Martin and South Fulton, where it is cosigned with SR 216 and SR 215 respectively.

Northern section

Mainline US 45, concurrent with unsigned SR 3, goes northeast and passes through neighborhoods in South Fulton along Chickasaw Drive before turning north onto Highland Drive at an intersection with Kentucky Route 116 (KY 116/W State Line Street) at the western edge of downtown. US 45 then crosses into Kentucky and the city of Fulton.

=== Kentucky ===

U.S. 45 enters Kentucky at Fulton then northeast past Mayfield then heads directly north into Paducah as a four-lane highway. In Paducah, U.S. 45 serves as a major artery, intersecting with Interstate 24 at exit 7, and intersecting US 60 and 62. U.S. 45 leaves Kentucky from Paducah&#x27;s northern border across the two-lane, metal-grate Brookport Bridge to Brookport, Illinois across the Ohio River.

=== Illinois ===
In the state of Illinois, U.S. 45 runs from a bridge across the Ohio River from Paducah, Kentucky, through Shawnee National Forest and north to the Wisconsin border east of Antioch, Illinois. With a length of in Illinois, U.S. 45 is the longest numbered route in Illinois.

In its progress north from the Ohio River U.S. 45 first joins Interstate 24 as far as Vienna then heads northeast through Harrisburg and Eldorado in Saline County and north through Fairfield, Flora, Effingham, Mattoon, Champaign, Urbana, Gilman and Kankakee, then straight north through the western suburbs of Chicago in Will County, Cook County and Lake County to the Wisconsin border.

=== Wisconsin ===

U.S. 45 enters the state in southeast Wisconsin. It runs concurrent with Interstate 894 and U.S. Route 41 through the west side of metro Milwaukee to form a major artery through the metropolitan area. It runs north to Fond du Lac. The highway routes near the western shore of Lake Winnebago through Oshkosh, Wisconsin. U.S. 45 then travels north through Wittenberg, Antigo, and Eagle River, as well as the state and national forests, until it leaves the state at Land O&#x27; Lakes and enters Michigan.
=== Michigan ===
US 45 enters Michigan south of Watersmeet. From there, the highway crosses the Western Upper Peninsula through the Ottawa National Forest running north to Ontonagon. US 45 ends just south of Lake Superior in downtown Ontonagon. The terminus was not changed in 2006 despite realignment then of M-38 and M-64 from the terminus to a crossing south.

== History ==

Until March 1935, US 45&#x27;s northern terminus was at US 12 in Des Plaines, Illinois near Chicago.

Prior to the construction of the Interstate Highway system, US 45 was one of the main routes south out of Chicago toward New Orleans. Much of the traffic left US 45 at Effingham, Illinois, continuing on through Cairo, Illinois along Illinois Route 37.

==Future==
In 2023, an effort began to improve US 45 in Tupelo, Mississippi. A $112 million plan to straighten US 45 at McCullough Boulevard, Hilda Avenue and Front Street in a series of interchanges to solve congestion and safety issues in this area. In additions to these improvements, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker requested $5 million for the 2023 fiscal year to fund preconstruction activities that would upgrade US 45 to interstate standards between Tupelo and Shannon, Mississippi. The potential interstate spur, which would be an auxiliary route of I-22, is currently listed as High Priority Corridor 95.

<doc id="436925" wikidata="Q158154" url="?curid=436925" title="Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia">
<text>Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia (; – 24 October 1920) was the fifth child and only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse and by Rhine; she was Duchess of Edinburgh and later Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as the wife of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She was the younger sister of Alexander III of Russia and the paternal aunt of Russia&#x27;s last emperor, Nicholas II.

In 1874, Maria married Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; she was the only Romanov to marry into the British royal family. The couple had five children: Alfred, Marie, Victoria Melita, Alexandra, and Beatrice. For the first years of her marriage, Maria lived in England. She neither adapted to the British court nor overcame her dislike for her adopted country. She accompanied her husband on his postings as an admiral of the Royal Navy at Malta (1886–1889) and Devonport (1890–1893). The Duchess of Edinburgh travelled extensively through Europe. She visited her family in Russia frequently and stayed for long periods in England and Germany attending social and family events.

In August 1893, Maria became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha when her husband inherited the duchy on the death of his childless uncle, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She enjoyed life in Germany, where she became active in cultural endeavours and charitable work. To her daughters, she gave every support, but she was critical of her wayward son, Alfred, who died in 1899. Her husband died in 1900 and was succeeded as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha by his nephew Charles Edward.

In her widowhood, Maria continued to live in Coburg. The outbreak of World War I divided her sympathies. She sided with Germany against her native Russia. Many of her relatives, including her brother Paul and her nephew Nicholas II, were killed during the Russian Revolution, and Maria lost her considerable fortune. After World War I, the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ceased to exist in November 1918. Maria died in 1920 while living under reduced circumstances in exile in Switzerland.

==Grand Duchess of Russia==

===Early life===

Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna was born on at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo. She was the sixth child and only surviving daughter among the eight children of Emperor Alexander II and his first wife, Empress Maria Alexandrovna (née Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). At the time of her birth, her grandfather, Nicholas I, was on the Russian throne and her father was Tsesarevich. In 1855, when Maria was seventeen months old, Nicholas I died and her father became the new Russian emperor. The Grand Duchess grew up as the only girl with four older brothers and two younger ones. She did not know her only sister, Alexandra, who had died before she was born. Maria herself almost died from a throat disease at the age of seven.

Maria&#x27;s childhood was spent in luxury and splendor in the large palaces and country estates owned by the Romanovs. The family&#x27;s main residence was the sixteen-hundred-room Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, with another residence at Gatchina, forty miles south. In the summer, the family stayed in Peterhof, a large complex with farms, cottages, and various pavilions on the Gulf of Finland. From the end of the summer until winter, the imperial family moved to Tsarskoye Selo, the imperial town, where the Romanovs had the Catherine Palace and Alexander Palace. In the children&#x27;s island, located in a pond in the park of the Alexander Palace, Maria had her own private little house, off limit to adults, which she used with her brothers as a playhouse. Her father added a farm, built for her enjoyment when she was eight years old.

Maria was beloved by her parents. Her governess, Anna Tyutcheva (1829–1889), a daughter of the celebrated poet Fyodor Tyutchev, reflected that &quot;the whole family adores this child&quot; and that her parents &quot;shower her with kisses and affection.&quot; Empress Maria felt &quot;boundless adoration&quot; for her only surviving daughter. Alexander II enjoyed spending time with her, and he considered her his favorite child. He told Anna Tyutcheva that &quot;almost every evening I come to feed soup to this little cherub. This is the only enjoyable minute of my whole day, the only time when I forget the troubles that weigh upon me.&quot; When she was bored with her studies, she would burst into her father&#x27;s study and interrupt his meetings with his ministers.

Maria had a close relationship with her brothers. Her governess noted that she &quot;cannot stand when someone reprimands any of her brothers. This brings her to the state of real despair.&quot; Empress Maria had weak lungs and had to travel constantly to Germany and southern Europe to escape the harsh Russian winters. She often took her three younger children with her on these trips, so Maria became especially close to her two younger brothers, Sergei and Paul.

Surrounded only by brothers, Maria grew up as a tomboy, with an independent character and a strong will. &quot;She is absolutely genuine and never changes in front of strangers,&quot; observed Anna Tyutcheva, adding that: &quot;She is accustomed to be the center of the world and that everyone yields to her.&quot; Tyutcheva described her pupil as &quot;stubborn and uncompromising&quot; commenting that &quot;one cannot treat her roughly or reason with her a lot.&quot;

===Education===

Maria was educated at the Russian court under the strict regime of her governess, Countess Alexandra Tolstaya. Maria was the first Russian grand duchess to be raised by English nannies and to speak fluent English. Besides her native Russian, she also became totally proficient in German and French. In August 1867, while the imperial family was at Livadia Palace, in Crimea, Mark Twain met Maria and her parents. The famous American writer described her as &quot;blue-eyed, unassuming, and pretty&quot;. As many contemporaries did, Twain noticed the influence that the young Grand Duchess had over her father.

==Engagement==

===Meeting Prince Alfred===

During a visit to her maternal relatives, the Princes of Battenberg, at Jugenheim in August 1868, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, then fourteen years old, met Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Alfred, Queen Victoria&#x27;s second son, was a shy and handsome young man, with a career in the British navy. He was visiting his sister, Princess Alice, who was married to Maria&#x27;s first cousin. Alfred&#x27;s voyage around the world with the Royal Navy kept him away, traveling for the next two years. Maria and Prince Alfred saw each other again in the summer 1871, when Alexander II and his wife visited the Battenbergs again at their palace. The Emperor and Empress were accompanied by seventeen-year-old Maria and her two elder brothers. Alfred also happened to be there, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales. During that summer, Maria and Alfred felt attracted to each other, spending their days walking and talking together. They had a common love of music; Alfred was an enthusiastic amateur violinist, while Maria played the piano. Although they wished to marry, no engagement was announced, and Alfred returned to England. Their parents were against the match. Alexander II did not want to lose his daughter, to whom he was deeply attached. He presented his daughter&#x27;s youth as the main obstacle and suggested a waiting period of at least one year before any definitive decision should be taken. The Emperor also objected to a British son-in-law, due to the general anti-British feeling in Russia following the Crimean War. The Empress regarded British customs as peculiar and the English people as cold and unfriendly. She was convinced that her daughter would not be happy there. However, marriage negotiation began in July 1871, only to be stalled in 1872.

===Negotiations===

Queen Victoria was also against the match. No British prince had ever married a Romanov; she foresaw problems with Maria&#x27;s Orthodox religion and Russian upbringing. The Queen considered that Russia was generally &quot;unfriendly&quot; towards Britain and she was also suspicious about Russian moves in the direction of India. Victoria was dismayed, therefore, when she heard that official negotiations had restarted in January 1873. There were rumors going about Saint Petersburg that Maria had compromised herself with Prince Nikolai Golitsyn, the Emperor&#x27;s aide-de-camp, and her family were anxious to see her settled. Alfred refused to believe those rumors and he was prepared to fight to marry the person he loved. Queen Victoria therefore swallowed her pride and said nothing. Both mothers continued to look for other partners for their children, but Alfred and Maria would not have anyone else. Maria liked neither the Prince of Württemberg nor the Prince of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who were presented to her as alternatives. As the Empress failed to find a German prince acceptable for her daughter, a meeting among Alfred, the Empress and her daughter took place in Sorrento, Italy, in mid-April 1873. The reunion did not go as planned because Maria came down with fever and Alfred could spend only a short time with her. That year, there was an Anglo-Russian dispute over the Afghan border. The Queen&#x27;s ministers thought that a marriage might help to ease the tension between the two countries, if only by putting the monarchs into closer contact with one another.

In June 1873, Alexander II joined his wife and daughter at Ems, and Alfred was invited to meet them at Jugenheim. Alfred arrived in early July. On 11 July, he asked for Maria&#x27;s hand and she accepted him. He was nearly twenty-nine; she was nineteen. He sent a telegram from Germany back to his mother: &quot;Maria and I were engaged this morning. Cannot say how happy I am. Hope your blessing rests on us.&quot; The Queen sent her congratulations, but confined her misgivings to her diary on 11 July 1873: &quot;Not knowing Marie, and realizing that there may still be many difficulties, my thoughts and feelings are rather mixed.&quot; When breaking the news to her eldest daughter, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, Queen Victoria simply said: &quot;The murder is out.&quot;

===Dowry===

Alexander II granted his daughter the then-staggering sum of £100,000 as dowry, plus an annual allowance of £32,000. He also bestowed on his only daughter some of the best jewels owned by the Romanovs, including the sapphires he had inherited from his mother, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (née Princess Charlotte of Prussia) and a parure that had belonged to Catherine the Great. As a wedding present, the Emperor commissioned a complete parure of diamonds and Burmese rubies from the court jeweller Bolin. Her other pieces of jewellery included a kokoshnik made of diamonds, which could also be worn as a necklace. George Greville, 4th Earl of Warwick later recalled that &quot;I saw the finest jewels I have ever seen in my life&quot; when he visited Maria&#x27;s home in Eastwell and that &quot;One would have thought that the world had been ransacked to lay these treasures at the Duchess’s feet, and there seemed to be enough for an entire royal family rather than for one member of it.” Alexander II gave Maria an extravagant trousseau that cost £40,000. It included &quot;50 magnificent dresses, not including ball-dresses, to say nothing of the splendid furs and lace at 1,000 roubles a yard.&quot; He made Alfred honorary colonel of a Russian guards regiment and even named a Russian battleship after him – the &quot;Gerzog Edinburgsky&quot;.

A week after the engagement, the proposed Anglo-Russian alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Emperor to bring Maria to Scotland, so that she could meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Empress suggested that they all meet in Cologne, instead. Victoria called it &quot;simply impertinent&quot; that &quot;I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be ready to run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess.&quot; Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Emperor&#x27;s offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in Saint Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria looked forward happily to her marriage: &quot;How happy I am to belong to him. I feel that my love for him is growing daily. I have a feeling of peace and inexpressible happiness and a boundless impatience to be altogether his own.&quot;

==Marriage==

On 4 January 1874, Alfred arrived in Saint Petersburg for the wedding and stayed at the Winter Palace. The other British guests arrived on 18 January. The wedding was celebrated in great splendour, at the Grand Church of the Winter Palace on . Queen Victoria was represented by her eldest son, Albert Edward, and his wife Alexandra, sister of Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna (née Princess Dagmar of Denmark). The Queen&#x27;s eldest daughter, Victoria, and her husband Frederick, Crown Prince of Germany, were present as well.

The marriage ceremony consisted of two parts. The Orthodox service took place first and was performed by the Metropolitans of Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Kiev in the Imperial Chapel. Grand Dukes Vladimir, Alexei, and Sergei and the groom&#x27;s brother Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, relieved each other taking turns holding the golden crowns over the head of the bride and groom. Maria wore a glittering coronet and a mantle of crimson velvet trimmed with ermine and a sprig of myrtle, specially sent by Queen Victoria. Alfred wore the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Emperor looked pale throughout the entire ceremony and said afterwards: &quot;It is for her happiness, but the light of my life has gone out.&quot; After this, the bride and groom each drank thrice from a goblet of wine. The service concluded with the couple joining hands under the priest&#x27;s stole. Then they all proceeded to the Alexander Hall, where Arthur P. Stanley, Dean of Westminster, made Alfred and Maria husband and wife according to the rites of the Church of England. The two services were followed by a banquet at the palace. The famous opera singer Adelina Patti sang for the guests. The evening ended with a ball at Saint George Hall.

In England that night, Queen Victoria wore the Order of Saint Catherine on her dress and drank a toast to the young couple. Those members of her court who had traveled to Saint Petersburg were overwhelmed by the scale of the celebrations, receptions and entertainments marking the Anglo-Russian marriage. Major-General Sir Howard Craufurd Elphinstone noted that, in one room, supper was served to five hundred people at fifty different tables, with &quot;palms and exotics ... used to so large an extent that it gives the place the appearance of a conservatory ... the heat of the rooms was almost unbearable, and several ladies left the ballroom in a fainting state.&quot; Lady Augusta Stanley summed up the wedding in three words: &quot;What a day.&quot;

Alfred and Maria spent their wedding night at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo. Alexander II had ordered a lavish honeymoon suite on the ground floor, hoping that it would persuade the young couple to remain in Russia. After a short honeymoon in Tsarskoe Selo, however, Alfred and Maria left Russia to live in England. Alexander II never lost hope that they would return, and the honeymoon suite was kept preserved for the couple for two decades. In 1894, it became the bedroom of the last Emperor and his wife, Nicholas II and Alexandra, who were Maria&#x27;s nephew and Alfred&#x27;s niece respectively.

==Duchess of Edinburgh==

===Arrival in England===

The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh arrived in England on 7 March 1874. The town of Windsor was decorated in their honour, with Union Jacks and Russian flags, and Maria was given a great welcome by the waiting crowds. Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: &quot;I took dear Marie in my arms and kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long had I been in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ... She speaks English wonderfully well.&quot; Later on, Queen Victoria described her new daughter-in-law as &quot;most pleasing natural, unaffected and civil&quot; even if &quot;she was not pretty or graceful and held herself badly&quot;. &quot;I have formed a high opinion of her,&quot; Queen Victoria reported, impressed with &quot;her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper – her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind – so entirely free from everything fast – and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion. Everyone must like her.&quot; The Queen also noted that Maria was &quot;not a bit afraid of Affie and I hope will have the very best influence upon him.&quot;

The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh made their public entry into London on 12 March. Thousands lined the route from Paddington Station to Buckingham Palace to take a glimpse of the new British princess.

Alfred and Maria moved into Clarence House in London, which was their main residence in England. An Orthodox Chapel was installed for her and the Russian priest she had brought from Saint Petersburg. In addition, they had a country house, Eastwell Park, a large estate of 2,500 acres near Ashford in Kent, where the Duke enjoyed shooting parties.

To alleviate his daughter&#x27;s homesickness, the Emperor and his son Grand Duke Alexei paid a family visit to England in May 1874.

===The Duchess and Queen Victoria===

Maria often squabbled with her mother-in-law on how she should be addressed at court. As the daughter of an emperor, she was an Imperial Highness who had precedence over all the grand duchesses in Russia. Once she married her husband, she was only entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Emperor Alexander II alleged that his daughter should continue to be styled as an Imperial Highness, not Royal Highness, &quot;as in all civilized countries&quot;. Queen Victoria replied that she did not care whether imperial was used or not, as long as royal came first. There was also the added problem that Maria was both Duchess of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess of Russia, and which title should be written first was a controversial matter.

In retaliation for the quarrel over precedence, the Duchess of Edinburgh took great pleasure in showing off her magnificent jewellery. The British princesses were clearly jealous of her diamonds, as was Queen Victoria. Meriel Buchanan, daughter of the last British ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Maria&#x27;s first Drawing Room: &quot;The Queen compared the Duchess’s tiara with those of her own daughters, shrugging her shoulders like a bird whose plumage has been ruffled, her mouth drawn down at the corners, in an expression which those who knew her had learned to dread.&quot;

When she visited Scotland, Maria was frozen in her unheated bedroom in Balmoral Castle and ordered a fire to be lit. When she was out, Queen Victoria entered the room and ordered a maid to throw water on the fire and open all the windows.

Maria&#x27;s relationship with her mother-in-law deteriorated. She wrote letters to her father describing Queen Victoria as a &quot;silly obstinate old fool&quot;. Empress Maria was angry with Queen Victoria and wrote, &quot;To be quite frank, it is difficult to take such a mother-in-law seriously, and I am sorry on Marie&#x27;s account.&quot; Maria&#x27;s daughter, Queen Marie of Romania, reflected that, &quot;I do not think my mother always found it easy being Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter-in-law, though they had great respect for each other.&quot;

Maria was angry that Queen Victoria opposed the marriage of her granddaughter Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine to Maria&#x27;s favorite brother, Grand Duke Sergei. In August 1883, she wrote, &quot;that happy and so entirely satisfactory... prospect of marriage of my brother Sergei is going I think to fall through, under the deplorable influence of the Queen... I knew that from the start she set her heart against it saying that she had only heard his praise, but he had the greatest of all misfortunes, he was Russian and she had enough of one Russian in the family (meaning me, of course).&quot;

===At the British court===
Maria had five children. Nine months after the wedding, she gave birth to her first child and only surviving son, young Alfred, at Buckingham Palace on 15 October 1874. Her mother came to London during the confinement to visit Maria and meet her grandson. On 29 October 1875 at Eastwell Park, she gave birth to her second child and first daughter, whom she named Marie after herself and her mother. Maria shocked British society by nursing the children herself. While the Duchess was in Malta with her husband who was stationed there as an officer in the Royal Navy, she gave birth to her second daughter, Victoria Melita, on 25 November 1876. On 1 September 1878, she gave birth to her third daughter, Alexandra, at Rosenau Palace in Coburg. On 13 October 1879, Maria gave birth prematurely to a stillborn son at Eastwell Park. On 20 April 1884, she gave birth to her fourth daughter, Beatrice, also at Eastwell Park. Years later, she lamented that she only had five children: &quot;The only real heavenly moment is the birth of the child. This cannot be compared to anything else. I think if I had even a dozen children, I would have kept the same feeling.&quot;

The family&#x27;s main residence was Clarence House. Autumn, Christmas and the New Year were spent at Eastwell Park. On summer holidays, the family went to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

In 1877, Russia went to war with the Ottoman Empire in an attempt to gain control of the Balkans. Queen Victoria sent Emperor Alexander II a series of aggressive telegrams that almost led to a state of war between the two countries. The Duchess was deeply shocked at her mother-in-law&#x27;s hostility towards her country and her own father in particular.

Maria found it difficult to settle at the British court. Her mother wrote that &quot;Marie thinks London hideous... the air there appalling, the English food abominable, the later hours very tiring, the visits to Windsor and Osborne boring beyond belief.&quot; Maria described London as &quot;an impossible place, where people are mad of pleasure&quot; and a let down compared to the broad streets, golden domes, and magnificent palaces of Saint Petersburg. In her eyes, Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle could never compete with the splendours of the Winter Palace. Constant visits to her mother-in-law at Windsor Castle and Osborne House were tedious. Although she loved music, the duchess did not like the Royal Albert Hall, describing it as &quot;all ecclesiastical and ... quite boring ... Every concert goes on for several hours&quot;. During a banquet at Marlborough House, she had a conversation with the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. When Disraeli identified his rival, she exclaimed, &quot;What a strange state society is in here. Wherever I go there is a double. Two Prime Ministers, two Secretaries of State, two Lord Chamberlains, and two Lord Chancellors.&quot;

Maria disliked her in-laws. Queen Victoria&#x27;s company was oppressive, and of her sisters- and brothers-in-law, she only cared for the two youngest: Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice. Proud of her strong intellect, she considered Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, a light-minded and foolish woman.

Maria became increasingly homesick for Russia and was happy for any excuse to return there. She spoke of her “Russian heart&quot; and said that &quot;every sympathetic voice from the Fatherland is sacred to me.&quot; Her daughter, Queen Marie of Romania, reflected that &quot;my mother dearly loved her native country, and she never really felt completely happy in England.&quot;

British people thought her rough and masculine in her manners. Her imperious attitude towards her servants and her defiance of English convention by smoking in public made her unpopular. She made it equally plain that she did not care what people thought.
The Duke of Edinburgh was the heir presumptive of his childless uncle Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, elder brother of Prince Albert. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Maria resided in Coburg for a long while, as her husband was expected to succeed his aging uncle. On 17 February 1880, Maria was back in Russia, during the 25th anniversary celebration of her father&#x27;s coronation. That day, radicals attempted to assassinate the Emperor and the entire imperial family. A terrorist bomb demolished the dining room and the guard room at the Winter Palace. Maria returned to Russia again in June 1880, to be with her dying mother. She was back in England at Clarence House when her father was killed by a terrorist bomb. Maria had to rush back to Russia to attend the funeral in Saint Petersburg in March 1881. The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were present at the coronation of her brother, Emperor Alexander III, in Moscow in May 1883. In July 1884, they traveled to Ilinskoe, outside Moscow, to visit Grand Duke Sergei, Maria&#x27;s younger brother, who had married Queen Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter and Alfred&#x27;s niece, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine.

===In Malta===
In January 1886, the Duke was appointed commander-in-chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, based in Malta. In October 1886, the family settled there. For the next three years, they spent every winter at the San Anton Palace in Malta. Life in the island was unexciting for the Duchess of Edinburgh, but it was a welcome respite from living in England. While in Malta, the Duchess proved to be an excellent hostess, entertaining naval officers and their wives. In 1887, the couple returned briefly to London to take part in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. Her husband&#x27;s career in the British navy and their many relations in the European courts allowed Maria to travel extensively, something that she truly enjoyed. She visited most European countries, including Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, and even Montenegro, as well as making annual trips to Germany, England, and Russia.

==Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha==

===In Devonport===

In March 1887, the Duke relinquished his command of the Mediterranean Fleet, and the family moved to Coburg. Their main residence was Edinburgh Palais, where the Duchess held court. Her husband, occupied with his naval affairs, was away most of the time. Responsibility for the education of the couple&#x27;s five children fell upon the Duchess. She was a strict, but devoted mother who made sure to be the most important person in her children&#x27;s lives. Between August 1890 and June 1893, the Duke was stationed at the Royal Navy&#x27;s base in Devonport. Maria did not care for the Admiralty House, her husband&#x27;s official residence, and only made rare visits to Devonport with her children.

With the passing of the years, Alfred and Maria grew apart. They had little in common other than a shared interest in music and their children. He was reserved, taciturn, moody, ill-tempered, and a heavy drinker. By the mid-1880s he was an alcoholic. The Duke was described as &quot;rude, touchy, willful, unscrupulous, improvident, and unfaithful.&quot; The Duchess resented her husband&#x27;s attitude, but kept her marriage going, hiding her troubled married life from her children, providing a happy environment for them. She later confessed to one of her daughters that she felt she was never anything more than her husband&#x27;s &quot;legitimate mistress&quot;. Arguments over their children added to the couple&#x27;s marital problems. The Duke hoped that their eldest daughter, Marie, would marry his nephew, the future King George V. The Duchess, however, was determined that her daughter should avoid her mistake, and married her instead to Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania on 10 January 1893.

===In Coburg and Gotha===

Upon the death of his paternal uncle on 22 August 1893, the Duke of Edinburgh inherited the vacant throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, his elder brother, the Prince of Wales, having deferred his right to the succession. With her husband&#x27;s ascension to the ducal throne, Maria became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in addition to being Duchess of Edinburgh. Unlike her husband, who was disgruntled to leave his career in the navy, Maria thoroughly enjoyed her new role. She found the country &quot;charming&quot; and the prospect of &quot;a new fine position, with plenty to do&quot; a &quot;real God-send&quot;. Known for its hunting forest and picturesque castles, the ducal property was relatively small, compromising separate estates in Coburg, Gotha, Upper Austria, and Tyrol, but there she could live according to her desires in a domain of her own. The family moved to Ehrenburg Palace, the duke&#x27;s official residence, but they all preferred their summer house, Rosenau Palace, a gingerbread-yellow villa on a hill with views of the surrounding countryside. There were also two residences in Gotha where they had to live part of the year: Friedenstein Palace and Reinhardsbrunn, which the Duke enjoyed for its hunting grounds. The Duchess took on updating the badly furnished castles, and also charitable works, opening an establishment for those with intellectual disabilities that bore her name. Her passions were the opera and the theater, which she supported both in Coburg and in Gotha. The Duchess was also an avid reader and enjoyed mushroom hunting.

The main family residence in Coburg was a building that had been acquired for Prince Alfred&#x27;s use in 1865. Known as Edinburgh Palais, it was across the central square from the Ehrenburg Palace, the official residence of the reigning duke, and next to the town&#x27;s opera hall. It was extensively remodelled in 1881 to accommodate the couple&#x27;s growing family. The royal couple&#x27;s rooms were on the second floor, while the bedrooms of the four young princesses were on the third floor. Both the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were avid collectors. In Edinburgh Palais, there were many objects that reminded Maria of her homeland. She also organised entertainment in the Russian fashion.
Alfred and Maria&#x27;s second daughter, Victoria Melita, married Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse on 19 April 1894. The Duchess was initially against this match as Ernest was close to his British grandmother, Queen Victoria, who arrived at Coburg with many other royals for the wedding. In November 1894, Marie&#x27;s eldest brother, Alexander III, died of nephritis, aged forty-nine, leaving his twenty-six-year-old son, Nicholas II, as the new emperor. Alfred and Maria went to Russia, arriving just before Alexander III&#x27;s death. They stayed on in Saint Petersburg for the wedding of Nicholas to his fiancée, Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, the youngest surviving daughter of Alfred&#x27;s deceased sister, Princess Alice.

Over her husband&#x27;s objections, the Duchess arranged the marriage of her third daughter, Alexandra, in September 1895, to Ernst II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a grandson of Queen Victoria&#x27;s half-sister, Feodora. He was an attaché at the German embassy in London and his family was mediatized but not a reigning royal family. The Duchess&#x27;s main concern was her wayward only son, &quot;Young Alfred&quot;, who had a checkered career in the Imperial German Army. On 15 October 1895, he reached his majority, but he was already in bad health. Alexandra&#x27;s wedding took place in Coburg in April 1896, and the following month, Maria travelled to Russia with her husband and their other four children for Emperor Nicholas II&#x27;s coronation in Moscow. In June 1897, the Duchess and her husband went back to London to take part in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. By then, the couple&#x27;s relationship had deteriorated further. Maria despaired in finding a topic of conversation with her difficult husband as he hated her interest in literature and the theater, while she found his fondness for politics and hunting &quot;dull&quot;. The Duchess was relieved when her husband was away. She wrote to her eldest daughter &quot;if only you knew how easy and comfortable life is without him.&quot; By 1898, the Duke&#x27;s health had deteriorated, exacerbated by his excessive smoking and drinking.

===Family tragedies===

On 23 January 1899 Maria and her husband celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary at Friedenstein Palace in Gotha. Absent from the festivities was their only son, who was gravely ill. Young Alfred was a junior officer in Potsdam, where his chief hobbies were gambling, drinking and womanizing. He had contracted syphilis in 1892, and by 1898, his health deteriorated rapidly. He died at the age of twenty-four on 6 February 1899 in Meran, after reportedly shooting himself at Gotha during his parents&#x27; wedding anniversary celebrations. The Duke was heartbroken at Young Alfred&#x27;s death. This tragedy drove the parents farther apart as Alfred blamed his wife, who had been responsible for Young Alfred&#x27;s education. In her grief, the Duchess sank to her knees sobbing uncontrollably during her son&#x27;s funeral. With the death of Young Alfred, the heir to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was Alfred&#x27;s nephew Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, who came to Germany to be educated there. The succession to the duchy was complicated by the news that Alfred himself had throat cancer, too advanced for any treatment. By May 1900, he was unable to swallow and could only be fed by a tube. The Duchess and their youngest daughter, Beatrice, who were in England visiting Queen Victoria, returned on 17 July, unaware of the seriousness of the Duke&#x27;s condition. On 30 July 1900, he died in his sleep at Rosenau Palace in Coburg. Maria was at his bedside with their daughters Victoria Melita, Alexandra, and Beatrice. Maria became Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, while the duchy went to Alfred&#x27;s nephew Charles Edward, then sixteen years old. During his minority, the regency fell on Maria&#x27;s son-in-law, Prince Ernest of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, for nearly five years.

==Last years==

Maria was only forty-six years old when she became a widow. After the death of her husband, she stayed for a while in England, where she had to relinquish Clarence House which was inherited by her brother-in-law, the Duke of Connaught. Maria was at Osborne House during the final days of her mother-in law, Queen Victoria. In her widowhood, she kept Edinburgh Palais as her home in Coburg, and Friedenstein Palace in Gotha. Rosenau Palace continued to serve as her country house. However, she spent most of her time at her villa overlooking a lake in Tegernsee, Bavaria. Her winter residence was the Château de Fabron, near Nice. The upkeep of five residences put a strain on her finances.

Although she was critical of her daughters, she supported them during their personal crises. In 1901, her second daughter Victoria Melita divorced her husband and came to live with her. On 25 September 1905, Victoria Melita married her maternal first cousin, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. The Dowager Duchess&#x27;s relationship with her nephew Emperor Nicholas II deteriorated, as he opposed Victoria Melita&#x27;s second marriage, and it doomed the romance between Princess Beatrice and his younger brother, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich.

Maria lamented that, after working hard for the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg, and clearing its finances, the duchy passed to Charles Edward who took control of it at his majority in July 1905. Relations with the new duke were initially tense, but improved when Charles Edward provided his full support to the marriage of Maria&#x27;s youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice to Alfonso de Orleans y Borbón, Infante of Spain on 15 July 1909. In the following years, the Dowager Duchess continued to make frequent trips to her native Russia in order to stay with her daughter, Victoria Melita. The last one of her trips took place in May 1914.

At the outbreak of World War I, Maria was in Coburg after returning from a visit to King George V in Buckingham Palace. Her sympathies were divided, but she sided with Germany against her native Russia. The Coburg family faced intense hostility during the war for their British and Russian connections. The Dowager Duchess&#x27; position in Coburg became untenable as Russophobia took over the German Empire. To avoid complications, Maria stayed away from Coburg, retiring to Tegernsee in Bavaria. At one point, while she was returning home with her two younger daughters, their car was stopped by an angry mob who recognised her and harassed her for her Russian heritage. It took the police over an hour to extricate them from the situation. After that incident Maria went to live in exile in Switzerland at the Walhaus, an annex of the Dolder Grand Hotel in Zürich.

In August 1917 she wrote: &quot;At the age of 63, I am very fresh in mind, if not in body, and I can support with patience and resignation a sad and perhaps miserable end of life which is in store for my old age... Sometimes I also seem to despair, but not about myself, but about the state of things in general.&quot; Many of her relatives were killed during the Russian Revolution, including her only surviving brother Grand Duke Paul, and her nephew Emperor Nicholas II with his immediate family. In the aftermath of the war, the Dowager Duchess lost her large fortune as the bulk of it was held in trust in Russia. Her British income was small, and as she never saw a penny of it, she was forced to sell a great part of her jewellery collection.

Living under reduced circumstances in Zürich, Maria was reunited with her two eldest daughters, Marie and Victoria Melita, who had been on the opposite side during the war. In July 1920, she wrote: &quot;I am too utterly disgusted with the present state of the world and mankind in general... They have destroyed and ruined my beloved Russia, my much-loved Germany.&quot; She was a broken woman, her figure, always plump, became thin and her hands trembling. Although she had been affected by gastric troubles, her death came unexpectedly. Seven days after her sixty-seventh birthday, on 24 October 1920, she died in her sleep of a heart attack. She was buried beside her husband and their son in the ducal mausoleum at &quot;&quot; in Coburg. &quot;She was profoundly religious,&quot; her eldest daughter wrote, &quot;I hope God will not disappoint her as most things and beings did in this life.&quot;

Maria&#x27;s letters to her third daughter, Alexandra, are preserved in the Hohenlohe Central Archive (Hohenlohe-Zentralarchiv Neuenstein) in Neuenstein Castle in the town of Neuenstein, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

<text>Rajinder Singh Rai (; born February 14, 1969), better known by his stage name Panjabi MC, is a British-Indian recording artist, rapper, record producer and DJ. He is best known for the worldwide Bhangra 2002 hit &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot;, which sold 10 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. Among other songs, he gained acclaim with the 2003 release &quot;Jogi&quot;. AllMusic has called him &quot;one of the most prominent names in bhangra&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Career ===
Rajinder Singh adopted his stage name from the Punjabi language he uses in the music he plays and raps. &quot;One of [his] main goals is to fuse the two worlds [of Bhangra and Hip hop music genres]&quot;.

Nachural Records signed Panjabi MC following a remix he made of &quot;Ghariah Milan De&quot;, a song by Indian Punjabi singer Kuldeep Manak; although the single was taken off the market, Panjabi MC continued making records. The first successful release, however, was &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; (&quot;Beware of the Boys&quot; in Punjabi): it first appeared on the 1998 album &quot;Legalised&quot;, and samples the theme music of the television series &quot;Knight Rider&quot; with Bhangra music. Originally, an underground hit on the internet, it was picked up by the German record label &quot;Superstar Recordings&quot;, and became a mainstream hit song across Europe, including Germany and UK. 

In 2003 was released a version of this single featuring American rapper Jay-Z, whose title was &quot;Beware of the Boys&quot;; in the same year he released Yogi, a song which had not the success of the previous single but also topped the charts. His work, particularly the early singles and the &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; version with Jay-Z, brought Bhangra to a global audience via the BBC; he later continued to produce and remix music. 

In 2004, he recorded a song called &quot;Mirza&quot; and mixed it with &quot;Isyankar&quot;, a song by Turkish singer Mustafa Sandal, but they did not release the remixed version. In 2008 was released Panjabi MC&#x27;s album &quot;Indian Timing&quot;; the &quot;Snake Charmer&quot; music video was screened at Deejay Ra&#x27;s music video night in Toronto at the FILMI festival, North America&#x27;s longest running South Asian film festival.

=== Remixes and samples made by Panjabi MC in his songs ===
Panjabi MC used &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, a 1982 song by Afrika Bambaataa, for his release &quot;Pyar Wich (Planet Rock Remix)&quot;, before the latter could record &quot;Indian Planet Rock&quot;; this version by British-born Indian Dj&#x27;s was included on the 1998 album &quot;Legalised&quot;. On &quot;Indian Timing&quot;, Panjabi MC used vocal samples from &quot;Im Nin&#x27;alu&quot;, a 1984 song by Israeli singer Ofra Haza. On &quot;Jatt Ho Giya Sharabee&quot;, a song released in 1998, Panjabi MC used the theme music from the television series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;. In &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot;, along with the subsequent remix version featuring Jay-Z &quot;Beware of the Boys&quot;, the Dj used the bassline from the television series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. Both the last two songs were on the album &quot;Legalised&quot;, released in 1998.

=== Media use of Panjabi MC&#x27;s songs ===
The 1998 single &quot;Jatt Ho Giya Sharabee&quot;, included later on the 2003 album &quot;Beware&quot;, was featured on the television show &quot;Heroes&quot; (episode 2, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, aired on October 2, 2006). The 2001 song &quot;Yaaran Kollon Sikh Kuriye&quot; was featured in the television show &quot;Wildboyz&quot; as a music video. In the same year, Panjabi MC made his Canadian premiere at the &quot;Payal Banquet Hall&quot; in Mississauga, Ontario. Deejay Ra hosted a TV special covering the event entitled &quot;The Bhangramentary&quot;, which aired on the Asian Television Network (ATN). The 1998/2002 single &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; was featured in an episode of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; television series and in the 2002 movie &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;; it also was featured, in the remix version of &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; with Jay-Z, on the soundtrack of the 2021 BAFTA-nominated Netflix film &quot;The White Tiger&quot;. Panjabi MC has also appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, from which the &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; videoclip began to appear on music channels around the world in heavy rotation. 

Together with Sukhwinder Singh and Sapna Awasthi, Panjabi MC remixed the popular song &quot;Chaiyya Chaiyya&quot; from the 1998 Bollywood film, &quot;Dil Se..&quot;. This release was used as the background during opening credits for the 2006 Hollywood movie &quot;Inside Man&quot;. Their song &quot;Land of Five Rivers&quot; (the exact translation of Punjab, Panjabi MC&#x27;s original land) was used as a theme song for the WWE wrestler The Great Khali, and featured on &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="436935" wikidata="Q5775296" url="?curid=436935" title="History of Birmingham">
<text>Birmingham has seen 1400 years of growth, during which time it has evolved from a small 7th century Anglo Saxon hamlet on the edge of the Forest of Arden at the fringe of the early Mercia into a major city. A combination of immigration, innovation and civic pride helped to bring about major social and economic reforms and create the Industrial Revolution, inspiring the growth of similar cities across the world.

The last 200 years have seen Birmingham rise from market town to the fastest-growing city of the 19th century, spurred on by a combination of civic investment, scientific achievement, commercial innovation and by a steady influx of migrant workers into its suburbs. By the 20th century Birmingham had become the metropolitan hub of the United Kingdom&#x27;s manufacturing and automotive industries, having earned itself a reputation first as a city of canals, then of cars, and most recently as a major European convention and shopping destination.

At the beginning of the 21st century, Birmingham now lies at the heart of a major post-industrial metropolis surrounded by significant educational, manufacturing, shopping, sporting and conferencing facilities.

==Prehistory==

===Stone Age===

The oldest human artefact found within Birmingham is the Saltley Handaxe: a 500,000-year-old brown quartzite hand axe about long, discovered in the gravels of the River Rea at Saltley in 1892. Other parts of Birmingham are quite similar in this way, as people seem to have lived there for millennia . This provided the first evidence of Lower Paleolithic human habitation of the English Midlands, an area previously thought to have been sterile and uninhabitable before the end of the last glacial period. Similarly aged axes have since also been found in Erdington and Edgbaston, and bioarchaeological evidence from boreholes in Quinton, Nechells and Washwood Heath suggests that the climate and vegetation of Birmingham during this interglacial period were very similar to those of today.

The area became uninhabitable with the advancing glaciation of the last ice age, and the next evidence of human habitation within Birmingham dates from the Mesolithic period. A 10,400-year-old settlement – the oldest within the city – was excavated in the Digbeth area in 2009, with evidence that hunter-gatherers with basic flint tools had cleared an area of forest by burning. Flint tools from the later Mesolithic period – between 8000 and 6000 years ago – have been found near streams in the city, though these probably represent little more than hunting parties or overnight camps.

The oldest man-made structures in the city date from the Neolithic era, including a possible cursus identified by aerial photography near Mere Green, and the surviving barrow at Kingstanding. Neolithic axes found across Birmingham include examples made of stone from Cumbria, Leicestershire, North Wales and Cornwall, suggesting the area had extensive trading links at the time.

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
Stone axes used by the area&#x27;s first farmers over 5,000 years ago have been found within the city and the first bronze axes date from around 4,000 years ago. Pottery dating back to 2700BC has been found in Bournville.

The most common prehistoric sites in Birmingham are burnt mounds – a form characteristic of upland areas and possibly formed by the heating of stones for cooking or steam bathing purposes. Forty to fifty have been found in the Birmingham area, all but one datable to the period 1700–1000 BC. Burnt mound sites such as that discovered in Bournville also show evidence of wider settlements, with clearances in the woodland and grazing animals. Possible Bronze Age settlements with later Iron Age farmsteads have been discovered at Langley Mill Farm in Sutton Coldfield. Further evidence of Iron Age settlement has been found at Berry Mound, a hill fort located in the Bromsgrove district of Worcestershire, near Shirley.

==Romano-British era, c. 47–c. 600==

In Roman times a large military fort and marching camp, Metchley Fort, existed on the site of the present Queen Elizabeth Hospital near what is now Edgbaston in southern Birmingham. The fort was constructed soon after the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. In AD 70, the fort was abandoned only to be reoccupied a few years later before being abandoned again in AD 120. Remains have also been found of a civilian settlement, or &quot;vicus&quot;, alongside the Roman fort. Excavations at Parson&#x27;s Hill in Kings Norton and at Mere Green have revealed a Roman kiln site.

Although no archeological evidence has been found, the presence of the Old English prefix &quot;wīc-&quot; in Witton (&quot;wīc-tūn&quot;) suggests that it may have been the site of a significant Romano-British &quot;vicus&quot; or settlement, which would have been adjacent to the crossing of the River Tame by Icknield Street at Perry Barr.

Roman military roads have been identified converging on the Birmingham area from &quot;Letocetum&quot; (Wall, near Lichfield) in the north; from &quot;Salinae&quot; (Droitwich) in the south east; from &quot;Alauna&quot; (Alcester) in the south, and from &quot;Pennocrucium&quot; (Penkridge) in the north west. In many places the courses of these roads – including the points where they met – have been lost as they pass through the urban area, though a section of the route from Wall is well preserved as it passes through Sutton Park. Roads are also likely to have led via the known Roman settlements at Castle Bromwich and Grimstock Hill near Coleshill to &quot;Manduessedum&quot; (Mancetter), and to the fort at Greensforge near Kinver. The existence of straight road alignments coinciding with early parish boundaries suggests another Roman road may have passed through Birmingham from east to west through Ladywood, Highgate and Sparkbrook, along the line of Ladywood Road, Belgrave Road and parts of Warwick Road. The Roman routes from Wall and Alcester were together named Icknield Street during the later Medieval period, though the implication that they were viewed as a single route by the Romans may be misleading, and it is possible that the road from Droitwich was originally the more important of the two southern routes.

==Anglo-Saxon and Norman Birmingham, c. 600–1166==

===Foundation===
Archaeological evidence from the Anglo Saxon era in Birmingham is slight and documentary records of the era are limited to seven Anglo-Saxon charters detailing the outlying areas of King&#x27;s Norton, Yardley, Duddeston and Rednal. Place name evidence, however, suggests that it was during this period that many of the settlements that were later to make up the city, including Birmingham itself, were established.

The name &quot;Birmingham&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;Beormingahām&quot;, meaning the home or settlement of the &quot;Beormingas&quot; – a tribe or clan whose name literally means &quot;Beorma&#x27;s people&quot; and which may have formed an early unit of Anglo-Saxon administration. Beorma, after whom the tribe was named, could have been its leader at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, a shared ancestor, or a mythical tribal figurehead. Place names ending in &quot;-ingahām&quot; are characteristic of primary settlements established during the early phases of Anglo-Saxon colonisation of an area, suggesting that Birmingham was probably in existence by the early 7th century at the latest. Surrounding settlements with names ending in &quot;-tūn&quot; (farm), &quot;-lēah&quot; (woodland clearing), &quot;-worð&quot; (enclosure) and &quot;-field&quot; (open ground) are likely to be secondary settlements created by the later expansion of the Anglo-Saxon population, in some cases possibly on earlier British sites.

===Anglo-Saxon settlement===
The site of Anglo-Saxon and Domesday Birmingham is not known. The traditional view – that it was a village based around the crossing of the River Rea at Deritend, with a village green on the site that became the Bull Ring – has now largely been discredited, and not a single piece of Anglo-Saxon material was found during the extensive archeological excavations that preceded the redevelopment of the Bull Ring in 2000. Other locations have been suggested including the Broad Street area; Hockley in the Jewellery Quarter; or the site of the Priory of St Thomas of Canterbury, now occupied by Old Square. Alternatively early Birmingham may have been an area of scattered farmsteads with no central nucleated village, or the name may originally have referred to the wider area of the Beormingas&#x27; tribal homeland, much larger than the later manor and parish and including many surrounding settlements. Analysis of the pre-Norman linkages between parishes suggests that such an area could have extended from West Bromwich to Castle Bromwich, and from the southern boundaries of Northfield and King&#x27;s Norton to the northern boundaries of Sutton Coldfield.

During the early Anglo-Saxon period the area of the modern city lay across a frontier separating two peoples. Birmingham itself and the parishes in the centre and north of the area were probably colonised by the &quot;Tomsaete&quot; or &quot;Tame-dwellers&quot;, who were Anglian tribes who migrated along the valleys of the Trent and the Tame from the Humber Estuary and later formed the kingdom of Mercia. Parishes in the south of the current city such as Northfield and King&#x27;s Norton were colonised during a later period by the Hwicce, a Saxon tribe whose migration north through the valleys of the Severn and Avon followed the West Saxons&#x27; victory over the Britons at the Battle of Dyrham in 577. The exact boundary between the two groups may not have been precisely defined, but is likely to be indicated by the boundaries of the later dioceses of Lichfield and Worcester established after the 7th century conversion of Mercia to Christianity.

The late 7th century saw the kingdom of Mercia expand, absorbing the Hwicce by the late 8th century and eventually coming to dominate most of England, but the growth of Viking power in the later 9th century saw eastern Mercia fall to the Danelaw, while the western part, including the Birmingham area, came to be dominated by Wessex. During the 10th century Edward the Elder of Wessex reorganised western Mercia for defensive purposes into shires based around the fortified burhs established by his sister Æthelflæd. The Birmingham area again found itself a border region, with the parish of Birmingham forming part of the Coleshill Hundred of newly created Warwickshire, but other areas of the modern city falling within Staffordshire and Worcestershire.

===The Domesday manor===
The first surviving documentary record of Birmingham is in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is recorded as the small manor of &quot;Bermingeham&quot;, worth 20 shillings.


At the time of the Domesday survey, Birmingham was far smaller than other villages in the area, most notably Aston. Other local manors recorded in the Domesday survey were Sutton, Erdington, Edgbaston, Selly, Northfield, Tessall and Rednal. A settlement called &quot;Machitone&quot; is also mentioned in the survey: this was to later become Sheldon.

The manor-house of Birmingham was located at the foot of the eastern side of the Keuper Sandstone ridge. Originally a small house, it was later developed into a timber-framed house surrounded by a moat fed by the River Rea.

==The medieval market town, 1166–1485==

===Establishment and expansion===

The transformation of Birmingham from the purely rural manor recorded in Domesday Book started decisively in 1166, with the purchase by the lord of the manor, Peter de Birmingham, of a royal charter from Henry II permitting him to hold a weekly market &quot;at his castle at Birmingham&quot;, and to charge tolls on the market&#x27;s traffic. This was one of the earliest of the two thousand such charters that would be granted in England in the two centuries up to 1350, and may have recognised a market that was already taking place, as lawsuits of 1285 and 1308 both upheld the claim that the Birmingham market had been held without interruption since before the Norman conquest. Its significance remains, however, as Peter followed the investment with the deliberate creation of a planned market town within his &quot;demesne&quot;, or manorial estate.

This era saw the laying out of the triangular marketplace that became the Bull Ring; the selling of burgage plots on the surrounding frontages granting privileges in the market and freedom from tolls; the diversion of local trade routes towards the new site and its associated crossing of the River Rea at Deritend; the rebuilding of the Birmingham Manor House in stone and probably the first establishment of the parish church of St Martin in the Bull Ring. By the time Peter&#x27;s son William de Birmingham sought confirmation of the market&#x27;s status from Richard I twenty three years later, its location was no longer &quot;his castle at Birmingham&quot;, but &quot;the town of Birmingham&quot;.
The following period saw the new town expand rapidly in highly favourable economic circumstances. The Birmingham market was the earliest to be established on the Birmingham Plateau – an area which accounted for most of the doubling or tripling of the population of Warwickshire between 1086 and 1348 as population growth nationally encouraged the settlement and cultivation of previously marginal land. Surviving documents record the widespread enclosure of wasteland and clearance of woodland in King&#x27;s Norton, Yardley, Perry Barr and Erdington during the 13th century, a period over which the cultivated area of the manor of Bordesley also increased twofold. Demand for agricultural trade was further fuelled by the increasing requirement for rents to be paid in cash rather than labour, leading tenant farmers to sell more of their produce. It would be almost a century before markets at Solihull, Halesowen and Sutton Coldfield provided the Birmingham market with any local competition, and by then the success of Birmingham itself provided the model, with tenure at Solihull explicitly being granted &quot;according to the liberties and customs merchant of the market of Birmingham&quot;.
Within a century of the 1166 charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous town of craftsmen and merchants. The signing of Letters patent indicate visits by the King to Birmingham in 1189, 1235 and 1237, and two burgesses were summoned to represent the town in Parliament in 1275. This event was not repeated until the 19th century, but established Birmingham as a town of comparable significance to older Warwickshire towns such as Alcester, Coleshill, Stratford-upon-Avon and Tamworth. Fifty years later the lay subsidy rolls of 1327 and 1332 show Birmingham to have overtaken all of these towns to become the third largest in the county, behind only Warwick itself and Coventry – at the time the fourth largest urban centre in England.

===Markets and merchants===

Birmingham&#x27;s market is likely to have remained primarily one for agricultural produce throughout the medieval period. The land of the Birmingham Plateau, particularly the unenclosed area of the manor of Birmingham to the west of the town, was more suited to pastoral than arable agriculture and excavated animal bones indicate that cattle were the dominant livestock, with some sheep but very few pigs. References in 1285 and 1306 to stolen cattle being sold in the town suggest that the size of the trade at this time was sufficient for such sales to go unnoticed. Trade through Birmingham diversified as a merchant class arose, however: mercers and purveyors are mentioned in early 13th century deeds, and a legal dispute involving traders from Wednesbury in 1403 reveals that they were dealing in iron, linen, wool, brass and steel as well as cattle in the town.

By the 14th century Birmingham seems to have been established as a particular centre of the wool trade. Two Birmingham merchants represented Warwickshire at the council held in York in 1322 to discuss the standardisation of wool staples, and others attended the Westminster wool merchants assemblies of 1340, 1342 and 1343, a period when at least one Birmingham merchant was trading considerable amounts of wool with continental Europe. Aulnage records for 1397 give some indication of the size of Birmingham&#x27;s textile trade at the time, the 44 broadcloths sold being a tiny fraction of the 3,000 sold in the major textile centre of Coventry, but making up almost a third of the trade of the rest of Warwickshire.

Birmingham was also situated on several significant overland trade routes. By the end of the 13th century the town was an important transit point for the trade in cattle along drovers&#x27; roads from Wales to Coventry and the South East of England. Exchequer accounts for 1340 record wine imported through Bristol being unloaded at Worcester and transported by cart to Birmingham and Lichfield. This route from Droitwich is shown on the Gough Map of the mid-14th century and described by the contemporary Ranulf Higdon as forming part of one of the &quot;Four Great Royal Roads&quot; of England, running from Worcester to the River Tyne.

The de Birmingham family were active in promoting the market, whose tolls would have formed an important part of the income from the manor of Birmingham, by then the most valuable of their estates. The establishment of a rival market at Deritend in the neighbouring parish of Aston had led them to acquire the hamlet by 1270, and the family is recorded enforcing the payment of tolls by traders from King&#x27;s Norton, Bromsgrove, Wednesbury, and Tipton in 1263, 1308 and 1403. In 1250 William de Birmingham gained permission to hold a fair for three days about Ascensiontide. By 1400 a second fair was being held at Michaelmas and in 1439 the then lord negotiated for the town to be free of the presence of royal purveyors.

===Early industries===

Archaeological evidence of small-scale industries in Birmingham appears from as early as the 12th century, and the first documentary evidence of craftsmen in the town comes from 1232, when a group of burgesses negotiating to be released from their obligation to help with the Lord&#x27;s haymaking are listed as including a smith, a tailor and four weavers. Manufacturing is likely to have been stimulated by the existence of the market, which would have provided a source of raw materials such as hides and wool, as well as a demand for goods from prosperous merchants in the town and from visitors from the countryside selling produce. By 1332 the number of craftsmen in Birmingham was similar to that of other Warwickshire towns associated with industry such as Tamworth, Henley-in-Arden, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Alcester.

Analysis of craftsmen&#x27;s names in medieval records suggests that the major industries of medieval Birmingham were textiles, leather working and iron working, with archaeological evidence also suggesting the presence of pottery, tile manufacture and probably the working of bone and horn. By the 13th century there were tanning pits in use in Edgbaston Street; and hemp and flax were being used for making rope, canvas and linen. Kilns producing the distinctive local Deritend Ware pottery, examples of which can be seen in The Birmingham History Galleries, existed in the 12th and 13th centuries, and skinners, tanners and saddlers are recorded in the 14th century. The presence of slag and hearth bloom in pits excavated behind Park Street also suggests the early presence of working in iron. The borough rentals of 1296 provide evidence of at least four forges in the town, four smiths are mentioned on a poll tax return of 1379 and seven more are documented in the following century. Although fifteen to twenty weavers, dyers and fullers have been identified in Birmingham up to 1347, this is not a significantly greater number of cloth-workers than that found in surrounding villages and at least some of the cloth sold on the Birmingham market had rural origins. This was the first local industry to benefit from mechanisation, however, and nearly a dozen fulling mills existed in the Birmingham area by the end of the 14th century, many converted from corn mills, but including one at Holford near Perry Barr that was purpose-built in 1358.

While most manufactured goods would have been produced for a local market, there is some evidence that Birmingham was already a specialised and widely recognised centre of the jewellery trade during the medieval period. An inventory of the personal possessions of the Master of the Knights Templar in England at the time of their suppression in 1308 includes twenty two &quot;Birmingham Pieces&quot;: small, high value items, possibly jewellery or metal ornaments, that were sufficiently well known to be referred to without explanation as far away as London. In 1343 three Birmingham men were punished for selling base metal items while asserting they were silver, and there is documentary evidence of goldsmiths in the town in 1384 and 1460 – a trade that could not have been supported purely through local demand in a town of Birmingham&#x27;s size.

===Medieval institutions and society===

The growth of the urban economy of 13th century and early 14th century Birmingham was reflected in the development of its institutions. St Martin in the Bull Ring was rebuilt on a lavish scale around 1250 with two aisles, a clerestory and a high spire, and two chantries were endowed in the church by wealthy local merchants in 1330 and 1347. The Priory of St Thomas of Canterbury is first recorded in 1286, and by 1310 had received six major endowments of land totalling and 27 smaller endowments. The Priory was reformed in 1344 after criticism by the Bishop of Lichfield and a chantry was established in its chapel. St John&#x27;s Chapel, Deritend was established around 1380 as a chapel of ease of the parish church of Aston, with its priest supported by the associated Guild of St John, Deritend, which also maintained a school. The parish of Birmingham gained its own religious guild with the foundation in 1392 of the Guild of the Holy Cross, which provided a social and political focus for the elite of the town as well as supporting chaplains, almshouses, a midwife, a clock, the bridge over the River Rea and &quot;divers ffoule and daungerous high wayes&quot;.
Economic success also saw the town expand. New Street is first recorded in 1296, Moor Street was created in the late 13th century and Park Street in the early 14th century. Population growth was driven by rural migrants attracted by the opportunity of establishing themselves as traders, free from duties of agricultural labour. Analysis of rentals suggest that two-thirds came from within of the town, but others came from further afield, including Wales, Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire, Hampshire and even Paris. There is also some evidence that the town may have had a Jewish population before the Edict of Expulsion of 1290.
Although medieval Birmingham was never incorporated as a self-governing entity independent of its manor, the &quot;Borough&quot; – the built-up area – was governed separately from the &quot;Foreign&quot; – the open agricultural area to the west – from at least 1250. The burgesses of the town elected the two bailiffs; the &quot;commonalty of the town&quot; is first recorded in 1296 and a pavage grant of 1318 was made out not to the Lord of the Manor but &quot;to the bailiffs and good men of the town of Bermyngeham&quot;. The town thus remained free of the restrictive trade guilds of fully chartered boroughs, but was free also from the constraints of a strict manorial regime.

If the 12th and 13th centuries were a period of growth for the town, however, this ceased during the 14th century in the face of a series of calamities. The manorial court records of nearby Halesowen record a &quot;Great Fire of Birmingham&quot; between 1281 and 1313, an event possibly reflected in late 13th century pits containing large quantities of charcoal and charred and burnt pottery found beneath Moor Street. Famines of 1315 to 1322 and the Black Death of 1348–50 halted the growth in population and the decline in archaeological evidence of pottery from the 14th and 15th centuries may indicate a prolonged period of economic hardship.

==Tudor and Stuart Birmingham, 1485–1680==

===The early modern town===

The Tudor and Stuart eras marked a period of transition for Birmingham. In the 1520s the town was the third largest in Warwickshire with a population of about 1,000 – a situation little changed from that two centuries earlier. Despite a series of plagues throughout the 17th century, by 1700 Birmingham&#x27;s population had increased fifteenfold and the town was the fifth-largest in England and Wales, with a nationally important economy based on the expanding and diversifying metal trades, and a reputation for political and religious radicalism firmly established by its role in the English Civil War.
The principal institutions of medieval Birmingham collapsed within the space of eleven years between 1536 and 1547. The Priory of St Thomas was suppressed and its property sold at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, with the Guild of the Holy Cross, the Guild of St John and their associated chantries also being disbanded in 1547. Most significantly, the de Birmingham family lost possession of the manor of Birmingham in 1536, probably as a result of a feud between Edward de Birmingham and John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley. After brief periods in the possession of the Crown and the Duke of Northumberland, the manor was sold in 1555 to Thomas Marrow of Berkswell. Birmingham would never again have a resident Lord of the Manor, and the district as a whole was to remain an area of weak lordship throughout the following centuries. With local government remaining essentially manorial, the townspeople&#x27;s resulting high degree of economic and social freedom was to be a highly significant factor in Birmingham&#x27;s subsequent development.

The period was also one of significant cultural development. Although the dissolution of the Guild of St John in Deritend saw the closure of its associated school, the former hall of the Guild of the Holy Cross in New Street, together with property worth £21 per year from its estate, was saved for the establishment of King Edward&#x27;s Free Grammar School in 1552. John Rogers, born in Deritend in 1500, became the town&#x27;s first notable literary figure when he compiled and partially translated the &quot;Matthew Bible&quot;, the first complete authorised edition of the Bible to appear in the English language. The first Birmingham library had been established by 1642, the same year that Nathaniel Nye – the town&#x27;s first known scientist – published his &quot;New Almanacke and Prognostication calculated exactly for the faire and populous Towne of Birmicham in Warwickshire&quot;. Finally 1652 marks the first record of a Birmingham bookseller and the first Birmingham-published book: &quot;The Font Guarded&quot;, by the local puritan Thomas Hall.

===Industry and economy===
Although the leather and textile trades were still major features of the Birmingham economy in the early 16th century, the increasing importance of the manufacture of iron goods, as well as the interdependence between the manufacturers of Birmingham and the raw materials of the area that later became known as the Black Country, were recognised by the antiquary John Leland when he travelled through in 1538, providing the town&#x27;s earliest surviving eyewitness description.
The importance of the iron trades increased further as the century progressed, with most of the fulling mills in the Birmingham area being converted into mills for grinding blades by the end of the century. In 1586 William Camden described the town as &quot;swarming with inhabitants, and echoing with the noise of the anvils, for here are great numbers of smiths and of other artificers in iron and steel, whose performances in that way are greatly admired both at home and abroad&quot;.

Birmingham itself operated as the commercial hub for manufacturing activity which took place across the Birmingham Plateau, which itself formed the centre of a network of iron forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales and the Forest of Dean to Cheshire. While 16th century deeds record nailers in Moseley, Harborne, Handsworth and King&#x27;s Norton; bladesmiths in Witton, Erdington and Smethwick and scythesmiths in Aston, Erdington, Yardley and Bordesley; the ironmongers – the merchants who organised finance, supplied raw materials and marketed products, acting as middlemen between the smiths, their suppliers and their customers – were concentrated in the town of Birmingham itself. Birmingham ironmongers are recorded selling the Royal Armouries large quantities of bills as early as 1514; by the 1550s Birmingham merchants were trading as far afield as London, Bristol and Norwich, in 1596 Birmingham men are recorded selling arms in Ireland, and by 1657 the reputation of the Birmingham metalware market had reached the West Indies. By 1600 Birmingham ranked alongside London as one of the two great concentrations of iron merchants in the country, flourishing from its economic freedom and its proximity to manufacturers and raw materials, while London&#x27;s traders remained under the control of a powerful corporate body.

The concentration of iron merchants in Birmingham was significant in the development of the town&#x27;s manufacturing as well as its commercial activities. Able to serve a wider market due to the town&#x27;s extensive trading links, the metalworkers of Birmingham could diversify into increasingly specialised activities. Over the course of the 17th century the lower-skilled nail, scythe and bridle trades – producing basic iron goods for local agricultural markets – moved west to the towns that would later make up the Black Country, while Birmingham itself focused on an increasingly wide range of more specialist, higher-skilled and more lucrative activities. The hearth tax returns for Birmingham for 1671 and 1683 show the number of forges in the town increasing from 69 to 202, but the later figures also show a far wider variety of trades, including hiltmakers, bucklemakers, scalemakers, pewterers, wiredrawers, locksmiths, swordmakers, and workers in solder and lead. Birmingham&#x27;s economic flexibility was already apparent at this early stage: workers and premises often changed trades or practised more than one, and the presence of a wide range of skilled manufacturers in the absence of restrictive trade guilds encouraged the development of entirely new industries. The range of goods produced in late-17th century Birmingham, and its international reputation, were illustrated by the French traveller Maximilien Misson who visited Milan in 1690, finding &quot;fine works of rock crystal, swords, heads of canes, snuff boxes, and other fine works of steel&quot;, before remarking &quot;but they can be had better and cheaper at Birmingham&quot;.

===Politics, religion and civil war===

By the early 17th century Birmingham&#x27;s booming economy, dominated by the self-made merchants and manufacturers of the new metal trades rather than traditional landed interests; its expanding population and high degree of social mobility; and the almost complete absence from the area of a resident aristocracy; had seen it develop a new form of social structure very different from that of more traditional towns and rural areas: relationships were based more around pragmatic commercial linkages than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and the town was widely seen as one where loyalty to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy was weak. The first signs of Birmingham&#x27;s growing political self-consciousness can be seen from the 1630s, when a series of puritan lectureships provided a focus for questioning the doctrines and structures of the Church of England and had a widespread influence throughout surrounding counties. A 1640 puritan-inspired petition raised by the townspeople against the local Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas Holte provides the first evidence of conflict with the country gentlemen who dominated local government.

The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 saw Birmingham emerge as a symbol of puritan and Parliamentarian radicalism, with the Royalist Earl of Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England&quot; condemning the town as being &quot;of as great fame for hearty, wilful, affected dis-loyalty to the king, as any place in England&quot;. The arrival of 400 armed men from Birmingham was decisive in securing Coventry&#x27;s refusal to admit Charles I in August 1642, which established Warwickshire as a Parliamentarian stronghold. The march of the King and his army south from Shrewsbury in the days leading up to the Battle of Edge Hill in October 1642 met strong local resistance, with troops headed by Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the Earl of Derby being ambushed by local Trained bands in Moseley and King&#x27;s Norton, and the King&#x27;s baggage train attacked by Birmingham townspeople and his personal possessions plundered and transported to Warwick Castle while the King stayed with the Royalist Sir Thomas Holte at Aston Hall. The strategic importance of Birmingham&#x27;s metal trades was also significant: one report suggested that the town&#x27;s main mill had manufactured 15,000 swords solely for the use of Parliamentarian forces.
Royalist revenge was exacted on Easter Monday, 3 April 1643, when Prince Rupert returned to Birmingham with 1,200 cavalry, 700 footsoldiers and 4 guns. Twice repulsed by the small force of 200 defenders behind hastily erected earthworks, the Royalist cavalry outflanked the defences and overran the town in the Battle of Birmingham, before burning 80 houses and leaving behind the naked corpses of fifteen townspeople. Although the Royalist victory was militarily insignificant, and came at the expense of the death of the Earl of Denbigh, the resistance of a largely civilian force against the royalist cavalry, and the subsequent sack of the town, presented the Roundheads with a major propaganda boost that was eagerly exploited by a series of widely circulated pamphlets.

During the later years of the Civil War the subversive potential of Birmingham&#x27;s manufacturing-based society was personified by the local parliamentarian colonel John &quot;Tinker&quot; Fox, who recruited a garrison of 200 men from the Birmingham area and occupied Edgbaston Hall from 1643. From there he attacked and removed the Royalist garrison from nearby Aston Hall, established control over the countryside leading out to Royalist Worcestershire, and launched a series of audacious raids as far afield as Bewdley. Highly active, and operating largely independently of the parliamentarian hierarchy, to Royalists Fox came to symbolise a dangerous and uncontrolled overturning of the established order, with his background in the Birmingham metal trades seeing him caricatured as a tinker. By 1649 his national notoriety was such that he was widely rumoured to have been Charles I&#x27;s executioner.

==The Midlands Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, 1680–1791==

===Enlightenment, Nonconformism and industrial innovation===

The 18th century saw the sudden emergence of Birmingham at the forefront of worldwide developments in science, technology, medicine, philosophy and natural history as part of the cultural transformation now known as the Midlands Enlightenment. By the second half of the century the town&#x27;s leading thinkers – particularly members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham such as Joseph Priestley, James Keir, Matthew Boulton, James Watt, William Withering and Erasmus Darwin – had become widely influential participants in the Republic of Letters, the free circulation of ideas and information among the developing pan-European and trans-Atlantic intellectual elite. The Lunar Society was &quot;the most important private scientific association in eighteenth-century England&quot; and the Midlands Enlightenment &quot;dominated the English experience of enlightenment&quot;, but also maintained close links with other major centres of the Age of Enlightenment, particularly the universities of the Scottish Enlightenment, the Royal Society in London, and scientists, philosophers and academicians in France, Sweden, Saxony, Russia and America.
This &quot;miracle birth&quot; has traditionally been seen as a result of Birmingham&#x27;s status as a stronghold of religious Nonconformism, creating a free-thinking culture unconstrained by the established Church of England. This accords with wider historical theories such as the Merton thesis and the Weber thesis, which see Protestant culture as a major factor in the rise of experimental science and industrial capitalism within Europe. Birmingham had a vigorous and confident Nonconformist community by the 1680s, at a time when freedom of worship for Nonconformists nationally had yet to be granted; and by the 1740s this had developed into an influential group of Rational Dissenters. Around 15% of households in Birmingham were members of Nonconformist congregations in the mid-18th century, compared to a national average of 4–5%. Presbyterians and Quakers in particular also had a level of influence within the town that was disproportionate to their numbers, customarily holding the position of Low Bailiff – the most powerful position in the town&#x27;s local government – from 1733, and making up over a quarter of the Street Commissioners appointed in 1769, despite being legally barred from holding office until 1828. Despite this, Birmingham&#x27;s Enlightenment was by no means a purely Nonconformist phenomenon: the members of the Lunar Society had a wide range of religious backgrounds, and Anglicans formed a majority of all sections of Birmingham society throughout the period.
Recent scholarship no longer sees the Midlands Enlightenment as primarily having an industrial or technological focus. Analysis of the subject-matter of Lunar Society meetings shows that its main concern was with pure scientific investigation rather than manufacturing, and the influence of Midlands Enlightenment thinkers can be seen in areas as diverse as education, the philosophy of mind, Romantic poetry, the theory of evolution and the invention of photography. A distinctive and significant feature of the Midlands Enlightenment, however, that partly resulted from Birmingham&#x27;s unusually high level of social mobility, was the close relationship between the practitioners of theoretical science and those of practical manufacturing. The Lunar Society included industrialists such as Samuel Galton, Jr. as well as intellectuals such as Erasmus Darwin and Joseph Priestley; scientific lecturers such as John Warltire and Adam Walker communicated basic Newtonian principles widely to the town&#x27;s manufacturing classes; and men such as Matthew Boulton, James Keir, James Watt and John Roebuck were simultaneously highly regarded both as scientists and as technologists, and in some cases also as businessmen. The intellectual climate of 18th century Birmingham was therefore unusually conducive to the transfer of knowledge from the pure sciences to the technology and processes of manufacturing, and the feeding back of the results of this to create a &quot;chain reaction of innovation&quot;.
The Midlands Enlightenment therefore occupies a key cultural position linking the expansion of knowledge of the earlier Scientific Revolution with the economic expansion of the Industrial Revolution. 18th century Birmingham saw the widespread and systematic application of reason, experiment and scientific knowledge to manufacturing processes to an unprecedented degree, resulting in a series of technological and economic innovations that transformed the economic landscape of a wide variety of industries, laying many of the foundations for modern industrial society. In 1709 Abraham Darby I, who had trained as an apprentice in Birmingham and worked in Bristol for the Birmingham ironmonger Sampson Lloyd, moved to Coalbrookdale in Shropshire and established the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron with coke. In 1732 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt invented roller spinning – the &quot;one novel idea of the first importance&quot; in the development of the mechanised cotton industry – and in 1741 they opened the world&#x27;s first cotton mill in Birmingham&#x27;s Upper Priory. In 1765 Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Manufactory, pioneering the combination and mechanisation of previously separate manufacturing activities under one roof through a system known as &quot;rational manufacture&quot;. By the end of the decade this was the largest manufacturing unit in Europe with over 1,000 employees, and the foremost icon of the emerging factory system. John Roebuck&#x27;s 1746 invention of the lead chamber process first enabled the large-scale manufacture of sulphuric acid, while James Keir pioneered the manufacture of alkali at his plant in Tipton; between them these two developments marked the birth of the modern chemical industry.
The most notable technological innovation of the Midlands Enlightenment, however, was the 1775 development by James Watt and Matthew Boulton of the industrial steam engine, which incorporated four separate technical advances to allow it to cheaply and efficiently generate the rotary motion needed to power manufacturing machinery. Freeing the productive potential of society from the limited capacity of hand, water and animal power, this was arguably the pivotal development of the entire industrial revolution, without which the spectacular increases in economic activity of the subsequent century would have been impossible.

===Commercial and industrial expansion===

The explosive industrial growth of Birmingham started before that of the textile towns of the North of England and can be traced as far back as the 1680s. Birmingham&#x27;s population quadrupled between 1700 and 1750. By 1775 – before the start of the mechanisation of the Lancashire cotton trade – Birmingham was already the third most-populous town in England, smaller only than the older southern ports of London and Bristol and growing faster than any of its rivals. As early as 1791 Birmingham was being described by the economist Arthur Young as &quot;the first manufacturing town in the world&quot;.

The factors that drove Birmingham&#x27;s rapid industrialisation were also different from those behind the later development of textile manufacturing towns such as Manchester, whose spectacular growth from the 1780s onwards was based on the economies of scale inherent in mechanised manufacture: the ability of a low-wage, unskilled labour force to produce bulk commodities such as cotton in huge quantities. Although the developments that enabled this transformation – roller spinning, the factory system and the industrial steam engine – often had Birmingham origins, they had little role in Birmingham&#x27;s own expansion. Birmingham&#x27;s relatively inaccessible location meant that its industries were dominated by the production of a wide variety of small, high value metal items – from buttons and buckles to guns and jewellery. Its economy was characterised by high wages and a diverse range of specialised skills that were not susceptible to wholesale automation. The small-scale workshop, rather than the large factory or mill, remained the typical Birmingham manufacturing unit throughout the 18th century, and the use of steam power was not economically significant in Birmingham until the 1830s.
Rather than low wages, efficiency and scale, Birmingham&#x27;s manufacturing growth was fuelled by a highly skilled workforce, specialisation, flexibility and, above all, innovation. The low barriers to entry to the Birmingham trades gave the town a high degree of social mobility and a distinctly entrepreneurial economy; the contemporary William Hutton described trades that &quot;spring up with the expedition of a blade of grass, and, like that, wither in the summer&quot;. In terms of manufacturing technology Birmingham was by far the most inventive town of the era: between 1760 and 1850 Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other town or city. Despite the landmark inventions of engineers such as James Watt, most of these developments are better characterised as part of a continuous flow of small-scale technological improvements. Matthew Boulton remarked in 1770 how &quot;by the many mechanical contrivances and extensive apparatus wh we are possess&#x27;d of, our men are enabled to do from twice to ten times the work that can be done without the help of such contrivances&quot;. Innovation also took place in production processes, particularly in the development of an extreme division of labour. Contemporary sources noted that in Birmingham even simple products such as buttons would pass through between fifty and seventy different processes, performed by a similar number of different workers. The resulting competitive advantage was noticed by Lunar Society member Richard Lovell Edgeworth when he visited Paris, observing that &quot;each artisan in Paris ... must in his time &#x27;play many parts&#x27;, and among these many to which he is incompetent&quot;, concluding that &quot;even supposing French artisans to be of equal ability and industry with English competitors, they are left at least a century behind&quot;.
Innovation also extended to Birmingham&#x27;s products, which were increasingly tailored to its merchants&#x27; national and international connections. During the first half of the century growth was largely driven by the domestic market and based on increased national prosperity, but foreign trade was important even in the mid-century and was the dominant factor from the 1760s and 1770s, dictated by the markets and fashions of London, France, Italy, Germany, Russia and the American colonies. The adaptability and speed to market of the Birmingham economy allowed it to be heavily influenced by fashion – the market for buckles collapsed in the late 1780s, but workers transferred skills to brass or button trades. Birmingham manufacturers sought design leadership in fashionable circles in London or Paris, but then priced their goods to appeal to the emerging middle class consumer economy; &quot;for the London season the Spitalfields silk weavers produced each year their new designs, and the Birmingham toy-makers their buttons, buckles, patchboxes, snuff boxes, chatelaines, watches, watch seals ... and other jewellery.&quot; Competitive pressure drove Birmingham manufacturers to adopt new products and materials: the town&#x27;s first glasshouse opened in 1762, manufacture in papier-mâché developed from the award of a patent to Henry Clay in 1772, foreshadowing the Birmingham invention of plastics the following century, the minting of coins grew from 1786.

In addition to its own specialist manufacturing role, Birmingham retained its position as the commercial and mercantile centre for an integrated regional economy that included the more basic manufacturing and raw material production areas of Staffordshire and Worcestershire. The demand for capital to feed rapid economic expansion saw the town become a major financial centre with extensive international connections. During the early 18th century finance was largely provided by the iron merchants and by extensive systems of trade credit between manufacturers; it was an iron merchant Sampson Lloyd and major manufacturer John Taylor who combined to form the town&#x27;s first bank – the early Lloyds Bank – in 1765. Further establishments followed and by 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London. Birmingham&#x27;s booming economy gave the town a growing professional sector, with the number of physicians and lawyers increasing by 25% between 1767 and 1788. It has been estimated that between a quarter and a third of Birmingham&#x27;s inhabitants could be thought of as middle class in the last quarter of the 18th century and this fuelled a large growth in the demand for tailors, mercers and drapers. Trade directories reveal that there more drapers than edge tool makers in 1767, and insurance records from 1777 to 1786 suggest that well over half of local businesses were engaged in the trading or service sectors rather than directly in industry.

===Enlightenment society===

Georgian Birmingham was marked by the dramatic growth of the vigorous public sphere for the exchange of ideas that was the hallmark of enlightenment society. Most characteristic was the development of clubs, taverns and coffeehouses as places for free association, cooperation and debate, often crossing lines of social class and status. Although the exceptional historic influence of the Lunar Society of Birmingham has made it much the best-known, the contemporary William Hutton described hundreds of such associations in Birmingham with thousands of members, and the German visitor Philipp Nemnich commented late in the century that &quot;the inhabitants of Birmingham are fonder of associations in clubs than almost any other place I know&quot;. Particularly notable examples included Freeth&#x27;s Coffee House, one of the most celebrated meeting places of Georgian England; Ketley&#x27;s Building Society, the world&#x27;s first building society, founded at the Golden Cross in Snow Hill in 1775; the Birmingham Book Club, whose radical politics saw it nicknamed the &quot;Jacobin Club&quot;, and which alongside other debating societies such as the Birmingham Free Debating Society and the Amicable Debating Society played a prominent role in the growing expression of popular political consciousness within the town; and the more conservative Birmingham Bean Club, a dining club uniting leading loyalist figures in the town with prominent landowners from the surrounding counties, which played a prominent role in the emergence of a distinct &quot;Birmingham interest&quot; in regional politics from 1774.
The printed word represented another expanding medium for the exchange of ideas. Georgian Birmingham was a highly literate society with at least seven booksellers by 1733, the largest in 1786 claiming a stock of 30,000 titles in several languages. These were supplemented by eight or nine commercial lending libraries established over the course of the 18th century, to the extent that it was claimed in the later part of the century that Birmingham&#x27;s population of around 50,000 read 100,000 books per month. More specialist libraries included St. Philip&#x27;s Parish Library established in 1733, and the Birmingham Library, established for research purposes in 1779 by a largely dissenting group of subscribers. Birmingham had been a centre for the printing and publishing of books since the 1650s but the rise of John Baskerville and the nine other printers he attracted to the town in the 1750s saw this achieve international significance. The town&#x27;s first newspaper was the &quot;Birmingham Journal&quot; founded in 1732; it was short-lived but notable as the vehicle for the first published work of Samuel Johnson. &quot;Aris&#x27;s Birmingham Gazette&quot;, founded in 1741, became &quot;one of the most lucrative and important provincial papers&quot; of 18th century England, and by the 1770s circulated as far afield as Chester, Birmingham and London. The more radical &quot;Swinney&#x27;s Birmingham Chronicle&quot;, which caused controversy in 1771 by serialising Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts on Religion&quot;, boasted in 1776 that it circulated across nine counties and was &quot;filed by coffeehouses in practically every centre of any size from Edinburgh southwards&quot;. News from outside the town also circulated widely: Freeth&#x27;s Coffeehouse in 1772 maintained an archive of all the London newspapers going back 37 years and received direct personal reports of proceedings in Parliament, while Overton&#x27;s Coffeehouse in New Street in 1777 had the London papers delivered by express messenger the day after their publication, also having available all of the main country, Irish and European papers, and Parliamentary division lists.

Birmingham&#x27;s booming economy attracted immigrants from a wide area, many of whom retained freeholds – and thus votes – in their previous constituencies, giving Birmingham politics a wide electoral influence despite the town having no parliamentary representation of its own. A distinct and powerful &quot;Birmingham interest&quot; emerged decisively with the election of Thomas Skipwith at the Warwickshire by-election of 1769, and over following decades candidates for seats as far afield as Worcester, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Leicester and Lincoln sought support in the town.

===Transport and the growth of the town===

The first map of Birmingham was produced in 1731 by William Westley, though the year before, he produced the first documentation of a newly constructed square named Old Square. It became one of the most prestigious addresses in Birmingham. This was not the first map to show Birmingham, something that had been done in 1335, albeit showing Birmingham as a small symbol. Birmingham was again surveyed in 1750 by S. Bradford.

Until the 1760s, Birmingham&#x27;s local government system, consisted of manorial and parish officials, most of whom served on a part-time and honorary basis. However this system proved completely inadequate to cope with Birmingham&#x27;s rapid growth. In 1768, Birmingham gained a rudimentary local government system, when a body of &quot;Commissioners of the Streets&quot; was established, who had powers to levy a rate for functions such as cleaning and street lighting. They were later given powers to provide policing and build public buildings.

From the 1760s onwards, Birmingham became a centre of the canal system. The canals provided an efficient transport system for raw materials and finished goods, and greatly aided the town&#x27;s industrial growth.

The first canal to be built into Birmingham, was opened in November 1769 and connected Birmingham with the coal mines at Wednesbury in the Black Country. Within a year of the canal opening, the price of coal in Birmingham had fallen by 50%.

The canal network across Birmingham and the Black Country expanded rapidly over the following decades, with most of it owned by the Birmingham Canal Navigations Company. Other canals such as the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, the Warwick and Birmingham Canal (now the Grand Union) and the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal linked Birmingham to the rest of the country. By 1830, some of canal had been constructed across the Birmingham and Black Country area.

Due to Birmingham&#x27;s vast array of industries, it was nicknamed &quot;workshop of the World&quot;. The expansion of the population of the town and the increased prosperity led to it acquiring a library in 1779, a hospital in 1766 and a variety of recreational institutions.

==Victorian Birmingham 1832–1914==
Horatio Nelson and the Hamiltons visited Birmingham. Nelson was fêted, and visited Matthew Boulton on his sick-bed at Soho House, before taking a tour of the Soho Manufactory and commissioning the Battle of the Nile medal. In 1809, a statue of Horatio Nelson by Richard Westmacott Jr. was erected by public subscription. It still stands, in the Bull Ring, albeit on a 1960s plinth.

The Birmingham Manor House and its moat were demolished and removed in 1816. The site was constructed upon to create the Smithfield Markets, which concentrated various marketing activities upon one area close to the Bull Ring which had developed into a retail-led area.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Birmingham had a population of around 74,000. By the end of the century it had grown to 630,000. This rapid population growth meant that by the middle of the century Birmingham had become the second largest population centre in Britain.
===Railways arrive===
Railways arrived in Birmingham in 1837 with the opening of the Grand Junction Railway which linked Birmingham with Manchester and Liverpool. The following year the London and Birmingham Railway opened, linking to the capital. This was soon followed by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway and the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway.

These all initially had separate stations around Curzon Street. However, in the 1840s, these early railway companies had merged to become the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway respectively. The two companies jointly constructed Birmingham New Street which was opened in 1854, and Birmingham became a central hub of the British railway system.

In 1852, the Great Western Railway (GWR) arrived in Birmingham, and opened their own station in central Birmingham, Birmingham Snow Hill. The GWR line linked the city with Oxford and London Paddington.

===Political reform===

Also in the 1830s, due to its growing size and importance, Birmingham was granted parliamentary representation by the Reform Act 1832. The new Birmingham constituency was created with two MPs representing it. Thomas Attwood and Joshua Scholefield both Liberals, were elected as Birmingham&#x27;s first MP&#x27;s.

In 1838, local government reform meant that Birmingham was one of the first new towns to be incorporated as a municipal borough by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. This allowed Birmingham to have its first elected town council. The council initially worked alongside the existing Street Commissioners, until they were wound up in 1851.

===Industry and commerce===
Birmingham&#x27;s growth and prosperity was based upon metal industries, of which many different kinds existed.

Birmingham became known as the &quot;City of a thousand trades&quot; because of the wide variety of goods manufactured there – buttons, cutlery, nails and screws, guns, tools, jewellery, toys, locks, and ornaments were amongst the many products manufactured.
For most of the 19th century, industry in Birmingham was dominated by small workshops rather than large factories or mills. Large factories became increasingly common towards the end of the century when engineering industries became increasingly important.

The industrial wealth of Birmingham allowed merchants to fund the construction of some fine institutional buildings in the city. Some buildings of the 19th century included: the Birmingham Town Hall built in 1834, the Birmingham Botanical Gardens opened in 1832, the Council House built in 1879, and the Museum and Art Gallery in the extended Council House, opened in 1885.

The mid-19th century saw major immigration into the city from Ireland, following the Great Irish Famine (1845–1849).

Birmingham became a county borough and a city in 1889.

===Improvements===
As in many industrial towns during the 19th century, many of Birmingham&#x27;s residents lived in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. During the early-to-mid-19th century, thousands of back-to-back houses were built to house the growing population, many of which were poorly built and badly drained, and many soon became slums.

In 1851, a network of sewers was built under the city which was connected to the River Rea, although only new houses were connected to it, and many older houses had to wait decades until they were connected.

Birmingham gained gas lighting in 1818, and a water company in 1826, to provide piped water, although clean water was only available to people who could pay. Birmingham gained its first electricity supply in 1882. Horse-drawn trams ran through Birmingham from 1873, and electric trams from 1890.
In the mid-1840s, the charismatic nonconformist preacher George Dawson began to promote a doctrine of social responsibility and enlightened municipal improvement that became known as the Civic Gospel. His philosophy inspired a group of reformers – including Joseph Chamberlain, Jesse Collings, George Dixon, and others – who from the late 1860s onwards began to be elected to the Town Council as Liberals, and to apply these ideas in practice. This period reached its peak during the mayoralty of Chamberlain, 1873–1876. Under his leadership, Birmingham was transformed, as the council introduced one of the most ambitious improvement schemes outside London. The council purchased the city&#x27;s gas and water works, and moved to improve the lighting and provide clean drinking water to the city, income from these utilities also provided a healthy income for the council, which was re-invested into the city to provide new amenities.

Under Chamberlain, some of Birmingham&#x27;s worst slums were cleared. And through the city-centre a new thoroughfare was constructed, Corporation Street, which soon became a fashionable shopping street. He was instrumental in building of the Council House and the Victoria Law Courts in Corporation Street. Numerous public parks were also created, central lending and reference libraries were opened in 1865–6, and the city&#x27;s Museum and Art Gallery in 1885. The improvements introduced by Chamberlain and his colleagues were to prove the blueprint for municipal government, and were soon copied by other cities. By 1890, a visiting American journalist could describe Birmingham as &quot;the best-governed city in the world&quot;. Although he resigned as mayor to become an MP, Chamberlain took close interest in the city for many years afterwards.

Birmingham&#x27;s water problems were not fully solved through the creation of reservoirs in Walmley Ash, fed by Plants Brook. Other larger reservoirs were constructed at Witton Lakes and Brookvale Park Lake to help ease the problems. The problems were finally solved, however, by Birmingham Corporation Water Department with the completion of a long Elan aqueduct was built to a reservoir in the Elan Valley in Wales; this project was approved in 1891 and completed in 1904.

==Wartime and interwar Birmingham, 1914–1945==
The First World War exacted a terrible human cost in Birmingham. More than 150,000 men from the city – over half of the male population – served in the armed forces of whom 13,000 were killed and 35,000 wounded. The onset of mechanised warfare also served to increase the strategic importance of Birmingham as a centre of industrial production, with the British Commander-in-Chief John French describing the war at its outset as &quot;a battle between Krupps and Birmingham&quot;. At the war&#x27;s close the Prime Minister David Lloyd George also recognised the significance of Birmingham in the allied victory, remarking how &quot;the country, the empire and the world owe to the skill, the ingenuity and the resource of Birmingham a deep debt of gratitude&quot;. Some Birmingham men were conscientious objectors.

In 1918, the Birmingham Civic Society was founded to bring public interest to bear upon all proposals put forward by public bodies and private owners for building, new open spaces and parks, and any and all matters concerned with the amenities of the city. The society set about making suggestions for improvements in the city, sometimes designing and paying for improvements themselves and buying a number of open spaces and later gifting them to the city for use as parks. Also in 1918, more than 100,000 munitions workers went on strike to oppose an embargo placed by the British government. This prompted the British government to threaten to draft them.

After the Great War ended in 1918, the city council decided to build modern housing across the city to rehouse families from inner city slums. Recent boundary expansions which brought areas including Aston, Handsworth, Erdington, Yardley and Northfield within the city&#x27;s boundaries provided extra space for housing developments. By 1939, the year that the Second World War broke out, almost 50,000 council houses had been built across the city within 20 years. Some 65,000 houses were also built for owner occupiers. New council estates built during this era included Weoley Castle between Selly Oak and Harborne, Pype Hayes near Erdington and the Stockfield Estate at Acocks Green.

In 1936, King Edward&#x27;s Grammar School on New Street was demolished and moved to Edgbaston. The school had been on that site for 384 years. The site was later transformed into an office block which was destroyed in the bombing of the Second World War. It was later rebuilt and named &quot;King Edward&#x27;s House&quot;. It is used as an office block and on the ground floor as shops and restaurants.

In the First and Second World Wars, the Longbridge car plant switched to production of munitions and military equipment, from ammunition, mines and depth charges to tank suspensions, steel helmets, Jerricans, Hawker Hurricanes, Fairey Battle fighters and Airspeed Horsa gliders, with the mammoth Avro Lancaster bomber coming into production towards the end of WWII. The Spitfire fighter aircraft was mass-produced at Castle Bromwich by Vickers-Armstrong throughout the war.

Birmingham&#x27;s industrial importance and contribution to the war effort may have been decisive in winning the war. The city was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe during the Birmingham Blitz in World War II. By the war&#x27;s end 2,241 citizens had been killed by the bombing and over 3,000 seriously injured. 12,932 buildings were destroyed (including 300 factories) and thousands more damaged. The air raids also destroyed many of Birmingham&#x27;s fine buildings. The council declared five redevelopment areas in 1946:
* Duddeston and Nechells
* Summer Lane
* Ladywood
* Bath Row
* Gooch Street

==Post-war prosperity, 1945–1975==

===Loss of independence and the prevention of growth===
The defining feature of Birmingham&#x27;s politics in the post-war era was the loss of much of city&#x27;s independence. World War II had seen a huge expansion in the role of central government in British life, and this pattern continued into the post-war years: for Birmingham, this meant major decisions about the city&#x27;s future tended to be made outside the city, mainly in Westminster. Planning, development and municipal functions were increasingly dictated by national policy and legislation; council finances came to be dominated by central government subsidies; and institutions such as gas, water and transport were taken out of the city&#x27;s control. Birmingham&#x27;s unrivalled size and wealth may have given it more political influence than any other provincial city, but like all such cities it was essentially subordinate to Whitehall; the days of Birmingham as a semi-autonomous city-state, with its leading citizens dictating the agenda of national politics, were over.

This was to have major implications for the direction of the city&#x27;s development. Up until the 1930s it had been a basic assumption of Birmingham&#x27;s leaders that their role was to encourage the city&#x27;s growth. Post-war national governments, however, saw Birmingham&#x27;s accelerating economic success as a damaging influence on the stagnating economies of the North of England, Scotland and Wales, and saw its physical expansion as a threat to its surrounding areas – &quot;from Westminster&#x27;s point of view [Birmingham] was too large, too prosperous, and had to be held in check&quot;. A series of measures, starting with the Distribution of Industry Act 1945, aimed to prevent industrial growth in the &quot;Congested Areas&quot; – essentially the booming cities of London and Birmingham – instead encouraging the dispersal of industry to the economically stagnant &quot;Development Areas&quot; in the north and west. The West Midlands Plan, commissioned by the Minister for Town and Country Planning from Patrick Abercrombie and Herbert Jackson in 1946, set Birmingham a target population for 1960 of 990,000, far less than its actual 1951 population of 1,113,000. This meant that 220,000 people would have to leave the city over the following 14 years, that some of the city&#x27;s industries would have to be removed, and that new industries would need to be prevented from establishing themselves in the city. By 1957 the council had explicitly accepted that it was obliged &quot;to restrain the growth of population and employment potential within the city&quot;.

With the city&#x27;s power over its own destiny reduced, Birmingham&#x27;s lost most of its political distinctiveness. The General Election of 1945 was the first for 70 years in which no member of the Chamberlain family stood for Birmingham.

===Economic boom and restriction===
Birmingham&#x27;s economy flourished in the 30 years that followed the end of the Second World War, its economic vitality and affluence far outstripping Britain&#x27;s other major provincial cities. Economic adaptation and restructuring over the previous half century had left the West Midlands well represented in two of the British economy&#x27;s three major growth areas – motor vehicles and electrical equipment – and Birmingham itself was second only to London for the creation of new jobs between 1951 and 1961. Unemployment in Birmingham between 1948 and 1966 rarely exceeded 1%, and only exceeded 2% in one year. By 1961 household incomes in the West Midlands were 13% above the national average, exceeding even than those of London and the South East.

This prosperity was achieved despite severe restrictions placed on the city&#x27;s economy by central government, which explicitly sought to limit Birmingham&#x27;s growth. The Distribution of Industry Act 1945 prohibited all industrial development over a specific size without an &quot;Industrial Development Certificate&quot;, in the hope that companies refused permission to expand in London or Birmingham would move instead to one of the struggling cities of the North of England. At least 39,000 jobs were directly transferred out of the West Midlands by factory movement between 1960 and 1974, and planning measures were instrumental in local firms such as the British Motor Corporation and Fisher and Ludlow expanding in South Wales, Scotland and Merseyside instead of Birmingham. Government measures also acted indirectly to deter economic development within the city: restrictions on the city&#x27;s physical growth in an era of economic boom led to extremely high land prices and shortages of premises and development sites, and moves to reduce the city&#x27;s population led to labour shortages and escalating wages.

Although employment in Birmingham&#x27;s restricted manufacturing sector shrank by 10% between 1951 and 1966, this was more than made up during the early post-war period for by employment in the service sector, which grew from 35% of the city&#x27;s workforce in 1951 to 45% in 1966. As the commercial centre of the country&#x27;s most successful regional economy, Central Birmingham was the main focus outside London for the post-war office building boom. Service sector employment in the Birmingham conurbation grew faster than in any other region between 1953 and 1964, and the same period saw 3 million sq ft of office space constructed in the city centre and Edgbaston. The city&#x27;s economic boom saw the rapid growth of a substantial merchant banking sector, as major London and international banks established themselves within the city, and professional and scientific services, finance and insurance also grew particularly strongly. However this service sector growth itself attracted government restrictions from 1965. Declaring the growth in population and employment within Birmingham to be a &quot;threatening situation&quot;, the incoming Labour Government of 1964 sought &quot;to control the growth of office accommodation in Birmingham and the rest of the Birmingham conurbation before it got out of hand, in the same way as they control the growth of industrial employment&quot;. Although the City Council had encouraged service sector expansion during the late 1950s and early 1960s, central government extended the Control of Office Employment Act 1965 to the Birmingham conurbation from 1965, effectively banning all further office development for almost two decades.

These policies had a major structural effect on the city&#x27;s economy. While government policy had limited success in preventing the growth of Birmingham&#x27;s existing industries, it was much more successful in preventing new industries establishing themselves in the city. Birmingham&#x27;s economic success over the previous two centuries had been built on its economic diversity and its ongoing ability to adapt and innovate – attracting new businesses and developing new industries with its large supply of skilled labour and dynamic entrepreneurial culture – but this was exactly the process that government industrial location policy sought to prevent. Birmingham&#x27;s existing industries grew strongly and kept the economy buoyant, but growing local fears that the city&#x27;s economy was becoming over-specialised were dismissed by central government, even though danger signs were growing by the early 1970s. In 1950 Birmingham&#x27;s economy could still be described as &quot;more broadly based than that of any city of equivalent size in the world&quot;, but by 1973 the West Midlands had an above-average reliance on large firms for employment, and the small firms that remained were increasingly dependent as suppliers and sub-contractors to the few larger firms. The &quot;City of Thousand Trades&quot; had become over-specialised on one industry – the motor trade – much of which by the 1970s had itself consolidated into a single company – British Leyland. Trade union organisation grew and the motor industry in particular saw industrial disputes from the 1950s onwards. A city that for most of its history had a reputation for weak trade unionism and strong cooperation between workers and management, developed a reputation for trade union militancy and industrial conflict.

Despite more than 150,000 houses being built in the city for both the private and public sector since 1919, 20% of the city&#x27;s homes were still deemed unfit for human habitation by 1954. 37,000 council properties had been built between 1945 and 1954 to rehouse families from the slums, but by 1970 the housing crisis was being eased as that figure had now exceeded 80,000.

During the 1960s and 1970s Birmingham entered into agreements with the existing towns of Reddich in Worcestershire, Tamworth in Staffordshire and Daventry in Northamptonshire to develop them to accommodate &#x27;overspill&#x27; population and industry from the city. The New Town of Telford in Shropshire was also developed in part on a greenfield site for this purpose.

===Planning and redevelopment===
In the postwar years, a massive program of slum clearances took place, and vast areas of the city were re-built, with overcrowded &quot;back to back&quot; housing being replaced by high rise blocks of flats (the last remaining block of four back-to-backs have become a museum run by the National Trust).

Due largely to bomb damage, the city centre was also extensively re-built under the supervision of the city council&#x27;s chief engineer Herbert Manzoni during the postwar years. He was assisted by the City Architect position which was held by several people. Emblematic of this was the new Bull Ring Shopping Centre. Birmingham also became a centre of the national motorway network, with Spaghetti Junction. Much of the re-building of the postwar period would in later decades be regarded as mistaken, especially the large numbers of concrete buildings and ringroads which gave the city a reputation for ugliness.

Council house building in the first decade following the end of the Second World War was extensive; with more than 37,000 new homes being completed between then and the end of 1954. These included the first of several hundred multi-storey blocks of flats. Despite this, some 20% of the city&#x27;s houses were still reported to be unfit for human habitation. As a result, mass council house building continued for some 20 years afterwards. The existing suburbs continued to expand, while several completely new estates were developed.

Castle Bromwich, which grew into a new town, was developed approximately six miles to the east of the town centre during the 1960s. Castle Vale, near the Fort Dunlop tyre factory to the north-east of the city centre, was developed in the 1960s as Britain&#x27;s largest postwar housing estate; featuring a total of 34 tower blocks, although 32 of them had been demolished by the end of 2003 as part of a massive regeneration of the estate brought on by the general unpopularity and defects associated with such developments.

In 1974, 21 people were killed and 182 others injured when two city-centre pubs were bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

In the same year as part of a local government reorganisation, Birmingham expanded again, this time taking over the borough of Sutton Coldfield to the north. Birmingham lost its county borough status and instead became a metropolitan borough under the new West Midlands County Council. It was also finally removed from Warwickshire.

===Immigration and cultural diversity===
There were further waves of immigration from Ireland in the 1950s and 1980s as emigrants sought to escape the economic deprivation and unemployment in their homeland. There remains a strong Irish tradition in the city, most notably in Digbeth&#x27;s Irish Quarter and in the annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade, claimed to be the third-largest in the world after New York and Dublin.

In the years following World War II, a major influx of immigrants from the Commonwealth of Nations changed the face of Birmingham, with large communities from Southern Asia and the Caribbean settling in the city, turning Birmingham into one of the UK&#x27;s leading multicultural cities.

The developments were not welcomed by everyone however – the right-wing Wolverhampton MP Enoch Powell delivered his famous Rivers of Blood speech in the city on 20 April 1968.

On the other hand, some arts prospered, especially music: Birmingham had thriving heavy metal (with bands such as Black Sabbath, Napalm Death and Judas Priest) and reggae scenes (notable locals including Steel Pulse, Pato Banton, Musical Youth, and UB40).

Since the early 1980s, Birmingham has seen a new wave of migration, this time from communities which do not have Commonwealth roots, such as Kosovo and Somalia. Further immigration from Eastern Europe (especially Poland) came with the expansion of the European Union in 2004.

Tension between ethnic groups and the authorities led to the Handsworth riots in 1981 and 1985. October 2005 saw the 2005 Birmingham riots in the Lozells and Handsworth regions of the city, with street battles between black and Asian gangs, caused by an unsubstantiated rumour resulting in two deaths and much damage.

The Birmingham City Council, further to the Local Strategic Partnership &#x27;Be Birmingham&#x27;, continue to strive towards a better, more united Birmingham.

==Post-industrial Birmingham 1975–==

The collapse of Birmingham&#x27;s industrial economy was sudden and catastrophic. As late as 1976 the West Midlands region – with Birmingham as its principal economic dynamo – still had the highest GDP of any in the UK outside the South East, but within five years it was lowest in England. Birmingham itself lost 200,000 jobs between 1971 and 1981, with the losses concentrated in the manufacturing sector; relative earnings in the West Midlands went from being the highest in Britain in 1970 to the lowest in 1983. By 1982 the city&#x27;s unemployment rate approached 20%, and was around twice that level in inner city areas including Aston, Handsworth and Sparkbrook.

The City Council undertook a policy of diversifying the city&#x27;s economy into service industries, retailing and tourism to lessen the dependence upon manufacturing. A number of initiatives were undertaken to make the city more attractive to visitors.

In the 1970s, the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) was built, 10 miles (16 km) southeast of the centre, close to Birmingham Airport. Although it is actually just inside neighbouring Solihull, it was instigated, and largely owned by, Birmingham Council, and is thought by most people to be in the city. It has been expanded several times since then.

Twenty-one people were killed and 182 injured in a series of bomb attacks in 1974, thought to be carried out by the Provisional IRA. The bombings were the worst terror attacks in Great Britain up until the 2005 London bombings and consisted of bombs being planted in two pubs in Central Birmingham. Six men were convicted, who became known later as the Birmingham Six and sentenced to life imprisonment, who were acquitted after 16 years by the Court of Appeal. The convictions are now considered one of the worst British miscarriages of justice in recent times. The true perpetrators of the attacks are yet to be arrested.

The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, which was responsible for the Birmingham Six investigations, attracted further controversy after other convictions were questioned, and was closed down in 1989. Around 40 prosecutions collapsed due to malpractice in the 1980s, and a further 60 convictions have since been quashed, mostly because of tampering with suspects&#x27; statements, to add in &#x27;confessions&#x27;. Many cases also depended on &#x27;Supergrass&#x27; evidence which has since been found to be highly unreliable. Some of those wrongfully convicted alleged torture, including use of a suffocation technique known as &quot;plastic bagging&quot;.

West Midlands Police had two serious firearms incidents, in 1980 and 1985. In 1980, David Pagett held his pregnant girlfriend as hostage while resisting arrest at flats in Rubery. Officers returned fire, and shot her. Police had initially tried to claim that Pagett has shot her, but it became clear that it was police bullets that had caused her death. In 1985, John Shorthouse was arrested by West Midlands police for questioning about armed robberies in South Wales. His house was then searched. His five-year-old son, John, was shot by police searching under the child&#x27;s bed. An internal inquiry was held, and as a result, use of firearms was restricted to a specialised and trained unit.
The International Convention Centre (ICC) opened in central Birmingham in the early 1990s. The area around Broad Street, including Centenary Square, the ICC and Brindleyplace, was extensively renovated at the turn of 2000. In 1998, the 24th G8 summit was held in Birmingham.

The regeneration of the city during the 1990s and 2000s also saw many residential areas of the city substantially altered. A notable example was the Pype Hayes council estate in the Erdington area of the city, which was built in the interwar years but was eventually completely redeveloped due to structural defects. Many of the city&#x27;s 1960s council properties, mostly multi-storey flats and maisonettes, have also been demolished in similar redevelopments, including the large Castle Vale estate in the north-east of the city, where all but two of the estate&#x27;s 34 tower blocks were demolished as part of the regeneration of an estate which had been blighted by crime, unemployment and poor housing.

The city was shocked, on 2 January 2003, by the murder of Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis. In September 2003, the Bullring shopping complex was opened following a three-year project. In 2003, the city failed in its bid to become the 2008 European Capital of Culture, under the banner &quot;Be in Birmingham 2008&quot;.

Birmingham continues to develop, following the removal of the Inner Ring Road, which acted as a &#x27;concrete collar&#x27; preventing the expansion of the city centre, a massive urban regeneration project known as the Big City Plan in progress. For example, in the city&#x27;s new Eastside district which is undergoing work which is expected to total £6 billion.

The city was affected by the riots that spread through the country in August 2011, resulting in extensive criminal damage in several inner city areas and three deaths in the Winson Green area.

<text>Zlatko Baloković (March 31, 1895 – March 29, 1965) was a Croatian violinist.

==Early years==
He was born in Zagreb, Croatia (at the time part of Austria-Hungary), and began violin lessons at age ten. He made such progress that, after three years, he was sent to Prague to continue his studies at the &quot;Meisterschule&quot; under the guidance of Otakar Ševčík. In 1913, already excellent and renowned, the invitation came to him to play with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. That year he won the annual Austrian &quot;Staatspreis&quot; and soon made artistic tours to Berlin, Vienna, and Genova. He stayed in Trieste during World War I. After living in Britain from 1920 to 1923, he accepted an offer for an American tour, so on January 1, 1924, he left for New York City. In the same year, he settled permanently in the United States. In 1926, he married Joyce Borden, heiress to the Borden family fortune. In the 1920s and 1930s, the couple toured the European continent, performing predominantly for the continent&#x27;s royalty.

==Political activism==
Upon the outbreak of World War II, he settled at Hillside Farm in Camden, Maine, where he became involved in many wartime political efforts and chaired six organizations: the Yugoslav Division of the U.S. Treasury War Bond Drives; the Russian War Relief&#x27;s Nationalities Division, the United Committee of South Slavic Americans; the American Slav Congress of Greater New York; the American Croatian Congress, and the American Committee for Yugoslav Relief (with Eleanor Roosevelt as the president). He advocated Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav cause. In November 1944, aided by Adlai Stevenson (his nephew by marriage), he went to Washington, D.C. to demand the shipment of medical supplies to the resistance forces. After seeing President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Vice President Henry A. Wallace, United States Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr., Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy and Admiral Land, the deal was done and the requested supplies soon reached their destination.

In 1946 the couple returned to Yugoslavia as officials of the American Committee for Yugoslav Relief and were showered with that nation&#x27;s gratitude. He gave 36 concerts and hundreds of speeches, while travelling the entire country in a private railroad car. He personally came to know many high-ranking figures in the Yugoslav government, including Marshal Josip Broz Tito, Georgi Dimitrov of Bulgaria, and Enver Hoxha of Albania.

Upon his return to the U.S. in 1947, he made a coast-to-coast tour to advocate for the people he had met. As a result of the ties to Yugoslav government and membership in wartime organizations, he had come to be considered &quot;subversive&quot;. The couple was labelled as &quot;fellow travellers&quot; by the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1949 but after an ordeal both were cleared. In 1954, he made a second &quot;jubilee&quot; tour. Tito presented him with the Grand Cross of the Yugoslav Flag in recognition of his artistic and humanitarian achievements benefiting nations.

He died in Venice on his way to Zagreb to celebration of his 70th birthday.

Baloković&#x27;s 1735 &quot;The King&quot; Guarneri violin is kept at the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb.

<text>Home Movies is an American animated sitcom created by Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard. The show centers on an eight-year-old aspiring filmmaker, also named Brendon Small, who makes homemade film productions in his spare time with his friends Melissa Robbins and Jason Penopolis. He lives with his divorced mother Paula and his adopted baby sister Josie. He develops a skewed father-son-like relationship with his alcoholic, short-tempered soccer coach, John McGuirk.

&quot;Home Movies&quot; premiered on UPN on April 26, 1999. UPN cancelled the series after only five episodes due to low ratings, but Cartoon Network purchased the rights to the series, seeing potential in it; the show premiered as the first original program on their nighttime adult-oriented Adult Swim block on the night of the block&#x27;s launch on September 2, 2001. The series ended on April 4, 2004, with a total of 52 episodes over the course of four seasons. The show was produced by Tom Snyder.

&quot;Home Movies&quot; developed a cult following during its run, and is still considered a renowned cult show, having been well-regarded by critics in the years since its run. Co-creator Small later helped create the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; and Bouchard later created the animated series &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; for the Fox network, casting H. Jon Benjamin (the voice of Coach McGuirk, Jason, and Perry) as the voice of Bob Belcher.

== Season plot summaries ==

=== Season one ===

Animated in Squigglevision and heavily using retroscripting, the first five episodes aired on UPN in 1999. The show introduced the main characters in this season, and mainly consisted of episodes revolving around Brendon&#x27;s movies. Much of the style of the writing is loose and improvised. The season ends with Brendon saying hello to his erstwhile absent father on the phone.

=== Season two ===

Now animated in Flash, this is the first season commissioned by Cartoon Network as a result of mixed ratings of season one reruns. The episodes are now heavily scripted, but the creators now have much more freedom, allowing for creative episodes (“History”), introducing new characters (Fenton Mulley, the Adelbergs) as well as a multiple-story season arc, which includes:
* Brendon meeting his father Andrew and his fiancée Linda, resulting in therapy sessions, leading up to a wedding.
* Brendon develops a crush on Scäb choreographer Cynthia, and tries to win her over.
* Paula loses her job and searches for a new one. Melissa&#x27;s dad offers some advice.
The show also develops a writing device that carries through the next seasons, in which the plots of one episode usually all have an underlying theme. Emphasis on Brendon&#x27;s movies becomes key here, and the subtext of their creation is finally discussed. At this point, Brendon is still enjoying his life making films and living in a fantasy world.

=== Season three ===

A bit looser than season two, the show loses the idea of a seasonal story arc, and many of the episodes air out of order. The episodes become racier, with more resounding sexual themes and cursing than before. Secondary characters, such as Fenton and Duane, are given more screen time, relative to the prior seasons. Another aspect is that the show begins to acknowledge actual movies more often than it had previously, and starts parodying them heavily. The season ends with Brendon&#x27;s stepmother Linda having a child, but afterwards she and Andrew no longer make appearances in the show.

=== Season four ===

The final season: the creators apparently knew they were getting canceled throughout the entire production of the final thirteen episodes. Many of the episodes are straight parodies of movies, including three allusions to Hitchcockian thrillers. The bulk of the episodes consist of plots that involve Brendon doing something other than making films. Part of this revolves around Brendon trying to figure out whether he still enjoys making movies, or if it is becoming more of a chore. An entire episode (&quot;Curses&quot;) dealt with swearing and adult themes. The loose dialogue and long conversations lessen for humorous plot devices and a speedier delivery at jokes and gags. The final episode (&quot;Focus Grill&quot;) was made in mind as a series finale, and brought back the long conversations and loose dialogue, as well as a resolution to the series as Brendon, Jason and Melissa finally make a conclusion to their first film, declaring their friendship before they come to the conclusion that their movies are not as good as they had always believed. Brendon accidentally drops his camera from a moving car while filming scenery in the final sequence and watches in distress as it gets run over, but is thereafter distracted from his grief by a discussion of fast food prompted by his mother and Coach McGuirk.

== Characters ==

== Style ==

In its first season, &quot;Home Movies&quot; utilized Soup2Nuts&#x27; Squigglevision animation but later abandoned that for the cheaper, more malleable Macromedia Flash animation. The switch was initiated for several reasons, including scattered negative response to Squigglevision from both critics and viewers, limitations in regard to movement (fluid motion is rare in Squigglevision), and the producers&#x27; view that since Squigglevision was inherent to &quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot;, &quot;Home Movies&quot; should develop its own unique style.

The dialogue of &quot;Home Movies&quot; initially relied upon spontaneous or &quot;ad-lib&quot; creation by the actors. The scripts were purposely left vague, with the plot of a particular scene merely outlined, and the dialogue improvised by the actors, with the animation then created and matched to the edited soundtrack. Bouchard referred to this process as &quot;retroscripting,&quot; a technique he had developed on &quot;Dr. Katz&quot;.&quot; The first episode was entirely improvised. Though retroscripting was used officially in only the first season, the dialogue in the following three seasons remained heavily improvised, with the written script serving mainly as a guide to fall back on for jokes if needed.

All music for the series was written and performed by Brendon Small.

== Music ==

The soundtrack for &quot;Home Movies&quot; was released May 16, 2006, and includes fifty-two songs which were featured throughout the series. The CD comes packaged with the DVD release of the show&#x27;s fourth season box set. All music was written by Brendon Small.

== Home releases ==
Season releases
Shout! Factory, through Sony BMG Music Entertainment, released DVDs of &quot;Home Movies&quot; seasons, each on three-disc box sets. Each DVD has numerous special features and easter eggs. Shout! Factory later on released all of the Home Movies episodes on Amazon Video on Demand. Seasons 2 through 4 are available for free streaming with a public library card on the Hoopla app and website in the United States. Some episodes are able to be streamed through the Adult Swim official website and app on a rotating basis. The series also joined HBO Max on May 27, 2020.

== Reception ==
The series has been highly regarded by critics upon and since its release. In 2009, IGN included it on their list of the top 100 animated series of all time. While reviewing the first season, &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted that &quot;The animation serves one of the most impressive aspects: the fact that it was largely improvised&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; praised the show&#x27;s dialogue and humor, saying &quot;&quot;Home Movies&quot; manages to set itself apart, offering clever dialogue and sharp social commentary.&quot;

<text>John Elliot Burns (20 October 1858 – 24 January 1943) was an English trade unionist and politician, particularly associated with London politics and Battersea. He was a socialist and then a Liberal Member of Parliament and Minister. He was anti-alcohol and a keen sportsman. When the Liberal cabinet made a decision for war on 2 August 1914, he resigned and played no further role in politics. After retiring from politics, he developed an expertise in London history and coined the phrase &quot;The Thames is liquid history&quot;.

==Early life==
Burns was born in London in 1858, the son of Alexander Burns, a Scottish fitter, growing up with his railwayman father in a house at 80 Grant Road, Battersea on what is now the Winstanley and York Road Estates. He attended a national school in Battersea until he was ten years old. He then had a succession of jobs until he was fourteen years old and started a seven-year apprenticeship to an engineer at Millbank and continued his education at night-schools. He read extensively, especially the works of Robert Owen, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Paine and William Cobbett. A French fellow-worker, Victor Delahaye, who had been present during the Paris Commune introduced him to socialist ideas, and Burns claimed that he was converted because he found the arguments of J. S. Mill against it to be insufficient. He began practising outdoor speaking, with the advantage of exceptional physical strength and a strong voice.

In 1878, he was arrested and held overnight for addressing an open-air demonstration on Clapham Common. He worked at his trade in various parts of England, having joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in 1879. In 1881 he formed a branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in Battersea. He worked on a ship, and went for a year to the West African coast at the mouth of the Niger as a foreman engineer for the United Africa Company. He disapproved of treatment of Africans and spent his earnings on a six months&#x27; tour to study political and economic conditions in France, Germany and Austria. 

==Radical politics==
In 1884 Burns was elected to the Social Democratic Federation&#x27;s executive council. At the Industrial Remuneration Conference of 1885 he made some interventions that attracted attention.

He stood for Parliament in the 1885 General Election at Nottingham West but was unsuccessful. A year later, he took part in a London demonstration against unemployment which resulted in the West End riots when the windows of the Carlton Club and other London clubs were broken, where he encouraged rioters to loot bakeries. He was arrested and later acquitted at the Old Bailey of charges of conspiracy and sedition. He was arrested again the following year on 13 November 1887 for resisting police attempts to break up an unlicensed meeting in Trafalgar Square. The demonstration ended in the &#x27;Bloody Sunday&#x27; clashes; Burns was imprisoned for six weeks.

In August 1889, Burns played a major part in the London Dock Strike. He was the most effective of the strikers&#x27; speakers, and each day after the meeting he led the strikers on a five abreast march through the City of London, wearing his trademark straw hat. By this time he had left the SDF and, with fellow socialist Tom Mann, was focusing on trade union activity as a leader of the New Unionist movement. With other London radicals such as Ben Tillett, Will Crooks, Ben Cooper and John Benn, Burns (&#x27;The Man with the Red Flag&#x27;) helped win the dispute. He was still working at his trade in Hoe&#x27;s printing machine works and was an active member of the executive of the Amalgamated Engineers&#x27; Union.

In 1889, he became a Progressive member of the first London County Council for Battersea. He was supported by his constituents, who subscribed an allowance of £2 a week. He devoted his efforts against private monopolies and introduced a motion in 1892 that all contracts for the County Council should be paid at trade union rates and carried out under trade union conditions. As a local politician, Burns is particularly noted for his role in the creation of Battersea&#x27;s Latchmere Estate, the first municipal housing estate built using a council&#x27;s own direct labour force, officially opened in 1903. He was connected with the Trades Union Congresses until 1895.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1892, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Battersea as the candidate of the Battersea Liberal Association. He displayed fervent Parliamentary opposition to the Second Boer War (1900).

Burns became well known as an independent Radical, but while fellow socialist Keir Hardie argued for the formation of a new political party, Burns remained aligned with the Liberal Party. In December 1905 Campbell-Bannerman included him in the cabinet as President of the Local Government Board, the second workingman (after Henry Broadhurst) to serve as a government minister. Burns remained proud of his working-class roots, declaring to the Commons in a speech in 1901: &quot;I am not ashamed to say that I am the son of a washerwoman&quot;. Whilst an MP he voted in favour of the 1908 Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Bill. He received praise for his administrative policy and was retained in the government after H. H. Asquith became Prime Minister in 1908. He was sworn into the Privy Council in 1905.

In 1914 Burns was appointed President of the Board of Trade, but on 2 August 1914, just two days before Britain declared war on Germany, signalling the start of the First World War, Burns resigned from the government in protest. He played no role in the war and left parliament in 1918.

Despite his earlier radicalism, Burns adopted various positions during his time in Cabinet that placed him on the right-wing of the Liberal Party. Although supportive of the government&#x27;s introduction of old-age pensions in 1908, Burns was opposed to the provision of government aid to the unemployed, arguing that no outdoor relief should be given to the poor. According to Kenneth D. Brown, Burns had long believed “that poverty and its related problems were the combined outcome of individual failure and an inadequate social environment. This was reinforced by a strong streak of puritanism which expressed itself in his opposition to smoking, drinking, and gambling.&quot; Burns had also spoken out in opposition to the gradual development of what would become known as the Welfare State, arguing in 1913 that charitable organisations and government “should not &quot;supersede the mother, and they should not by over-attention sterilise her initiative and capacity to do what every mother should be able to do for herself.&quot;

==Antisemitism==
Burns has been described as an antisemite by scholars of Jewish history such as David Feldman, Colin Holmes, Robert Wistrich and Anthony Julius.

His opposition to the Second Boer War was interconnected with his personal antisemitism, making repeated references to the &quot;trail of the financial serpent&quot;, declaring at an anti-war rally at Battersea Park in 1900 that “the South African Jew has…no bowels of compassion…every institution and class had been scheduled by the Jew as his heritage, medium and dependent. Where he could not intimidate, he corrupted; where he could not corrupt, he defamed…[the Boers] defend their land, not from a nation armed, vindicating a righteous cause, but against a militant capitalism that is using our soldiers as the uniformed brokers’ men turning out the wrong tenants in South Africa for the interests of the Jews...with wisdom foresight and kindliness, we may yet retain South Africa for the Empire and humanity, even though we may lose it for the Jews”.

Later, Burns declared in Parliament that &quot;wherever we examine, there is the financial Jew, operating, directing, inspiring the agencies that have led to this war&quot;. Wistrich has compared this conspiratorial antisemitism to that which spread during France during the time of the Dreyfus Affair.

Burns deplored the British Army which had, in his view, been transformed from the &quot;Sir Galahad of History&quot; into the &quot;janissary of the Jews&quot;. In 1902, Burns further denounced &quot;syndicated Jews who don&#x27;t fight but do know how to rob&quot;.

He remarked during a tour of the East End that &quot;the undoing of England is within the confines of our afternoon’s journey amongst the Jews&quot;. In 1900, David Lindsay recorded Burns telling him that he believed that the &quot;Jew is the tapeworm of civilisation&quot;.

==Interests==
Burns was a non-drinker and enthusiast for sporting activity. He was a long-time lover of cricket, being a regular at The Oval and Lord&#x27;s, and sustained severe injuries being hit in the face by a cricket ball while watching a match in 1894.

In 1919 he was left an annuity of £1000 by Andrew Carnegie which left him financially independent and he spent the rest of his life devoted to his interests in books, London history and cricket. As a book collector, he created a very large private library, much of which he left to University of London Library. He developed an acknowledged expertise in the history of London, and in 1929, when an American compared the River Thames unfavourably with the Mississippi, he responded &quot;The St Lawrence is water, the Mississippi is muddy water, but the Thames is liquid history&quot;.

A collection of his papers is held at the University of London library, and embraces many of his political interests, including universal adult suffrage, working hours and conditions, employment, pensions, poor laws, temperance, social conditions, local government, South African labour, and the Boer War.

He died aged 84 and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Cemetery, Battersea Rise. His connections with Battersea are recalled by the naming of a local school and a housing estate after him, as does John Burns Drive in Barking, and one of the Woolwich Ferry vessels also carried his name.

<doc id="436946" wikidata="Q7901811" url="?curid=436946" title="Usenet Death Penalty">
<text>On Usenet, the Usenet Death Penalty (UDP) is a final penalty that may be issued against Internet service providers or single users who produce too much spam or fail to adhere to Usenet standards. It is named after the death penalty (the state-sanctioned killing of a person as punishment for a crime), as it causes the banned user or provider to be unable to use Usenet, essentially &quot;killing&quot; their service. Messages that fall under the jurisdiction of a Usenet Death Penalty will be cancelled. Cancelled messages are deleted from Usenet servers and not allowed to propagate. This causes users on the affected ISP to be unable to post to Usenet, and it puts pressure on the ISP to change their policies. Notable cases include actions taken against UUNET, CompuServe, Excite@Home, and Google Groups.

== Types ==

There are three types of Usenet Death Penalty:
#&quot;Active&quot;: with an active UDP, messages that fall under the UDP will be automatically cancelled by third parties or their agents, such as by using cancelbots.
#&quot;Passive&quot;: with a passive UDP, messages that fall under the UDP will simply be ignored and will not spread.
#&quot;Partial&quot;: a partial UDP applies only to a certain subset of newsgroups, not the entire Usenet newsgroup hierarchy.

To be effective, the UDP must be supported by a large number of servers, or the majority of the major transit servers. Otherwise, the articles will propagate throughout the smaller, slower peerings.

UDPs are not casual acts. They are announced beforehand, only after the owner of the offending server has been contacted and given several chances to correct the perceived problem. Since the effects on the users of a server under a UDP can be significant, if the users want to post, the impact of a UDP can induce the operators of an offending server to address problems quickly.

UDPs have been issued against America Online, BBN Planet, CompuServe, Erols Internet, Netcom, TIAC, and UUNET.

== History ==

The first UDP software was written by Karl Kleinpaste in 1990, though there is disagreement when the term itself was coined: the Net Abuse FAQ claims 1993, but a message posted on 18 August of that year claims that it was coined &quot;years earlier&quot; by Eliot Lear.

A UDP was implemented against UUNET on 1 August 1997 after it became a host for many spammers and was unresponsive to abuse complaints. It forced the provider to implement antispam policies and tools and close their open relays. Executives called the UDP &quot;digital terrorism&quot;, threatened legal action, and asserted they had been planning to move against spammers anyway. As the volume of spam from UUNET decreased, the organizers called off the penalty on August 6, though their announcement was stifled by cancel messages from UDP opponents.

An active UDP was implemented against CompuServe on 18 November 1997, which was lifted the following day after the company implemented anti-spamming measures and instituted a new acceptable use policy addressing spamming.

A UDP scheduled to begin against Excite@Home on 19 January 2000 was lifted the day before it was scheduled to begin after the ISP began scanning for the misconfigured proxy servers on home users&#x27; computers which it blamed for spam originating from its network.

In October 2023, a UDP had been called upon Google Groups, with reasons citing persistent high-volume spam originated from the service and other operators&#x27; complaints about such spam that went unresolved. As a result, in December 2023, Google announced discontinuation of USENET service in Google Groups, which finally become effective on 15 February 2024.

<text>The House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the House of Lords, one of the chambers of Parliament. The Act was given royal assent on 11 November 1999. For centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats (hereditary peers); the Act removed such a right. However, as part of a compromise, the Act allowed ninety-two hereditary peers to remain in the House. Another ten were created life peers to enable them to remain in the House.

The Act decreased the membership of the House from 1,330 in October 1999 to 669 in March 2000. As another result of the Act, the majority of the Lords were now life peers, whose numbers had been gradually increasing since the Life Peerages Act 1958. As of June 2023, there were members of the House of Lords, of whom were senior Church of England bishops, whose representation in the House is governed by the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015.

==Background==
Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the more powerful of the two houses of Parliament. A series of developments, including such moments of crisis as the English Civil War, gradually shifted the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords and then to the House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to veto most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons have absolute power over money bills.

After eighteen years of Conservative government, the Labour Party led by Tony Blair won a landslide victory at the 1997 general election, inflicting the biggest defeat for the Conservatives since 1832. The Labour Party had for years endorsed abolition of the House of Lords in its election platforms, though since 1992 this had changed to a policy of reforming the House instead of such a drastic constitutional change.

During the 20th century, Liberal and Labour governments proposed many bills that were opposed by the House of Lords, which had been dominated by Conservatives since the 1890s, leading to some delay and, where proposed before elections, their dropping from the legislative agenda. In the first year of the Blair government, the Lords passed back Government bills 38 times. The rejection considered the most contentious was that of the European Elections Bill, against which the Lords voted five times. Blair stated that the Conservatives were using the hereditary peers to &quot;frustrate&quot; and &quot;overturn the will of the democratically elected House of Commons&quot;. Here Blair found an opportunity to implement one of Labour&#x27;s campaign promises, reforming the Lords.

On 24 November 1998, in opening the second session of Parliament, the Queen delivered her annual Speech from the Throne; the Speech was written for her by the government and outlines its legislative agenda for the forthcoming year. In it, she stated that her government would pursue a reform of the House of Lords. These remarks were followed by loud mumbles of &quot;Hear! Hear!&quot; from supportive Labour Members of Parliament, which led to similar utterances of &quot;Shame! Shame!&quot; from Conservative peers; such outbursts were unprecedented, for the Queen&#x27;s Speech is usually heard by a silent Parliament.

==Bill==
The House of Lords Bill was expected to face a tough fight in the House of Lords. Several Lords threatened to disrupt the Government&#x27;s other bills if they continued with the plan to abolish the hereditaries&#x27; right to sit in the House of Lords. Michael Onslow, 7th Earl of Onslow, for instance, said, &quot;I&#x27;m happy to force a division on each and every clause of the Scotland Bill. Each division takes 20 minutes and there are more than 270 clauses.&quot;

Stuart Randall, Baron Randall of St Budeaux put forward the idea of phasing out the hereditary peers by disqualifying their heirs.

Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington reminded the House that under the Salisbury Convention they could not block the bill.

In order to convince some peers to vote for reform, Tony Blair announced that he would compromise by allowing a number of hereditary peers to remain in the House of Lords on an interim basis. On 2 December 1998, the Conservative Leader of the Opposition, William Hague, rose in the House of Commons to attack Blair&#x27;s plans. He suggested that Blair&#x27;s changes indicated his lack of principles, claiming that Blair wanted to turn the House of Lords into a &quot;House of Cronies&quot;. Hague further suggested that the Conservative Party would never agree to such constitutional reforms that were &quot;based on no comprehensive plan or principle.&quot; Hague&#x27;s remarks backfired when Blair revealed that the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, rather than oppose his reforms, would definitely support them, and that he had done a secret deal with the Conservative leader in the House of Lords, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne. Hague immediately removed Cranborne from office, but, in protest, several Conservative Lords who held front-bench positions resigned.

On 19 January 1999, the Leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, introduced the House of Lords Bill into the House of Commons. The House of Commons passed the bill by a vote of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to the House of Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called &quot;Weatherill Amendment&quot;, named after Bernard Weatherill, Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House of Lords.

Several controversies relating to the technicalities of the bill were brought up in the House of Lords. One issue regarded the language used in clauses 1 to 7, which was described by Patrick Mayhew, Lord Mayhew of Twysden as &quot;uncertain in its effects and would leave the position of most hereditary Peers uncertain if the Bill was enacted.&quot; A second issue was related to the Acts of Union 1707 uniting Scotland and England into the Kingdom of Great Britain. After lengthy debates, both matters were referred to the House of Lords Committee on Privileges.

Under the Acts of Union 1707, Scottish Lords would be entitled to elect 16 Scottish representative peers to sit on their Lordships&#x27; behalf in the House of Lords. In 1963, the Peerage Act 1963 was passed, allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House, not just 16 of them. It was felt that removing all Scottish representation would breach the Articles. The Government, however, responded that the Articles did envisage a change in the election of representative peers. It was argued that some portions of the Treaty were entrenched, while others were not. For instance, Scotland and England were united &quot;forever,&quot; the Scottish Court of Session was to &quot;remain in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted,&quot; and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was &quot;effectually and unalterably secured.&quot; However, it was suggested, the election of Scottish representative peers was not entrenched, and therefore could be amended. Furthermore, the Government argued that Parliament was entirely sovereign and supreme, and could at its will change the Articles of Union. For example, the Treaty of Union joining Great Britain and Ireland required that the two nations be united &quot;forever&quot;. Nonetheless, in 1922, by an Act of parliament, most of Ireland was made independent as the Irish Free State. Thus, even entrenched clauses were argued to be open to amendment by the authority of Parliament. The Committee agreed and reported to the House on 20 October 1999 that the Bill was indeed lawful in this regard.

After the Committee&#x27;s first and second reports were considered, the Lords passed the bill 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999. During the session, Charles Beauclerk, Earl of Burford, son of the Duke of St Albans, launched a protest at the constitutional implications of the bill while standing on the Woolsack, and was ejected from the chamber. Once the Lords settled the differences between their version of the bill and the Commons version, the Bill received royal assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of Parliament. The Act came into force the same day.

==Membership of the House of Lords==
The House of Lords Act 1999 first provides that &quot;No-one shall be a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage.&quot; (The Act treats the Principality of Wales and the Earldom of Chester as hereditary peerages.) The Act then provides that 92 peers, including the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain and 90 other peers elected in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House, would be excepted from the exclusion of hereditary peers, and that after the first session of the next Parliament, whenever one of those seats fell vacant, the Lords would have to proceed to a by-election. The Act also provided that a hereditary peer would be entitled to vote in elections for, and sit in, the House of Commons, unless he or she was a member of the House of Lords. Previously, hereditary peers had been constitutionally disqualified from participating in elections to the House of Commons. The first hereditary peer to gain a seat in the Commons under this provision was John Thurso.
The Act prevents even hereditary peers who are the first to hold their titles from sitting automatically in the House of Lords; however, the Government gave life peerages (the titles of which are indicated in parentheses) to all three living non-royal hereditary peers of first creation (Low, Erroll and Pakenham were the only living non-royal hereditary peers of first creation as of November 1999; see the lists of hereditary peerages) and also offered life peerages to the royal peers (of whom only the Earl of Snowdon accepted):

William Whitelaw, died on 1 July 1999; had he lived he would have been eligible as a former Leader of the House of Lords 1983–1988 and as a first holder of his hereditary peerage.

Additionally, life peerages were created for all former living Leaders of the House of Lords who were hereditary peers (Quintin Hogg already held a life peerage since 1970): 
The following hereditary peers who had been created life peers remained in the House after the Act was passed, they were:

Life peerages were also offered to members of the royal family with new hereditary peerages, but were declined, as this would have meant they would continue to hold seats in the reformed House of Lords: Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Charles, Prince of Wales; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.

===First election to the House of Lords===

Before the granting of Royal Assent, the Lords had adopted a Standing Order making provision for the election of those hereditary peers who would remain members of the House under section 2 of the Act. The Order provided that there be elected:
* two peers by the Labour hereditary peers
* three peers by the Liberal Democrat hereditary peers
* 28 peers by the Crossbench hereditary peers
* 42 peers by the Conservative hereditary peers
* 15 peers, ready to serve as Deputy Speakers and in other offices, by the whole House of Lords

The elections for officers of the House were held on 27 and 28 October 1999, while those for peers elected by party were held on 3 and 4 November; the results were proclaimed to the House on 29 October and 5 November. Voters were required to rank candidates in order of preference for the number of seats available, with the candidates receiving the greatest number of votes, without regard to the ranking on the ballots, so in effect block voting, declared elected. Only if there were ties would the ranking be examined. Thereafter, until November 2002, if a vacancy occurred, the next-highest placed unsuccessful candidate in the original election would fill the seat. Following the deaths of the Earl of Carnarvon in 2000 and Baroness Wharton in 2001, Lord Cobbold and Lord Chorley became eligible to take their respective seats in the House.

===Subsequent by-elections===
Since November 2002, by-elections have been held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016, two in 2017, three in 2018, two in 2019, five in 2021, six in 2022, and three in 2023. Voting is by preferential voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference. As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. To win the election, a peer must receive at least one half of the available votes. If no candidate receives this number of first preference votes, the candidate with the fewest first preference votes is eliminated, with each of their votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot (see instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives at least one half of the remaining votes.

== Subsequent reform proposals ==
=== Labour proposals to remove remaining hereditary peers (until 2009) ===
The Labour Government expected eventually to present a bill for a second stage of House of Lords reform based on Lord Steel&#x27;s earlier bills, which aimed to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers; the history of such attempts between 1997 and 2009 is set out in a report in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Proposals called &quot;The House of Lords: Reform&quot; were published by order of the House on 1 January 2007, with a foreword by Jack Straw. In 2009, Labour introduced the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which would have ended the by-elections to fill vacancies for hereditary peers, thereby removing them through attrition. However, these elements were dropped from the bill entirely, along with other clauses relating to the expulsion and resignation of peers from the House of Lords.

=== 2012 coalition bill electing all Lords and halving their number ===

The coalition government of David Cameron (Conservatives) and Nick Clegg (Liberal Democrats), inaugurated in 2010, had plans to reform the House of Lords by making it mostly elected and slashing its size. Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg spearheaded the push to bring in the changes. The government wanted four-fifths of members of a reformed House of Lords to be elected. They would have served 15-year terms of office, after which they could not run for re-election. The number of peers was to be almost halved, from 826 to 450. The chamber would have kept the title of House of Lords, after names like Senate and Reformed House were rejected. Peers were each to represent a specific region of the United Kingdom, as constituted for the election of Members of the European Parliament. One-third of seats would have been filled by elections held every five years. Of the remaining 90 members, 12—rather than the current 26—would have been Church of England bishops. The remainder were to continue to be appointed, and all hereditary peers were to be removed. The government had scheduled passage of its bill for the spring of 2013, and the elections were to have taken place in 2015, but the effort stalled when in July 2012, 91 Conservatives in the Commons rebelled against the government in a vote on how to timetable the House of Lords Reform Bill. In August 2012, the coalition&#x27;s plans were dropped.

=== 2014 and 2015 reform acts ===
The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 allowed peers to retire or resign, to be expelled for serious criminal offences, or to be removed for non-attendance during a whole session. The Act came out of a concern with the size of the chamber; a year later, in May 2015 membership stood at 787 with an additional 31 on a leave of absence. It was presented by Dan Byles and based on earlier bills which Lord Steel had attempted to pass through parliament. The House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015 authorised the House of Lords to expel or suspend a member for serious misconduct; expelled members are permanently barred from returning to the House. Unlike the 2014 Act, members did not have to have been sentenced to at least a year&#x27;s imprisonment in order to be expelled for misconduct. The Act was introduced by Baroness Hayman to address the &quot;narrow&quot; circumstances for expulsion set out in the 2014 Act.

=== 2016 bill to phase out hereditary peers ===
An amendment to the 1999 Act was proposed by Labour peer Lord Grocott to abolish by-elections, but was filibustered in 2016 by Conservative hereditary peer Lord Trefgarne.

<doc id="436955" wikidata="Q793074" url="?curid=436955" title="Benny &amp; Joon">
<text>Benny &amp; Joon is a 1993 American romantic comedy-drama film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer about how two eccentric individuals, Sam (Johnny Depp) and Juniper (&quot;Joon&quot;) (Mary Stuart Masterson), find each other and fall in love. Aidan Quinn also stars, and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.

The film features Depp&#x27;s physical comedy routines (which are based on silent film comics Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd). In the United States, it popularized the song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; by The Proclaimers. &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; was shot primarily on location in Spokane, Washington, while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near Metaline Falls, Washington.

==Plot==
Benjamin &quot;Benny&quot; Pearl and his mentally ill sister Juniper (&quot;Joon&quot;) live together following the deaths of their parents. Joon joins a poker game at a friend&#x27;s house and loses a bet that commits Sam, the eccentric cousin of Benny&#x27;s buddy Mike, to live with the Pearls. Benny is initially angry, but then decides Sam should stay.

Joon aids Sam (who is illiterate) when he struggles with writing to his mother, and the two go to the diner where Ruthie is working. She takes them on an errand, then takes them home. After Ruthie stays for dinner, her car won&#x27;t start, and Benny drives her home, where they set a dinner date. Meanwhile, left alone, Joon and Sam kiss. Benny and Ruthie have a fun date, but Benny abruptly ends it because he wants to get home to Joon. Sam goes to a video store to apply for a job there. Benny, Joon, and Sam go to a park, where Sam starts doing tricks with his hat, attracting an appreciative crowd. Benny stays at the park to reflect and sends Joon home with Sam, where they make love. Sam then tells Joon he loves her, which Joon reciprocates.

When Benny makes suggestions to Sam about his comedy routines, Joon becomes agitated and makes Sam explain that he and Joon are romantically involved. Benny throws Sam out, yells at Joon, and shows her a pamphlet about a group home that would be a better home for her. Joon starts hitting Benny and screaming, and he pushes her away. Feeling bad, Benny leaves to get her some pudding. While Benny is away, Sam arrives. They pack suitcases and get on a bus, but Joon begins to hear voices in her head and argues with them. The bus is stopped, and two paramedics restrain Joon. When Benny arrives at thle hospital, the doctor tells him Joon does not want to see him. After telling Benny off, Sam goes to stay with Ruthie. Meanwhile, Benny feels guilty about his treatment of Joon.

Benny finds Sam, now working at the video store, and asks for his help. They go to the hospital. Benny apologizes to Joon, persuades her to consider getting her own apartment, and tells her that Sam has come back for her. Joon tells the doctor that she would like to try living in her own apartment. The siblings reconcile, and Sam and Joon are reunited. Later, Benny brings roses to Ruthie. He takes another bouquet to Joon&#x27;s apartment but leaves the flowers in the doorway when he sees Sam and Joon making grilled cheese sandwiches with a clothing iron.

==Cast==

* Johnny Depp as Sam
* Mary Stuart Masterson as Juniper &quot;Joon&quot; Pearl
* Aidan Quinn as Benjamin &quot;Benny&quot; Pearl
* Julianne Moore as Ruthie
* Oliver Platt as Eric
* C.C.H. Pounder as Dr. Garvey
* Dan Hedaya as Thomas
* Joe Grifasi as Mike
* William H. Macy as Randy Burch
* Eileen Ryan as Mrs. Smail
* Liane Curtis as Claudia
* Lynette Walden as Female Customer

==Production==
Woody Harrelson was originally cast to play the role of Benny, while Laura Dern was considered for the role of Joon. Dern passed on the role, and Harrelson quit to take a role in &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;. Aidan Quinn was brought in at the last minute to replace Harrelson. A lawsuit later ensued with Winona Ryder, who was dating Johnny Depp at the time and was slated to play Joon after Dern quit. Depp and Ryder broke up, leaving the role of Joon open, which was given to Masterson just days before production began.

==Release==
===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;The story wants to be about love, but is also about madness, and somehow it weaves the two together with a charm that would probably not be quite so easy in real life.&quot; Owen Gleiberman gave the film a grade of &quot;B&quot;, saying &quot;the movie is full of absurdist we&#x27;re meant to find magically funny; mostly they&#x27;re just cute (Sam cooking up grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron, a poker game in which a snorkel mask and baseball tickets are used as stakes). Beneath the domesticated surrealism, though, &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; becomes genuinely touching–a love story about separation anxiety. Benny, the saintly grease monkey, thinks he has to devote his life to Joon in order to keep her out of an institution. Can he give her the space she needs to fall in love (and then take said space for himself)? You already know the answer, but Quinn and Mastersonnow gentle, now snipinglet it play out with tender conviction.&quot; Janet Maslin wrote:

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; holds an approval rating of 76% based on 41 reviews, with an average score of 5.80/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Box office===
In spite of its &quot;commercially improbable story&quot;, the film became a sleeper hit, evidence of the resurgence of date movies &quot;after a decade dominated by action film and horror films.&quot; In the first two weeks of a limited release, &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; grossed $8 million. Its domestic box office total reached over $23.2 million. It grossed $7 million internationally for a worldwide total of $30 million.

==Portrayal of schizophrenia==
Roger Ebert writes that Joon is &quot;schizophrenic, although the screenplay doesn&#x27;t ever say the word out loud.&quot;
David J. Robinson remarks, &quot;More convincing features of schizophrenia (undifferentiated type) soon follow. We are told that Joon experiences auditory hallucinations, does well with a stable routine, and takes medication on a daily basis. Her use of language is one of her most interesting attributes. She uses the last housekeeper&#x27;s surname (&quot;Smail&quot;) to refer to anyone who might fill the position, which is how Sam (Johnny Depp) enters her life.&quot; E. Fuller Torrey calls the film &quot;a beautifully filmed, but unrealistic story about a brother who is the sole caretaker of his kid sister, who has schizophrenia. ... While the film addresses such issues as noncompliance with medication and disputes over independent living arrangements, the bad times are never too severe or long-lasting. Reviewers Mick Martin and Marsha Porter remarked &quot;[Although] most viewers will enjoy this bittersweet comedy ... Folks coping with mental illness in real life will be offended by yet another film in which the problem is sanitized and trivialized&quot;.

==Musical adaptation==
A stage musical adaptation of the movie premiered at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California, from September 2 to October 22, 2017. The musical features music by Nolan Gasser, lyrics by Mindi Dickstein, book by Kirsten Guenther, choreography by Scott Rink and direction by Jack Cummings III. The show ran at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, from April 4 to May 5, 2019. The Paper Mill production featured Claybourne Elder as Benny, Hannah Elless as Joon and Bryce Pinkham as Sam.

<doc id="436966" wikidata="Q268900" url="?curid=436966" title="Simon Barere">
<text>Simon Barere (; – 2 April 1951) was a Russian pianist. His surname Барер is transliterated &quot;Barer&quot;, but as an adult he adopted the spelling &quot;Barere&quot; in order to reduce the frequency of mispronunciation.

==Biography==
Barere was born in Odessa (then Russian Empire, now part of Ukraine) as the eleventh of thirteen children in a Jewish family. He studied at the St. Petersburg Conservatory under Anna Yesipova and then Felix Blumenfeld. Pianist Vladimir Horowitz was also a pupil of Blumenfeld, although Barere was Blumenfeld&#x27;s preferred student. After graduation, he played concerts throughout the region and taught at the Kiev Conservatory. He emigrated to Berlin, then to Sweden, and finally to the United States. During the autumn of 1935, he toured the UK under the management of Harold Holt, making a number of appearances as supporting artist to Richard Tauber. 

Barere was especially known for his speed and finger dexterity; his rendition of Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey&quot; and many other recordings were acclaimed. According to music critic Harold C. Schonberg, Barere produced a colourful piano tone and could also be highly musical.

Barere gave annual recitals at Carnegie Hall which were often recorded by his son, Boris. Among the performances recorded live in 1947 at Carnegie Hall was Liszt&#x27;s Sonata in B minor, which was released on Remington Records in the 1950s. Other Barere performances include Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Reminiscences de Don Juan&quot; and &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 12&quot;, Blumenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Étude for the Left Hand Alone&quot;, and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2.

On 2 April 1951, Barere suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during a performance of Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto at Carnegie Hall, with Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. He collapsed and died backstage shortly thereafter.

==Recordings==

In 1985, his complete HMV recordings, made at Abbey Road Studios between 1934 and 1936, were remastered by Bryan Crimp and issued by APR. Additional recordings have been issued on CD. Barere made a series of recordings for Remington in March 1951, showing the pianist in fine form before his sudden death the following month.

There is also an astonishing home recording of Barere playing excerpts from his repertoire, in 1949.

<text>Golf billiards (also referred to as simply golf in clear context, and sometimes called golf pool or golf pocket billiards) is a pocket billiards game usually played for money. Unlike the majority of such games, it allows more than two people to play without compromises or rule changes. The game borrows from the outdoor game of golf, which is historically related to the cue sports. It is usually played on 10-foot or 12-foot snooker tables as their size and structure are more appropriate. In 2006 the Billiard Congress of America commented it was more popular than snooker in the United States.

==Rules==
The players each receive a numbered . Using some method such as , an order is established, and the players always shoot in that order.

The pockets are assigned numbers, clockwise starting at the top right corner pocket as viewed from the top (head) of the table, as the 1 hole (or 1 pocket) through 6 hole. The object for each player is to () their own object ball in the 1 hole, 2 hole, 3 hole, etc., in ascending order.

The first player places their numbered ball on the . The player may then place the in as in snooker, or on a &quot;D&quot;-less American-style table, in (i.e., behind the ).

The player attempts to pocket his ball in the 1 hole. If they succeed, the object ball is again and they proceed, playing with the cue ball as it lies, to the next hole, otherwise it is the next shooter&#x27;s turn, who also shoots the cue ball from the &quot;D&quot; or kitchen at their numbered ball on the foot spot, aiming for the 1 hole. An object ball not pocketed is left on the table.

Once all players have taken their first shot, players shoot with the cue ball wherever it lies after the previous shot. Note that it is possible for the first player to win the game without any other player getting to shoot. It is possible to run the 1,2,3,4,5,6 holes but highly unlikely on a snooker table as compared to a pool table, due to the rounded, thus narrower pockets.

If the player before the incoming shooter committed a , and the new shooter is (does not have a clear shot to his ball), the ball(s) in the way may be temporarily moved (gets A lift) so that the shooter has a clear shot. These must be put back after the shot. This rule is highly unusual, perhaps even unique, in the world of cue sports, and often unused even in golf. (this only occurs if the shooter did not hit his ball first, not necessarily on a cue ball foul)

The game is won when one player legally pockets his ball into the 6 hole.

In some more advanced versions of golf, wooden pegs (AKA skittles) are placed on all spots except for the Black spot, and floating red snooker balls are placed in the middle of each cushion. Knocking over a pin results in a pre-defined number of &quot;penalty strokes&quot; added to the offender&#x27;s score, and they must then also restart the current hole. The red balls are not penalties in themselves. But as they get hit by player&#x27;s object or cue balls as the game progresses, the red balls end up &quot;floating&quot; about the table, creating roaming obstacles and making the game much more difficult, particularly when a larger number of players (i.e. 4-8) are involved.

===Scoring===
Players are assigned a certain predetermined value for each foul committed. These are known as &quot;hickeys&quot;. Players owe each player the difference between their hickey count and that player&#x27;s count. The game is also usually assigned a base value which is given to the winner by the losing players.

===Fouls===
The following constitute ():
* Causing any ball to leave the table. If it is the cue ball, it is spotted by the next shooter on the D. Any other ball is spotted as close as possible to the foot spot.
* Pocketing a ball in the wrong hole.
* Failing to hit the shooter&#x27;s ball first or at all.
* Failing to do one of the following:
:# Legally pocket the player&#x27;s object ball
:# Contact a with any ball after a legal hit
:# the cue ball off a cushion to a legal hit.

This last rule is very different from that in most pocket billiards games, in which a legal kick shot still requires that &quot;after&quot; the cue ball hits the object ball, a ball must contact a cushion or be pocketed.

==&quot;Around-the-world&quot; variant==
In New Hampshire, a local variant that has been subject to organized tournament play since 1947 in the Queen City Pool League, is called &quot;around-the-world&quot; or &quot;roundy&quot; for short. It differs from standard golf pool in several ways:
*The pockets, beginning with the same pocket as the standard game, are numbered counter-clockwise, and the table is a standard 4.5 foot by 9 foot pool table, not a snooker table, and ball-in-hand shots are taken from behind the head string, as there is no &quot;D&quot;.
*All players use the same target object ball (the 1 ball).
*All of the object balls are racked in a triangle with the apex ball on the , and the game opened with a hard break (as in eight-ball); the 1 ball is played from where it lies after the break (unless pocketed on the break, in which case it is spotted back on the foot spot just as if it had been legally pocketed.)
*Scoring is simpler: 0 to 6 points, for the number of 1 ball shots successfully made, and there are no &quot;hickeys&quot;; whoever reaches 6 points first wins that . A consists of five games.
*Failure to contact a cushion with a ball is not a foul (as a consequence, particularly challenging can be set up).
*One may shoot at any ball, and use other balls to pocket the 1 ball; there is no requirement that the 1 ball be hit first or even at all.
*One may shoot at and pocket any ball other than the 1 ball into any (for no point award), and continue play; this is usually done to gain a better position on the 1 ball to pocket it in the necessary pocket. Balls pocketed in this manner are not returned to the table during the game. Pocketing the 1 ball into the wrong pocket remains a foul.
*If a shot fails to contact any object ball at all, the opponent may optionally require (in lieu of taking the turn) that the original shooter to re-shoot the shot from the original cue ball position (a subsequent failure ends the original shooter&#x27;s turn, spots the 1 ball and gives the incoming player ball-in-hand behind the headstring) (Compare the in nine-ball.)
*Jump shots were banned in the tournament rules as of 1996 due to equipment damage concerns.

<text>The flag of Asturias shows the &quot;Cruz de la Victoria&quot; (Victory Cross) in yellow (PMS 109) over blue (PMS 829).

==Design==
According to the tradition, the Victory Cross was carried by Pelagius, first King of Asturias, in the decisive Battle of Covadonga against the Moors in 722. This battle, fought in the mountains of Asturias, was hailed by 19th and 20th century historiography as the start of the Reconquista, the Christian re-conquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Moorish domination. However, there is no historical evidence about the use of this cross.

In 908 the Asturian King Alfonso III the Great ordered that the original wooden cross, made of oak, be clad in gold and precious stones. Currently, it is kept in the Holy Chamber of the Oviedo Cathedral.

The Greek letters Alpha and Omega hang from its horizontal axis. This is a direct reference to the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13), &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.&quot;

=== Color specifications ===
==History==
The banners that might represent the early medieval Kingdom of Asturias are unknown, although a white ensign with a red border and a cross of the same color has been attributed as the royal flag of Ramiro I, as can be seen in tomb A of the Cathedral in Santiago of Compostela. Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, an Asturian intellectual of the Enlightenment, led a note with his findings on the symbols of the Kingdom of Asturias, based on the older description of Lazaro Diaz del Valle an author of 17th Century. According to this instruction, the Victory Cross was gold on a scarlet background, i.e. the early colors of the church.

The origin of the flag of Asturias is in 1808, during the Peninsular War. As there was not any Spanish official flag yet, Asturians created the current flag, without any separatist intention in the war against the Napoleon&#x27;s empire. In its first version, it included the motto &quot;Asturias jamás vencida&quot; (Asturias never defeated).

==Variant &quot;Asturina&quot;== 

The flag of Asturias with red star, also called plain Asturina, is a version of the flag of Asturias with a five-pointed red star on top of the pole and a cross in the middle, without the letters alpha and omega. This flag is associated with pro-independence, socialist and communists groups in Asturias. This variant comes from the cultural collective Conceyu Bable who developed it in the mid-1970s. Other Spanish regions also have variants of their flags with red stars, for example, in Galicia there is Estreleira.

<doc id="436988" wikidata="Q751965" url="?curid=436988" title="Fraser's dolphin">
<text>Fraser&#x27;s dolphin or the Sarawak dolphin (Lagenodelphis hosei) is a cetacean in the family Delphinidae found in deep waters in the Pacific Ocean and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Lagenodelphis hosei&quot; is species of the delphinid family, distinguished from other dolphins as a monotypic genus, Lagenodelphis.

In 1895, Charles E. Hose found a skull on a beach in Sarawak, Borneo. He donated it to the British Museum. The skull remained unstudied until 1956 when Francis Fraser examined it and concluded that it was similar to species in both the genera &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Delphinus&quot; but not the same as either. A new genus was created by simply merging these two names together. The specific name is given in Hose&#x27;s honour.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1971 that the whole body of a Fraser&#x27;s dolphin, as it was by then becoming known, was discovered. At that time washed-up specimens were found on Cocos Island in the eastern Pacific, in South Australia and in South Africa.

== Description ==
Fraser&#x27;s dolphins are about long and weight at birth, growing to and by adulthood. They have a stocky build, a small fin in relation to the size of the body, as well as conspicuously small flippers. 

The dorsal fin and beak are also shorter than other species of dolphin. The upper side is a gray-blue to gray-brown. A dirty cream-colored line runs along the flanks from the beak, above the eye, to the anus. There is a dark stripe under this line. The belly and throat are usually white, sometimes tinged pink. The lack of a prominent beak is a distinguishing characteristic of this dolphin. From a distance, however, it may be confused with the striped dolphin, which has a similar coloration and is found in the same regions.

Fraser&#x27;s dolphins swim quickly in large, tightly-packed groups, numbering anywhere from 100 to 1,000 in number. Often porpoising, the groups chop up the water tremendously. The sight of seeing a large group fleeing from a fishing vessel has been reported as &quot;very dramatic&quot;.

It is also unique in having the smallest genitalia of any open sea dolphin.

The species feeds on pelagic fish, squid and shrimp found some distance below the surface of the water ( to ). Virtually no sunlight penetrates this depth, so feeding is carried out using echolocation alone.

== Population and distribution ==
Though only accounted for relatively recently, the number of reported sightings has become substantial — indicating that the species may not be as rare as thought as recently as the 1980s. However the species is still not nearly as well understood as its more coastal cousins. No global population estimates exist.

The dolphin is normally sighted in deep tropical waters; between 30°S and 20°N. The Eastern Pacific is the most reliable site for viewings. Groups of stranded dolphins have been found as far afield as France and Uruguay. However these are regarded as anomalous and possibly due to unusual oceanographic conditions, such as El Niño.

The species is also relatively common in the Gulf of Mexico but less so in the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.

The Philippines is particularly known area for dolphin sightings, and is home to one of the larger populations of the Fraser&#x27;s dolphin in the world.

== Conservation ==
The Southeast Asian populations of Fraser&#x27;s dolphins are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

In addition, Fraser&#x27;s dolphin is covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU).

<text>Leslie Edward Pridgen (born August 6, 1978), better known by his stage name Freeway, is an American rapper. Originally hailing from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he first gained recognition after appearing on Jay-Z&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot; in 2000. The following year, he became a member of the Philadelphia-based hip hop collective State Property, which were signed to Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc-A-Fella Records, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings. After releasing their debut album, Pridgen signed to Roc-A-Fella as a solo artist and began work on his debut album, &quot;Philadelphia Freeway&quot; (2003). Upon release, the album peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and saw positive critical response. He released a follow-up, &quot;Free at Last&quot; (2007) to moderate reception before him and fellow State Property cohorts were dropped from the label. 

In 2009, Pridgen was briefly signed to Cash Money Records, although his next three albums: &quot;Philadelphia Freeway 2&quot; (2009), &quot;Diamond in the Ruff&quot; (2012), and &quot;Free Will&quot; (2016) were released independently. He returned to work with Jay-Z in 2018, signing to his successor label Roc Nation to release his sixth album, &quot;Think Free&quot; in June of that year.

==Life and career==

===Early life and career beginnings===
Freeway was born Leslie Pridgen on August 6, 1978, in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He adopted his moniker from the name of the infamous drug trafficker &quot;Freeway&quot; Rick Ross as he found no one wanted to listen to a rapper named Leslie. Freeway began his career by participating in freestyle battles in his high school and met fellow Philadelphia native Beanie Sigel, while rapping on stage at a hometown nightclub. Not long after being signed to Roc-A-Fella Records, Sigel put in a word for Freeway, who made his first appearance on &quot;The Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot;, on the track &quot;1-900-Hustler&quot; with Sigel, Jay-Z, and Memphis Bleek. After the appearance, Jay-Z signed him to a deal; he was featured on &quot;Think it&#x27;s a Game&quot;, also alongside Jay-Z, on Sigel&#x27;s second album &quot;The Reason&quot;. In 2001, he underwent a notorious freestyle battle with then-unsigned rapper Cassidy, hosted by Swizz Beatz and lost with a unanimous judges decision.

===&quot;Philadelphia Freeway&quot; (2003)===
On February 25, 2003, Freeway released his debut album, &quot;Philadelphia Freeway&quot;. The album was produced primarily by Roc-A-Fella-affiliated beatsmiths Just Blaze, Bink!, and Kanye West and featured a large number of Roc-A-Fella rappers. Many of them also hailed from Philadelphia, and were soon compiled into the group State Property led by Freeway and Beanie Sigel. The album had two singles, the biggest hits of Freeway&#x27;s career thus far: &quot;What We Do&quot;, featuring Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel, for which a video was released showcasing most of the Roc&#x27;s roster at the time, and &quot;Flipside&quot;, featuring State Property member Peedi Crakk; both records were produced by Just Blaze. The album also sold over 500,000 units in the United States.

===State Property problems and Ice City (2004–2006)===
After Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;retirement&quot; album and the uncertainty over what direction the label was headed, Beanie Sigel was convicted and jailed on a charge of attempted murder. Relations between Beanie Sigel and State Property soured after the incarceration of Sigel, and State Property essentially broke up, with Sigel stating he was unsure he would work with them again. Over the next few years, members of the group—most notably Freeway and Sigel themselves—slowly began collaborating once again, though members such as Oschino and Peedi Crakk fell out of the loop. During this time, with his crew and label in turmoil, Freeway turned to his Muslim faith. With uncertainty in the air, Freeway put together another Philadelphia-based crew called Ice City, named after their North Philly neighborhood. While active, the group consisted of Face Money, Bars and Hydro, with Freeway playing a major mentoring role. Their debut album, &quot;Welcome to the Hood&quot;, was released under Sure Shot Recordings, but received little attention. Subsequently, groupmember Hydro released a mixtape dissing Freeway, distancing himself and the group from its founder.

===&quot;Free At Last&quot; and departure from Roc-A-Fella (2007–2009)===
 In response to a crisis of faith, Freeway went on hiatus for a few years, making his Hajj, a journey to the holy city of Mecca, required by every Muslim at least once in his or her lifetime if they are able. Upon his return, Freeway recorded his second album &quot;Free at Last&quot;, which was released in the United States on November 20, 2007. Initially, Jay-Z and 50 Cent were both set to co-executive produce the album; while both were featured, the project ended up solely a Roc-A-Fella release, with 50 giving up his co-executive producer&#x27;s role. The first single was &quot;Roc-A-Fella Billionaires&quot;, featuring Jay-Z, which leaked to the internet; the second single, and first official single, was &quot;Lights Get Low&quot; featuring Rick Ross and Dre of the production team Cool &amp; Dre. As the album featured no production from either Kanye West or Just Blaze, who together produced the lion&#x27;s share of his debut, Freeway lashed out at them in his lyrics, generating rumors that he and his former producers had unresolved differences. After the album&#x27;s release, Freeway went on record to clarify his comments, saying he had no real animosity towards them and that he had only been speaking his mind. The album eventually sold over 100,000. In 2008, Freeway initiated what he called the Month of Madness, releasing a song a day for the month of December. The songs, featuring input from Phoe Notes, Erick Sermon, Don Cannon, Cardiak, Jake One, Oddisee and others, were later compiled into a mixtape. The year 2009 brought an announcement that he would be working on his third album amidst his regrets over hearing Jay-Z had stepped down as &quot;Def Jam&quot; president. Shortly afterward, the rapper announced his release from Def Jam, which distributed a now defunct Roc-A-Fella Records, and that his next album would be titled &quot;The Stimulus Package&quot;, produced by Jake One and released by Rhymesayers Entertainment.

===&quot;Philadelphia Freeway 2&quot; and record deals (2009)===
A project titled &quot;Philadelphia Freeway 2&quot; was released on the independent label Real Talk Entertainment on May 19, 2009. The first single, &quot;Finally Free&quot;, was released on iTunes on April 14, 2009. Freeway also made an original song &quot;Car Jack&quot; for the 2009 game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned&quot;. On March 19, 2009, he performed at SXSW. Freeway released his mixtape &quot;The Beat Made Me Do It&quot; on November 13, 2009, which featured production by veteran producer Jake One with assistance by Don Cannon to officially announce his 2010 Rhymesayers debut album &quot;The Stimulus Package&quot;. Rhymesayers and Freeway leaked the first official track and video, &quot;Know What I Mean&quot; off of &quot;The Stimulus Package&quot; on December 1, 2009.

In June 2009, Freeway had confirmed a deal with Cash Money Records, and the start of his own label, Free Money. Following this, he put out a few mixtape tracks speaking of the deal, including &quot;Touchdown&quot; and &quot;All Night Long&quot;. 

Freeway, speaking on that label deal and his relationship with Jay-Z:

&quot;I been fucking with Cash Money,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;You know, me and Wayne did a joint for the last album, but we couldn&#x27;t get the shit cleared in time and all that. We just throwing around some ideas. And I&#x27;m launching a label, Free Money, so what better home for it...My man Ceelo, he worked with Baby, so he really basically connected us like that. But, right now everything is still in preliminary...It&#x27;s still Roc-A-Fella for life. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not going to leave me...Everything still preliminary. Jay give me his blessing with whatever I want to do. Jay want to see niggas making moves.&quot;

===&quot;Diamond In the Ruff&quot; (2010–2014)===
In a video interview with KarmaloopTV in 2010, Freeway announced a new clothing line in the works titled &quot;Freestyle&quot;. In addition to the new clothing line, Free also announced an album called &quot;Diamond In The Ruff&quot; which featured production from Jake One, Bink!, Needlz and Just Blaze. Freeway explained in the interview that the album should have come after &quot;Philadelphia Freeway&quot;. &quot;Diamond In the Ruff&quot; was released November 27, 2012, and featured collaborations with Rick Ross and Black Thought. Freeway recorded an EP with Statik Selektah, called the &quot;Statik-Free&quot; EP, which was completed in 24 hours and released on iTunes on January 11, 2011.

Freeway also released a collaboration in 2014 with DJ mashup artist Girl Talk, an EP called &quot;Broken Ankles&quot;, which included stylistic attributes that would normally be included in transitions between Girl Talk segments.

===&quot;Free Will&quot; and health scare (2015–2017)===
In 2015, Freeway was diagnosed with kidney failure, and as a result, wrote about dealing with the experience on his 2016 album, &quot;Free Will&quot;, which he released independently. He began what became a three-year wait for a kidney transplant, and currently serves as the official ambassador for the Kidney Foundation. On &quot;Free Will,&quot; frequent Nas collaborator L.E.S. produced &quot;Kane &amp; Abel,&quot; and Girl Talk produced &quot;Addiction,&quot; &quot;Always Love You&quot; and &quot;First Things First.&quot; G-Unit&#x27;s Young Buck has a feature spot on &quot;We Thuggin.&quot;

===&quot;Think Free&quot; and the return to the Roc (2018–2019)===
After years away, Freeway returned to working with Jay-Z at his entertainment company called Roc Nation in 2018. Under this umbrella, Freeway&#x27;s sixth solo album, &quot;Think Free&quot;, was released that year on June 22, and its 13 songs include appearances from Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert, Jadakiss, BJ The Chicago Kid, Fat Joe, Faith Evans and more. The first singles released were &quot;All Falls Down,&quot; &quot;All the Way Live&quot; and &quot;Blood Pressure,&quot; with the latter featuring Lil Wayne.

Prior to the release of &quot;Think Free,&quot; Freeway announced he was filming the &quot;Think Free&quot; documentary, a video account offering a behind-the-scene look at his music, family life, and health following the diagnosis of kidney failure. The documentary, which was originally scheduled to accompany the &quot;Think Free&quot; album, has yet to be released. The rapper underwent a kidney transplant in February 2019.

<text>Ropework or marlinespike seamanship are umbrella terms for a skillset spanning the use, maintenance, and repair of rope. Ropework is used by seafarers, climbers and military personnel.

Included are tying knots, splicing, making lashings, whippings, and proper use and storage of rope. 

While the skill of a sailor in the Age of Sail was often judged by how well he knew marlinespike seamanship, the knowledge it embraces involving docking a craft, towing, making repairs underway, and more is still critical for modern seafarers.

==Whippings==
A whipping knot is a means of holding the cut end of a rope together to prevent fraying and ensure ease of use. The simplest form is the common whipping. Constrictor knots can serve as temporary whippings while cutting ropes, as can a few layers of adhesive tape. 

Other fray-prevention techniques include back-splicing, aglets, or the application of a rubberized adhesive coating, resin, or paint to the cut end. Some modern synthetic fibers, such as nylon and polyester can make use of alternative methods such as fusion, which uses heat to melt the fibers to make a clean cut and permanent end; this technique cannot be used with non-melting fibers such as aramids.

However, the rope and knotting expert Geoffrey Budworth warns against the practice of fusing thus:
Sealing rope ends this way is lazy and dangerous. A tugboat operator once sliced the palm of his hand open down to the sinews after the hardened (and obviously &quot;sharp&quot;) end of a rope that had been heat-sealed pulled through his grasp. There is no substitute for a properly made whipping.

<text>Jamaica Plain is a neighborhood of in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Settled by Puritans seeking farmland to the south, it was originally part of Roxbury. The community seceded from Roxbury during the formation of West Roxbury in 1851 and became part of Boston when West Roxbury was annexed in 1874. In the 19th century, Jamaica Plain became one of the first streetcar suburbs in America and home to a significant portion of Boston&#x27;s Emerald Necklace of parks, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted.

In 2020, Jamaica Plain had a population of 41,012 according to the United States Census.

==History==
===Colonial era===

Shortly after the founding of Boston and Roxbury in 1630, William Heath&#x27;s family and three others settled on land just south of Parker Hill in what is now Jamaica Plain. In the next few years, William Curtis, John May and others set up farms nearby along Stony Brook, which flowed from south to north from Turtle Pond (in Hyde Park) to an outlet in the Charles River marshes in the current filled-in Fens area of Boston. John Polley followed with a farm which he purchased from Lt. Joshua Hewe in 1659 at the site of the present-day Soldier&#x27;s Monument at the intersection of South and Centre streets, closer to the &quot;Great Pond&quot;, later known as Jamaica Pond. Later, for services rendered during the Pequot War, Joseph Weld received a grant of of land between South Street and Centre Street. His son John built a home along South Street in the area which is now the Arnold Arboretum. The Weld family continued to live in the area for many generations.

In the late 1650s, the name &quot;Jamaica&quot; first appears on maps for the area of Roxbury between Stony Brook and the Great Pond. There are a number of theories regarding the origin of the name &quot;Jamaica Plain&quot;. A well-known theory traces the origin to &quot;Jamaica rum&quot;, a reference to Jamaican cane sugar&#x27;s role in the Triangle Trade of sugar, rum, and slaves. There were taverns on the Road to Dedham in the vicinity of Jamaica Plain. Another explanation is that &quot;Jamaica&quot;, though a different letter &quot;A&quot; pronunciation, is an Anglicization of the name of Kuchamakin, brother of Chickatawbut, the deceased sachem (chief) of the Massachusett tribe, who ruled the tribe as regent to Chickataubut&#x27;s minor son, Josias Wampatuck. In 1655, the English navy took the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, so it is also possible the area was named to honor this recent British victory.

On some maps, until the mid-19th century, the area was marked as &quot;Jamaica Plains&quot;.

John Ruggles and Hugh Thomas donated land in 1676 for the building of the community&#x27;s first school. A gift of of land south of the &quot;Great Pond&quot; by John Eliot provided financial support for the school, which was named the Eliot School (which still exists) in his honor.

During the 18th century, the farms of the Jamaica section of Roxbury transitioned from subsistence to market orientation, serving the growing Boston population. At the same time, wealthy men bought land and built estates in the bucolic countryside. In 1740, Benjamin Faneuil, nephew of Boston merchant Peter Faneuil, bought land between Centre Street and Stony Brook. In 1752, Commodore Joshua Loring bought the old Polley farm and built a home to which he retired. At Jamaica Pond, the provincial governor, Francis Bernard, built a summer home on .

In 1769, the community&#x27;s first church was built paid for by Susannah and Benjamin Pemberton before permission was granted from the two existing parishes of Roxbury. After many appeals and bargains, the families along South Street and to the west were released by the Second Parish in 1772 and the Third Parish of Roxbury was incorporated, and on May 26, 1773, the colonial legislature granted an act &quot;setting off the nine families and their lands from the First Precinct (or parish) of the Town of Roxbury and annexing to the Third Precinct in the said town.&quot; During the occupation of Boston, the colonial assembly met in this building. The church was the only church in Jamaica Plain for seventy years and during that time became one of the original Unitarian churches and continues on the same site now known as the First Church in Jamaica Plain. The original white clapboard building was replaced by the stone Romanesque Revival building in 1854 designed by the architect Nathaniel Bradlee. (Pictured above.)

The Minutemen from the Third Parish fought at Lexington and Bunker Hill under the command of Captain Lemuel Child and are commemorated on a plaque next to the Civil War Monument.

In 1775, troops from Rhode Island and Connecticut were quartered with residents of Jamaica Plain. General Washington stationed troops on Weld Hill, today&#x27;s Bussey Hill in the Arnold Arboretum. The units protected the road south to Dedham (Centre Street), where the American arsenal was kept, in case the British broke the siege of Boston.

With the American Revolution, many of the Tory estate owners fled the country, and were replaced by the rising elite of the new Boston. In 1777, John Hancock purchased an estate near the pond. The widow Ann Doane bought the estate once owned by Loyalist Joshua Loring (which is still standing, as the Loring-Greenough House). She soon was remarried, to attorney David S. Greenough. When Samuel Adams became governor of Massachusetts, he bought the former Peacock Tavern. It was located on Centre Street (near today&#x27;s Allandale Street and the Faulkner Hospital). With his wealth made in the China trade, James Perkins built his home, Pinebank, overlooking Jamaica Pond in 1802.

===Revolution to annexation===

The early years of the 19th century continued the trends of the post-Independence years. An aqueduct was built to Boston and inner Roxbury by the Jamaica Pond Aqueduct Corporation, which provided water to Boston, Roxbury and later the Town of West Roxbury, from 1795 to 1886. Carriages carried people to Roxbury and Boston on Centre Street (then, the Highway to Dedham), and in 1806 on the new Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike toll road (present day Washington Street). In 1826, &quot;hourlies&quot; ran from Jamaica Plain to Roxbury and Boston on a regular schedule, and the 1830s brought larger &quot;omnibuses&quot; to carry the growing passenger base. The first train line reached Jamaica Plain in 1834 when the Boston and Providence Rail Road began service, with special low &quot;commuter&quot; fares offered residents in 1839. Stops at Boylston Street and Tollgate (present day Forest Hills) were joined by a station at Woolsey Square (Green Street) at the request of local residents.

Green Street, laid out in 1836 to connect Centre Street and the Toll road, (Washington Street) became a hub of local artisans and builders. Soon after, Centre Street near Green Street became a retail main street, with grocers attracting local business providing products from the West Indies and common household goods. During the 1840s, as commuters from Boston settled in Jamaica Plain, the local market grew, with artisans and businesses - with proprietors living in the community - providing much of the needed products and services. In the Stony Brook valley along the rail line adjacent to Roxbury, a small industrial center formed, with small chemical factories, tanneries and soap factories taking advantage of the running water, isolation, access to transportation, and available land. Reflecting the growing population, a number of new churches were built. Four churches opened and served the new, more varied population.

By 1850, the once agricultural community had seen a significant change in its population. Only 10% of its heads of household were listed as farmers, while 28% were businessmen and professionals, and another 20% were Irish-born. In an effort to stem the increase in property taxes to support the rapidly urbanizing inner Roxbury area, the owners of the large estates in Jamaica Plain led a successful effort in 1851 to secede from Roxbury and form a new, suburban town of West Roxbury. Meanwhile, growth continued unabated. In 1850, David S. Greenough developed the south end of his family land into four streets, including today&#x27;s McBride Street. Three years later, he sold land along the east side of the railroad tracks for the new Jamaica Plain Gas Light Company. In 1857, the new West Roxbury Railroad Company extended their horse rail car line to a depot on South Street, at the site of today&#x27;s public housing project opposite McBride Street.

During the same years, ice houses lined the south shore of Jamaica Pond. Ice was harvested each winter by the Jamaica Plain Ice Company and sold in Boston and beyond until the 1890s, when the City of Boston bought the pond. During the China trade ships going toward the Orient needed ballast and excess harvested ice was used from the Pond. Ships went around Cape Horn up to San Francisco where the ice was sold. Continuing the transportation development that both served Jamaica Plain&#x27;s commuters and spurred further urban development, the Boston and Providence company added a second track in 1860, a third in 1870, and a fourth in 1890. Many of the new residents were Irish and Catholic, and to serve their needs the Archdiocese of Boston began construction of St Thomas Aquinas Church on South Street, with a grammar school following in 1873. In less than a generation, Jamaica Plain had changed significantly, and the wealthy estate owners no longer held power. In 1873, West Roxbury residents – most living in Jamaica Plain – voted in favor of annexation to Boston. The Town of West Roxbury had grown from 2,700 residents in 1850 to 9,000 in 1875, and many of the new residents wanted the advantages of the services (street grading, sewer lines) that the City of Boston could provide.

===Formation of Boston neighborhood===

As Jamaica Plain became a part of Boston, the rate of growth continued to increase. The triple decker house, a defining image in urban New England architecture, first showed up in the 1870s, and spread rapidly in the 1890s. In Jamaica Plain, the first commercial blocks were built in the 1870s, with the first brick commercial building erected in 1875. In 1873, the imposing brick police station was built on Seaverns Avenue, and a year later the recently built Eliot School was renamed West Roxbury High School, only to be changed to Jamaica Plain High School after annexation. 
The Stony Brook valley had long been the industrial center of Jamaica Plain. In 1871, the Haffenreffer brewery opened near Boylston and Amory Streets, taking advantage of the Stony Brook aquifer and the presence of German immigrants in the area. The same year, the Boylston &quot;Schul Verein&quot; German social club opened just across the railroad tracks, one of many organizations that served German residents in the neighborhood. To the south, the B.F. Sturtevant Company opened an industrial fan factory in 1878 along the railroad tracks between Williams and Green Street, which grew to employ 500 employees. In 1901, the factory suffered a massive fire and the company moved to Hyde Park several miles south.

The continued movement of both residents and businesses into the Stony Brook valley brought calls to contain the brook, prevent floods, and provide sewer drainage. During the 1870s, the brook was deepened and contained within wooden walls, but the spring thaw resulted in flooding of surrounding streets, and a new effort. Work continued until 1908, when the brook was placed into a shallow culvert from Forest Hills to its present outlet in the Boston Fens, behind the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In the following years, the brook that once defined the industrial heart of Jamaica Plain was largely forgotten, until it was memorialized by the new Stony Brook Orange Line station at Boylston Street.

Breweries continued to be major employers during these years. On Heath Street, the Highland Spring Brewery had been operating since 1867. In the 1880s, the Eblana and Park breweries and the American Brewing Company opened, taking advantage of local German and Irish immigrants to fill jobs. Franklin Brewery extended the beermaking district to Washington Street. These and other breweries were all closed to beer making during Prohibition, and few survived to reopen after repeal, although many found other uses, and some still stand. An exception was Haffenreffer, which continued until 1964. The old building now houses a number of commercial establishments, including the Boston Beer Company, brewers of Samuel Adams beer, as well as the nonprofit Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation. A late survivor was Croft Ale, brewed in the Highland Spring Brewery building until 1953, when it became the Rosoff Pickle factory, where the pickle vats could be seen from the commuter trains passing by.

A notable company that moved to Heath Street after prohibition was the Moxie soft drink company. Invented by Augustin Thompson in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1876, the company marketed the distinctively flavored Moxie to shift it from medicinal &quot;tonic&quot; to soft drink, much like Coca-Cola, and it outsold Coke in 1920. The company stopped advertising their distinctive product during the Great Depression, and never recovered their lost market share. After the plant closed in 1953, the building was torn down by the City of Boston for the new Bromley Heath public housing projects.

During the late 19th century, Jamaica Plain&#x27;s housing stock grew with the commercial development, providing homes for workers in local businesses and commuters as well. Sumner Hill, based on the old Greenough estate, became home to business owners and managers. In the 1880s, the Parley Vale estate and Robinwood Avenue were developed to serve the same market. Ten years later, Moss Hill Road and Woodland Road were laid out on land owned by the Bowditch family, creating the most exclusive neighborhood in Jamaica Plain until this day. At the same time, the land off South Street was being developed into streets and filled with houses for the working-class population, especially the Irish. By the early 20th century, the streets of Jamaica Plain were filled in, and houses or businesses were on most buildable plots. The entire housing stock of Jamaica Plain had been owned, divided, financed, built and sold largely by Jamaica Plain residents.

===Early 20th century===
The year 1900 brought another major employer to Jamaica Plain when Thomas Gustave Plant built a factory for his Queen Quality Shoe Company at Centre and Bickford Streets, said to be the largest women&#x27;s shoe factory in the world at the time, with five thousand workers. In order to avoid the labor strife that was common at the time, the company offered a park beside the factory, recreation rooms, a gym, library, dance hall, and sponsored sports teams that competed in local leagues. Shoes continued to be made in the building until the 1950s, but arson burned the massive brick structure down in 1976. The site is now home to a supermarket.

In 1900, Jamaica Plain had a significant immigrant population, which helped shape the future of the community. Many Irish had settled in large numbers in the Heath Street, South Street, Forest Hills and Stony Brook area (Brookside), taking laboring and domestic jobs, and becoming one-quarter of the population. Germans had reached 14%, living in Hyde Square, Egleston Square and Brookside, employed as skilled workers and managers, with their own social clubs and churches. Canadians, many from the Maritime Provinces, made up 12% of the population, often working in white collar or skilled jobs. Italians would come as well, in the years after 1910. New technologies allowed local businesses to provide jobs into the new century. In the 1910s, Randall-Faichney Company manufactured automobile parts, and the Holtzer-Cabot Company moved from making electric motors and telephone switching equipment to add electric automobiles.

Religion played a significant part in local life during these years. The increase in Catholic residents resulted in the building of new churches to join St Thomas Aquinas. Our Lady of Lourdes was built in 1896 in Brookside, and Blessed Sacrament, built to serve the residents of Hyde Square, was finished in 1917. St Andrews on Walk Hill street in Forest Hills came soon after. Each church had an elementary school that anchored the parish and bred a strong loyalty in parishioners, and in 1927, St Thomas parish added a high school, which remained open until 1975. Protestant churches inspired a similar local loyalty. Many of the local factory managers served in leadership positions in nearby churches. Central Congregational Church had women&#x27;s, children&#x27;s and missionary groups that brought neighbors of different economic classes together.

Other civic associations brought the people of Jamaica Plain together. In 1897, the Jamaica Plain Carnival Association formed to manage and promote the 4th of July parade, contests and fireworks. Two years later, the Jamaica Plain Businessmen&#x27;s Association formed to promote commercial development. Within three years, prominent community members were invited to join the newly named Jamaica Plain Citizen&#x27;s Association. The new group worked to encourage road improvement, playgrounds, lectures, schools, and other community amenities. In 1897, the Tuesday Club formed for women (who were not admitted to the other groups), and still exists at the Loring Greenough house.

In the late 19th century, Boston&#x27;s Emerald Necklace of parks was designed and built by Frederick Law Olmsted, with much of the southern section of the connecting parkland in or bordering on Jamaica Plain. Olmsted Park, Jamaica Pond, the Arnold Arboretum and Franklin Park have been enjoyed by generations of Jamaica Plain residents. The pond had long been the site of estates, which were torn down to make the new park. Fishing and ice skating were popular pastimes, and each winter ice was removed from the pond before the time of electric refrigeration. With the new park, homes and the commercial icehouses were removed. The Arboretum was developed on land originally owned by the Weld family, and donated by Benjamin Bussey, with financial support from the will of James Arnold. The Arboretum is now owned by the City of Boston, and managed by Harvard University.

Perhaps the most dramatic building project in Jamaica Plain history was the elevation of the train line above grade in the 1890s. In order to avoid accidents at street crossings, an embankment was built from Roxbury south through Forest Hills station, with bridges over all intersecting streets. The embankment cut through most of Jamaica Plain from north to south. In time, the housing along the embankment came to be devalued, and property to the east of the train line was cut off from the higher income sections of the community.

=== Redlining, decline and neighborhood activism ===

In the early 1970s, the city of Boston planned to extend I-95 from Canton north into downtown Boston. This threatened to bring I-95 straight through the center of Jamaica Plain, essentially dividing the community in half if executed. Many protests along with support from residents of Jamaica Plain, Roxbury and Hyde Park, rallied to stop the construction of the highway, including a now-annual community festival, called &quot;Wake Up The Earth&quot;, that mustered residents from surrounding neighborhoods in opposition to the highway. The project had already demolished hundreds of houses and commercial buildings in the highway&#x27;s path before then-Governor Francis W. Sargent ordered to stop the interstate project. In the 1980s, the Southwest Corridor in its present form was built, creating a parkway, bike path, and site for future Wake Up The Earth festivals in lieu of the highway, now situated atop the underground Orange Line.

By 1970, central Jamaica Plain was considered to be in a state of decline. The construction of the proposed highway coupled with and possibly contributing to a decision by Boston banks to cut back mortgage lending (redline) there began a cycle of disinvestment which led to the deterioration of the housing stock, slumlording and abandonment particularly in the central neighborhood along the edges of the corridor. In some cases, homeowners who could not sell due to lack of buyer financing simply walked away from older homes along the corridor&#x27;s periphery. Urban Edge, founded as a non-profit real estate firm in 1974, found it necessary to recruit volunteer tenants to physically take possession of empty properties to prevent vandalism and arson. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the average life span of an abandoned building was approximately one week. Windows were broken, copper plumbing was stripped out, and buildings were torched.

After conducting a research project that documented a dramatic decrease in mortgage lending between 1968 and 1972, activists launched the &quot;Jamaica Plain Community Investment Plan&quot;. The plan called upon local citizens to pledge to move their savings accounts to a local institution that would guarantee to invest that money in mortgages within Jamaica Plain. The plan eventually generated five hundred thousand dollars in pledges. In 1975 a contract was signed with the Jamaica Plain Cooperative Bank to implement the Community Investment plan.

In 1974, the community rallied and under the aegis of an Alinsky-style organizing project funded by The Ecumenical Social Action Committee (ESAC) a coalition of local churches contracted with an experienced Rhode Island–based community organizer, Richard W. &quot;Rick&quot; Wise, who built a series of neighborhood groups and a coalition of leaders into The Jamaica Plain Banking and Mortgage Committee and working with groups from other Boston neighborhoods, leveraged that into the citywide Boston Anti-Redlining Coalition (BARC), The coalition, chaired by long-time neighborhood activist Edwina &quot;Winky&quot; Cloherty, crafted a unique and ultimately successful campaign to force Boston Banks to reveal their lending patterns and a &quot;Greenlining campaign&quot; to both stimulate residential investment in the neighborhood. as well as to publicize and stop the redlining. In 2019, Richard Wise published a novel, Redlined, which outlines the essential elements of the anti-redlining campaign.

In October 1974, the committee was also successful in securing a pledge from Gubernatorial candidate Michael Dukakis to require that state chartered banks disclose their lending patterns annually by ZIP code. Upon his election, ignoring threats of litigation by the banks, Dukakis kept his word. On May 16, 1975, the new Banking Commissioner Carol S. Greenwald issued the first statewide mortgage disclosure regulation in the U.S. Subsequent studies based on data obtained by the banking commissioner demonstrated that there was indeed a pattern of disinvestment in the central neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain. Later that year, The Jamaica Plain Banking &amp; Mortgage Committee together with its citywide Boston Anti-Redlining Coalition (BARC) were part of a coalition, under the leadership of the Chicago-based National People&#x27;s Action, instrumental in the passage of the &quot;Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975&quot;. According to former commissioner Greenwald: &quot;Massachusetts success in getting the banks to reveal their lending policies was followed by similar actions in New York, California and Illinois.&quot;

In the following years, real estate prices stabilized, mortgage money became available and The Southwest Corridor Coalition a task force of local citizens broken down by neighborhoods and aided by state officials, put together a comprehensive master plan to redevelop the corridor. They decided to remove the elevated rapid transit train line on Washington Street and replace it with a below-grade line alongside the train tracks. With the new transit lines in place following the old train embankment, the Southwest Corridor park was built from Forest Hills north through the old Stony Brook valley.

Changes to the transit service through Jamaica Plain were followed with a change to the streetcar route as well. The Arborway line, which had been in service since 1903, had long been considered for replacement with bus service by the transportation authority. In 1977, trolley service on the Arborway line from downtown Boston was stopped at Heath Street, with buses continuing to Forest Hills. Service resumed, but were cut again in the 1980s, and has not been resumed since. This decision has been challenged by citizen groups in Jamaica Plain in the courts, and is still in dispute.

===Urban renewal===
In the 1980s low rents brought many students to the area, especially those who attended the Museum School, Mass Art, and Northeastern University, who often lived in collective households. The neighborhood also developed a lesbian and gay community. The presence of artists in the neighborhood led to the opening of local galleries and bookstores, and arts centers such as the Jamaica Plain Arts Center, which shared space in a vacated City of Boston Firehouse with Brueggers Bagel Company for several years. This site is currently the JP Licks ice cream store. Many first-time homebuyers were able to afford the house and condominium prices in Jamaica Plain during this time.

In the mid-1980s, an important music scene developed in Jamaica Plain which continues to the present day. Revitalization continued in the 1990s. Nonprofit housing groups bought rundown houses and vacant lots to create low-income rental units. During the same years, the former Plant Shoe Factory site was redeveloped as JP Plaza, a strip mall, and later a supermarket. A new facility for the Martha Eliot Health Center completed the site&#x27;s redevelopment. As part of a citywide effort, Boston Main Streets districts were named (Hyde/Jackson Square, Egleston Square, and Centre/South), bringing city funds and tools of neighborhood revitalization to local business owners.

===Demographics===

By the turn of the 21st century, the neighborhood had attracted a large community of college-educated professionals, political activists and artists. Examples of artist and activist organizations active or incorporated in Jamaica Plain include Grassroots International, Urbano Project, Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation, Boston Postdoctoral Association, City Life/Vida Urbana, JP Progressives, and Bikes Not Bombs.
Hyde, Jackson, and Egleston Squares have significant Spanish-speaking populations mainly from the Dominican Republic, but also from Puerto Rico and Cuba. As of 2010 the ethnic make-up of Jamaica Plain was 53.6% White (alone), 22% Hispanic or Latino (all races), 13.5% Black or African-American (alone), 7.9% Asian (alone), 3% Other.

In 2016, the neighborhood between Jackson Square and Hyde Square was officially designated the &quot;Latin Quarter&quot; by the city of Boston, after years of informal recognition by residents, Latin activists, and local politicians. The area has a large number of Latin owned businesses and residents, and is the center of local festivals, churches, and activist groups, such as La Piñata, the &quot;¡Viva! el Latin Quarter&quot; project of the Hyde Square Task Force, and nearby Vida Urbana. The newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; is based in Hyde Square.

The elimination of redlining and the stabilization of the real estate market in the late 1970s and the redevelopment of the Southwest Corridor set the stage for gentrification that began in the 1990s. A hot real estate market has driven dramatic increases in the value of older homes in the Parkside, Pondside and Sumner Hill neighborhoods and conversion of some larger residential properties and older commercial buildings into condominia. Numerous formerly vacant structures are being converted to residential use, among them the ABC Brewery, the Gormley Funeral Home, the Eblana Brewery, the Oliver Ditson Company, 319 Centre Street, Jackson Square, JP Cohousing, Blessed Sacrament, Our Lady of the Way, and 80 Bickford Street.

The oldest community theater group in the US, Footlight Club, is based out of Eliot Hall in this neighborhood, on Eliot Street.

==Geography==

===Sub-neighborhoods===

Jamaica Plain is made up of a number of distinct historical sub-districts. Some of the names are now archaic, used less by longtime residents than scholars and real estate agents.

===Green spaces===
Jamaica Plain, often referred to in the 19th century as &quot;the Eden of America&quot;, is one of the greenest neighborhoods in the city of Boston. The community contains or is bordered by a number of jewels of the Emerald Necklace park system designed in the 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted:

*Olmsted Park: from Route 9 at the Riverway south to Perkins Street, including Leverett Pond, Willow Pond, and Ward&#x27;s Pond
*Jamaica Pond: has of surface area and is the largest and deepest body of fresh water in Boston
*Arnold Arboretum: is a world-renowned plant collection maintained by Harvard University, and contains Peters&#x27; Hill, named for Boston Mayor Andrew J. Peters, the highest elevation in Jamaica Plain at 
*Franklin Park: is a park (the largest in the city) and holds the Franklin Park Zoo (the largest zoo in New England), White Stadium and the William J. Devine Memorial Golf Course

These parks are connected by parkways, each of which is also part of the Emerald Necklace. From south to north these are the Arborway, the Jamaicaway, and the Riverway.

The area also includes Forest Hills Cemetery, a “garden cemetery”, and hundreds more acres of cemetery that stretch along Walk Hill Street offer more green space to the area.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===
Students in Jamaica Plain are served by Boston Public Schools (BPS). BPS assigns students based on preferences of the applicants and priorities of students in various zones. The English High School located in Jamaica Plain is one of the first public high schools in America.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston operates Roman Catholic schools. In spring 2009 the archdiocese announced that Our Lady of Lourdes School, a K–8 school and the last Catholic school in Jamaica Plain, will close unless parents raise $500,000 for one additional year of instruction. In spring 2009 the school had 187 students, which was 30 fewer students than its 2005 count.

Private schools in the area include the British School of Boston and Showa Boston Institute for Language and Culture.

==Transportation==
Jamaica Plain is served by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)&#x27;s bus and rail services.

Major roads are Centre Street, the Jamaicaway (formerly US 1), the Arborway (MA 203), Washington Street, South Street, and South Huntington Avenue.

===Public transportation===
The Green Line&#x27;s E branch streetcar service terminates at Heath Street and South Huntington Avenue. Bus service continues along South Huntington Avenue, Centre Street, and South Street to its terminus at the Forest Hills Station. The E branch originally continued through Jamaica Plain to its terminus at Arborway station, adjacent to Forest Hills Station. The Orange Line rapid transit train line runs below street level through the middle of Jamaica Plain, with stops at Jackson Square, Stony Brook, Green Street, and Forest Hills. Buses connect Jamaica Plain with Roslindale, West Roxbury, Hyde Park, and suburban Dedham, Westwood and Walpole to the south, and the rest of Boston by street routes. The 39 bus is the primary Jamaica Plain bus route, and is one of Boston&#x27;s most-used bus lines. The Forest Hills Station is a major transportation hub and is within walking distance of the Arnold Arboretum and Forest Hills Cemetery.

The E branch was &quot;temporarily&quot; suspended from Heath Street to Forest Hills in the mid-1980s, but proposals to restore the service have caused considerable tension in the area. Some residents and commuters want the restoration of the branch, which is seen as a reconnection with the rest of the city. However, others state that the #39 bus along the old route, and the Orange Line just a few blocks away, duplicate the extension.

===Commuter rail===
The Needham Line of the Commuter Rail stops at Forest Hills Station, and many other lines are easily accessible by riding the Orange Line subway train to Ruggles and Back Bay.

===Cars and parking===
Municipal parking lots are located off Centre Street at Burroughs Street in Jamaica Plain Center, across from the Mary Curley School on Centre Street at Spring Park Ave., and across from Blessed Sacrament Church in Hyde Square. There are few parking meters in Jamaica Plain; on-street parking is free. Many streets near the MBTA Orange Line stations are posted &quot;resident permit only&quot; during working hours (8 AM to 6 PM). This is intended to discourage commuters from using residential streets as parking lots during the day.

===Bicycle paths===
Two major bicycle paths serve Jamaica Plain. Along the Southwest Corridor Park is the Pierre Lallement Bicycle Path, which runs from Forest Hills to Back Bay. To the west are bicycle paths, which run through the parks of the Emerald Necklace, along the Jamaicaway and Riverway.

<doc id="437002" wikidata="Q355188" url="?curid=437002" title="Roméo Dallaire">
<text>Roméo Antonius Dallaire (born June 25, 1946) is a retired Canadian politician and military officer who was a senator from Quebec from 2005 to 2014, and a lieutenant-general in the Canadian Armed Forces. He notably was the force commander of UNAMIR, the ill-fated United Nations peacekeeping force for Rwanda between 1993 and 1994, and for trying to stop the genocide that was being waged by Hutu extremists against Tutsis. Dallaire is a Senior Fellow at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS) and co-director of the MIGS Will to Intervene Project.

==Early life and education==

Roméo Antonius Dallaire was born in Denekamp, Netherlands to Staff-Sergeant Roméo Louis Dallaire, a Canadian non-commissioned officer, and Catherine Vermeassen, a Dutch nurse. Dallaire came to Canada with his mother as a six-month-old baby on the &quot;Empire Brent&quot;, landing in Halifax on December 13, 1946. He spent his childhood in Montreal.

He enrolled in the Canadian Army in 1963, as a cadet at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean. In 1970 he graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned into The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery.

In 1971, Dallaire applied for a Canadian passport to travel overseas with his troops and was surprised to discover that his birth in the Netherlands as the son of a Canadian soldier did not automatically make him a Canadian citizen. He has subsequently become a Canadian citizen.

Dallaire has also attended the Canadian Land Force Command and Staff College, the United States Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, VA, and the British Higher Command and Staff Course.

He commanded the . On July 3, 1989, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. He then commanded the 5th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. He was also the commandant of Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean from 1990 to 1993.

==Rwanda==
=== Original mission ===
In late 1993, Dallaire received his commission as the Force Commander of UNAMIR, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. Rwanda was in the middle of a civil war between the extremist Hutu government and a small Tutsi rebel faction. UNAMIR&#x27;s goal was to assist in the implementation of the Arusha Accords. The Hutus worked through the Rwandan army and then-president of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, and the Tutsis through the rebel commander Paul Kagame, who is the president of Rwanda today. When Dallaire arrived in Rwanda, his mandate was to supervise the implementation of the Accords during a transitional period in which Tutsis were supposed to be given positions of power within the Hutu government.

There were early signs that something was amiss when, on January 22, 1994, a French DC-8 aircraft landed in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, loaded with ammunition and weapons for the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). FAR was the Hutu army under Habyarimana&#x27;s control. Dallaire was unable to seize the weapons, as this would have violated his UN mandate. 

The Chief of Staff of the Rwandan Army told Dallaire that since the munitions were ordered before Arusha, the UN was not allowed to detain the shipment, and displayed paperwork showing that the weapons had been sent by Belgium, Israel, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Egypt. In addition to the arms deliveries, troops from the Rwandan government began checking identity cards which identified individuals as Hutus or Tutsis. These cards would later allow Hutu militias to identify their victims with accuracy.

===Deteriorating conditions===

On the night of 6 April 1994, an airplane carrying Habyarimana was shot down over Kigali Airport. The President of Burundi was also on board. Coincidentally, wreckage from the crash landed in Habyarimana&#x27;s own backyard. Following the airplane crash, Hutu extremists, with help from the Rwandan government and the Rwandan Armed Forces, blamed the assassination on the Tutsis and used this as a pretext for systematic execution of the Tutsis faction, as well as many of the moderate elected officials of the new government. Dallaire immediately ordered ten Belgian soldiers to protect the new prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, but Madame Agathe and her husband were killed, and later the next day, the Belgian soldiers were found dead.

The ten Belgian UN Paracommandos had been intercepted by the Rwandan government forces (FAR), taken to a military camp as hostages, and murdered there. Passing the entrance of the camp on his way to a meeting of the FAR commanders, Gen. Dallaire caught a glimpse of some bodies on the ground. In a 2007 trial in Belgium, the Rwandan camp commander charged with the peacekeepers&#x27; murder testified that he had warned Gen. Dallaire that they were going to be killed, and that Dallaire had promised to send help. Storming Camp Kigali was beyond the means of his meagre force, however, and instead, he forbade the other Belgian troops to take action. 

Colonel Luc Marchal, commander of UNAMIR forces in the Kigali sector, has defended this decision on the grounds that to attack would have put the ill-equipped UNAMIR forces in an adversarial role against the Rwandan military, escalated the situation, and endangered their lives and those of the 331 unarmed UN observers. In the 2007 trial of the Rwandan officer Bernard Ntuyahaga on charges of allowing the massacre to take place, Belgian Investigating judge Damien Vandermeersch cited among other &quot;obstacles to his work, the refusal of the United Nations to allow him to hear from General Romeo Dallaire.&quot; But Dallaire had testified extensively before the ICTR in 2004 about the peacekeepers and other matters, all of which was a matter of public record available to Judge Vandermeersch, and in which a decision was pending. Colonel Théoneste Bagosora was later convicted by ICTR in December 2008 of being responsible for the peacekeepers&#x27; murders.

Seeing the situation in Rwanda deteriorating rapidly, Dallaire pleaded for logistical support and reinforcements of 2,000 soldiers for UNAMIR; he estimated that a total of 5,000 well-equipped troops would give the UN enough leverage to put an end to the killings. The UN Security Council refused, partly due to US opposition. US policy on interventions had become skeptical following the death of several U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia the year before; this new policy was outlined in Presidential Decision Directive 25 by President Clinton. The Security Council voted to reduce UNAMIR further to 270 troops . 

Since the UN mandate had not changed, the Belgian troops started evacuating, and the Europeans withdrew. As the Belgians departed on 19 April, Dallaire felt an acute sense of betrayal; &#x27;I stood there as the last Hercules left...and I thought that almost exactly fifty years to the day my father and my father-in-law had been fighting in Belgium to free the country from fascism, and there I was, abandoned by Belgian soldiers. So profoundly did I despise them for it...I found it inexcusable.&#x27;

===Genocide===

Following the withdrawal of Belgian forces, whom Dallaire considered his best-trained and best-equipped, Dallaire consolidated his contingent of Pakistani, Canadian, Ghanaian, Tunisian, and Bangladeshi soldiers in urban areas and focused on providing areas of &quot;safe control&quot; in and around Kigali. Most of Dallaire&#x27;s efforts were to defend specific areas where he knew Tutsis to be hiding. Dallaire&#x27;s staff—including the U.N.&#x27;s unarmed observers—often relied on its U.N. credentials to save Tutsis, heading off Interahamwe attacks even while being outnumbered and outgunned. Dallaire and his staff are credited with saving the lives of 32,000 people.

Dallaire gave the major force contributors different evaluations for their work. In his book, he gave the Tunisian and Ghanaian contingents high praise for their valiant and competent work. Ghana lost three peacekeepers. On the other hand, he criticized the Bangladeshi contingent for being poorly trained and poorly equipped. He was especially critical of the Bangladeshi contingent&#x27;s leadership because of their incompetence and lack of loyalty to the mission and UN chain of command.

===End to the Genocide===

As the massacre progressed and press accounts of the genocide grew, the U.N. Security Council backtracked on its position and voted to establish UNAMIR II, with a strength of 5,500 men in response to the French plan to occupy portions of the country. The so-called Operation Turquoise, the presence of French troops, was initially opposed by Dallaire because the French had a history of backing the Hutus and the Rwandan Armed Forces, and thus their presence would be opposed by Kagame and the rebel RPF. It was not until early July, when RPF troops under Kagame swept into Kigali, that the genocide ended. By August, the French had handed their portion of the country to the RPF, giving Kagame effective control of all of Rwanda.

As revealed through testimony at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the genocide was brutally efficient, lasting for a total of 100 days and leading to the murder of between 800,000 and 1,171,000 Tutsi, Hutu moderates and Twa. Over two million people were displaced internally or in neighbouring countries. The Genocide ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front gained control of Rwanda on July 18, 1994, though recrimination, retribution, and criminal prosecutions continue to the present day.

===Controversy===
Dallaire has been criticized by retired Canadian General Lewis MacKenzie for protecting UN soldiers when 10 Belgian paratroopers were killed on duty.

It has been alleged by the families that Dallaire failed to intervene while passing just 20 yards from the paratroopers. Belgian authorities have stated that they would seek a penal indictment over his role in the deaths of the Belgian paratroopers.

Dallaire was later criticized by the Belgian parliamentary commission for not preventing the murder of ten members of the 2nd Commando Battalion. In his answer to the martial council he would later say, &quot;I did not know whether they were dead or injured.&quot; He went on to meet officers of the Rwanda army at the Military School, but did not mention the event. The company of the Bangladeshi Battalion which had the task of Quick Reaction Force was ill-prepared and did not leave their barracks. After those events Belgium withdrew its forces from Rwanda. Dallaire considered them to be his best-trained and best-equipped forces. 

The commission of inquiry of the Belgian Senate in 1998 severely condemned Dallaire&#x27;s actions during those days, stating it was &quot;imprudent and unprofessional to have the Belgian escorts provided on 7 April with so few military precautions&quot;. In addition, the commission stated it &quot;did not understand why general Dallaire, who had noted the blue beret bodies in the Kigali camp, did not communicate this immediately to the FAR&#x27;s high-ranking officers at the meeting of the École supérieure and did not demand the urgent intervention of those Rwandan officers present. This appears to reflect considerable indifference on his part. Moreover, general Dallaire also neglected to inform his sector commander about what he had seen and to give the necessary instructions&quot;.

The Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs, during an interview, states that &quot;...Dallaire was insulting in his comments and whose cowardice was demonstrated by a lack of responsibility when the situation required leadership on his part&quot;.

In his book, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda&quot;, General Dallaire details his decision to send 10 soldiers to protect the Prime Minister during the &quot;apocalyptic&quot; first hours of the genocide.

===Life after Rwanda===
Upon his return to Canada from UNOMUR and UNAMIR, Dallaire was appointed to two simultaneous commands in September 1994: Deputy Commander of Land Force Command (LFC) in Saint-Hubert, Quebec and Commander of 1 Canadian Division. In October 1995, Dallaire assumed command of Land Force Quebec Area.

In 1996, Dallaire was promoted to Chief of Staff and to the Assistant Deputy Minister (Personnel) Group at NDHQ. In 1998 he was assigned to Assistant Deputy Minister (Human Resources – Military) and in 1999 was appointed Special Advisor to the Chief of the Defence Staff on Officer Professional Development.

Dallaire suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder and, in 2000, attempted suicide by combining alcohol with his anti-depressant medication, a near fatal combination which left him comatose.
Dallaire is an outspoken supporter of raising awareness for veterans&#x27; mental health.

In January 2004, Dallaire appeared at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to testify against Colonel Théoneste Bagosora. The testimony was critical to the outcome of the trial, and in December 2008 Bagosora was convicted of genocide and for the command responsibility of the murders of the 10 Belgian Peacekeepers. The trial chamber held that: &quot;it is clear that the killing of the peacekeepers formed part of the widespread and systematic attack&quot;, while at the same time holding that: &quot;the evidence suggests that these killings were not necessarily part of a highly coordinated plan.&quot;

He later worked as a Special Advisor to the Canadian Government on War Affected Children and the Prohibition of Small Arms Distribution, as well as with international agencies with the same focus, including child labour. He is a great proponent of the concept of institutionalism, and, in 2004–2005, he was a fellow at the Carr Center For Human Rights Policy at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He endorses the Genocide Intervention Network.

Dallaire was appointed to the Canadian Senate by Prime Minister Paul Martin on March 24, 2005. He sits as a Liberal, representing the province of Quebec. Dallaire noted that his family has supported both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Quebec Liberal Party since 1958. He was a strong supporter of Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s unsuccessful 2006 bid for the leadership of the federal Liberal Party.

In 2007, Dallaire called for the reopening of Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, saying &quot;The possibility of starting a new program at the college—a military Cegep that would allow all officer cadets to spend two years in Saint-Jean before going to Kingston, instead of studying only in Kingston—is being considered. In the spirit of progress, would it be possible to support a principle as basic as the freedom of francophones in the Canadian Armed Forces by establishing a Cegep-style francophone bilingual military college.&quot;

Concordia University announced on September 8, 2006, that Dallaire would sit as Senior Fellow at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS), a research centre based at the university&#x27;s Faculty of Arts &amp; Science. Later that month, on September 29, 2006, he issued a statement urging the international community to be prepared to defend Bahá&#x27;ís in Iran from possible atrocities.

Dallaire has worked to bring an understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder to the general public. He was a visiting lecturer at several Canadian and American universities. He was a Fellow of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He pursued research on conflict resolution and the use of child soldiers. He has written several articles and chapters in publications on conflict resolution, humanitarian assistance and human rights.

==In the media==
In Samantha Power&#x27;s 2002 landmark work on genocide in the 20th century, &quot;A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide&quot;, Sen. Dallaire features largely in the recounting of the Rwanda Genocide. Power also wrote the foreword to Dallaire&#x27;s book, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;. In a 2004 opinion article published by the New York Times, Dallaire called upon NATO to intervene militarily alongside African Union troops to abort the genocide in Darfur. He concluded that, &quot;having called what is happening in Darfur genocide and having vowed to stop it, it is time for the West to keep its word as well.&quot;

== Documentary and film ==
In October 2002, the documentary &quot;The Last Just Man&quot; was released, which chronicles the Rwandan genocide and features interviews with Dallaire, Brent Beardsley, and others involved in the events that happened in Rwanda. It was directed by Steven Silver.

A documentary film, entitled &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Roméo Dallaire&quot;, which was inspired by the book and shows Gen Dallaire&#x27;s return to Rwanda after ten years, was produced by the CBC, SRC and White Pine Pictures, and released in 2004. The film was nominated for two Sundance Film Festival Awards, winning the 2004 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for World Cinema - Documentary and a nomination for Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema - Documentary. The film aired on CBC on January 31, 2005.

In 2004, PBS Frontline featured a documentary named &quot;The Ghosts of Rwanda&quot;. In an interview conducted for the documentary and recorded over the course of four days in October 2003, Dallaire said: &quot;Rwanda will never ever leave me. It&#x27;s in the pores of my body. My soul is in those hills, my spirit is with the spirits of all those people who were slaughtered and killed that I know of, and many that I didn&#x27;t know...&quot;

The 2004 film &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; featured a Canadian Forces colonel assigned to UN peacekeeping based on Dallaire, played by Nick Nolte. Dallaire is quoted as saying that neither the producer, nor Nolte himself, consulted with him before shooting the film. He said further that he did not agree with Nolte&#x27;s portrayal, but did think that the film was &quot;okay.&quot;

A Canadian dramatic feature film &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil,&quot; adapted from Dallaire&#x27;s 2003 book and starring Roy Dupuis as Lieutenant-General Dallaire, started production in mid-June 2006, and was released on 28 September 2007. Dallaire participated in a press conference about the film held on June 2, 2006, in Montreal, a film for which he was consulted, as opposed to &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;. The film earned 12 Genie Award nominations and won one in the category Best Achievement in Music - Original Song for the song &quot;Kaya&quot; by Valanga Khoza and David Hirschfelder. In September 2007, &quot;Shake Hands With The Devil&quot; won the Emmy award for Outstanding Documentary with The Documentary Channel, who presented it on their channel.

=== Song ===
Dallaire is the inspiration for the song &quot;Kigali&quot; by Canadian singer-songwriter Jon Brooks. The song appears on his album &quot;Ours And The Shepherds&quot;, which is about Canadian war stories and the problems faced by returning soldiers. His first verse is taken directly from Dallaire&#x27;s book.

Also, &quot;Roméo Dallaire&quot; is the title of a folk song written by Canadian folk songwriter Andy McGaw. McGaw&#x27;s song points squarely at the indifference and failure of the United Nations surrounding the Rwanda genocide.

Chorus of McGaw&#x27;s song:
:Thank you for callin&#x27; the United Nations
:We can&#x27;t take your call right now cause we&#x27;re all on vacation
:If you need support hug your teddy bear
:If you&#x27;re in big trouble boys better say your prayers

Dallaire is the subject of the song &quot;Run Roméo Run&quot; on the 2006 album &quot;The Great Western&quot; by Welshman James Dean Bradfield.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1996, Dallaire was made an Officer of the Legion of Merit of the United States, the highest military decoration available for award to foreigners, for his service in Rwanda. Dallaire was also awarded the inaugural Aegis Trust Award in 2002, and on October 10 of the same year, he was inducted as an Officer in the Order of Canada.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; program saw Dallaire voted, in 16th place, as the highest rated military figure. Several months after the broadcast, on March 9, 2005, Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson awarded Dallaire with the 25th Pearson Peace Medal. On October 11, 2006, the Center for Unconventional Security Affairs at the University of California, Irvine awarded Dallaire with the 2006 Human Security Award.

Dallaire has received honorary doctorates from a large number of Canadian and American universities. He received Doctor of Laws degrees from University of Saskatchewan, St. Thomas University, Boston College, the University of Calgary, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Athabasca University, Trent University, the University of Victoria, the University of Western Ontario, and Simon Fraser University, and an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from the University of Lethbridge. 

In June 2006, Dallaire was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters by the Queens College of the City University of New York (CUNY) in recognition of his efforts in Rwanda and afterwards to speak out against genocide. He received an ovation from the crowd for his comment that &quot;no human is more human than any other&quot;. Dallaire was named a Fellow of the Ryerson Polytechnic University, and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

His book &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda&quot; was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for Non-Fiction in 2004.

General Dallaire planted a tree at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, Accra, Ghana in 2007 at the invitation of the Commandant, Major-General John Attipoe.

Dallaire was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2002, Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2005. He was granted the Aegis Award for Genocide Prevention from the Aegis Trust (United Kingdom).

Dallaire was a recipient of the Vimy Award.

As part of the 50th Anniversary commemoration of the founding of the Pugwash Peace Exchange, in 2007 General Dallaire accepted Sir Joseph Rotblat&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize.

There are elementary schools named after Dallaire in Vaughan, Ontario, Winnipeg, Manitoba and Ajax, Ontario.

Also, a street is named after him in the Lincoln Park neighbourhood of Calgary, Alberta. 

Dallaire was one of the eight Olympic Flag bearers at the opening ceremony for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver.

<text>Andrija Mohorovičić (23 January 1857 – 18 December 1936) was a Croatian geophysicist. He is best known for the eponymous Mohorovičić discontinuity and is considered one of the founders of modern seismology.

==Early years==

Mohorovičić was born in Volosko, Opatija, where his father (also named Andrija), was a blacksmith, making anchors. The younger Andrija also loved the sea and married a captain&#x27;s daughter, Silvija Vernić. They had four sons. Mohorovičić obtained his elementary education in his home town, then continued at the gymnasium of neighbouring Rijeka. He received his higher education in mathematics and physics at the Faculty of Philosophy in Prague in 1875, where one of his professors was Ernst Mach. At 15, Mohorovičić knew Italian, English and French. Later he learned German, Latin, and Ancient Greek.
==Career in education==
He taught first at high school in Zagreb (1879–1880), then at secondary school in Osijek. From 1882, he taught for nine years at the Royal Nautical School in Bakar, near Rijeka. Work started or completed there was important to his later scientific career. From 1893, when he became a corresponding member of the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb, to 1917–18 he taught in the fields of geophysics and astronomy. In 1898 he became a full member of what was then the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb, where he was a private docent. In 1910 he became a titular associate university professor.

==Meteorology==
In Bakar he was first exposed to meteorology, which he taught at the Royal Nautical School. This influenced him to the extent that he founded the local meteorological station in 1887. He made systematic studies and both invented and constructed instruments to observe precipitation in Croatia and Slavonia. At his own request in 1891, he was transferred to the secondary school in Zagreb where, in 1892, he soon became a head of the Meteorological Observatory in Grič and established a service for all Croatia, while teaching geophysics and astronomy at the university.

On 13 March 1892, he observed the tornado in Novska, which picked up a 13-ton railway carriage with fifty passengers and threw it 30 m. He observed also the &quot;vihor&quot; (whirlwind) near Čazma in 1898 and studied the climate in Zagreb. Mohorovičić was the first person to describe atmospheric rotors with a horizontal axis, which he observed during bora-wind episodes in the northern Adriatic. In his last paper on meteorology (1901), he discussed the decrease in atmospheric temperature with height. His observations of clouds formed the basis of his doctoral thesis &quot;On the Observation of Clouds, the Daily and Annual Cloud Period in Bakar&quot; presented to the University of Zagreb and which earned him his degree as doctor of philosophy in 1893.

==Seismology==
On 8 October 1909 an earthquake occurred with its epicenter in the Pokuplje region, 39 km southeast of Zagreb. A number of seismographs, installed beforehand, provided invaluable data, which led Mohorovičić to new discoveries. He concluded that when seismic waves strike the boundary between different types of material, they are reflected and refracted, just as light is when striking a prism, and that when earthquakes occur, two waves—longitudinal and transverse—propagate through the earth with different velocities. By analyzing data from more observation posts, Mohorovičić concluded that the Earth has several layers above a core. He was the first to establish, based on the evidence from seismic waves, the discontinuity that separates the Earth&#x27;s crust from its mantle. This is now called the Mohorovičić discontinuity or (because of the complexity of that name) &quot;Moho&quot;. According to Mohorovičić, a layered structure would explain the observation of depths where seismic waves change speed and the difference in chemical composition between rocks from the crust and those from the mantle. From the data, he estimated the thickness of the upper layer (crust) to be 54 km. Geophysicists subsequently determined that the crust is 5–9 km below the ocean floor and 25–60 km below the continents, which rest on tectonic plates.
Subsequent study of the Earth&#x27;s interior confirmed the existence of the discontinuity under all continents and oceans.

Mohorovičić assumed that the velocity of seismic waves increases with the depth. The function he proposed to calculate the velocity of seismic waves is called the Mohorovičić law. He developed a method for determining earthquake epicenters and constructed curves giving the travel-times of seismic waves over distances of up to 10,000 miles from their source. He also proposed the construction of a new type of seismograph for recording ground horizontal movement, but due to lack of funds the project was never realized.

As early as 1909 Mohorovičić started giving lectures recommending standards that both architects and building contractors should follow - he was ahead of his time in setting some of the basic principles of earthquake-resistant design. Mohorovičić&#x27;s theories were visionary and were only truly understood many years later from detailed observations of the effects of earthquakes on buildings, deep focus earthquakes, locating earthquake epicenters, Earth models, seismographs, harnessing the energy of the wind, hail-defence and other related elements of the geological body of knowledge known as geoscience.

== Legacy ==
The crater Mohorovičić on the far side of the Moon is named in his honour. A gymnasium in Rijeka, Croatia and a school ship in the Croatian Navy are named after him, as was (in 1996) asteroid 8422 Mohorovičıć.

<text>José Antonio Labordeta Subías (10 March 1935, in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain – 19 September 2010, Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain) was a Spanish (Aragonese) singer, songwriter, poet, writer and political activist. He was described by The &quot;Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa&quot; 2000 (&quot;Great Aragonese Encyclopedia&quot;) as &quot;The most important Aragonese singer-songwriter&quot;. He began singing in an attempt to give more relevance to his poetry; his songs are well-known and beloved anthems in Aragón. Poetic songs such as &quot;Aragón&quot;, &quot;Canto a la Libertad&quot; (&quot;Song for Freedom&quot;) or &quot;Me dicen que no quieres&quot; (&quot;They tell me you don&#x27;t want to&quot;) were also sung all around Spain.

He was also the founder of the &quot;Andalán&quot; newspaper, which was very influential during the 1970s. From 2000 until retiring in 2008, he represented Zaragoza in the Spanish Congress for Chunta Aragonesista &quot;(Aragonese Union)&quot;, an Aragonese political party.

==Biography==
José Antonio Labordeta was born in Zaragoza, Aragón, in 1935. In 1953, his father died. José Antonio went to live with his older brother Miguel, who was married and fourteen years his senior.

In 1963, Labordeta married Juana de Grandes, and the newly wed couple moved to Teruel. Two of their daughters, Ana and Ángela, were born while the couple was living there.

He died on 19 September 2010 in Zaragoza at age 75 after a long battle with prostate cancer.

<text>Catherine Bach (born Catherine Bachman; March 1, 1954) is an American actress. She is known for playing Daisy Duke in the television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and Margo Dutton in &quot;African Skies&quot;. In 2012, she joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Anita Lawson.

== Early life ==
Bach was born in Warren, Ohio, the daughter of Norma Jean Kucera (née Verdugo), an acupuncturist, and Bernard P. Bachman, a rancher. Her mother was a daughter of Antonio L. Verdugo, of Bisbee, Arizona, a baker born in Mexico, while her father was of German ancestry. She was raised in Warren, Ohio. Her mother, born into the Verdugo family, claimed to be descended from one of oldest Californio families. 

She spent some of her childhood on a ranch in South Dakota, and she visited her grandparents in Faith, South Dakota. In 1970, Bach graduated from 
Stevens High School in Rapid City, South Dakota. She briefly majored in drama at UCLA, where she supplemented her income by making clothes for friends and theater groups.

==Career==
Bach&#x27;s professional debut was as one of the children in a production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Bach&#x27;s first screen appearance was in the Burt Lancaster murder mystery, &quot;The Midnight Man&quot;, shot in upstate South Carolina in 1973, in which she played murder victim Natalie Claiburn. Her next role was Melody in the 1974 film &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;.

Bach heard about the audition for &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; through her husband. When she arrived there, she found the producers were looking for a Dolly Parton-lookalike; despite not looking like what they were searching for, she was hired on the spot. One of the earliest costume ideas from the producers was that she wear a tight white turtleneck, go-go boots and a poodle skirt, but Bach asked if she could bring her own outfit, which was a homemade T-shirt, a pair of cut-off denim shorts and high heels. Bach had concerns about the appropriateness of the cut-off shorts at first, saying she could not wear them in a restaurant scene. When prompted by the producers to visit a restaurant across the street, Bach found the waitresses were wearing &quot;little miniskirts that matched the tablecloths!&quot; This style of cut-off denim shorts is now popularly known as &quot;Daisy Dukes&quot; in reference to Bach&#x27;s character of that name from the show. She starred on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; opposite Tom Wopat, John Schneider and James Best.

At the suggestion of the show&#x27;s producers, Bach posed as Daisy Duke for a poster, which sold 5 million copies. The poster once caused a stir when Nancy Reagan took a liking to it after Bach visited the White House with one as a gift for one of her former schoolteachers then working there.

While she was starring on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, her legs were insured for $1,000,000. In 1985, she served as the model for the figurehead for the schooner &quot;Californian&quot;.

After the series ended, Bach had roles in a number of low-profile films. From 1992 to 1994, she starred in the Canadian family drama series, &quot;African Skies&quot;. In 2006, she guest-starred on &quot;Monk&quot;, and in 2010 had a small cameo in the comedy film &quot;You Again&quot;. In 2012, Bach joined the cast of CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in the recurring role of Anita Lawson.

In 2002, Bach launched a line of diamond jewelry at Debenhams.

==Personal life==
Bach married David Shaw (stepson of Angela Lansbury) in 1976; the couple divorced in 1981. Bach married entertainment lawyer Peter Lopez in August 1990. They had two daughters. On April 30, 2010, 60-year-old Lopez was found shot dead in an apparent suicide.

Bach is Catholic.

<text>Lagenorhynchus is a genus of oceanic dolphins in the infraorder Cetacea, presently containing six extant species. However, there is consistent molecular evidence that the genus is polyphyletic and several of the species are likely to be moved to other genera. In addition, the extinct species &quot;Lagenorhynchus harmatuki&quot; is also classified in this genus.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;lagenos&quot; meaning &quot;bottle&quot; and &quot;rhynchus&quot; meaning &quot;beak&quot;. Indeed, the &quot;bottle-nose&quot; is a characteristic of this genus. However, the dolphins popularly called bottlenose dolphins belong in the genus &quot;Tursiops&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
There is compelling phylogenetic molecular evidence that the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; is polyphyletic, in that it currently contains several species that are not closely related.
 found that white-beaked and Atlantic white-sided dolphins are phylogenetically isolated within the Delphinidae, where they are believed to be rather basal members of the family, along with the orca (subfamily Orcininae).

The remaining four species in the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus—&quot;the Pacific white-sided dolphin, Peale&#x27;s dolphin, hourglass dolphin and the dusky dolphin—are consistently placed within the Lissodelphininae subfamily, in studies of molecular phylogeny, together with the right whale dolphin and the four species of the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; (including Hector&#x27;s dolphin). Some authors have suggested these four species be placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Sagmatias&quot;. However, other molecular studies place the hourglass and Peale&#x27;s dolphins, phylogenetically, within the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; and do not agree with inclusion in a new genus (together with Pacific white-sided dolphin and dusky dolphin). 

This phylogeny is supported by acoustic and morphological data; both the hourglass and Peale&#x27;s dolphins share, with the other species of &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;, a distinctive type of echolocation signal known as a narrow-band/high-frequency signal. This signal is also used by porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the pygmy sperm whales (Kogiidae), but is not found among other dolphins. According to , Peale&#x27;s dolphin, and the other &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; species, are the only dolphins that do not &quot;whistle&quot;; presumably, this would be the case for hourglass dolphins, as well. Peale&#x27;s dolphin also shares with several &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; species the possession of a distinct white marking behind the pectoral (“armpit”) fin.

The melon-headed whale was first classified as member of the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;, but was later moved to its own genus, &quot;Peponocephala&quot;.

<text>Gaebler Children&#x27;s Center was a psychiatric institution operated by the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health for severely mentally ill children and adolescents, located in Waltham, Massachusetts.

The center opened on October 8, 1955, near the grounds of the Metropolitan State Hospital and closed in September 1992. It was named after William C. Gaebler, the second superintendent of the Metropolitan State Hospital. The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH) closed the center as it was antiquated and could no longer serve the needs of the children it housed. According to the DMH, this closure coincided with the decision to place mentally ill children in community settings instead of in institutional settings. Others felt the center was closed due to budget cuts.

According to the Waltham Land Trust and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the grounds of the Gaebler Center are currently being considered for redevelopment. (The Gaebler Center is now slated for Demolition with bids to be received prior to April 15, 2010)

Demolition and site development contractor Testa Corp won the bid to begin destruction of the area, as indicated by a sign recently erected at the entrance.

Mayor Jeanette McCarthy said the building was bought by the city of Waltham in 2005 in order to have some control over the development of the seven-acre site. Demolition of the Gaebler Children&#x27;s Center was completed in January 2011. The work cost the City of Waltham approximately $637,000. There are no current plans for the 55-acre lot.

<text>The Division of Werriwa is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The name Werriwa derives from a local Aboriginal name for Lake George, which was located in the division when it was established in 1900. The division was one of the original 65 divisions first contested at the first federal election.

Werriwa now covers an area in south-west Sydney, including the suburbs of Ashcroft, Austral, Bonnyrigg Heights, Bradfield, Busby, Carnes Hill, Cartwright, Casula, Cecil Hills, Edmondson Park, Glenfield, Green Valley, Heckenberg, Hinchinbrook, Horningsea Park, Hoxton Park, Long Point, Lurnea, Macquarie Fields, Macquarie Links, Middleton Grange, Miller, Prestons, Sadleir, and West Hoxton; as well as parts of Badgerys Creek, Bonnyrigg, Bringelly, Cecil Park, Denham Court, Ingleburn, Kemps Creek, Leppington, Mount Pritchard, and Rossmore.

The current Member for Werriwa, since the 2016 federal election, is Anne Stanley, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

Originally, Werriwa was a large and mostly rural electorate that stretched from south-west Sydney to the northern part of what is now the ACT, and included the Southern Highlands, Goulburn, and part of the South West Slopes. In succeeding years, with demographic change and electoral redistributions, Werriwa began to shrink and, from 1913 onwards, no longer included Lake George. It underwent several other major changes to its borders over the years. The 1949 expansion of Parliament saw Werriwa lose most of its remaining rural territory to the newly created Division of Macarthur and move to approximately its current position in south-west Sydney, over away from Lake George. However, it has retained the name of Werriwa, primarily as it is an original Federation electorate—the Australian Electoral Commission&#x27;s guidelines on electoral redistributions require it to preserve the names of original Federation electorates where possible.

It is a very safe seat for Labor, which has held it continuously since 1934 and for all but nine years since 1906.

Werriwa is best remembered for being the electorate of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who held it from 1952 to 1978. It was represented from 1994 to 2005 by one of Whitlam&#x27;s former aides, Mark Latham, the leader of the ALP and Leader of the Opposition from 2003 to 2005. In more recent times, a by-election in March 2005 resulted in Labor&#x27;s Chris Hayes elected with over 55% of the vote, in a 16-candidate race which saw no other candidate poll above 8%.

== Demographics ==
Werriwa is a heavily working class electorate and is considered part of Labor&#x27;s Western Sydney &quot;Red Wall&quot; (seats that are reliably safe for Labor).

Werriwa is home to relatively large immigrant communities. According to the 2016 census, 64.8% of electors had both parents born outside of Australia. 40.0% of people only speak English at home. Other languages spoken at home include Arabic 10.1%, Vietnamese 6.3%, Hindi 4.3%, Spanish 2.8% and Italian 2.2%.

<doc id="437016" wikidata="Q317044" url="?curid=437016" title="Andalusi Romance">
<text>Andalusi Romance, also called Mozarabic, refers to the varieties of Ibero-Romance that were spoken in Al-Andalus, the parts of the medieval Iberian Peninsula under Islamic control. Romance, or vernacular Late Latin, was the common tongue for the great majority of the Iberian population at the time of the Umayyad conquest in the early eighth century, but over the following centuries, it was gradually superseded by Andalusi Arabic as the main spoken language in the Muslim-controlled south. At the same time, as the northern Christian kingdoms pushed south into Al-Andalus, their respective Romance varieties (especially Castilian) gained ground at the expense of Andalusi Romance as well as Arabic. The final extinction of the former may be estimated to 1300 CE.

The medieval Ibero-Romance varieties were broadly similar (with Castilian standing out as an outlier). Andalusi Romance was distinguished from the others not by its linguistic features primarily, but rather by virtue of being written in the Arabic script. What is known or hypothesized about the particular linguistic features of Andalusi Romance is based on relatively sparse evidence, of which the &quot;kharjas&quot;, or closing lines of an Andalusi &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot; poem, are the most important.

==Names==
The traditional term for the Romance varieties used in al-Andalus is &quot;Mozarabic&quot;, derived from &quot;Mozarab&quot;, (from the ) a term used to refer to Arabized Christians in al-Andalus. In the context of medieval Iberia, the term is first documented in Christian sources from the 11th century; it was not used by Muslims to describe Christians.

Some scholars dislike the term for its ambiguity. According to Consuelo Lopez-Morillas:It has been objected that the term straddles ambiguously the realms of religion and language, and further implies, erroneously, that the dialect was spoken only by Christians. The very form of the word suggests (again a false perception) that it denotes a language somehow related to Arabic.To describe the varieties of Romance in al-Andalus, Spanish scholars are increasingly using (from the ), or Andalusi Romance in English.

Speakers of Andalusi Romance, like speakers of Romance anywhere else on the peninsula, would have described their spoken language simply as &quot;ladino&quot;, i.e. Latin. The term &quot;Ladino&quot; has since come to have the specialized sense of Judeo-Spanish. Arab writers used the terms or (, from , &#x27;non-Arab&#x27;) or &quot;Ajami&quot;.
== History ==
=== Umayyad conquest ===
Romance was the main language spoken by the population of Iberia when the Umayyads conquered Hispania in 711. Under Muslim rule, Arabic became a superstrate prestige language and would remain the dominant vehicle of literature, high culture, and intellectual expression in Iberia for five centuries (8th–13th).

Over the centuries, Arabic spread gradually in Al-Andalus, primarily through conversion to Islam. While Alvarus of Cordoba lamented in the 9th century that Christians were no longer using Latin, Richard Bulliet estimates that only 50% of the population of al-Andalus had converted to Islam by the death of Abd al-Rahman III in 961, and 80% by 1100. By about 1260, Muslim territories in Iberia were reduced to the Emirate of Granada, in which more than 90% of the population had converted to Islam and Arabic-Romance bilingualism seems to have disappeared.

== Archival record ==
What is known or hypothesized of the particular linguistic features of Andalusi Romance is based on relatively sparse evidence, including Romance topographical and personal names, legal documents from the Mozarabs of Toledo, names in botanical texts, occasional isolated romance words in the zajal poetry of Ibn Quzman, and Pedro de Alcalá&#x27;s &quot;Vocabulista&quot;.

=== The Kharjas ===
Samuel Miklos Stern&#x27;s rediscovery in the late 1940s of Romance present in some of the &quot;kharjas&quot;, the final verses in poetry otherwise written in Arabic and Hebrew, illuminated some morphological and syntactic features of Andalusi Romance, including sentence rhythms and phrasal patterns.

== Influences ==
Other than the obvious Arabic influence, and remnants of a pre-Roman substratum, early Mozarabic may also have been affected by African Romance, which would have been carried over to the Iberian Peninsula by the Berbers who made up most of the Islamic army that conquered it and remained prominent in the Andalusi administration and army for centuries to come. The possible interaction between these two Romance varieties has yet to be investigated.

==Language use==
Mozarabic was spoken by Mozarabs (Christians living as dhimmis), Muladis (natives converted to Islam), Jews, and possibly some of the ruling Arabs and Berbers. The cultural and literary language of the Mozarabs was at first Latin, but as time passed, it came to rather be Arabic, even among Christians.

Due to the continual emigration of Mozarabs to the Christian kingdoms of the north, Arabic toponyms are found even in places where Arab rule was ephemeral.

Mozarabic had a significant impact on the formation of Spanish, especially Andalusian Spanish, and served as a vehicle for the transmission of numerous Andalusi Arabic terms into both.

==Scripts==
Because Mozarabic was not a language of higher culture, such as Latin or Arabic, it had no standard writing system. Numerous Latin documents written by early Mozarabs are, however, extant.

The bulk of surviving material in Mozarabic is found in the choruses (or &quot;kharjas&quot;) of Andalusi lyrical compositions known as &quot;muwashshahs&quot;, which were otherwise written in Arabic. The script used to write the Mozarabic &quot;kharjas&quot; was invariably Arabic or Hebrew, less often the latter. This poses numerous problems for modern scholars attempting to interpret the underlying Mozarabic. Namely:

* Arabic script:
** did not reliably indicate vowels
** relied on diacritical points, quite often lost or distorted when copying manuscripts, to distinguish the following series of consonants: b-t-ṯ-n-y; ğ-ḥ-ḫ; d-ḏ; r-z; s-s̆; ṣ-ḍ; ṭ-ẓ; &#x27;-ġ; f-q; and h-a (word-finally)
** rendered the following consonants in similar ways: r-w-d, ḏ; &#x27;-l-k (word-initially); &#x27;, ġ-f, q-m (word-initially and medially); n-y (word-finally)
** had no specific means to indicate the following Romance sounds: /p, v (β), ts, dz, s̺, z̺, tʃ, ʎ, ɲ, e, o/
* Hebrew script:
** also did not reliably indicate vowels
** rendered the following consonants in similar ways: r-d; g-n; y-w; k-f; s-m (word-finally)

The overall effect of this, combined with the rampant textual corruption, is that modern scholars can freely substitute consonants and insert vowels to make sense of the &quot;kharjas&quot;, leading to considerable leeway, and hence inaccuracy, in interpretation.

==Phonological features==
It is widely agreed that Mozarabic had the following features:

* The diphthongs /au̯, ai̯/, the latter possibly changed to /ei̯/
* Diphthongization of stressed Latin /ŏ, ĕ/
* Palatalization and affrication of Latin /k/ before front vowels to /tʃ/
* Retention of Latin /j/ before front vowels
* Shift of the feminine plural /-as/ to /-es/

The following two features remain a matter of debate, largely due to the ambiguity of the Arabic script:

* Palatalization of Latin /nn, ll/ to /ɲ, ʎ/
* Lenition of intervocalic Latin /p t k s/ to /b d ɡ z/
** Much of the controversy over the voicing of Latin has centered on the Arabic letters Qāf and Ṭāʾ, which in fact had both voiced and voiceless pronunciations in different varieties of Arabic. It is likely that both pronunciations were found in the Iberian Peninsula.
** Ramón Menéndez Pidal has shown (sporadic) evidence of voicing in Latin inscriptions from the south of the Iberian Peninsula in the second century AD.
** There are a few cases of original Latin being represented with indisputably voiced consonants in Arabic, like , , and .

== Sample text ==
Presented below is one of the few &quot;kharjas&quot; whose interpretation is secure from beginning to end. It has been transcribed from a late thirteen-century copy in Hebrew script, but it is also attested (in rather poor condition) in an Arabic manuscript from the early twelfth century.

Another &quot;kharja&quot; is presented below, transcribed from Arabic script by García Gómez:

However the above &quot;kharja&quot;, like most others, presents numerous textual difficulties. Below is Jones&#x27;s transcription of it, with vowels inserted and uncertain readings italicized. Note the discrepancies.

<text>Heiner Goebbels (born 17 August 1952) is a German composer, conductor and professor at Justus-Liebig-University in Gießen and artistic director of the International Festival of the Arts Ruhrtriennale 2012–14. His composition &quot;Stifters Dinge&quot; (2007) received five votes in a 2017 &quot;Classic Voice&quot; poll of the greatest works of art music since 2000, and writers for &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked his composition &quot;Hashirigaki&quot; (2000) the ninth greatest classical composition of the same period.

== Biography ==
Goebbels was born in Neustadt an der Weinstraße. He studied sociology and music in Frankfurt am Main, and has composed for ensemble and for large orchestra. He has created several prize-winning radio plays, staged concerts, and, since the early 1990s, music theatre works, which have been invited to the most important theatre and music festivals worldwide.

Goebbels and Alfred Harth were musical partners in the Duo Goebbels/Harth (1975–1988) who co-founded the wind band Sogenanntes Linksradikales Blasorchester (1976–1981) and the avant-rock group Cassiber (1982–1992) with Alfred Harth, Chris Cutler and Christoph Anders. They toured extensively across Europe, Asia and North America, and made five albums. In October 1983 Cassiber (minus Anders) joined Duck and Cover, commissioned for the 1983 Moers Festival at the request of festival director Burkhard Hennen to Alfred Harth, followed by a performance at the Berlin Jazz Festival in West Berlin, and by another in February 1984 in East Berlin.

Some of his better-known work originated from his close collaboration with the East German writer Heiner Müller, resulting in stage compositions as well as shorter pieces (concerts as well as audio plays) based on Müller texts, such as &quot;Verkommenes Ufer&quot; (Waste Shore, 1984), &quot;Die Befreiung des Prometheus&quot; (The Liberation of Prometheus, 1985), or &quot;Wolokolamsker Chaussee&quot; (Volokolamsk Highway, 1989). Goebbels&#x27; attempts to fill the space between theatre and opera has led to projects such as &quot;Ou bien le débarquement désastreux&quot; (Paris 1993), &quot;Schwarz auf Weiss&quot; (Black on White, 1996) and &quot;Die Wiederholung&quot; (The Repetition, 1995). The political nature of his work is often referred to by critics. His interest in Heiner Müller can partly be explained by the political character of Müller&#x27;s texts, as may be the case with his interest in Bertolt Brecht and Hanns Eisler, works by the latter he used in composing his staged concert &quot;Eislermaterial&quot; (1998). 1998 he also created the music theatre play &quot;Max Black&quot; with words by Paul Valéry and others, in 2000 &quot;Hashirigaki&quot; after Gertrude Stein, 2002 his first opera &quot;Landscape with distant relatives&quot;, 2004 the prize winning &quot;Eraritjaritjaka&quot; with words by Elias Canetti, followed 2007 by the performative installation &quot;Stifters Dinge&quot; which has been performed more than 300 times in four continents. 2007 followed the staged concert &quot;Songs of Wars I have seen&quot; with words by Gertrude Stein – a commission by the London Sinfonietta and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, 2008 &quot;I went to the House but did not enter&quot; with the Hilliard Ensemble and words by Maurice Blanchot, Samuel Beckett a.o. In 2012 he created &quot;When the Mountain changed its clothing&quot; with the Choir Carmina Slovenica, and staged John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Europeras 1&amp;2&quot; in 2012 , Harry Partch&#x27;s &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot; in 2013 and Louis Andriessen&#x27;s De Materie for the Ruhrtriennale International Festival of the Arts.

Goebbels&#x27; work is being increasingly acknowledged as he is being played and staged around the world and as his recordings are being published. He collaborated with the finest ensembles and orchestras – Ensemble Modern, Ensemble InterContemporain, Ensemble musikFabrik, Asko/Schönberg, Berg Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic, Bochumer Symphoniker, Junge Deutsche Philharmonie, Brooklyn Philharmonic and many others and worked with conductors like Sir Simon Rattle, Péter Eötvös, Lothar Zagrosek, Peter Rundel, Steven Sloane and many others. In 2000 he collaborated with Piano Circus and composer Richard Harris to produce &quot;Scutigeras&quot;, which received a live BBC radio premiere in the UK. His &quot;Surrogate Cities&quot;, a work for big orchestra dating from 1994 and featuring texts from Paul Auster, Heiner Müller, and Hugo Hamilton, has been performed widely in Europe, the US and Australia and was nominated for a Grammy in the category Best Classical Contemporary Composition at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. His &quot;Eislermaterial&quot; won him another Grammy nomination at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004, this time in the category Best Small Ensemble Performance (with or without conductor).

His installative artwork &quot;Stifters Dinge – the Unguided Tour&quot; has been presented by Artangel in London (2012) and at the Ruhrtriennale in Duisburg (2013), &quot;Genko-An&quot; in Berlin (2008), Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony/Mathildenhöhe (2012), Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Lyon (2014) and Moscow&#x27;s NEW SPACE (2017). For the Centre Pompidou Paris he created the sound installations &quot;Fin de Soleil&quot; and &quot;Timée&quot;(2000) which was also exhibited at the ZKM Karlsruhe, the MACBA Barcelona, in Brugge and in Palazzo delle Esposizioni/Rome. He also closely collaborated on several video installations with visual artist Michal Rovner. 1982, 1987 and 1997 he participated with concerts, installative works and performing arts at the documenta in Kassel

Goebbels was a professor at Justus-Liebig-University in Gießen, Institute for Applied Theater Studies from 1999 until 2018, and teaches the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. From 2006 until 2018 he was President of the Theater Academy of Hesse. In recent years Goebbels enjoyed the privilege of several guest professorships and nominations for composer-in-residence., he is member of several academies of arts (Berlin, Bensheim, Düsseldorf, Mainz, Munich), Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Berlin, Honorable Fellow at the Dartington College of the Arts and the Central School of Speech and Drama, London. In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Birmingham City University, in 2018 by the National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts in Sofia (Bulgaria).

He received numerous awards and honours, such as Prix Italia, Europe Prize Theatrical Realities, and in 2012 the International Ibsen Award, one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious theatre awards, for bringing &quot;new artistic dimensions to the world of drama or theatre.&quot;.

In September 2010, it was announced that Goebbels was the artistic director designate for the 2012–14 seasons of the Ruhrtriennale.
 As artistic director of this Festival Heiner Goebbels curated, produced and presented several new works by the artists Robert Wilson, Romeo Castellucci, Michal Rovner, Boris Charmatz, Robert Lepage, Jan Lauwers, Ryoji Ikeda, Douglas Gordon, William Forsythe, Lemi Ponifasio, Mathilde Monnier, Saburo Teshigawara, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Rimini Protokoll, Tim Etchells, Gregor Schneider and many others.

His latest work, &quot;Everything that happened and would happen&quot;, was performed for the first time in October 2018 at Mayfield Depot in Manchester. It explores the history of Europe since World War I and combines live music, performance and film.

== Europe Theatre Prize ==
In 2001, he was awarded the Europe Prize Theatrical Realities, in Taormina, with the following motivation:Beginning in the mid-80s, Heiner Goebbels has managed to reinvent musical theatre. Composer, director, musical arranger and playwright all wrapped up into one, Goebbels has worked with actors, singers, musicians, writers, artists and set designers from all over the world. His &quot;Konzeptionelles Komponieren&quot;, constructed using Heiner Muller&#x27;s dialectic, Gertrude Stein&#x27;s audacious linguistic constructions, pop music and philosophical tracts, allow the spectator to see the music, hear the space and experience the text with polished simplicity. Acoustic and visual elements are not merely juxtaposed in their on-stage associations but linked together by a multiplicity of inter-relationships. To accomplish this, the divining rod of a sense of humor serves as a necessary tool in his search for their very essence. Goebbels is one of the most important representatives of international music and avant-garde theatre, with an evocative aesthetic that is simultaneously unmistakable and inexhaustible.
