<text>Grove City College (GCC) is a private, conservative Christian liberal arts college in Grove City, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1876 as a normal school, the college emphasizes a humanities core curriculum and offers 60 majors and six pre-professional programs with undergraduate degrees in the liberal arts, sciences, business, education, engineering, and music. The college has always been formally non-denominational, but in its first few decades its students and faculty were dominated by members of the Presbyterian Church, to the extent that it was sometimes described as having a &quot;de facto&quot; Presbyterian affiliation; in more recent decades, it and the Presbyterian Church have moved apart.

==History==
===Founding===
Founded in 1876 by Isaac C. Ketler, the school was originally chartered as Pine Grove Normal Academy. It had twenty-six students in its first year. In 1884, the trustees of Pine Grove Normal Academy in Grove City amended the academy charter to change the name to Grove City College. By charter, the doors of the College were open to qualified students &quot;without regard to religious test or belief.&quot; Isaac Ketler served as president until 1913.

Grove City was also supported by Joseph Newton Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Company. Pew and Ketler&#x27;s sons, Weir C. Ketler and John Howard Pew, later went on to become Grove City president and president of the board of trustees, respectively. During the summer of 1925, J. Gresham Machen gave the lectures that formed the basis of his book, &quot;What Is Faith?&quot;

===World War II===
As World War II began, Grove City College was one of six schools selected by the United States Navy to participate in the highly unusual Electronics Training Program (ETP). Starting in March 1942, each month a new group of 100 Navy and Marine students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. ETP admission required passing the Eddy Test, one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years. Professor Russell P. Smith was the program&#x27;s Director of Instruction. By the fall of 1943, there were only 81 civilian men in the student body; thus, the presence of 300 or so servicemen contributed greatly to sustaining the College. This training at Grove City continued until April 1945; library records show that 49 classes were graduating 3,759 persons.

===Supreme Court case===
Under President Charles S. MacKenzie, the college was the plaintiff-appellee in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in 1984, &quot;Grove City College v. Bell&quot;. The ruling came seven years after the school refused to sign a Title IX compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even ones not yet issued. The court ruled 6–3 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants fell under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but it limited the application to the school&#x27;s financial aid department.

In 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements. In response, Grove City College withdrew from the Pell Grant program entirely beginning with the 1988–1989 academic year, replacing such grants to students with its own program, the Student Freedom Fund. In October 1996, the college withdrew from the Stafford Loan program, providing entering students with replacements through a program with PNC Bank.

Grove City is one of a handful of colleges (along with Hillsdale College, which did likewise after the aforementioned 1984 case) that does not allow its students to accept federal financial aid of any kind, including grants, loans, and scholarships.

===Recent history===
From 1963 until 2016, the American Association of University Professors placed Grove City under censure for violations of tenure and academic freedom because of the dismissal of Professor of History and Political Science Larry Gara, at the direct behest of the then Chairman of the Board, J. Howard Pews. By the end of this period, Grove City&#x27;s administration was on the AAUP&#x27;s list of censured administrations longer than any other college on the list. In its report, the AAUP Investigative Committee at Grove City concluded that &quot;the absence of due process [in the dismissal of professors at Grove City] raises... doubts regarding the academic security of any persons who may hold an appointment at Grove City College under existing administrative practice. These doubts are of an order of magnitude which obliges us to report them to the academic profession at large.&quot; In 2013 Grove City started working to remove itself from the censure list. Two years later, the school admitted that they would have handled Gara&#x27;s case rather differently under their current procedures. This led the AAUP to lift its sanction on the school at its annual meeting in 2016. Gara received an apology from the school in October 2015.

In 2005, Grove City founded the conservative think-tank the Center for Vision and Values In April 2019, it was renamed the Institute for Faith &amp; Freedom, saying that it &quot;more clearly aligns it with the historic values of the College.&quot;

In recent years, the college has engaged in many new construction projects, including an expansion to its music and arts center in 2002, a new academic building in 2003, a new student union/bookstore in 2004, and new apartment-style housing in 2006. Grove City&#x27;s Student Union building was honored with the International Masonry Institute&#x27;s Golden Trowel Grand Prize for excellence in masonry design and construction in 2005. On February 9, 2011, Grove City College announced that it would break ground for construction of a science, engineering, and mathematics building – key components of Grove City Matters: A Campaign to Advance Grove City College, which at $90 million is the largest capital campaign in the college&#x27;s history. The $37.2 million science, engineering, and mathematics building is designed to support new modes of teaching, particularly flexible laboratories and small-group interactions. &quot;It will help ensure that Grove City College continues to prepare students for future careers in an increasingly competitive workforce&quot;, officials said. STEM Hall was opened in August 2013 and provides laboratory space for students studying biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science. In the summer of 2021, Grove City announced that the campus&#x27; Henry Buhl Library would be majorly renovated, with the addition of classroom space, updated study areas, and a cafe.

The college acquired an observatory from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania in February 2008 that will be used for astronomy classes as well as faculty and student research. The observatory&#x27;s telescope will be operated remotely, from the college&#x27;s main campus – more than away. The purchase of the property, three buildings, and equipment inside will pave the way for the addition of an astronomy minor on campus. Through this observatory, the college&#x27;s physics department plans to work with area public schools as well as other colleges and universities on educational and research projects and draw prospective students who are looking for strong physics programs and astronomy coursework.

==Academics==
Grove City offers 55 majors in the liberal arts, sciences, and engineering. The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The college&#x27;s electrical and computer and mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET). Most recently, the Bachelor of Science in Social Work program was approved as a candidate for accreditation through the specialized accreditation offered through the Council on Social Work Education. In 2019, Grove City announced a new partnership with Butler County Community College to provide a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree.

Many students choose Grove City explicitly for its Christian environment and traditional Humanities curriculum. A three-year required Humanities sequence focuses on the origin, development, and implications of civilization&#x27;s seminal ideas and worldviews. The courses cover content that includes religion, philosophy, history and philosophy of science, literature, art and music. Because of its strong adherence to freedom and minimal government interference, Grove City College is considered to be one of America&#x27;s foremost colleges that teach the ideas of the Austrian School of Economics. The post-1938 personal papers of Ludwig Von Mises, are housed in the archive of Grove City College. Grove City College also hosts the Austrian Student Scholars Conference. Annually done in February, a collection of students from around the United States present research papers on the history of economic thought or on current developments within the Austrian School of Thought. In addition to traditional business programs, Grove City also offers a degree in Entrepreneurship and a degree in Business Economics.

===Reputation and rankings===
Grove City College was ranked 225 of 498 in 2023 Forbes list of Top Colleges, and 4 of 41 in their Region in 2024 U.S. News &amp; World Report Rankings.
===Think tanks===
Although it is a small liberal arts college, Grove City&#x27;s faculty and administrators significantly influence and impact the ideas of various think tanks around the USA, especially on issues involving the environment, education, minimum wage, and other issues economic and conservative. Grove City College has international ties, founded in 1955, and on the International Society for Individual Liberty (ISIL) Freedom Network.

The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise an organization that seeks to provide effective community and faith-based organizations with training and technical assistance, links them to sources of support, and evaluates their experience for public policy to address the problems of youth violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, homelessness, joblessness, poor education, and deteriorating neighborhoods, publicizes events held at Grove City College.

The Lone Mountain Coalition, part of the Property and Environment Research Center, which claims to be &quot;America&#x27;s oldest and largest institute dedicated to original research that brings market principles to resolving environmental problems&quot;, has ties to Grove City through Michael Coulter, Vice-President of the Shenango Institute for Public Policy, and associate professor of political science at Grove City College.

Several members of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, a libertarian academic organization, are also faculty at Grove City.

Grove City also has ties to Michigan through Lawrence W. (Larry) Reed, president of Michigan&#x27;s Mackinac Center for Public Policy. Reed received his B.A. in Economics from Grove City in 1975. Reed is also past president of the State Policy Network.

The Academic Advisory Committee of the John Locke Foundation, a free market think tank in North Carolina, which supports the John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy, a nonprofit institute dedicated to improving higher education in North Carolina and the nation, includes Walter E. Williams, the John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics, George Mason University, holder of a Doctor of Humane Letters from Grove City College and John Moore, Former President of Grove City College, who led the college through its withdrawal from federal student loan programs, which completed the college&#x27;s break from federal ties.

===Policies and environment===
When it opened, Grove City College was one of the first institutions of higher learning in the United States to admit both male and female students. The school maintains a one-to-one ratio of men to women, ensuring that the student body is approximately 50% men and 50% women.

Grove City College adopts a strong policy regarding alcohol use on campus, with first-time offenders receiving a one-week suspension from all activities. Legal-age students are permitted to consume alcohol off campus, provided that they do not appear inebriated upon their return. Student organizations must agree to a strong policy regarding alcohol use both on and off campus, and their violation resulting in the loss of their charter.

In 2012, The Princeton Review listed Grove City College as the 2nd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States. In 2013 Grove City was at #1 in the Princeton Review’s rankings of most LGBT-unfriendly schools in America. As of 2016, they were ranked 9th.

By refusing to accept federal funds and Title IV financial aid (from the Higher Education Act of 1965), Grove City is not required to adhere to various federal guidelines that (i) prevent sex-based and many other forms of discrimination (e.g., Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972), (ii) regulate investigations into accusations of sexual abuse, (iii) require the collecting and sharing of information about crimes on campus (Clery Act), and (iv) set standards for disciplinary proceedings (Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act).

===Religious facilities===
Grove City College has always been officially non-denominational, but in its first decades had a &quot;de facto&quot; affiliation with the Presbyterian Church; today, it is no longer tied to a particular Christian denomination. The Department of Biblical &amp; Religious Studies is composed of confessionally Reformed professors from various denominational backgrounds. Students are required to attend a certain number of chapel services per semester. That was also the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Harbison Chapel has been a longstanding campus facility for Christian services. In 2012, Rathburn Hall was built to function as an office space for chapel staff, meeting space for religious groups, and a lounge area for visiting speakers.

==Groups and organizations==
GCC hosts approximately 150 Student Organizations and Activities.

===Publications and media===

<doc id="437042" wikidata="Q2276079" url="?curid=437042" title="Corner Gas">
<text>Corner Gas is a Canadian television sitcom created by Brent Butt. The series ran for six seasons from 2004 to 2009. Reruns still air on CTV, CTV2, CTV Comedy Channel, Much, MTV, E! and are streaming on Crave and Amazon Prime. The series was followed by a feature film titled &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot;, with the entire cast reprising their roles. The film was released for a limited theatrical run in December 2014.

Deriving its name from the roadside gas station in the fictional town of Dog River, Saskatchewan, Corner Gas is the only gas station for in any direction. Brent Leroy (Butt) is the proprietor of the station, which was formerly owned by his father, Oscar (Eric Peterson). Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) works at the station&#x27;s convenience store as a retail assistant. An adjoining coffee shop, The Ruby, is owned by Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller), who inherited it from her Aunt Ruby.

The series completed its run following broadcast of its sixth season on April 13, 2009, with a total of 107 episodes. The show averaged one million viewers per episode. &quot;Corner Gas&quot; received six Gemini Awards, and was nominated almost 70 times for various awards.

On April 6, 2009, Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall signed a proclamation that declared April 13, 2009, &quot;&quot;Corner Gas&quot; Day&quot; in Saskatchewan.

Production of an animated adaptation, &quot;Corner Gas Animated&quot;, was announced in December 2016, and premiered on The Comedy Network on April 2, 2018, featuring the complete original cast voicing their original characters, save for Janet Wright, who died in November 2016, the month prior to announcement. The role of Emma is voiced in the animated version by Corrine Koslo.

==Production==
===Concept===
The series was created by Canadian comedian Brent Butt, who imagined what his life might be like had he remained in a small Saskatchewan town rather than pursuing stand-up comedy. He originally developed the storyline for CTV and The Comedy Network.

&quot;Corner Gas&quot; references many tropes about Canadian identity, often ironically. The show focuses on the lifestyle of small-town folk; though set in a small town in Saskatchewan, its stories are not chiefly about Saskatchewan or Canada, but rather the day-to-day interactions of the residents of Dog River.

===Executive producers, directors, and co-producers===
&quot;Corner Gas&quot; was produced by CTV and Prairie Pants Productions. Prairie Pants Productions is a company assembled by Brent Butt, Virginia Thompson and 335 Productions. 335 Productions is a partnership between Brent Butt and David Storey. (The name of the production company is derived from the fact that Tisdale, Saskatchewan, Butt&#x27;s hometown, lies at the junction of Saskatchewan Highways 3 and 35.) At The Comedy Network, Michelle Daly is Director of Content and Ed Robinson is the President and General Manager. At CTV Inc., Susanne Boyce is President, Creative, Content and Channels and again Ed Robinson is Executive Vice-president, Programming. Brent Butt was a driving force as creator, writer, showrunner, executive producer, actor and, occasionally, director of the show. Paul Mather, Mark Farrell, Brent Butt, Andrew Carr, Kevin White, Robert Sheridan, Norm Hiscock, Dylan &quot;Worts&quot; Wertz and Gary Pearson all contributed to writing the series. David Storey, Mark Farrell, Robert de Lint, Jeff Beesley and Brent Butt provided direction in the program.

&quot;Corner Gas&quot; was promoted by CTV as the network&#x27;s &quot;first original narrative comedy series.&quot; While it is not, in fact, the first Canadian-produced sitcom ever aired on CTV, having been preceded by &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot;, &quot;George&quot;, &quot;Snow Job&quot;, &quot;Excuse My French&quot;, and &quot;Check It Out!&quot;, it is the first CTV sitcom in which the network itself has held a primary production role, rather than acting solely as a holder of broadcast rights, and the first to postdate the network&#x27;s late-1990s corporate restructuring from a cooperative of its affiliated stations into a conventional corporation. &quot;Corner Gas&quot; can also be verifiably called the most successful of these shows.

===Filming locations===
&quot;Corner Gas&quot; was filmed entirely in Saskatchewan. The interior shots (Ruby Café interior, Police Department, Oscar and Emma&#x27;s house, etc.) were filmed at Canada Saskatchewan Production Studios in Regina. All the outdoor scenes and all scenes that take place in the gas station were filmed on location in Rouleau, a small town on Highway 39 between Moose Jaw and Weyburn. The grain elevator was repainted to read &quot;Dog River&quot; instead of &quot;Rouleau&quot;; however, the water tower still reads &quot;Rouleau&quot;with post production effects used to repaint it to read &quot;Dog River&quot; in the first-season episode &quot;Grad 68&quot;. Regina is known as &quot;the city&quot; in &quot;Corner Gas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;escape/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28September 2014, the building that was used as the FOO[D] MAR[KE]T, the local grocery store, was destroyed in a fire.

On 4November 2016, the set that was used for both Corner Gas and the Ruby was demolished due to the foundations sinking. The structures, erected in 2003 as set pieces, were originally built on boggy land and were not initially built to last very long. In the intervening years, they had become a tourist attraction.

In summer 2021, the police station building collapsed, and the debris was removed. On 5November 2021, the grain elevator burned to the ground.

===Episode format===
Each episode of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; is written following a specific formula: two or three (almost always three, once four) storylines are presented in each show. The main storyline usually opens and closes the episode and is most of the time driven by a single character. The secondary plots are sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories.

===Opening sequence===
The &quot;Corner Gas&quot; opening sequence follows a cold open. The opening theme music, &quot;Not a Lot Goin&#x27; On&quot;, was written by Craig Northey of the rock band Odds and Jesse Valenzuela of the rock band Gin Blossoms, while the closing theme, &quot;My Happy Place&quot; was written by Northey and performed by Odds.

==Overview==
Corner Gas is the only gas station for in any direction (according to the first two episodes of season one, &quot;Ruby Reborn&quot; and &quot;Tax Man&quot;). Brent Leroy (Brent Butt) is the proprietor of the station and Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) works at the station&#x27;s convenience store as a retail assistant. An adjoining diner, The Ruby, is owned by Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller), who inherited it from her Aunt Ruby and moved to Dog River from Toronto. Brent&#x27;s parents, Oscar Leroy (Eric Peterson) and Emma Leroy (Janet Wright), are lifetime residents of Dog River. Dog River&#x27;s police force, consisting entirely of veteran Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal) and rookie Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn), keep the peace in the small town—a very simple task—and the officers have an overabundance of free time. Finally, Brent&#x27;s best friend Richard Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Yarbo (Fred Ewanuick), who is constantly unemployed, spends his time hanging out with Dog River&#x27;s residents and drinking coffee, for which he rarely pays, at The Ruby.

The first episode of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; aired on January 22, 2004, and attracted 1.5 million viewers. The first season consisted of 13 episodes. Less than two months after the first episode aired, CTV renewed it for a second season of 18 episodes.

Butt&#x27;s main co-writers were &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; writers Mark Farrell, Paul Mather, Kevin White, and Andrew Carr.

As broadcast of the fourth-season finale approached, there was a flurry of news reports suggesting that the series was coming to an unexpected end, based upon televised promotions for the episode, leaked plot details, and wording of a CTV press release issued on March 6, 2007, that implied that the series finale would air on March 12, 2007. Two segments of production footage with time code circulated on YouTube also seemed to indicate a series finale as imminent despite the show&#x27;s continued success in Canada and recent U.S. sale. On March 7, 2007, CTV clarified its press release, stating it was a season finale, and on March 13, 2007, CTV confirmed an order for a 19-episode fifth season, which premiered on September 24, 2007.

On April 10, 2008, as production of the sixth season began, Butt announced via a press release that he and his production company, Prairie Pants, had decided to conclude production of the series after the sixth season, with the final episodes airing in the spring of 2009. Butt said the decision to end the series while still a popular offering on CTV was &quot;a very difficult decision ... and one I felt I had to make. (CTV) made it clear that they were keen to do more seasons ... I wanted to exit gracefully, on top of our game.&quot;

The show&#x27;s final episode aired on April 13, 2009, airing in simulcast on CTV, The Comedy Network, and A. The episode attracted 2,914,000 viewers on terrestrial television and an additional 235,000 on The Comedy Network, for a total viewership of 3,114,000.

==Characters==
The surnames of all of the main characters and some recurring characters on the show (except for Mayor &#x27;Fitzy&#x27; Fitzgerald) are names of small towns in Saskatchewan; Burrows, Dollard, Humboldt, Jansen (Jensen), Kinistino, Leroy, Pelly, Quinton, Runciman and Yarbo.

===Main cast===
*Brent Herbert Leroy (Brent Butt) is the comic book-reading, sarcastic proprietor of Corner Gas. He is almost always good-natured, but has a tendency to fixate on minor details. He is a fan of adventure fiction such as &quot;The Saint in New York&quot; and &quot;The Executioner&quot;. His favourite food is chili cheese dogs, to the point where he can identify the individual ingredients by taste. Brent is &#x27;adept&#x27; at many sports, such as curling, hockey, and softball. His favourite football teams are the Saskatchewan Roughriders and Minnesota Vikings. He and Hank have been best friends since childhood, and Brent often makes fun of him and name multiple instances of Hank&#x27;s stupidity. As of the Season 5 finale, Brent is 40 years old, and was born on November 6 (thus, his date of birth can be assumed to be November 6, 1967, since Brent graduated high school in 1986). Brent is said to be the hottest guy in Dog River, although other characters on the show acknowledge this is faint praise. He is also the Dog River Table Hockey Champion using a &quot;dump it into the corners&quot; style of play. It is implied that he and Lacey Burrows have feelings for each other, although neither will admit or act upon them. After the end of the series he went on to fulfill his dream of fly-fishing in the Yukon, while looking to wrestle a bear (he didn&#x27;t find any bears, but he did see either a Sasquatch or an oddly shaped stump). It was revealed in &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot; that he and Lacey entered into a romantic relationship three years after the end of the series.
*Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller) took over the previously unnamed coffee shop in Dog River after her aunt&#x27;s death and renamed it The Ruby in her honour. Originally from Toronto, she is perpetually trying to fit into small-town life, with mixed, often disastrous, results. She is a terrible liar, quick to jump to conclusions, a poor winner, and thinks everybody has a crush on her, and frequently exhibits insecurity and regret about the path her life has taken. She has also expressed frustration at being unable to find &quot;a stable guy&quot; to date in Dog River. She considers herself a sweetheart and secretly believes that she alone of the town&#x27;s women deserves the &quot;Woman of Distinction&quot; award (which she eventually wins). She is also very knowledgeable when it comes to hockey, coaching Dog River&#x27;s hockey team, the Dog River Riverdogs. It is implied that she and Brent Leroy have feelings for each other, although neither will admit or act upon them. In season five Karen describes Lacey as &quot;too upbeat, overly fastidious, a little needysame old Lacey!&quot;. Her fashion sense trends toward the revealing. This was mocked in the episode &quot;Doc Small&quot;, in which she welcomes to Dog River Dr. Chris Garner, a doctor from an even smaller town, and she&#x27;s shocked by Lacey&#x27;s &quot;slutty&quot; top, which is actually one of her more conservative tops. After the series&#x27; end she opened a second Ruby in Wullerton, but the local health inspectors quickly shut it down. It was revealed in &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot; that she and Brent entered into a romantic relationship three years after the end of the series.
*Richard Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Yarbo (Fred Ewanuick) is Brent&#x27;s perpetually unemployed best friend. He often hangs out at Corner Gas talking to Brent and constantly borrows money from other characters and rarely pays them back. He has worked at a range of jobs, from census worker to crossing guard to city accountant, never being able to hold down or stay focused in one for long. He expressed a goal of working as a rodeo clown. His mother lives in Saskatoon, and his favourite foods are grape Pop Rocks and pickles (despite accidentally choking on the same pickle two times). Hank is quite childish, doing such things as going to see an adventure movie designed for six-year-olds four times in one week. He is shown to have a lot of interest in the CFL, most notably the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Saskatchewan&#x27;s football team. In a Christmas-themed episode, it is revealed that as a hockey fan, he likes the Vancouver Canucks. Despite his village-idiot routine, Hank actually has experience in many physical and maintenance activities, including auto mechanics, gardening, knitting, woodworking, and plumbing, making him something of a jack-of-all-trades. After the series, he continued to remain &quot;awesomely&quot; unemployed.
*Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) is a quirky cashier at Corner Gas, and the self-professed smartest person in town. She was born on April 16, 1968 (as shown on her driver&#x27;s license in the episode &quot;The Accidental Cleanist&quot;). Wanda has a sardonic, caustic personality and enjoys lording her knowledge over others. She is the single mother of a six-year-old son, Tanner Vincent Dollard, who is seen on-screen only briefly in the episode &quot;Oh Baby.&quot; (It&#x27;s implied that Hank is Tanner&#x27;s father; when Wanda is approached about this, she tries to laugh it off, but doesn&#x27;t deny it outright.) Tanner is portrayed as a living nightmare for prospective babysitters (Season 1, Episode 4) and is a handful for his own mother, doing things like putting peanut butter up her nose while she sleeps. Accused of being a know-it-all, Wanda is also one of very few Dog River residents who has gone to university; she holds a degree in linguistics with a minor in comparative religion but took classes in many other subjects. Despite her extensive education, she considers her job at Corner Gas a privilege. She is shown as having a case of mild agoraphobia in one episode. Like Brent and Hank, Wanda grew up in Dog River. After the end of the series, she pursued a PhD in theoretical physics though she still works at Corner Gas, albeit with a pay raise.
*Oscar Leroy (Eric Peterson) is Brent&#x27;s grouchy, stubborn, elderly-stereotype father, the retired former owner and founder of Corner Gas. His all-purpose word is &quot;jackass&quot;; during the course of the live-action series, he says it ninety times. (It is also the series&#x27;s final spoken word.) He often demands that the Dog River police arrest everyone who annoys him. He frequently, belligerently, points out to government workers: &quot;My taxes pay your salary!&quot; He tends to exclaim &quot;Holy hell!&quot; on encountering new or surprising things. He rivals Hank in his brain capacity and ability to make mistakes and the two are often shown scheming together. Oscar likes to show his handiwork around the house, but usually makes things worse when he tries to fix things. When Brent suggested selling Corner Gas to a huge company, Oscar replied &quot;How dare you – how dare you keep the Pump and Go people waiting, sell it, sell it now!&quot;, showing he didn&#x27;t love his old job. This, however, was only part of Hank&#x27;s fantasy sequence, and may not accurately reflect Oscar&#x27;s actual sentiment.
*Emma Leroy (Janet Wright) is Brent&#x27;s mother, the brains and muscle of the family. She and Oscar squabble constantly and she usually ends up having to deal with the fallout from his actions, which she usually makes worse. Though he embarrasses and annoys her, she does truly love him. She has also found &quot;letting go&quot; of Brent difficult and reacts badly when someone else appears to replace her in some aspect of his life. Her main hobbies are knitting, crocheting, and gardening and she is active in many of the town&#x27;s committees. She has also been shown to possess great strength (being able to hurl a cinder block at a skunk across the yard with little effort), and other characters often seek her advice. She has a quick-tempered, cunning, domineering personality. After the end of the series she remained married to Oscar, despite doctor&#x27;s orders.
*Sergeant Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal) is Dog River&#x27;s overly sensitive First Nations Cree senior police officer. He has a habit of misspending the police budget, napping on the job, and making up the laws as he goes along, having never actually read the police manual. Due to the low crime rate in Dog River, he does not take his job very seriously. He is obsessed with &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, retro-TV and classic cartoon shows; and is a science fiction aficionado. He believes that the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; may have really happened. His catchphrase is an enthusiastic &quot;All right!&quot; He is a fan of the Saskatchewan Prairie Fire (he is often seen wearing their gear while off duty). Davis once competed in rhythmic gymnastics; he also has a collection of the original &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; books. He is unable to make coffee, but is unwilling to tell anyone. When he was a baby his mother left him to join a band; for a long time he thought their cleaning lady was his mom. At the end of season 5, Davis is said to be 46 years old, which would make 1961 his year of birth. He was also seen as a police officer in Dog River in 1986 (the &quot;Grad &#x27;68&quot; episode in season 1). He lost his sense of smell after being hit on the head as a child, and regains it after falling from a ladder trying to rescue a cat from the Leroys&#x27; tree. Davis is divorced but after the end of the series he eventually remarried.
*Constable Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is Dog River&#x27;s ambitious, stickler for the rules junior police officer. Before becoming a police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada in the sport of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She&#x27;s a very good cook, but does not like to bring it up for fear it will stereotype her. She does not want to admit that she does not know how to ride a bike. She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it&#x27;s the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, he stares at her dumbfounded and asks &quot;Why?&quot; Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis&#x27; willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules. They differ greatly on their views of what a police officer should portray; on one occasion, Karen states that &quot;a police officer should be respected by the community&quot;, to which Davis casually replies &quot;Who said that?&quot; Many episodes see them engaged in petty disputes and going to great lengths to one-up each other. Despite their differences, Karen and Davis get along well although they don&#x27;t spend much time together outside of work. In the episode &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot; Karen goes fishing with Hank and is seduced by his &quot;sexy fish talk&quot;. After the end of the series, she falls in love and marries; in &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot;, Karen&#x27;s husband is said to be a soldier stationed off the Mediterranean coast, and they are expecting their first child.

===Recurring characters===
*Fitzy Fitzgerald (Cavan Cunningham) is the mayor of Dog River. He tends to take his position very seriously. He is quite paranoid about losing his job and thinks that anyone will do anything for the position of mayor, although no one really wants it. Little is revealed about his personal life; however, several episodes imply that he may have a son.
*Wes Humboldt (Mike O&#x27;Brien) owns and operates the liquor and insurance store in town. His father died saving his entire platoon in the Korean War, although everyone told him that he ran off to join the circus. Wes later learns the truth when Brent reads out a passage from a book detailing the history of Dog River, not knowing that Wes was not supposed to hear it.
*Paul Kinistino (Mark Dieter) is the bartender at the Dog River Hotel. He is a Cree man, and speaks a little bit of the Cree language. He went to high school with Brent, Wanda and Hank. In the episode &quot;Cell Phone&quot;, he replaces the shuffleboard game in the bar with a claw game, to which Oscar becomes addicted. In &quot;Friend of a Friend&quot;, he claims to have a master&#x27;s degree in history. In season four, Paul is replaced by a new bartender, Phil Kinistino (Erroll Kinistino), though it&#x27;s never revealed how they are related.
*Josh the Cook (Josh Strait) is the reserved chef at The Ruby. In &quot;Safety First&quot;, he temporarily quits his job and first speaks, telling Lacey he wants to become a llama farmer. When Lacey asked Brent if he was aware Josh wanted to work with llamas, Brent replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know he could talk.&quot; Josh Strait also hosted the tours of the Corner Gas set in Regina, Saskatchewan.
*Helen Jensen (Jean Freeman), the mayor&#x27;s grandmother, is also known as &quot;Fitzy&#x27;s Grandma&quot;. In the episode &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Thing&quot;, she is the one who innocently suggests Dog River build the &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Hoe&quot; to honour Dog River&#x27;s farming heritage. Brent disagrees but can&#x27;t bear to tell her about the inappropriate connotations of that phrase.
*Myrtle Runciman (Gwen Seed) is a batty elderly neighbour of Oscar and Emma&#x27;s who appears many times over the course of the show. She is a member of their curling team and in one episode is seen driving a large pickup truck. Often she is vague and senile, but she has been known to make pointed remarks about the other characters.

===Notable guest stars===
Several notable Canadian celebrities and politicians appeared as guest stars or in cameo roles on &quot;Corner Gas&quot;. Some celebrities made the trip to the Rouleau or Regina sets to film their appearances, others were filmed in the applicable locations (e.g., scenes involving cast members of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; and &quot;Canada AM&quot; were filmed at the respective programs&#x27; studios).

Two successive sitting prime ministers, Paul Martin and Stephen Harper, made cameo appearances; &quot;Corner Gas&quot; is the only fictional sitcom (as opposed to sketch comedy series) in which sitting prime ministers have appeared. Two successive sitting premiers of Saskatchewan, Lorne Calvert and Brad Wall, also appeared in episodes. &quot;Demolition&quot; features former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, taking a sledgehammer to an old barn. Ben Mulroney, host of TV shows &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; and &quot;eTalk Daily&quot; and the son of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, parodies himself during the third-season episode &quot;Dog River Vice&quot;.

Kevin McDonald of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; played Marvin Drey, a disliked Revenue Canada agent, in &quot;Tax Man&quot;, the second episode of the series. In the same episode Dan Matheson, a news anchor for CTV, appeared as himself. Julie Stewart played a paint store clerk (parodying her role in &quot;Cold Squad&quot;) in &quot;Grad 68&quot;. Comedian Mike Wilmot played Carl Vaughn, Brent&#x27;s snobby cousin. Colin Mochrie, a prolific Canadian comedy actor best known for his work in the British and American versions of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, made a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;Comedy Night&quot; as part of a joke about how he seems to turn up on every Canadian TV show. Pamela Wallin, former CBC newscaster, later Canadian Consul General and senator, a native of Wadena, Saskatchewan, played herself. &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; judges Sass Jordan, Zack Werner, Jake Gold, and Farley Flex appeared as themselves rating Brent&#x27;s rendition of &quot;It would never rain in Dog River ... If I Could Squeegee the Sky&quot; in the episode &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot;. TSN sportscaster (and &quot;U8TV: The Lofters&quot; alumnus) Jennifer Hedger and her &quot;SportsCentre&quot; colleague Darren Dutchyshen appeared as themselves in the episode &quot;Face Off&quot;.

The second season also attracted notable personalities. &quot;Wedding Card&quot; featured hockey star Darryl Sittler as himself. Pat Fiacco, then-mayor of Regina, appears in the episode &quot;Whataphobia&quot; as Stan, the owner of Dog River&#x27;s miniature golf course. &quot;Poor Brent&quot; has an appearance by long-time &quot;CTV National News&quot; anchor Lloyd Robertson, playing himself. Canadian and world champion curlers Randy Ferbey and Dave Nedohin (both of whom curl for Alberta) appear as themselves providing advice during the hotly contested Dog River curling championship, the Clavet Cup in episode &quot;Hurry Hard&quot;. The episode &quot;An American in Saskatchewan&quot; features Mark McKinney, a veteran of both &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as Bill, an American who visits Dog River by accident. Saskatchewan-born musician Colin James appears as a local musician (although it is implied that he&#x27;s actually playing himself) who performs an audition in Brent&#x27;s garage. The rock group The Tragically Hip appear as &quot;local kids&quot; who practise in Brent&#x27;s garage. The Tragically Hip play a rough version of &quot;It Can&#x27;t Be Nashville Every Night&quot; off their &quot;In Between Evolution&quot; album. Both The Tragically Hip and Colin James are in the episode &quot;Rock On!&quot;

Singer Jann Arden appears as herself in &quot;Fun Run&quot;. Noted actress Shirley Douglas (mother of Kiefer Sutherland, and daughter of Tommy Douglas, former Premier of Saskatchewan) plays a woman with the hots for Oscar in &quot;Trees a Crowd&quot;. Then-federal finance minister Ralph Goodale appears as a Ruby Café customer in &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;. (The episode debuted the same day Goodale filed a &quot;mini-budget&quot; in the House of Commons.) Lorne Calvert, premier of Saskatchewan, appears as himself. He appears three times: twice to poke fun at Sweden and once to almost get hit by a thrown newspaper during the appropriately named &quot;Ruby Newsday&quot;. Vicki Gabereau appears as herself during a fantasy sequence in the same episode. Prior to the debut of &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, the cast had appeared on Gabereau&#x27;s CTV talk show, during which Brent Butt promised to get the talk show host a guest appearance. &quot;Merry Gasmas&quot; features &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; anchor Gavin Crawford as a worker in the Calgary International Airport. He would always call cities their airport names (YYC, YEG) which confused Lacey horribly. In the same episode Dan Redican from &quot;The Frantics&quot;, and more recently &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;, makes an appearance as a worker in the Regina International Airport. He repeatedly says &quot;made that call.&quot; &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; star Roman Danylo makes a cameo as a passenger sitting next to Lacey on a plane from Alberta to Vancouver. He claims to be a &quot;cat doctor,&quot; and not a veterinarian. He manages to out-chat Lacey while talking about cats during the same episode. Ken Read, also known as &quot;The Crazy Canuck,&quot; is a champion alpine skier and member of the Canadian Olympic Committee. During episode &quot;Physical Credit&quot;, Read receives a browbeating from Oscar (which first aired the day after closing ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics).

Olympic long-track speed skater medal winner Cindy Klassen makes a cameo appearance in the fourth season episode &quot;Dog River Dave&quot;. Mike Holmes, the star of &quot;Holmes on Homes&quot;, helps to fix Oscar&#x27;s bathroom in the episode &quot;Jail House&quot;; Wanda claims to have dated the Holmes character. CTV CEO Ivan Fecan makes a cameo appearance during the episode &quot;Blog River&quot;. &quot;Gopher It&quot; featured then Prime Minister Stephen Harper as himself, stating that regardless of whether Dog River plans to commemorate prairie dogs or gophers, he appreciates both. &quot;Canada AM&quot; co-anchors Seamus O&#x27;Regan and Beverly Thomson appear, playing themselves. Unlike most cameos, O&#x27;Regan and Thomson appear extensively in this episode to parody their on-screen image. &quot;CTV National News&quot; reporter Rosemary Thompson appears, playing herself in a scrum with the Prime Minister at the gas station.

During the fifth season three episodes bring in notable personalities. In &quot;Coming Distractions&quot;, Duane &quot;Dog&quot; Chapman and Beth Smith from &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot; appear to arrest Brent during a fantasy sequence. In the episode &quot;Bed and Brake Fast&quot; hockey player Travis Moen makes a cameo appearance with the Stanley Cup. In &quot;Final Countdown&quot;, actor Kiefer Sutherland makes a cameo appearance. In the same episode, Shirley Douglas&#x27; voice is heard.

Michael Bublé appears in the sixth-season episode &quot;TV Free Dog River&quot;. He calls in (unseen at first) to Davis&#x27;s jazz radio program, requesting a song from Michael Bublé. After Davis says that &quot;Michael Bublé isn&#x27;t jazz&quot;, the camera cuts to the actual singer, who says sadly that he is &quot;a gifted vocalist who defies genres&quot;. In episode four of the sixth season, &quot;Meat Wave&quot;, Canadian science broadcaster and environmental activist David Suzuki also appears in a cameo.

==Setting==
===Dog River===
Dog River (Rouleau, Saskatchewan) has a population of &quot;about 500&quot; according to &quot;Census Sensibility&quot;. According to the &quot;Corner Gas&quot; tagline, it is from nowhere, but still within a relatively short drive to &quot;The City&quot;, where characters are often shown going to shop or attend &quot;support meetings&quot;, in the case of Davis and Lacey. The rival town of Wullerton is &quot;just down the road&quot;. It is stated in the episode &quot;Tax Man&quot; that Corner Gas is the only gas station for in any direction. Series creator Brent Butt has said the town lies somewhere between Regina and Saskatoon; these two cities are apart, so this fact does not contradict anything said on the series. In fact, the term &quot;the city&quot; has been used at various times in the series to refer to Regina. The third-season episode, &quot;Fun Run&quot; has one character drive to Weyburn for a lark, suggesting Dog River is probably closer to Regina than it is to Saskatoon. In the episode &quot;Outside Joke&quot;, when the Corner Gas station is believed to actually be outside the town limits, it is said to be in the fictional municipality of Pitt Creek. In &quot;Kid Stuff&quot;, Wanda says it is south of the also fictional Crowley Lake.

The town&#x27;s name is an &quot;homage&quot; to series creator Brent Butt&#x27;s hometown of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, through which the Doghide River flows. However, in the show itself, the second-season episode &quot;Rock On!&quot; revealed that the town was named after a great-great uncle of Lacey&#x27;s who drowned a dozen dogs in the river. She discovered this trivia while researching information for a history plaque. In order to play down this unsavoury branch of her family tree, Lacey instead used a story that Karen made up: that pioneers somehow got hold of a hot air balloon, got an aerial view of the town site, and noticed that the creek formed a shape similar to that of a dog&#x27;s leg. &quot;Block Party&quot; revealed that the town was founded in 1905, and its founder was a Mr. Harold Main after whom Main Street was named (it was later renamed Centennial Street in 2005, the origin of the name being forgotten). Main also constructed Dog River&#x27;s first building, a wooden shack which Hank Yarbo would burn down a century later in order to maintain the accuracy of his Lego scale model of the town (he ran out of blocks and could not make a replica of the shack).

A real-life Regina tour operator regularly takes busloads of tourists to Rouleau to visit &quot;Dog River&quot;. Visitors can tour the on-location sets of &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, including the service station. Many components of Dog River are, in fact, real attributes of Rouleau, notably the combined liquor and insurance store.

On February 9, 2010, Google Street View extended its coverage of Canada, including all streets within Rouleau. The remnants of the Corner Gas and Ruby standing sets, along with the grain elevator labelled &quot;Dog River&quot; are visible from ground level at the junction of Highways 39 and 714. The grain elevator, built in 1972, was destroyed by fire on November 5, 2021.

After falling into disrepair when the show ended, the Rouleau sets were purchased by businessman Sylvain Senecal and restored as a souvenir shop. The sets were open from May 1 until late September where Corner Gas, Saskatchewan and regular convenience store items could be purchased, and were later once again utilized for &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot;. However, by 2016, the Ruby and Corner Gas sets had once again fallen into disrepair and, due to being built on a bog, had begun to sink and were declared unsafe. On November 4, 2016, the buildings were demolished. Despite this, however, the town of Rouleau announced at the same time plans for a walking tour of surviving &quot;Corner Gas&quot; sets to launch in 2017, while the Western Development Museum branch in Moose Jaw announced plans to exhibit artifacts from the series, including the original Corner Gas sign.

===&quot;The Howler&quot;===
The town has its own newspaper, &quot;The Dog River Howler&quot; (usually just called &quot;The Howler&quot;), to which almost everybody has contributed at one point or another. Its headlines are usually rife with inaccurate, sensationalist reporting. An example of exaggeration can be seen in &quot;Hero Sandwich,&quot; in which a proposal to install traffic lights at a four-way intersection prompts the headline &quot;Crosswalk HELL—Mayor Insane.&quot; Another example occurs (mentioned in the same episode) when coyotes wander into town to eat cats, prompting the incorrectly spelled headline &quot;Cattle Killed by .&quot; An example of amusingly fabricated reporting can be seen in the first episode, in which a headline reads &quot;Moose Jaw Gets NBA Franchise,&quot; and at an unseen time, they declared that Canada was apparently at war with Switzerland. The paper is also rife with misspellings, for example in the third season that &quot;Hank is &quot; (the story was &quot;&quot; on page 30) or in the fourth season that &quot;Cop nabs thief&quot; (after Karen mentions that the arraigned person was &quot;barely a thief&quot; for having stolen a truck loaded with barley).

===Emergency services===
The &quot;Police Department,&quot; consisting of officers Davis and Karen, keeps the peace in Dog River.

In &quot;The Littlest Yarbo,&quot; a short-lived Fire Department consisting of two firefighters, David and Carol (both showing remarkable similarities to Davis and Karen, respectively), was established by the mayor when the volunteer fire chief decided to sleep in as opposed to responding to a fire. The volunteer system was reestablished after Hank, Davis, and Oscar lit an uncontrollable leaf fire and the fire department did not respond as they were chasing a stray dog (the same one Hank thought to be &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;). Fitzy saw Davis in the aftermath as the only first responder there and gave him the new title of Chief, Volunteer Fire Department.

The Dog River Police Department owns two police cars, both 1994 Ford Crown Victorias. In every episode save series premiere &quot;Ruby Reborn&quot; and &quot;Dark Circles,&quot; the police use only one of them.

===Wullerton rivalry===
The residents of Dog River have a pathological dislike of the residents of Wullerton, a neighbouring town, to the point that they spit on the ground whenever the rival town is mentioned, much to Lacey&#x27;s hygienic disapproval when such action takes place within her cafe. They are so used to doing so that they sometimes do not realize it when they spit (especially within said cafe). Dog River&#x27;s local newspaper, the Howler, will even print &quot;(SPIT)&quot; after printing the word &quot;Wullerton.&quot; However, the people of Wullerton may not hate Dog River, as seen in the fourth season&#x27;s finale. (However, this was only part of Hank&#x27;s fantasy sequence, and may not accurately reflect Wullerton&#x27;s actual sentiment towards Dog River). The reason for this antipathy was never explained. Publicity for the second season indicated that the season finale would reveal the reason for the spitting; however, the episode as broadcast did not actually do so. This practice of looking down on neighbouring towns is common in many prairie communities, primarily those in Saskatchewan and Alberta, such as Tisdale, Melfort, and Wilcox. Wullerton is first shown onscreen in &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot;, as for the reason Dog River residents hate it so much: Wullerton is a creepy, eerily &quot;Stepford Wives&quot;-ish town where everyone is excessively nice and clean-cut, which tends to scare any visitors from Dog River.

===Thunderface===
Thunderface is an in-universe fictional band that was formed in the mid-&#x27;80s by lead singer Hank Yarbo, lead guitar player Brent Leroy, and bass guitar player Wanda Dollard. In 2005, the band was expanded to include drummer Karen Pelly, the most competent musician in the group. (While filming, Fred Ewanuick did his own singing as Hank, Brent Butt played all his own guitar parts, and Nancy Robertson learned to play bass shortly before filming commenced. Only Tara Spencer-Nairn did not do her own playing for the episode.)

Thunderface has suffered from relative anonymity due to confusion with their name (as well as the fact that they have had only one gig since 1986). They have been referred to as &quot;Rumblepuss,&quot; &quot;Thunderbread,&quot; &quot;Thunderchunks,&quot; and &quot;Wonderface,&quot; among other names. Their sound is described as similar to &quot;a small animal caught in some kind of machinery,&quot; and their sole gig since 1986 was booked due to the humorous nature of their poor performance. Along with their gig in 1986, they seemed to have done some school performances considering they blew the principal&#x27;s eyebrows off. The only song they have been heard to play is &quot;Capital Cash&quot; by Fast Exit, a band that Brent Butt played guitar in before he got into comedy.

===The Surveillance Bush===
The Surveillance Bush (the only foliage on the otherwise tree-less prairie surrounding the town) is a bush that is seen only in the first episode and the last episode. Karen is seen parked behind it watching for speeders in the Police Cruiser in Ruby Reborn. Davis and Karen are also seen on the last episode hiding behind it before tailing Brent in the final episode. Since there was no wind a cast member was actually lying down shaking the bush. The bush was planted only for those two episodes.

==Broadcast and distribution==
===First-run broadcast===
In 2006, &quot;Corner Gas&quot; was the only Canadian-made top-20 TV show in all of Canada (other than a hockey telecast), the rest being U.S. imports. It first premiered in January 2004, outperforming all U.S. sitcoms among adults aged 25–54.

Since 2004, the series&#x27; production coincided with that of another CTV program, &quot;Robson Arms&quot; in which Gabrielle Miller and Fred Ewanuick also co-starred. Miller also had a recurring role in the series &quot;Alienated&quot; in 2004, giving her the rare distinction of playing major roles in three unrelated television series during the same calendar year (although &quot;Robson Arms&quot; had never been aired until 2005). As of fall 2007, two seasons of &quot;Robson Arms&quot; featuring Miller and Ewanuick have been produced and released to DVD.

Early in the run of &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; television critic Bill Brioux reported an unconfirmed rumour that it had been unsuccessfully pitched to CBC Television, which came to be cited as evidence that the public broadcaster was out of touch with Canadian audiences. This was later revealed to be untrue; The Comedy Network was in fact the first and only network to which the show was proposed.

Fred Ewanuick appeared as Hank on the &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;″s 300th episode in a spoof of &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, in which Yasir (Carlo Rota) and Sarah (Sheila McCarthy) from CBC&#x27;s &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; bought the gas station and fired Brent. Hank then debated with them the location of Mercy (the Saskatchewan town where &quot;Little Mosque&quot; takes place) in relation to Dog River.

===Live episode===
In summer 2006, the cast of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; presented a fund-raising benefit event for Regina&#x27;s Globe Theatre called &quot;Corner Gas...Live&quot;, in which the cast presented a live episode of the TV series. The popularity of the sitcom caused such a rush for tickets that the Globe Theatre&#x27;s online ticket sales system briefly went down as a result. Another benefit was held during the summer of 2007.

===U.S. broadcast===
On November 24, 2006, it was announced that &quot;Corner Gas&quot; would air on the U.S. WGN America beginning September 17, 2007. &quot;Corner Gas&quot; was syndicated to WGN America by Multi-Platform Distribution Company (MPDC), which acquired the U.S. distribution rights for broadcast stations and cable channels. The show was offered to cable networks such as WGN America on an all-cash basis; the show was also offered to local stations on cash-plus-barter basis, though it was unknown if any channels other than WGN America carried the series. The series was carried by WGN America during the 2008–2009 television season; it was not broadcast in Chicago on WGN-TV.

In an unusual case, WGN America picked up the fifth season&#x27;s episodes while they were airing contemporaneously on the show&#x27;s original network CTV. In most cases, new episodes normally take a year or more to air in another country.

On October 3, 2019, Amazon-owned IMDb announced that it would be exclusively streaming the entire &quot;Corner Gas&quot; franchise on their platform for free to US viewers beginning on October 15.

===DVD releases===
The first season was released on DVD in Canada on October 19, 2004. In keeping with the theme of the series, each DVD set included a coupon good for a free coffee at Petro-Canada service stations. At the Canadian Entertainment Network Awards, Season one DVD was honoured as &quot;Best Canadian DVD-English&quot;. The second season was released on DVD on September 27, 2005, and features the distinction of being one of the few regular TV series whose DVD box set includes described video for the visually impaired. The second-season set was released by CTV and Video Service Corporation and includes a peek at Season 3, bloopers, cast and crew interviews, a Thunderface music video as well as all of the season 2 episodes. The third-season DVD was released on October 3, 2006. Unlike the past sets, the third-season DVD set is presented in widescreen (letterboxed on 4:3 televisions, Windowboxed on widescreen TVs). The fourth season was released on DVD on September 18, 2007. From the fourth season forward, the episodes are presented in proper anamorphic widescreen. This was the first time the DVD set of the past season was released before the current season started airing; the set includes a series of &quot;Mobisodes&quot; which were short (approximately two minutes each) skits focusing on the main characters. Season 5 was released on DVD on October 7, 2008, and is presented in a &quot;bobblehead&quot; theme. Besides all of the 19 season 5 episodes, the set includes &quot;Corner Gas&quot; character commentaries, &quot;My Happy Place&quot; in a music video format and bloopers. Season 5 DVD set has enclosed a $10 discount coupon towards a &quot;Corner Gas&quot; mechanic shirt. Season 6 was released on June 9, 2009, two months after the series finale.

In Australia, only the first three series have been released. The cover art for the seasons differ from the Region 1 releases. The first two seasons having the group of the cast in front of the gas station which is in the distant background, while the third season has them in front of the grain silo. Unlike the Canadian release, the Australian version of Season 3 contains anamorphic widescreen versions of the episodes. Curiously, though, almost all of these episodes have never add any on-screen actor credits nor captions (such as the show&#x27;s writers/directors) over any of the live action, suggesting that perhaps the DVD company had to go back to the original film elements in order to get an anamorphic picture.

*Corner Gas – Series 2 (3 Disc Set) – July 14, 2009

==Complementary media==
===Comedy tour===
Brent Butt offered the eight-city &quot;Gassed Up&quot; tour beginning March 21, 2004. The $70,000 &quot;Great Canadian Gas Giveaway Tour&quot; began September 27, 2004. In late September 2004, to promote the start of the second season, the cast members of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; travelled to cities across Canada where they pumped gas at local service stations for the day (the fuel being provided to motorists free of charge). By the halfway point of the promotion, more than 40,000 litres of free gasoline had been pumped. The cast of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; crossed Canada visiting six cities in a comedy tour called &quot;CTV Presents Corner Gas Live!&quot; which began September 21, 2005. Eight Canadian radio stations broadcast the show live at the start of the fourth season.

===&quot;Comic Genius&quot;===
In 2005, &quot;Corner Gas&quot; partnered with The Comedy Network to host a contest called &quot;Comic Genius&quot;. The majority of episodes were broadcast online, with the one-hour finale broadcast live on The Comedy Network in February 2006. The winner, John Beuhler, won $10,000 and a guest appearance on the show.

===&quot;Corner Gas Online&quot;===
&quot;Corner Gas Online&quot; provides cast biographies, episode synopsis, bloopers, and a visit to Virtual Dog River. The Virtual Dog River features The Howler providing the latest news about the television series. There are online games available such as prairie scramble, combine racing and the perfect pump when visiting various locations in virtual Dog River. Oscar and Emma Leroy&#x27;s virtual home features &quot;Corner Gas&quot; bloopers. Visiting the Ruby will provide an online chat room. The virtual gas station is an online shop for licensed merchandise.
&quot;Corner Gas&quot; episodes can now be watched on demand on The CTV Video Player at CTV.ca and thecomedynetwork.ca.

===Licensed merchandise===
&quot;Corner Gas&quot; has spawned a merchandising business, with hundreds of retail items, sold-out live touring productions, and best-selling DVDs. A companion book to the show, called &quot;Tales from Dog River: The Complete Corner Gas Guide&quot;, was published on November 4, 2006. It was written by Toronto journalist Michele Sponagle and was produced in conjunction with CTV, Penguin Canada, and Prairie Pants Productions. The book debuted in the number two spot among new releases, behind only Vincent Lam&#x27;s Giller Prize-winning book &quot;Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures&quot;. On December 12, 2006, it was the top-selling non-fiction paperback in Canada, according to BookMarket data. It includes cast interviews, an episode guide, insider jokes, bloopers, best lines, a look at the real Dog River (Rouleau, Saskatchewan), and a chronology on how the show was created from inception to debut episode. Author Michele Sponagle went on a book tour to cities across Canada, including Ottawa, Halifax, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver to promote the book, alongside various cast members.
A follow-up to the book called &quot;Dog River Confidential: The Super, Even More Complete Corner Gas Guide,&quot; also by author Michele Sponagle, was released by Penguin Canada on November 10, 2009.

===Corner Gas: The Movie===
&quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot; premiered on December 3, 2014, for a limited five-day release in select Canadian theaters. All of the major cast members returned for the film.

The fourth and final season premiered in July 2021 on CTV. Freevee announced in April 2022, as part of their rebrand from IMDb TV to Freevee, that the final season would release on June 20, 2022.

==Impact==

In 2006, &quot;Corner Gas&quot; aired in 26 countries. Free land was awarded through the &quot;Corner Gas&quot; website which enabled a Quebec couple to move to Climax. In Rouleau, a local resident started a &quot;Ruby&quot; café.

<text>The magisterium of the Catholic Church is the church&#x27;s authority or office to give authentic interpretation of the word of God, &quot;whether in its written form or in the form of Tradition&quot;. According to the 1992 &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, the task of interpretation is vested uniquely in the Pope and the bishops, though the concept has a complex history of development. Scripture and Tradition &quot;make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which is entrusted to the Church&quot;, and the magisterium is not independent of this, since &quot;all that it proposes for belief as being divinely revealed is derived from this single deposit of faith.&quot;

== Solemn and ordinary ==

The exercise of the Catholic Church&#x27;s magisterium is sometimes, but only rarely, expressed in the solemn form of an &quot;ex cathedra&quot; papal declaration, &quot;when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, [the Bishop of Rome] defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church,&quot; or of a similar declaration by an ecumenical council. Such solemn declarations of the church&#x27;s teaching involve the infallibility of the Church.

Pope Pius IX&#x27;s definition of the Immaculate Conception of Mary and Pope Pius XII&#x27;s definition of the Assumption of Mary are examples of such solemn papal pronouncements. Most dogmas have been promulgated at ecumenical councils. Examples of solemn declarations by ecumenical councils are the Council of Trent&#x27;s decree on justification and the First Vatican Council&#x27;s definition of papal infallibility.

The Catholic Church&#x27;s magisterium is exercised without this solemnity in statements by popes and bishops, whether collectively (as by an episcopal conference) or singly, in written documents such as catechisms, encyclicals, and pastoral letters, or orally, as in homilies. These statements are part of the &quot;ordinary&quot; magisterium of the church.

The First Vatican Council declared that, &quot;all those things are to be believed with divine and Catholic faith which are contained in the Word of God, written or handed down, and which the Church, either by a solemn judgment or by her ordinary and universal teaching magisterium, proposes for belief as having been divinely revealed.&quot;

The Second Vatican Council declared further that not everything contained in the statements of the ordinary magisterium is infallible, but the Catholic Church holds that the Church&#x27;s infallibility is invested in the statements of its &quot;universal&quot; ordinary magisterium: &quot;Although the bishops, taken individually, do not enjoy the privilege of infallibility, they do, however, proclaim infallibly the doctrine of Christ on the following conditions: namely, when, even though dispersed throughout the world but preserving for all that amongst themselves and with Peter&#x27;s successor the bond of communion, in their authoritative teaching concerning matters of faith or morals, they are in agreement that a particular teaching is to be held definitively and absolutely.&quot;

Such teachings of the ordinary and universal magisterium are obviously not given in a single specific document. They are teachings upheld as authoritative, generally for a long time, by the entire body of bishops. Examples given are the teaching on the reservation of ordination to males and on the immorality of procured abortion.

Even public statements by popes or bishops on questions of faith or morals that do not qualify as &quot;ordinary and universal magisterium&quot; have an authority that Catholics are not free to merely dismiss. They are required to give that teaching religious submission:

==Etymology==
The word &quot;magisterium&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;magister&quot;, which means &quot;teacher&quot; in ecclesiastical Latin. (It originally had a more general meaning, and could designate president, chief, director, superintendent, etc., and was only rarely a tutor or instructor of youth.) The noun &quot;magisterium&quot; refers to the office of a &quot;magister&quot;. Thus the relationship between &quot;magister&quot; and &quot;magisterium&quot; is the same as the relationship in English between &quot;president&quot; and &quot;presidency&quot;.

Since the time of Pope Pius XII, the word &quot;magisterium&quot; has also been used to refer to the persons who hold this office.

==Source and criteria==
The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus Christ is the source of divine revelation. The Catholic Church bases all of its teachings on sacred tradition and sacred scripture. The Magisterium consists in only all the infallible teachings of the Church, &quot;Wherefore, by divine and Catholic faith all those things are to be believed which are contained in the word of God as found in Scripture and tradition, and which are proposed by the Church as matters to be believed as divinely revealed, whether by her solemn judgment or in her ordinary and universal Magisterium.&quot; (First Vatican Council, &quot;Dei Filius&quot;, 8.) However, the criteria for the infallibility of these two functions of the sacred Magisterium are different. The sacred magisterium consists of both the extraordinary and dogmatic decrees of the Pope and ecumenical councils, and the Ordinary and Universal Magisterium.

The Second Vatican Council states, &quot;For this reason Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through His whole work of making Himself present and manifesting Himself: through His words and deeds, His signs and wonders, but especially through His death and glorious resurrection from the dead and final sending of the Spirit of truth.&quot; (&quot;Dei verbum&quot;, 4). The content of Christ&#x27;s divine revelation, as faithfully passed on by the Apostles, is called the Deposit of Faith, and consists of both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition.

The infallible teachings of the ecumenical councils consist of the solemn dogmatic, theological or moral definitions as contained in declarations, decrees, doctrines and condemnations (traditionally expressed in conciliar canons and decrees) of councils consisting of the pope and the bishops from all over the world.

A teaching of ordinary and universal magisterium is a teaching on which all bishops (including the Pope) universally agree, and is also considered infallible. Such a teaching must also be a part of the &quot;sensus fidelium&quot;.

==Levels==
Only the Pope and bishops in communion with him exercise the office of magisterium; theologians and schismatic bishops do not.

==Historical development==

===Early Church===

====Bishops as authority====
The most basic foundation of the Magisterium, the apostolic succession of bishops and their authority as protectors of the faith, was one of the few points that was rarely debated by the Church Fathers. The doctrine was elaborated by Ignatius of Antioch (and others) in the face of Gnosticism, expounded by others such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, and Augustine, and by the end of the 2nd century AD was universally accepted by the bishops.

Some of the first problems began to arise, however, with the increasing worldliness of the clergy. Criticism arose against the bishops, and an attempt was made to have all bishops drawn from the ranks of monastic communities, whose men were seen as the holiest possible leaders. However, there had also developed in the Church a Roman sense of government, which insisted upon order at any cost, and this led to the phenomenon of the “imperial bishops,” men who had to be obeyed by virtue of their position, regardless of their personal holiness, and the distinction between “man” and “office.”

====Early disagreements====
This understanding was not universally accepted. According to Robert B. Eno, Origen was one of the most famous critics of the episcopal corruption. He says that throughout Origen&#x27;s life, many of his writings were considered to be questionably orthodox, and he seemed to espouse the idea of a teaching authority based on theological expertise alone rather than, or at least along with, apostolic succession.

Another early disagreement in the Church surrounding the issue of authority manifested itself in Montanism, which began as a movement promoting the charism of prophecy. Montanism claimed, among other things, that prophecies like those found in the Old Testament were continuing in the Church, and that new prophecies had the same authority as apostolic teaching. The Church, however, ruled that these new prophecies were not authoritative, and condemned Montanism as a heresy. Other times, private revelations were recognized by the Church, but the Church continues to teach that private revelations are altogether separate from the deposit of faith, and that they are not required to be believed by all Catholics.

===Era of the ecumenical councils===
The first seven ecumenical councils, presided over by the emperor with representatives from all important metropolitan sees including Jerusalem, Constantinople, and Rome among others, exercised an important authority to define doctrine seen as essential to most contemporary Christians, including the divinity of Christ and the two natures of Christ. These councils also produced various creeds, including the Nicene Creed. The official language of these councils, including all authoritative texts produced, was Greek. The relation between the councils and patriarchal authority was complex. For example, the sixth council, the Third Council of Constantinople, condemned both monoenergism and monothelitism and included those who had supported this heresy, including Pope Honorius I and four previous patriarchs of Constantinople.

===Medieval period===
Perceptions of teaching authority in the Middle Ages are hard to characterize because they were so varied. While there arose a keener understanding and acceptance of papal primacy (at least after the Great Schism), there was also an increased emphasis placed on the theologian, and there were numerous dissenters from both views.

====Era of Charlemagne====
As part of the flourishing of culture and renewal under his reign, the Emperor Charlemagne commissioned one of the first major church-wide studies of the patristic era. This &quot;golden age&quot; or Carolingian Renaissance greatly influenced the identity of the Church. New texts were being discovered and disseminated at rapid pace in the late 700s and early 800s and patristic authorship became important for establishing a text&#x27;s authority in Catholic theology. Unfortunately also at this time, a series of power struggles emerged between diocesan bishops and their metropolitans. As part of this struggle, a series of elaborate forgeries were produced, capitalizing on the cultural renaissance of the time and eagerness to discover new texts. The Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals asserted Roman papal power to depose and appoint bishops for the first time by deriving this power from forgeries of texts of the fathers of early church, interlaced with texts already known to be legitimate. These decretals had an enormous influence on concentrating the teaching power of the pope, and were not uncovered as forgeries until the 1500s or universally acknowledged to be forgeries until the 1800s.

====Theologians====
Many concepts of teaching authority gained prominence in the Middle Ages, including the concept of the authority of the learned expert, an idea which began with Origen (or even earlier) and still today has proponents. Some allowed for the participation of theologians in the teaching life of the church, but still drew distinctions between the powers of the theologian and bishops; one example of this view is in the writing of St. Thomas Aquinas, who spoke of the “Magisterium cathedrae pastoralis” ( of the pastoral chair) and the “Magisterium cathedrae magistralis” (Magisterium of a master’s chair). The highest order of the Magisterium cathedrae pastoralis mentioned is the episcopacy itself, and at the top the pope: &quot;Magis est standum sententiae Papae, ad quem pertinet determinare de fide, quam in iudicio profert, quam quorumlibet sapientum hominum in Scripturis opinioni.&quot; Others held more extreme views, such as Godefroid of Fontaines, who insisted that the theologian had a right to maintain his own opinions in the face of episcopal and even papal rulings.

Until the formation of the Roman Inquisition in the 16th century, the central authority to discover the norm for Catholic truth by means of the study and commentary on scripture and tradition was universally seen as being the role of the theology faculties of universities. The Paris faculty of theology at the Sorbonne rose in prominence to be the most important in the Christian world. A common act of kings, bishops, and popes in matters of church or state with regard to religion was to poll the universities, especially the Sorbonne, on theological questions so as to obtain opinions from the masters before making their own judgment. In the Catholic Church today, this custom is still observed (at least pro forma) in the retention of an official Theologian of the Pontifical Household, who often advises the pope on matters of controversy.

====Papal primacy and teaching authority====
Throughout the Middle Ages, support for the primacy of the pope (spiritually and temporally) and his ability to speak authoritatively on matters of doctrine grew significantly as the Decretals of Isadore became widely accepted. Two popes, Innocent III (1198–1216) and Boniface VIII (1294–1303), were especially influential in advancing the power of the papacy. Innocent asserted that the pope&#x27;s power was a right bestowed by God, and developed the idea of the pope not only as a teacher and spiritual leader but also a secular ruler. Boniface, in the papal bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot;, asserted that the spiritual world, headed on earth by the pope, has authority over the temporal world, and that all must submit themselves to the authority of the pope to be saved.

====Papal infallibility====
In the &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian, a 12th-century canon lawyer, the pope is attributed the legal right to pass judgment in theological disputes, but he was certainly not guaranteed freedom from error. The pope’s role was to establish limits within which theologians, who were often better suited for the full expression of truth, could work. Thus, the pope’s authority was as a judge, not as an infallible teacher.

The doctrine began to visibly develop during the Reformation, leading to a formal statement of the doctrine by St. Robert Bellarmine in the early 17th century, but it did not come into widespread acceptance until the 19th century and the First Vatican Council.

====Council of Constance (1414–1418)====
A significant development in the teaching authority of the Church occurred from 1414 to 1418 with the Council of Constance, which effectively ran the Church during the Great Schism, during which there were three men claiming to be the pope. An early decree of this council, &quot;Haec Sancta&quot;, challenged the primacy of the pope, saying that councils represent the church, are imbued with their power directly by Christ, and are binding even for the pope in matters of faith. This declaration was later declared void by the Church because the early sessions of the council had not been confirmed by a pope, but it demonstrates that there were still conciliar currents in the church running against the doctrine of papal primacy, likely influenced by the corruption seen in the papacy during this time period.

====Council of Basle (1439)====
The theologian continued to play a more prominent role in the teaching life of the church, as “doctors” were called upon more and more to help bishops form doctrinal opinions. Illustrating this, at the Council of Basle in 1439, bishops and other clergy were greatly outnumbered by doctors of theology.

Despite this growth in influence, popes still asserted their power to crack down on those perceived as “rogue” theologians, through councils (for example, in the cases of Peter Abelard and Beranger) and commissions (as with Nicolas of Autrecourt, Ockham, and Eckhart). With the coming of the Reformation in 1517, this assertion of papal power came to a head and the primacy and authority of the papacy over theologians was vigorously re-established. However, the Council of Trent re-introduced the collaboration between theologians and council Fathers, and the next centuries leading up to the First and Second Vatican Councils were generally accepting of a broader role for the learned in the Church, although the popes still kept a close eye on theologians and intervened occasionally.

==== Late medieval period ====
In the late medieval period, statements of this papal power were common in the works of theologians as well. For example, Domingo Bañez attributed to the Pope the “definitive power to declare the truths of the faith,&quot; and Thomas Cajetan, in expanding the distinction made by St. Thomas Aquinas, drew a line between personal faith manifested in theologians and the authoritative faith presented as a matter of judgment by the pope.

===Vatican councils and their Popes===

====Pius IX and Vatican I====

In the late Middle Ages, the concept of papal infallibility came to fruition, but a definitive statement and explanation of these doctrines did not occur until the 19th century, with Pope Pius IX and the First Vatican Council (1869–1870). Pius IX was the first pope to use the term “Magisterium” in the sense that it is understood today, and the concept of the “ordinary and universal Magisterium” was officially established during Vatican I. In addition, this council defined the doctrine of papal infallibility, the ability of the pope to speak without error “when, acting in his capacity as pastor and teacher of all Christians, he commits his supreme authority in the universal Church on a question of faith or morals.” This declaration wasn&#x27;t without some controversy; the bishops of Uniate Churches walked out en masse rather than voting against the declaration in session, and the resulting declaration also had a great deal to do with the finalization of the Old Catholic Church schism that had been festering for some time. John Henry Newman accepted the Council&#x27;s authority, but questioned whether the Council was truly an &quot;ecumenical&quot; council.

====Pius XII and Paul VI====
Later, Pope Pius XII (reigned 1939–1958) authoritatively stated the scope of the Magisterium further, stating that the faithful must be obedient to even the ordinary Magisterium of the Pope, and that “there can no longer be any question of free discussion between theologians” once the Pope has spoken on a given issue.

Pope Paul VI (reigned 1963–1978) agreed with this view. Theology and the magisterium have the same source, revelation, and closely cooperate: the Magisterium does not receive a revelation to resolve disputed questions. The theologian, in obedience to the magisterium, tries to develop answers to new questions. The magisterium in turn needs this work in order to authoritatively give solutions to modern problems in the area of faith and morals. Theology again, accepts these answers and serves as a bridge between the magisterium and the faithful, explaining the reasons behind the teaching of the magisterium.

===Postconciliar era===
The debate concerning the Magisterium, papal primacy and infallibility, and the authority to teach in general has not lessened since the official declaration of the doctrines. Instead, the Church has faced contrary arguments; at one end there are those with the tendency to regard even technically non-binding papal encyclicals as infallible statements and, at the other, are those who refuse to accept in any sense controversial encyclicals such as &quot;Humanae Vitae.&quot; There are also those who, like John Henry Newman, question whether the First Vatican Council was itself an ecumenical council, and as a result whether the dogma of papal infallibility itself as defined at that council was a fallible pronouncement. The situation is complicated by changing attitudes toward authority in an increasingly democratic world, the new importance placed on academic freedom, and new means of knowledge and communication. In addition, the authority of theologians is being revisited, with theologians pushing past the structures laid out by Pius XII to claim authority in theology in their own right such as was the case in the middle ages. Others simply regard themselves purely as academics not in the service of any institution.

In September 2018, the Synod of Bishops was granted Magisterium over documents which are approved at their Synods.

<doc id="437044" wikidata="Q1740071" url="?curid=437044" title="Kevin and Kell">
<text>Kevin and Kell is a furry comedy webcomic strip by syndicated cartoonist Bill Holbrook. The strip began on September 3, 1995, and is one of the oldest continuously running webcomics. The comic&#x27;s website states it is &quot;The World&#x27;s Longest Running Daily Webcomic&quot;.

The strip centers on the mixed marriage between Kevin Dewclaw, a rabbit, and Kell Dewclaw, a grey wolf. In their society, their major difference is their diet: Kevin is a herbivore and Kell is a carnivore. Their family includes three children: Lindesfarne, a hedgehog adopted from Kevin&#x27;s first marriage; Rudy, a wolf/fox hybrid from Kell&#x27;s first marriage; and their only biological child Coney, a omnivorous rabbit. The comic&#x27;s plot revolves around species-related humor, satire, and interpersonal conflict.

&quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; reports receiving over three million page views each month. It was also published in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; for ten years. Holbrook has won honors from the Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards and the Ursa Major Awards for the strip.

==Setting==
&quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; takes place in a town called Domain, populated entirely by animals. According to the comic, its world was created by an organization of birds, commonly referred to by fans of the comic as the &quot;Great Bird Conspiracy&quot; (GBC). Birds were the next species after humans to reach sapience. After humans left the planet, the birds traveled back in time to create a world without humans, and gave intelligence to fauna. However, their plan to remove the predator-prey relationship failed and as a result, the world created is similar to that of twenty-first century Earth, but with a greater likelihood of a violent death.

The society in &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; rather than identifying people by race or social class has class distinctions based on diet such as &quot;carnivores&quot;, &quot;herbivores&quot;, &quot;insectivores&quot; and &quot;omnivores.&quot; There is also a &quot;Wild&quot; where civilized animals can leave civilization and act like normal animals, walking on all fours and not wearing clothing. Predation is central to strips and jokes are made about it being commonplace.

Humans exist in an alternate Domain, and are referred to as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures, but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. 

The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture. For example, in January 2008 the Predator&#x27;s Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.

==Main characters==
The strip&#x27;s main characters are the Dewclaws, a blended family as a result of an interspecies marriage. The comic&#x27;s primary characters are Kevin Dewclaw, a rabbit, and his wife Kell Dewclaw, a wolf. They met in a web forum for carnivores, where Kevin was &quot;lurking&quot;. They began to fall in love, but it was not until they met each other in person that Kell discovered Kevin was a rabbit. The relationship they developed online leads them to continue dating and eventually marry, despite knowing that they would be outcasts from the rest of society.

Originally, Kevin worked as a system operator on a herbivore web forum, although he later became the co-owner of his own internet service provider, &quot;Hare-Link&quot;. Kell worked for &quot;Herd-Thinners&quot;, a company that hunts down prey. Her job is to hunt down other animals. Originally she hunted down her own prey – any prey not eaten by her is later sold in grocery stores as &quot;processed meat&quot; – but she later became an executive and then CEO of the company, taking over from her old boss R.L., a ruthless wolf whose face is never seen apart from his drooling muzzle. Kell was eventually pushed out of her executive position in a bloodless coup by R.L., and started running her own start-up company &quot;Dewclaw&#x27;s Fine Meat Products&quot; that exclusively doesn&#x27;t hunt rabbits.

The couple has three children. The eldest is Lindesfarne Dewclaw, an English hedgehog daughter Kevin adopted during his first marriage. The second eldest child is Rudy, Kell&#x27;s son from her first marriage to a fox. Rudy, a talented artist, once challenged Kevin for the position of alpha male, unable to accept a rabbit as head of the household and as his stepfather. He has since matured and has come to terms with the marriage. The youngest child is Coney, a omnivorous rabbit and their only child by birth. Although ten years old, she is a capable apex hunter, though Kevin&#x27;s mother, Dorothy, initially tried to convert her into an herbivore but gradually accepted her mixed diet. Coney also has an artistic streak like her half-brother. Now entering her tweens, she&#x27;s currently performing her annual duties in being the bodyguard to her cousin Wendell Luckyfoot, the Easter Bunny in their county; along with her tigress best friend, Lin Lee, who has a major crush on him.

Other regular characters include: Fenton Fuscus, a bat who is married to Lindesfarne and with her have a hedgehog-bat hybrid daughter, Turvy; Fiona Fennec, a half-red, half-Fennec fox vixen who being Rudy&#x27;s longtime girlfriend since their early teens, has recently married him; George Fennec, Fiona&#x27;s father who is married to Danielle, a sister of Kevin, and have a human son, Francis (the first of its kind in this world) since Danielle herself was human once; and Ralph Dewclaw, Kell&#x27;s brother who was originally hostile to Kevin, but now accepts the rabbit as family after several unsuccessful hunting attempts. He now works for Kevin as part of &quot;Hare-Link&quot; and is married to George&#x27;s former wife Martha. Another character is Daisy, a daisy plant made intelligent by the GBC. It lives with the Dewclaws as a pet, having the same intelligence as a dog or cat in our world.

==History==
&quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; was one of the first comic strips to be syndicated online, although older webcomics exist. For example, &quot;Argon Zark!&quot; was created in June 1995, three months before &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot;. However, Holbrook states that webcomics with earlier start dates have &quot;(to the best of my knowledge) either ceased or has had significant multi-year hiatuses.&quot; 

The strip started in black and white, changing to color on June 23, 2000. It is currently colored by husband and wife team Terrence and Isabel Marks. The strip has been considered for an animated television series, the latest attempt being filmed in spring 2011. &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; appeared daily in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; from 2004 to 2014, after winning a contest where several new comics (syndicated and/or online) were considered and voted on by readers. During its time with the AJC, Holbrook stated that this constituted the &quot;bulk of his readership&quot;, citing the paper&#x27;s circulation. In 2009, &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; survived a cull of several comic strips from the paper, and in an online poll was voted as the favorite of the paper&#x27;s readers.

Holbrook writes two other strips; &quot;On the Fastrack&quot; and &quot;Safe Havens&quot;. He uses a &quot;three-week schedule&quot;, saying in several interviews, &quot;During this week, for instance, I&#x27;ll be writing three week&#x27;s worth of &quot;Fastrack&quot; material, and drawing the 21 gags I wrote for &quot;Kevin &amp; Kell&quot; last week. Next week I&#x27;ll write for &quot;Safe Havens&quot; while drawing the &quot;Fastrack&quot; batch. And on it goes… On a typical day I&#x27;ll begin by writing four gags by 2:00, then I&#x27;ll begin drawing, usually doing about four strips. At night, after everyone goes to bed, I&#x27;ll write two gags.&quot;

In 1998, Holbrook was named &quot;Cartoonist of the Year&quot; at Pogofest, in part for his work on &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot;. In 2001, the strip won the award for &quot;Best Anthropomorphic Comic&quot; at the Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards, and was nominated for the same award in 2002. In 2003, &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; won the award for &quot;Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip&quot; at the Ursa Major Awards.

==Reception==
Since its creation, &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; been mainly been given positive reviews, although there has also been some criticism. Zompist.com comic reviewer &quot;Bob&quot; praised the way the comic is written and illustrated, and its dealings with difficult issues such as divorce and death. However, he criticized its suburban nature, saying: &quot;All the family crises are defused within a week or two. No one has any aspirations besides a computer-related job and a quiet heterosexual romance. There seem to be no cities, no foreign nations, no art, no teenage sex.&quot; Another review from &quot;Disjointed Ramblings&quot; commented on the use of satire in the comic, writing that &quot;while the satire is usually gentle, there&#x27;s plenty of it.&quot;

Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s review in &quot;The Official Time Waster&#x27;s Guide&quot; cites the comic&#x27;s world design, longevity and a discomforting setting where intelligent animals are killed as strengths. However, Sanderson also complained that Holbrook does not enforce this aspect in the main characters, saying, &quot;While Kell, Rudy, and others make kills every day, none of the main character herbivores ever really have to worry about being stalked and killed. When they are threatened (such as when Lindesfarne is stalked by some cougars near the beginning of the comic&#x27;s run), the enemy predators are presented as dark, evil things to be defeated.…This sense of careless, off-handed killing gives the comic a lot of its humor—however, to maintain that air of humor, Bill never allows the society to work its everyday worst on any of the main characters.&quot;

During a review in webcomic podcast &quot;Digital Strips&quot;, commentator Daku described &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; as &quot;one of the few anthropomorphic strips that I actually like,&quot; saying that &quot;this is as if animals had a society.&quot; Zampzon praises the quality of the artwork, but complains that the strip relies on too many animal jokes. Writer T. Campbell wrote that Holbrook brought &quot;an air of legitimacy and professionalism that many web cartoonists lacked then and still lack now.&quot;

&quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; and Holbrook are both popular within the furry fandom. Holbrook was first contacted by the fandom in late 1995, soon after the strip was published. He attended his first furry convention, ConFurence, in January 1997. Holbrook holds an annual &quot;&quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; patron social&quot; at Anthrocon for people who sponsor the strip. Holbrook also works occasionally with other cartoonists, both furry and non-furry, and characters from his strip make cameos in other strips. These have included &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot;, &quot;General Protection Fault&quot;, &quot;PartiallyClips&quot;, and &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot;.

==Products==

There are 27 books containing collections of &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; strips, including bonus strips. They are currently published by Holbrook&#x27;s own publishing imprint, Pencil Rough Productions, with older books originally published by Plan 9 Publishing and briefly with Moonbase Press.

A role-playing game based on &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; was released in July 2005 by &quot;Comstar Games&quot;. &quot;Hare Link&quot;, the Internet Service Provider run by Kevin, was a real-life ISP for some time.

In November 2010, a &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; iPhone/iPod/iPad app was released to the iTunes App Store. The app is a joint product between Bill Holbrook and the developers of the app, WareTo. The app allows users to read the entire Kevin &amp; Kell library of cartoons, and contains additional features and content including video, cast descriptions, and hidden surprise &quot;Easter eggs.&quot;

According to Write 2 Now&#x27;s December 2010 newsletter, Holbrook and Phil Rogers were working to get the strip made into an animated cartoon series, with a pitch to cable executives, but a deal was never made.

<doc id="437045" wikidata="Q5950039" url="?curid=437045" title="Hustling">
<text>Hustling is the deceptive act of disguising one&#x27;s skill in a sport or game with the intent of luring someone of probably lesser skill into gambling (or gambling for higher than current stakes) with the hustler, as a form of both a confidence trick and match fixing. It is most commonly associated with, and originated in pocket billiards (pool), but also can be performed with regard to other sports and gambling activities. Hustlers may also engage in &quot;&quot;—distracting, disheartening, enraging, or even threatening their opponents—to throw them off. Hustlers are thus often called &quot;pool sharks&quot;. Professional and semi-pro hustlers sometimes work with a &quot;—a person who provides the money for the hustler to bet with (and who may assist in the hustling)—in exchange for a substantial portion of all winnings. Another form of hustling (often engaged in by the same hustlers who use the skill-disguising technique) is challenging &quot; (swindle targets) to bet on trick shots that seem nearly impossible but at which the hustler is exceptionally skilled.
Chess hustlers are quite common in urban areas in the United States and elsewhere, often offering speed chess against any takers. Unlike most hustlers, chess hustlers are often assumed to be skilled and are seen as a challenge.

==Pool hustling techniques==
Pool hustlers use deception and misdirection in order to win cash from inexperienced players (or skilled players inexperienced with the world of hustling). A skilled hustler:

*will usually play with a low-quality &quot;house&quot; cue stick provided by the pool hall, or an unadorned but high-quality personal cue that looks like one, known as a &quot;&quot; (or, with the nascence of local competitive league play in recent years, may play with a flashy-looking but evidently low-end personal cue, to give the impression that the hustler is a beginning league player);
*will typically play a game or two for &quot;fun&quot; or for low bets (a beer or equivalent amount of cash, for example) in order to check out the opponent and give the impression that money can easily be won, often losing on purpose (known as &quot; or &quot;) – with the intent of winning a much larger wager later against a predictably overconfident opponent;
*will pocket some difficult and impressive shots or make surprisingly secure safety shots (ones crucial for winning), while missing many simple ones, thus making early victories appear to be sheer luck (a variant being the theatrical almost-making of shots that inexperienced players may think of as crucial mistakes, but which really give away very little advantage);
*may pretend to be intoxicated, unintelligent, or otherwise impaired (that is, until it is time to run the table or make a game-winning shot).
*when betting on trick shots, may intentionally miss the first or several times and lose a small amount, then raise the bet to an amount well beyond the loss and succeed at the well-practiced feat.

Many of these ploys can easily be mistaken for the honest faults of a less-than-exceptional player. The engendered doubt and uncertainty is what allows hustling to succeed, with the &quot;faults&quot; being dropped when a significant amount of money is at stake.

==In popular culture==

Pool hustling is the subject of numerous works of popular culture. In Damon Runyon&#x27;s short stories &quot;Dream Street Rose&quot; (&quot;More Than Somewhat&quot;, 1937) and &quot;Madame La Gimp&quot; (&quot;Furthermore&quot;, 1938), the fictional characters Frank and Judge Henry G. Blake respectively are pool hustlers. Other examples include films such as &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Color of Money&quot; (1986) (both adapted from earlier novels, &quot;see &quot;Books&quot;, below&quot;), among others &quot;(see &quot;Films&quot;, below)&quot;. An examplar in music is Jim Croce&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot;, in which the character Slim teaches a lesson to Big Jim about pool hustling. Pool hustling is also the principal subject of episodes of various television programs, including &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; episode &quot;Hustling the Hustler&quot; (season 2, episode 5, 1962), the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; episode &quot;Pool Hall Blues&quot; (sn. 2, ep. 18, 1990), &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; episode &quot;Banks Shot&quot; (sn. 1, ep. 22, 1991), &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; episodes &quot;Pool Sharks Git Bit&quot; (sn. 1, ep. 12, 1996) followed up with &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Cue for Love&quot; (sn. 3, ep. 6, 1998), and the &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; episode &quot;Pool Shark&quot; (sn. 2, ep. 5, 2004). Additionally, the main characters of the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, Dean and Sam Winchester, are also pool hustlers as one of their sources of income (various episodes, 2005–2020).

* Danny &quot;Kid Delicious&quot; Basavich, former hustler turned top-ranking pool professional
* Billy &quot;Cornbread Red&quot; Burge, pool player from Detroit
* Keith McCready, a notorious pool hustler

<doc id="437047" wikidata="Q380437" url="?curid=437047" title="Walid Jumblatt">
<text>Walid Kamal Jumblatt (; born 7 August 1949) is a Lebanese politician who was the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party from 1977 until 2023. A Druze and former militia commander, Jumblatt led the Lebanese National Resistance Front and allied with the Amal Movement during the Lebanese Civil War. He worked closely with Suleiman Frangieh to oppose Amine Gemayel&#x27;s rule as president in 1983. After the civil war, he initially supported Syria but later led an anti-Assad stance during the start of the Syrian Civil War. He is still active in politics, most recently leading his party, the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) in the 2022 Lebanese general election.

==Early life and education==
Jumblatt was born in August 1949, the son of the PSP&#x27;s founder Kamal Jumblatt. He is the maternal grandson of Emir Shakib Arslan. Walid Jumblatt graduated from the American University of Beirut with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science and public administration in 1972.

The Jumblatt family is a part of the Canpolat tribe from Adıyaman, Kahramanmaraş and Malatya in Turkey. After their rebellion in the 17th century, they were settled in Lebanon.

==Career==
Upon graduation, Jumblatt worked as a reporter for &quot;An Nahar&quot; in Beirut. The BBC describes Jumblatt as &quot;leader of Lebanon&#x27;s most powerful Druze clan and heir to a leftist political dynasty based around the Progressive Socialist Party&quot;. Assem Qanso of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party of Lebanon accused Jumblatt of abandoning his father&#x27;s beliefs. On 12 January 1982, he survived a car bomb explosion near his house in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. In an Al Jazeera interview decades later, Jumblatt said that Elie Hobeika was responsible for the attack and said that Hobeika told him in a meeting in Damascus that he wanted to kill him. In July 1983, after Amine Gemayel became president, Suleiman Frangieh, Rashid Karami and Walid Jumblatt formed a Syrian-backed National Salvation Front to challenge Gemayel&#x27;s rule and the pact between Lebanon and Israel that was financially supported by the US. Jumblatt served as minister of public works, transport and tourism in the National Unity cabinet led by then prime minister Rashid Karami, which was formed in May 1984. His main ally during the war was Amal Movement&#x27;s leader, Nabih Berri.
In the 1996 Rafic Hariri cabinet, Walid Jumblatt was appointed Minister for Refugees. He was a supporter of Syria, but following the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in 2000, he campaigned for Damascus to relinquish control. Jumblatt&#x27;s close links with the Syrian old guard alienated him from the new presidency of Bashar al-Assad. This pitted him against then president Émile Lahoud and the Lebanese Shiite party Hezbollah of which he said: &quot;Their fighters have done a good job defying and defeating the Israeli army, OK, but the question we ask is where their allegiance goes: to a Lebanese strong central authority or somewhere else?&quot; In the 2009 general elections, Jumblatt won a seat from Shouf as part of the 14 March Alliance list. Following issues with Hezbollah&#x27;s community, his son Taymour Jumblatt fled to France with his family after multiple death threats which prevented him from joining the local political scene.

With the onset of the Syrian civil war, Jumblatt and the PSP moved towards an anti-Assad stance. Jumblatt has been crucial in negotiations regarding the Syrian Druze during the Syrian Civil War, and has stated about al-Nusra Front &quot;I cannot classify, like Western countries, Nusra as terrorist because most of Nusra are Syrians. The regime of Bashar obliged the Syrians to join Nusra&quot;. After al-Nusra Front allegedly killed 20 Druze villagers in Qalb Loze on 10 June 2015, Jumblatt responded that &quot;Any inciting rhetoric will not be beneficial, and you should remember that Bashar Assad&#x27;s policies pushed Syria into this chaos&quot;.

Jumblatt believes that the order to kill his father came from Hafez al-Assad. He said he would rather &quot;commit a political suicide&quot; than reconcile with his son Bashar al-Assad.

In 2014, Jumblatt declared himself in favor of the legalisation of cannabis in Lebanon. In 2015, he admitted hiding the Swedish spy Stig Bergling during the early 1990s in a remote place in Lebanon upon the request of Russian authorities. On 4–7 May 2015, Jumblatt testified at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon related to the investigations of the assassination of Rafic Hariri.

In May 2017, the trial of four men accused of conspiring to assassinate Walid Jumblatt began.

In late May 2023, Walid Jumblatt declared his resignation as leader of the Progressive Socialist Party after a 46-year tenure. Around 2,000 supporters gathered in Ain Zhalta, a Druze town in the Chouf mountains, where members of the Progressive Socialist Party named political heir, Taymour Jumblatt, as their new leader. Taymour was the sole contender.

On 22 December 2024, Jumblatt and his delegation met with Ahmed al-Sharaa, leader of the Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham, in Damascus following the fall of the Assad regime.

==Personal life==
At the age of 20, Jumblatt married an Iranian actress, ten years his senior. His father did not endorse the marriage and the two became estranged. In 1981, after a divorce and his father&#x27;s death, Jumblatt married Gervette, a Jordanian of Circassian descent. Together they had three children: Taymour, Aslan, and Dalia. Later he married Nora al-Sharabati, daughter of the former Syrian defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati. In 2018, his son Taymur Jumblatt replaced him as a candidate for parliamentary elections.

==Arts==
Like many political leaders, Jumblatt has been the subject of photography since the late 1970s. The photographer Ziad Antar made a portrait of him using an old expired film, which produced a ghostly effect. The image is said to evoke the danger the Lebanese Druze leader faces after he had criticized Hezbollah and the Syrian government.

<doc id="437051" wikidata="Q6490801" url="?curid=437051" title="Larry Merchant">
<text>Larry Merchant (born Larry Kaufman; February 11, 1931) is an American sportswriter, a longtime commentator for HBO sports presentations of &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;, &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot; and HBO pay-per-view telecasts, called &quot;the greatest television boxing analyst of all time&quot; by some, including ESPN Boxing analyst Dan Rafael.

== Early life and education ==
Merchant was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on February 11, 1931, to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma, Merchant was interested in entering professional sports broadcasting. However, due to the fear of antisemitism within the industry possibly halting any chances he had of succeeding, Merchant changed his legal surname &quot;Kaufman&quot; to its literal translation &quot;Merchant&quot;. In 1978, Merchant joined HBO Sports as an analyst. Prior to joining HBO Sports, Merchant was a well-regarded sports columnist with the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

== Career ==
Merchant was part of the &quot;HBO Boxing&quot; commentary team along with Barry Tompkins, Jim Lampley, Max Kellerman, Gil Clancy, Sugar Ray Leonard, George Foreman, Roy Jones Jr., Emanuel Steward, Lennox Lewis and Harold Lederman for championship and pay-per-view fights.

Among the fighters who have clashed with Merchant include Mike Tyson, Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather Jr. The De La Hoya incident came during his fight with Pernell Whitaker. When De la Hoya entered the ring to Mariachi music, Merchant stated that while he loved Mariachi music, he felt that it &quot;stunk&quot; in this particular situation. Merchant would later apologize on the air after De La Hoya tried to have him removed from HBO.

Merchant is well known for his post fight interviews which feature his hard-hitting, blunt questions and confrontational interview style. These have drawn both praise and ire in the past. Fans have claimed them to be candid and honest while detractors consider them to be purposely biased or agitating and insensitive at times. An example of this occurred when Vernon Forrest won a controversial decision in 2006 over Ike Quartey. When Forrest thanked those close to him, Merchant quipped, &quot;Would you also like to thank the judges?&quot;

In 1985, Merchant received the Sam Taub Award for Boxing Broadcast Journalism presented by the Boxing Writers Association of America. He is also the author of three books.

In October 2002, he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Los Angeles. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2009.

On January 23, 2009, HBO picked up Merchant&#x27;s two-year option at the end of his 2007 contract. Merchant continued to alternate &quot;World Championship Boxing&quot; telecasts and HBO PPV cards with Kellerman.

Among the many people that Merchant interviewed during his tenure as sportscaster on HBO Boxing was the future President of the United States Donald Trump before the fight between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks in 1988, and former South African President Nelson Mandela, the latter during a side-trip to Mozambique off an HBO Boxing program of the first Lennox Lewis-Hasim Rahman contest, which was held in South Africa in 2001.

==Health==
Merchant was hospitalized in critical condition in Los Angeles, California, following a medical emergency on December 21, 2023.

== Criticism ==
In September 2011, following the controversial ending to the fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Victor Ortiz, Mayweather angrily called for Merchant to be fired. After Merchant pressured Mayweather to respond to fans who thought that he had taken advantage of Ortiz&#x27;s apology (resulting in his win by knockout), Mayweather grew irritated by Merchant&#x27;s questioning and interrupted Merchant by saying &quot;You never give me a fair shake...They can put somebody else up here to give me an interview. HBO need to fire you. You don&#x27;t know shit about boxing. You ain&#x27;t shit...All of these boxing experts—how can you be a boxing expert if you never had a fight before?&quot; Floyd Mayweather Jr.&#x27;s outburst led to Merchant responding: &quot;I wish I was 50 years younger and I would kick your ass.&quot; Later, Mayweather defended his outburst by saying that &quot;Everybody is tired of Larry Merchant.&quot;

Merchant also engaged in a controversial exchange with Hall of Fame boxer Bernard Hopkins after his win over Morrade Hakkar on HBO, declaring that Hopkins was paid for doing little to no work. With his daughter in his arms, Hopkins replied, &quot;Let me tell you something Larry, you get paid everyday on TV for not doing much.&quot;

Dana White drew allegories between MMA commentator staff and stated negative opinions on Merchant.

During Merchant&#x27;s interview immediately following the bout between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Miguel Cotto (May 5, 2012), Merchant acknowledged that Mayweather had apologized the night before the bout and he had accepted the apology.

It was announced by HBO on December 13, 2012, that Larry Merchant would retire from broadcasting after the December 15, 2012, telecast of HBO&#x27;s World Championship Boxing from Houston, Texas after 35 years of being a boxing commentator on HBO.

Since leaving HBO Merchant has provided commentary for the international English language feed of some Top Rank promoted boxing shows.

<doc id="437052" wikidata="Q1747853" url="?curid=437052" title="Positional notation">
<text>Positional notation, also known as place-value notation, positional numeral system, or simply place value, usually denotes the extension to any base of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (or decimal system). More generally, a positional system is a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the value of the digit multiplied by a factor determined by the position of the digit. In early numeral systems, such as Roman numerals, a digit has only one value: I means one, X means ten and C a hundred (however, the values may be modified when combined). In modern positional systems, such as the decimal system, the position of the digit means that its value must be multiplied by some value: in 555, the three identical symbols represent five hundreds, five tens, and five units, respectively, due to their different positions in the digit string.

The Babylonian numeral system, base 60, was the first positional system to be developed, and its influence is present today in the way time and angles are counted in tallies related to 60, such as 60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle. Today, the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (base ten) is the most commonly used system globally. However, the binary numeral system (base two) is used in almost all computers and electronic devices because it is easier to implement efficiently in electronic circuits.

Systems with negative base, complex base or negative digits have been described. Most of them do not require a minus sign for designating negative numbers.

The use of a radix point (decimal point in base ten), extends to include fractions and allows the representation of any real number with arbitrary accuracy. With positional notation, arithmetical computations are much simpler than with any older numeral system; this led to the rapid spread of the notation when it was introduced in western Europe.

== History ==

Today, the base-10 (decimal) system, which is presumably motivated by counting with the ten fingers, is ubiquitous. Other bases have been used in the past, and some continue to be used today. For example, the Babylonian numeral system, credited as the first positional numeral system, was base-60. However, it lacked a real zero. Initially inferred only from context, later, by about 700 BC, zero came to be indicated by a &quot;space&quot; or a &quot;punctuation symbol&quot; (such as two slanted wedges) between numerals. It was a placeholder rather than a true zero because it was not used alone or at the end of a number. Numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60) looked the same because the larger number lacked a final placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.

The polymath Archimedes (ca. 287–212 BC) invented a decimal positional system based on 108 in his Sand Reckoner; 19th century German mathematician Carl Gauss lamented how science might have progressed had Archimedes only made the leap to something akin to the modern decimal system. Hellenistic and Roman astronomers used a base-60 system based on the Babylonian model (see ).

Before positional notation became standard, simple additive systems (sign-value notation) such as Roman numerals or Chinese numerals were used, and accountants in the past used the abacus or stone counters to do arithmetic until the introduction of positional notation.
Counting rods and most abacuses have been used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. With counting rods or abacus to perform arithmetic operations, the writing of the starting, intermediate and final values of a calculation could easily be done with a simple additive system in each position or column. This approach required no memorization of tables (as does positional notation) and could produce practical results quickly. 

The oldest extant positional notation system is either that of Chinese rod numerals, used from at least the early 8th century, or perhaps Khmer numerals, showing possible usages of positional-numbers in the 7th century. Khmer numerals and other Indian numerals originate with the Brahmi numerals of about the 3rd century BC, which symbols were, at the time, not used positionally. Medieval Indian numerals are positional, as are the derived Arabic numerals, recorded from the 10th century.

After the French Revolution (1789–1799), the new French government promoted the extension of the decimal system. Some of those pro-decimal efforts—such as decimal time and the decimal calendar—were unsuccessful. Other French pro-decimal efforts—currency decimalisation and the metrication of weights and measures—spread widely out of France to almost the whole world.

=== History of positional fractions ===
Decimal fractions were first developed and used by the Chinese in the form of rod calculus in the 1st century BC, and then spread to the rest of the world. J. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions were first used in the Arab by mathematician Abu&#x27;l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century. The Jewish mathematician Immanuel Bonfils used decimal fractions around 1350, but did not develop any notation to represent them. The Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī made the same discovery of decimal fractions in the 15th century. Al Khwarizmi introduced fractions to Islamic countries in the early 9th century; his fraction presentation was similar to the traditional Chinese mathematical fractions from Sunzi Suanjing. This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar was also used by 10th century Abu&#x27;l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi and 15th century Jamshīd al-Kāshī&#x27;s work &quot;Arithmetic Key&quot;.

The adoption of the decimal representation of numbers less than one, a fraction, is often credited to Simon Stevin through his textbook De Thiende; but both Stevin and E. J. Dijksterhuis indicate that Regiomontanus contributed to the European adoption of general decimals:
: European mathematicians, when taking over from the Hindus, &quot;via&quot; the Arabs, the idea of positional value for integers, neglected to extend this idea to fractions. For some centuries they confined themselves to using common and sexagesimal fractions ... This half-heartedness has never been completely overcome, and sexagesimal fractions still form the basis of our trigonometry, astronomy and measurement of time. ¶ ... Mathematicians sought to avoid fractions by taking the radius &quot;R&quot; equal to a number of units of length of the form 10&quot;n&quot; and then assuming for &quot;n&quot; so great an integral value that all occurring quantities could be expressed with sufficient accuracy by integers. ¶ The first to apply this method was the German astronomer Regiomontanus. To the extent that he expressed goniometrical line-segments in a unit &quot;R&quot;/10&quot;n&quot;, Regiomontanus may be called an anticipator of the doctrine of decimal positional fractions.

In the estimation of Dijksterhuis, &quot;after the publication of De Thiende only a small advance was required to establish the complete system of decimal positional fractions, and this step was taken promptly by a number of writers ... next to Stevin the most important figure in this development was Regiomontanus.&quot; Dijksterhuis noted that [Stevin] &quot;gives full credit to Regiomontanus for his prior contribution, saying that the trigonometric tables of the German astronomer actually contain the whole theory of &#x27;numbers of the tenth progress&#x27;.&quot;

=== Base of the numeral system ===
In mathematical numeral systems the radix is usually the number of unique digits, including zero, that a positional numeral system uses to represent numbers. In some cases, such as with a negative base, the radix is the absolute value formula_1 of the base . For example, for the decimal system the radix (and base) is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9. When a number &quot;hits&quot; 9, the next number will not be another different symbol, but a &quot;1&quot; followed by a &quot;0&quot;. In binary, the radix is two, since after it hits &quot;1&quot;, instead of &quot;2&quot; or another written symbol, it jumps straight to &quot;10&quot;, followed by &quot;11&quot; and &quot;100&quot;.

The highest symbol of a positional numeral system usually has the value one less than the value of the radix of that numeral system. The standard positional numeral systems differ from one another only in the base they use.

The radix is an integer that is greater than 1, since a radix of zero would not have any digits, and a radix of 1 would only have the zero digit. Negative bases are rarely used. In a system with more than formula_2 unique digits, numbers may have many different possible representations.

It is important that the radix is finite, from which follows that the number of digits is quite low. Otherwise, the length of a numeral would not necessarily be logarithmic in its size.

(In certain non-standard positional numeral systems, including bijective numeration, the definition of the base or the allowed digits deviates from the above.)

In standard base-ten (decimal) positional notation, there are ten decimal digits and the number
: formula_3.
In standard base-sixteen (hexadecimal), there are the sixteen hexadecimal digits (0–9 and A–F) and the number
: formula_4
where B represents the number eleven as a single symbol.

In general, in base-&quot;b&quot;, there are &quot;b&quot; digits formula_5 and the number
:formula_6
has formula_7
Note that formula_8 represents a sequence of digits, not multiplication.

=== Notation ===
When describing base in mathematical notation, the letter &quot;b&quot; is generally used as a symbol for this concept, so, for a binary system, &quot;b&quot; equals 2. Another common way of expressing the base is writing it as a decimal subscript after the number that is being represented (this notation is used in this article). 11110112 implies that the number 1111011 is a base-2 number, equal to 12310 (a decimal notation representation), 1738 (octal) and 7B16 (hexadecimal). In books and articles, when using initially the written abbreviations of number bases, the base is not subsequently printed: it is assumed that binary 1111011 is the same as 11110112.

The base &quot;b&quot; may also be indicated by the phrase &quot;base-&quot;b&quot;&quot;. So binary numbers are &quot;base-2&quot;; octal numbers are &quot;base-8&quot;; decimal numbers are &quot;base-10&quot;; and so on.

To a given radix &quot;b&quot; the set of digits {0, 1, ..., &quot;b&quot;−2, &quot;b&quot;−1} is called the standard set of digits. Thus, binary numbers have digits {0, 1}; decimal numbers have digits and so on. Therefore, the following are notational errors: 522, 22, 1A9. (In all cases, one or more digits is not in the set of allowed digits for the given base.)

=== Exponentiation ===
Positional numeral systems work using exponentiation of the base. A digit&#x27;s value is the digit multiplied by the value of its place. Place values are the number of the base raised to the &quot;n&quot;th power, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of other digits between a given digit and the radix point. If a given digit is on the left hand side of the radix point (i.e. its value is an integer) then &quot;n&quot; is positive or zero; if the digit is on the right hand side of the radix point (i.e., its value is fractional) then &quot;n&quot; is negative.

As an example of usage, the number 465 in its respective base &quot;b&quot; (which must be at least base 7 because the highest digit in it is 6) is equal to:
: formula_9

If the number 465 was in base-10, then it would equal:
: formula_10

If however, the number were in base 7, then it would equal:
: formula_11

10&quot;b&quot; = &quot;b&quot; for any base &quot;b&quot;, since 10&quot;b&quot; = 1×&quot;b&quot;1 + 0×&quot;b&quot;0. For example, 102 = 2; 103 = 3; 1016 = 1610. Note that the last &quot;16&quot; is indicated to be in base 10. The base makes no difference for one-digit numerals.

This concept can be demonstrated using a diagram. One object represents one unit. When the number of objects is equal to or greater than the base &quot;b&quot;, then a group of objects is created with &quot;b&quot; objects. When the number of these groups exceeds &quot;b&quot;, then a group of these groups of objects is created with &quot;b&quot; groups of &quot;b&quot; objects; and so on. Thus the same number in different bases will have different values:

 241 in base 5:
 2 groups of 52 (25) 4 groups of 5 1 group of 1
 ooooo ooooo
 ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
 ooooo ooooo + + o
 ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
 ooooo ooooo

 241 in base 8:
 2 groups of 82 (64) 4 groups of 8 1 group of 1
 oooooooo oooooooo
 oooooooo oooooooo
 oooooooo oooooooo oooooooo oooooooo
 oooooooo oooooooo + + o
 oooooooo oooooooo
 oooooooo oooooooo oooooooo oooooooo
 oooooooo oooooooo
 oooooooo oooooooo

The notation can be further augmented by allowing a leading minus sign. This allows the representation of negative numbers. For a given base, every representation corresponds to exactly one real number and every real number has at least one representation. The representations of rational numbers are those representations that are finite, use the bar notation, or end with an infinitely repeating cycle of digits.

=== Digits and numerals ===
A &quot;digit&quot; is a symbol that is used for positional notation, and a &quot;numeral&quot; consists of one or more digits used for representing a number with positional notation. Today&#x27;s most common digits are the decimal digits &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, and &quot;9&quot;. The distinction between a digit and a numeral is most pronounced in the context of a number base.

A non-zero &quot;numeral&quot; with more than one digit position will mean a different number in a different number base, but in general, the &quot;digits&quot; will mean the same. For example, the base-8 numeral 238 contains two digits, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, and with a base number (subscripted) &quot;8&quot;. When converted to base-10, the 238 is equivalent to 1910, i.e. 238 = 1910. In our notation here, the subscript &quot;8&quot; of the numeral 238 is part of the numeral, but this may not always be the case.

Imagine the numeral &quot;23&quot; as having an ambiguous base number. Then &quot;23&quot; could likely be any base, from base-4 up. In base-4, the &quot;23&quot; means 1110, i.e. 234 = 1110. In base-60, the &quot;23&quot; means the number 12310, i.e. 2360 = 12310. The numeral &quot;23&quot; then, in this case, corresponds to the set of base-10 numbers {11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, ..., 121, 123} while its digits &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; always retain their original meaning: the &quot;2&quot; means &quot;two of&quot;, and the &quot;3&quot; means &quot;three of&quot;.

In certain applications when a numeral with a fixed number of positions needs to represent a greater number, a higher number-base with more digits per position can be used. A three-digit, decimal numeral can represent only up to 999. But if the number-base is increased to 11, say, by adding the digit &quot;A&quot;, then the same three positions, maximized to &quot;AAA&quot;, can represent a number as great as 1330. We could increase the number base again and assign &quot;B&quot; to 11, and so on (but there is also a possible encryption between number and digit in the number-digit-numeral hierarchy). A three-digit numeral &quot;ZZZ&quot; in base-60 could mean . If we use the entire collection of our alphanumerics we could ultimately serve a base-&quot;62&quot; numeral system, but we remove two digits, uppercase &quot;I&quot; and uppercase &quot;O&quot;, to reduce confusion with digits &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;.
We are left with a base-60, or sexagesimal numeral system utilizing 60 of the 62 standard alphanumerics. (But see &quot;Sexagesimal system&quot; below.) In general, the number of possible values that can be represented by a formula_12 digit number in base formula_13 is formula_14.

The common numeral systems in computer science are binary (radix 2), octal (radix 8), and hexadecimal (radix 16). In binary only digits &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; are in the numerals. In the octal numerals, are the eight digits 0–7. Hex is 0–9 A–F, where the ten numerics retain their usual meaning, and the alphabetics correspond to values 10–15, for a total of sixteen digits. The numeral &quot;10&quot; is binary numeral &quot;2&quot;, octal numeral &quot;8&quot;, or hexadecimal numeral &quot;16&quot;.

=== Radix point ===

The notation can be extended into the negative exponents of the base &quot;b&quot;. Thereby the so-called radix point, mostly ».«, is used as separator of the positions with non-negative from those with negative exponent.

Numbers that are not integers use places beyond the radix point. For every position behind this point (and thus after the units digit), the exponent &quot;n&quot; of the power &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; decreases by 1 and the power approaches 0. For example, the number 2.35 is equal to:
:formula_15

=== Sign ===

If the base and all the digits in the set of digits are non-negative, negative numbers cannot be expressed. To overcome this, a minus sign, here »−«, is added to the numeral system. In the usual notation it is prepended to the string of digits representing the otherwise non-negative number.

=== Base conversion ===
The conversion to a base formula_16 of an integer represented in base formula_17 can be done by a succession of Euclidean divisions by formula_18 the right-most digit in base formula_16 is the remainder of the division of by formula_20 the second right-most digit is the remainder of the division of the quotient by formula_21 and so on. The left-most digit is the last quotient. In general, the th digit from the right is the remainder of the division by formula_16 of the th quotient.

For example: converting A10BHex to decimal (41227):
 0xA10B/10 = 0x101A R: 7 (ones place)
 0x101A/10 = 0x19C R: 2 (tens place)
 0x19C/10 = 0x29 R: 2 (hundreds place)
 0x29/10 = 0x4 R: 1 ...
 4

When converting to a larger base (such as from binary to decimal), the remainder represents formula_16 as a single digit, using digits from formula_17. For example: converting 0b11111001 (binary) to 249 (decimal):
 0b11111001/10 = 0b11000 R: 0b1001 (0b1001 = &quot;9&quot; for ones place)
 0b11000/10 = 0b10 R: 0b100 (0b100 = &quot;4&quot; for tens)
 0b10/10 = 0b0 R: 0b10 (0b10 = &quot;2&quot; for hundreds)

For the fractional part, conversion can be done by taking digits after the radix point (the numerator), and dividing it by the implied denominator in the target radix. Approximation may be needed due to a possibility of non-terminating digits if the reduced fraction&#x27;s denominator has a prime factor other than any of the base&#x27;s prime factor(s) to convert to. For example, 0.1 in decimal (1/10) is 0b1/0b1010 in binary, by dividing this in that radix, the result is 0b0.00011 (because one of the prime factors of 10 is 5). For more general fractions and bases see the algorithm for positive bases.

Alternatively, Horner&#x27;s method can be used for base conversion using repeated multiplications, with the same computational complexity as repeated divisions. A number in positional notation can be thought of as a polynomial, where each digit is a coefficient. Coefficients can be larger than one digit, so an efficient way to convert bases is to convert each digit, then evaluate the polynomial via Horner&#x27;s method within the target base. Converting each digit is a simple lookup table, removing the need for expensive division or modulus operations; and multiplication by x becomes right-shifting. However, other polynomial evaluation algorithms would work as well, like repeated squaring for single or sparse digits. Example:
 Convert 0xA10B to 41227
 A10B = (10*16^3) + (1*16^2) + (0*16^1) + (11*16^0)
 Lookup table:
 0x0 = 0
 0x1 = 1
 0x9 = 9
 0xA = 10
 0xB = 11
 0xC = 12
 0xD = 13
 0xE = 14
 0xF = 15
 Therefore 0xA10B&#x27;s decimal digits are 10, 1, 0, and 11.
 Lay out the digits out like this. The most significant digit (10) is &quot;dropped&quot;:
 10 1 0 11 &lt;- Digits of 0xA10B
 ---------------
 10
 Then we multiply the bottom number from the source base (16), the product is placed under the next digit of the source value, and then add:
 10 1 0 11
 160
 10 161
 Repeat until the final addition is performed:
 10 1 0 11
 160 2576 41216
 10 161 2576 41227
 and that is 41227 in decimal.

 Convert 0b11111001 to 249
 Lookup table:
 0b0 = 0
 0b1 = 1
 Result:
 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 &lt;- Digits of 0b11111001
 2 6 14 30 62 124 248
 1 3 7 15 31 62 124 249

=== Terminating fractions ===
The numbers which have a finite representation form the semiring
: formula_25
More explicitly, if formula_26 is a factorization of formula_27 into the primes formula_28 with exponents then with the non-empty set of denominators formula_29
we have
: formula_30
where formula_31 is the group generated by the formula_32 and formula_33 is the so-called localization of formula_34 with respect to 

The denominator of an element of formula_35 contains if reduced to lowest terms only prime factors out of formula_36.
This ring of all terminating fractions to base formula_27 is dense in the field of rational numbers formula_38. Its completion for the usual (Archimedean) metric is the same as for formula_38, namely the real numbers formula_40. So, if formula_41 then formula_42 has not to be confused with formula_43, the discrete valuation ring for the prime formula_44, which is equal to formula_45 with formula_46.

If formula_27 divides formula_48, we have formula_49

=== Infinite representations ===
==== Rational numbers ====
The representation of non-integers can be extended to allow an infinite string of digits beyond the point. For example, 1.12112111211112 ... base-3 represents the sum of the infinite series:
:formula_50

Since a complete infinite string of digits cannot be explicitly written, the trailing ellipsis (...) designates the omitted digits, which may or may not follow a pattern of some kind. One common pattern is when a finite sequence of digits repeats infinitely. This is designated by drawing a vinculum across the repeating block:
: formula_51

This is the repeating decimal notation (to which there does not exist a single universally accepted notation or phrasing).
For base 10 it is called a repeating decimal or recurring decimal.

An irrational number has an infinite non-repeating representation in all integer bases. Whether a rational number has a finite representation or requires an infinite repeating representation depends on the base. For example, one third can be represented by:
: formula_52
: formula_53
:: or, with the base implied:
:: formula_54 (see also 0.999...)
: formula_55
: formula_56

For integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; with &quot;gcd&quot; (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) = 1, the fraction &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; has a finite representation in base &quot;b&quot; if and only if each prime factor of &quot;q&quot; is also a prime factor of &quot;b&quot;.

For a given base, any number that can be represented by a finite number of digits (without using the bar notation) will have multiple representations, including one or two infinite representations:
# A finite or infinite number of zeroes can be appended:
#:formula_57
# The last non-zero digit can be reduced by one and an infinite string of digits, each corresponding to one less than the base, are appended (or replace any following zero digits):
#:formula_58
#:formula_59 (see also 0.999...)
#:formula_60

==== Irrational numbers ====

A (real) irrational number has an infinite non-repeating representation in all integer bases.

Examples are the non-solvable &quot;n&quot;th roots
: formula_61
with formula_62 and , numbers which are called algebraic, or numbers like
:formula_63
which are transcendental. The number of transcendentals is uncountable and the sole way to write them down with a finite number of symbols is to give them a symbol or a finite sequence of symbols.

== Applications ==

=== Decimal system ===

In the decimal (base-10) Hindu–Arabic numeral system, each position starting from the right is a higher power of 10. The first position represents 100 (1), the second position 101 (10), the third position 102 ( or 100), the fourth position 103 ( or 1000), and so on.

Fractional values are indicated by a separator, which can vary in different locations. Usually this separator is a period or full stop, or a comma. Digits to the right of it are multiplied by 10 raised to a negative power or exponent. The first position to the right of the separator indicates 10−1 (0.1), the second position 10−2 (0.01), and so on for each successive position.

As an example, the number 2674 in a base-10 numeral system is:
: (2 × 103) + (6 × 102) + (7 × 101) + (4 × 100)
or
: (2 × 1000) + (6 × 100) + (7 × 10) + (4 × 1).

=== Sexagesimal system ===
The sexagesimal or base-60 system was used for the integral and fractional portions of Babylonian numerals and other Mesopotamian systems, by Hellenistic astronomers using Greek numerals for the fractional portion only, and is still used for modern time and angles, but only for minutes and seconds. However, not all of these uses were positional.

Modern time separates each position by a colon or a prime symbol. For example, the time might be 10:25:59 (10 hours 25 minutes 59 seconds). Angles use similar notation. For example, an angle might be (10 degrees 25 minutes 59 seconds). In both cases, only minutes and seconds use sexagesimal notation—angular degrees can be larger than 59 (one rotation around a circle is 360°, two rotations are 720°, etc.), and both time and angles use decimal fractions of a second. This contrasts with the numbers used by Hellenistic and Renaissance astronomers, who used thirds, fourths, etc. for finer increments. Where we might write , they would have written or .

Using a digit set of digits with upper and lowercase letters allows short notation for sexagesimal numbers, e.g. 10:25:59 becomes &#x27;ARz&#x27; (by omitting I and O, but not i and o), which is useful for use in URLs, etc., but it is not very intelligible to humans.

In the 1930s, Otto Neugebauer introduced a modern notational system for Babylonian and Hellenistic numbers that substitutes modern decimal notation from 0 to 59 in each position, while using a semicolon (;) to separate the integral and fractional portions of the number and using a comma (,) to separate the positions within each portion. For example, the mean synodic month used by both Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomers and still used in the Hebrew calendar is 29;31,50,8,20 days, and the angle used in the example above would be written 10;25,59,23,31,12 degrees.

=== Computing ===
In computing, the binary (base-2), octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) bases are most commonly used. Computers, at the most basic level, deal only with sequences of conventional zeroes and ones, thus it is easier in this sense to deal with powers of two. The hexadecimal system is used as &quot;shorthand&quot; for binary—every 4 binary digits (bits) relate to one and only one hexadecimal digit. In hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are denoted by A, B, C, D, E, and F (and sometimes a, b, c, d, e, and f).

The octal numbering system is also used as another way to represent binary numbers. In this case the base is 8 and therefore only digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used. When converting from binary to octal every 3 bits relate to one and only one octal digit.

Hexadecimal, decimal, octal, and a wide variety of other bases have been used for binary-to-text encoding, implementations of arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and other applications.

&quot;For a list of bases and their applications, see list of numeral systems.&quot;

=== Other bases in human language ===
Base-12 systems (duodecimal or dozenal) have been popular because multiplication and division are easier than in base-10, with addition and subtraction being just as easy. Twelve is a useful base because it has many factors. It is the smallest common multiple of one, two, three, four and six. There is still a special word for &quot;dozen&quot; in English, and by analogy with the word for 102, &quot;hundred&quot;, commerce developed a word for 122, &quot;gross&quot;. The standard 12-hour clock and common use of 12 in English units emphasize the utility of the base. In addition, prior to its conversion to decimal, the old British currency Pound Sterling (GBP) &quot;partially&quot; used base-12; there were 12 pence (d) in a shilling (s), 20 shillings in a pound (£), and therefore 240 pence in a pound. Hence the term LSD or, more properly, £sd.

The Maya civilization and other civilizations of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica used base-20 (vigesimal), as did several North American tribes (two being in southern California). Evidence of base-20 counting systems is also found in the languages of central and western Africa.

Remnants of a Gaulish base-20 system also exist in French, as seen today in the names of the numbers from 60 through 99. For example, sixty-five is &quot;soixante-cinq&quot; (literally, &quot;sixty [and] five&quot;), while seventy-five is &quot;soixante-quinze&quot; (literally, &quot;sixty [and] fifteen&quot;). Furthermore, for any number between 80 and 99, the &quot;tens-column&quot; number is expressed as a multiple of twenty. For example, eighty-two is &quot;quatre-vingt-deux&quot; (literally, four twenty[s] [and] two), while ninety-two is &quot;quatre-vingt-douze&quot; (literally, four twenty[s] [and] twelve). In Old French, forty was expressed as two twenties and sixty was three twenties, so that fifty-three was expressed as two twenties [and] thirteen, and so on.

In English the same base-20 counting appears in the use of &quot;scores&quot;. Although mostly historical, it is occasionally used colloquially. Verse 10 of Psalm 90 in the King James Version of the Bible starts: &quot;The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow&quot;. The Gettysburg Address starts: &quot;Four score and seven years ago&quot;.

The Irish language also used base-20 in the past, twenty being &quot;fichid&quot;, forty &quot;dhá fhichid&quot;, sixty &quot;trí fhichid&quot; and eighty &quot;ceithre fhichid&quot;. A remnant of this system may be seen in the modern word for 40, &quot;daoichead&quot;.

The Welsh language continues to use a base-20 counting system, particularly for the age of people, dates and in common phrases. 15 is also important, with 16–19 being &quot;one on 15&quot;, &quot;two on 15&quot; etc. 18 is normally &quot;two nines&quot;. A decimal system is commonly used.

The Inuit languages use a base-20 counting system. Students from Kaktovik, Alaska invented a base-20 numeral system in 1994

Danish numerals display a similar base-20 structure.

The Māori language of New Zealand also has evidence of an underlying base-20 system as seen in the terms &quot;Te Hokowhitu a Tu&quot; referring to a war party (literally &quot;the seven 20s of Tu&quot;) and &quot;Tama-hokotahi&quot;, referring to a great warrior (&quot;the one man equal to 20&quot;).

The binary system was used in the Egyptian Old Kingdom, 3000 BC to 2050 BC. It was cursive by rounding off rational numbers smaller than 1 to , with a 1/64 term thrown away (the system was called the Eye of Horus).

A number of Australian Aboriginal languages employ binary or binary-like counting systems. For example, in Kala Lagaw Ya, the numbers one through six are &quot;urapon&quot;, &quot;ukasar&quot;, &quot;ukasar-urapon&quot;, &quot;ukasar-ukasar&quot;, &quot;ukasar-ukasar-urapon&quot;, &quot;ukasar-ukasar-ukasar&quot;.

North and Central American natives used base-4 (quaternary) to represent the four cardinal directions. Mesoamericans tended to add a second base-5 system to create a modified base-20 system.

A base-5 system (quinary) has been used in many cultures for counting. Plainly it is based on the number of digits on a human hand. It may also be regarded as a sub-base of other bases, such as base-10, base-20, and base-60.

A base-8 system (octal) was devised by the Yuki tribe of Northern California, who used the spaces between the fingers to count, corresponding to the digits one through eight. There is also linguistic evidence which suggests that the Bronze Age Proto-Indo Europeans (from whom most European and Indic languages descend) might have replaced a base-8 system (or a system which could only count up to 8) with a base-10 system. The evidence is that the word for 9, &quot;newm&quot;, is suggested by some to derive from the word for &quot;new&quot;, &quot;newo-&quot;, suggesting that the number 9 had been recently invented and called the &quot;new number&quot;.

Many ancient counting systems use five as a primary base, almost surely coming from the number of fingers on a person&#x27;s hand. Often these systems are supplemented with a secondary base, sometimes ten, sometimes twenty. In some African languages the word for five is the same as &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;fist&quot; (Dyola language of Guinea-Bissau, Banda language of Central Africa). Counting continues by adding 1, 2, 3, or 4 to combinations of 5, until the secondary base is reached. In the case of twenty, this word often means &quot;man complete&quot;. This system is referred to as &quot;quinquavigesimal&quot;. It is found in many languages of the Sudan region.

The Telefol language, spoken in Papua New Guinea, is notable for possessing a base-27 numeral system.

== Non-standard positional numeral systems ==

Interesting properties exist when the base is not fixed or positive and when the digit symbol sets denote negative values. There are many more variations. These systems are of practical and theoretic value to computer scientists.

Balanced ternary uses a base of 3 but the digit set is instead of {0,1,2}. The &quot;&quot; has an equivalent value of −1. The negation of a number is easily formed by switching the on the 1s. This system can be used to solve the balance problem, which requires finding a minimal set of known counter-weights to determine an unknown weight. Weights of 1, 3, 9, ..., 3&quot;n&quot; known units can be used to determine any unknown weight up to 1 + 3 + ... + 3&quot;n&quot; units. A weight can be used on either side of the balance or not at all. Weights used on the balance pan with the unknown weight are designated with , with 1 if used on the empty pan, and with 0 if not used. If an unknown weight &quot;W&quot; is balanced with 3 (31) on its pan and 1 and 27 (30 and 33) on the other, then its weight in decimal is 25 or 101 in balanced base-3. 

The factorial number system uses a varying radix, giving factorials as place values; they are related to Chinese remainder theorem and residue number system enumerations. This system effectively enumerates permutations. A derivative of this uses the Towers of Hanoi puzzle configuration as a counting system. The configuration of the towers can be put into 1-to-1 correspondence with the decimal count of the step at which the configuration occurs and vice versa.

== Non-positional positions ==
Each position does not need to be positional itself. Babylonian sexagesimal numerals were positional, but in each position were groups of two kinds of wedges representing ones and tens (a narrow vertical wedge | for the one and an open left pointing wedge ⟨ for the ten) — up to 5+9=14 symbols per position (i.e. 5 tens ⟨⟨⟨⟨⟨ and 9 ones ||||||||| grouped into one or two near squares containing up to three tiers of symbols, or a place holder (⑊) for the lack of a position). Hellenistic astronomers used one or two alphabetic Greek numerals for each position (one chosen from 5 letters representing 10–50 and/or one chosen from 9 letters representing 1–9, or a zero symbol).

<doc id="437063" wikidata="Q936656" url="?curid=437063" title="Cinchonism">
<text>Cinchonism is a pathological condition caused by an overdose of quinine or its natural source, cinchona bark. Quinine and its derivatives are used medically to treat malaria and lupus erythematosus. In much smaller amounts, quinine is an ingredient of tonic drinks, acting as a bittering agent. Cinchonism can occur from therapeutic doses of quinine, either from one or several large doses. Quinidine (a Class 1A anti-arrhythmic) can also cause cinchonism symptoms to develop with as little as a single dose.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of mild cinchonism (which may occur from standard therapeutic doses of quinine) include flushed and sweaty skin, ringing of the ears (tinnitus), blurred vision, impaired hearing, confusion, reversible high-frequency hearing loss, headache, abdominal pain, rashes, drug-induced lichenoid reaction (lichenoid photosensitivity), vertigo, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Large doses of quinine may lead to severe (but reversible) symptoms of cinchonism: skin rashes, deafness, somnolence, diminished visual acuity or blindness, anaphylactic shock, and disturbances in heart rhythm or conduction, and death from cardiotoxicity (damage to the heart). Quinine may also trigger a rare form of hypersensitivity reaction in malaria patients, termed blackwater fever, that results in massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and kidney failure. Most symptoms of cinchonism (except in severe cases) are reversible and disappear once quinine is withdrawn. Attempted suicide by intake of a large dose of quinine has caused irreversible tunnel vision and very severe visual impairment.

Patients treated with quinine may also suffer from low blood sugar, especially if it is administered intravenously, and hypotension (low blood pressure).

Quinine, like chloroquine, inactivates enzymes in the lysosomes of cells and has an anti-inflammatory effect, hence its use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, inactivation of these enzymes can also cause abnormal accumulation of glycogen and phospholipids in lysosomes, causing toxic myopathy. It is possible this action is the root cause of cinchonism.

<text>A hate group is a social group that advocates and practices hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other designated sector of society. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a hate group&#x27;s &quot;primary purpose is to promote animosity, hostility, and malice against persons belonging to a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin which differs from that of the members of the organization.&quot;

==Monitoring==
In the US, the FBI does not publish a list of hate groups, and it also says that &quot;investigations are only conducted when a threat or advocacy of force is made; when the group has the apparent ability to carry out the proclaimed act; and when the act would constitute a potential violation of federal law&quot;. The FBI maintains statistics on hate crimes.

Two private American non-profit organizations that monitor intolerance and hate groups are the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). They maintain lists of what they deem to be hate groups, supremacist groups and antisemitic, anti-government or extremist groups that have committed hate crimes. The SPLC&#x27;s definition of a &quot;hate group&quot; includes any group with beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people—particularly when the characteristics being maligned are immutable. However, at least for the SPLC, inclusion of a group in the list &quot;does not imply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity.&quot; According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, their list ranges from &quot;white supremacists to black nationalists, neo-Nazis to neo-Confederates.&quot;

The Canadian Anti-Hate Network is a nonprofit organization that monitors hate groups in Canada.

According to the SPLC, from 2000 to 2008, hate group activity saw a 50 percent increase in the US, with a total of 926 active groups. In 2019, the organization&#x27;s report showed a total of 1,020 hate groups, the highest number in 20 years, and a 7% increase from 2017 to 2018. The previous high was 1,018 in 2011, and the recent low point was 2014, when the list included 784 groups. A rise in white nationalist groups from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018 was the most significant increase in the 2019 report.

Since 2010 the term alt-right, short for &quot;alternative right&quot;, has come into usage. This broad term includes a range of people who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of forms of conservatism that may embrace implicit or explicit racism or white supremacy. The alt-right is described as being &quot;a weird mix of old-school neo-Nazis, conspiracy theorists, anti-globalists, and young right-wing internet trolls—all united in the belief that white male identity is under attack by multicultural, &quot;politically correct&quot; forces.&quot;

==Violence and hate crimes==

Four categories which are associated with hate groups&#x27; propensity for violence are: organizational capacity, organizational constituency, strategic connectivity, and structural arrangement. The larger an extremist group is and the longer it has existed, it is more prone to engage in violence. Regionally, hate groups which are based in the West and the Northeast are more likely to engage in violence than those hate groups which are based in the South. If a group has a charismatic leader, it is more likely to be violent. Groups that share conflict-based relationships with other groups are more likely to engage in extreme violence. The amount of ideological literature which a group publishes is linked to significant decreases in a group&#x27;s violent behavior, with more literature linked to lower levels of violence.

The California Association for Human Relations Organizations (CAHRO) asserts that hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) preach violence against racial, religious, sexual and other minorities in the United States. Joseph E. Agne argues that hate-motivated violence is a result of the successes of the civil rights movement, and he asserts that the KKK has resurfaced and new hate groups have formed. Agne argues that it is a mistake to underestimate the strength of the hate-violence movement, its apologists and its silent partners.

In the US, crimes that &quot;manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including the crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; aggravated assault; burglary; larceny-theft; motor vehicle theft; arson; simple assault; intimidation; and destruction, damage or vandalism of property&quot;, 
directed at the government, an individual, a business, or institution, involving hate groups and hate crimes, may be investigated as acts of domestic terrorism.

==Hate speech==
After World War II and The Holocaust, Germany found it necessary to criminalize Volksverhetzung (&quot;incitement to hatred&quot;) in order to prevent a resurgence of fascism.

Counter-terrorism expert defines verbal violence as &quot;the use of extreme language against an individual or a group that either implies a direct threat that physical force will be used against them, or is seen as an indirect call for others to use it.&quot; Sprinzak argues that verbal violence is often a substitute for real violence, and that the verbalization of hate has the potential to incite people who are incapable of distinguishing between real and verbal violence to engage in actual violence.

People tend to judge the offensiveness of hate speech on a gradient depending on how public the speech is and what group it targets. Although people&#x27;s opinions of hate speech are complex, they typically consider public speech targeting ethnic minorities to be the most offensive.

Historian Daniel Goldhagen, discussing antisemitic hate groups, argues that we should view verbal violence as &quot;an assault in its own right, having been intended to produce profound damage—emotional, psychological, and social—to the dignity and honor of the Jews. The wounds that people suffer by ... such vituperation ... can be as bad as ... [a] beating.&quot;

In the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Internet brought new international exposure to many organizations, including groups with beliefs such as white supremacy, neo-Nazism, homophobia, Holocaust denial and Islamophobia. Several white supremacist groups have founded websites dedicated to attacking their perceived enemies. In 1996, the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles asked Internet access providers to adopt a code of ethics that would prevent extremists from publishing their ideas online. In 1996, the European Commission formed the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRAX), a pan-European group which was tasked to &quot;investigate and, using legal means, stamp out the current wave of racism on the Internet.&quot;

==Religious hate groups==
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated several Christian groups as hate groups, including the American Family Association, the Family Research Council, Abiding Truth Ministries, American Vision, the Chalcedon Foundation, the Dove World Outreach Center, the Traditional Values Coalition and the Westboro Baptist Church. Some conservatives have criticized the SPLC for its inclusion of certain Christian groups, such as the Family Research Council, on its list.

The SPLC classifies the Nation of Islam (NOI) as a hate group under the black separatist category and the Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge (ISUPK) as a hate group under the black supremacist category. Members of the NOI believe that a black scientist named Yakub created a race of , who are considered the progenitors of White people, on the Greek island of Patmos. Historically a black-only group, White adherents now form a small part of the NOI membership. Alongside the ISUPK, numerous other sects and organizations within the Black Hebrew Israelite movement expound extremist, black supremacist, religious antisemitic, and anti-White racist beliefs, as well as homophobic, transphobic, and sexist beliefs.

The White supremacist religious group which is currently named the Creativity Movement (formerly the World Church of the Creator), led by Matthew F. Hale, is associated with violence and bigotry. The Aryan Nations is another religiously-based White supremacist hate group.

The Westboro Baptist Church is considered a hate group by multiple sources and the WBC is monitored as such by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. The church has been involved in actions against gay people since at least 1991, when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at Gage Park six blocks northwest of the church. In addition to conducting anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets celebrity funerals and public events. Protests have also been held against Jews and Roman Catholics, and some protests have included WBC members stomping on the American flag or flying the flag upside down on a flagpole. The church also has made statements such as &quot;thank God for dead soldiers&quot;, &quot;God blew up the troops&quot;, and &quot;God hates America.&quot; The church has faced several accusations of brainwashing and has been criticized as a cult because of its provocative stance against homosexuality and the United States, and it has been condemned by many mainstream LGBT rights opponents as well as by LGBT rights supporters.

==Misogynistic hate groups==

Misogynist hate groups which target women, particularly those groups whose members mostly consist of young men who include pickup artists, incels and hardline anti-woman groups, are sources of concern to some experts. Using recruitment techniques which are similar to those which are used by far-right extremist groups, they target teenagers and vulnerable young men, their recruitment tactics include the use of methods which are akin to grooming. UK author Laura Bates believes that some of these groups should be classified as misogynist terrorist groups. The Proud Boys, which, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its misogynistic rhetoric, has been designated as a domestic terrorist group in Canada.

==Internet hate groups==

Traditionally, hate groups recruited members and spread extremist messages by word of mouth, or through the distribution of flyers and pamphlets. In contrast, the Internet allows hate group members from all over the world to engage in real-time conversations. The Internet has been a boon for hate groups in terms of promotion, recruitment and expansion of their base to include younger audiences. An Internet hate group does not have to be part of a traditional faction such as the Ku Klux Klan.

While many hate sites are explicitly antagonistic or violent, others may appear patriotic or benign, and this façade may contribute to the appeal of the groups. Hate group websites work towards the following goals: to educate group members and the public, to encourage participation, to claim a divine calling and privilege, and to accuse out-groups (e.g. the government or the media). Groups that work effectively towards these goals via an online presence tend to strengthen their sense of identity, decrease the threat levels from out-groups, and recruit more new members.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), in its 2009 &quot;iReport&quot;, identified more than 10,000 problematic hate and terrorist websites and other Internet postings. The report includes hate websites, social networks, blogs, newsgroups, YouTube and other video sites. The findings illustrate that as the Internet continues to grow, extremists find new ways to seek validation of their hateful agendas and recruit members.

Creators of hate pages and groups on Facebook choose their target, set up their page or group, and then recruit members. Anyone can create a Facebook group and invite followers to post comments, add pictures and participate in discussion boards. A Facebook page is similar, with the exception that one must &quot;like&quot; the page in order to become a member. Because of the ease of creating and joining such groups, many so-called hate groups exist only in cyberspace.
United Patriots Front, an internet-based Australian far-right anti-immigration and neo-nazi organization formed in 2015 has been described as a hate group.

==Psychology of hate groups==
Hateful intergroup conflict may be motivated by &quot;in-group love,&quot; a desire to positively contribute to the group to which one belongs, or &quot;out-group hate,&quot; a desire to injure a foreign group. Both individuals and groups are more motivated by &quot;in-group love&quot; than &quot;out-group hate,&quot; even though both motivations might advance a group&#x27;s status. This preference is especially salient when a group is not situated in a competitive position against another. This partiality towards cooperative behavior suggests that intergroup conflict might decline if group members devoted more energy to positive in-group improvements than to out-group competition. Groups formed around a set of moral codes are more likely than non-morality-based groups to exhibit &quot;out-group hate&quot; as a response to their especially strong sense of &quot;in-group love.&quot;

Intergroup threat occurs when one group&#x27;s interests threaten another group&#x27;s goals and well-being. Intergroup threat theories provide a framework for intergroup biases and aggression.

One type of intergroup threat theory, realistic group conflict theory, addresses competition between groups by positing that when two groups are competing for limited resources, one group&#x27;s potential success is at odds with the other&#x27;s interests, which leads to negative out-group attitudes. If groups have the same goal, their interactions will be positive, but opposing goals will worsen intergroup relations. Intergroup conflict may increase in-group unity, leading to a larger disparity and more conflict between groups.

Symbolic threat theory proposes that intergroup bias and conflict result from conflicting ideals, not from perceived competition or opposing goals. Biases based on symbolic threat tend to be stronger predictors of practical behavior towards out-groups than biases based on realistic threat.

Realistic group conflict theory and symbolic threat theory are, in some cases, compatible. Integrated-threat theory recognizes that conflict can arise from a combination of intergroup dynamics and classifies threats into four types: realistic threat, symbolic threat, intergroup anxiety, and negative stereotypes. Intergroup threat theories provide a framework for intergroup biases and aggression. Intergroup anxiety refers to a felt uneasiness around members of other groups, which is predictive of biased attitudes and behaviors. Negative stereotypes are also correlated with these behaviors, causing threat based on negative expectations about an out-group.

According to the 7-stage hate model, a hate group, if unimpeded, passes through seven successive stages. In the first four stages, hate groups vocalize their beliefs and in the last three stages, they act on their beliefs. Factors that contribute to a group&#x27;s likelihood to act include the vulnerability of its members as well as its reliance on symbols and mythologies. This model points to a transition period that exists between verbal violence and acting out that violence, separating hardcore haters from rhetorical haters. Thus, hate speech is seen as a prerequisite of hate crimes, and as a condition of their possibility.

Hate group intervention is most possible if a group has not yet passed from the speech to the action stage, and interventions on immature hate groups are more effective than those that are firmly established. Intervention and rehabilitation is most effective when the one investigating a hate group can identify and deconstruct personal insecurities of group members, which in turn contribute to the weakness of the group. Perhaps most critical to combating group hate is to prevent the recruitment of new members by supporting those who are most susceptible, especially children and youth, in developing a positive self-esteem and a humanized understanding of out-groups.

==Conceptual criticism==
The concept of hate groups has been criticised as being arbitrarily and incoherently defined, as hatred can be promoted against a theoretically unlimited number of groups yet only a select few protected characteristics are included. Choosing to designate specific groups as hate groups but not others thus becomes a rhetorical device to pathologize certain groups as deviant rather than a coherent concept. Hate groups are tracked by groups such as the SPLC and ADL, but the lack of a clear definition means these measures run the risk of simply being the opinion of private organisations.

<text>The Nuristanis are an ethnic group native to the Nuristan Province of northeastern Afghanistan and Chitral District of northwestern Pakistan. Their languages comprise the Nuristani branch of Indo-Iranian languages.

In the mid-1890s, after the establishment of the Durand Line when Afghanistan and the British Indian Empire reached an agreement regarding the Indo-Afghan border as the region of Kafiristan became part of the Great Game and for a period of time, Emir Abdur Rahman Khan conducted a military campaign to secure the eastern regions and followed up his conquest by imposition of Islam; the region thenceforth being known as &quot;Nuristan&quot;, the &quot;Land of Light&quot;. Before their conversion, the Nuristanis practised a form of ancient Hinduism. Non-Muslim religious practices endure in Nuristan today to some degree as folk customs. In their native rural areas, they are often farmers, herders, and dairymen.

The Nuristan region has been a prominent location for war, which has led to the death of many indigenous Nuristanis. Nuristan has also received abundance of settlers from the surrounding Afghan regions due to the borderline vacant location.

== Pre-Islamic religion ==

Noted linguist Richard Strand, an authority on Hindu Kush languages, observed the following about pre-Islamic Nuristani religion:

&quot;Before their conversion to Islâm the Nuristânis practiced a form of ancient Hinduism, infused with accretions developed locally&quot;.

They acknowledged a number of human-like deities who lived in the unseen Deity World (Kâmviri d&#x27;e lu; cf. Sanskrit deva lok&#x27;a-).

Mitch Weiss and Kevin Maurer describe the Nuristanis of having traditionally practising a &quot;primitive&quot; form of Hinduism, up until the late nineteenth century, before their conversions to Islam.

Certain deities were revered only in one community or tribe, but one was universally revered as the creator: the Hindu god Yama Râja called imr&#x27;o in Kâmviri. There is a creator god, appearing under various names, as lord of the nether world and of heaven: Yama Rājan, or Māra (&#x27;death&#x27;, Nuristani), or &quot;Dezau&quot; (ḍezáw) whose name is derived from Indo-European *dheiǵh- i.e. &quot;to form&quot; (Kati Nuristani dez &quot;to create&quot;, CDIAL 14621); Dezauhe is also called by the Persian term &quot;Khodaii&quot;. There are a number of other deities, semi-gods and spirits. The Kalash pantheon is thus one of the few living representatives of Indo-European religion.

They believed in many deities, whose names resembled those of Iranian and old Vedic sources. There was a supreme deity named Mara or Imra, plus a multitude of lesser gods and goddesses known locally as Mandi or Moni, Wushum or Shomde, Gish or Giwish, Bagisht, Indr, Züzum, Disani, Kshumai or Kime etc. According to Michael Witzel, some of these gods, especially Disani, Moni, and Gish, have direct parallels in Shinto, the native religion of Japan, indicating a shared history dating back to 2000 BCE.

Each village and clan had its guardian deity, with shamans advising those seeking help and priests officiating at religious services. The cult centered on the sacrifice of animals, mostly goats.

The area extending from modern Nuristan to Kashmir was known as &quot;Peristan&quot;, a vast area containing a host of Nuristani cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by Buddhist states and societies which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilous according to reports of Chinese pilgrims Fa-hsien and Sung Yun. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavily isolated. The Islamization of the nearby Badakhshan began in the 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The Kalash people of lower Chitral are the last surviving heirs of the area. 

The region was called Kafiristan because while the surrounding populations were converted to Islam, the people in this region retained their traditional religion, and were thus known as &quot;Kafirs&quot; to the Muslims. The Arabic word &quot;Kufr&quot; means disbelief and the related word &quot;Kafir&quot; means one who does not believe in Islam. The majority were converted to Islam during Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s rule around 1895. The province is now known as Nuristan and the people as Nuristanis. However, among the rural population many old customs and beliefs like occasional production of wine have continued.

== History ==
In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great encountered them and finally defeated them after they put up a stubborn and prolonged resistance, describing them as being distinct culturally and religiously from other peoples of the region.

Nuristanis were formerly classified into &quot;Siah-Posh (&quot;black-robed&quot;) and &quot;Safed-Posh (&quot;white-robed&quot;)/Lall-Posh (&quot;Red-Robed&quot;). Timur fought with and was humbled by the Siah-Posh. Babur advised not to tangle with them. Genghis Khan passed by them.

In 1014, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked them:
=== Timur&#x27;s encounter with Katirs/Kators ===
The first reference to Siah-Posh Kafirs occurs in Timur&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan in 1398 CE. Timur&#x27;s autobiography (Tuzak-i-Timuri) amply attests that he had battled both with the Katirs as well as the Kam sections of the Siah-Posh (black-robed) Kafirs of the Hindukush mountains. Timur invaded Afghanistan in March 1398. On the basis of local complaints of ill-treatment and extortions filed by the Muslims against the Kafirs, Timur personally attacked the &quot;Kators&quot; of the Siah-Posh group located north-east of Kabul in eastern Afghanistan. The Kators left their fort &quot;Najil&quot; and took refuge at the top of the hill. Timur razed the fort to ground, burnt their houses and surrounded the hill where the Kator had collected for shelter. The relic of the historic fort is said to still exist a little north to Najil in the form of a structure known as &quot;Timur Hissar&quot; (Timur&#x27;s Fort). After a tough fight, some of the Kators were defeated and were instantly put to death while the others held out against heavy odds for three days. Timur offered them &quot;death&quot; or &quot;Islam&quot;. They chose the latter, but soon recanted and attacked the regiment of Muslim soldiers during night. The latter being on guard, fought back, killed numerous Kators and took 150 as prisoners and put them to death afterwards.
Next day, Timur ordered his troops to advance on all four sides to &quot;kill all men, enslave the women and children and plunder or lay waste all their property&quot;. In his autobiography called &quot;Tuzak-i-Timuri&quot;, Timur proudly boasts of the &quot;towers of the skulls of the Kators which he built on the mountain in the auspicious month of Ramazan A.H. 800&quot; (1300 CE)

=== Timur&#x27;s encounter with Kam Kafirs ===
Again, according to Timur&#x27;s autobiography (&quot;Tuzak-i-Timuri&quot;), a military division of ten thousand Muslim soldiers was sent against the Siah-Posh (Kam) Kafirs under the command of General Aglan Khan to either slay these infidels or else to convert them into Islam. Tuzak-i-Timuri frankly admits that the regiment was badly routed by a small number of Siah-Posh Kafirs. The Muslim forces had to flee from the battle-field leaving their horses and armour. Another detachment had to be sent under Muhammad Azad which fought gallantly and recovered the horses and the armour lost by General Aglan and came back home, leaving the Siah-Posh alone.

Timur does not boast of any killings or imprisonment of the Siah-Poshes as he does for the Katirs and numerous other communities of India proper. He gives no further details of his conflict with the Siah-Poshes in his Tuzak-i-Timuri after this encounter, which suggests the outcome of the fight against the Siah-Poshes was very costly and shameful for Timur.

Other references to these Kafirs are made in the fifteenth and later in sixteenth century during the Mughal period.

In 1839, the Kafirs sent a deputation to Sir William Macnaghten in Jalalabad claiming relationship with the fair skinned British troops who had invaded the country

=== Settlement in Chitral ===
At the time of the Afghan conquest of Kafiristan, a small number of Kom and Kati Kafirs fled east to Chitral (modern Pakistan) where they were allowed to settle by the Mehtar. There they practised their faith for a few more decades, before finally converting to Islam as well. The final known non-converted Kafir was settled in a Chitrali village known as Urtsun. This Kafir&#x27;s name was Chanlu, and he converted in 1938, several months after being interviewed about the cosmology of the Kati.

In Chitral, the Nuristanis are known either as Bashgalis (as most migrated from a valley of Nuristan called Bashgal in the Chitrali Khowar language), or alternatively as Sheikhan (a generic term for recent converts to Islam). The exact population size of Nuristanis in Chitral is unknown, but members of the community estimate that they number at least 12 000. All of them are speakers of the Kamkata-vari language, also known locally as Sheikhani.

=== Pre-1895 Kafir society ===
Prior to 1895, the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush were classified into two groups: the Siah-posh (black clad) and the Safed-posh (white clad) Kafirs, also known as the Lal-posh (red-clad), so-called because of the colour of the robes they wore. But the British investigator George Scott Robertson who visited Kafiristan and studied the Kafirs for about two years (1889–1891) improved upon the old classification by recognising that the Safed-posh Kafirs were actually members of several separate clans, viz, the Waigulis, Presungulis or Viron, and the Ashkuns. The later three groups of the Kafirs used to be collectively known as Sped-Posh Kafirs.

The term Siah-posh Kafirs used to designate the dominant group of Hindu Kush Kafirs inhabiting the Bashgal Valley. The Siah-posh Kafirs have sometimes been confused with Kalasha people of the neighbouring Chitral region in Pakistan.

The Siah-Posh tribe was divided into Siah-posh Katirs or Kamtoz, Siah-posh Mumans or Madugals, Siah-posh Kashtoz or Kashtan, Siah-posh Gourdesh or Istrat, and Siah-posh Kams or Kamoze. The Siah-posh Katirs were further divided into the Katirs, who occupied twelve villages of the lower Bashgul (Kam) country, the Kti or Katawar, who lived in two villages in the Kti Valley, the Kulam, and the Ramguli, the most numerous group, living in twenty four villages in the Ramgul Valley, in the westernmost part of Kafiristan on the Afghan frontier.

All Siah-posh groups of Kafirs were regarded as of common origin. They all had a common dress and customs and spoke closely related dialects of Kati. Nicholas Barrington et al. reported that the Waigulis and Presungulis referred to all Siah-posh Kafirs as Katirs.

While the Kamtoz of the lower Bashgul valley were the most numerous, the Kam of the upper Bashgul valley were the most intractable and fierce and dreaded for their military prowess.

==== Origin hypotheses ====
* Some earlier writers had speculated and propagated the myth that the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush may have descended from the army of Alexander the Great. The Pakistani Tourist Bureau still continues to propagate that the peoples in the mountains are descendants of soldiers from the army of Alexander but Greek descent of Kafirs has been discounted by H. W. Bellew, George Scott Robertson and many later scholars. However some other people do believe in their authenticity of this tale that some of the Kalash themselves claim as being descendants of Alexander&#x27;s army. This list of people who propagate the Kalash&#x27;s ancestry claim is true includes Sir George Scott Robertson, and Eric S. Margolis.
* The Siah-Posh Kafirs themselves claim to have descended from certain Koresh (&quot;Gurashi/Gorish or Goraish&quot;) a name linked to Quraysh tribe of Arabs but this is merely a fashionable fiction. H. W. Bellew relates name Gurish/Gorish or Koresh of the Kafirs accounts to Kurush and writes that Koresh or Kurush is the national designation of the Kafir tribes of Kafiristan, north of Laghman. Bellew further speculates that Koresh (or Kurush) may have been the family name of the Cyrus, king of Persia who was born in the Cabul country. Keruch, according to Bellew is the name of a Rajput clan which may have been adopted into the Rajput nation though of different race and descent. Thus, Bellew seem to relate Siah-Posh Kafirs to the Iranians.
* George Scott Robertson also rejects Greek origin of the Kafirs. According to him, the present dominant clans of Kafirstan viz. the Katirs (Kamtoz), the Kams (Kamoz) and the Wais are mainly descended from the ancient Indian population of eastern Afghanistan who refused to embrace Islam in tenth century, and fled for refuge from victorious Muslims to the hilly of Kafirstan. There they probably found other races already settled, whom they vanquished, drove away, or enslaved, or with whom they amalgamated.
* According to Donald Wilber and other recent writers, anthropological data suggests that the Kafirs are not the tenth century migrants to Kafirstan but are a remnant of the original population of the area which according to some was Dravidian but according to the others Indo-Aryan. They appear to be &quot;a mixture&quot; of an extremely ancient element related to oldest known population of central Himalayas (&quot;the Presuns&quot;), the element with resemblance to the Kurds and a type with Nordic and Dinaric traits (&quot;the Siah-Posh/Wai groups&quot;) which goes back to the ancient prototype of these races preserved in the midst of Indo-Aryan ascendancy.

=== Soviet–Afghan War (1979-1989) ===
General Issa Nuristani was second in command following the King during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, being the commander of the 1st Central Army Corps. Before his assassination, General Issa called the Nuristani people in a &quot;Jihad&quot; against the Soviet Army and the Afghan Armed Forces. Led by the Koms tribe, the Nuristani were the first citizens of Afghanistan to revolt against Saur Revolution in 1978. They played an important role in the conquering of some provinces, including Kunar, Nangarhar, Badakhshan, and Panjshir. Thereafter, Nuristan remained a scene of some of the bloodiest guerrilla fighting with the Soviet forces from 1979 through 1989. Following the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in 1989, the Mawlawi Ghulam Rabbani was declared as governor of the Kunar Province. The Nuristanis inspired others to fight and contributed to the demise of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in 1992.

== Genetics ==
In a 2012 research on Y-chromosomes of five Nuristani samples, three were found to belong to the Haplogroup R1a, and one each in R2a and J2a.

== Tribes ==

Most Nuristanis are from the Kata Family and Janaderi Branch. However, there are other Nuristani tribes as well, some of the Kata of Janaderi people live in Ozhor (now Karimabad), Gobor, Buburat, Ayun, Broze and Mastuj. There is a very popular rock associated with this tribe located in Karimabad (Juwara) called &quot;kata bont&quot; (Kata is the name of the tribe; &quot;bont&quot; meaning &quot;stone&quot; in the Chitrali language).

The Nuristani do not have a formal tribal structure as the Pashtuns do, however they do designate themselves by the names of the local regions they are from. 

In total, there are 35 such designations: five from the north–south valleys and 30 from the east–west valley.

Some of these tribes include:
* Askunu
* Dungulio
* Gramsana
* Jench
* Kata
* Kom
* Kshto
* Mumo
* Sanu

<doc id="437074" wikidata="Q3161213" url="?curid=437074" title="James Kochalka">
<text>James Kochalka (born May 26, 1967, in Springfield, Vermont) is an American comic book artist, writer, animator, and rock musician. His comics are noted for their blending of the real and the surreal. Largely autobiographical, Kochalka&#x27;s cartoon expression of the world around him includes such real-life characters as his wife, children, cat, friends and colleagues, but always filtered through his own observations and flights of whimsy. In March 2011 he was declared the cartoonist laureate of Vermont, serving a term of three years.

==Early life and early career==
Kochalka grew up in Springfield, Vermont. He attended the Maryland Institute College of Art and has an MFA in painting.

His first published comics work was around 1994. He has cited cartoonist Daniel Clowes as being a key inspiration in leading him &quot;towards a whole world of comics that [he] never knew existed.&quot; Kochalka strongly believes that simplicity is desirable in comics and says that &quot;craft is the enemy&quot;, and has had public debates in print and online with other cartoonists who disagree with his position. Kochalka&#x27;s &quot;Craft Is the Enemy&quot; essays were collected in the 2005 book &quot;The Cute Manifesto&quot;.

==Career==
Kochalka spent six years working in a Chinese restaurant in Winooski, Vermont, before leaving to devote his full energy to cartooning and music. His song &quot;Hockey Monkey&quot;, recorded with the band The Zambonis, was the theme song for the Fox series &quot;The Loop&quot;.

===Comics and graphic novels===
Comic book writer/artist Frank Miller told SuicideGirls that he is a &quot;big fan of James Kochalka,&quot; predicting Kochalka is &quot;going to become more important and it&#x27;s going to be fun watching that happen. He reminds me of me when I was six years old and I came into my mother&#x27;s kitchen with a bunch of sheets of typing paper folded over and stapled in the middle that were covered with drawings and I said &#x27;Mom this is what I&#x27;m going to do for the rest of my life.&#x27; I&#x27;ve learned a lot from people like Kochalka because they do stuff that shouldn&#x27;t work but does.&quot;

Kochalka is prolific in his comics work. He told an interviewer in 2002 that he had created 2,000 pages of comics by the time he completed high school. His comics have earned him four Ignatz Awards (Outstanding Minicomic 1997, Outstanding Series 2002, Outstanding Online Comic 2003 and 2004), a Harvey Award (Best Online Comic 2006), and multiple nominations for the Eisner Award. His work is characterized by a simple drawing style, bright colors, and frequent appearances by cats, robots, elves, and monkeys.

Among his most widely disseminated works is a four-page story, &quot;Hulk vs. the Rain&quot;, that originally appeared in black-and-white in an unauthorized alternative comic called &quot;Coober Skeber&quot;. The story was later redrawn in color by Kochalka for inclusion in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; 2001 Annual. The first issue of his comic &quot;SuperF*ckers&quot; sold approximately 2,500 copies through Diamond Distributing. In 2002, Kochalka said that all 5,000 copies of the first printing of the &quot;Monkey vs. Robot&quot; graphic novel had sold out. There has since been a second printing, and in an interview in August 2006 Kochalka said that over 10,000 copies of &quot;Monkey vs. Robot&quot; have been sold to date.

Kochalka created the comic &quot;Impy And Wormer&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;.

In July 2012 Kochalka won the Eisner Award for his book &quot;Dragon Puncher 2: Dragon Puncher Island&quot;.

Kochalka&#x27;s two primary publishers are Top Shelf Productions and Alternative Comics. He has also published numerous short stories in comics anthologies, self-published his own mini-comics, and published graphic novels through other publishers such as Black Eye, Slave Labor Graphics and Highwater Books. He also makes the SpongeFunnies in the &quot;SpongeBob Comics&quot; series of comics.

====American Elf====
For more than 14 years, from October 26, 1998 – December 31, 2012, Kochalka kept a daily diary comic strip. These strips have been published by Top Shelf Productions, first as &quot;The Sketchbook Diaries&quot; and then in collected form as &quot;American Elf&quot;. Kochalka told &quot;The Onion&quot; that he wrote the first diary entry while traveling by plane to San Diego Comic-Con. Kochalka&#x27;s friend and fellow cartoonist Brian Ralph was working on his comics on the flight, and Kochalka was inspired to begin cartooning on the plane as well. Kochalka created diary strips during the week of the convention, and committed to doing a diary strip every day. The strip finally ended on December 31, 2012, with one final epilogue-style strip titled &quot;Am I alive?&quot; published on March 23, 2013. Additionally, Kochalka published a tribute entry to his cat, Spandy, after her death in February 2014.

The book &quot;American Elf&quot; is a collection of Kochalka&#x27;s daily diary strips, released in a large edition by Top Shelf Productions in Summer 2004, compiling five years of the daily diary strips and other supplemental material. A second volume was released in early 2007, collecting years six and seven of the daily strips in full color. A third volume followed in November 2008, collecting the years 2006 and 2007 in color.

Beginning in December 2007, Kochalka made all of his daily diary strip archives free for all readers; previously the archives had only been accessible to paying subscribers, with only the newest strip available for free. Under the relaunched &quot;American Elf Supersite,&quot; all the archived strips dating back to 2002 were free for all readers, while paying subscribers receive access to other comics and MP3s. Kochalka reported on his blog that the site had received around 200,000 hits as a result of the change. Subsequently he opened the archives all the way back to the strip&#x27;s beginning in 1998. As of 2017, those archives are no longer available, as the bulk of Kochalka&#x27;s sketchbook diaries are sold in digital editions by Kochalka&#x27;s publisher Top Shelf Productions.

====SuperFuckers====

SuperFuckers (censored as &quot;SuperF*ckers&quot;, &quot;SuperF***ers&quot;, or &quot;Super&#x27;F&#x27;-ers&quot;) is an adult-rated comic book series published by Top Shelf Productions between 2005 and 2007. The series revolves around a collection of crude and rude superheroes who never actually do any superhero work. Frederator Studios approached Kochalka with the possibility of producing an animated cartoon based on the comics. After pitching the show around to various cable television networks, Frederator produced the series for distribution on its YouTube funded partner channel Cartoon Hangover. The series premiered on November 30, 2012. The first season consists of twelve five-minute episodes and follows closely to the comics.
The series features David Faustino in the lead role of Jack Krak, as well as Maria Bamford, Jaleel White, Veronica Belmont, Phil Morris, and Jeff B. Davis.
The series was directed by Fran Krause, written by Kochalka, and features the music of Anthony Davis and Dustin Pilkington of Best Fwends.

====Glorkian Warrior====
Glorkian Warrior is a series of books oriented at a younger audience. created by Kochalka and published by FirstSecond. The first (of three) is called &quot;Glorkian Warrior Delivers a Pizza&quot;. The second graphic novel, &quot;Glorkian Warrior Eats Adventure Pie&quot; was released in March 2015 and the third book &quot;The Glorkian Warrior and the Mustache of Destiny&quot; came out a year later.

The character was created by Kochalka and along with Pixeljam was made into a videogame called &quot;Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork&quot;

===Video games===
Pixeljam Games released &quot;Glorkian Warrior: Trials of Glork&quot; for iOS in March 2014, and subsequently for Android, PC and Mac. Kochalka and Pixeljam funded the project with a Kickstarter beginning in 2010.

===Teaching===
Kochalka was an instructor at the Center for Cartoon Studies, a cartooning school in White River Junction, Vermont that was founded by cartoonist James Sturm. Kochalka is part of the &quot;Little Idiot Collective,&quot; a group of artists assembled by the musician Moby.

===Music===

Kochalka&#x27;s band, James Kochalka Superstar, has released nine albums.

&quot;Spread Your Evil Wings and Fly&quot; was completed some time before its release in the fall of 2005; an online petition was launched to convince Kochalka&#x27;s record label Rykodisc to release the CD. Over 500 people signed the petition demanding the album&#x27;s release. It was followed by &quot;Digital Elf&quot; in 2009, &quot;Good Morning, Glorkian Warrior&quot; in 2015, &quot;How To Tie A Tie On The Internet&quot; in 2018, and &quot;Eggs&quot; in 2019. Additionally, two of Kochalka&#x27;s other recordings have been released since, &quot;Monkey Vs. Robot&quot; and &quot;Why Is The Sky Blue&quot;. Both hold copyrights from 1997 and 2005, respectively, and are listed on Spotify with those release dates.

Virtually all of Kochalka&#x27;s CDs come packaged with his cartoons in the accompanying pamphlets, in some cases using the pamphlet as a full-length mini-comic.

Kochalka&#x27;s best-known musical works are probably the songs &quot;Pizza Rocket&quot; and &quot;Hockey Monkey&quot;, the music videos for which were shown on Nickelodeon&#x27;s animation showcase series &quot;KaBlam!&quot;.

Rolling Stone named &quot;Britney&#x27;s Silver Can&quot; one of &quot;The 100 Best Songs of 2006&quot;.

The song &quot;Hockey Monkey&quot;, which James co-authored with The Zambonis, was used as theme song of the Fox comedy, &quot;The Loop&quot;.

Kochalka was also in the band Jazzin&#x27; Hell, and contributed vocals as the character Frank Poole in the rock opera CD, &quot;ODYSSEY!&quot;

Moby sang back-up vocals on a seven-inch single from Kochalka&#x27;s former band Jazzin&#x27; Hell, an outtake of which resurfaced on Kochalka&#x27;s album &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust Whitey&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kochalka lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Amy and their two sons, Eli and Oliver.

<doc id="437075" wikidata="Q1018444" url="?curid=437075" title="Bwiti">
<text>Bwiti is a spiritual discipline of the forest-dwelling Punu people and Mitsogo peoples of Gabon (where it is recognized as one of three official religions) and by the Fang people of Gabon. Modern Bwiti incorporates animism, ancestor worship, and in some cases, Christianity, into a syncretistic belief system.

Bwiti practitioners use the psychedelic, dissociative root bark of the &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot; plant, specially cultivated for the religion, to promote radical spiritual growth, to stabilize community and family structure, to meet religious requirements, and to resolve pathological problems. The root bark has been consumed for hundreds of years in a Bwiti rite of passage ceremony, as well as in initiation rites and acts of healing. The experience yields complex visions and insights anticipated to be valuable to the initiate and the chapel.

==Liturgy==
===Intoxicants in liturgy===
Taking Iboga brings both open and closed-eye visions which can be made stronger by darkness, ambiance, and suggestion. Following the visions, users experience an introspective mindset in which they often recount past experiences in life. Difficulty sleeping, nausea, and vomiting sometimes last until the day after consumption.

===Rites===
Bwiti ceremonies are led by a spiritual leader called &quot;N&#x27;ganga&quot; who is a very important member of the community and has extensive knowledge of traditional healing practices, hexes, and spells. The crucial rite of Bwiti is the initiation ceremony, when young Gabonese women and men take iboga for the first time in the huts specific to each gender to become members of the spiritual practice. There are many ceremonies at different times of the year to give homage to the ancestors. Special ceremonies may be held to heal sick persons or drive out malevolent spirits.

During some ceremonies, a traditional torch made of bark and tree sap, the mupeto, is burned. Music and dance are central to the Bwiti tradition. Participants sing and play drums and shakers. Some traditions use the Ngombi harp, while other use the traditional Mongongo. The N&#x27;ganga and other participants usually dress in red, black, and white cloth. They may wear skirts of raffia material and small shells or beads. Animal skins, such as Genet fur, are often worn. The iboga root may be made into a tea or more often taken in the form of scrapings. Ceremonies usually begin at night and may last for days since the effects of doses of the drug of the size employed in such ceremonies are particularly long lasting.

==== Initiation ritual ====
The &quot;Bwiti&quot; religion originated among the Pygmies, who discovered the effects of consuming the second layer of the iboga root. Pygmies – mainly the Mbenge ethnic group in Gabon (Aka, Gyele, Bongo, Baka and Kola groups) – have observed the special effect of iboga in mountain gorillas that chewed the root. After small doses of crushed iboga root, the Pygmy hunters were able to cover a noticeably longer distance, carry a heavier load and not sleep for several days. Larger doses of iboga lead to significant hallucinations, and the dose used for the Bwiti initiation causes temporary unconsciousness. Exceeding this dose – in relation to the weight and health of the person – will cause death.

The initiation ritual is important for the Gabonese: it is during this ritual that they are initiated into the Bwiti religion and consume iboga for the first time in their lives. After successfully completing the initiation ritual, they can consume iboga throughout their life, whether during festivities, treatment, or for their personal spiritual development. The initiation ritual in Gabon usually takes three to seven days (depending on the area). The common characteristics of the initiation ritual in various areas are monotonous music with a repetitive melody, purification, vomiting, fasting, censing and receiving a drug from the iboga root. The initiation ritual is sometimes called simply after the shrub the crushed root of which is consumed – iboga.

In Gabon, Bwiti is practiced separately as an independent religion, but often together with Catholic Christianity in a syncretized form.

====Sects and Rites====
The term &quot;Bwiti&quot; is often misrepresented in the west. This is likely due to a lack of information dissemination (considering it is an oral tradition), appropriation and modification of rites amongst the different populations, and purposeful disinformation to keep rites secret. The Pygmy peoples are often cited as the origin of Bwiti, or at least of the use of Iboga in a ritualistic context.

==Recognition==
Bwiti is one of Gabon&#x27;s official traditions. Some sects are influenced by Christianity, and include the use of the Christian calendar.

<text>The GMHC (formerly Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis) is a New York City–based non-profit, volunteer-supported and community-based AIDS service organization whose mission statement is to &quot;end the AIDS epidemic and uplift the lives of all affected.&quot; Founded in 1982, it is often billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s oldest AIDS service organization,&quot; as well as the &quot;nation&#x27;s oldest HIV/AIDS service organization.&quot;

==History==

===1980s===

In early 1981, reports began surfacing in San Francisco and New York City that a rare form of cancer called Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma was affecting young gay men. In response, 80 men gathered in New York writer Larry Kramer&#x27;s apartment on August 11, 1981, to discuss the issue of &quot;gay cancer&quot; and to begin organizing efforts to raise money for research.

In January 1982, Nathan Fain, Lawrence D. Mass, Paul Popham, Paul Rapoport and Edmund White again met with Larry Kramer at his home and founded Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis. GMHC took its name from the fact that the earliest men who fell victim to AIDS in the early 1980s were gay. The first meeting was held in the Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village. They organized the formal tax-exempt entity, which was incorporated on June 30, 1982. At the time, it was the largest volunteer AIDS organization in the world. Paul Popham was chosen as the president.

 Rodger McFarlane began a crisis counseling hotline that originated on his own home telephone, which ultimately became one of the organization&#x27;s most effective tools for sharing information about AIDS. He was named director of GMHC in 1982, helping create a more formal structure for the nascent organization, which had no funding or offices when he took on the role. GMHC operated out of a couple of rooms for offices in a rooming house at 318 West 22nd Street in Chelsea owned by Mel Cheren of West End Records.

Popham&#x27;s dedication to combating the AIDS crisis and his collaboration with stakeholders worldwide emphasized his commitment to public health. Upon receiving outreach from Gordon Price, a co-founder of AIDS Vancouver, Popham traveled to Vancouver, on the west coast of Canada, offering his invaluable expertise. This pivotal partnership culminated in the inception of the inaugural AIDS Information Forum on March 12, 1983. Notably, Popham&#x27;s knowledge shared during this forum was immortalized on film, signifying a momentous stride in the nascent endeavors to tackle the epidemic.

Larry Kramer wrote that by the time of McFarlane&#x27;s death, &quot;the GMHC is essentially what he started: crisis counseling, legal aid, volunteers, the buddy system, social workers&quot; as part of an organization that serves more than 15,000 people affected by HIV and AIDS. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; after McFarlane&#x27;s death in May 2009, Kramer described how &quot;single-handedly Rodger took this struggling ragtag group of really frightened and mostly young men, found us an office and set up all the programs.&quot;

Kramer resigned in 1983 due to his many disagreements with the other founders. From that time on, his public comments and posture toward GMHC were negative, if not hostile. Kramer&#x27;s play &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; is a roman à clef of his involvement with the organization.

On April 30, 1983, the GMHC sponsored the first major fund-raising event for AIDS – a benefit performance of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

By 1984, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had requested GMHC&#x27;s assistance in planning public conferences on AIDS. That same year, the human immunodeficiency virus was discovered by the French doctors Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier. Within two years, GMHC was assisting heterosexual men and women (see Dennis Levy), hemophiliacs, intravenous drug users, and children.

From 1987 until his death from AIDS in 1989, Doctor Barry Gingell served as a medical director for the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis.

Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis received extensive coverage in Randy Shilts&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;.  The book described the progress of the pandemic, blaming the government, especially the Reagan administration and Secretary of Health Margaret Heckler, for failing to respond. It praised GMHC for its work. Shilts was a gay man who later died of AIDS.

===1990s===
GMHC, along with several other organizations, boycotted the 1990 International AIDS Conference in San Francisco, California in protest of the federal travel ban on people with HIV entering the United States. Though representatives from GMHC did not attend the official event, they did participate in a smaller conference, for people who had boycotted, which took place simultaneously in San Francisco.

The Fox Broadcasting Company donated the proceeds from the airing of the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium to GMHC.

GMHC debuted an HIV prevention subway campaign featuring gay and straight couples in 1994. GMHC admitted that the posters were &quot;more explicit&quot; than what they had produced in the past and featured animated condoms, lubricant and messages aimed towards sexually active youth, with the slogan &quot;Young! Hot! Safe!&quot; Staff at GMHC later said that the organization received bomb threats specifically citing the campaign.

GMHC employee James A. Fielding sued the organization alleging discrimination in 1994. Fielding sought $1.7 million in compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that he was not given a fair chance to apply for a role within GMHC, as leadership was afraid that, due to his HIV-positive status, he would have to call in sick.

A 1995 &quot;New York Times&quot; report detailing the FBI keeping a record of activist group ACT UP also claimed that the FBI kept a small file dedicated to GMHC.

Broadway star Bernadette Peters made her Carnegie Hall debut with a fundraiser for the organization.

GMHC began offering HIV testing and prevention counseling at its offices in 1997, at the David Geffen Center for HIV Prevention and Health Education after a $2.5 million gift from the David Geffen Foundation.

In 1997 the organization moved into headquarters at the nine-story Tisch Building at 119 West 24 Street in the Chelsea neighborhood. The building underwent a $12.5 million renovation. It is named for Preston Robert Tisch and Joan Tisch. The couple donated $3.5 million for the project and Joan is on the GMHC board of directors.

Weill-Cornell Medical Center opened the Chelsea Center for Special Studies, in GMHC&#x27;s building in 1997, in what was then described as the &quot;first large-scale collaboration between a major New York City hospital and an AIDS social service agency.&quot; The center offered medical services to people with HIV, many of them referred from GMHC.

Donna Summer headlined a fundraiser at Carnegie Hall that raised $400,000 for GMHC in 1998.

GMHC supported SB4422-B, a New York state bill to track new HIV infections in New York state, breaking from a consensus against such reporting among AIDS groups in the state. In its initial statement, GMHC supported following the &quot;same practice used for infectious diseases like syphilis and tuberculosis.&quot; In its statement, the organization did not initially say that it discouraged New York state from collecting names, though in a later clarification, it said that it supported a code-based system rather than using the names of people living with HIV.

In the 1990s a fundraising event on the Atlantic Ocean beach at Fire Island Pines, New York evolved into a major circuit party and developed a reputation for being connected with unsafe sex and recreational drug use. Activist Spencer Cox wrote a letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot; defending the party, which he called a &quot;drug-free event.&quot; He continued, &quot;Perhaps if he had attended the party, he might have a better sense of how this annual celebration contributes to the fight against AIDS ... As a person with AIDS, I am comforted to know that the money raised will be used to finance needed services, and hope that G.M.H.C. will not sacrifice those programs by discontinuing the Morning Party.&quot; GMHC pulled the plug after the 1998 fundraiser after one man died on Fire Island of an overdose of the drug gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) the evening before the party and 21 revelers were arrested for drug possession.

===2000s===
In the year 2000, Ana Oliveira, a lesbian and an acupuncturist, became the first woman to become the organization&#x27;s executive director. She had been an employee there since 1996 and founded the organization&#x27;s women&#x27;s program. The decision to appoint Oliveira to the position was unanimous.

In April 2000, GMHC released &quot;Men Like Us: The GMHC Complete Guide to Gay Men&#x27;s Sexual, Physical and Emotional Well-Being&quot;, written by the organization&#x27;s former communications director, Daniel Wolfe. The book included basic information about sex, sexual pleasure, as well as nutrition, exercise, communication with partners, and more. The book was one of 61 nonfiction books nominated for a Stonewall Book Award from the American Library Association. The award eventually went to &quot;Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet&quot;.  

The Museum of the City of New York debuted an exhibit, &quot;Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis: 20 Years Fighting for People with HIV/AIDS&quot;, a collaboration between the museum and GMHC in April 2001. Curators of the exhibit, Jane Rossett and Jean Carlomusto alleged that the institution eliminated explicit sexual content, including depictions of sexual intimacy between gay men, from the exhibit, altering the meaning of the exhibit and the materials presented within. The materials included items documenting public health information campaigns about AIDS. Lawrence D. Mass, one of GMHC&#x27;s founders, told the New York Times that the decision was &quot;disturbing&quot; and said the museum was practicing &quot;real censorship and distortion of history.&quot; In an opinion published in the New York Times, the museum&#x27;s director Robert Macdonald said the museum and GMHC &quot;decided that sexually explicit images would not be included in the exhibition&quot; in order to present the story to the &quot;widest possible audience.&quot; He added, &quot;To characterize that decision as censorship demonstrates a misguided view of the purpose of the exhibition and the professional responsibilities of museums.&quot;

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of AIDS in America, the AIDS Quilt hung in the GMHC lobby during World AIDS Day in 2001.

In the early 2000s, GMHC began a support group for people, especially gay men, who use crystal meth. In 2004, GMHC reported that 80% of new clients in its drug program reported using crystal meth, though it had been fewer than half in 2001. As part of an effort to raise awareness about a documented rise in crystal meth use, GMHC also began a poster campaign warning about the links between crystal meth and unsafe sex practices. The posters ran on gay cruising sites such as Manhunt. GMHC and other community groups also pushed back against efforts from federal prosecutors to distribute posters with the names and faces of known crystal meth dealers in gay neighborhoods, including Chelsea. In a January 2004 letter to the editor, Ana Oliveira expressed a desire to use a harm-reduction approach to crystal meth use.

Oliveira announced that she would leave GMHC, and her post as executive director, in December 2005. Dr. Marjoire Hill was named as the interim executive director in February 2006.

Due to decreased funding, GMHC ended its &quot;buddy program&quot; in 2005.

Prior to the 2008 presidential election, GMHC released a report outlining the stances of John McCain, Sarah Palin, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden on issues related to HIV/AIDS. After Barack Obama&#x27;s election, GMHC released a policy brief detailing a set of federal priorities related to HIV, including the development of a national HIV/AIDS strategy, the repeal of the HIV travel ban, as well as a repeal of the federal ban on syringe exchange.

GMHC has received multiple grants from the Carnegie Corporation, an organization that has supported more than 550 New York City arts and social service institutions since its inception in 2002, and which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg (along with 406 other arts and social service institutions).

=== 2010s ===
Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC) moved to a new and expanded home consisting of of redesigned and renovated space at 446 West 33rd Street in Manhattan. At the time of the announcement, co-founder Larry Kramer expressed disappointment with the move.

GMHC expanded its wide range of services for over 100,000 New Yorkers affected by HIV/AIDS. These services include health and nutrition education, legal, housing and mental health support, vocational training and case management. With a new state-of-the-art kitchen and larger dining room, free hot meals will be served to more clients. The Keith Haring Food Pantry Program will increase its capacity to provide grocery bags and nutrition counseling to more people in need.

During GMHC&#x27;s move into their new building they were met with discrimination from prospective landlords. Many did not understand what GMHC was and how they offered services to the community and those sick with HIV/AIDS. Even when GMHC found a place to live there were several restrictions placed upon by the landlord. A major one was that GMHC couldn&#x27;t perform any sort of medical procedures on the premises. This forced the GMHC clinic to not move along with the rest of GMHC.

The new location enabled GMHC to expand its services to meet the growing and complex needs of people affected by HIV/AIDS. In this 39th year of the epidemic, HIV continues to rise at alarming rates – locally and nationally – particularly among women, African Americans, Latinos and men who have sex with men.

In 2010, GMHC expanded its &quot;I Love My Boo&quot; anti-stigma campaign into New York City subways. The ads featured Black and Latino same-sex couples embracing, holding hands and kissing and promoted HIV testing among gay men of color. The campaign, which had previously run in gay bars, received positive praise from journalist Kai Wright, who called it one of the &quot;smartest, most compelling public health campaigns.&quot;

In May 2010, GMHC celebrated the 25th anniversary of its annual fundraiser, AIDS Walk New York. GMHC had hoped to raise $5.3 million for the occasion and ended up raising $5.7 million.

GMHC joined an open letter from several nonprofit organizations urging the FDA to approve Truvada for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis in 2011.

GMHC partnered with GLAAD to denounce the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene&#x27;s ad campaign &quot;Never Just HIV&quot;, which used graphic images to warn people that an HIV diagnosis could lead to other comorbidities. Francisco Roque, then the director of community health, said the ad campaign &quot;paints this picture of gay men as these sort of disease-ridden vessels.&quot; GLAAD President Jarrett Barrios called the ad &quot;sensationalized&quot; and added that it &quot;misses the mark in fairly and accurately representing what it&#x27;s like to live with HIV/AIDS.&quot;

The New York Public Library put together an exhibition, &quot;Celebrating 100 Years&quot;, in 2011 that was put together to &quot;show the depth and breadth&quot; of the library&#x27;s collection. The exhibition included condoms distributed by GMHC in the 1990s.

While appearing on the fifth season &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, comedian Lisa Lampanelli raised $130,000 for GMHC.

In September 2013, GMHC announced that the organization and its CEO, Dr. Marjorie Hill, had &quot;mutually decided&quot; that they would part ways and that she would leave her role. Subsequent reporting about Hill&#x27;s departure alleged that the organization&#x27;s board of directors fired Hill, apparently because Hill &quot;angered clients and staff.&quot; After news of her departure, a group of AIDS activists and professionals in the AIDS community wrote an open letter in support of Hill, noting that her service to GMHC is &quot;unprecedented&quot; and that she was at the time the longest-serving CEO with a tenure of seven years.

In the weeks following Hill&#x27;s resignation, GMHC faced scrutiny for what some activists deemed as a lack of leadership in facing the AIDS crisis in New York City. ACT UP member Peter Staley wrote in HuffPost, &quot; I can&#x27;t tell you how many gay men I know who feel that GMHC is no longer on the community&#x27;s radar&quot;, while a feature in the New York Times also spoke to several leaders who questioned the organization&#x27;s direction.

GMHC joined a coalition of national LGBTQ+-serving organizations and issued an open letter seeking justice for Trayvon Martin in July 2013.

During the 2013 New York City mayoral election, GMHC held a forum for candidates to speak about issues related to HIV/AIDS in the city. Both Bill DeBlasio and Anthony Weiner attended the forum, which took place only three days after the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal made breaking news. Participants included New York City comptroller John C. Liu, former comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., speaker for the New York City Council Christine Quinn, New York City Council member Sal F. Albanese and former Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrión Jr.

A 2013 DNAInfo report alleged that donations made to the annual AIDS Walk New York fundraiser were spent on administrative costs, including rent, rather than direct services. GMHC issued a statement calling the report &quot;grossly inaccurate&quot; and later released a statement which said that &quot;in a time of leadership transition we are vulnerable to the attacks of &quot;anonymous sources.&quot; GMHC said that due to stigma from landlords, it had few options for relocating in 2011, meaning a &quot;near doubling in rent.&quot;

GMHC joined a coalition of AIDS organizations in signing an open letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging that it stop using stigmatizing language, including &quot;unprotected anal sex&quot; in its materials. The letter stated that &quot;unprotected&quot; most often meant anal sex without a condom, but that the meaning of &quot;unprotected&quot; had changed alongside the approval of Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis.

The organization announced Kelsey Louie as the new CEO in April 2014.

After the approval of Truvada as pre-exposure prophylaxis in 2012, some AIDS service organizations spoke out against the drug, including Michael Weinstein of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, who called the pill a &quot;party drug.&quot; However, GMHC embraced Truvada and in October 2014 released a statement saying that GMHC would advocate for the &quot;widespread adoption&quot; of PrEP. In 2016, GMHC launched an ad campaign to spread awareness around PrEP. The ads ran at 10 bus shelters in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and uptown Manhattan.

GMHC helped to produce the return of the drag festival Wigstock in 2018.

The HIV prevention and testing programs expanded in the new GMHC Center for HIV Prevention at 224 West 29th Street in NYC which will include a new youth leadership-development program. In 2019, GMHC&#x27;s Testing Center moved to 307 West 38th Street where the offices are located as of 2018. In order to keep up with the COVID-19 global pandemic GMHC has begun offering HIV testing at home to make sure people are sticking to social distance guidelines. They have also closed their usual testing site and created an offsite location for continuing testing. The test results can take anywhere from 2–20 minutes for people to get an answer. While GMHC cannot give out HIV medications such as PrEP or PEP they can help people find options at a lower cost once they have a prescription.

In 2015 Larry Kramer was reunited with GMHC almost thirty years after he was removed from the organization. Even after years of criticism from Kramer about many of the choices made by GMHC, Kelsey Louie, a member of GMHC reached out to Kramer. After several meetings between Kelsey and Kramer a peace offering seemed to have been reached. Kramer was invited to GMHC&#x27;s gala as a special guest and presented with their first ever lifetime achievement award. Kramer held no ill will towards the organization and was happy to be invited back. Since his first appearance, Kramer continued to attend GMHC events and had even been invited to speak at GMHC staff meetings before his death in May 2020.

=== 2020s ===
To commemorate the 40th anniversary of AIDS in the United States, GMHC launched a video series featuring prominent members of the HIV/AIDS community, including GMHC co-founder Larry Mass, activist Mark S. King, and former speakers of the New York City council Corey Johnson. Those featured in the videos were invited to &quot;share their thoughts on what will it take to end the epidemic in our lifetimes.&quot;

GMHC helped stage a response to the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak in New York City. The organization created a dedication section of the website with information about the virus and handed out information about the virus at their annual Latex Ball fundraiser.

<doc id="437078" wikidata="Q147791" url="?curid=437078" title="Chamaecyparis">
<text>Chamaecyparis, common names cypress or false cypress (to distinguish it from related cypresses), is a genus of conifers in the cypress family Cupressaceae, native to eastern Asia (Japan and Taiwan) and to the western and eastern margins of the United States. The name is derived from the Greek &quot;khamai&quot; (χαμαί), meaning &quot;on the earth&quot;, and &quot;kuparissos&quot; (κυπάρισσος) for &quot;cypress&quot;.

They are medium-sized to large evergreen trees growing from tall, with foliage in flat sprays. The leaves are of two types, needle-like juvenile leaves on young seedlings up to a year old, and scale-like adult leaves. The cones are globose to oval, with 8-14 scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs; each scale bears 2-4 small seeds.

&quot;Chamaecyparis taiwanensis&quot; is treated by many authors as a variety of &quot;C. obtusa&quot; (as &quot;C. obtusa&quot; var. &quot;formosana&quot;).

Genus &quot;Fokienia&quot; is not always recognized as a separate genus from &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, in which case &quot;Chamaecyparis hodginsii&quot; (=&quot;Fokienia hodginsii&quot;) should be added to the above list. On the other hand, a species which used to be included in this genus, as &quot;Chamaecyparis nootkatensis&quot;, had been transferred on the basis of strong genetic and morphological evidence to the separate genus &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; as &quot;Xanthocyparis nootkatensis&quot; in the early 2000s. After further phylogenetic work the species was moved to the monotypic genus &quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot;, being sister to the genus &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot;, and both genera forming a clade with &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; as its sister.

There are also several species described from the fossil record including:
*†&quot;Chamaecyparis eureka&quot; – Middle Eocene, Axel Heiberg Island, Canada.
*†&quot;Chamaecyparis linguaefolia&quot; – Early-Middle Oligocene, Colorado, USA.
*†&quot;Chamaecyparis ravenscragensis&quot; – (=&quot;Fokienia ravenscragensis&quot;), if genus &quot;Fokienia&quot; is not recognized.

&quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; species are used as food plants by the larva of some Lepidoptera species, including juniper pug and pine beauty.

==Cultivation and uses==
Four species (&quot;C. lawsoniana, C. obtusa, C. pisifera&quot;, and &quot;C. thyoides&quot;) are of considerable importance as ornamental trees in horticulture; several hundred cultivars have been selected for various traits, including dwarf size, yellow, blue, silvery or variegated foliage, permanent retention of juvenile leaves, and thread-like shoots with reduced branching. In some areas, cultivation is limited by &quot;Phytophthora&quot; root rot diseases, with &quot;C. lawsoniana&quot; being particularly susceptible to &quot;P. lateralis&quot;.

The wood is scented, and is highly valued, particularly in Japan, where it is used for temple construction.

<doc id="437080" wikidata="Q1504958" url="?curid=437080" title="Dogging (sexual slang)">
<text>Dogging is a British English slang term for engaging in sexual acts in a public or semi-public place or watching others doing so. There may be more than two participants; both group sex and gang banging can be included. As observation is encouraged, voyeurism and exhibitionism are closely associated with dogging. The people involved meet either randomly or, increasingly, arrange beforehand over the Internet to meet up.

In September 2003, BBC News reported on the &quot;new&quot; dogging craze. They cited the Internet and text messaging as common ways of organising meetings. The original definition of dogging—and which remains a closely related activity—is spying on couples having sex in a car or other public place, and the term had been in use on Britain&#x27;s railways for many years. It would have been well-known at least as far back as 1951.

There is some evidence on the Internet that the &quot;craze&quot; has begun to spread to other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.

==Legality==
In Great Britain, dogging comes under laws related to voyeurism, exhibitionism, or public displays of sexual behaviour. Prosecution is possible for a number of offences such as Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, exposure under section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, or for the common law offence of outraging public decency. Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) policy was that arrests are a last resort and a more gradual approach should be taken in such circumstances. As such public sex in some areas of the UK sits in a slightly grey area legally: &quot;…Public sex is a popular—and quasi-legal—activity in Britain, according to the authorities and to the large number of Web sites that promote it. (It is treated as a crime only if someone witnesses it, is offended and is willing to make a formal complaint.) And the police tend to tread lightly in public sex environments, in part because of the bitter legacy of the time when gay sex was illegal and closeted men having anonymous sex in places like public bathrooms were routinely arrested and humiliated.&quot;

==Terminology==
The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; of Scotland wrote in 2003, &quot;The term dogging originated in the early 1970s to describe men who spied on couples having sex outdoors—these men would &#x27;&#x27; the couples&#x27; every move and watch them.&quot; An alternative etymology posits dog walking as the origin of the term; audience members, and indeed participants, could use the ordinary exercise of their pets as cover for their sexual assignations.

<text>The International Journal of Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy was a peer-reviewed scientific journal of psychiatry and psychotherapy published by the International Journal Press and Jason Aronson from 1974 until 1985.

It was formed by the merger of the International Journal of Psychiatry published by the International Science Press from 1965 until 1973, and the International Journal of Child Psychotherapy (, , ) published by the International Journal Press from 1972 until 1973.
At some point or another during their respective existences, all three titles were included in the Science Citation Index and PubMed/MEDLINE.

<doc id="437090" wikidata="Q1086863" url="?curid=437090" title="Columnist">
<text>A columnist is a person who writes for publication in a series, creating an article that usually offers commentary and opinions. Columns appear in newspapers, magazines and other publications, including blogs. They take the form of a short essay by a specific writer who offers a personal point of view. Columns are sometimes written by a composite or a team, appearing under a pseudonym, or (in effect) a brand name. Columnists typically write daily or weekly columns. Some columns are later collected and reprinted in book form.

==Radio and television==
Newspaper columnists of the 1930s and 1940s, such as Franklin Pierce Adams (also known as FPA), Nick Kenny, John Crosby, Jimmie Fidler, Louella Parsons, Drew Pearson, Ed Sullivan and Walter Winchell, achieved a celebrity status and used their syndicated columns as a springboard to move into radio and television. In some cases, such as Winchell and Parsons, their radio programs were quite similar in format to their newspaper columns. Rona Barrett began as a Hollywood gossip columnist in 1957, duplicating her print tactics on television by the mid-1960s. One of the more famous syndicated columnists of the 1920s and 1930s, O. O. McIntyre, declined offers to do a radio series because he felt it would interfere and diminish the quality of writing in his column, &quot;New York Day by Day&quot;.

==Books==
Franklin Pierce Adams and O. O. McIntyre both collected their columns into a series of books, as did other columnists. McIntyre&#x27;s book, &quot;The Big Town: New York Day by Day&quot; (1935) was a bestseller. Adams&#x27; &quot;The Melancholy Lute&quot; (1936) is a collection of selections from three decades of his columns. H. Allen Smith&#x27;s first humor book, &quot;Low Man on a Totem Pole&quot; (1941), and his two following books, were so popular during World War II that they kept Smith on the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Best Seller List for 100 weeks and prompted a collection of all three in &quot;3 Smiths in the Wind&quot; (1946). When Smith&#x27;s column, &quot;The Totem Pole&quot;, was syndicated by United Features, he told &quot;Time&quot;:

Just between you and me, it&#x27;s tough. A typewriter can be a pretty formidable contraption when you sit down in front of it and say: &quot;All right, now I&#x27;m going to be funny.&quot;

The writing of French humor columnist Alain Rémond has been collected in books. &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; promoted humor columnist Dave Barry with this description: &quot;Dave Barry has been at &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; since 1983. A Pulitzer Prize winner for commentary, he writes about issues ranging from the international economy to exploding toilets.&quot; Barry has collected his columns into a series of successful books. He stopped writing his nationally syndicated weekly column in 2005, and the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; now offers on its website a lengthy selection of past columns by Barry.

In 1950, &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; looked back at the newspaper columnists of the 1920s:

&quot;Feature service of various sorts is new&quot;, Hallam Walker Davis wrote in a book, &quot;The Column&quot;, which was published in 1926. &quot;It has had the advantage of high-powered promotion. It is still riding on the crest of the first big wave its own splash sent out.&quot; But Mr. Davis did think that in a decade or two the newspapers might be promoting their columns along with their comic strips. &quot;The World&quot; had started the ball rolling with billboard advertising of Heywood Broun&#x27;s &quot;It Seems to Me&quot;. The McNaught Syndicate was sitting pretty with O. O. McIntyre, Will Rogers and Irvin S. Cobb on its list. &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; offered Don Marquis and Franklin P. Adams rhymed satirically in &quot;The Conning Tower&quot; for the New York World Syndicate. &quot;A Line o&#x27; Type or Two&quot;, Bert Leston Taylor&#x27;s verse column in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, was now being done by Richard Henry Little. Other offerings: humorous sketches by Damon Runyon; O. Henry stories; editorials by Arthur Brisbane; Ring Lardner letter; &quot;Rippling Rhymes&quot;, by Walt Mason; literary articles by H. L. Mencken.

==Newspaper and magazine==
In certain instances, a column can prove so popular it becomes the basis for an expansion into an entire magazine. For instance, when Cyrus Curtis founded the &quot;Tribune and Farmer&quot; in 1879, it was a four-page weekly with an annual subscription rate of 50 cents. He introduced a women&#x27;s column by his wife, Louise Knapp Curtis, and it proved so popular that in 1883 he started publishing it as a separate monthly supplement, &quot;Ladies Journal and Practical Housekeeper&quot;, edited by Louise Curtis. With 25,000 subscribers by the end of its first year, it was such a success that Curtis sold &quot;Tribune and Farmer&quot; to put his energy into the new publication, which became the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;.

There is sometimes crossover between being a politician and a columnist. For example, Boris Johnson had a column in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, was elected a member of the UK Parliament, became Mayor of London then UK Prime Minister, then became a columnist for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on being forced out of office.

Carl Rowan was a famous black columnist who wrote for The Mineapollis Tribune. His articles about racism and international affairs made him famous across the USA. In 1961, he was asked by the president John F. Kennedy to join his administration. He then became a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs. That was all made possible due to his interview with Mr. Kennedy that happened year before. 

In pop culture the profession of &#x27;columnist&#x27; has been seen as glamorous, and is often used as the career of choice for fictional characters such as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, Rory Gilmore in Gilmore Girls, Andie Anderson in How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and dozens of others.

<text>The black-throated green warbler (Setophaga virens) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

==Description==
It has an olive-green crown, a yellow face with olive markings, a thin pointed bill, white wing bars, an olive-green back and pale underparts with black streaks on the flanks. Adult males have a black throat and upper breast; females have a pale throat and black markings on their breast.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Habitat and distribution==
The breeding habitat of the black-throated green warbler is coniferous and mixed forests in eastern North America and western Canada and cypress swamps on the southern Atlantic coast, with preference for dense stands of conifers. These birds&#x27; nests are open cups, which are usually situated close to the trunk of a tree.

These birds migrate to Mexico, Central America, the West Indies and southern Florida. One destination is to the Petenes mangroves of the Yucatán. Some birds straggle as far as South America, with the southernmost couple of records coming from Ecuador.

== Hybridization ==
The black-throated green warbler has been reported to hybridize with the congeneric Townsend&#x27;s warbler where their range overlaps in the Rocky Mountains.

==Behavior==

Black-throated green warblers forage actively in vegetation, and they sometimes hover (gleaning), or catch insects in flight (hawking). Insects are the main constituents of these birds&#x27; diets, although berries will occasionally be consumed.

The song of this bird is a buzzed &#x27; or &#x27;. The call is a sharp &quot;&quot;.

This bird is vulnerable to nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird.

<doc id="437099" wikidata="Q58074" url="?curid=437099" title="Erik Erikson">
<text>Erik Homburger Erikson (born Erik Salomonsen; 15 June 1902 – 12 May 1994) was a Danish-German-Jewish child psychoanalyst and visual artist known for his theory on psychosocial development of human beings. He coined the phrase identity crisis.

Despite lacking a university degree, Erikson served as a professor at prominent institutions, including Harvard, University of California, Berkeley, and Yale. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Erikson as the 12th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Erikson&#x27;s mother, Karla Abrahamsen, came from a prominent Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was married to Jewish stockbroker Valdemar Isidor Salomonsen but had been estranged from him for several months at the time Erik was conceived. Little is known about Erik&#x27;s biological father except that he was a non-Jewish Dane. On discovering her pregnancy, Karla fled to Frankfurt am Main in Germany where Erik was born on 15 June 1902 and was given the surname &quot;Salomonsen&quot;. She fled due to conceiving Erik out of wedlock, and the identity of Erik&#x27;s birth father was never made clear.

Following Erik&#x27;s birth, Karla trained to be a nurse and moved to Karlsruhe, Germany. In 1905 she married a Jewish pediatrician, Theodor Homburger. In 1908, Erik Salomonsen&#x27;s name was changed to Erik Homburger, and in 1911 he was officially adopted by his stepfather. Karla and Theodor told Erik that Theodor was his real father, only revealing the truth to him in late childhood; he remained bitter about the deception all his life.

The development of identity seems to have been one of Erikson&#x27;s greatest concerns in his own life as well as being central to his theoretical work. As an older adult, he wrote about his adolescent &quot;identity confusion&quot; in his European days. &quot;My identity confusion&quot;, he wrote, &quot;[was at times on] the borderline between neurosis and adolescent psychosis.&quot; Erikson&#x27;s daughter wrote that her father&#x27;s &quot;real psychoanalytic identity&quot; was not established until he &quot;replaced his stepfather&#x27;s surname [Homburger] with a name of his invention [Erikson].&quot; The decision to change his last name came about as he started his job at Yale, and the &quot;Erikson&quot; name was accepted by Erik&#x27;s family when they became American citizens. It is said his children enjoyed the fact they would not be called &quot;Hamburger&quot; any longer.

Erik was a tall, blond, blue-eyed boy who was raised in the Jewish religion. Due to these mixed identities, he was a target of bigotry by both Jewish and gentile children. At temple school, his peers teased him for being Nordic; while at grammar school, he was teased for being Jewish. At Das Humanistische Gymnasium his main interests were art, history, and languages, but he lacked a general interest in school and graduated without academic distinction. After graduation, instead of attending medical school as his stepfather had desired, he attended art school in Munich, much to the liking of his mother and her friends.

Uncertain about his vocation and his fit in society, Erik dropped out of school and began a lengthy period of roaming about Germany and Italy as a wandering artist with his childhood friend Peter Blos and others. For children from prominent German families, taking a &quot;wandering year&quot; was not uncommon. During his travels, he often sold or traded his sketches to people he met. Eventually, Erik realized he would never become a full-time artist and returned to Karlsruhe and became an art teacher. During the time he worked at his teaching job, Erik was hired by an heiress to sketch and eventually tutor her children. Erik worked very well with these children and was eventually hired by many other families that were close to Anna and Sigmund Freud. This teaching extended into a small experimental school based in the house of Eva Rosenfeld. During this period, which lasted until he was twenty-five years old, he continued to contend with questions about his father and competing ideas of ethnic, religious, and national identity.

==Psychoanalytic experience and training==
When Erikson was twenty-five, his friend Peter Blos invited him to Vienna to tutor art at the small Burlingham-Rosenfeld School for children whose affluent parents were undergoing psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud&#x27;s daughter, Anna Freud. Anna noticed Erikson&#x27;s sensitivity to children at the school and encouraged him to study psychoanalysis at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute, where prominent analysts August Aichhorn, Heinz Hartmann, and Paul Federn were among those who supervised his theoretical studies. He specialized in child analysis and underwent a training analysis with Anna Freud. Helene Deutsch and Edward Bibring supervised his initial treatment of an adult. Simultaneously he studied the Montessori method of education, which focused on child development and sexual stages. In 1933 he received his diploma from the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. This and his Montessori diploma were to be Erikson&#x27;s only earned credentials for his life&#x27;s work.

==United States==
In 1930 Erikson married Joan Mowat Serson, a Canadian dancer and artist whom Erikson had met at a dress ball. During their marriage, Erikson converted to Christianity. In 1933, with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, the burning of Freud&#x27;s books in Berlin, and the potential Nazi threat to Austria, the family left an impoverished Vienna with their two young sons and emigrated to Copenhagen. Unable to regain Danish citizenship because of residence requirements, the family left for the United States, where citizenship would not be an issue.

In the United States, Erikson became the first child psychoanalyst in Boston and held positions at Massachusetts General Hospital, the Judge Baker Guidance Center, and at Harvard Medical School and Psychological Clinic. This was while he was establishing a singular reputation as a clinician. In 1936, Erikson left Harvard and joined the staff at Yale University, where he worked at the Institute of Social Relations and taught at the medical school.

Erikson continued to deepen his interest in areas beyond psychoanalysis and to explore connections between psychology and anthropology. He made important contacts with anthropologists such as Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, and Ruth Benedict. Erikson said his theory of the development of thought derived from his social and cultural studies. In 1938, he left Yale to study the Sioux tribe in South Dakota on their reservation. After his studies in South Dakota, he traveled to California to study the Yurok tribe. Erikson discovered differences between the children of the Sioux and Yurok tribes. This marked the beginning of Erikson&#x27;s life passion of showing the importance of events in childhood and how society affects them.

In 1939 he left Yale, and the Eriksons moved to California, where Erik had been invited to join a team engaged in a longitudinal study of child development for the University of California at Berkeley&#x27;s Institute of Child Welfare. In addition, in San Francisco, he opened a private practice in child psychoanalysis.

While in California he was able to make his second study of American Indian children when he joined anthropologist Alfred Kroeber on a field trip to Northern California to study the Yurok.

In 1950, after publishing the book, &quot;Childhood and Society&quot;, for which he is best known, Erikson left the University of California when California&#x27;s Levering Act required professors there to sign loyalty oaths. From 1951 to 1960 he worked and taught at the Austen Riggs Center, a prominent psychiatric treatment facility in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where he worked with emotionally troubled young people. Another famous Stockbridge resident, Norman Rockwell, became Erikson&#x27;s patient and friend. During this time he also served as a visiting professor at the University of Pittsburgh where he worked with Benjamin Spock and Fred Rogers at Arsenal Nursery School of the Western Psychiatric Institute.

He returned to Harvard in the 1960s as a professor of human development and remained there until his retirement in 1970. In 1973 the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Erikson for the Jefferson Lecture, the United States&#x27; highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Erikson&#x27;s lecture was titled &quot;Dimensions of a New Identity&quot;.

==Theories of development and the ego==

Erikson is credited with being one of the originators of ego psychology, which emphasized the role of the ego as being more than a servant of the id. Although Erikson accepted Freud&#x27;s theory, he did not focus on the parent-child relationship and gave more importance to the role of the ego, particularly the person&#x27;s progression as self. According to Erikson, the environment in which a child lived was crucial to providing growth, adjustment, a source of self-awareness and identity. Erikson won a Pulitzer Prize and a US National Book Award in category Philosophy and Religion for &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s Truth&quot; (1969), which focused more on his theory as applied to later phases in the life cycle.

In Erikson&#x27;s discussion of development, he rarely mentioned a stage of development by age. In fact he referred to it as a &quot;prolonged adolescence&quot; which has led to further investigation into a period of development between adolescence and young adulthood called &quot;emerging adulthood&quot;. Erikson&#x27;s theory of development includes various psychosocial crises where each conflict builds off of the previous stages. The result of each conflict can have negative or positive impacts on a person&#x27;s development, however, a negative outcome can be revisited and readdressed throughout the life span. On ego identity versus role confusion: ego identity enables each person to have a sense of individuality, or as Erikson would say, &quot;Ego identity, then, in its subjective aspect, is the awareness of the fact that there is a self-sameness and continuity to the ego&#x27;s synthesizing methods and a continuity of one&#x27;s meaning for others&quot;. Role confusion, however, is, according to Barbara Engler, &quot;the inability to conceive of oneself as a productive member of one&#x27;s own society.&quot; This inability to conceive of oneself as a productive member is a great danger; it can occur during adolescence, when looking for an occupation.

==Theory of personality==
The Erikson life-stages, in order of the eight stages in which they may be acquired, are listed below, as well as the &quot;virtues&quot; that Erikson has attached to these stages, (these virtues are underlined). The term &quot;virtue&quot; refers to favorable outcomes of each stage and is used in the context of Erikson&#x27;s work as it is applied to medicine, meaning &quot;potencies&quot;. These virtues are also interpreted to be the same as &quot;strengths&quot;, which are considered inherent in the individual life cycle and in the sequence of generations. Erikson&#x27;s research suggests that each individual must learn how to hold both extremes of each specific life-stage challenge in tension with one another, not rejecting one end of the tension or the other. Only when both extremes in a life-stage challenge are understood and accepted as both required and useful, can the optimal virtue for that stage surface. Thus, &#x27;trust&#x27; and &#x27;mis-trust&#x27; must both be understood and accepted, in order for realistic &#x27;hope&#x27; to emerge as a viable solution at the first stage. Similarly, &#x27;integrity&#x27; and &#x27;despair&#x27; must both be understood and embraced, in order for actionable &#x27;wisdom&#x27; to emerge as a viable solution at the last stage.

===1. Hope: basic trust vs. basic mistrust===
This stage covers the period of infancy, 0–1½ years old, which is the most fundamental stage of life, as this is the stage that all other ones build on. Whether the baby develops basic trust or basic mistrust is not merely a matter of nurture. It is multi-faceted and has strong social components. It depends on the quality of the maternal relationship. The mother carries out and reflects her inner perceptions of trustworthiness, a sense of personal meaning, etc. on the child. An important part of this stage is providing stable and constant care of the infant. This helps the child develop trust that can transition into relationships other than parental. Additionally, children develop trust in others to support them. If successful in this, the baby develops a sense of trust, which &quot;forms the basis in the child for a sense of identity.&quot; Failure to develop this trust will result in a feeling of fear and a sense that the world is inconsistent and unpredictable.

===2. Will: autonomy vs. shame===
This stage covers early childhood around 1½–3 years old and introduces the concept of autonomy vs. shame and doubt. The child begins to discover the beginnings of their independence, and parents must facilitate the child&#x27;s sense of doing basic tasks &quot;all by themselves.&quot; Discouragement can lead to the child doubting their efficacy. During this stage the child is usually trying to master toilet training. Additionally, the child discovers their talents or abilities, and it is important to ensure the child is able to explore those activities. Erikson states it is essential to allow the children freedom in exploration but also create an environment welcoming of failures. Therefore, the parent should not punish or reprimand the child for failing at the task. Shame and doubt occurs when the child feels incompetent in ability to complete tasks and survive. Will is achieved with success of this stage. Children successful in this stage will have &quot;self-control without a loss of self-esteem.&quot;

===3. Purpose: initiative vs. guilt===
This stage covers preschool children from ages three to five. Does the child have the ability to do things on their own, such as dress themselves? Children in this stage are interacting with peers, and creating their own games and activities. Children in this stage practice independence and start to make their own decisions. If allowed to make these decisions, the child will develop confidence in their ability to lead others. If the child is not allowed to make certain decisions, then a sense of guilt develops. Guilt in this stage is characterized by a sense of being a burden to others, and the child will therefore usually present themselves as a follower as they lack the confidence to do otherwise. Additionally, the child is asking many questions to build knowledge of the world. If the questions earn responses that are critical and condescending, the child will also develop feelings of guilt. Success in this stage leads to the virtue of purpose, which is the normal balance between the two extremes.

===4. Competence: industry vs. inferiority===
This area coincides with the &quot;latency&quot; period of psychoanalysis and covers school age children before adolescence. Children compare their self worth to others around them. Friends can have a significant impact on the growth of the child. The child can recognize major disparities in personal abilities relative to other children. Erikson places some emphasis on the teacher, who should ensure that children do not feel inferior. During this stage the child&#x27;s friend group increases in importance in their life. Often during this stage the child will try to prove competency with things rewarded in society, and also develop satisfaction with their abilities. Encouraging the child increases feelings of adequacy and competency in ability to reach goals. Restriction from teachers or parents leads to doubt, questioning, and reluctance in abilities and therefore may not reach full capabilities. Competence, the virtue of this stage, is developed when a healthy balance between the two extremes is reached.

===5. Fidelity: identity vs. role confusion===
This section deals with adolescence, meaning those between twelve and eighteen years old. This occurs when we start to question ourselves and ask questions relevant to who we are and what we want to accomplish. Who am I, how do I fit in? Where am I going in life? The adolescent is exploring and seeking for their own unique identity. This is done by looking at personal beliefs, goals, and values. The morality of the individual is also explored and developed. Erikson believes that if the parents allow the child to explore, they will determine their own identity. If, however, the parents continually push them to conform to their views, the teen will face identity confusion. The teen is also looking towards the future in terms of employment, relationships, and families. Learning the roles they provide in society is essential since the teen begins to develop the desire to fit into society. Fidelity is characterized by the ability to commit to others and acceptance of others even with differences. Identity crisis is the result of role confusion and can cause the adolescent to try out different lifestyles.

===6. Love: intimacy vs. isolation===
This is the first stage of adult development. This development usually happens during young adulthood, which is between the ages of 18 and 40. This stage marks a transition from just thinking about ourselves to thinking about other people in the world. We are social creatures and as a result need to be with other people and form relationships with them. Dating, marriage, family and friendships are important during this stage in their life. This is due to the increase in the growth of intimate relationships with others.

Ego development earlier in life (middle adolescence) is a strong predictor of how well intimacy for romantic relationships will transpire in emerging adulthood. By successfully forming loving relationships with other people, individuals are able to experience love and intimacy. They also feel safety, care, and commitment in these relationships. Furthermore, if individuals are able to successfully resolve the crisis of intimacy versus isolation, they are able to achieve the virtue of love. Those who fail to form lasting relationships may feel isolated and alone.

===7. Care: generativity vs. stagnation===
The second stage of adulthood happens between the ages of 40 and 65. During this time people are normally settled in their lives and know what is important to them. A person is either making progress in their career or treading lightly in their career and unsure if this is what they want to do for the rest of their working life. Also during this time, a person may be raising their children. If they are a parent, then they are reevaluating their life roles. This is one way of contributing to society along with productivity at work and involvement in community activities and organizations. Individuals who exercise the concept of generativity believe in the next generation and seek to nurture them in creative ways through practices such as parenting, teaching, and mentoring. Having a sense of generativity can be considered significant for both the individual and the society, exemplifying their roles as effective parents, leaders for organizations, etc. If a person is not comfortable with the way their life is progressing, they&#x27;re usually regretful about the decisions that they have made in the past and feels a sense of uselessness.

===8. Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===
This stage affects the age group of 65 and on. During this time an individual has reached the last chapter in their life and retirement is approaching or has already taken place. Individuals in this stage must learn to accept the course of their life or they will look back on it with despair. Ego-integrity means the acceptance of life in its fullness: the victories and the defeats, what was accomplished and what was not accomplished. Wisdom is the result of successfully accomplishing this final developmental task. Wisdom is defined as &quot;informed and detached concern for life itself in the face of death itself.&quot; Having a guilty conscience about the past or failing to accomplish important goals will eventually lead to depression and hopelessness. Achieving the virtue of the stage involves the feeling of living a successful life.

===Ninth stage===
For the Ninth Stage see Erikson&#x27;s stages of psychosocial development § Ninth Stage.

== Psychology of religion ==
Psychoanalytic writers have always engaged in nonclinical interpretation of cultural phenomena such as art, religion, and historical movements. Erik Erikson gave such a strong contribution that his work was well received by students of religion and spurred various secondary literature.

Erikson&#x27;s psychology of religion begins with an acknowledgement of how religious tradition can have an interplay with a child&#x27;s basic sense of trust or mistrust. With regard to Erikson&#x27;s theory of personality as expressed in his eight stages of the life cycle, each with their different tasks to master, each also included a corresponding virtue, as mentioned above, which form a taxonomy for religious and ethical life. Erikson extends this construct by emphasizing that human individual and social life is characterized by ritualization, &quot;an agreed-upon interplay between at least two persons who repeat it at meaningful intervals and in recurring contexts.&quot; Such ritualization involves careful attentiveness to what can be called ceremonial forms and details, higher symbolic meanings, active engagement of participants, and a feeling of absolute necessity. Each life cycle stage includes its own ritualization with a corresponding ritualism: numinous vs. idolism, judicious vs. legalism, dramatic vs. impersonation, formal vs. formalism, ideological vs. totalism, affiliative vs. elitism, generational vs. authoritism, and integral vs. dogmatism.

Perhaps Erikson&#x27;s best-known contributions to the psychology of religion were his book length psychobiographies, &quot;Young Man Luther: A Study in Psychoanalysis and History&quot;, on Martin Luther, and &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s Truth&quot;, on Mahatma Gandhi, for which he remarkably won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Both books attempt to show how childhood development and parental influence, social and cultural context, and even political crises form a confluence with personal identity. These studies demonstrate how each influential person discovered mastery, both individually and socially, in what Erikson would call the historical moment. Individuals like Luther or Gandhi were what Erikson called a Homo Religiosus, individuals for whom the final life cycle challenge of integrity vs. despair is a lifelong crisis, and they become gifted innovators whose own psychological cure becomes an ideological breakthrough for their time.

==Personal life==
Erikson married Canadian-born American dancer and artist Joan Erikson (née Sarah Lucretia Serson) in 1930 and they remained together until his death.

The Eriksons had four children: Kai T. Erikson, Jon Erikson, Sue Erikson Bloland, and Neil Erikson. His eldest son, Kai T. Erikson, is an American sociologist. Their daughter, Sue, &quot;an integrative psychotherapist and psychoanalyst&quot;, described her father as plagued by &quot;lifelong feelings of personal inadequacy&quot;. He thought that by combining resources with his wife, he could &quot;achieve the recognition&quot; that might produce a feeling of adequacy.

Erikson died on 12 May 1994 in Harwich, Massachusetts. He is buried in the First Congregational Church Cemetery in Harwich.

<text>Crystal Boys (孽子, pinyin: &quot;Nièzǐ&quot;, &quot;sons of sin&quot;) is a novel written by author Pai Hsien-yung and first published in 1983 in Taiwan. In 1988, this novel went into circulation in China; its French and English translations were published in 1985 and 1989, respectively. A translation into German (&quot;Treffpunkt Lotussee&quot;) appeared in 1995.

&quot;Nièzǐ&quot; means literally &quot;sinful sons&quot; or &quot;sons of sin&quot;, but it may also be an allusion to a passage in Mencius in which &quot;friendless officials and concubine&#x27;s sons&quot; (孤臣孽子) reach positions of power because they have learned to live with a dangerous status.

A movie called &quot;Outcasts&quot;, based on this novel, was released in 1986. In 2003, the material was adapted by Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation into a miniseries.

There is a reference to You Xian Ku in the chapter &quot;Journey to the Goblin Cave&quot;.

== Plot summary==
The story takes place in Taipei in 1971 (or, in the most recent film adaptation, in 1973), and follows a short period in the life of a young man called Li-Qing (李青, nicknamed &quot;A-Qing&quot;).

When A-Qing is expelled from his school because of &quot;scandalous relations&quot; with classmate Zhao Ying (趙英), his father kicks him out of the family home. A-Qing begins to hang out at a park called New Park, a gay cruising area and hangout for gay men, where he meets the novel&#x27;s other primary characters.

== Characters ==
* A-Qing 阿青: the main character, a strong character both emotionally and physically. 
* Di-wa 弟娃: A-Qing&#x27;s younger brother.
* Xiao Yu 小玉: A somewhat flamboyant Japanese-Taiwanese. Dreams of going to Japan to find his father.
* Lao Shu (Mouse) 老鼠: A petty thief, a bit sloppy, a little silly. Lives with his abusive older brother in a house of gambling and crime.
* Wu Min 吴敏: Like A-Qing, was kicked from his home by his father. While physically strong, he is emotionally weak, attempting suicide after his lover breaks up with him.
* Master Yang, Shi Fu 師傅: Pimp of the above-mentioned characters, he helps give them jobs and protection, later opening a gay bar.
* Lao Guo 老郭: A retired photographer, who keeps a photo book of the various characters who flock to the park. First one to take A-Qing in.
* Long Zi (Dragon) 王夔龙， 龍子: Returns to Taipei after living in USA, where he went after murdering his lover A-Feng in a fit of rage. Their story has become legendary in the park.
* A-Feng (Phoenix) 阿鳳: The wild son of a mute woman, grew up an orphan. Was Long Zi&#x27;s lover, but was killed by him.

The story focuses on A-Qing&#x27;s struggle between himself, his family, and a society where homosexuality is taboo.

== Translations == 
An English translation of the novel by Howard Goldblatt, titled &quot;Crystal Boys&quot;, was published in 1990 by Gay Sunshine Press.

== TV series ==
The TV series &quot;Crystal Boys &quot; stars:

<doc id="437103" wikidata="Q848390" url="?curid=437103" title="Root canal">
<text>A root canal is the naturally occurring anatomic space within the root of a tooth. It consists of the pulp chamber (within the coronal part of the tooth), the main canal(s), and more intricate anatomical branches that may connect the root canals to each other or to the surface of the root.

==Structure==
At the center of every tooth is a hollow area that houses soft tissues, such as the nerve, blood vessels, and connective tissue. This hollow area contains a relatively wide space in the coronal portion of the tooth called the pulp chamber. These canals run through the center of the roots, similar to the way graphite runs through a pencil. The pulp receives nutrition through the blood vessels, and sensory nerves carry signals back to the brain. A tooth can be relieved from pain if there is irreversible damage to the pulp, via root canal treatment.

Root canal anatomy consists of the pulp chamber and root canals. Both contain the dental pulp. The smaller branches, referred to as &quot;accessory canals&quot;, are most frequently found near the root end (apex), but may be encountered anywhere along the root length. The total number of root canals per tooth depends on the number of the tooth roots ranging from one to four, five or more in some cases. Sometimes there are more than one root canal per root. Some teeth have a more variable internal anatomy than others. 

An unusual root canal shape, complex branching (especially the existence of horizontal branches), and multiple root canals are considered as the main causes of root canal treatment failures. (e.g. If a secondary root canal goes unnoticed by the dentist and is not cleaned and sealed, it will remain infected, causing the root canal therapy to fail).

=== Root canal system ===

The specific features and complexity of the internal anatomy of the teeth have been thoroughly studied. Using a replica technique on thousands of teeth, Walter Hess made clear as early as 1917 that the internal space of dental roots is often a complex system composed of a central area (root canals with round, oval or irregular cross-sectional shape) and lateral parts (fins, anastomoses and accessory canals). In fact, this lateral component may represent a relatively large volume, which challenges the cleaning phase of the instrumentation procedure in that tissue remnants of the vital or necrotic pulp as well as infectious elements are not easily removed in these areas. Thus, the image of root canals having a smooth, conical shape is generally too idealistic and underestimates the reach of root canal instrumentation.

===Contents===

The space inside the root canals is filled with a highly vascularized, loose connective tissue, called &quot;dental pulp&quot;. The dental pulp is the tissue of which the dentin portion of the tooth is composed. The dental pulp helps complete formation of the secondary teeth (adult teeth) one to two years after eruption into the mouth. The dental pulp also nourishes and hydrates the tooth structure, making the tooth more resilient, less brittle and less prone to fracture from chewing hard foods. Additionally, the dental pulp provides a hot and cold sensory function.

===Variation===

Root canals presenting an oval cross-section are found in 50–70% of root canals. In addition, canals with a &quot;tear-shaped&quot; cross section are common when a single root contains two canals (as occurs, for example, with the additional mesial root seen with the lower molars), subtleties that can be more difficult to appreciate on classical radiographs. 

Recent studies have shown that use of cone-down CT scans can detect accessory canals that would have been missed in 23% of cases, which can in turn lead to apical periodontitis. The upper molars, in particular, are predisposed to have an occult accessory canal in nearly half of patients.

==Clinical significance==

Root canal is also a colloquial term for a dental operation, endodontic therapy, wherein the pulp is cleaned out, the space disinfected and then filled.

When rotary nickel titanium (NiTi) files are used in canals with flat-oval or tear-shaped cross sections, a circular bore is created due to the rotational action of the metal. Also, small cavities within the canal such as the buccal or lingual recesses may not be instrumented within the tooth, potentially leaving residual disease during disinfection.

Tissue or biofilm remnants along such un-instrumented recesses may lead to failure due to both inadequate disinfection and the inability to properly obturate the root-canal space. Consequently, the biofilm should be removed with a disinfectant, commonly sodium hypochlorite, during root canal treatment.

<doc id="437107" wikidata="Q652419" url="?curid=437107" title="Mipmap">
<text>In computer graphics, mipmaps (also MIP maps) or pyramids are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the previous. The height and width of each image, or level, in the mipmap is a factor of two smaller than the previous level. Mipmaps do not have to be square. They are intended to increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing artifacts. A high-resolution mipmap image is used for high-density samples, such as for objects close to the camera; lower-resolution images are used as the object appears farther away. This is a more efficient way of downscaling a texture than sampling all texels in the original texture that would contribute to a screen pixel; it is faster to take a constant number of samples from the appropriately downfiltered textures. Mipmaps are widely used in 3D computer games, flight simulators, other 3D imaging systems for texture filtering, and 2D and 3D GIS software. Their use is known as mipmapping. The letters &quot;MIP&quot; in the name are an acronym of the Latin phrase &quot;multum in parvo&quot;, meaning &quot;much in little&quot;.

Since mipmaps, by definition, are pre-allocated, additional storage space is required to take advantage of them. They are also related to wavelet compression. Mipmap textures are used in 3D scenes to decrease the time required to render a scene. They also improve image quality by reducing aliasing and Moiré patterns that occur at large viewing distances, at the cost of 33% more memory per texture.

==Overview==

Mipmaps are used for:
* Level of detail (LOD)
* Improving image quality. Rendering from large textures where only small, discontiguous subsets of texels are used can easily produce Moiré patterns;
* Speeding up rendering times, either by reducing the number of texels sampled to render each pixel, or increasing the memory locality of the samples taken;
* Reducing stress on the GPU or CPU.
* Water surface reflections

==Origin==
Mipmapping was invented by Lance Williams in 1983 and is described in his paper &quot;Pyramidal parametrics&quot;. From the abstract: &quot;This paper advances a &#x27;pyramidal parametric&#x27; prefiltering and sampling geometry which minimizes aliasing effects and assures continuity within and between target images.&quot; The referenced pyramid can be imagined as the set of mipmaps stacked in front of each other.

The first patent issued on Mipmap and texture generation was in 1983 by Johnson Yan, Nicholas Szabo, and Lish-Yann Chen of Link Flight Simulation (Singer). Using their approach, texture could be generated and superimposed on surfaces (curvilinear and planar) of any orientation and could be done in real-time. Texture patterns could be modeled suggestive of the real world material they were intended to represent in a continuous way and free of aliasing, ultimately providing level of detail and gradual (imperceptible) detail level transitions. Texture generating became repeatable and coherent from frame to frame and remained in correct perspective and appropriate occultation. Because the application of real time texturing was applied to early three dimensional flight simulator CGI systems, and texture being a prerequsite for realistic graphics, this patent became widely cited and many of these techniques were later applied in graphics computing and gaming as applications expanded over the years.

The origin of the term mipmap is an initialism of the Latin phrase &quot;multum in parvo&quot; (&quot;much in little&quot;), and map, modeled on bitmap. The term &quot;pyramids&quot; is still commonly used in a GIS context. In GIS software, pyramids are primarily used for speeding up rendering times.

==Mechanism==
Each bitmap image of the mipmap set is a downsized duplicate of the main texture, but at a certain reduced level of detail. Although the main texture would still be used when the view is sufficient to render it in full detail, the renderer will switch to a suitable mipmap image (or in fact, interpolate between the two nearest, if trilinear filtering is activated) when the texture is viewed from a distance or at a small size. Rendering speed increases since the number of texture pixels (&quot;texels&quot;) being processed per display pixel can be much lower for similar results with the simpler mipmap textures. If using a limited number of texture samples per display pixel (as is the case with bilinear filtering) then artifacts are reduced since the mipmap images are effectively already anti-aliased. Scaling down and up is made more efficient with mipmaps as well.

If the texture has a basic size of 256 by 256 pixels, then the associated mipmap set may contain a series of 8 images, each one-fourth the total area of the previous one: 128×128 pixels, 64×64, 32×32, 16×16, 8×8, 4×4, 2×2, 1×1 (a single pixel). If, for example, a scene is rendering this texture in a space of 40×40 pixels, then either a scaled-up version of the 32×32 (without trilinear interpolation) or an interpolation of the 64×64 and the 32×32 mipmaps (with trilinear interpolation) would be used. The simplest way to generate these textures is by successive averaging; however, more sophisticated algorithms (perhaps based on signal processing and Fourier transforms) can also be used.
The increase in storage space required for all of these mipmaps is a third of the original texture, because the sum of the areas 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + ⋯ converges to 1/3. In the case of an RGB image with three channels stored as separate planes, the total mipmap can be visualized as fitting neatly into a square area twice as large as the dimensions of the original image on each side (twice as large on each side is four times the original area - one plane of the original size for each of red, green and blue makes three times the original area, and then since the smaller textures take 1/3 of the original, 1/3 of three is one, so they will take the same total space as just one of the original red, green, or blue planes). This is the inspiration for the tag &quot;multum in parvo&quot;.

==Anisotropic filtering==

When a texture is viewed at a steep angle, the filtering should not be uniform in each direction (it should be anisotropic rather than isotropic), and a compromise resolution is required. If a higher resolution is used, the cache coherence goes down, and the aliasing is increased in one direction, but the image tends to be clearer. If a lower resolution is used, the cache coherence is improved, but the image is overly blurry. This would be a tradeoff of MIP level of detail (LOD) for aliasing vs blurriness. However anisotropic filtering attempts to resolve this trade-off by sampling a non isotropic texture footprint for each pixel rather than merely adjusting the MIP LOD. This non isotropic texture sampling requires either a more sophisticated storage scheme or a summation of more texture fetches at higher frequencies.

==Summed-area tables==
Summed-area tables can conserve memory and provide more resolutions. However, they again hurt cache coherence, and need wider types to store the partial sums, which are larger than the base texture&#x27;s word size. Thus, modern graphics hardware does not support them.

<text>Vincent Saint John (1876–1929) was an American labor leader and prominent Wobbly, among the most influential radical labor leaders of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Vincent St. John was born in Newport, Kentucky and was the only son of New York City native Silas St. John and Irish immigrant Marian &quot;Mary&quot; Cecilia Magee. He had a sister two years younger named Helen.

The family moved frequently, Silas going wherever he could to find employment as a clerk or bookkeeper. St. John worked as a miner from the age of seventeen, moving to Telluride, Colorado in 1897. In 1900 St. John became president of the Western Federation of Miners&#x27; Union Local 63 at Telluride. He led the 1901 strike in that mining camp to a successful conclusion, gaining a standard minimum wage for the miners.

He was shadowed by Pinkertons hired by the Mine Operators&#x27; Association, stalked by gunmen, had a price on his head, was arrested and charged with crimes he never committed, and was condemned by the anti-labor press as a &quot;murderer.&quot;

Bulkeley Wells, a Telluride mining company president and manager who was &quot;born to privilege... [and was] convinced laborers were beneath him,&quot; was intent upon hanging St. John. Wells conspired with others, including Pinkerton manager James McParland, to accuse the head of the WFM local of conducting a &quot;reign of terror&quot; — and in particular, of murdering William J. Barney, a mine guard who had left his post. There was one significant complicating factor: Barney was not dead, but had merely failed to notify anyone that he had left.

On 5 November 1907 St. John was shot in Goldfield, Nevada by a conservative member of the Western Federation of Miners. The two bullets in his right wrist shattered the bone, crippling his hand. St. John was an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World and in 1908–1914 he led that union as the General Secretary. In January 1915 he retired to a small copper claim in New Mexico, but was later arrested for a May 1918 mass trial as the federal government brought sweeping indictments against 101 IWW members. St. John was not a member at that time, but the blanket indictments of hundreds of Wobblies brought blanket convictions, and St. John was sentenced to federal prison at Leavenworth. He was freed by President Warren G. Harding in 1923.

Vincent St. John died in San Francisco in June 1929 following a protracted illness. He is buried in Oakland, California.

<doc id="437174" wikidata="Q3634439" url="?curid=437174" title="Banu Abd-Shams">
<text>Banu Abd Shams () refers to a clan within the Meccan tribe of Quraysh.

==Ancestry==
The clan names itself after Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf, the son of Abd Manaf ibn Qusai and brother of Hashim ibn &#x27;Abd Manaf, who was the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He married Layla bint Asad ibn Abdal-Uzza, she bore four sons, Habib, Rabi&#x27;a, Abd Al-Uzza, Umayya and one daughter, Ruqayyah.

=== Banu Rabi&#x27;ah ===
Banu Rabi&#x27;ah was a branch that only had a few chiefs, they are:

1. Abu Hudhayfa Qays ibn &#x27;Utba

2. Hind bint Utbah

3. Walid ibn Utbah

4. Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah

5. Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa

6. Shaybah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah

==Notable members==
The following were members.
*Uthman, the third Muslim Caliph, son-in-law &amp; close Companion (Sahabi) of Muhammad. Uthman was the direct member of Banu Abd-Shams tribe through &quot;Banu Umayya&quot; clan.
*Arwa bint Kurayz, mother of caliph Uthman, female Companion &amp; first cousin of Muhammad.
*Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, chieftain
*Abu al-Aas ibn al-Rabee, companion and son-in-law of Muhammad and Khadija. Husband of Zainab bint Muhammad.
*Umamah bint Abi al-As, grand daughter of Muhammad and Khadija. Wife of fourth Muslim caliph and first shia Imam Ali 
*Walid ibn Utbah, son of Utbah
*Hind bint Utbah, daughter of Utbah
*Abu Hudhayfah ibn Utbah, son of Utbah and companion of Muhammad
*Shaybah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, brother of Utbah

===Connection with the Umayyads===
The clan acts as the parent clan to &quot;Banu Umayya&quot; (sub-clan) and Umayyad dynasty who ruled as the second Islamic Caliphate (661–750) established after Muhammad&#x27;s death. Umayya was the son of Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf. In pre-Islamic Arabia, the clan&#x27;s chieftain Utba ibn Rabi&#x27;ah&#x27;s daughter Hind bint Utbah was married to Umayyad leader Abu Sufyan ibn Harb.

==Modern day==
The clan has its descendants living today in a few cities of Central and Western Arabia.

==Banu Umayya==
Banu Umayya (, Nisba: al-Umawī) was a clan of the larger Quraysh tribe, which dominated Mecca in the pre-Islamic era. The Quraysh derived prestige among the Arab tribes through their protection and maintenance of the Kaʿba, which at the time was regarded by the largely polytheistic Arabs across the Arabian Peninsula as their most sacred sanctuary. A Qurayshite leader, Abd Manaf ibn Qusayy, who based on his place in the genealogical tradition would have lived in the late 5th century, was charged with the maintenance and protection of the Kaʿba and its pilgrims. These roles passed to his sons Abd Shams, Hashim and others. Abd Shams was the father of Umayya, the eponymous progenitor of the Umayyads.

Umayya succeeded Abd Shams as the &quot;qa&#x27;id&quot; (wartime commander) of the Meccans. This position was likely an occasional political post whose holder oversaw the direction of Mecca&#x27;s military affairs in times of war, instead of an actual field command. This early experience in military leadership proved instructive, as later Umayyads were known for possessing considerable political and military organizational skills. The historian Giorgio Levi Della Vida suggests that information in the early Arabic sources about Umayya, as with all the ancient progenitors of the tribes of Arabia, &quot;be accepted with caution&quot;, but &quot;that too great skepticism with regard to tradition would be as ill-advised as absolute faith in its statements&quot;. Della Vida asserts that since the Umayyads who appear at the beginning of Islamic history in the early 7th century were no later than third-generation descendants of Umayya, the latter&#x27;s existence is highly plausible.

By circa 600, the Quraysh had developed trans-Arabian trade networks, organizing caravans to Syria in the north and Yemen in the south. The Banu Umayya and the Banu Makhzum, another prominent Qurayshite clan, dominated these trade networks. They developed economic and military alliances with the nomadic Arab tribes that controlled the northern and central Arabian desert expanses, gaining them a degree of political power in Arabia.
===Adoption of Islam===
When the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a member of the Banu Hashim, a Qurayshite clan related to the Banu Umayya through their shared ancestor, Abd Manaf, began his religious teachings in Mecca, he was opposed by most of the Quraysh. He found support from the inhabitants of Medina and relocated there with his followers in 622. The descendants of Abd Shams, including the Umayyads, were among the principal leaders of Qurayshite opposition to Muhammad. They superseded the Banu Makhzum, led by Abu Jahl, as a result of the heavy losses that the Banu Makhzum&#x27;s leadership incurred fighting the Muslims at the Battle of Badr in 624. An Umayyad chief, Abu Sufyan, thereafter became the leader of the Meccan army that fought the Muslims under Muhammad at the battles of Uhud and the Trench.

Abu Sufyan and his sons, along with most of the Umayyads, embraced Islam toward the end of Muhammad&#x27;s life, following the Muslim conquest of Mecca. To secure the loyalty of prominent Umayyad leaders, including Abu Sufyan, Muhammad offered them gifts and positions of importance in the nascent Muslim state. He installed another Umayyad, Attab ibn Asid ibn Abi al-Is, as the first governor of Mecca. Although Mecca retained its paramountcy as a religious center, Medina continued to serve as the political center of the Muslims. Abu Sufyan and the Banu Umayya relocated to the city to maintain their growing political influence.

Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632 created a succession crisis, while nomadic tribes throughout Arabia that had embraced Islam defected from Medina&#x27;s authority. Abu Bakr, one of Muhammad&#x27;s oldest friends and an early convert to Islam, was elected caliph (paramount political and religious leader of the Muslim community). Abu Bakr showed favor to the Umayyads by awarding them a prominent role in the Muslim conquest of Syria. He appointed an Umayyad, Khalid ibn Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As, as commander of the expedition, but replaced him with other commanders, among whom was Abu Sufyan&#x27;s son, Yazid. Abu Sufyan had already owned property and maintained trade networks in Syria.

Abu Bakr&#x27;s successor, Caliph Umar (), while actively curtailing the influence of the Qurayshite elite in favor of Muhammad&#x27;s earlier supporters in the administration and military, did not disturb the growing foothold of Abu Sufyan&#x27;s sons in Syria, which was all but conquered by 638. When Umar&#x27;s overall commander over the province, Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, died in 639, he appointed Yazid governor of the Damascus, Palestine and Jordan districts of Syria. Yazid died shortly after and Umar installed his brother Mu&#x27;awiya in his place. Umar&#x27;s exceptional treatment of Abu Sufyan&#x27;s sons may have stemmed from his respect for the family, their burgeoning alliance with the powerful Banu Kalb tribe as a counterbalance to the influence of the Himyarite tribes who entered the Hims district during the conquest, or the lack of a suitable candidate at the time, particularly amid the plague of Amwas, which had already killed Abu Ubayda and Yazid.

<doc id="437210" wikidata="Q3516981" url="?curid=437210" title="Tecmo Bowl">
<text>is an American football video game developed and released by Tecmo. Originally released as an arcade game in 1987, the game features a large dual screen cabinet with up to four players between two fictitious teams. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in 1989 and was the first console game to include real National Football League players, via a license from the NFL Players Association. A Game Boy version developed by Sculptured Software followed in 1991. The NES version was extremely popular, spawning various sequels, starting with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot;. The NES original has been cited as one of the best sports video games ever made. The NES and arcade versions have been re-released (without the NFLPA license) for various platforms, including mobile phones, the Virtual Console, the NES Classic Edition, and Nintendo Switch.

==Gameplay==
The original arcade version is distinguished by a large two-monitor cabinet, support for up to four players, and the ability to break tackles. Only two fictional teams can be chosen: the Wildcats and the Bulldogs. Its 2D graphics are more advanced than the NES version, with a larger color palette and more detailed sprites.

The NES version allows two players to play rather than the arcade&#x27;s four players. The player can choose between three modes: one-player, two-player, and coach. In one-player mode, the player picks a football team and plays against the computer. After every game that the player wins, it is given a password to continue their quest for the championship and the computer picks another team to play as, and the player stays with the original choice. In the two-player and coach modes, the player and another human will play one game but the players only choose the plays in the coach mode (which cannot be done in the arcade version).

In both versions, the playbook consists of only four offensive plays. When on defense, a player selects a play based on the anticipation of the offense&#x27;s choice; if chosen correctly, it results in a collapse of the offensive line and well-covered receivers, therefore setting up either a potential sack or an interception.

Although featuring the names, rosters, and statistics of real National Football League (NFL) players from a mix of the 1987 and 1988 seasons, the gameplay limits how closely the video game players mimics real-life players. Unlike standard American football rules which have 11 players on each team, the arcade version only allows ten players on the field at a time and the NES version only allows nine for each. The offense tries to avoid the defense, and the defense tries to either avoid blockers, tackle the ball carrier, or intercept a pass.

===Teams===
&quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; contains twelve teams, each equipped with four plays. Most teams have two running plays and two passing plays. The exceptions are San Francisco and Miami, who have three passing plays and one running play.

Tecmo was not able an obtain an NFL league license to use real team names, as that had been given to LJN&#x27;s NFL video game for the NES. As a result, the teams in the game are identified solely by their home city or state, but through the NFLPA license, each roster mimics that of the NFL team based out of the same city or state. &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; only uses players from twelve of the best and most popular teams of the time.

The teams featured in the game are Indianapolis, Miami, Cleveland, Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles (Raiders), Washington, San Francisco, Dallas, New York (Giants), Chicago, and Minnesota.

Each team has a different level of effectiveness based on its personnel and play selection.

Two NES versions were released in the U.S. The first is identified by its black and gold seal of quality, Eric Dickerson as running back, and Albert Bentley as a kick returner for Indianapolis. The second is identified by its white and gold seal, Albert Bentley as running back, and Clarence Verdin as a kick returner. One year later, the Famicom version has many roster changes (from the same twelve teams available in the North American version) to reflect being released during the real 1990 NFL season.

According to Tecmo USA&#x27;s Dimitri Criona, the game was a smash hit in American arcades and an even bigger hit for the Nintendo Entertainment System, becoming a cultural phenomenon in the United States. As of June 2007, the &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; series had sold 5 million units worldwide.

&quot;Sinclair User&quot; reviewed the arcade game in 1988, scoring it 8 out of 10. They called it a &quot;superb&quot; game that significantly improved on earlier American football games such as &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; (1983).

In the September 1997 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, twelve staff members voted in a list for the top 100 games of all time, putting &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; at 30th place. Both GameSpot and &quot;Time&quot; have also listed &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; for the NES in their lists of all-time greatest video games. &quot;Time&quot; noted that the arcade-like controls and &quot;quasi-realistic teams and players&quot; made it a &quot;breakout hit that&#x27;s still fun to pick up and play to this very day&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; placed the game 38th on its top 100 video games of all time in 2001.

===Bo Jackson character===
Bo Jackson&#x27;s character in Tecmo Bowl was called the &quot;greatest video game athlete of all-time&quot; by &quot;ESPN&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. Some gamers claimed that Jackson&#x27;s character could run for as many as 1,000 yards in a single game.

&quot;TechTimes&quot; noted that the game&#x27;s character of Bo Jackson was &quot;[a]bsolutely, positively—and absurdly—unstoppable&quot;, reflecting the real Jackson&#x27;s extraordinary athletic abilities. Players considered using Jackson as effectively cheating within the game. Lawrence Taylor&#x27;s character was used similarly on defense.

In Family Guy Season 14, episode 19 “Run, Chris, Run” Peter plays as Bo Jackson.

===&quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; documentary===
A documentary feature about the best Tecmo Bowl players in the world was shot in 2022 by CJ Wallis. The film takes place in Omaha, Nebraska where the National Championship takes place every year and features Super Bowl winning quarterback Jim McMahon and SEC host Cole Cubelic.

<text>Ramsey Emmanuel Lewis Jr. (May 27, 1935 – September 12, 2022) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and radio personality. Lewis recorded over 80 albums and received five gold records and three Grammy Awards in his career. His album &quot;The In Crowd&quot; earned Lewis critical praise and the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance. His best known singles include &quot;The &#x27;In&#x27; Crowd&quot;, &quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, and &quot;Sun Goddess&quot;. Until 2009, he was the host of the &quot;Ramsey Lewis Morning Show&quot; on the Chicago radio station WNUA.

Lewis was also active in musical education in Chicago. He founded the Ramsey Lewis Foundation, established the Ravinia&#x27;s Jazz Mentor Program, and served on the board of trustees for the Merit School of Music and The Chicago High School for the Arts.

== Life and career ==

Ramsey Emmanuel Lewis Jr. was born on May 27, 1935, in Chicago to Ramsey 
Emmanuel Lewis and Pauline Lewis. He grew up in the Cabrini–Green Homes Housing Projects, an area native to soul singers Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler. Both of his parents came from the Deep South. His father was a church choir director who encouraged him to study music. Thus, Lewis began taking piano lessons at the age of four with Ernestine Bruce, the church pianist and organist. 
When he was 11, Bruce recommended he study with Dorothy Mendelssohn at the Chicago Musical College. Mendelssohn taught him classical technique with the philosophy that &quot;it freed the performer from the thinking about the notes so he could concentrate on the music.&quot; Lewis realized what she meant when he saw Wynton Kelly with the Miles Davis group, Kelly asked him to play something, and Kelly complimented him by saying &quot;Boy, I wish I had technique.&quot;

As a young man, Lewis played with a number of local ensembles, such as Edward Virgil Abner&#x27;s Knights of Music. Lewis would eventually join a jazz group called the clefs. He later formed the Ramsey Lewis Trio with drummer Isaac &quot;Redd&quot; Holt and bassist Eldee Young. They eventually signed to Chess Records.

In 1956, the trio released their debut album, &quot;Ramsey Lewis and his Gentle-men of Swing&quot;.

Following their 1965 hit, &quot;The &#x27;In&#x27; Crowd&quot; (the single reached No. 5 on the pop charts, and the album No. 2), they concentrated more on pop material. Young and Holt left in 1966 to form Young-Holt Unlimited and were replaced by Cleveland Eaton and Maurice White. White left to form Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and was replaced by Morris Jennings in 1970. Later, Frankie Donaldson and Bill Dickens replaced Jennings and Eaton; Felton Crews also appeared on Lewis&#x27; 1981 album &quot;Three Piece Suite&quot;.

By 1966, Lewis was one of the nation&#x27;s most successful jazz pianists, having had hits with &quot;The In Crowd&quot;, &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot;, and &quot;Wade in the Water.&quot; All three singles each sold over one million copies and were awarded gold discs. In the 1970s, Lewis often played electric piano, although by later in the decade he was sticking to acoustic piano and using an additional keyboardist in his groups.

In addition to recording and performing, Lewis hosted the weekly syndicated radio program &quot;Legends of Jazz&quot;, created in 1990, syndicated by United Stations Radio Networks. He also hosted the &quot;Ramsey Lewis Morning Show&quot; on Chicago &quot;smooth jazz&quot; radio station WNUA (95.5 FM). In December 2006, this morning show became part of Broadcast Architecture&#x27;s Smooth Jazz Network, simulcasting on other smooth jazz stations across the country until its cancellation in May 2009, when WNUA switched over to a Spanish format.

Ramsey founded the Ramsey Lewis Foundation, which promoted musical instrument education to children, in 2005.

In 2006, a well-received 13-episode &quot;Legends of Jazz&quot; television series hosted by Lewis was broadcast on public TV nationwide and featured live performances by a variety of jazz artists including Larry Gray, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Joey Defrancesco, Dave Brubeck, Chick Corea, Kurt Elling, Benny Golson, Pat Metheny, and Tony Bennett.

Lewis was artistic director of Jazz at Ravinia (an annual feature at the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Illinois) and helped organize Ravinia&#x27;s Jazz Mentor Program. Ramsey also served on the board of trustees for the Merit School of Music and The Chicago High School for the Arts.

== Distinctions, honors, awards ==
Lewis was an honorary member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. In May 2008, Lewis received an honorary doctorate from Loyola University Chicago upon delivering the keynote address at the undergraduate commencement ceremony.

In January 2007, the Dave Brubeck Institute invited Lewis to join its Honorary Board of Friends at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. Lewis was an Honorary Board member of the Chicago Jazz Orchestra.

== Personal life ==
From 1954 to 1988, Lewis was married to Geraldine Taylor (1935–2005), with whom he had seven children. In 1990, he married Jan Tamillow. His sisters, Gloria Johnson (1941–2021) and Lucille Jackson (1932–2012), served as music minister and co-pastor respectively, at the James Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church in Maywood, Illinois. On September 12, 2022, Lewis passed away in his sleep at his home in Chicago at age 87.

<text>Ruby Vroom is the debut studio album by American rock band Soul Coughing, released in 1994. The album&#x27;s sound is a mixture of sample-based tunes (loops of Raymond Scott&#x27;s &quot;Powerhouse&quot; on &quot;Bus to Beelzebub&quot;, Toots and the Maytals, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, the Andrews Sisters, and the Roches on &quot;Down to This&quot;, and a loop of sampler player Mark Degli Antoni&#x27;s orchestral horns on &quot;Screenwriter&#x27;s Blues&quot;, among others). It also features guitar-based tunes like &quot;Janine&quot;, &quot;Moon Sammy&quot;, and &quot;Supra Genius&quot; and jazzy, upright-bass-fueled songs that often slyly quoted other material—the theme from &quot;Courageous Cat&quot; on &quot;Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago&quot;, Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;Misterioso&quot; on &quot;Casiotone Nation&quot;, and Bobby McFerrin&#x27;s cover of Joan Armatrading&#x27;s &quot;Opportunity&quot; on &quot;Uh, Zoom Zip&quot;. On September 12th 2024, the band announced on Jimmy Kimmel Live that a remastered 30th anniversary version of the album would be released on CD and vinyl, which includes bonus songs from the era. 

The album sold approximately 70,000 copies, as of April 1996, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;.

== Title ==
&quot;Ruby&quot; was named after a mispronunciation of the name of Ruby Froom, daughter of record producer Mitchell Froom—a frequent collaborator of &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; producer Tchad Blake—and singer/songwriter Suzanne Vega.

== Recording ==
The album was recorded at Sunset Sound Factory in Hollywood, Blake and Froom&#x27;s usual haunt—a storage room near the studio&#x27;s lounge was filled with vintage keyboards and road cases filled with toys—whistles, baby rattles, children&#x27;s toy xylophones. Many of these ended up in the songs, such as a train whistle played by Doughty on &quot;Uh, Zoom Zip&quot;. This was in keeping with Tchad Blake&#x27;s spirit of maverick experimentation, which included sticking a binaural head-shaped microphone in front of Yuval Gabay&#x27;s drumkit, sticking a mic in a car muffler, called &quot;the Bone&quot; and sticking that in the drum booth as well, and having Doughty improvise wild, yelling ad-libs on &quot;Casiotone Nation&quot;, singing into a cheap amplification system called an Ahuja that Blake bought in India. The speaker was essentially a huge bullhorn atop a stick.

The album&#x27;s lone guest is Rachel Benbow Murdy, band founder Mike Doughty&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, who supplies a vocal on &quot;Janine&quot;. Doughty had Murdy go out to a payphone in Sheridan Square in New York and sing a rendition of &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; with an improvised melody into their answering machine. Recorded a year before the &quot;Ruby&quot; sessions, Doughty and bass player Sebastian Steinberg recorded the tune at the avant-garde jazz club The Knitting Factory during the daytime, when the club was closed, with club soundperson James McLean. McLean put a mic on the answering machine, which Doughty had brought to the session.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; was positively received by critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;elegantly spare, dramatic, and danceable&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Michael Azerrad applauded Soul Coughing for combining its disparate genre influences into &quot;a compelling and profoundly original sound&quot;. The sampling work of keyboardist Mark de Gli Antoni was singled out for particular praise: Michael Azerrad stated that Antoni &quot;revolutionize[d] what sampling can do as a rhythmic, harmonic, textural and melodic tool&quot;, while Sean Westergaard of AllMusic opined that he &quot;set the bar for sampler players in the pop world&quot;. Vocalist Mike Doughty was also praised for his work, with critics noting that he was able to effectively balance wry cynicism against earnest descriptiveness. Robert Christgau argued that, on &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot;, Soul Coughing demonstrated stronger musicianship than other acts who shared the band&#x27;s &quot;hipster cynicism&quot;.

In a retrospective review from AllMusic, &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; was labeled &quot;one of the great debut albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

<text>The Ford Mainline is an automobile which was produced by Ford in the United States in the models years 1952 to 1956. It was introduced as the base trim level of the 1952 Ford range below the Customline and Crestline models. The Mainline retained its position in the redesigned 1955 Ford range but was discontinued for the 1957 model year when the Ford Custom became the new base model.
==Mainline Styles==
The Mainline was offered in 2-door sedan, 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe and 2-door station wagon body styles. The station wagon was marketed as the Mainline Ranch Wagon until it lost its Mainline tag for the 1955 model year when all Ford wagons were moved to their own series. Mainlines were available with both inline six-cylinder and V8 engines.

==Australian Ford Mainline Utility==
In Australia the Mainline name was applied to a locally developed 2-door coupé utility version of the Ford Customline sedan from 1952. The Mainline utilized an imported station wagon chassis with a large X-member from the Ford Sunliner convertible added for additional load carrying strength. It sold alongside the Australian built Customline sedan, with both given yearly updates until production ceased in 1959. The Mainline&#x27;s position in Ford Australia&#x27;s lineup was filled by the first Ford Falcon utility the following year. The Mainline like the Customline was a more expensive premium product in the Australian market. The Mainline Utility was powered by an Australian produced version of the Ford side-valve V8 engine until the introduction of the OHV V8 in the redesigned 1955 series.

<doc id="437245" wikidata="Q31107" url="?curid=437245" title="Hattic language">
<text>Hattic, or Hattian, was a non-Indo-European agglutinative language spoken by the Hattians in Asia Minor in the 2nd millennium BC. Scholars call the language &quot;Hattic&quot; to distinguish it from Hittite, the Indo-European language of the Hittite Empire. The Hittites referred to the language as &quot;hattili&quot; (there are no attestations of the name of the language in Hattic itself), related to the Assyrian and Egyptian designation of an area west of the Euphrates as &quot;Land of the Hatti&quot; (Khatti). 

The heartland of the oldest attested language of Anatolia before the arrival of Hittite-speakers, ranged from Hattusa, then called &quot;Hattus&quot;, northward to Nerik. Other cities mentioned in Hattic include Tuhumiyara and Tissaruliya. Hittite-speakers conquered Hattus from Kussara to its south in the 18th century BC. They absorbed or replaced the Hattic-speaking ruling class (Hattians) but retained the name &quot;Hatti&quot; for the region. The name of the inhabitants of that area is likewise identified with the Biblical Heth, from which, in turn, the English word &quot;Hittite&quot; is derived.

==Classification==

Certain similarities between Hattic and both Abkhazo-Adyghean and Kartvelian languages have led to proposals by some scholars about the possibility of a linguistic bloc from central Anatolia to the Caucasus. According to Alexey Kassian, there are also possible lexical correspondences between Hattic and Yeniseian languages, as well as Burushaski language; for instance, &quot;tongue&quot; is &quot;alef&quot; in Hattic and &quot;alup&quot; in Kott, &quot;moon&quot; is &quot;kap&quot; in Hattic and &quot;qīp&quot; in Ket, &quot;mountain&quot; is &quot;ziš&quot; in Hattic and &quot;ćhiṣ&quot; in Burushaski (compare also with &quot;*čɨʔs&quot; – a Proto-Yeniseian word for &quot;stone&quot;).

==Corpus==

No document has been found in which native Hattic-speakers wrote their own language. Scholars must rely on indirect sources or mentions by their neighbours and successors, the Hittites. Some Hattic words can be found in religious tablets of Hittite priests that date from the 14th and the 13th centuries BC. The passages contained, between the lines of the text signs, the explanation &quot;the priest is now speaking in Hattic&quot;.

Roots of Hattic words can also be found in the names of mountains, rivers, cities and gods. Other Hattic words can be found in some mythological texts.

All published Hattic documents are catalogued in the &quot;Catalogue des textes hittites&quot; (CTH). Documents from Hattusa span CTH 725–745. Of these CTH 728, 729, 731, 733, and 736 are Hattic/Hittite bilinguals. CTH 737 is a Hattic incantation for the festival at Nerik. One key, if fragmentary, bilingual is the story of &quot;The Moon God Who Fell from the Sky&quot;. (There are additional Hattic texts in Sapinuwa, which had not been published as of 2004.)

== Grammar ==
Hattic has been claimed to form conventional plurals with a prefix: &quot;children&quot; = ; however, most specialists today consider it to be a possessive pronominal clitic, meaning &quot;his&quot; or &quot;their&quot;. It formed a collective plural by attaching the prefix : &quot;gods&quot;.

The genitive case was declined with the suffix ( &quot;land&quot; but &quot;of the land&quot;). Some linguists like Polomé and Winter have claimed that the accusative case was marked with and give the example of &quot;word&quot;, but that has been identified by others as a pronominal clitic, meaning &quot;their&quot;.

== Vocabulary ==
Some known Hattic words include:
* = &quot;tongue&quot;
* = &quot;god&quot;
* = &quot;humankind, population&quot;
* = &quot;house&quot;
* = &quot;wine&quot; (found in the compound &quot;findu-qqaram&quot; &quot;wine-ladle&quot;)
* = &quot;land&quot;
* = &quot;King of the Land&quot;, the Hattic war god
* = Hattic sun goddess
* = Hattic throne goddess
* = &quot;temple&quot;
* = the Hattic moon god
* = &quot;king&quot;
* = &quot;to sit&quot;
* = &quot;child&quot;
* = &quot;mortal&quot;
* = &quot;to put&quot;

<doc id="437249" wikidata="Q2438997" url="?curid=437249" title="51st (Highland) Division">
<text>The 51st (Highland) Division was an infantry division of the British Army that fought on the Western Front in France during the First World War from 1915 to 1918. The division was raised in 1908, upon the creation of the Territorial Force, as the Highland Division and later 51st (Highland) Division from 1915. The division&#x27;s insignia was a stylised &#x27;HD&#x27; inside a red circle. Early doubts about the division&#x27;s performance earned it the nickname of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Duds&quot; after the name of its commander, Major-General George Harper although they would go on to gain a fearsome reputation with the Allies and Germans.

The division was renamed the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and fought during the Second World War as part of the Territorial Army after the Territorial Force was disbanded in 1920. In June 1940, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was attached to French 10th Army and after a fighting retreat from the Somme the greater part of the division was forced to surrender, having been cut off at St Valery-en-Caux on the Channel coast. In North Africa, the reconstituted Highland Division was nicknamed the &quot;Highway Decorators&quot; in reference to the &#x27;HD&#x27; insignia that adorned road signs along their axis of advance.

By December 1947, the formation amalgamated with 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division to become 51st/52nd Scottish Division, but, by March 1950, 51st Division and 52nd Division had been recreated as separate formations. 51st (Highland) Division finally disbanded in 1968.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the Highland Division. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was at 2 Charlotte Street in Perth.

==First World War==
The First World War doubts were the result of the way in which the division was initially plundered in late 1914 to early 1915, during a period of great strain on the Regular Army troops of the original British Expeditionary Force (BEF), serving on the Western Front. In August 1914, upon mobilization, the division&#x27;s infantry element had comprised 12 battalions in 3 regimentally-named brigades: the Seaforth and Cameron Brigade, the Gordon Highlanders Brigade and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Brigade. A crisis on the Western Front in late 1914 saw increasing numbers of individual TF battalions being seconded to Regular Army formations on the Western Front. The first TF formation to be plundered in this way was the 1st London Division.

By early 1915, the Highland Division had lost six of its 12 pre-war Highland infantry battalions to Regular divisions. When TF divisions were finally ordered overseas as complete formations in their own right in early 1915, the Highland Division was only at half-strength and in no shape to be sent abroad at that time. Only by the last-minute addition of two Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) battalions and the North Lancashire Brigade from the West Lancashire Division was the division, now numbered as the 51st (Highland) Division, considered numerically complete and was rushed to the Western Front in May 1915 to help stem the latest German onslaught during the Second Battle of Ypres. Obviously, the lack of familiarity amongst these newly introduced disparate units hampered division efficiency and the division could only fare moderately in the further actions at Festubert and Givenchy. Lieutenant General Sir Douglas Haig, then commanding the British First Army, and later to command the entire BEF, commented that the 51st was, at the time of Festubert, &quot;practically untrained and very green in all field duties&quot;. Moved to the quiet Somme front in the late summer of 1915, the division, now under the command of Major General George Harper, had yet to satisfy the expectations of those expecting the familiar Highland flair– this was the period of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Duds&quot;.

The situation was only resolved when, in January 1916, the Lancashire Brigade (by then renumbered the 154th (3rd Highland) Brigade and later became the 164th (North Lancashire) Brigade) left the division and their place was filled by original Highland battalions released by the regular divisions and by battalions of the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) not originally in the division. Given the chance to show their mettle in July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, they assaulted High Wood, which they attacked forcefully in the midst of a murderous field of fire without shelter. Though they failed to take the position, they had shown the fighting spirit expected of Highlanders. The division&#x27;s reputation grew and they were chosen to capture the notorious fortress village of Beaumont-Hamel in November 1916, towards the end of the Somme offensive. The 51st were &quot;&quot;Harper&#x27;s Duds&quot; no longer. Legend has it the Germans came to know them as &quot;The Ladies From Hell&quot;&quot;.

By 1917, the 51st was considered a leading assault division and was handed more and more difficult tasks, throughout the year, from Arras in April/May to the combined tank-infantry assault at Cambrai in November.

By early 1918, the division, as with numerous others in the BEF at the time, was below-strength due to losses in 1917 and the tired survivors were given a quiet part of the front line to hold. Unfortunately, the Germans had by chance chosen that location as one of the focal points for their Kaiserschlacht, the last great German assault on the West in March 1918, intended to win the war before the American Expeditionary Forces could arrive in great numbers. The neighbouring Portuguese Expeditionary Corps bore the brunt of the initial German assault. When Portuguese troops started to retire from their positions and ran across the 51st&#x27;s positions, they were mistaken for Germans in the poor visual conditions and the 51st opened fire on them, causing casualties. The under-strength 51st was also pushed back, but eventually held as the German offensive ebbed and flowed. The remains of the division survived the Spring battles and received replacements in time for Haig&#x27;s Allied offensives of August 1918 onward, which saw the war coming to an end on 11 November 1918.

During 1918, members of the division were painted by the war artist Frederick Farrell, in France.

==Inter-war period==
At the end of the First World War, the Territorial Force was stood down. It was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1921, resulting in the creation of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division.

==Second World War==
===France 1940===
Major-General Victor Fortune took command of the division in 1937. In common with the rest of the British Army at the time, training and equipment had been insufficient in the years after World War 1. In 1938, after Chamberlain&#x27;s visit to Munich, the decision had been taken to double the size of the Territorial Army, and the Highland Division had made good progress with this recruitment by the spring of 1939.

The issue of equipment and the associated training remained a problem. For example: two years of regular army infantry training was compressed into 3 months; some mortar units had no experience with live ammunition until they got to the firing ranges in France; Bren gun carrier crews only received their equipment in the summer of 1939, leaving little time for training in operating and tactics.

With the situation regarding Nazi Germany deteriorating and the threat of war on the rise, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was mobilised on 24 August 1939. In preparation for joining the BEF in France, the division travelled from Scotland to Aldershot, where it received final equipping and training. All units had arrived at Aldershot by 16 September 1939. The men were required to wear the standard British Army battledress of the day. The War Office had decided that kilts were not suited to modern mechanised warfare and did not provide protection in the event of a gas attack. Thus the men were required to hand in their kilts before embarking for France.

In mid-January 1940 the division departed from Southampton and disembarked at the French port of Le Havre. On 28 January it came under command of I Corps of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), under Lieutenant-General Michael Barker. His command also included the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions, both Regular Army formations.

In February and March the 51st Division underwent a major reorganisation as per policies of the BEF. Some of the division&#x27;s units were replaced by Regular Army formations. This was done with the intention of strengthening inexperienced Territorial divisions. The 23rd Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery, a Regular Army unit, replaced the 76th (Highland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, as one example of the changes made. The 76th (Highland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery was transferred to the 3rd Infantry Division. On 22 April 1940 the 51st Division was detached from the rest of the BEF to come under command of the French Third Army. The division was stationed in front of the Ouvrage Hackenberg fortress of the Maginot Line.

With the German invasion of France and the low countries on 10 May 1940 the BEF advanced into Belgium to meet the advancing German forces. Stationed to the south in front of the Maginot Line, the 51st Division was not a part of the force involved in Belgium, and was thus not involved in the Dunkirk evacuation. In response to the German advance it was pulled back to form a defensive line along the Somme, where it was attached to the French Tenth Army. With the withdrawal of Allied forces at Dunkirk, the Germans turned their attention to the south.

On 5 June they began their second offensive. The 51st was tasked with holding a line four times longer than that which would normally be expected of a division. Sustained attacks over 5–6 June caused heavy losses, particularly among the 7th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, where the main weight of the German attack fell. The Argylls&#x27; losses were the worst they had suffered in their history. The other battalions of the 154th Brigade were enveloped. The remnant of the 154th Brigade was forced to retire to the west.

Meanwhile, the 152nd and 153rd Brigades, along with the French 9th Corps, under Lieutenant General Marcel Ihler, were cut off from the main Allied forces, and had to withdraw toward Le Havre for a possible evacuation by sea. The 154th Brigade was detached to form &quot;Arkforce&quot; and tasked with maintaining an open line of communication with Le Havre. As the force moved back toward the coast German forces reached the coast area near Saint-Valery-en-Caux first, cutting off the line of retreat to Le Havre. The French and British force pulled back into Saint Valery-en-Caux.

With steep cliffs overlooking the small harbour, the Germans had a ready line of fire to use against any attempts to withdraw. General Fortune could not hold out much longer, and realized their last chance was to be pulled off in the dark on the night of 11/12 June, but no ships came. (The Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, Admiral William James, had assembled ships for the evacuation but daytime evacuation was impossible and on the final night fog meant that the ships could not communicate and co-ordination would be impossible.) On the morning of 12 June the French forces surrendered, followed 30 minutes later by the British. Major-General Fortune was one of the most senior British officers to be taken prisoner in the war.

After the war was over, General Fortune was knighted by King George VI for his work in promoting the welfare of his men while in captivity: despite failing health, he had resisted repatriation. From the British point of view, the defeat of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was the end of the Allied resistance during the Battle of France.

More than 10,000 members of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division were taken prisoner at St Valery. They were marched to Germany, via Belgium, following the route over which the Germans had advanced against them. The officers were separated from the men, for most of whom the initial destination was Stalag XX-A at Toruń, about northwest of Warsaw. Some were loaded into canal barges for part of their journey, but all eventually travelled by train in cattle wagons. There were some notable escapes, mostly in the early stages of the march. Of the 290 British Army POW escapers who had returned to Britain by the end of June 1941, 134 were members of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division.

As other camps were brought into operation, a large proportion of the POWs were transferred – most to Stalag XX-B at Malbork and Stalag 344 at Lambinowice, but with small numbers in many other camps.

Early in 1945, the Russian Army had advanced close to these camps, so the POWs were involved in the &quot;March of 1945&quot;. Some groups from Stalag XX-A marched around in the depths of winter to Stalag XIB/357 at Bad Fallingbostel on the Lüneburg Heath, north of Hanover. Others had similar journeys in severe winter conditions, affected by shortages of food and shelter, with many suffering from dysentery and frostbite.

In 1942 French General Charles de Gaulle, in a speech, claimed &quot;I can tell you that the comradeship in arms experienced on the battlefield of Abbeville in May and June 1940 between the French armoured division which I had the honour to command and the valiant 51st Highland Division under General Fortune played its part in the decision which I took to continue fighting on the side of the Allies unto the end, no matter what the course of events.&quot;

On 12 June 2010, veterans of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attended a commemorative ceremony for the 70th Anniversary of the battle at Saint-Valéry-en-Caux.

===Reformation===
In August 1940, the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division (the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division&#x27;s 2nd Line Territorial Army duplicate, which it had helped form) was re-designated as the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. As part of this, the 26th and 27th Infantry Brigades were re-designated the 152nd and 153rd Infantry Brigade. The 28th Infantry Brigade was merged with the severely understrength 154th Infantry Brigade.

The first general officer commanding (GOC) of the new incarnation of the division was Major-General Alan Cunningham, who, in October 1940, was sent to the Middle East. He was replaced by Major-General Neil Ritchie. Almost two years of home defence and training duties followed on the south coast of England and northeast coast of Scotland against a potential German invasion, which never arrived.

In June 1941, Major-General Ritchie was sent to the Middle East and Major-General Douglas Wimberley, who had served with the original 51st (Highland) Division during the First World War and more recently commanded the 152nd Brigade, assumed command. With the arrival of Wimberley as GOC, strenuous training for future operations overseas began. By June 1942, the division was ordered to prepare for service overseas.

===The Mediterranean and Middle-East===
Arriving in North Africa in August 1942, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division experienced its first fighting at the Second Battle of El Alamein (October–November), sustaining some 2,000 casualties. It then played a major part in &quot;Operation Lightfoot&quot;, where it was in the centre of the Northern Push, between the 9th Australian Division and the 2nd New Zealand Division. It faced the German 21st Panzer Division and some Italian units. Initially unsuccessful during Lightfoot, the minefields it cleared were key in achieving a breakout during &quot;Operation Supercharge&quot;.

Subsequently, the division was involved in many battles of the Tunisian Campaign, including the battle of Wadi Akarit, in early April 1943, and took part in the frontal assault on strongpoints guarded by deep minefields, where it was on the far right of the line. The Commanding Officer (CO) of the 7th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, Lieutenant Colonel Lorne MacLaine Campbell, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership during the battle. The war in North Africa ended on 13 May 1943 with the surrender of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs). Throughout the fighting in North Africa the division served under the command of the British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery.

Later the 51st Division had a rest to absorb replacements for the heavy losses, in both manpower and materiel, suffered in North Africa and began training in amphibious warfare. In July, the division took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, suffering comparatively light casualties in the short campaign, which lasted for 38 days. Towards the end of the campaign in early August, the division was withdrawn from combat and held in reserve for the Allied invasion of Italy. Although the 51st Division as a whole did not take part in the invasion, some of the division&#x27;s artillery helped support Operation Baytown, the Eighth Army&#x27;s crossing of the Strait of Messina in Sicily to the Italian &quot;toe&quot; at Reggio Calabria.

The division was then recalled from the Eighth Army and returned to the United Kingdom, on the wishes of the Army&#x27;s old commander, General Montgomery, together with the veteran 7th Armoured and 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Divisions, to prepare for the opening of the Second Front in June 1944. Montgomery commented on the 51st &quot;Of the many fine divisions that served under me in the Second World War, none were finer than the Highland Division&quot; and later &quot;&quot;It was the only infantry division in the armies of the British Empire that accompanied me during the whole of the long march from Alamein to Berlin&quot;.&quot;

When a group of recuperating wounded soldiers of the 51st returned from their North African hospital to rejoin the division in Sicily, they were instead split up and ordered to various units and formations, mainly the British 46th Infantry Division which had suffered heavy casualties during the Salerno landings, totally unrelated to the 51st Division or its component regiments. Some soldiers of the division regarded this as administrative high-handedness and refused to follow these orders, and the result was the Salerno Mutiny. The mutineers were distributed to various units regardless, while ringleaders were sentenced to death (the sentences were later commuted and finally quashed).

===Battle of Normandy===
Most of the 51st landed in Normandy as part of Operation Overlord on 7 June 1944, a day after D-Day, as part of British I Corps, under Lieutenant-General John Crocker. After spending a brief period supporting the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, it was sent across the River Orne, and spent two months supporting the 6th Airborne Division in its bridgehead. During this period it fought many difficult actions at places such as Bréville (11–12 June) and Colombelles (11 July).

The 51st (Highland) Infantry Division&#x27;s performance in Normandy was, overall, considered disappointing, particularly by General Montgomery, now the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied land forces in Normandy, who stated in a telegram to Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS, the professional head of the British Army), that the division &quot;had failed every mission it was given&quot;. This led to the replacement of its GOC, Major-General Charles Bullen-Smith; his dismissal is not mentioned in the Divisional Official History nor formation accounts. His successor was Major-General Tom Rennie, who had served with the division in France, North Africa and Sicily before being elevated to command of the British 3rd Infantry Division for the Normandy invasion, which he commanded until being wounded soon after D-Day, but had now recovered.

On 1 August 1944 the division, along with the rest of British I Corps, became part of the newly activated Canadian First Army. The division fought alongside this army in &quot;Operation Totalize&quot;, before advancing to Lisieux. It then continued east over the River Seine and headed, on General Montgomery&#x27;s orders for Saint-Valéry-en-Caux, the scene of the division&#x27;s surrender in June 1940. The division&#x27;s massed pipes and drums played in the streets of the town, and a parade included veterans of the 1940 campaign in France who were with the 51st Division in 1944.

A similar event occurred at Dieppe when it was liberated by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. Leaving Saint Valéry, the 51st Division was engaged in &quot;Operation Astonia&quot;, the battle for the French port of Le Havre, in September 1944.

===After Normandy===
After the capture of the town of Le Havre, the division went on to take part in Operation Pheasant in October 1944, finally passing into reserve and garrisoning the Meuse River during the Battle of the Bulge, now as part of XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks. It was not involved in heavy fighting during the early stages of the battle and was deployed as a stopgap in case the Germans broke through.

In January 1945, the division, along with the rest of XXX Corps, helped to cut off the northern tip of the German salient, linking up with the U.S. 84th Infantry Division at Nisramont on 14 January. Following this, the division was involved in Operation Veritable, the clearing of the Rhineland. In late March the 51st took part in Operation Turnscrew within the framework of Operation Plunder, the crossing of the River Rhine, near the town of Rees, where the GOC, Major General Tom Rennie, was killed by enemy mortar fire. He was replaced by Major General Gordon MacMillan, a very highly experienced and competent commander who had previously been the GOC of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division.

The division advanced through Germany and ended the war in the Bremerhaven area of Northern Germany. During the North-West Europe campaign the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division had suffered a total of 19,524 battle casualties.

==Post War==
A related formation, the 51st (Scottish) Division, was reformed in the Territorial Army after the Second World War. Beckett 2008 says that Territorial Army units that were in suspended animation were formally reactivated on 1 January 1947, though no personnel were assigned until commanding officers and permanent staff had been appointed in March and April 1947. By December 1947, the formation amalgamated with 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division to become 51st/52nd Scottish Division, but, by March 1950, 51st Division and 52nd Division had been recreated as separate formations.

From December 1955, the division was placed on a lower establishment, for home defence purposes only. On 1 May 1961, the division was merged with Highland District to become 51st Highland Division/District. 51st (Highland) Division was disbanded in 1968.

==Legacy==
A specific memorial to the 51st division created by the sculptor George Henry Paulin exists at the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site on the Somme.

A further memorial in the form of a sculpture by Alan Herriot was unveiled in May 1995 on the North Inch in Perth, Scotland. As well as commemorating 50 years of peace in Europe, the sculpture depicts a Highlander being greeted by a young Dutch girl during the liberation of the Netherlands by the 51st.

===Music===
* &quot;The 51st (Highland) Division&#x27;s Farewell to Sicily&quot;, a folk song written by Hamish Henderson, a former officer who served in the 51st Division during the Sicilian campaign. It has been recorded by a number of folk singers, including Dick Gaughan.
* &quot;The Beaches of St. Valery&quot;, performed by the Battlefield Band. Written by Davy Steele, it tells the story of the 51st Division&#x27;s struggle to reach Saint-Valéry-en-Caux in 1940 only to find that no ships had been sent to evacuate them.
* &quot;The Old Boys&quot;, performed by the Scottish group Runrig, who sing in both English and Gaelic. The song which first appeared on the album Recovery (1981) and was reprised on Protera (2003) speaks of the declining numbers of Gaelic speaking members of the 51st who fought at St Valery.
* &quot;Farewell, 51st, farewell!&quot;, a folk song written by Andy Stewart, about scrapping of the 51st Division, but indicates that they will never be forgotten, as the lyrics say &quot;On the glory road of fame, there is honour tae your name. Farewell 51st, Farewell.&quot;
* &quot;The 51st Highland Division&quot;, a 4/4 march composed by Pipe Major Donald Mac leod.
* &quot;The 51st Highland Division Farewell&quot;, a 2/4 march composed by Dr. Charles Bannatyne.
* &quot;The 51st Highland Division at Wadi Akarit&quot;, a 2/4 march composed by W. Mac Donald.

===Dance===
* &quot;The Reel of the 51st Division&quot; was devised in the Laufen PoW camp by officers captured at St Valery. It was the very first modern Scottish Country Dance published by the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society. The original tune written in Laufen has been superseded by the traditional reel &quot;The Drunken Piper&quot; and the dance was re-cast from its original form involving a longwise set of ten men to the more usual four couple set. The original ten-man version is still danced in some parts.

===In the media===
On 15 July 2018, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary called &#x27;Dunkirk: The Forgotten Heroes&#x27; In a review, in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the programme was given four stars out of five and called &quot;a terrific documentary that told the sad story of the men left behind&quot;.

<text>The Canadian Prairies (usually referred to as simply the Prairies in Canada) is a region in Western Canada. It includes the Canadian portion of the Great Plains and the Prairie provinces, namely Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. These provinces are partially covered by grasslands, plains, and lowlands, mostly in the southern regions. The northernmost reaches of the Canadian Prairies are less dense in population, marked by forests and more variable topography. If the region is defined to include areas only covered by prairie land, the corresponding region is known as the Interior Plains. Physical or ecological aspects of the Canadian Prairies extend to northeastern British Columbia, but that area is not included in political use of the term.

The prairies in Canada are a temperate grassland and shrubland biome within the prairie ecoregion of Canada that consists of northern mixed grasslands in Alberta, Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, as well as northern short grasslands in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan. The Prairies Ecozone of Canada includes the northern tall grasslands in southern Manitoba and Aspen parkland, which covers central Alberta, central Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba. The Prairie starts from north of Edmonton and it covers the three provinces in a southward-slanting line east to the Manitoba–Minnesota border. Alberta has the most land classified as prairie, while Manitoba has the least, as the boreal forest begins more southerly in Manitoba than in Alberta.

== Main climates ==
The core climate of the Canadian prairie region is defined as a semi-arid climate and is often based upon the Köppen climate classification system. This type of classification encompasses five main climate types, with several categoric subtypes based on the precipitation pattern of the region. The majority of the prairie provinces experience snowy, fully humid continental climates with cool summers, also known as class Dfc on the Köppen climate scale. The southernmost regions of the prairies tend to experience fully humid continental climates with warm summers, Dfb. A trifling section surrounding the Alberta-Saskatchewan border has been classified as Bsk, semi-cold and arid climate.

Precipitation events in the Canadian prairies are very important to study as these locations make up 80% of the country&#x27;s agricultural production. On average, 454 mm of precipitation falls on the prairies each year. Out of the three prairie provinces, Saskatchewan obtains the least amount of precipitation annually (395 mm), with Manitoba receiving the most at 486 mm. Most rainfall typically happens in the summer months such as June and July. With the high humidity of the prairies, tornadoes are likely to occur—marking central Saskatchewan, Alberta and southern Manitoba as high probability areas. Approximately 72% of tornadoes in Canada are seen across the prairies due to the capability of summer thunderstorm precipitation to mechanically mix with the air adjacent to the relatively flat surface of the region.

== Physical geography ==

Although the Prairie Provinces region is named for the prairies located within Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the physical geography of the three provinces is quite diverse, consisting of portions of the Canadian Shield, the Western Cordillera and the Canadian Interior Plains. The plains comprise both prairies and forests while, with the exception of freshwater along the Hudson Bay, the shield is predominantly forested.
=== Prairies ===
Three main grassland types occur in the Canadian prairies: tallgrass prairie, mixed grass prairie, and fescue prairie (or using the WWF terminology, northern tall grasslands, northern mixed grasslands, and northern short grasslands). Each has a unique geographic distribution and characteristic mix of plant species. All but a fraction of one per cent of the tallgrass prairie has been converted to cropland. What remains occurs on the plain centred in the Red River Valley in Manitoba. Mixed prairie is more common and is part of the dry interior plains that extend from Canada south to the U.S. state of Texas.


More than half of the remaining native grassland in the Canadian prairies is mixed. Though widespread in southern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, because of extensive cattle grazing, it is estimated that only 24% of the original mixed prairie grassland remains. Fescue prairie occurs in the moister regions, occupying the northern extent of the prairies in central and southwestern Alberta and west-central Saskatchewan.
The southwestern Canadian prairies, supporting brown and black soil types, are semi-arid and highly prone to frequent and severe droughts.
The zones around the cities of Regina and immediately east of Calgary are also very dry. Most heavy precipitation quickly dissipates by the time it passes Cheadle on its way heading east. In an average year, southern Saskatchewan receives between of precipitation, with the majority falling between April and June. Frost from October to April (and sometimes even early May) limits the growing season for certain crops.

The eastern section of the Canadian prairies in Manitoba is well watered with several large lakes such as Lake Winnipeg and several large rivers. The area also gets reasonable amounts of precipitation. The middle sections of Alberta and Saskatchewan are also wetter than the south and have better farmland, despite having a shorter frost-free season. The areas around Edmonton and Saskatoon are especially notable as good farmland. Both lie in the northern area of the Palliser&#x27;s Triangle, and are within aspen parkland a transitional prairie ecozone.

Further north, the area becomes too cold for most agriculture besides wild rice operations and sheep raising, and it is dominated by boreal forest. The Peace Region in northwestern Alberta is an exception, however. It lies north of the 55th Parallel and is warm and dry enough to support extensive farming. Aspen parkland covers the area; The long daylight hours in this region during the summer are an asset despite having an even shorter growing season than central Alberta. In fact, agriculture plays a major economic role in the Peace Region.
== Demographics ==
In the Canadian 2021 Census, the Canadian prairie provinces had a population of 6,737,293 consisting of 4,262,635 in Alberta, 1,342,153 in Manitoba, and 1,132,505 in Saskatchewan, up 4.6% from 6,443,892 in 2016. The three provinces have a combined area of , consisting of in Alberta, in Manitoba, and in Saskatchewan.

=== Growth ===
Some of the prairie region of Canada has seen rapid growth from a boom in oil production since the mid-20th century.
According to StatsCanada, the prairie provinces had a population of 6,443,892 in 2016. In 2021, the population had grown by 4.5% to 6,737,293.

== Economy ==

In the mid 20th century, the economy of the prairies exploded, due to the oil boom, and introduced a growth of jobs. The primary industries are agriculture and services. Agriculture consisting of livestock (cattle and sheep), cultivating crops (oats, canola, wheat, barley), and production of oil. Due to the production of oil, the service industry expanded in order to provide for the employees of the oil companies extracting the oil. In the 1950s-1970s, the explosion of oil production increased the worth of Alberta, allowing it to become the &quot;nation&#x27;s richest province&quot; and Canada one of the top petroleum exporters in the world. Edmonton and Calgary drew in a larger population with the increase in jobs in the energy industry, causing the jobs supporting this industry to grow as well. It was through the steady economic growth that followed this explosion that the prairies region began to switch from an agriculture-based job sector to one with services included.

In 2014, the global market for oil fell and led to a recession, impacting the economy dramatically. Alberta still has an oil-dominant economy even as the traditional oil wells dry up; there are oil sands further north (i.e. Fort McMurray) that continue to provide jobs to extract, drill and refine the oil. Saskatchewan, in particular, in the early 20th century grew economically due to the Canadian agricultural boom and produce large crops of wheat. It is said to have a &quot;one-crop economy&quot; due to such dependency on this crop alone, but after 1945 the economy took another turn with technological advancements that allowed for the discovery of uranium, oil, and potash.

== Culture and politics ==

The Prairies are distinguished from the rest of Canada by cultural and political traits. The oldest influence on Prairie culture are the First Nations, who have inhabited this region for millennia. This region has the highest proportion of Indigenous people in Canada, outside of the &quot;territories.&quot; The first Europeans to see the Prairies were fur traders and explorers from eastern Canada (mainly present-day Quebec) and Great Britain via Hudson Bay. They gave rise to the Métis, working class &quot;children of the fur trade.&quot; 

During their settlement by Europeans, the prairies were settled in distinct ethnic block settlements giving areas distinctively British, Ukrainian, German, French, or Scandinavian Canadian cultures. Farm family operations predominate, where families supplement their cash income with home-grown farm produce. Grain crops are the main cash crop, but mixed farming had natural advantages in the wooded areas of the parkland and boreal forest to the north. Local conditions attrracted particular ethnicities. Those of Ukrainians and Polish heritage were drawn to the parkland of east north-central Alberta.
Southern Alberta is renowned for its cowboy culture, which developed when real open range ranching was practiced in the 1880s. Canada&#x27;s first rodeo, the Raymond Stampede, was established in 1902. These influences are also evident in the music of Canada&#x27;s Prairie Provinces. This can be attributed partially to the massive influx of American settlers who began to migrate to Alberta (and to a lesser extent, Saskatchewan) in the late 1880s because of the lack of available land in the United States.

The Prairie Provinces have given rise to the &quot;prairie protest&quot; movements. Radical solutions are sometimes considered sound in the more open western culture. Organized Farmer groups and politicized labour groups were a feature of the inter-war years. The One Big Union was founded on the Prairies; the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 was the biggest general strike in Canadian history. The United Farmers of Alberta was the longest-lasting post-WWI Farmer government in Canada. Monetary reform (Social Credit) elected its first government in the world in Alberta in 1932. Preston Manning&#x27;s Reform Party, 1987 to 2000, had its strongest support among Prairie voters. 

These political movements (both of the left and right) tend to feed off of well established feelings of Western alienation, and each one represents a distinct challenge to the perceived Central Canadian elite.

The Prairies continue to have a wide range of political representation. While the Conservative Party of Canada has widespread support throughout the region at both federal and provincial levels, the New Democratic Party holds seats at the provincial level in all three provinces, and takes turns with Conservatives or another right-wing party at provincial government. The NDP holds seats at the federal level in Alberta and Manitoba. The Liberal Party of Canada often holds seats in Alberta and Manitoba; it presently holds four federal seats in Winnipeg, while the Manitoba Liberal Party holds one seat in Manitoba.

<text>The Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas is a Holiness Pentecostal Christian denomination based in the United States. Originating when the African American members of the integrated Fire-Baptized Holiness Church withdrew to form their own organization, the church was founded at Greer, South Carolina, in 1908. As such, though the Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas is multiracial, it is predominantly African-American.

==History==
The church was founded by Benjamin Hardin Irwin and Bishop William Edward Fuller Sr. (1875–1958). The Fire-Baptized Holiness Association originated in Iowa in 1895 under the leadership of Benjamin H. Irwin of Lincoln, Nebraska. Irwin expanded this into a national organization as the Fire-Baptized Holiness Church at Anderson, South Carolina, in August 1898. At age 23, William E. Fuller Sr., a member of the African-American New Hope Methodist Church, attended the founding of that body in 1898. Blacks and whites were admitted with equality. Fuller returned to New Hope from the 1898 meeting, resigned his offices, turned in his license, and cast his lot with the Fire-Baptized Holiness. After Irwin left the church in 1900, Joseph Hillery King became the general overseer. Fuller served as Assistant General Overseer to King in 1905.

Acting on what he thought was a trend toward segregation, Fuller led about 500 members to organize the Colored Fire Baptized Holiness Church in 1908 in Greer, South Carolina. &quot;The True Witness&quot; periodical was established in 1909. On June 8, 1926, the name Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas was adopted.

The predominantly Anglo-American division of the Fire-Baptized Holiness Church merged with the Pentecostal Holiness Church on January 30, 1911, in Falcon, North Carolina, to form what is now known as the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, though prior to this in 1898, the Southeastern Kansas Fire Baptized Holiness Association separated from the denomination over differences in doctrine and is known today as the Bible Holiness Church.

==Structure and beliefs==
The church government of the organization is episcopal. Bishops are the highest officials of the church, and preside over divisions called &quot;dioceses&quot;. The sacraments of the church are baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Feet washing, matrimony, and funerals are considered ordinances. Women can be licensed and ordained to preach and serve as pastors.

The church headquarters and school are located in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2003, the Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God had about 160 congregations, mostly on the east coast of the United States, but also including one church each in Canada, England, the Virgin Islands, and 15 congregations in Jamaica. In 2010, there were 216 churches in the United States.

<text>The Hattians () were an ancient Bronze Age people that inhabited the land of &quot;Hatti&quot;, in central Anatolia (modern Turkey). They spoke a distinctive Hattian language, which was neither Semitic nor Indo-European. Hattians are attested by archeological records from the Early Bronze Age and by historical references in later Hittite and other sources. Their main centre was the city of Hattush. Faced with Hittite expansion (since 2000 BC), Hattians were gradually absorbed (by 1700 BC) into the new political and social order, imposed by the Hittites, who were one of the Indo-European-speaking Anatolian peoples. The Hittites kept the country name (&quot;land of Hatti&quot;) unchanged, which also became the main designation for the Hittite state.

==Terminology==
Complex questions related to etymology of native names for Hattians, their land, language and capital city (Hatti, Hattili, Hattush) are debated among scholars. Later conquerors (Hittites) did not change the name of the city (Hattush). They also adopted the regional name (Land of Hatti), and even expanded its use, transforming it into the most common designation for their entire country, that grew to be much larger than the land of ancient Hattians. 

It is therefore assumed that &quot;Hattian&quot; designations had some special significance already during the pre-Hittite period, and it is also accepted, as a convention among scholars, that &quot;Hattian&quot; labels can be used as designations for the pre-Hittite population of central Anatolia, although it is not known whether ethnically related inhabitants of neighboring regions and city-states (surrounding the city-state of Hattush) ever saw themselves as &quot;Hattians&quot;.

The use of the term &quot;Proto-Hittite&quot; as a designation for Hattians is inaccurate. The Hittite language (self-designation: &quot;Nešili&quot;, &quot;[in the language] of Neša&quot;) is an Indo-European language and thus linguistically distinct from the (non-Indo-European) Hattian language. The Hittites continued to use the term “Land of Hatti” for their own state. The Hattians eventually merged with people who spoke Indo-European languages of the Anatolian group, including Hittite, Luwian, and Palaic.

==History==
Several archeological sites in central Anatolia, dating from the Early Bronze Age (second half of the 3rd millennium BC) are attributed to ancient Hattians. The structure of archeological finds in some sites, like Hattush, reveal the existence of a complex culture with distinct social stratification. Most scholars believe that the first Hattian states existed already during the period of the Akkadian Empire. That assumption is based on some later sources, mainly Hittite and Assyrian. The epic known as the &quot;King of Battle&quot; (recorded in several versions from the 14th century BC onward) narrates about a war between Sargon the Great of Akkad (24th-23rd century BC) and king Nur-Daggal of Purushanda, but those events are not attested in contemporary sources, that would date from the period of the Akkadian Empire.

A Hittite version from 1400 BC of an older Akkadian story also narrates some events that are related to early times, taking place during the rule of king Naram-Sin of Akad (23rd century BC). The story describes a conflict between Naram-Sin and an alliance of 17 kings. The Hittite version of that story includes Pamba of Hatti among those kings, but that inclusion is not attested in Akkadian versions of the story, nor in contemporary sources, that would date from the period of the Akkadian Empire. Some scholars hold that the Hittite version (from 1400 BC) can be accepted as reliable and derived from some local sources. In that case, the narrative would contain a trustworthy tradition, thus providing a base for an assumption that the ancient Kingdom of Hatti existed already during the period of the Akkadian Empire. 

The Hattians were organized in monarchical city-states. These states were ruled as theocratic kingdoms or principalities. Hattian regions of Anatolia came to be influenced by mighty Mesopotamian polities, such as those of the Akkadian Empire (24th-22nd century BC) and the succeeding Old Assyrian Empire (21st-18th century BC), both of which set up trading colonies called &quot;karum&quot;, located throughout eastern and central Anatolia. During the first centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, an Assyrian trade colony existed in the city of Hattush, and several Assyrian inscriptions mention (usually by office, not by name) the existence of local rulers (kings) of Hattush, also referring to their relations with other city-states in the region.

==Language==

Hattians spoke the Hattian language, a non-Indo-European and non-Semitic language of uncertain affiliation. Hattian is now believed by some scholars to be related to the Northwest Caucasian language group. Trevor Bryce writes:
About 150 short specimens of Hattian text have been found in Hittite cuneiform clay tablets. Hattian leaders perhaps used scribes who wrote in Old Assyrian. Ekrem Akurgal wrote, &quot;the Anatolian princes used scribes knowing Assyrian for commerce with Mesopotomia as at Kanesh (Kültepe)&quot; to conduct business with Assyria. From the 21st to the mid-18th centuries BC, Assyria established trade outposts in Hatti, such as at Hattum and Zalpa.

Scholars have long assumed that the predominant population of the region of Anatolia &quot;in the third millennium [BC] was an indigenous pre-Indo-European group called the Hattians.&quot; Another non-Indo-European group were the Hurrians. But it is thought possible that speakers of Indo-European languages were also in central Anatolia by then. The scholar Petra Goedegebuure has proposed that before the conquest of the Hittites, an Indo-European language, probably Luwian, had already been spoken alongside the Hattian language for a long time.

Hattian became more ergative towards the New Hittite period. This development implies that Hattian remained alive until at least the end of the 14th century BC.

Alexei Kassian proposed that the Northwest Caucasian languages (also known as Abkhazo-Adyghe), which are syntactically subject–object–verb, had lexical contacts with Hattian.

==Religion==
Hattian religion may be traced back to the Stone Age. It involved worship of the earth, personified as a mother goddess, whom the Hattians honored in order to ensure bountiful harvests and their own well-being. The Hattian pantheon of gods included the storm-god &quot;Taru&quot; (represented by a bull), the sun-goddess &quot;Furušemu&quot; or &quot;Wurunšemu&quot; (represented by a leopard), and a number of other elemental gods. 

Later on the Hittites subsumed much of the Hattian pantheon into their own religious beliefs. James Mellaart has proposed that the indigenous Anatolian religion revolved around a water-from-the-earth concept. Pictorial and written sources show that the deity of paramount importance to the inhabitants of Anatolia was the terrestrial water-god. Many gods are connected with the earth and water. In Hittite cuneiform, the terrestrial water god is generally represented with dIM. The storm gods of Anatolia were written with about one hundred catalogue variants of dU, mostly described as the Stormgod of Hatti or with a city name.

The Hittite legends of Telipinu and the serpentine dragon Illuyanka find their origin in the Hattian civilization.

<text>Cleto de Jesús González Víquez (13 October 1858 – 23 September 1937) was, on two occasions, the President of Costa Rica, firstly as the 18th president in 1906 and lastly as the 26th president in 1928. González Víquez was born in Barva, Heredia, on October 13, 1858, as the son of Cleto González Pérez and Aurora Víquez Murillo. He was a renowned Costa Rican politician, lawyer, and historian.

<doc id="437273" wikidata="Q264210" url="?curid=437273" title="Mu'awiya II">
<text>Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya (; –684), commonly known as Mu&#x27;awiya II, was the third Umayyad caliph, ruling for less than a year in 683–684.

He succeeded his father Yazid I as the third caliph and last caliph of the Sufyanid line in the Umayyad dynasty. He ruled briefly in 683–684 (64 AH) before he died.

==Early life==
Mu&#x27;awiya was born in Syria as the son of Yazid I and an unknown mother from the Kalb tribe. She is often confused with Umm Hashim Fakhitah bint Abi Hisham, mother of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s half-brother Khalid ibn Yazid.

His father, Yazid died on 11 November 683 in the central Syrian desert town of Huwwarin, his favourite residence, aged between 35 and 43, and was buried there.

==Reign==
Before Yazid I died, he had the &quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot; made to his son Mu&#x27;awiya. Mu&#x27;awiya succeeded his father in Damascus in 64 AH (November 683 CE), at an age of somewhere between 17 and 23. He was supported by the Kalb tribe, but his authority was likely only recognised in Damascus and southern Syria, with Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr claiming the caliphate from his base in the Hejaz.

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign would have lasted for about 20 days to 4 months, but likely no more than 2 months. Given the short span of time, few events were possible, and some of those transmitted may be unreliable political and sectarian fabrications. These include:
*Being a member of the Qadariyya, resulting from the belief that Mu&#x27;awiya abdicated before his death.
*Denouncing his predecessors&#x27; tyranny and injustice towards the Alids.
*Having the kunya &quot;Abu Layla&quot; (&quot;Father of Layla&quot;), a name often applied to weak persons. This was suspicious because he had no children.
*Abdication before his death, originating from later Marwanid propaganda.

What does seem certain, is that Mu&#x27;awiya continued his father&#x27;s policy and remitted a third of the taxes. During his reign, Mu&#x27;awiya suffered from ill health and so had to stay in the Umayyad palace (&quot;&quot;) in Damascus. His adviser Al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri took care of practical affairs. After 40 days however, Mu&#x27;awiya abdicated from the throne. He said to his family members:&#x27;My father was cruel. He massacred the family of the Prophet for the throne. Therefore I curse this throne... give it to whoever you want.&#x27; 

==Death and legacy==

It is unclear how Mu&#x27;awiya died, although jaundice and a plague have been named as causes. Since he had no children and either refused or was not given the opportunity to appoint a successor, the campaigns against Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s revolt came to a complete stop. Umayyad power temporarily collapsed until Marwan I took back control.

In his &quot;al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot;, Ibn Arabi claimed that Muawiyya II was a spiritual Pole (&quot;Ghawth&quot;) of his time and one of the few in history having such a spiritual degree combined with a temporal power, like Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali. his grandfather Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan and Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz.

<text>In statistics, an effect size is a value measuring the strength of the relationship between two variables in a population, or a sample-based estimate of that quantity. It can refer to the value of a statistic calculated from a sample of data, the value of one parameter for a hypothetical population, or to the equation that operationalizes how statistics or parameters lead to the effect size value. Examples of effect sizes include the correlation between two variables, the regression coefficient in a regression, the mean difference, or the risk of a particular event (such as a heart attack) happening. Effect sizes are a complement tool for statistical hypothesis testing, and play an important role in power analyses to assess the sample size required for new experiments. Effect size are fundamental in meta-analyses which aim to provide the combined effect size based on data from multiple studies. The cluster of data-analysis methods concerning effect sizes is referred to as estimation statistics.

Effect size is an essential component when evaluating the strength of a statistical claim, and it is the first item (magnitude) in the MAGIC criteria. The standard deviation of the effect size is of critical importance, since it indicates how much uncertainty is included in the measurement. A standard deviation that is too large will make the measurement nearly meaningless. In meta-analysis, where the purpose is to combine multiple effect sizes, the uncertainty in the effect size is used to weigh effect sizes, so that large studies are considered more important than small studies. The uncertainty in the effect size is calculated differently for each type of effect size, but generally only requires knowing the study&#x27;s sample size (&quot;N&quot;), or the number of observations (&quot;n&quot;) in each group.

Reporting effect sizes or estimates thereof (effect estimate [EE], estimate of effect) is considered good practice when presenting empirical research findings in many fields. The reporting of effect sizes facilitates the interpretation of the importance of a research result, in contrast to its statistical significance. Effect sizes are particularly prominent in social science and in medical research (where size of treatment effect is important).

Effect sizes may be measured in relative or absolute terms. In relative effect sizes, two groups are directly compared with each other, as in odds ratios and relative risks. For absolute effect sizes, a larger absolute value always indicates a stronger effect. Many types of measurements can be expressed as either absolute or relative, and these can be used together because they convey different information. A prominent task force in the psychology research community made the following recommendation:

==Overview==

===Population and sample effect sizes===
As in statistical estimation, the true effect size is distinguished from the observed effect size. For example, to measure the risk of disease in a population (the population effect size) one can measure the risk within a sample of that population (the sample effect size). Conventions for describing true and observed effect sizes follow standard statistical practices—one common approach is to use Greek letters like ρ [rho] to denote population parameters and Latin letters like &quot;r&quot; to denote the corresponding statistic. Alternatively, a &quot;hat&quot; can be placed over the population parameter to denote the statistic, e.g. with formula_1 being the estimate of the parameter formula_2.

As in any statistical setting, effect sizes are estimated with sampling error, and may be biased unless the effect size estimator that is used is appropriate for the manner in which the data were sampled and the manner in which the measurements were made. An example of this is publication bias, which occurs when scientists report results only when the estimated effect sizes are large or are statistically significant. As a result, if many researchers carry out studies with low statistical power, the reported effect sizes will tend to be larger than the true (population) effects, if any. Another example where effect sizes may be distorted is in a multiple-trial experiment, where the effect size calculation is based on the averaged or aggregated response across the trials.

Smaller studies sometimes show different, often larger, effect sizes than larger studies. This phenomenon is known as the small-study effect, which may signal publication bias.

===Relationship to test statistics===
Sample-based effect sizes are distinguished from test statistics used in hypothesis testing, in that they estimate the strength (magnitude) of, for example, an apparent relationship, rather than assigning a significance level reflecting whether the magnitude of the relationship observed could be due to chance. The effect size does not directly determine the significance level, or vice versa. Given a sufficiently large sample size, a non-null statistical comparison will always show a statistically significant result unless the population effect size is exactly zero (and even there it will show statistical significance at the rate of the Type I error used). For example, a sample Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.01 is statistically significant if the sample size is 1000. Reporting only the significant &quot;p&quot;-value from this analysis could be misleading if a correlation of 0.01 is too small to be of interest in a particular application.

===Standardized and unstandardized effect sizes===
The term &quot;effect size&quot; can refer to a standardized measure of effect (such as &quot;r&quot;, Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot;, or the odds ratio), or to an unstandardized measure (e.g., the difference between group means or the unstandardized regression coefficients). Standardized effect size measures are typically used when:
* the metrics of variables being studied do not have intrinsic meaning (e.g., a score on a personality test on an arbitrary scale),
* results from multiple studies are being combined,
* some or all of the studies use different scales, or
* it is desired to convey the size of an effect relative to the variability in the population.
In meta-analyses, standardized effect sizes are used as a common measure that can be calculated for different studies and then combined into an overall summary.

==Interpretation==

The interpretation of an effect size of being &quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, or &quot;large&quot; depends on its substantive context and its operational definition. Cohen suggested interpretation guidelines that are near ubiquitous across many fields. However, Cohen also cautioned:

&quot;The terms &#x27;small,&#x27; &#x27;medium,&#x27; and &#x27;large&#x27; are relative, not only to each other, but to the area of behavioral science or even more particularly to the specific content and research method being employed in any given investigation... In the face of this relativity, there is a certain risk inherent in offering conventional operational definitions for these terms for use in power analysis in as diverse a field of inquiry as behavioral science. This risk is nevertheless accepted in the belief that more is to be gained than lost by supplying a common conventional frame of reference which is recommended for use only when no better basis for estimating the ES index is available.&quot; (p. 25)

Sawilowsky recommended that the rules of thumb for effect sizes should be revised, and expanded the descriptions to include &quot;very small&quot;, &quot;very large&quot;, and &quot;huge&quot;. Funder and Ozer suggested that effect sizes should be interpreted based on benchmarks and consequences of findings, resulting in adjustment of guideline recommendations.

Length noted for a &quot;medium&quot; effect size, &quot;you&#x27;ll choose the same &quot;n&quot; regardless of the accuracy or reliability of your instrument, or the narrowness or diversity of your subjects. Clearly, important considerations are being ignored here. Researchers should interpret the substantive significance of their results by grounding them in a meaningful context or by quantifying their contribution to knowledge, and Cohen&#x27;s effect size descriptions can be helpful as a starting point.&quot; Similarly, a U.S. Dept of Education sponsored report argued that the widespread indiscriminate use of Cohen&#x27;s interpretation guidelines can be inappropriate and misleading. They instead suggested that norms should be based on distributions of effect sizes from comparable studies. Thus a small effect (in absolute numbers) could be considered &quot;large&quot; if the effect is larger than similar studies in the field. See Abelson&#x27;s paradox and Sawilowsky&#x27;s paradox for related points.

The table below contains descriptors for various magnitudes of &quot;d&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;omega&quot;, as initially suggested by Cohen, and later expanded by Sawilowsky, and by Funder &amp; Ozer.

==Types==
About 50 to 100 different measures of effect size are known. Many effect sizes of different types can be converted to other types, as many estimate the separation of two distributions, so are mathematically related. For example, a correlation coefficient can be converted to a Cohen&#x27;s d and vice versa.

=== Correlation family: Effect sizes based on &quot;variance explained&quot; ===
These effect sizes estimate the amount of the variance within an experiment that is &quot;explained&quot; or &quot;accounted for&quot; by the experiment&#x27;s model (Explained variation).

==== Pearson &quot;r&quot; or correlation coefficient ====
Pearson&#x27;s correlation, often denoted &quot;r&quot; and introduced by Karl Pearson, is widely used as an &quot;effect size&quot; when paired quantitative data are available; for instance if one were studying the relationship between birth weight and longevity. The correlation coefficient can also be used when the data are binary. Pearson&#x27;s &quot;r&quot; can vary in magnitude from −1 to 1, with −1 indicating a perfect negative linear relation, 1 indicating a perfect positive linear relation, and 0 indicating no linear relation between two variables.

===== Coefficient of determination (&quot;r&quot;2 or &quot;R&quot;2) =====
A related &quot;effect size&quot; is &quot;r&quot;2, the coefficient of determination (also referred to as &quot;R&quot;2 or &quot;&quot;r&quot;-squared&quot;), calculated as the square of the Pearson correlation &quot;r&quot;. In the case of paired data, this is a measure of the proportion of variance shared by the two variables, and varies from 0 to 1. For example, with an &quot;r&quot; of 0.21 the coefficient of determination is 0.0441, meaning that 4.4% of the variance of either variable is shared with the other variable. The &quot;r&quot;2 is always positive, so does not convey the direction of the correlation between the two variables.

===== Eta-squared (&quot;η&quot;2) =====
Eta-squared describes the ratio of variance explained in the dependent variable by a predictor while controlling for other predictors, making it analogous to the &quot;r&quot;2. Eta-squared is a biased estimator of the variance explained by the model in the population (it estimates only the effect size in the sample). This estimate shares the weakness with &quot;r&quot;2 that each additional variable will automatically increase the value of &quot;η&quot;2. In addition, it measures the variance explained of the sample, not the population, meaning that it will always overestimate the effect size, although the bias grows smaller as the sample grows larger.
formula_3

===== Omega-squared (&quot;ω&quot;2) =====

A less biased estimator of the variance explained in the population is &quot;ω&quot;2
formula_4

This form of the formula is limited to between-subjects analysis with equal sample sizes in all cells. Since it is less biased (although not &quot;un&quot;biased), &quot;ω&quot;2 is preferable to η2; however, it can be more inconvenient to calculate for complex analyses. A generalized form of the estimator has been published for between-subjects and within-subjects analysis, repeated measure, mixed design, and randomized block design experiments. In addition, methods to calculate partial &quot;ω&quot;2 for individual factors and combined factors in designs with up to three independent variables have been published.

==== Cohen&#x27;s &quot;f&quot;2 ====
Cohen&#x27;s &quot;f&quot;2 is one of several effect size measures to use in the context of an F-test for ANOVA or multiple regression. Its amount of bias (overestimation of the effect size for the ANOVA) depends on the bias of its underlying measurement of variance explained (e.g., &quot;R&quot;2, &quot;η&quot;2, &quot;ω&quot;2).

The &quot;f&quot;2 effect size measure for multiple regression is defined as:
formula_5
where &quot;R&quot;2 is the squared multiple correlation.

Likewise, &quot;f&quot;2 can be defined as:
formula_6 or formula_7
for models described by those effect size measures.

The formula_8 effect size measure for sequential multiple regression and also common for PLS modeling is defined as:
formula_9
where &quot;R&quot;2&quot;A&quot; is the variance accounted for by a set of one or more independent variables &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;R&quot;2&quot;AB&quot; is the combined variance accounted for by &quot;A&quot; and another set of one or more independent variables of interest &quot;B&quot;. By convention, &quot;f&quot;2 effect sizes of formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12 are termed &quot;small&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;large&quot;, respectively.

Cohen&#x27;s formula_13 can also be found for factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) working backwards, using:
formula_14

In a balanced design (equivalent sample sizes across groups) of ANOVA, the corresponding population parameter of formula_15 is
formula_16
wherein &quot;μ&quot;&quot;j&quot; denotes the population mean within the &quot;j&quot;th group of the total &quot;K&quot; groups, and &quot;σ&quot; the equivalent population standard deviations within each groups. &quot;SS&quot; is the sum of squares in ANOVA.

==== Cohen&#x27;s &quot;q&quot; ====

Another measure that is used with correlation differences is Cohen&#x27;s q. This is the difference between two Fisher transformed Pearson regression coefficients. In symbols this is
formula_17

where &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 are the regressions being compared. The expected value of &quot;q&quot; is zero and its variance is
formula_18
where &quot;N&quot;1 and &quot;N&quot;2 are the number of data points in the first and second regression respectively.

=== Difference family: Effect sizes based on differences between means ===
The raw effect size pertaining to a comparison of two groups is inherently calculated as the differences between the two means. However, to facilitate interpretation it is common to standardise the effect size; various conventions for statistical standardisation are presented below.

==== Standardized mean difference ====
A (population) effect size &quot;θ&quot; based on means usually considers the standardized mean difference (SMD) between two populations
formula_19
where &quot;μ&quot;1 is the mean for one population, &quot;μ&quot;2 is the mean for the other population, and σ is a standard deviation based on either or both populations.

In the practical setting the population values are typically not known and must be estimated from sample statistics. The several versions of effect sizes based on means differ with respect to which statistics are used.

This form for the effect size resembles the computation for a &quot;t&quot;-test statistic, with the critical difference that the &quot;t&quot;-test statistic includes a factor of formula_20. This means that for a given effect size, the significance level increases with the sample size. Unlike the &quot;t&quot;-test statistic, the effect size aims to estimate a population parameter and is not affected by the sample size.

SMD values of 0.2 to 0.5 are considered small, 0.5 to 0.8 are considered medium, and greater than 0.8 are considered large.

====Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; ====
Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; is defined as the difference between two means divided by a standard deviation for the data, i.e.
formula_21

Jacob Cohen defined &quot;s&quot;, the pooled standard deviation, as (for two independent samples):
formula_22
where the variance for one of the groups is defined as
formula_23
and similarly for the other group.

Other authors choose a slightly different computation of the standard deviation when referring to &quot;Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot;&quot; where the denominator is without &quot;-2&quot;
formula_24
This definition of &quot;Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot;&quot; is termed the maximum likelihood estimator by Hedges and Olkin,
and it is related to Hedges&#x27; &quot;g&quot; by a scaling factor (see below).

With two paired samples, we look at the distribution of the difference scores. In that case, &quot;s&quot; is the standard deviation of this distribution of difference scores. This creates the following relationship between the t-statistic to test for a difference in the means of the two groups and Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot;:
formula_25
and
formula_26

Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; is frequently used in estimating sample sizes for statistical testing. A lower Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; indicates the necessity of larger sample sizes, and vice versa, as can subsequently be determined together with the additional parameters of desired significance level and statistical power.

For paired samples Cohen suggests that the d calculated is actually a d&#x27;, which does not provide the correct answer to obtain the power of the test, and that before looking the values up in the tables provided, it should be corrected for r as in the following formula:
formula_27

==== Glass&#x27; Δ ====
In 1976, Gene V. Glass proposed an estimator of the effect size that uses only the standard deviation of the second group
formula_28

The second group may be regarded as a control group, and Glass argued that if several treatments were compared to the control group it would be better to use just the standard deviation computed from the control group, so that effect sizes would not differ under equal means and different variances.

Under a correct assumption of equal population variances a pooled estimate for &quot;σ&quot; is more precise.

==== Hedges&#x27; &quot;g&quot; ====
Hedges&#x27; &quot;g&quot;, suggested by Larry Hedges in 1981,
is like the other measures based on a standardized difference
formula_29
where the pooled standard deviation formula_30 is computed as:
formula_31

However, as an estimator for the population effect size &quot;θ&quot; it is biased.
Nevertheless, this bias can be approximately corrected through multiplication by a factor
formula_32
Hedges and Olkin refer to this less-biased estimator formula_33 as &quot;d&quot;, but it is not the same as Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot;.
The exact form for the correction factor &quot;J&quot;() involves the gamma function
formula_34

There are also multilevel variants of Hedges&#x27; g, e.g., for use in cluster randomised controlled trials (CRTs). CRTs involve randomising clusters, such as schools or classrooms, to different conditions and are frequently used in education research.

====Ψ, root-mean-square standardized effect====
A similar effect size estimator for multiple comparisons (e.g., ANOVA) is the Ψ root-mean-square standardized effect:
formula_35
where &quot;k&quot; is the number of groups in the comparisons.

This essentially presents the omnibus difference of the entire model adjusted by the root mean square, analogous to &quot;d&quot; or &quot;g&quot;.

In addition, a generalization for multi-factorial designs has been provided.

==== Distribution of effect sizes based on means ====
Provided that the data is Gaussian distributed a scaled Hedges&#x27; &quot;g&quot;, formula_36, follows a noncentral &quot;t&quot;-distribution with the noncentrality parameter formula_37 and degrees of freedom. Likewise, the scaled Glass&#x27; Δ is distributed with degrees of freedom.

From the distribution it is possible to compute the expectation and variance of the effect sizes.

In some cases large sample approximations for the variance are used. One suggestion for the variance of Hedges&#x27; unbiased estimator is 
formula_38

==== Strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) ====
As a statistical parameter, SSMD (denoted as formula_39) is defined as the ratio of mean to standard deviation of the difference of two random values respectively from two groups. Assume that one group with random values has mean formula_40 and variance formula_41 and another group has mean formula_42 and variance formula_43. The covariance between the two groups is formula_44 Then, the SSMD for the comparison of these two groups is defined as
:formula_45

If the two groups are independent,
:formula_46
If the two independent groups have equal variances formula_47,
:formula_48

==== Other metrics ====
Mahalanobis distance (D) is a multivariate generalization of Cohen&#x27;s d, which takes into account the relationships between the variables.

===Categorical family: Effect sizes for associations among categorical variables===
Commonly used measures of association for the chi-squared test are the Phi coefficient and Cramér&#x27;s V (sometimes referred to as Cramér&#x27;s phi and denoted as &quot;φ&quot;&quot;c&quot;). Phi is related to the point-biserial correlation coefficient and Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; and estimates the extent of the relationship between two variables (2 × 2). Cramér&#x27;s V may be used with variables having more than two levels.

Phi can be computed by finding the square root of the chi-squared statistic divided by the sample size.

Similarly, Cramér&#x27;s V is computed by taking the square root of the chi-squared statistic divided by the sample size and the length of the minimum dimension (&quot;k&quot; is the smaller of the number of rows &quot;r&quot; or columns &quot;c&quot;).

φ&quot;c&quot; is the intercorrelation of the two discrete variables and may be computed for any value of &quot;r&quot; or &quot;c&quot;. However, as chi-squared values tend to increase with the number of cells, the greater the difference between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, the more likely V will tend to 1 without strong evidence of a meaningful correlation.

==== Cohen&#x27;s omega (&quot;ω&quot;) ====

Another measure of effect size used for chi-squared tests is Cohen&#x27;s omega (formula_49). This is defined as
formula_50
where &quot;p&quot;0&quot;i&quot; is the proportion of the &quot;i&quot;th cell under &quot;H&quot;0, &quot;p&quot;1&quot;i&quot; is the proportion of the &quot;i&quot;th cell under &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot; is the number of cells.

==== Odds ratio ====

The odds ratio (OR) is another useful effect size. It is appropriate when the research question focuses on the degree of association between two binary variables. For example, consider a study of spelling ability. In a control group, two students pass the class for every one who fails, so the odds of passing are two to one (or 2/1 = 2). In the treatment group, six students pass for every one who fails, so the odds of passing are six to one (or 6/1 = 6). The effect size can be computed by noting that the odds of passing in the treatment group are three times higher than in the control group (because 6 divided by 2 is 3). Therefore, the odds ratio is 3. Odds ratio statistics are on a different scale than Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot;, so this &#x27;3&#x27; is not comparable to a Cohen&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; of 3.

==== Relative risk ====

The relative risk (RR), also called risk ratio, is simply the risk (probability) of an event relative to some independent variable. This measure of effect size differs from the odds ratio in that it compares &quot;probabilities&quot; instead of &quot;odds&quot;, but asymptotically approaches the latter for small probabilities. Using the example above, the &quot;probabilities&quot; for those in the control group and treatment group passing is 2/3 (or 0.67) and 6/7 (or 0.86), respectively. The effect size can be computed the same as above, but using the probabilities instead. Therefore, the relative risk is 1.28. Since rather large probabilities of passing were used, there is a large difference between relative risk and odds ratio. Had &quot;failure&quot; (a smaller probability) been used as the event (rather than &quot;passing&quot;), the difference between the two measures of effect size would not be so great.

While both measures are useful, they have different statistical uses. In medical research, the odds ratio is commonly used for case-control studies, as odds, but not probabilities, are usually estimated. Relative risk is commonly used in randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, but relative risk contributes to overestimations of the effectiveness of interventions.

==== Risk difference ====
The risk difference (RD), sometimes called absolute risk reduction, is simply the difference in risk (probability) of an event between two groups. It is a useful measure in experimental research, since RD tells you the extent to which an experimental interventions changes the probability of an event or outcome. Using the example above, the probabilities for those in the control group and treatment group passing is 2/3 (or 0.67) and 6/7 (or 0.86), respectively, and so the RD effect size is 0.86 − 0.67 = 0.19 (or 19%). RD is the superior measure for assessing effectiveness of interventions.

==== Cohen&#x27;s &quot;h&quot; ====
One measure used in power analysis when comparing two independent proportions is Cohen&#x27;s &quot;h&quot;. This is defined as follows
formula_51
where &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 are the proportions of the two samples being compared and arcsin is the arcsine transformation.

==== Probability of superiority ====

To more easily describe the meaning of an effect size to people outside statistics, the common language effect size, as the name implies, was designed to communicate it in plain English. It is used to describe a difference between two groups and was proposed, as well as named, by Kenneth McGraw and S. P. Wong in 1992. They used the following example (about heights of men and women): &quot;in any random pairing of young adult males and females, the probability of the male being taller than the female is .92, or in simpler terms yet, in 92 out of 100 blind dates among young adults, the male will be taller than the female&quot;, when describing the population value of the common language effect size.

==== Effect size for ordinal data ====
Cliff&#x27;s delta or formula_52, originally developed by Norman Cliff for use with ordinal data, is a measure of how often the values in one distribution are larger than the values in a second distribution. Crucially, it does not require any assumptions about the shape or spread of the two distributions.

The sample estimate formula_52 is given by:
formula_54
where the two distributions are of size formula_55 and formula_56 with items formula_57 and formula_58, respectively, and formula_59 is the Iverson bracket, which is 1 when the contents are true and 0 when false.

formula_52 is linearly related to the Mann–Whitney U statistic; however, it captures the direction of the difference in its sign. Given the Mann–Whitney formula_61, formula_52 is:
formula_63

==== Cohen&#x27;s g ====
One of simplest effect sizes for measuring how much a proportion differs from 50% is Cohen&#x27;s g. It measures how much a proportion differs from 50%. For example, if 85.2% of arrests for car theft are males, then effect size of sex on arrest when measured with Cohen&#x27;s g is formula_64. In general:

formula_65

formula_66

Units of Cohen&#x27;s g are more intuitive (proportion) than in some other effect sizes. It is sometime used in combination with Binomial test.

== Confidence intervals by means of noncentrality parameters ==

Confidence intervals of standardized effect sizes, especially Cohen&#x27;s formula_67 and formula_15, rely on the calculation of confidence intervals of noncentrality parameters (&quot;ncp&quot;). A common approach to construct the confidence interval of &quot;ncp&quot; is to find the critical &quot;ncp&quot; values to fit the observed statistic to tail quantiles &quot;α&quot;/2 and (1 − &quot;α&quot;/2). The SAS and R-package MBESS provides functions to find critical values of &quot;ncp&quot;.

=== &quot;t&quot;-test for mean difference of single group or two related groups ===
For a single group, &quot;M&quot; denotes the sample mean, &quot;μ&quot; the population mean, &quot;SD&quot; the sample&#x27;s standard deviation, &quot;σ&quot; the population&#x27;s standard deviation, and &quot;n&quot; is the sample size of the group. The &quot;t&quot; value is used to test the hypothesis on the difference between the mean and a baseline &quot;μ&quot;baseline. Usually, &quot;μ&quot;baseline is zero. In the case of two related groups, the single group is constructed by the differences in pair of samples, while &quot;SD&quot; and &quot;σ&quot; denote the sample&#x27;s and population&#x27;s standard deviations of differences rather than within original two groups.
formula_69
formula_70
and Cohen&#x27;s
formula_71

is the point estimate of
formula_72

So,
:formula_73

=== &quot;t&quot;-test for mean difference between two independent groups ===
&quot;n&quot;1 or &quot;n&quot;2 are the respective sample sizes.
formula_74

wherein
formula_75
formula_76

and Cohen&#x27;s
formula_77 is the point estimate of formula_78

So,
formula_79

=== One-way ANOVA test for mean difference across multiple independent groups ===
One-way ANOVA test applies noncentral F distribution. While with a given population standard deviation formula_80, the same test question applies noncentral chi-squared distribution.
formula_81

For each &quot;j&quot;-th sample within &quot;i&quot;-th group &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;, denote
formula_82

While,
formula_83

So, both &quot;ncp&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) of &quot;F&quot; and formula_84 equate
formula_85

In case of formula_86 for &quot;K&quot; independent groups of same size, the total sample size is &quot;N&quot; := &quot;n&quot;·&quot;K&quot;.
formula_87

The &quot;t&quot;-test for a pair of independent groups is a special case of one-way ANOVA. Note that the noncentrality parameter formula_88 of &quot;F&quot; is not comparable to the noncentrality parameter formula_89 of the corresponding &quot;t&quot;. Actually, formula_90, and formula_91.

<text>Alfredo González Flores (15 June 1877 - 28 December 1962), served as President of Costa Rica from 1914 to 1917. He was unable to complete his presidential mandate following a coup d&#x27;état on 27 January 1917, led by Federico Tinoco, his secretary for War and the Navy.

==Early life==
González was born in Heredia, Costa Rica on 15 June 1877 as the son of Domingo González Pérez and Elemberta Flores Zamora. He graduated from the in 1896 and obtained his law degree in 1903.

==Political years==
He was called to the Presidency on 8 May 1914 by the Congress, as part of a pact between the two major political parties, the Republican Party and the Duranista party, after none of the three competing parties managed to secure an absolute majority. Political scientist James L. Busey called him a &quot;compromise dark horse candidate&quot;.

During his administration, he founded the Normal School of Heredia (1915, of which he also was President of the Board), the National Electricity Cabinet and the International Bank of Costa Rica (now the National Bank of Costa Rica). He also created the Agricultural Credit Meetings, which led to a resurgence of economic, commercial and industrial activity in the country. He established the &quot;General Depots&quot;, the system of direct taxation and the Charity Tax Law. He governed during World War I, a time when he endured serious financial consequences.
At a time when banks refused to facilitate credit for the Executive Branch, he created the International Bank, which had the ability to issue currency. From that moment, the State competed with private institutions. Busey summarized his presidential term as &quot;Attempted to promote fiscal stability; but much nepotism and electoral fraud&quot;.

On 27 January 1917, his own Secretary of the Army and Navy, Federico Tinoco, overthrew him. González followed the advice of his other ministers and left the country for the United States. He later worked for the recognition of the country&#x27;s rights in different international forums. After returning to the country, he played an important role in the politics of Heredia.

He was considered an authority in financial matters and a precursor of modern democracy. He was declared a national hero () on 23 July 1954. He died in Heredia on 28 December 1962.

==Legacy==
González was a precursor of modern democracy in Costa Rica. He was declared a national hero and is known for his wise financial decisions in government. He co-founded the largest commercial bank in Costa Rica and his face is currently found on the front of the 5,000 colon bank note.

<text>The Correlates of War project is an academic study of the history of warfare. It was started in 1963 at the University of Michigan by political scientist J. David Singer. Concerned with collecting data about the history of wars and conflict among states, the project has driven forward quantitative research into the causes of warfare. The Correlates of War project seeks to facilitate the collection, dissemination, and use of accurate and reliable quantitative data in international relations. Key principles of the project include a commitment to standard scientific principles of replication, data reliability, documentation, review, and the transparency of data collection procedures.

The project has collected data on many attributes of international politics and national capabilities over time. Available data collected by the Correlates of War project start in 1816. The most widely used databases developed by the project include an identification of independent states since 1816, a list of interstate and civil wars since 1816, a list of &quot;militarized disputes&quot; (militarized crises that end short of war), and national capabilities measured annually for all countries since 1816 (including the size of countries&#x27; military, their energy consumption as a proxy for industrialization, population size, urbanized population, and raw material production of iron and steel). Other databases include an identification of all alliances since 1816, territorial relationships and changes over time, and membership in intergovernmental organizations. All Correlates of War databases are available free for public and academic use with proper citation.

In addition to generating these several data sets and constructing quantitative indicators of key variables that might turn out to be correlates of war, the project has completed and published a variety of statistical analyses and hypotheses. The data has also been used by researchers examining such relationships and seeking to explain when countries go to war or avoid it, when they trade, when they form alliances (and the effect of such alliances), and so on.

The project was transferred to Penn State University in March 2001. The director is Zeev Maoz, a political scientist at University of California, Davis.

==Country codes==
Singer&#x27;s group used a three-digit identification code for states (per the system since the Congress of Vienna) in their dataset correlated loosely with geography. The code was published in 1968 and 1980 to ease interoperability between researchers&#x27; datasets, and it became an important part of historical data science.

The main criteria to be identified as a state for the purpose of CoW are membership in the League of Nations or the United Nations, or a population of at least 500,000 and diplomatic recognition by two major powers. For membership to change, the status of a state must be changed for at least one month. Other criteria may include territorial occupation, and having an independent foreign policy and sovereign authority so that satellite states are excluded.

Researchers have modified CoW&#x27;s encodings for their specific needs, or have offered improved systems.

==Categories of wars==

The Correlates of War web site provides separate data sets (in different formats) for four different categories of wars:

* Non-State Wars: Between or among non-state entities.
* Intra-State Wars: Predominantly take place within the recognized territory of a state.
* Inter-State Wars: Occur between or among recognized states.
* Extra-State Wars: Between one or more states and a non-state entity outside the borders of the state.

The COW data includes a &quot;WarType&quot; variable assuming integer values 1-9. Interstate wars all have WarType 1. Extra-state wars are either &quot;colonial&quot; (WarType 2) to maintain control of a particular colony or &quot;imperial&quot; (WarType 3) to extend an empire. Intra-state wars are classified as either a civil war for central control (WarType 4), a civil war over local issues (WarType 5) a regional internal war (WarType 6), or an intercommunal war (WarType 7). Non-state wars are classified by whether they take place in non-state territory (WarType 8) or across state borders (WarType 9).

In each of these cases, a &quot;war must involve sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related combatant fatalities within a twelve month period.&quot;

<doc id="437283" wikidata="Q7338121" url="?curid=437283" title="Riverdale, Toronto">
<text>Riverdale is a large neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bounded by the Don River Valley to the west, Danforth Avenue and Greektown to the north, Jones Avenue, the CN/GO tracks, Leslieville to the east, and Lake Shore Boulevard to the south.

==History==
In 1875, the House of Refuge (later renamed Riverdale Hospital) opened at the corner of Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street East. The hospital took on its current name Bridgepoint Active Healthcare in 2002, and later expanded to include the former Don Jail in the Bridgepoint Redevelopment project. The hospital is now called Hennick Bridgepoint Hospital and is part of Sinai Health.

The 1884 annexation of the area then called Riverside Don Mount and Leslieville an area from the Don valley on the west to Greenwood on the east, and from Danforth on the north to Queen Street on the south.

Riverdale is located just east of Toronto&#x27;s downtown core. Since its amendment to the City of Toronto in 1884, it has developed a stature as a neighbourhood of independent arts, with several independent galleries located along Queen Street East. The residential landscape within Riverdale is made up primarily of Victorian and Edwardian style homes, constructed in the 1800s as boarding rooms for the working-class.

==Communities within Riverdale==

&quot;Riverdale&quot; can refer to a smaller area or a larger area around it as well. The smaller, core area of
Riverdale refers to the stretch of Toronto east of the Don Valley Parkway and west of Jones, between Danforth Avenue (north) and Gerrard Street (south). This area is occasionally referred to as &quot;North Riverdale&quot; or prime Riverdale. &quot;Riverdale&quot; sometimes is used to refer to a much wider area that includes &quot;South Riverdale&quot; and less frequently areas east of Jones. This area includes many smaller communities, usually centred around a &#x27;high street&#x27; or commercial area.

===Upper Riverdale and Lower Riverdale===
Some Riverdale residents differentiate between &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; Riverdale. &quot;Upper Riverdale&quot; is characterized as the part of the neighbourhood north of Riverdale Ave., and &quot;Lower Riverdale&quot; is the area south of Riverdale Ave. In terms of the quality of the housing supply, homes built in &quot;upper Riverdale&quot; are more likely to be renovated, but &quot;Lower Riverdale&quot; contains more original and classic designs of the late 19th century. There are a number of remarkable century-old homes built on Simpson and Langley Avenues, the latter street named after Toronto&#x27;s well-known early 20th century architect, and the former featuring the oldest Victorian houses in Riverdale. Of note, Simpson Avenue is home to the original six houses of Riverdale; located at the west end of the street and locally known as the &#x27;Six Sisters.&#x27;

===South Riverdale===

&quot;South Riverdale&quot;, as its name suggests, is the southern half of the Riverdale neighbourhood, south of Lower Riverdale. Its approximate boundaries are: the Don Valley Parkway to the west, Jones Ave. to the east, Gerrard Street East to the north, and Lake Shore Boulevard to the south.

South Riverdale comprises many smaller neighbourhoods:
====Riverside====
&quot;Riverside&quot;, also known as the &quot;Queen Broadview Village&quot; is a neighbourhood located within the larger neighbourhood of South Riverdale. The Riverside Business Improvement Area places the definite boundaries as running along the Don River and bordering the streets of Gerrard Street East, Empire Avenue, and Eastern Avenue.

Riverside is a mixed income and multicultural neighbourhood currently experiencing a trend of &quot;gentrification&quot; along Queen St. East and Broadview Ave. It had been home to the Don Destructor, a Toronto garbage incinerator which was demolished in 2004. Don Mount Court, a social housing project was recently redeveloped as a mixed social housing and market value community. The market value portion is being sold under the name Rivertowne.

Riverside is known for its many historic buildings and rich cultural heritage. The biggest landmark in the neighbourhood is the Broadview Hotel, a red sandstone commercial block in Romanesque style constructed in 1891–3, that was the tallest structure in South Riverdale for many decades. Other major landmarks include the Ralph Thornton Community Centre,(Queen Saulter branch Toronto Public Library) Broadview Lofts, and The Opera House. Riverside was also the location of Sunlight Park, Toronto&#x27;s first baseball stadium.

The area has a large young population, evident in the cluster of schools just east of Broadview Avenue. Dundas Junior Public School is the resident school for children in kindergarten through to fifth grade, after which they are transferred to Queen Alexandra Sr. Public School which sees students through to eighth grade. It is also home to the First Nations School of Toronto, a cultural survival school that places heavy emphasis on aboriginal values and culture, and SEED Alternative Secondary School, Canada&#x27;s first public alternative school.

Riverside is rapidly emerging as a district of independent design, furniture, and food retailers, as well as restaurants.

The southern industrial area was occupied by Lever Brothers Soap Factory from 1890s until 2009. The factory demolished is now waiting for redevelopment as commercial and industrial use by Cadillac Fairview.

====East Chinatown====
Toronto&#x27;s second largest Chinatown, also known as East Chinatown is found at Broadview &amp; Gerrard. At the northernmost corner of East Chinatown (northwest corner, Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street) is the Riverdale branch of the Toronto Public Library. This branch is bilingual in Chinese and English. North of the library is the monument to Sun Yat-sen. Construction on the Toronto Chinese Archway began in the western end of East Chinatown on November 24, 2008, and it opened to the public on September 12, 2009. There are only two streets with bilingual signs (English on top, Chinese on the bottom), Broadview Avenue (百樂匯街) and Gerrard Street East (芝蘭東街), and signs located three of the four corners of the intersection.

====Studio District====
The southern part of South Riverdale, just north of the Port Lands, is what&#x27;s called the &quot;Studio District&quot;. Industrial warehouses along Lakeshore Avenue house production studios, and many people working in film and television live in the old Victorians found along the area&#x27;s side streets. Carlaw and Queen has become an arts hub, with many artists choosing to run their studios from the various work-live lofts.

=== Blake-Jones ===

&quot;Blake-Jones&quot; is a section of tree-lined streets with residences built from the 1870s to 1930s. The neighbourhood extends along Jones Avenue commencing at the cemetery south of Strathcona and extending down to Hunter. It is bordered by Danforth Avenue to the north, Pape Avenue to the west, Greenwood Avenue to the east and the CN Railway tracks just south of Riverdale/Boultbee Avenue to the south. Houses along Blake Street are more affordable in this neighbourhood than in many areas of the city because most of the homes are semi-detached. There are also a significant number of residents within public housing, residing in apartment and townhouse complex of Blake/Boultbee, owned by Toronto Community Housing. With a 33.3% unemployment rate in youth aged 15–19, the Blake-Jones corridor of Riverdale has seen an increase in crime in recent years.

There are two local elementary schools zoned to the area; Blake Street (which also houses East end Alternative) and Pape Avenue. The high school that is zoned to the area is Riverdale Collegiate Institute.

The neighbourhood is served by the Pape, Donlands, and Greenwood subway stations and the 72 Pape and 83 Jones bus routes and is also home to the Greenwood Subway Yard, a landmark within the area.

====The Pocket====
Located within Blake-Jones is an area residents refer to as &quot;The Pocket&quot;. Over time there have been some differences on the exact definition of the area, but currently the Pocket is understood to be &quot;accessible only from the west along Jones Avenue&quot;. This would indicate that the area would be bordered by Chatham Street at the north (which itself is not accessible from Jones, except by bicycles on the recently created bike lane), and on the southern end by Boultbee Ave. The Eastern side is bordered by the TTC Greenwood yard. As of January 2013 the Pocket Community Association declared they served an area that is &quot;bounded on the west by Jones Ave, on the east by Greenwood Avenue, on the north by Danforth Ave, and on the south by the railroad tracks abutting Boultbee Avenue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The community is served by the Pocket Community Association.

The name &quot;The Pocket&quot; was created by area residents during a planning session attended by Susan McMurray, also an editor of a newsletter for the area. The name has stuck in part because of the &quot;village feel&quot; of the community, and has become well used by residents and realtors in the area. The Pocket has been experiencing a gentrification similar of that to the most of Riverdale and other neighbourhoods within Toronto. For The Pocket, this started in the 1990s. The neighbourhood is listed as one of the ten hottest areas in Toronto Life and is described as &quot;coveted&quot; by the Globe and Mail indicating that buyers will pay a premium to live in the community. The Pocket has an above average number of people from the Muslim and Greek Orthodox communities living in the area.

The area has benefitted from a strong group of volunteers who have done much to make the area safer and prettier. Such projects as cleaning up and renaming Ben Kerr Lane, an annual street party on Dawson Avenue, street sales, organized pot lucks, not to mention a great number of improvements to Phin Park. Phin Park has had a number of mature trees planted along its central lighted walkway, an outdoor ice rink created every winter, the placement of large boulders removed during street work, and the building of a gazebo next to the playground for parents to cool off while their children play. Throughout the year there are events at the park organized and paid for by the community including monthly movie nights and an excellent fireworks show on Victoria Day. Another beautification project included building a small orchard and community garden area north of the Greenwood TTC yard.

===Badgerow===
The area bounded by Dundas St. East in the south, Jones Ave. to the east, the railway tracks to the north, and Carlaw Ave. to the west is also referred to by local residents as &quot;Badgerow&quot;, after a residential street that runs through the centre of that area. This pocket includes the legendary Maple Leaf Tavern, as well as a Sikh temple, Turkish cultural centre and Jewish cemetery, in addition to the Gerrard Square shopping mall.

==Culture==
Riverdale&#x27;s character is composed primarily from its multiculturalism; with several cultural neighbourhoods along its major paths. Danforth Avenue (commonly referred to as &quot;The Danforth&quot; in Greek Town) has a high concentration of Greek restaurants while Gerrard Street East and parts of Broadview Avenue are home to a variety of Asian shops and restaurants (referred to as East Chinatown). South of Queen Street East are several large corporate film studios extending down to the waterfront. Riverdale is home to the Gerrard Square Mall; which features a variety of retail, restaurant, and small shops. The neighbourhood&#x27;s character is also defined by the CN Railway, which separates the area into two districts.

==Education==

There are four Toronto-based school boards that provides public education for the city, including the neighbourhood of Riverdale. Two of the four Toronto-based school boards teach primarily in English, the secular Toronto District School Board, and the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board. The institutions operated by the other two Toronto-based school boards, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), are a French first language public school board. However, CSV does not operate a school in Riverdale.

Both CSCM and TCDSB operates one public elementary school in Riverdale. CSCM operates, École élémentaire catholique du Bon-Berger, whereas TCDSB operates Holy Name Catholic School. Holy Name was founded in 1913 by the Sisters of St. Joseph with four classrooms. Eight more classrooms were added in 1918. In 1931, two more portables were installed and 8 room addition was built in 1949 totalling to 20 classrooms. To service the ever-increasing population an annex was built in 1957 and extended in 1961 to provide a total of 31 classrooms but it was joined to the main building providing a library, a gymnasium and several more classrooms in 1968. Holy Name is a feeder school for graduates who would later attend St. Patrick, Neil McNeil and Notre Dame secondary schools, all of which are located outside Riverdale.

TDSB is the only school board that operates a secondary school in the neighbourhood, Riverdale Collegiate Institute. In addition to the secondary school, TDSB operates City Adult Learning Centre, one of five Toronto District School Board adult learning centres serving the area. The building was built in 1963 as &quot;Parkway Vocational School&quot; as a vocational school, which traces back to &quot;Jarvis Junior Vocational School&quot; as an extension to Jarvis Collegiate Institute. Parkway was later renamed to &quot;Parkview Secondary School&quot; and was closed in 1983 due to low enrolment.

In addition to secondary education, TDSB operate a number of public schools. TDSB schools in Riverdale include:
* &quot;Earl Grey Senior Public School&quot; is the area&#x27;s local middle school, grade 7–8.
* &quot;Quest Alternative School&quot; is the area&#x27;s original alternative middle school, and one of the first in Toronto. Consisting of 68 students and 4 staff, Quest celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2008. The school&#x27;s motto is: &quot;Structure to learn and freedom to grow&quot;, and its focus is on student-centered learning and diverse curriculum.
* &quot;East Alternative School of Toronto&quot; is another local alternative middle school, specializing in social justice and visual arts. It also has 68 students and accepts students from all over Toronto.
* &quot;Withrow Avenue Junior Public School&quot;, &quot;Jackman Avenue Junior Public School&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;14/09/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Frankland Community School&quot;, and &quot;Pape Avenue Junior Public School&quot; are the four local junior public schools in North Riverdale.

In addition to public schooling, Riverdale is home to private schools as well. Montcrest School is located on Montcrest Boulevard and in several converted houses on Broadview Avenue just north of Riverdale Park. The school has been in operation since 1961, previously operating under the name &quot;The January School&quot;.

==Politics==
===Provincial politics===

Riverdale is in the provincial riding of Toronto—Danforth, and is currently represented in the Ontario provincial parliament by Peter Tabuns, deputy leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. Municipally, Riverdale is in Toronto Ward 30, represented by Toronto city councillor Paula Fletcher. Federally it is represented by Julie Dabrusin of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Provincially, the riding was known as Riverdale from the 1914 Ontario provincial election until the 1999 Ontario provincial election when the number of provincial ridings were reduced and given the same borders and names as federal ridings, in this case Broadview—Greenwood and, more recently, Toronto—Danforth. In all its guises it has elected a New Democrat in every election since 1963.

In 1964 a by-election set the model for future NDP campaigns. Under the campaign management of Gerald Caplan, Stephen Lewis, and Marjorie Pinney the NDP canvassed every household three times, identified all their supporters, and then they got out the vote. This strategy is also known as PIG, &quot;Persuade, Identify, Get out the vote&quot;. Lawyer Jim Renwick won with 7,287 votes compared to 5,774 votes for the Conservatives and 5,771 votes for the Liberals.

===Federal politics===
Federally the riding, known for many years as Broadview and then Broadview—Greenwood, has been represented by New Democrats from 1962 (the first federal election after the party was formed) until 1988, when Liberal Dennis Mills won the seat. Mills held the riding until 2004, when NDP leader Jack Layton won the seat.

==Recreation==

There are three medium to large sized parks in Riverdale. At the west edge between Broadview Avenue and the Don Valley Parkway just north of Bridgepoint Health is Riverdale Park. This park features a running track, three baseball diamonds, a skating rink, a public swimming pool and tennis courts. Just to the east of Riverdale Park is Withrow Park which has a large off-leash dog area, an ice rink, two baseball diamonds, play structures, and a soccer field. In South Riverdale is Jimmie Simpson Park which contains tennis courts and a community centre. In the southwest corner just north of Queen St. East on Broadview Avenue is the Royal Canadian Curling Club. The curling club features six sheets and hosts leagues for about 500 members. The last park in Riverdale located further east along Blake Street is Kempton Howard Park (formerly East View Park) and was renamed in 2007 in honour of a youth worker who was killed in 2003 in the Blake/Boultbee community in which he lived and worked. Hubbard Park located next to Riverdale Library is named for William Peyton Hubbard.

These three parks serve as great landmarks within the neighbourhood that many residents use for various activities, from swimming in outdoor pools to tobogganing down the steep hills in Riverdale Park during the wintertime. These are the most common outdoor spaces within the area and according to Toronto&#x27;s Official Plan, are to be preserved as an area of green space in the years to come.

On 27 January 1917 he and his brother José Joaquín seized power in a coup d&#x27;état and established a repressive military dictatorship that attempted to crush all opposition. Though his government won support from the upper classes because it turned back the austerity measures adopted by President González, and declared war on the German Empire in May 1918, it failed to win the recognition of the United States, where President Woodrow Wilson supported the deposed government.

Popular sentiment against Tinoco, which began on 13 June 1919, quickly came to a head, and his brother was assassinated in early August. On August 13 Tinoco resigned in favor of Juan Bautista Quirós and went into exile in Europe. He died in Paris in 1931.

Due to a dispute over the legitimacy of the government of Tinoco, Costa Rica was not a party to the Treaty of Versailles and did not unilaterally end the state of war between itself and Germany. The technical state of war ended after World War II only after they were included in the Potsdam Agreement. Costa Rica did issue a declaration of war against Germany again on 11 December 1941.

<text>Robert Francis Convey (; born May 27, 1983) is an American former professional soccer player who last played for New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer.

In addition to several MLS clubs, Convey spent five years in England with Reading, whom he helped gain promotion to the Premier League for the first time. He played in 46 international matches for the United States, and made their squads for the 2003 Gold Cup and 2006 World Cup.

==Career==

===Youth===
Convey attended the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia and played club soccer for the Philadelphia Soccer Club Coppa. He was a member of the initial class of the Bradenton Academy that also included current and former national team members Landon Donovan, Oguchi Onyewu and DaMarcus Beasley. Together they helped lead the Under-17 squad to a fourth-place finish in the 1999 U-17 World Cup in New Zealand.

===Professional===

====D.C. United====
Convey was drafted in 2000 in the first round by D.C. United of Major League Soccer. That year, he became the youngest player ever signed by MLS. Convey was originally slated to play the majority of the season with the Project-40 squad; however, as United faltered he was called upon to step in and perform almost immediately. He played 22 games for United in 2000, starting 18 of those. Convey entered his first game in United&#x27;s 4–0 loss to Los Angeles Galaxy in the home opener at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium on March 25, 2000, and was awarded his first start in United&#x27;s 2–1 loss at the Columbus Crew on May 3, 2000. It was not until July 4, 2000, against the Colorado Rapids that Convey served up Raúl Díaz Arce at the far post for a header past a helpless David Kramer. The teenager also was impressive against English Premier League side Newcastle United, when the Magpies visited D.C. during a pre-season training stint in the U.S. Convey&#x27;s two assists and high work rate during that friendly were enough to draw the attention of Newcastle&#x27;s famed manager Bobby Robson. In four and a half seasons in MLS, Convey finished with eight goals and 16 assists.

====Reading====

Convey looked set to move to Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League in the summer of 2003, when the London club agreed to a $3 million move with MLS, but the transfer stalled when his work permit application was denied due to his lack of appearances with the senior national team. Then, on July 22, 2004, after five seasons with D.C. United, Convey signed a three-year contract with Reading, who were then playing in the Championship. His transfer fee was around £900,000, the highest paid by Reading up to that date.

Convey made his debut for his new club in a 1–0 loss away to West Ham United, coming on as a substitute. He made his first start a few days later during a 1–0 Reading victory over Sheffield United on August 14, 2004. However, the start of his career in England lacked distinction, as Convey made only seven starts and 15 substitute appearances during the 2004–05 season.

Convey entered the 2005–06 season in much better form, with a starting place in the team, and he helped the Royals win the Championship title setting a new English record of 106 points in 46 games to gain promotion to the Premier League for the 2006–07 season. Convey&#x27;s first goals for the club came during a 5–0 victory over Millwall.

Convey&#x27;s first season in the Premier League started with Reading&#x27;s 3–2 win over Middlesbrough on August 19, 2006. However, Convey missed much of the remainder of the season following a training ground injury in October 2006 and subsequent knee operations.

He returned from injury on July 28, 2007, playing the first half in a pre-season friendly match against Brighton, appearing &quot;comfortable and in good shape&quot;, according to the team&#x27;s match report. He returned to competitive football for Reading in the club&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Everton on August 18, 2007.

On February 6, 2009, Convey and Reading reached a mutual agreement on Convey&#x27;s release from the club.

====San Jose Earthquakes====

Four days after being released by Reading, Convey returned to MLS, signing with the San Jose Earthquakes. He scored his first goal for the Quakes on April 11, 2009, against the Chicago Fire, while playing left-back. In 2010, Convey recorded 10 assists and was given the MLS Comeback Player of the Year Award. After a fractious relationship with manager Frank Yallop, it was announced that Convey would not be returning to San Jose for the 2012 season. In his three seasons at the club, Convey appeared in 75 league matches and scored three goals.

====Sporting Kansas City====
On December 2, 2011, Sporting Kansas City announced that it had acquired Convey in exchange for use of an international roster slot during the 2012 season.

====Toronto FC====
On May 16, 2013, Toronto FC announced that it had acquired Convey from Sporting KC in exchange for a third round pick in the 2014 MLS SuperDraft. In his only season in Toronto Convey appeared in 21 matches and tallied 1 goal and 4 assists.

====New York Red Bulls====
On December 13, 2013, Convey was traded to New York along with a 2014 MLS SuperDraft second-round pick in exchange for a 2014 MLS SuperDraft first-round pick and a 2016 MLS SuperDraft third-round pick.

After an injury-plagued 2014 season, Convey&#x27;s 2015 contract option was declined by New York on December 2, 2014.

Convey subsequently retired without making an announcement, but in 2017, he claimed that he was suffering from Asthma attacks, which left him fighting for his life. On his Instagram account, he posted: &quot;I retired from soccer and didn&#x27;t really talk about it as it was just kind of forced upon me and extremely depressing at times...I have had 2 separate surgeries and 4 separate hospitalizations since I retired 2 seasons ago...This morning I was almost unconscious being physically carried out of my house to the ambulance by four firefighters to the hospital where they cut my clothes off to administer four breathing treatments and three separate steroid injections as my airways were completely closed up...The doctor said I was way too close this time.&quot;

===International===
Convey received his first cap for the senior United States team on October 25, 2000, against Mexico, becoming the third-youngest player in U.S. soccer history to do so. Convey captained the under-20 team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates. He was named to the 23-man squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, wearing number 15. It was his slicing free kick that resulted in the own goal against Italy which settled the outcome of the 1–1 draw. He and teammate Marcus Hahnemann were the first Reading players to play in the World Cup. He played in all three games as the United States exited in the first round. Convey earned 46 caps and scored one goal for the United States national team from 2000 to 2008.

====International goals====

<doc id="437301" wikidata="Q1665150" url="?curid=437301" title="Institute of Cetacean Research">
<text>The is a Japanese research organization that claims to specialise in &quot;biological and social sciences related to whales&quot; but is widely believed to be a front for commercial whaling. 

In the past, it killed several hundred whales per year in the name of its &#x27;research&#x27;, the validity and necessity of which has been called into question. Among its activities, the ICR also used to sell &quot;whale research byproducts&quot; commercially, which environmental groups denounced as commercial whaling in disguise, which is banned by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In March 2014, the International Court of Justice formally ruled that the ICR&#x27;s whaling program was not for scientific purposes, as claimed, and ordered Japan to immediately cease its operation.

In 2019, the Japanese government resumed commercial whaling, and, in March 2020, the ICR ended its sale of &quot;whale research byproducts&quot;, claiming that the institute would only carry out non-lethal research moving forward.
== History ==
The Institute of Cetacean Research was founded in 1987. It took over from the Whales Research Institute (founded in 1947), which grew out of the Nakabe Scientific Research Centre (founded in 1941). The New Zealand-based spokesman for the group is the public relations agent, Glenn Inwood.

The Whales Research Institute conducted research based on catches from commercial whaling. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) established a moratorium on commercial whaling after 1986. The ICR was established the following year to continue the &quot;scientific research&quot;.

== Regulations ==
Under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), the IWC established a global ban on commercial whaling. Article VIII, Section 1 creates an exemption, however, providing that:
Further, Section 2 states: 

Since its establishment, the institute has been granted annual catch quotas by the Government of Japan to carry out its research. The whale meat, which is by definition a by-product of the research, is sold for domestic consumption in accordance with the convention.

From 1988 through the first half of 2011, a total of 13,663 whales have been caught by the ICR under the above exemption for scientific research. Of those, 3,573 whales have been taken in the North Pacific Ocean, and 10,090 have been taken in the Southern Ocean, an area which in 1994 was designated as the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary by the IWC.

In March 2014 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Japan to cease the JARPA II programme stating that its Antarctic whaling was in contravention of the IWC moratoria 10(e) and 10(d).

== Research programs ==

Under its whale research programs, the ICR collected its samples from the Antarctic Ocean and the northwestern Pacific Ocean under special permit from the Government of Japan (JARPA and JARPA II programs). It claims these samples were used for studies related to estimation of biological parameters, resource abundance, elucidation of stock structure, and the role of whales in the marine ecosystem, and elucidation of the effect of environmental changes on cetaceans.

The ICR also claims to have conducted sighting surveys in the southern hemisphere and the north Pacific to elucidate trends in abundance, density, distribution, and behavior of whales. These surveys include the IWC Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research (SOWER) program.

=== JARPA (Antarctic Ocean) ===
The first Antarctic program took place from 1987 to 2005, with the stated objectives of trying to determine mortality rates, whale stock numbers and structure, the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem and how environmental changes are affecting whales. The whaling operation alternated between several pre-established areas intending to take 400 or more minke whales per season.

In 1997 the IWC scientific committee reviewed the JARPA program and disagreed on whether the ICR&#x27;s lethal methods were necessary, but it was concluded that the results could potentially allow for an increase in the number of minke whales killed.

In the final 2007 review the committee recognized that progress had been made in identifying stock structure, but found problems with the age and mortality rate data and most of the ICR&#x27;s other data collection and analysis efforts. The commission also noted the catches took place in the IWC established Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and that improving management of whaling in a sanctuary was unnecessary. The 2007-1 resolution on JARPA was one of several calling on Japan by majority vote to suspend its lethal research.

=== JARPN (northwestern Pacific Ocean) ===
From 1994 to 1999, the ICR carried out a program in the northwestern Pacific. Its stated goals were to improve knowledge of stock identity, improve implementation simulation trials for north Pacific common Minke whales and act as a feasibility study for a program on feeding ecology. The program called for 100 minke whales to be killed annually. The results were reviewed in February, 2000 by the IWC committee, which agreed that the information was useful for management but reached no consensus was reached on whether lethal methods of research were necessary. As with JARPA, the IWC issued resolutions calling for Japan to cease issuing permits for the take of Minke whales citing concerns over the need for lethal methods such as the 1999-3 Resolution on whaling under Special Permit.

=== JARPA II ===
The JARPA II Antarctic program began in 2005 and called for hunting 850 or more Antarctic minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales per season. The quota for humpback whales was not implemented due to intense international opposition. Disagreement over the value of the research, the use of lethal methods and the sample sizes continued in both the scientific committee and the commission. In 2005 and 2007 the commission passed resolutions by majority urging Japan to stop all lethal research in JARPA II.

On 31 March 2014, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that JARPA II was not for scientific purposes and forbade further permits. Following the ruling, Japan cancelled its Antarctic whaling hunt for the first time in more than 25 years, though it announced plans to propose a new research program designed to meet the standards set by the ICJ the following year.

=== JARPN II ===
JARPN II began with a feasibility study from 2000 to 2001 that included the killing of 100 common minke whales, 50 Bryde&#x27;s whales, and 10 sperm whales. In 2002, after completing its initial study, the ICR proposed a longer-term program in the Pacific within Japan&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2008 the program included a proposal for an annual take of 340 minke whales, 50 Bryde&#x27;s whales, 100 sei and 10 sperm whales.

Disagreement over the objectives, methodology, effect on stocks and overall success of the program continued in the scientific committee review of the feasibility study and full program. The full program introduced a change from previous use of the ICRW Article VIII research provision by not specifying an end date. Despite this, its methodology was also not deemed likely to add significantly to previously identified research needs. Some IWC members contended the program placed undue emphasis on assumed negative effects of cetacean predation on fishery resources while failing to address the effects of fisheries on cetaceans. Others believed determining the effects of cetaceans on fish stocks and more information on Minke stock structure to be critically important.

Disagreement over the value of data obtained through lethal methods continued. It was argued that a wide range of questions could be answered through non-lethal means such as &quot;for pollutant monitoring (biopsy sampling for fatty acid and stable isotope analysis), for stock structure (photo identification, biopsy sampling and faecal sampling), and for feeding ecology (faecal sampling).&quot;

In 2000, 2001 and 2003, more resolutions were passed by the IWC urging Japan to cease issuing special permits for whaling and limit research to non-lethal methods. The most recent Scientific Committee review was conducted in January 2009.

== Controversy ==

Several environmental groups and governments oppose the Japanese research program, claiming it to be &quot;a disguise for commercial whaling&quot;.

=== Disputes over research ===
The Institute of Cetacean Research has been reported to have &quot;produced virtually no research of any regard&quot; and has only two peer-reviewed papers since 2005.
In an open letter to the Japanese government, published in 2002 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 21 scientists declared that they &quot;believe Japan&#x27;s whale &quot;research&quot; program fails to meet minimum standards for credible science&quot;. They were &quot;concerned that Japan&#x27;s whaling program is not designed to answer scientific questions relevant to the management of whales; that Japan refuses to make the information it collects available for independent review; and that its research program lacks a testable hypothesis or other performance indicators consistent with accepted scientific standards&quot;. They accused Japan of &quot;using the pretense of scientific research to evade its commitments to the world community&quot;.

The Institute of Cetacean Research responded by pointing out that it has produced numerous peer-reviewed articles on cetacean science, criticised the open letter as a case of scientists making judgments outside their own area of speciality, and raised concern about their responsibility as academics to the public. The ICR further noted that the letter contained numerous errors of science and law, reflecting the level of care taken by the scientists endorsing the letter.

A WWF official responded in the same journal, pointing out that &quot;identical criticisms of Japanese whaling had been published by expert whale biologists on the International Whaling Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee&quot; and that three of the letter&#x27;s authors defending the Japanese programs had failed to disclose significant financial and organizational ties to the whaling industry.

In the same issue, twenty members of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission confirmed &quot;that the signers of the open letter correctly summarized criticisms made by researchers very familiar with Japanese scientific whaling&quot;, a fact omitted by the letter&#x27;s critics, &quot;betraying a selectiveness that pervades their article&quot;. According to them, &quot;so little of any significance to IWC management can be obtained only from whaling catches that it is impossible to justify killing animals on this basis&quot;.

The International Whaling Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee has repeatedly expressed concern for the objectives and results obtained by the ICR. In a resolution in 2007, the IWC noted that &quot;none of the goals of JARPA 1 had been reached, and that the results of the JARPA 1 [Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic] programme are not required for management under the RMP [Revised Management Procedure]&quot; and called upon the Japanese government &quot;to address the 31 recommendations listed in [the Scientific Committee&#x27;s JARPA 1 report] to the satisfaction of the Scientific Committee&quot; and &quot;to suspend indefinitely the lethal aspects of JARPA II conducted within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary&quot;.

In 2008 the ICR was criticized by anti-whaling proponents when photographs released by the Australian government showed pictures of the ICR harpoon ship &quot;Yushin Maru&quot; killing several different whales, and a whale and her calf being taken on board the &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; for processing The Australian government used that opportunity to voice their disbelief of the ICR&#x27;s scientific research claims:

Animal rights groups such as Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have repeatedly attacked the institute&#x27;s vessels and personnel while carrying out their duties. In 2010, an employee of the institute reportedly sustained chemical burns to his face from a butyric acid projectile launched by a member of the Sea Shepherd organisation.

On December 17, 2012, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction against Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd and any party acting in concert with them from physically attacking any person or vessel of the Institute of Cetacean Research and requiring them to stay at least from their vessels.

On March 31, 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan&#x27;s whaling program was not for scientific purposes and forbade the granting of further permits. The court&#x27;s judges agreed with Australia that the number of Japanese scientific research publications were not proportionate to the number of animals killed. Two former Australian Environment ministers applauded the decision and stated their hopes that Japan will respect it. The decision of the ICJ is final and the right of appeal does not apply in this context. Japan said it would abide by the decision.

In November 2014, Japan announced that it would resume hunting whales in the Southern Ocean, but that it would reduce its catch target by two-thirds. Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Agency said that Japan intends to catch 333 minke whales each year between 2015 and 2027, down from 935 minke and 50 fin whales. It said the hunts were needed for collecting scientific data and were exempt from a 1986 international ban on commercial whaling. The plan also included a defined 12-year period for research, in response to criticism from the ICJ of the previous open-ended research plans. In January 2015, the Japanese Fisheries Agency announced that the ICR was launching a non-lethal whale research programme until March 28. In 2017, the researchers at Catacean Research killed 333 minke whales in the name of whale research program, 67% of which were pregnant.

=== Financial subsidies ===
There are estimates by the World Wildlife Fund that the Japanese government has had to invest US$12 million into the 2008-2009 hunt alone just to break even, and that subsidies in total have amounted to approximately US$150 million between 1988 and 2010.

In 2011, the ICR was provided US$29 million in financial assistance from the earthquake recovery fund, a supplementary budget of US$230 billion passed by the Japanese Government for reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The funding was provided to increase security for the whaling fleet in light of increasing attacks by Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and justified by the Japan Fisheries Agency as providing support to the whaling industry as a whole, including some whaling towns along the devastated northeast coast. No foreign or donated funds were used.

Following the September 2018 Florianopolis Declaration where the IWC rejected Japan&#x27;s latest commercial hunt proposal, and concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales, Japan withdrew its IWC membership on December 26, 2018. It then resumed commercial hunting in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone on July 1, 2019, but ceased whaling activities in the Antarctic Ocean. Japan expects to hunt 227 minke whales by the end of 2019, but without government subsidies, their whaling industry is not expected to survive. A subsidy of 5.1 billion yen (US$47.31 million) was budgeted for commercial whaling in 2019. ICR activities continue.

<text>Marwan ibn al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As ibn Umayya (; 623 or 626April/May 685), commonly known as MarwanI, was the fourth Umayyad caliph, ruling for less than a year in 684–685. He founded the Marwanid ruling house of the Umayyad dynasty, which replaced the Sufyanid house after its collapse in the Second Fitna and remained in power until 750.

During the reign of his cousin Uthman (), Marwan took part in a military campaign against the Byzantines of the Exarchate of Africa (in central North Africa), where he acquired significant war spoils. He also served as Uthman&#x27;s governor in Fars (southwestern Iran) before becoming the caliph&#x27;s (secretary or scribe). He was wounded fighting the rebel siege of Uthman&#x27;s house, in which the caliph was slain. In the ensuing civil war between Ali () and the largely Qurayshite partisans of A&#x27;isha, Marwan sided with the latter at the Battle of the Camel. Marwan later served as governor of Medina under his distant kinsman Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (), founder of the Umayyad Caliphate. During the reign of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s son and successor Yazid I (), Marwan organized the defense of the Umayyad realm in the Hejaz (western Arabia) against the local opposition which included prominent companions as well as Muhammad’s own clan, the Bani Hashim, who revolted under the banner of Muhammad’s grandson, Husayn ibn Ali. After Yazid died in November 683, the Mecca-based rebel Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph and expelled Marwan, who took refuge in Syria, the center of Umayyad rule. With the death of the last Sufyanid caliph Mu&#x27;awiya II in 684, Marwan, encouraged by the ex-governor of Iraq Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, volunteered his candidacy for the caliphate during a summit of pro-Umayyad tribes in Jabiya. The tribal nobility, led by Ibn Bahdal of the Banu Kalb, elected Marwan and together they defeated the pro-Zubayrid Qays tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit in August of that year.

In the months that followed, Marwan reasserted Umayyad rule over Egypt, Palestine, and northern Syria, whose governors had defected to Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s cause, while keeping the Qays in check in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). He dispatched an expedition led by Ibn Ziyad to reconquer Zubayrid Iraq, but died while it was underway in the spring of 685. Before his death, Marwan firmly established his sons in positions of power: Abd al-Malik was designated his successor, Abd al-Aziz was made governor of Egypt, and Muhammad oversaw military command in Upper Mesopotamia. Although Marwan was stigmatized as an outlaw and a father of tyrants in later anti-Umayyad tradition, the historian Clifford E. Bosworth asserts that the caliph was a shrewd, capable, and decisive military leader and statesman who laid the foundations of continued Umayyad rule for a further sixty-five years.

==Early life and family==

Marwan was born in 2 or 4 AH (623 or 626 CE). His father was al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As of the Banu Umayya (Umayyads), the strongest clan of the Quraysh, a polytheistic tribe which dominated the town of Mecca in the Hejaz. The Quraysh converted to Islam en masse in following the conquest of Mecca by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, himself a member of the Quraysh. Marwan knew Muhammad and is thus counted among the latter&#x27;s (companions). Marwan&#x27;s mother was Amina bint Alqama of the Kinana, the ancestral tribe of the Quraysh which dominated the area stretching southwest from Mecca to the Tihama coastline.

Marwan had at least sixteen children, among them at least twelve sons from five wives and an (concubine). From his wife A&#x27;isha, a daughter of his paternal first cousin Mu&#x27;awiya ibn al-Mughira, he had his eldest son Abd al-Malik, Mu&#x27;awiya and daughter Umm Amr. Umm Amr later married Sa&#x27;id ibn Khalid ibn Amr, a great-grandson of Marwan&#x27;s paternal first cousin Uthman ibn Affan, who became caliph (leader of the Muslim community) in 644. Marwan&#x27;s wife Layla bint Zabban ibn al-Asbagh of the Banu Kalb tribe bore him Abd al-Aziz and daughter Umm Uthman, who was married to Caliph Uthman&#x27;s son al-Walid; al-Walid was also married at one point to Marwan&#x27;s daughter Umm Amr. Another of Marwan&#x27;s wives, Qutayya bint Bishr of the Banu Kilab, bore him Bishr and Abd al-Rahman, the latter of whom died young. One of Marwan&#x27;s wives, Umm Aban al-Kubra, was a daughter of Caliph Uthman. She was mother to six of his sons, Aban, Uthman, Ubayd Allah, Ayyub, Dawud and Abd Allah, though the last of them died a child. Marwan was married to Zaynab bint Umar, a granddaughter of Abu Salama from the Banu Makhzum, who mothered his son Umar. Marwan&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was also named Zaynab and gave birth to his son Muhammad. Marwan had ten brothers and was the paternal uncle of ten nephews.

==Secretary of Uthman==

During the reign of Caliph Uthman (), Marwan took part in a military campaign against the Byzantines of the Exarchate of Carthage (in central North Africa), where he acquired significant war spoils. These likely formed the basis of Marwan&#x27;s substantial wealth, part of which he invested in properties in Medina, the capital of the Caliphate. At an undetermined point, he served as Uthman&#x27;s governor in Fars (southwestern Iran) before becoming the caliph&#x27;s (secretary or scribe) and possibly the overseer of Medina&#x27;s treasury. According to the historian Clifford E. Bosworth, in this capacity Marwan &quot;doubtless helped&quot; in the revision &quot;of what became the canonical text of the Qur&#x27;an&quot; in Uthman&#x27;s reign.

The historian Hugh Kennedy asserts that Marwan was the caliph&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot;. According to the traditional Muslim reports, many of Uthman&#x27;s erstwhile backers among the Quraysh gradually withdrew their support as a result of Marwan&#x27;s pervasive influence, which they blamed for the caliph&#x27;s controversial decisions. The historian Fred Donner questions the veracity of these reports, citing the unlikelihood that Uthman would be highly influenced by a younger relative such as Marwan and the rarity of specific charges against the latter, and describes them as a possible &quot;attempt by later Islamic tradition to salvage Uthman&#x27;s reputation as one of the so-called &#x27;rightly-guided&#x27; () caliphs by making Marwan... the fall guy for the unhappy events at the end of Uthman&#x27;s twelve-year reign.&quot;

Discontent over Uthman&#x27;s nepotistic policies and confiscation of the former Sasanian crown lands in Iraq drove the Quraysh and the dispossessed elites of Kufa and Egypt to oppose the caliph. In early 656, rebels from Egypt and Kufa entered Medina to press Uthman to reverse his policies. Marwan recommended a violent response against them. Instead, Uthman entered into a settlement with the Egyptians, the largest and most outspoken group among the mutineers. On their return to Egypt, the rebels intercepted a letter in Uthman&#x27;s name to Egypt&#x27;s governor, Ibn Abi Sarh, instructing him to take action against the rebels. In reaction, the Egyptians marched back to Medina and besieged Uthman in his home in June 656. Uthman claimed to have been unaware of the letter, and it may have been authored by Marwan without Uthman&#x27;s knowledge. Despite orders to the contrary, Marwan actively defended Uthman&#x27;s house and was badly wounded in the neck when he challenged the rebels assembled at its entrance. According to tradition, he was saved by the intervention of his wet nurse, Fatima bint Aws, and was transported to the safety of her home by his (freedman or client), Abu Hafs al-Yamani. Shortly after, Uthman was assassinated by the rebels, which became one of the major contributing factors to the First Fitna. After the assassination, Marwan and other Umayyads fled to Mecca. Calls for avenging Uthman&#x27;s death were led by the Umayyads, one of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, A&#x27;isha, and two of his prominent companions, al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Talha ibn Ubayd Allah. Punishing Uthman&#x27;s murderers became a rallying cry of the opposition to his successor, Ali ibn Abi Talib, a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad.

===Role in the First Fitna===

In the ensuing hostilities between Ali and the largely Qurayshite partisans of A&#x27;isha, Marwan sided with the latter. He fought alongside A&#x27;isha&#x27;s forces at the Battle of the Camel near Basra in December 656. The historian Leone Caetani presumed that Marwan was the organizer of A&#x27;isha&#x27;s strategy there. The modern historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri notes that while Caetani&#x27;s &quot;theory is attractive&quot;, there is no information in the traditional sources to confirm it and should Marwan have been A&#x27;isha&#x27;s war adviser &quot;he operated so discreetly that the sources hardly speak of his actions.&quot;

According to one version in the Islamic tradition, Marwan used the occasion of the battle to kill a partisan of A&#x27;isha, Talha, whom he held especially responsible for instigating Uthman&#x27;s death. Marwan had fired an arrow at Talha, which struck the sciatic vein below his knee, as their troops fell back in a hand-to-hand fight with Ali&#x27;s soldiers. The historian Wilferd Madelung notes that Marwan &quot;evidently&quot; waited to kill Talha when A&#x27;isha appeared close to defeat and thus in a weak position to call Marwan to account for his action. Another version in the tradition attributes Talha&#x27;s death to Ali&#x27;s supporters during Talha&#x27;s retreat from the field, and Caetani dismisses Marwan&#x27;s culpability as a fabrication by the generally anti-Umayyad sources. Madelung holds that Marwan&#x27;s slaying of Talha is corroborated by Umayyad propaganda in the 680s heralding him as the first person to take revenge for Uthman&#x27;s death by killing Talha.

After the battle ended with Ali&#x27;s victory, Marwan pledged his allegiance to him. Ali pardoned him and Marwan left for Syria, where his distant cousin Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, who refused allegiance to Ali, was governor. Marwan was present alongside Mu&#x27;awiya at the Battle of Siffin near Raqqa in 657, which ended in a stalemate with Ali&#x27;s army and abortive arbitration talks to settle the civil war.

==Governor of Medina==

Ali was assassinated by a member of the Kharijites, a sect opposed to both Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya, in January 661. His son and successor Hasan ibn Ali abdicated in a peace treaty with Mu&#x27;awiya, who entered Hasan&#x27;s and formerly Ali&#x27;s capital at Kufa and gained recognition as caliph there in July or September, marking the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate. Marwan served as Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s governor in Bahrayn (eastern Arabia) before serving two stints as governor of Medina in 661–668 and 674–677. In between those two terms, Marwan&#x27;s Umayyad kinsmen Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As and al-Walid ibn Utba ibn Abi Sufyan held the post. Medina had lost its status as the political center of the Caliphate in the aftermath of Uthman&#x27;s assassination. Under Mu&#x27;awiya the capital shifted to Damascus. Although it was reduced to a provincial governorship, Medina remained a hub of Arab culture and Islamic scholarship and home of the traditional Islamic aristocracy. The old elites in Medina, including most of the Umayyad family, resented their loss of power to Mu&#x27;awiya; in the summation of the historian Julius Wellhausen, &quot;of what consequence was Marwan, formerly the all-powerful imperial chancellor of Uthman, now as Emir of Medina! No wonder he cast envious looks at his cousin of Damascus who had so far outstripped him.&quot;

During his first term, Marwan acquired from Mu&#x27;awiya a large estate in the Fadak oasis in northwestern Arabia, which he then bestowed on his sons Abd al-Malik and Abd al-Aziz. Marwan&#x27;s first dismissal from the governorship caused him to travel to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s court for an explanation from the caliph, who listed three reasons: Marwan&#x27;s refusal to confiscate for Mu&#x27;awiya the properties of their relative Abd Allah ibn Amir after the latter&#x27;s dismissal from the governorship of Basra; Marwan&#x27;s criticism of the caliph&#x27;s adoption of the fatherless Ziyad ibn Abihi, Ibn Amir&#x27;s successor in Basra, as the son of his father Abu Sufyan, which the Umayyad family disputed; and Marwan&#x27;s refusal to assist the caliph&#x27;s daughter Ramla in a domestic dispute with her husband, Amr ibn Uthman ibn Affan. In 670, Marwan led Umayyad opposition to the attempted burial of Hasan ibn Ali beside the grave of Muhammad, compelling Hasan&#x27;s brother, Husayn, and his clan, the Banu Hashim, to abandon their original funeral arrangement and bury Hasan in the al-Baqi cemetery instead. Afterward, Marwan participated in the funeral and eulogized Hasan as one &quot;whose forbearance weighed mountains&quot;.

According to Bosworth, Mu&#x27;awiya may have been suspicious of the ambitions of Marwan and the Abu al-As line of the Banu Umayya in general, which was significantly more numerous than the Abu Sufyan (Sufyanid) line to which Mu&#x27;awiya belonged. Marwan was among the eldest and most prestigious Umayyads at a time when there were few experienced Sufyanids of mature age. Bosworth speculates that it &quot;may have been fears of the family of Abu&#x27;l-ʿĀs that impelled Muʿāwiya to his adoption of his putative half-brother Ziyād b. Sumayya [Ziyad ibn Abihi] and to the unusual step of naming his own son Yazīd as heir to the caliphate during his own lifetime&quot;. Marwan had earlier pressed Uthman&#x27;s son Amr to claim the caliphate based on the legitimacy of his father, a member of the Abu al-As branch, but Amr was uninterested. Marwan reluctantly accepted Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s nomination of Yazid in 676, but quietly encouraged another son of Uthman, Sa&#x27;id, to contest the succession. Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s ambitions were neutralized when the caliph gave him military command in Khurasan, the easternmost region of the Caliphate.

==Leader of the Umayyads in Medina==

After Mu&#x27;awiya died in 680, Husayn ibn Ali, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and Abd Allah ibn Umar, all sons of prominent Qurayshite companions of Muhammad with their own claims to the caliphate, continued to refuse allegiance to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s chosen successor Yazid. Marwan, the leader of the Umayyad clan in the Hejaz, advised al-Walid ibn Utba, then governor of Medina, to coerce Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr, both of whom he considered especially dangerous to Umayyad rule, to accept the caliph&#x27;s sovereignty. Husayn answered al-Walid&#x27;s summons, but withheld his recognition of Yazid, offering instead to make the pledge in public. Al-Walid accepted, prompting Marwan, who attended the meeting, to castigate the governor and demand Husayn&#x27;s detention until he proffered the oath of allegiance to Yazid or his execution should he refuse. Husayn then cursed Marwan and left the meeting, eventually making his way toward Kufa to lead a rebellion against the Umayyads. He was slain by Yazid&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Karbala in October 680.

Meanwhile, Ibn al-Zubayr avoided al-Walid&#x27;s summons and escaped to Mecca, where he rallied opposition to Yazid from his headquarters in the Ka&#x27;aba, Islam&#x27;s holiest sanctuary where violence was traditionally banned. In the Islamic traditional anecdotes relating Yazid&#x27;s response, Marwan warns Ibn al-Zubayr not to submit to the caliph; Wellhausen considers these variable traditions to be unreliable. In 683, the people of Medina rebelled against the caliph and assaulted the local Umayyads and their supporters, prompting them to take refuge in Marwan&#x27;s houses in the city&#x27;s suburbs where they were besieged. In response to Marwan&#x27;s plea for assistance, Yazid dispatched an expeditionary force of Syrian tribesmen led by Muslim ibn Uqba to assert Umayyad authority over the region. The Umayyads of Medina were afterward expelled and many, including Marwan and the Abu al-As family, joined Ibn Uqba&#x27;s expedition. In the ensuing Battle of al-Harra in August 683, Marwan led his horsemen through Medina and launched a rear assault against the Medinese defenders fighting Ibn Uqba in the city&#x27;s eastern outskirts. Despite its victory over the Medinese, Yazid&#x27;s army retreated to Syria in the wake of the caliph&#x27;s death in November. On the Syrians&#x27; departure, Ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph and soon gained recognition in most of the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces, including Egypt, Iraq and Yemen. Marwan and the Umayyads of the Hejaz were expelled for a second time by Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s partisans and their properties were confiscated.

==Caliphate==
===Accession===

By early 684, Marwan was in Syria, either at Palmyra or in the court of Yazid&#x27;s young son and successor, Mu&#x27;awiya II, in Damascus. The latter died several weeks into his reign without designating a successor. The governors of the Syrian (military districts) of Palestine, Homs and Qinnasrin subsequently gave their allegiance to Ibn al-Zubayr. As a result, Marwan &quot;despaired over any future for the Umayyads as rulers&quot;, according to Bosworth, and was prepared to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s legitimacy. However, he was encouraged by the expelled governor of Iraq, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, to volunteer himself as Mu&#x27;awiyaII&#x27;s successor during a summit of loyalist Syrian Arab tribes being held in Jabiya. The bids for leadership of the Muslim community exposed the conflict between three developing principles of succession. The general recognition of Ibn al-Zubayr adhered to the Islamic principle of passing leadership to the most righteous and eminent Muslim, while the Umayyad loyalists at the Jabiya summit debated the two other principles: direct hereditary succession as introduced by Mu&#x27;awiyaI and represented by the nomination of his adolescent grandson Khalid ibn Yazid; and the Arab tribal norm of selecting the wisest and most capable member of a tribe&#x27;s leading clan, epitomized in this case by Marwan.

The organizer of the Jabiya summit, Ibn Bahdal, the chieftain of the powerful Banu Kalb tribe and maternal cousin of Yazid, supported Khalid&#x27;s nomination. Most of the other chieftains, led by Rawh ibn Zinba of the Judham and Husayn ibn Numayr of the Kinda, opted for Marwan, citing his mature age, political acumen and military experience, over Khalid&#x27;s youth and inexperience. The 9th-century historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi quotes Rawh heralding Marwan: &quot;People of Syria! This is Marwān b. al-Ḥakam, the chief of Quraysh, who avenged the blood of ʿUthmān and fought ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib at the Battle of the Camel and Ṣiffīn.&quot; A consensus was ultimately reached on 22 June 684 (29 Shawwal 64 AH), whereby Marwan would accede to the caliphate, followed by Khalid and then Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As, another prominent young Umayyad. In exchange for backing Marwan, the loyalist Syrian tribes, who shortly thereafter became known as the &quot;Yaman&quot; faction (see below), were promised financial compensation. The Yamani (tribal nobility) demanded from Marwan the same courtly and military privileges they held under the previous Umayyad caliphs. Husayn ibn Numayr had attempted to reach a similar arrangement with Ibn al-Zubayr, who publicly rejected the terms. In contrast, Marwan &quot;realized the importance of the Syrian troops and adhered wholeheartedly to their demands&quot;, according to the historian Mohammad Rihan. In the summation of Kennedy, &quot;Marwān had no experience or contacts in Syria; he would be entirely dependent on the from the Yamanī tribes who had elected him.&quot;

===Campaigns to reassert Umayyad rule===

In opposition to the Kalb, the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes objected to Marwan&#x27;s accession and beckoned al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, the governor of Damascus, to mobilize for war; accordingly, al-Dahhak and the Qays set up camp in the Marj Rahit plain north of Damascus. Most of the Syrian backed Ibn al-Zubayr, with the exception of Jordan, whose dominant tribe was the Kalb. With the critical support of the Kalb and its allied tribes, Marwan marched against al-Dahhak&#x27;s larger army, while in Damascus city, a Ghassanid nobleman expelled al-Dahhak&#x27;s partisans and brought the city under Marwan&#x27;s authority. In August, Marwan&#x27;s forces routed the Qays and killed al-Dahhak at the Battle of Marj Rahit. Marwan&#x27;s rise had affirmed the power of the Quda&#x27;a tribal confederation, of which the Kalb was part, and after the battle, it formed an alliance with the Qahtan confederation of Homs, forming the new super-tribe of Yaman. The crushing Umayyad–Yamani victory at Marj Rahit led to the long-running Qays–Yaman blood feud. The remnants of Qays rallied around Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, who took over the fortress of Qarqisiya (Circesium) in Upper Mesopotamia, from which he led the tribal opposition to the Umayyads. In a poem attributed to him, Marwan thanked the Yamani tribes for their support at Marj Rahit:
When I saw that the affair would be one of plunder, I made ready Ghassan and Kalb against them [the Qays],And the Saksakīs [Kindites], men who would triumph, and Ṭayyi&#x27;, who would insist on the striking of blows,And the Qayn who would come weighed down with arms, and of Tanūkh a difficult and lofty peak.[The enemy] will not seize the kingship unless by force, and if Qays approach, say, Keep away!

Although he was already recognized by the loyalist tribes at Jabiya, Marwan received ceremonial oaths of allegiance as caliph in Damascus in July or August. He wed Yazid&#x27;s widow and mother of Khalid, Umm Hashim Fakhita, thereby establishing a political link with the Sufyanids. Wellhausen viewed the marriage as an attempt by Marwan to seize the inheritance of Yazid by becoming stepfather to his sons. Marwan appointed the Ghassanid Yahya ibn Qays as the head of his (security forces) and his own &quot;mawla&quot; Abu Sahl al-Aswad as his (chamberlain).

Despite his victory at Marj Rahit and the consolidation of Umayyad power in central Syria, Marwan&#x27;s authority was not recognized in the rest of the Umayyads&#x27; former domains; with the help of Ibn Ziyad and Ibn Bahdal, Marwan undertook to restore Umayyad rule across the Caliphate with &quot;energy and determination&quot;, according to Kennedy. To Palestine he dispatched Rawh ibn Zinba, who forced the flight to Mecca of his rival for leadership of the Judham tribe, the pro-Zubayrid governor Natil ibn Qays. Marwan also consolidated Umayyad rule in northern Syria, and the remainder of his reign was marked by attempts to reassert Umayyad authority. By February/March 685, he secured his rule in Egypt with key assistance from the Arab tribal nobility of the provincial capital Fustat. The province&#x27;s pro-Zubayrid governor, Abd al-Rahman ibn Utba al-Fihri, was expelled and replaced with Marwan&#x27;s son Abd al-Aziz. Afterward, Marwan&#x27;s forces led by Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id repulsed a Zubayrid expedition against Palestine launched by Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s brother Mus&#x27;ab. Marwan dispatched an expedition to the Hejaz led by the Quda&#x27;a commander Hubaysh ibn Dulja, which was routed at al-Rabadha east of Medina. Meanwhile, Marwan sent his son Muhammad to check the Qaysi tribes in the middle Euphrates region. By early 685, he dispatched an army led by Ibn Ziyad to conquer Iraq from the Zubayrids and the pro-Alids (partisans of Caliph Ali and his household and the forerunners of the Shia sect of Islam).

===Death and succession===

After a reign of between six and ten months, depending on the source, Marwan died in the spring of 65 AH/685. The precise date of his death is not clear from the medieval sources, with historians Ibn Sa&#x27;d, al-Tabari and Khalifa ibn Khayyat placing it on 29Sha&#x27;ban/10 or 11 April, al-Mas&#x27;udi on 3Ramadan/13 April and Elijah of Nisibis on 7May. Most early Muslim sources hold that Marwan died in Damascus, while al-Mas&#x27;udi holds that he died at his winter residence in al-Sinnabra near Lake Tiberias. Although it is widely reported in the traditional Muslim sources that Marwan was killed in his sleep by Umm Hashim Fakhita in retaliation for a serious verbal insult to her honor by the caliph, most western historians dismiss the story. Based on a report by al-Mas&#x27;udi, Bosworth and others suspect Marwan succumbed to a plague afflicting Syria at the time of his death.

Upon Marwan&#x27;s return to Syria from Egypt in 685, he had designated his sons Abd al-Malik and Abd al-Aziz as his successors, in that order. He made the change after he reached al-Sinnabra and was informed that Ibn Bahdal recognized Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id as Marwan&#x27;s successor-in-waiting. He summoned and questioned Ibn Bahdal and ultimately demanded that he give allegiance to Abd al-Malik as his heir apparent. By this, Marwan abrogated the arrangement reached at the Jabiya summit in 684, re-instituting the principle of direct hereditary succession. Abd al-Malik acceded to the caliphate without opposition from the previous designates, Khalid ibn Yazid and Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id. Thereafter, hereditary succession became the standard practice of the Umayyad caliphs.

==Assessment==

By making his family the foundation of his power, Marwan modeled his administration on that of Caliph Uthman, who extensively relied on his kinsmen, as opposed to Mu&#x27;awiyaI, who largely kept them at arm&#x27;s length. To that end, Marwan ensured Abd al-Malik&#x27;s succession as caliph and gave his sons Muhammad and Abd al-Aziz key military commands. Despite the tumultuous beginnings, the &quot;Marwanids&quot; (descendants of Marwan) were established as the ruling house of the Umayyad realm.

In the view of Bosworth, Marwan &quot;was obviously a military leader and statesman of great skill and decisiveness amply endowed with the qualities of [levelheadedness] and shrewdness, which characterised other outstanding members of the Umayyad clan&quot;. His rise as caliph in Syria, a largely unfamiliar territory where he lacked a power-base, laid the foundations for Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign, which consolidated Umayyad rule for a further sixty-five years. In the view of Madelung, Marwan&#x27;s path to the caliphate was &quot;truly high politics&quot;, the culmination of intrigues dating from his early career. These included encouraging Uthman&#x27;s empowerment of the Umayyads, becoming the &quot;first avenger&quot; of Uthman&#x27;s assassination by murdering Talha, and privately undermining while publicly enforcing the authority of the Sufyanid caliphs of Damascus.

Marwan was known to be gruff and lacking in social graces. He suffered permanent injuries after a number of battle wounds. His tall and emaciated appearance lent him the nickname (gossamer-like thread). In later anti-Umayyad Muslim tradition, Marwan was derided as (outlawed son of an outlaw) in reference to his father al-Hakam&#x27;s alleged exile to Ta&#x27;if by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Marwan&#x27;s expulsion from Medina by Ibn al-Zubayr. He was also referred to as (father of tyrants) because his son and grandsons later inherited the caliphal throne. In a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad, Marwan and his father are the subject of the Islamic prophet&#x27;s foreboding, though Donner holds that much of these reports were likely conceived by Shia opponents of Marwan and the Umayyads in general.

A number of reports cited by the medieval Islamic historians al-Baladhuri () and Ibn Asakir () are indicative of Marwan&#x27;s piety, such as the 9th-century historian al-Mada&#x27;ini&#x27;s assertion that Marwan was among the best readers of the Qur&#x27;an and Marwan&#x27;s own claim to have recited the Qur&#x27;an for over forty years before the Battle of Marj Rahit. On the basis that many of his sons bore clearly Islamic names (as opposed to traditional Arabian names), Donner speculates Marwan may have indeed been &quot;deeply religious&quot; and &quot;profoundly impressed&quot; by the Qur&#x27;anic message to honor God and the prophets of Islam, including Muhammad. Donner notes the difficulty of &quot;achieving a sound assessment of Marwan&quot;, as with most Islamic leaders of his generation, due to an absence of archaeological and epigraphic documentation and the restriction of his biographical information to often polemical literary sources.

<text>Frank H. Chapman (November 1861 – December 2, 1937) was a professional baseball player who appeared in one game for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association in 1887. He was thought to have been a player named Fred Chapman and the youngest player to ever play in a Major League Baseball game until new findings by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) revealed that he was a different player, and much older, than previously believed.

==Career==
Little is known about the career of Chapman outside of his Major League appearance. According to SABR, 1887 was the only year he played professional baseball. He made appearances with a team from Hazleton in the Central Pennsylvania League and with a team from Reading in the Pennsylvania State Association; the stats he recorded for both teams are unknown. Chapman is also believed to have pitched for a team in Kingston, New York, but it is not listed in his minor league record.

His only Major League appearance took place on July 22, 1887, when the Philadelphia Athletics signed him from the Reading club to pitch in a game against the Cleveland Blues at Jefferson Street Grounds. Facing Blues starter Mike Morrison, Chapman gave up six runs in the first five innings. The game ended in unusual fashion, as Morrison declared a forfeit in the sixth inning with the Blues leading by two runs following a heated argument with an umpire. As a result, Chapman is credited with a complete game, but not a win. Overall, in his five innings of work, he gave up eight hits, four earned runs and six runs total, two walks, and four strikeouts. As a batter, he did not collect a hit in two at-bats.

==Mistaken identity==
Chapman had previously been known to baseball historians under a different name; he was originally thought to have been a player named Frederick Joseph &quot;Fred&quot; Chapman. The listed birth date for Fred Chapman was November 24, 1872, which would have made the pitcher 14 years old when he made his appearance against the Blues and would have made him the youngest player to ever pitch in a Major League Baseball game. In March 2009, SABR&#x27;s Biographical Research Committee unveiled research from member Richard Malatzky which showed that, based on data from the &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, that it was not Fred Chapman who pitched against the Blues but rather a player named Frank Chapman. Subsequent research by Malatzky, published in October 2009, revealed further information on Chapman, including information about his family and that he was from Newburgh, New York; Malatzky also found evidence that he died in Newburgh as well.

<text>The God is Love Pentecostal Church (IPDA) () is a Pentecostal trinitarian Christian denomination in Brazil. The headquarters are in São Paulo.

==History==
The Igreja Pentecostal Deus é Amor was founded in São Paulo on 3 June 1962 by David Martins de Miranda (or David Miranda). The spread of the IPDA and other pentecostal churches was encouraged by economic regression, urbanization and the emergence of the informal settlements since the 1950s, where the IPDA gained most of its new followers at this time. Among the poorest, promises of &quot;the miracle that will free them from their situation&quot;, fell on fertile grounds. By 1995 it had spread to 30 other countries, with a membership of 800,000 members in 2001 Census. As of 2003, there were 8,140 churches. In 2004, the church inaugurated the Temple of the Glory of God in São Paulo, with an auditorium of 60,000 seats.

==Beliefs==
The denomination has a Pentecostal confession of faith and its doctrine belongs to the Finished Work Pentecostalism. The organisation&#x27;s emphasis is on faith healing, deliverance ministry, laying on of hands, anointing of the sick, baptism with the Holy Spirit, signs and wonders and evangelism. The church has several radio stations, where church programs as well as live healing and deliverance services are broadcast. Compared to other Brazilian Pentecostal churches, &quot;Deus é Amor&quot; is of a fundamentalist christian ideology and separates itself from society.

==Controversies==
The IPDA has established strict control mechanisms to survey the presence of its followers. Members of the churches have to obtain &quot;faith cards&quot;, which must be stamped each day of the week to prove their presence at the worship service and the obligatorial payment to the church. The organization, together with Edir Macedo&#x27;s Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus, is accused of using the acquisition of the &quot;Edificio Cines Plaza y Central&quot; cinema in Montevideo, Uruguay as a disguise to cover up money laundering. Furthermore, the IPDA is accused to have connections to the organized crime scene of Brazil. Many former favela gang members work as pastors after their conversion.

<doc id="437317" wikidata="Q166283" url="?curid=437317" title="1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak">
<text>A deadly tornado outbreak occurred in Central Texas during the afternoon and evening of May 27, 1997, in conjunction with a southwestward-moving cluster of supercell thunderstorms. These storms produced 20 tornadoes, mainly along the Interstate 35 corridor from northeast of Waco to north of San Antonio. The strongest tornado was an F5 tornado that leveled parts of Jarrell, killing 27 people and injuring 12 others. Overall, 30 people were killed and 33 others were hospitalized by the severe weather.

Although the atmospheric conditions enabling the event were forecast to be conducive for strong winds and large hail, forecasters did not initially anticipate as much of a risk of strong tornadoes due to the lack of substantial wind shear over the region. Instead, the coalescence of several weather features—including a cold front, a dry line, and a gravity wave—provided locally favorable conditions for rotating thunderstorms and the formation of tornadoes. This peculiar evolution led to the unusual southwestward motion of the storms and the tornadoes they produced.

A tornado watch was first issued at 12:54 p.m. on May 27 for portions of East Texas and western Louisiana; the first tornado touched down at 1:21 p.m. in McLennan County while the final tornado lifted at 8:23 p.m. later that day in Frio County. The 20 tornadoes collectively inflicted at least $126.6 million in damage. The F5 Jarrell tornado was the outbreak&#x27;s most powerful and deadliest tornado. It destroyed most of the 38-home Double Creek Estates subdivision west of Jarrell where the most extreme damage occurred. Residences were completely dismantled, swept away, and reduced to concrete slabs, while trees in the area were completely shredded and debarked. Fields were scoured to a depth of and asphalt was torn from roads. Due to the tornado&#x27;s intensity, the debris was often small in size and beyond recognition. There were four other tornadoes rated F3 or higher. One F3 tornado moved across Cedar Park, damaging parts of the business district and numerous homes in nearby neighborhoods. An F4 tornado struck areas near Lake Travis and caused one fatality. In addition to the tornadoes, the storms also produced large hail and strong straight-line winds; Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio recorded a wind gust.

== Meteorological synopsis ==

=== Atmospheric setup ===

The severity of the 1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak was predicated on an unusual spatial and temporal alignment of weather features at highly localized scales. The broader environment was not particularly anomalous for the late springtime over Central and East Texas. Unlike conventional tornado outbreaks in Texas, the 1997 outbreak was not associated with a strong trough of low pressure and strong density gradients in the lower troposphere. Instead, the most prominent weather system over the central U.S. at the time was a distant upper-level low centered over Nebraska imparting little influence on atmospheric conditions over Texas.

Consequently, winds in the mid-levels of the troposphere over Texas on May 27 were weak and westerly, ranging from over North Texas to below over Central and South Texas. Winds closer to the surface were also quiescent; the average storm-relative winds within the lowest of the atmosphere as measured in Del Rio, Texas, prior to the onset of storm development was only . Further aloft at the level of the jet stream, there were two nearby wind speed maxima over northern Mexico and the central Mississippi Valley; this led to strong divergence of air over Texas. Wind shear was negligible within the lowest of the atmosphere contrary to typical tornado outbreaks.

Despite generally meager winds, the atmosphere was nonetheless thermally energetic. The combination of several days of onshore wind flow from the Gulf of Mexico and the persistence of a capping inversion aloft led to an accumulation of moist air over the state. Dew points soon exceeded within the boundary layer, representing ample moisture in the lower levels of the troposphere. Radiosondes launched from Corpus Christi and Fort Worth on the morning of May 27 detected the presence of a robust &quot;elevated mixed layer&quot; of air aloft characterized by steep lapse rates—the change of temperature with height—near the dry adiabatic lapse rate. This contributed to high convective available potential energy (CAPE) exceeding 5,500 J/kg across most of Central and East Texas, denoting a highly unstable atmosphere. In some cases CAPE was as high as 6,500 J/kg. The lack of fronts moving across Texas in the 36 hours before the tornado outbreak allowed this instability to remain and spread across much of the state.

Although these conditions were regionally conducive to the development of thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and strong winds, the potential for supercell and tornado development was not initially clear given the lack of wind shear. Other metrics and indices used to diagnose tornado potential, such as the Energy Helicity Index, storm-relative helicity, supercell composite parameter, and the significant tornado parameter, were also lower than historically observed environments featuring tornadoes. For instance, the amount of storm-relative helicity within the lowest of the atmosphere—a common measure quantifying the amount of wind shear—was measured as 70 m2/s2 at Corpus Christi and reached 117 m2/s2 according to data from the Rapid Update Cycle computer model; values below 300 m2/s2 are correlated with weak tornadoes. A study published in &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot; in 2007 described the environment as being &quot;marginally favorable for supercells and unfavorable for significant, supercellular tornadoes.&quot;

Instead, the factors that enabled the eventual tornado outbreak may have transpired at a mesoscale involving several features becoming juxtaposed over Texas. The dry line delineating the boundary between the moist maritime air mass over East Texas and the drier continental air mass farther west remained nearly stationary in the region through the morning of May 27. On the preceding evening, a mesoscale convective system developing along this dry line over eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas generated a well-defined gravity wave that traveled southwest across East Texas on the morning of May 27. Its progression was evidenced on satellite imagery as an advancing band of mid-level cumuli. A weak low-pressure area also developed along the dry line near Dallas and tracked southwest along the boundary. In the two days before May 27, a cold front associated with the upper-level low over Nebraska had swept slowly southeast across the central U.S. Prior to dawn on May 27, the front progressed across West Texas; by 7:00 a.m. on May 27, the front spanned from southeastern Oklahoma through the northwestern portion of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex southwestwards to near the Big Bend of Texas. This placed the cold front parallel and just to the west of the dry line along a northeast to southwest orientation. A swath of clear skies emerged between the two boundaries, maximizing surface heating during the daytime and contributing to the weak low-pressure area&#x27;s southwestward movement through Central Texas.

=== Development of storms ===

At around 12:30 p.m., the gravity wave, cold front, dry line, and low-pressure area overlapped near Waco, Texas, with the faster cold front overtaking and merging with the nearly stationary dry line. The cold front and dry line were brought together in a northeast to southwest fashion resembling a zipper. Thunderstorms formed near Waco in tandem with this juxtaposition of features and within a local maximum of surface heating and convergence of moist air. While some storms had spawned along the cold front, the gravity wave&#x27;s passage in the early afternoon hours coincided with a rapid intensification of the first thunderstorms. The arrival of the gravity wave and its perpendicular alignment relative to the orientation of the cold front and dry line may have enhanced wind shear locally despite weak wind shear at a broader, synoptic scale. This allowed the thunderstorms to rotate and become supercells.

However, the degree to which the wave contributed to the formation of supercells and eventually tornadoes remains a subject of disagreement among meteorologists. The development of new discrete supercells followed the advancing intersection of the cold front and dry line and the gravity wave as they continued southwest, though each individual storm was nearly stationary. Due to the westerly winds in the mid-levels of the troposphere, the outflow from each developing storm was directed east, allowing each new thunderstorm to develop and rotate without interference from the initial storms. The direction of the storms&#x27; expansion towards the southwest deviated over 100 degrees away from these westerly winds, representing an extreme and highly unusual motion. The southwestward generation of storms brought them towards increasingly unstable air with higher CAPE, allowing the storms to acquire strong inflow and the requisite rotation to produce tornadoes.

There were at least three families of thunderstorms that developed as part of the initial southwestward-moving complex of storms, composed of at least 16 distinct supercells; six of the cells formed along the cold front, five formed along the dry line, and five formed along the gust front imparted by previous storms. The gust fronts pushed outwards by the downdrafts of the thunderstorms served as foci for tornadogenesis; boundaries like gust fronts can provide low-level vorticity and rising air necessary for the formation of tornadoes. Some of the day&#x27;s tornadoes were spun up by the gust front itself while others spawned from thunderstorms with preexisting mesocyclones aloft enhanced by the gust front underneath.

The day&#x27;s first thunderstorm near Waco in McLennan County strengthened quickly in response to the highly unstable atmosphere. A severe thunderstorm warning—the first of the day—was issued for the county at 12:50 p.m. Weather radars showed increasing rotation within the storm, prompting the issuance of a tornado warning at 1:21 p.m. This storm produced the outbreak&#x27;s first tornado southwest of Hewitt near Lorena. The same storm produced a second brief tornado near Bruceville followed by a third, intense F3 tornado in southwestern McLennan County that lasted for 20 minutes. A new thunderstorm developed along the flanking line associated with the first storm. This second storm spawned several tornadoes as it expanded towards the southwest, including an F3 tornado near Lake Belton beginning at 2:25 p.m. and the F5 Jarrell tornado beginning at 3:25 p.m. The NEXRAD radar in Granger used to monitor this storm suffered a power failure and went out of commission at 3:38 p.m. A control switch left in an improper position on a prior maintenance visit prevented its emergency power supply from activating. Thunderstorms developing to the southwest later in the afternoon and evening produced additional tornadoes, including the F3 tornado that struck Cedar Park and the F4 tornado that struck Lakeway. The Lakeway tornado was the first instance of an F4 tornado striking Travis County on record. The final tornado of the day touched down in Frio County and lifted at 7:23 p.m.

Farther south away from the southwestward-moving storm cluster, the cold front and dry line curved west, making them parallel to the advancing gravity wave; this triggered the development of numerous and intense storms between Austin and the Big Bend after 3:00 p.m. when the gravity wave intersected the front. The parallel orientations of the wave and the other boundaries precluded these storms&#x27; rotation. They tracked east and eventually merged with the southwestward-propagating complex of tornadic storms along the Pedernales River. This coalescence produced a south- and southeastward-moving squall line and ended the strong tornado activity. Nonetheless, strong and damaging winds were produced by the squall line for several hours. Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio documented a wind gust of , marking a record high wind velocity for the site.

== Warnings and preparedness ==
The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) forecasted a &quot;moderate risk&quot; for severe thunderstorms over parts of East Texas in its severe weather outlook issued at 1:03 a.m. on May 27. The moderate risk region included Waco, the Killeen–Temple–Fort Hood metropolitan area, and extended east towards Shreveport, Louisiana, and Fort Polk, Louisiana. Austin was located at the boundary between the moderate risk region and the slight risk region that encompassed most of East and South Texas, including the Hill Country. The SPC predicted that the gravity wave would be a focal point for storms capable of producing large hail and damaging winds given the unstable atmosphere. A subsequent outlook issued by the SPC at 10:16 a.m. continued to indicate a moderate risk for severe weather and mentioned the possibility of isolated and brief tornadoes. A tornado watch was later issued by the SPC at 12:54 p.m. for parts of eastern Texas and western Louisiana, citing the unstable airmass in place over the region. The Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin/San Antonio National Weather Service forecast offices also issued bulletins on the morning of May 27 noting the potential for severe weather. However, these early outlooks focused more on the threat of wind and hail rather than tornadoes due to the low wind shear present over the region.

The Dallas/Fort Worth National Weather Service forecast office ultimately issued 10 tornado warnings and 5 severe thunderstorm warnings between 1 and 5 p.m. on May 27. The Austin/San Antonio office issued 8 tornado warnings, 24 severe thunderstorm warnings, and 10 flash flood warnings during the afternoon and evening of May 27, with 80 percent of their issued products occurring after 5 p.m. in connection with the widespread storms that developed later in the day separate from the initial tornadic storms. In one case, a media outlet&#x27;s decision to manually activate the Emergency Alert System rather than allow weather warnings to automatically trigger it resulted in a 25–30 minute delay in the dissemination of a warning. Interviews conducted by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration service assessment team found that many watched the approach of tornadoes prior to taking shelter due to their slow movement and high visibility. In the case of the F5 Jarrell tornado, some fled while others took shelter. Due to the strength of the tornado, some who stayed behind were killed despite taking appropriate safety measures.

==Confirmed tornadoes==


===Jarrell, Texas===
Parts of Jarrell, Texas, were struck by an extremely powerful F5 tornado on the afternoon of May 27. The tornado destroyed approximately 10 percent of the homes in Jarrell; at the time, the city had a population of about 450 people and had been previously struck by tornadoes in 1987 and 1989. Hardest-hit was the Double Creek Estates subdivision west of downtown Jarrell. The 1997 Jarrell tornado was the first and only known occurrence of an F5 tornado in Williamson County. It was also the deadliest tornado in Texas since the 1987 Saragosa tornado. The thunderstorm that spawned the Jarrell tornado began west of Temple along the flanking line of another thunderstorm earlier in the afternoon of May 27. The storm produced several tornadoes in Bell County, including the F3 tornado that impacted communities along Lake Belton. Weather radar observed a strengthening mesocyclone within the thunderstorm, with the speed of rotation rising above . As the storm moved into Williamson County, it produced two short-lived F2 tornadoes north of Jarrell at 3:25 p.m. and 3:35 p.m.; the latter of the two was a multiple-vortex tornado and lifted at 3:39 p.m. The Austin/San Antonio National Weather Service forecast office issued a tornado warning for Williamson County at 3:30 p.m. in response to the storm&#x27;s approach; the warning was put into effect for one hour. This was the first tornado warning of the day issued for the office&#x27;s warning area and warned that &quot;the city of Jarrell is in the path of this storm.&quot; Local warning sirens went off about 10–12 minutes before the tornado struck.

The precise start of the Jarrell tornado was difficult to pinpoint. The most prominent and destructive part of the tornado&#x27;s evolution was preceded by the apparition of short-lived, small, and rope-like funnel clouds. These may have been separate tornadoes or simply an earlier part of the Jarrell tornado&#x27;s evolution. An aerial survey conducted by the Birmingham, Alabama, office of the National Weather Service included the damage caused by the earlier F2 tornadoes—mostly to trees and roads—as part of the overall Jarrell tornado path. Some reports also include the F1 tornado near Prairie Dell as an earlier continuation of the Jarrell tornado. The final, unambiguous apparition of the Jarrell tornado began within the Williamson County line north of Jarrell as a narrow and rope-shaped funnel swathed in large amounts of dust when it touched down at 3:40 p.m. Like the two F3 tornadoes earlier in the day, it developed along the gust front produced by its parent thunderstorm. This mechanism is typical of tornadogenesis not associated with supercell thunderstorms. Traffic along Interstate 35 came to a stop as the tornado descended nearby. The Texas Highway Patrol also stopped traffic on both sides of the interstate under the expectation that the tornado would cross the highway; it ultimately moved parallel to Interstate 35. Tracking south-southwest, the tornado quickly intensified and grew to a in width, changing from its initial thin and white appearance to a blue and black color. F5 tornado damage was identified early in the tornado&#x27;s path. Its intense winds scoured the ground and stripped pavement from roads. The tornado tore of asphalt as it crossed County Roads 308, 305, and 307; the thickness of the asphalt pavement was roughly . A culvert plant at the corner of Country Roads 305 and 307 collapsed. Nearby, a similar plant and a mobile home sustained some damage, with the latter struck by a 2×4 piece of lumber. The occupants of a mobile home north-northwest of the culvert plant fled to a frame house that the tornado later struck; the evacuees were killed while the mobile home sustained only minor damage. Some of the most extreme damage at this location was inflicted to a small metal-framed recycling plant that was obliterated, with little left of the structure besides a few twisted structural beams.
The tornado then slowly entered the Double Creek Estates subdivision where it exacted its most catastrophic impacts. Concurrently, the tornado expanded further to its maximum width of . Eyewitnesses indicated that the tornado&#x27;s movement slowed to around as it entered the neighborhood; this may have contributed to the resulting extreme destruction. The tornado destroyed the first home it encountered at the northwestern corner of the subdivision; a clock recovered from the remaining debris was stopped at 3:48 p.m., presumably marking the time the tornado entered the community. Much of the neighborhood was completely swept away with little debris remaining, with what was left being reduced to small and unrecognizable fragments that were dispersed over a wide area. The lack of large items that were recovered, and the granularity of the debris was indicative of the sheer strength of the tornado. Due to the tornado&#x27;s slow movement, homes near the center of its path experienced tornadic winds for approximately three minutes. The mostly wooden-framed residences, some well-built and anchored, were completely obliterated and swept away, leaving behind concrete slab foundations swept clean of all debris. In some cases, parts of outbuilding and house foundations themselves in the subdivision were scoured away, and several were found missing all of their sill plates that connected the wood-frame homes to the foundations. Pieces of debris were found deposited in fields miles away from the subdivision, and extreme ground scouring occurred, reducing grassy fields into wide expanses of mud in the most severely affected areas. In some cases the ground was scoured out to a depth of . Vehicles in the neighborhood were tossed and mangled beyond recognition; at least six were found flattened in open areas and coated with mud and grass. Some were thrown as far as a away, and others were torn into multiple pieces of unrecognizable metal. Trees in the neighborhood were completely denuded and stripped entirely clean of all bark as well, including one that was found with an electrical cord impaled through the trunk.

All 27 fatalities associated with the Jarrell tornado occurred at Double Creek Estates, which at the time consisted of 131 residents living in 38 single-family homes and several mobile homes. Entire families were killed at Double Creek, including all five members of the Igo Family, all four members of the Moehring family, and all three members of the Smith family. Bodily remains were later found at 30 locations, and the physical trauma inflicted to some of the tornado victims was so extreme, that first responders reportedly had difficulty distinguishing human remains from the remains of animals at the site. Most of the deaths were attributed in the &quot;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&quot; to multiple trauma, though one death was attributed to asphyxia. The high intensity of the Jarrell tornado left those in its path with little recourse; most homes in Double Creek Estates were built on cement slab foundations and few had a basement or any form of storm shelter; nineteen people sought refuge in a single storm cellar. Some residents who followed prescribed safety measures nonetheless perished. One survivor holed up in a bathtub and was flung several hundred feet from her house onto a road. The walls of some homes along the periphery of the tornado path remained intact, protecting some of those who survived the tornado. Others chose to evacuate ahead of the approaching tornado. Forty structures were obliterated in Double Creek Estates. Three businesses adjacent to Double Creek Estates were also destroyed. In total, the tornado dealt $10–20 million in damage to the neighborhood. Around 300 cattle grazing in a nearby pasture were killed and some were found away. Hundreds of cattle were also dismembered and a few cows were also skinned by the tornado.

The tornado turned slightly towards the south-southwest after traversing Double Creek Estates. The damage in these outlying areas was somewhat scattershot; in one case, a mobile home suffered only minor damage while an adjacent house lost half of its roof. Metal buildings were unroofed along County Road 305 south of Jarrell. The road&#x27;s guardrail was impaled by wooden planks thrown by the strong winds. The tornado then again crossed County Road 305 and entered a forest of cedar trees. Some of the damage to the trees suggested that the tornado may have been a multiple-vortex tornado, which was documented by Scott Beckwith, receiving a nickname as a “dead man walking”. Shortly after entering this forested area, the path of damage left behind by the tornado ended abruptly, with the National Centers for Environmental Information indicating that it lifted at 3:53 p.m. after remaining on the ground for 13 minutes and . Other government accounts of the tornado list a total path length of after incorporating the preceding tornadoes north of Jarrell and near Prairie Dell. Between May 29 and June 1, the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research carried out aerial and ground surveys of the tornadic damage in Texas in coordination with the Texas Wing Civil Air Patrol. The Jarrell tornado damage was classified as F5 severity throughout most of the tornado&#x27;s path. However, a critique of the Fujita scale published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology suggested that winds between , corresponding to an F3 rating on the scale, were sufficient to explain the damage wrought by the Jarrell tornado. The critique noted that some of the homes at Double Creek Estates, although built within the preceding 15 years, exhibited structural weaknesses in their design such as the lack of anchor bolts and steel straps in their foundations. Approximately $40 million in damage was inflicted upon property with another $100,000 inflicted upon crops. Twelve people were injured by the storm in addition to the twenty-seven killed.

Due to the unusual southwestward motion of the thunderstorm that caused the tornado, the sequence of weather events experienced by those affected was in the opposite order of typical tornadic events: the tornado arrived first, followed by the hail, wind, and rain of the parent thunderstorm. Despite the violence of the tornado and the presence of its associated mesocyclone aloft, the thunderstorm did not exhibit a distinct hook echo on weather radar typically associated with such tornadoes. This may have also been caused by the unusual southwestward motion of the thunderstorm, resulting in the tornado&#x27;s placement in an atypical position relative to the thunderstorm&#x27;s motion.

== Non-tornadic effects ==
In addition to the tornadoes, there were 12 reports of large hail in Central Texas received by the National Weather Service during the late afternoon and evening. The largest hail—measuring nearly in diameter—was recorded in Cedar Park in conjunction with the F3 tornado that hit the city. Damaging hail was also reported in Georgetown beginning at 3:55 p.m. Severe thunderstorms also generated damaging straight-line winds across the Hill Country and South-Central Texas. Much of these winds were associated with the eventual, non-tornadic line of storms that resulted from the coalescence of the day&#x27;s earlier storms. Wind gusts ranging between were recorded in Austin, with the peak wind gust occurring at Robert Mueller Municipal Airport at 4:20 p.m. There were also unofficial reports of winds reaching as high as to the west of Austin near Lake Travis. Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio registered a gust of at 8:03 p.m. Gusts reached in Del Rio and overturned a plane at an airport near Seguin. The storms knocked out power to 60,000 electricity customers in Austin and as many as 21,000 electricity customers serviced by Texas Utilities. Telephone service for more than 3,000 residents in the Pedernales Valley was disrupted. The thunderstorms also produced heavy rain that triggered floods in Blanco, Gonzales, Karnes, and Travis counties. An official rainfall total of was documented in Austin, though of rain fell in nearby Round Rock. The rains caused Brushy Creek to flood beyond its banks as far east as Thorndale. One person drowned in floodwaters along Shoal Creek in Austin. Another person died in Cedar Park of cardiac arrest likely induced by storm-related stress. The Southwestern Insurance Information Service estimated that the totality of the storms&#x27; effects inflicted $25–40 million in insured losses; most insured claims originated from Cedar Park.

== Aftermath ==

Law enforcement officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety, four municipal police departments, and two county sheriff&#x27;s offices aided search-and-rescue efforts in the aftermath of the Jarrell tornado. The Texas National Guard and other volunteers from around Central Texas joined in the search. The Scott &amp; White Blood Center facilitated blood donations. A temporary shelter was established by the American Red Cross at Jarrell High School for those displaced by the tornado, providing food and accepting clothes donations. The agency&#x27;s relief operations, covering residents of 211 homes, cost an estimated $250,000; community donations covered at least $200,000 of the expenses. The Jarrell Volunteer Fire Department organized a temporary morgue; the deceased were later brought to the Travis County Forensic Center for identification. Although a death toll of 30 people was initially reported, that figure was later revised to 27; the inflated count was attributed to the dispersion of remains that led some fatalities to be tallied twice. Carcasses of livestock were buried at Double Creek Estates.

Texas Governor George W. Bush declared Williamson County a disaster area; Bush visited Jarrell on May 28 and described the tornadic damage as the worst he had ever witnessed. U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison also visited Jarrell and Cedar Park. Bush later requested federal aid for Williamson and Bell counties with support from Hutchinson. The Federal Emergency Management Agency elected not to provide federal aid, citing the contributions from private and state sources. Instead, the Small Business Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture made available loans for the rebuilding of homes, farms, and ranches. The U.S. Congress approved a relief bill allocating $5.4 billion for 35 states affected by natural disasters, including Texas. However, the bill also included other provisions that led President Bill Clinton to veto the bill. A drive-through donation line was established at Auditorium Shores in Austin. Local musicians organized and performed at a benefit concert at Austin Music Hall, attracting an audience of 2,800 and raising about $94,000. Businesses also donated to the relief efforts.

First responders representing Cedar Park, Austin, Leander, Round Rock, and Williamson and Travis counties arrived in Cedar Park shortly after the city was hit by a tornado. Texas A&amp;M University supplied equipment for search-and-rescue operations in the aftermath of the Cedar Park tornado. These operations were the first test of the 186-member Texas Urban Search and Rescue Team, which was created following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Vouchers were distributed by the American Red Cross to storm victims in the Buttercup Creek subdivision for clothing, food, and other supplies. Texas State Troopers blocked areas of Buttercup Creek to prevent looting.

A memorial was erected in downtown Jarrell bearing the names of the 27 people killed by the Jarrell tornado. The Jarrell Memorial Park was established near Double Creek Estates on the land of the former Igo family, who perished in the tornado. The park contains 27 trees planted in honor of the victims. In 2019, the memorial was relocated to the park along with the city&#x27;s historical marker. The events and survivor accounts of the tornado were profiled in television documentaries such as the 1999 episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;America Undercover&quot; series titled &quot;Fatal Twisters: A Season of Fury&quot;, the 1999 BBC television series titled &quot;Twister Week&quot; (also known as &quot;Tornado Diary&quot; in the United States) in an episode titled &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;, the seventh episode of the Discovery Channel program &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, produced by GRB Entertainment, and the 2006 documentary &quot;Ultimate Disaster&quot; (also known as &quot;Mega Disaster&quot;) on National Geographic Channel.

<text>Ortigas Center is a central business district located within the joint boundaries of Pasig, Mandaluyong and Quezon City, within the Metro Manila region in the Philippines. With an area of more than , it is Metro Manila&#x27;s second most important business district after Makati Central Business District. It is governed by Ortigas Center Association, Inc.

Ortigas Center is home to many shopping malls, office and condominium skyscrapers, nightlife bars, restaurants and other building complexes. These include the St. Francis Square, the Asian Development Bank compound, the Oakwood Premier serviced apartments and a Shangri-La hotel. It is also home to the headquarters of San Miguel Corporation, Jollibee Foods Corporation, Viva Communications, Century Pacific Food, and Rebisco. Also present in the area are Philippine offices of prominent engineering firms such as Parsons Brinckerhoff, Sinclair Knight Merz, and WSP Group.

It is also home to the Banco de Oro main office owned by mall tycoon Henry Sy, Sr., as is the SM Megamall he owns—one of the largest malls in the nation—along EDSA. Also located near the Ortigas Center is The Medical City, one of the three hospitals in the nation accredited by the Joint Commission on International Accreditation. Ortigas Center is surrounded by Ortigas Avenue to the north, EDSA to the west, Meralco Avenue to the east, and Shaw Boulevard to the south.

==History==
Ortigas Center began as the &quot;Hacienda de Mandaloyon&quot; (also known as &quot;Mandaloyen,&quot; &quot;Mandaloyong,&quot; or &quot;Mandaloya&quot;), an estate from the Augustinian Order that spanned the present-day cities of San Juan, Mandaluyong, Quezon City, and Pasig. On January 20, 1920, the Augustinian friars sold this property to Dr. Frank W. Dudley and Don Francisco Ortigas. Dudley later surrendered his interest to Phil C. Whitaker, and the company became known as Whitaker and Ortigas. In the following years, there were several changes of partners. Then, on July 10, 1931, the company was incorporated as &quot;Ortigas, Madrigal y cia., S. en C.&quot; as a limited partnership by shares (). The parties to the partnership were Francisco Ortigas (Don Paco), Vicente Madrigal, B.C.M. Johnston, Fulgencio Borromeo, Clyde A. Dewitt and future President Manuel L. Quezon.

When Ortigas &amp; Company acquired the estate, it was a virtual wasteland. The vision of the management, headed by Atty. Francisco Ortigas Jr., who was president and chairman at that time, turned it into a progressive industrial, commercial and residential urban complex.

It would only take until the 1960s for development to begin in the district with the building of the first structures.

<text>Julio Acosta García (23 May 1872 – 6 July 1954) served as 24th President of Costa Rica from 1920 to 1924.

==Early life==
Rafael Julio del Rosario Acosta García was born on 23 May 1872 in San Ramón, Alajuela, Costa Rica to Jesús de la Rosa García Zumbado and Juan Vicente Acosta Chaves. His family was of Spanish heritage, and he had eight brothers: Aquiles, Máximo, Emilio, Raúl, Ulises, Luis, Ricardo and Horacio. By the time Acosta was born, his family had relocated from San José to San Ramón, where his father and three of his uncles operated the Three Brothers Mine () and operated a farm. His mother, known as Jesusita, was from a family of clergymen.

Acosta began his education in San José and started his secondary education at the University Institute of San José, a preparatory school run by Juan Fernández Ferraz. He completed his secondary schooling at the Colegio de San Luis Gonzaga in Cartago. He was fascinated by politics from a young age and became involved in several youth political movements in his twenties in which several radicals were arrested. Returning to Alajuela, he took a job at a banana plantation and served on the school board, before entering politics.

==Beginning career==
Between 1902 and 1906 Acosta served as an elected delegate for the Alajuela Province to the Constitutional Congress. In 1907, he was sent to El Salvador to serve as Consul-General. In April 1910, he married María Natalia Elena Gallegos Rosales in San Salvador and within two years had been appointed as the resident minister in El Salvador. In mid-1915, Acosta was recalled to Costa Rica and appointed to serve in the office of Secretary of State for the Office of Foreign Relations, Justice, Grace, and Worship.

One of the issues which concerned Acosta was a border dispute with Panama, which had long been pending. The dispute had arisen in 1910, when after Panama was separated from Gran Colombia the boundary with Costa Rica required clarification. The two parties entered into an agreement that arbiters would decide the boundary. On the Atlantic Coast, the French arbiter had given territory from Costa Rica to Panama and both sides accepted the ruling. On the Pacific Coast, the arbiter required Panama to cede territory to Costa Rica. Panama protested the ruling and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Edward Douglass White issued the &quot;White Ruling&quot; in 1914, which reaffirmed the territory on the Pacific was to be ceded to Costa Rica. Still unresolved, Acosta proposed in 1916 that the United States occupy the disputed territory to allow engineers from each country to survey the boundary and develop a resolution. During his tenure as foreign minister, Acosta traveled frequently. He was the first Minister to make official visits to all the countries of Central America.

On 27 January 1917, Acosta lost his post as minister when the brothers Federico Tinoco and Joaquín Tinoco led a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow the government. He and his family fled to his wife&#x27;s parents farm, &quot;La Esperanza&quot;, where Acosta worked as a farm manager. He also soon found work in the editorial office of the &quot;Diario del Salvador&quot; newspaper, writing about the unrest in Costa Rica. After Tinoco was forced to resign in 1919 and the temporary president Juan Bautista Quirós Segura ceded power to interim president Francisco Aguilar Barquero, Acosta was invited to return to Costa Rica. He became a candidate for president on 8 September 1919, when the Constitutional Party selected him as their representative. Elected with 89% of the vote on 7 December, he took office officially on 8 May 1920 as the 24th President of Costa Rica.

==Presidency==
Acosta was a Progressive president and set about almost immediately to roll back the repressive anticlerical and dictatorial policies of Tinoco, making promises to reform electoral processes, reform border disputes and operate a government without the corruption or squandering the public trust. He favored giving women the vote, established a pension program for veterans, proposed renegotiation of debts to stabilize the currency, and normalized the relationship of the state with Pope Benedict XV. During his administration, the Costa Rican Academy of Language, the Central Bank of Costa Rica, and an international cablegram service were established. Legislation was also introduced to protect minors, regulate gaming, reform insurance, create the Police Corps, establish pedagogical training, develop school inspection and teacher pension programs, and establish free and compulsory education for all children aged 8 to 15. Creating the Public Health Board, Acosta&#x27;s administration also expanded the Medical Board to include regulations for homeopathy and osteopathy, as well as public assistance for the medical needs of the poor.

Acosta requested membership in the League of Nations to improve the country&#x27;s international diplomacy, which was granted on 20 January 1921. Regionally, he proposed a pact that would create the Federal Republic of Central America. Because of on-going disputes with Nicaragua and Panama, the members of the proposed union were to be Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Though the legislatures of the other three countries approved a federation, the Costa Rican congress rejected the proposal.
In February 1921 the border dispute with Panama reemerged, when rumors of Panamanian expansion into the disputed territory caused Acosta to send an expeditionary force to evaluate what was going on. Panama&#x27;s response to the entrance of troops into the disputed territory resulted in their request for protection from the United States. The celebrations for the centennial of Panama&#x27;s liberation from Spain sparked nationalist feeling in Panama, and, fueled by the press, the border dispute quickly moved from a diplomatic conflict to a military one. The lasted from 21 February to 5 March 1921, with Costa Rica invading Panamanian territory in the Almirante and Bocas del Toro Districts and Panama&#x27;s forces invading the Puntarenas Province of Costa Rica. The United States sent warships enroute and the League of Nations urged peaceful solutions. Diplomatic discussion followed, but delays on the Panamanian side forced the American arbiter to demand a withdrawal of Panama from the Coto Region on 23 August, ending the matter.

==Later career==
Acosta&#x27;s last message to Congress was made on 1 May 1924. He and his family moved to Paris for three years where he worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Returning to Costa Rica in 1927, he continued to work with the Red Cross until 1929, when he was appointed as a member to the Mortgage Credit Board. In 1932, he was elected as a deputy for San José for the Constitutional Congress, serving from 1932 to 1936. Appointed to the Board of the National Bank of Costa Rica, he served until 1938, when he was again elected as a deputy for Congress. When his term ended in 1942, Acosta became the manager of the Social Security Fund and the following February assumed the presidency of the National Civil Defense Board. In 1944, he was reappointed to the post of Foreign Minister for the Office of the Secretary of State. During that time, he served as Costa Rica&#x27;s signatory in the 1945 convention in San Francisco for the signing of the United Nations Charter. In May 1947, Acosta suffered a stroke and had to withdraw from his office.

==Death and legacy==
Acosta died on 6 July 1954 in San José and was buried in the General Cemetery after an official funeral. In addition to the numerous honors he received during his life, there are several schools named in his honor in Costa Rica. A monument was erected in his memory in Parque Morazán in San José.

<text>The Two Noble Kinsmen is a Jacobean tragicomedy, first published in 1634 and attributed jointly to John Fletcher and William Shakespeare. Its plot derives from &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1387–1400), which had already been dramatised at least twice before, and itself was a shortened version of Boccaccio&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Teseida&quot;. This play is believed to have been originally performed in 1613–1614, making it William Shakespeare&#x27;s final play before he retired to Stratford-upon-Avon, where he died in 1616.

Formerly a point of controversy, the dual attribution is now generally accepted by scholarly consensus.

==Synopsis==

A prologue informs the audience that the play is based on a story from Chaucer.

Three queens come to plead with Theseus and Hippolyta, rulers of Athens, to avenge the deaths of their husbands by the hand of the tyrant Creon of Thebes. Creon has killed the three kings and refuses to allow them proper burial. Theseus agrees to wage war on Creon.

In Thebes, Palamon and Arcite, cousins and close friends, are bound by duty to fight for Creon, though they are appalled by his tyranny. In a hard-fought battle Palamon and Arcite enact prodigies of courage, but the Thebans are defeated by Theseus. Palamon and Arcite are imprisoned but philosophically resign themselves to their fate. Their stoicism is instantly destroyed when from their prison window they see Princess Emilia, Hippolyta&#x27;s sister. Both fall in love with her, and their friendship turns to bitter rivalry. Arcite is released after a relative intercedes on his behalf. He is banished from Athens, but he disguises himself, wins a local wrestling match, and is appointed as Emilia&#x27;s bodyguard.

Meanwhile, the jailer&#x27;s daughter has fallen in love with Palamon and helps him escape. She follows him, but he ignores her since he is still obsessed with Emilia. He lives in the forest half-starved, where he meets Arcite. The two argue, but Arcite offers to bring Palamon food, drink and armaments so that they can meet in an equal fight over Emilia.

The jailer&#x27;s daughter, forsaken, has gone mad. She sings and babbles in the forest. She meets a troupe of local countrymen who want to perform a Morris dance before the king and queen. The local schoolmaster Gerald invites the mad daughter to join the performance. Theseus and Hippolyta appear hunting. Gerald hails them, and they agree to watch the yokels perform a bizarre act for them, with the jailer&#x27;s mad daughter dancing. The royal couple reward them.

Arcite returns with the food and weapons. After a convivial dinner with reminiscences, the two fight. Theseus and his entourage arrive on the scene. He orders for Palamon and Arcite to be arrested and executed. Hippolyta and Emilia intervene and so Theseus agrees to a public tournament between the two for Emilia&#x27;s hand. Each warrior will be allowed three companions to assist them. The loser and his companion knights will be executed.

The jailer finds his daughter with the help of friends. He tries to restore her mental health. On the advice of a doctor, he encourages her former suitor to pretend to be Palamon so that she will be gradually accustomed to see him as her true love. His devotion slowly wins her over.

Before the tournament, Arcite prays to Mars that he win the battle, Palamon prays to Venus that he marry Emilia and Emilia prays to Diana that she be wed to the one who loves her best. Each prayer is granted: Arcite wins the combat but is then thrown from his horse and dies, leaving Palamon to wed Emilia.

==Sources==
Before the composition of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;—itself based on Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Teseida&quot;—had been adapted for the stage twice before, although both versions are now lost. The first was by Richard Edwardes in &quot;Palamon and Arcite&quot; (1566). This play was commissioned for a one-off performance before Queen Elizabeth in Oxford. It was never published, and it is unlikely to have served as a basis for &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;.

Another play on the topic, the authorship of which is not known, would certainly have been known to Shakespeare and Fletcher. It was performed by the Admiral&#x27;s Men in September 1594, which had then recently been formed after a split in Shakespeare&#x27;s own company. Philip Henslowe commissioned the play, which may have influenced Shakespeare&#x27;s own &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which is usually considered to have been written around this time.

The comic sub-plot involving the jailer&#x27;s daughter has no direct source, but is similar to scenes in &quot;The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn&quot; (1613), by Francis Beaumont, from which the performance by the yokels is derived. The Schoolmaster who organises it recalls Rombus in Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s one-act play &quot;The Lady of May&quot; (1579?). In other respects, he resembles Peter Quince in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Date and text==
Links between &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; and contemporaneous works point to 1613–1614 as its date of composition and first performance. A reference to Palamon, one of the protagonists of &quot;Kinsmen,&quot; is contained in Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; (1614). In Jonson&#x27;s work, a passage in appears to indicate that &quot;Kinsmen&quot; was known and familiar to audiences at that time.

In Francis Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn&quot; (1613), the second anti-masque features this cast of rural characters: pedant, May Lord and Lady, servingman and chambermaid, tavern host and hostess, shepherd and his wench, and two &quot;bavians&quot; (male and female baboon). The same cast slightly simplified (minus wench and one &quot;bavian&quot;) enacts the Morris dance in &quot;Kinsmen,&quot; A successful &quot;special effect&quot; in Beaumont&#x27;s masque, designed for a single performance, appears to have been adopted and adapted into &quot;Kinsmen&quot;, indicating that the play followed soon after the masque.

The play was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 8 April 1634; the quarto was published later that year by the bookseller John Waterson, printed by Thomas Cotes. The play was not included in the First Folio (1623) or any of the subsequent Folios of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, though it was included in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679.

In September 2020, media reported that early seventeenth-century editions of several English plays, including a 1634 &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; had been discovered by John Stone of the University of Barcelona at the Royal Scots College&#x27;s library in Salamanca, Spain. The inclusion of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; in one of these two volumes makes it perhaps the oldest copy of any of Shakespeare&#x27;s works in the country and the first to circulate in the Spanish-speaking world.

==Shakespeare and Fletcher contributions==
Researchers have applied a range of tests and techniques to determine the relative shares of Shakespeare and Fletcher in the play in their attempts to distinguish the shares of Shakespeare and Fletcher. For example, Smith (1974) cites &quot;metrical characteristics, vocabulary and word-compounding, incidence of certain contractions, kinds and uses of imagery, and characteristic lines of certain types&quot;, and offers a breakdown that agrees, in general if not in all details, with those of other scholars:

;Shakespeare: Act I, scenes 1–3; Act II, scene 1; Act III, scene 1; Act V, scene 1, lines 34–173, and scenes 3 and 4.
;Fletcher: Prologue; Act II, scenes 2–6; Act III, scenes 2–6; Act IV, scenes 1 and 3; Act V, scene 1, lines 1–33, and scene 2; Epilogue.
;Uncertain: Act I, scenes 4 and 5; Act IV, scene 2.

==Performance history==
In addition to whatever public performances there were around 1613–1614, evidence suggests a performance of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; at Court in 1619. In 1664, after theatres had re-opened after Charles II returned to the throne at the beginning of the English Restoration period, Sir William Davenant produced an adaptation of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; for the Duke&#x27;s Company titled &quot;The Rivals&quot;. Thomas Betterton played the role of Philander, Davenant&#x27;s version of Palamon. Samuel Pepys saw Davenant&#x27;s production, and judged it &quot;no excellent play, but good acting in it&quot; (10 September 1664).

=== Modern revivals ===

A production was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Swan Theatre&#x27;s inaugural season in 1986. In 2016, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a version of the play at the Swan Theatre, and the play was part of the 2018 summer season at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre in London. 

In July 2007, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged a version of the play as part of its annual Shakespeare in the Parks series. Director David Sewell set the production in ancient Greece with an ethnically diverse cast reflective of its Mediterranean setting.

A production opened on 9 June 2015 at the White Bear Theatre in Vauxhall, London—the first London production of the play since 2000. 

In 2019, The Porters of Hellsgate in Los Angeles staged a production in a rep with &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;. The production, directed by Will Block, re-purposed the Morris Dance as a hallucination featuring major characters from the Jailer&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s life. It also excised Palamon and Arcite&#x27;s prayers, focusing the scene instead on Emilia&#x27;s dilemma.

January 25th February 4th 2024 the Toronto based Shakespeare Bash&#x27;d Theatre Company staged this play in Toronto at The Theatre Centre Incubator (1115 Queen St West).
