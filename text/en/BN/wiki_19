<text>Inca Kola (also known as &quot;Golden Kola&quot; in international advertising) is a soft drink that was created in Peru in 1935 by British immigrant Joseph Robinson Lindley. The soda has a sweet, fruity flavor that somewhat resembles its main ingredient, lemon verbena (not to be confused with lemongrass, both of which can be known as &quot;hierbaluisa&quot; in Spanish). Americans compare its flavor to bubblegum or cream soda, and it is sometimes categorized as a champagne cola.

The Coca-Cola Company owns the Inca Kola trademark everywhere but in Peru. In Peru, the Inca Kola trademark is owned by , which since 1999 is a joint venture between The Coca-Cola Company and the Lindley family, former sole owners of and 

Inca Kola is available in parts of South America, North America and Europe, and while it has not enjoyed major success outside Peru, it can be found in Latin American specialty shops worldwide. Inca Kola is sold in bottles and cans and has an Inca motif.

== History ==
In 1910, in Rímac, one of Lima&#x27;s oldest and most traditional neighborhoods, an immigrant English family began a small bottling company under their family name, Lindley. In 1928, the company was formally chartered in Peru as Corporación José R. Lindley S.A., whereupon Joseph R. Lindley became its first General Manager.

By the early 1930s, the company had a line of ten flavors of soda including Orange Squash, Lemon Squash, Champagne Kola, and Cola Rosada. In 1935, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Lima&#x27;s founding, Lindley introduced what was to become its most noted product, Inca Kola, whose flavor was based on Lemon Verbena (, &quot;Hierbaluisa&quot; or ). He had experimented with various mixtures, other ingredients and levels of carbonation, until finally he came up with this combination of thirteen special plant-derived flavors. The company launched &quot;Inca Kola&quot; under the slogan &quot;There is only one Inca Kola and it&#x27;s like no other&quot; ().

By the mid-1940s, Inca Kola was a market leader in Lima due to an aggressive advertising campaign. Appealing to the Peruvian nationalism that was prevalent among the population, the company positioned Inca Kola as a traditional Peruvian drink, using national and indigenous iconography and images. This advertising campaign was very successful, and bottling volume expanded greatly.

Inca Kola reached levels of 38% market penetration by 1970, eclipsing all other carbonated drinks in Peru and firmly establishing itself as &quot;Peru&#x27;s Drink&quot; (). A common logo in the late 1970s and early 1980s featured the slogan &quot;Made of National Flavor!&quot; (), later changed to &quot;The taste of Peru&quot; ().

On January 22, 2009, Inca Kola partnered with D&#x27;Onofrio, an iconic Peruvian ice cream brand owned by Nestlé, to launch an Inca Kola flavored ice pop.

In the United States, Inca Kola is manufactured by the Coca-Cola company and sold in supermarkets in bottles, cans, and individual bottles.

It also sells a diet version.
== Competition ==
In 1995, Coca-Cola had 32% of the market share of soda sales in Peru while Inca Kola had 32.9%. Since that year, however, the market share for Inca Kola has increased due to some fast food chains including it in their menus. Bembos, a Peruvian fast-food chain, switched from serving Coca-Cola to Inca Kola in 1995. Due to popular demand, McDonald&#x27;s also began to serve Inca Kola at its locations in Peru in 1995, before Coca-Cola owned the Inca Kola brand (at the time, the only place in the world where Coca-Cola agreed to such an arrangement).

Lindley underwent corporate restructuring in 1997. The expansion resulted in a debt load that took a heavy toll, and Lindley lost almost $5 million in 1999. The company, looking for outside help, turned to the Coca-Cola Co., which acquired half of Inca Kola Perú and one-fifth of Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. for an undisclosed sum believed to have been about $200 million. Johnny Lindley Taboada, a grandson of the founder and chairman of Corporación José R. Lindley S.A., became chairman of the joint venture between Coke and Inca Kola. Coca-Cola became the sole owner of the Inca Kola trademark everywhere outside Peru whereas inside Peru a joint-venture agreement was forged. To date, Ecuador and the United States (mostly New York and the rest of the Northeast) are two of the countries where Inca Kola is bottled by the Coca-Cola Company.

During the time that the two giants were negotiating, various smaller companies began to emerge in Peru, selling drinks that competed both with Coca-Cola (Peru Cola, Cola Nacional, Inti Cola, Kola Real, etc.) and Inca Kola (Isaac Kola, Triple Kola, Concordia, Oro etc.). Their main selling point was that Inca Kola was no longer a Peruvian company, having sold out to a foreign company, and therefore not deserving of their money.

During 2004, Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. started talks to buy out Embotelladora Latinoamericana S.A., a bottling business that had been bottling Inca Kola since 1973. They complained that the price of Inca Kola concentrate had increased sixfold since the merger with Coca-Cola. Consequently, they cancelled their contract to bottle Inca Kola in 2000. As a result, in early 2005 Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. purchased two-thirds of Embotelladora Latinoamericana for $215 million. Corporación José R. Lindley S.A. now bottles Inca Kola as well as all the Coca-Cola products using these bottling facilities, with a combined market share of around 60%.

<doc id="429944" wikidata="Q72338" url="?curid=429944" title="Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski">
<text>Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski (3 July 1932 – 21 June 2015) was a politician and trader in the German Democratic Republic. He was director of a main department (&#x27;Hauptverwaltungsleiter&#x27;) in the &quot;Ministry for Foreign Trade and German Domestic Trade&quot; (1956–62), the Deputy Minister for External Trade (1967–75), and head of the GDR&#x27;s &quot;Kommerzielle Koordinierung&quot; (KoKo, 1966–86).

==Early life==

He was born in Berlin to a stateless ethnic Russian father and adopted by the Schalcks when he was eight years old. His biological father served as a Tsarist officer in World War I and became the head of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Russian language interpreter school in World War II; he did not return from Soviet captivity. His maternal grandfather worked for Stinnes in St. Petersburg.

Schalck-Golodkowsky joined the Free German Youth in 1951 and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (&quot;Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands&quot;, SED) in 1955.

==Career in East Germany==

In 1966 he was appointed head of KoKo (at that time a newly formed department of the Ministry for Foreign Trade, ten years later it would formally become a powerful independent government agency in its own right) and in 1967 was also appointed a special officer of the Ministry of State Security. He concurrently held the rank of Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade until 1975, when he was promoted to State Secretary (in the GDR, Deputy Minister was ranked lower than a State Secretary), but was only nominally responsible to the Minister. In reality, he only answered to Erich Honecker, Günter Mittag and Erich Mielke.

In 1983 he led the negotiations with Bavarian leader Franz Josef Strauß to obtain a billion Deutschmarks loan from the West German government.

He was appointed to the central committee of the SED in 1986 and, under suspicion of misusing his powers at KoKo he fled to West Berlin in December 1989. He was briefly imprisoned before settling in Bavaria.

==Post-reunification activities==

Following reunification, the actions of KoKo and of Schalck-Golodkowski head were investigated on suspicions of espionage activities, tax evasion, fraud, breaking embargo regulations and offences against Allied military law. He was prosecuted in 1996 for breaking Allied law and sentenced to a year&#x27;s probation; other charges were withdrawn due to his ill-health—he had operations to remove cancers in 1987 and 1997.

He had been married twice and had two children.

<text>Madge Bellamy (born Margaret Derden Philpott; June 30, 1899 – January 24, 1990) was an American stage and film actress. She was a popular leading lady in the 1920s and early 1930s. Bellamy&#x27;s career declined in the sound era and ended following a romantic scandal in the 1940s.

==Early life==
Margaret Derden Philpott was born in Hillsboro, Texas on June 30, 1899 to William Bledsoe and Annie Margaret Derden Philpott. Bellamy was raised in San Antonio, Texas until she was six years old, and the family later moved to Brownwood, Texas, where her father worked as an English professor at Texas A&amp;M.

As a child, Bellamy took dancing lessons and soon aspired to become a stage performer. She made her stage debut dancing in a local production of &quot;Aida&quot;, at the age of nine.

The Philpotts later moved to Denver, Colorado. Madge met and married Carlos Bellamy in Colorado, but they divorced when she decided to leave Colorado to pursue her acting career. In her autobiography, she later claimed that her agent suggested the name, possibly to avoid the scandal of divorce.

==Career==

===Early years===
Shortly before she was to graduate from high school, Bellamy left home for New York City. She soon began working as a dancer on Broadway. After appearing in the chorus of &quot;The Love Mill&quot; (1917), Bellamy decided to try acting. In 1918, she appeared in a touring production of &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, for which she received good reviews. Bellamy&#x27;s big break came when she replaced Helen Hayes in the Broadway production of &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; opposite William Gillette, in 1918. Bellamy also appeared in the touring production of &quot;Dear Brutus&quot;. While appearing in &quot;Dear Brutus&quot;, Bellamy was cast in a supporting role in her first film &quot;The Riddle: Woman&quot; (1920), starring Geraldine Farrar.

After the tour of &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; ended, Bellamy joined a stock company in Washington D.C., where she appeared in &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;. While a member of the company, Bellamy shot a screen test for director Thomas H. Ince. In November 1920, she signed a three-year contract with Ince&#x27;s newly formed Triangle Film Corporation. Bellamy&#x27;s first film for Triangle was 1921&#x27;s &quot;The Cup of Life&quot;, starring Hobart Bosworth.

===Films===

Bellamy&#x27;s breakout role was as the title character in the 1922 film adaptation of the 1869 novel &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;. She thereafter became known as &quot;the exquisite Madge&quot; (Artist Penrhyn Stanlaws later called her &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in America&quot;), and was cast in several melodramas by Ince. In 1924, Bellamy&#x27;s contract with Ince ended and she signed with Fox Film Corporation where she would stay for the next five years. While at Fox, she appeared in two films for John Ford, &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; (1924) and &quot;Lightnin&#x27;&quot;. By 1925, Bellamy began encountering difficulties due to several &quot;artistic differences&quot; she had with studio executives. That year, she refused to accept a role in the highly successful silent epic &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. She later attributed her career decline to her own choice of wanting to appear in light comedy and flapper roles that showcased her looks instead of more demanding roles.

In 1927, Fox executive Winfield Sheehan, with whom Bellamy was having an affair, attempted to cast her in the lead role of &quot;Diane&quot; in the romantic drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. Bellamy later told author Anthony Slide that she was in fact cast as &quot;Diane&quot;, but was replaced by Janet Gaynor (who won the first Academy Award for Best Actress for her work in the film) when she was in France shooting exterior shots. Bellamy instead appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Very Confidential&quot;, in which she appeared as a model who impersonates a famous female sports figure. In 1928, Bellamy was cast in Fox&#x27;s first part-talking film, &quot;Mother Knows Best&quot; The film was an adaptation of Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel of the same name and features Bellamy as Sally Quail, a stage performer whose life is dominated by her overbearing stage mother &quot;Ma Quail&quot; (Louise Dresser). In the musical sequences, Bellamy impersonated several popular performers of the day including Anna Held, Sir Harry Lauder, and Al Jolson singing &quot;My Mammy&quot; in blackface. Reviews for the film were generally positive with critics noting that Bellamy&#x27;s voice was weak.

Bellamy&#x27;s final silent film, &quot;Fugitives&quot;, was released in 1929. Her first full length, all-talking feature, &quot;Tonight at Twelve&quot;, was released later that year. By the time of its release, Bellamy&#x27;s career had taken a severe downturn due to several ill-advised choices she made in fits of anger (fan magazines of the day called Bellamy &quot;Miss Firecracker&quot; on account of her temperament). Despite her poor behavior off-set, she was still a fairly popular performer and was named an &quot;American Beauty&quot; by the Hollywood Association of Foreign Correspondents. 

In 1929, she walked out on her contract at Fox after refusing to star in the planned film adaptation of &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot;, a 1927 hit Broadway play by Bayard Veiller that the studio bought especially for Bellamy (the film was made later that year at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer starring Norma Shearer). Bellamy later said of her career, &quot;I got too big for my britches. I wanted too much money and when it was not forthcoming, I quit.&quot;

Bellamy attempted to find work as a freelance actress but did not work again until 1932 when she began appearing in Poverty Row films. One of her better known roles from this period was in the 1932 film &quot;White Zombie&quot;, opposite Bela Lugosi and directed by brothers Edward and Victor Hugo Halperin. The film was a moderate success but received mixed reviews while Bellamy&#x27;s performance was generally panned by critics (In a 1970 letter to &quot;Classic Film Collector&quot;, Bellamy claimed her performance appeared bad because she had lost her voice due to a cold and was dubbed by another actress. This has since been proven false). She was slated to appear in the Halperin brothers&#x27; next film, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, but Carole Lombard was cast instead.

===Career decline and scandal===
By the early 1940s, Bellamy&#x27;s career had virtually ended. She garnered considerable media attention when, on January 20, 1943, she was arrested in San Francisco and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after firing a .32 caliber revolver at her former lover, wealthy lumber executive Albert Stanwood Murphy, three times. Bellamy had been having an affair with Murphy for five years before he ended the relationship in October 1942. After learning that Murphy had married former model June Almy shortly after their breakup, Bellamy traveled to San Francisco to confront him and &quot;... make him suffer somehow.&quot;

Bellamy later admitted that she waited around Murphy&#x27;s apartment in the Nob Hill area for four days. She eventually spotted Murphy leaving the Pacific-Union Club on January 20. While Murphy was getting into his car, Bellamy fired three shots at him. She later said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t within speaking distance [of Murphy], but he saw me and shouted something I didn&#x27;t understand. Maybe it was &#x27;don&#x27;t.&#x27; Then I guess I shot at him. He ducked and ran.&quot; She fired three times, hitting Murphy&#x27;s car twice while the third shot missed. Witnesses wrestled the gun out of her hand.

Shortly after the shooting, Bellamy claimed that she did not intend to harm Murphy and that she &quot;... just wanted to see him. He wouldn&#x27;t see me so I took the little gun with me. [...] I had had the little gun so long I thought it was just a toy.&quot; She was also quoted as saying, &quot;I only winged him, which is what I meant to do. Believe me, I&#x27;m a crack shot&quot;. On February 11, 1943, Bellamy pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of violating a gun law and was given a suspended six-month sentence. She was also sentenced to one year of probation.

In July 1943, Bellamy sued Murphy for divorce in Las Vegas claiming that she and Murphy were married by &quot;mutual consent&quot; in April 1941 and had lived as husband and wife up until Murphy ended the relationship. She charged Murphy with &quot;extreme mental cruelty&quot; and asked for both temporary and permanent alimony. In December 1943, Albert Stanwood Murphy asked that the court dismiss the suit, stating that he and Bellamy &quot;are not now and have never been husband and wife&quot;. 

On January 4, 1944, a Nevada court denied Bellamy&#x27;s divorce suit on the grounds that she and Murphy had never legally been married. One day after Bellamy&#x27;s divorce case was dismissed, she was awarded a reported six-figure out-of-court settlement from Murphy.

The shooting and divorce filing generated publicity for Bellamy, but effectively ended her already fading career. She made her last screen appearance in Northwestern film &quot;Northwest Trail&quot; in 1945. Bellamy returned to the stage in 1946 in the Los Angeles production of &quot;Holiday Lady&quot;, after which she retired.

For her contributions to the film industry, Bellamy received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star is located at 6517 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Personal life==
Bellamy was briefly married to bond broker Logan F. Metcalf. They married in Tijuana on January 24, 1928. They separated four days later. Metcalf filed for divorce claiming that while the two were on honeymoon, Bellamy had refused to speak to him because of his fondness for eating ham and eggs, which she considered &quot;plebeian&quot;. Metcalf was granted a divorce on April 25, 1928.

By the time Bellamy retired from acting, she had squandered much of her fortune and lost the remaining money during the Depression. In her posthumously published autobiography, &quot;A Darling of the Twenties&quot;, Bellamy claimed that she lived in &quot;abject poverty&quot; after her retirement. She did, however, have some holdings in real estate and owned a retail shop in which she worked to support herself. In her spare time, Bellamy wrote screenplays and novels which were never purchased. In the early 1980s, she sold the retail shop for double the amount she had paid for it and lived in relative financial comfort for the rest of her life.

Bellamy remained out of public view until the 1980s, when film historians and silent film fans who had rediscovered her work began requesting interviews. She also began attending screenings of the low budget horror film &quot;White Zombie&quot;, which was a moderate success upon its initial release and has since become a cult classic.

Bellamy was an atheist and vegetarian. In her final years, Bellamy lived alone in Ontario, California.

==Death==
She suffered from chronic heart problems toward the end of her life. On January 10, 1990, she checked into the San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland, California for treatment. She died there of heart failure on January 24 at the age of 90. She is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

Her autobiography &quot;A Darling of the Twenties&quot; was published one month after her death.

<doc id="429953" wikidata="Q1473903" url="?curid=429953" title="Albert Howard">
<text>Sir Albert Howard (8 December 187320 October 1947) was an English botanist. His academic background might have been botany. While working in India he was generally considered a pathologist; this more than likely being the reason for his consistent observations of the value of compost applications being an increase in health (of the whole system). Howard was the first Westerner to document and publish the Indian techniques of sustainable agriculture. After spending considerable time learning from Indian peasants and the pests present in their soil, he called these two his professors. He was a principal figure in the early organic movement. He is considered by many in the English-speaking world to have been, along with Eve Balfour, one of the key advocates of ancient Indian techniques of organic agriculture.

==Life==
Albert Howard was born at Bishop&#x27;s Castle, Shropshire. He was the son of Richard Howard, a farmer, and Ann Howard, née Kilvert. He was educated at Wrekin College, Royal College of Science, South Kensington, and as Foundation Scholar, at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1896, he graduated in Biological Sciences at Cambridge, where he also obtained a Diploma of Phytopathology in 1897. 

In 1899, he lectured in Agricultural Science at Harrison College, Barbados, and in 1899 and 1902, was a Mycologist and Agricultural Lecturer at the Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies. 

From 1903 to 1905, he was Botanist at the South Eastern Agricultural College and from 1905 to 1924, Imperial Economic Botanist to the Government of India. 

In 1914, he was created a Companion of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.), and received a Silver Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1920. From 1924 to 1931, Howard was Director of the Institute of Plant Industry, Indore, and Agricultural Adviser to States in Central India and Rajputana. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1928, and in 1930 received the Barclay Memorial Medal of that society. 

He was knighted in 1934, and made an Honourable Fellow of the Imperial College of Science in 1935.

Howard worked in India as agricultural adviser and was in charge of a government research farm at Indore. He worked together with Gabrielle Matthaei (1876–1930), and her sister Louise (1880–1969). He married Gabrielle in 1905. After her death, he married Louise in 1931. Gabrielle was herself a professionally trained and competent botanist, and indeed the contribution of both women to organic farming is said to be underestimated.

Howard observed and came to support traditional Indian farming practices over conventional agricultural science. Though he journeyed to India to teach Western agricultural techniques he found that the Indians could in fact teach him more. One important aspect he took notice of was the connection between healthy soil and the villages&#x27; healthy populations, livestock and crop. Patrick Holden, Director of the UK Soil Association quoted Howard as saying &quot;the health of soil, plant, animal and man is one and indivisible.&quot; He was president of the 13th session of the Indian Science Congress in 1926.

==Organic farming==

Howard built on the traditional Indian composting system into what is now known as the Indore method. He went on to further document Indian organic farming techniques, and spread its knowledge through the UK-based Soil Association, and the Rodale Institute in the US. His 1940 book, &quot;An Agricultural Testament&quot;, is a classic organic farming text. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining humus, keeping water in the soil, and the role of mycorrhiza. It was his first book aimed at the general public, and is his best popularly known work. However his 1931 book &quot;The Waste Products of Agriculture&quot;, based on 26 years of studying improved crop production in Indian smallholdings, is considered by some as his most important scientific publication. His 1945 book &quot;Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease&quot; was also intended for a general audience, and was republished in 1947 as &quot;The Soil and Health: A Study of Organic Agriculture&quot;. Howard&#x27;s documentation of Indian farming practices influenced and inspired many farmers and agricultural scientists who furthered the organic movement, including Lady Eve Balfour (the Haughley Experiment, &quot;The Living Soil&quot;) and J. I. Rodale (Rodale Institute).

Howard advocated studying the forest in order to farm like the forest. He devoted the last half of his career to understanding that end, presaging those contemporary ecologists who advocate the understanding of the interface between ecology and agriculture. Indeed, Howard is grouped, along with Rudolf Steiner, Sir Robert McCarrison and Richard St. Barbe Baker, as one of the key progenitors of the Western organic agriculture movement. (However he says, in the Preface to &quot;An Agricultural Testament&quot;, &quot;Some attention has also been paid to the Bio-Dynamic methods of agriculture in Holland and in Great Britain, but I remain unconvinced that the disciples of Rudolf Steiner can offer any real explanation of natural laws or have yet provided any practical examples which demonstrate the value of their theories.&quot;)

A tribute website from his home town of Bishops Castle is to be found here.

==Publications==
The following is a selection of publications by Albert Howard, including his better known works, and some lesser known publications. His knighthood was conferred in 1934, so in publications prior to that, he is not referred to as &quot;Sir&quot;. Even subsequent to that, he did not always refer to himself as &quot;Sir&quot;, as per his contribution to &quot;Nature&quot; in 1936, and his correspondence to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1939. In the listings below, as far as known, in those from 1945 onwards, he is cited as &quot;Sir Albert Howard&quot;, hence his authorship is not duplicated thereafter. See also External links section, where further publications by him may be read online.

== Explanatory notes ==

a. The online reproduction of Howard&#x27;s 1931 work refers to him as &quot;Sir Albert Howard&quot;. However, this is an error. He was not knighted until 1934, and would not have been referred to as Sir. The error is an artifact of the manner in which Howard&#x27;s name has passed into contemporary public knowledge, via his two most famous books &quot;An Agricultural Testament&quot; (first published 1940), and &quot;Soil and Health&quot; (first published 1945 under a different title, but known mostly by this 1947 title), by which time he was referred to as &quot;Sir&quot;. Indeed, prior to the advent of the internet and the related information explosion, these were the only two works popularly known by all but the most dedicated researchers, with even less known about his life history, beyond brief synopses associated with the books, and replicated in various book descriptions.

<doc id="429954" wikidata="Q274123" url="?curid=429954" title="Edward B. Lewis">
<text>Edward Butts Lewis (May 20, 1918 – July 21, 2004) was an American geneticist, a corecipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He helped to found the field of evolutionary developmental biology.

==Early life==
Lewis was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the second son of Laura Mary Lewis (née Histed) and Edward Butts Lewis, a watchmaker-jeweler. His full name was supposed to be Edward Butts Lewis Jr., but his birth certificate was incorrectly filled out with &quot;B.&quot; as his middle name.

Lewis graduated from E. L. Meyers High School.

== Education and career ==
He received a BA in Biostatistics from the University of Minnesota in 1939, where he worked on &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; in the lab of C.P. Oliver. In 1942 Lewis received a PhD from California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working under the guidance of Alfred Sturtevant. In 1939, Edward B. Lewis arrived at Caltech and finished his PhD within three years. Lewis enrolled in the U.S. Army Air Corps training program in meteorology in 1942 and later received his master&#x27;s degree in the area a year later. As he left for military service in 1943, he was told by the university president Robert A. Millikan that he had a position as an instructor at Caltech when he returned. He served working mostly as a weather forecaster in Hawaii and Okinawa for four years. Lewis returned in 1946 and took his position at Caltech where his duties included helping in the laboratory for an introductory genetics course. He was promoted in 1956 to a professor and became the Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of Biology in 1966.

== Personal life ==
In 1946, Edward B. Lewis met Pamela Harrah (1925–2018). She was an accomplished artist, but also shared Lewis&#x27; interests in animal life. She had gone to Stanford and studied genetics and later discovered the mutant &quot;Polycomb,&quot; that now is important in the understanding of gene regulation. They married and had three sons named Glenn, Hugh, and Keith. Pam developed an infection that caused her to have a visual and physical, partial unilateral paralysis, which limited her mobility.

Lewis maintained a constant exercise routine in his day, as he started his mornings with breakfast and exercise, until he suffered from cancer. Lewis would normally have lunch with his faculty members at the Anthenaeum, then take a nap and return to the laboratory in the evening. The most constant part of his daily routine was that he would do most of his work at night. He also enjoyed playing the flute and would allow himself to have time to play the flute at night. In addition, Lewis appreciated other aspects of life even though they interrupted his typical schedule. Some other things he did with his time include: jogging, swimming, playing on the beach, playing chamber music with friends, going to see movies, and attending opera performances. Edward B. Lewis was a humble man who did not always receive attention for his works. Over time, his work with &quot;Drosophila&quot; became more appreciated and he began to attract more attention.

==Career and research==
His Nobel Prize–winning studies with &quot;Drosophila&quot;, (including the discovery of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; Bithorax complex of homeotic genes, and elucidation of its function), founded the field of evolutionary developmental biology and laid the groundwork for our current understanding of the universal, evolutionarily conserved strategies controlling animal development. He is credited with development of the complementation test. His key publications in the fields of genetics, developmental biology, radiation and cancer are presented in the book &quot;Genes, Development and Cancer&quot;, which was released in 2004.

During the 1950s, Lewis studied the effects of radiation from X-rays, nuclear fallout and other sources as possible causes of cancer. He reviewed medical records from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as radiologists and patients exposed to X-rays. Lewis concluded that &quot;health risks from radiation had been underestimated&quot;. Lewis published articles in &quot;Science&quot; and other journals and made a presentation to a Congressional committee on atomic energy in 1957.

At the scientific level of the debate, the crucial question was whether the &quot;threshold theory&quot; was valid or whether, as Lewis insisted, the effects of radioactivity were &quot;linear with no threshold&quot;, where every exposure to radiation had a long-term cumulative effect.

The issue of linearity versus threshold re-entered the debate on nuclear fallout in 1962, when Ernest Sternglass, a Pittsburgh physicist, argued that the linearity thesis was confirmed by the research of Alice Stewart. (See also John Gofman )

On November 20, 2001, Lewis was interviewed by Elliot Meyerowitz in the Kerckhoff Library at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California. This interview was released on DVD in 2004 as &quot;Conversations in Genetics: Volume 1, No. 3 – Edward B. Lewis; An Oral History of Our Intellectual Heritage in Genetics&quot; 67 min; Producer Rochelle Easton Esposito; The Genetics Society of America.

<text>In classical Greek rhetoric, topos, &quot;pl.&quot; topoi, (from &quot;place&quot;, elliptical for &quot;tópos koinós&quot;, &#x27;common place&#x27;), in Latin locus (from &quot;locus communis&quot;), refers to a method for developing arguments (see &quot;topoi&quot; in classical rhetoric).

==Meaning and history==
Topos is translated variously as &quot;topic&quot;, &quot;themes&quot;, &quot;line of argument&quot;, or &quot;commonplace&quot;. Ernst Robert Curtius studied topoi as &quot;commonplaces&quot;, themes common to orators and writers who re-worked them according to occasion, e.g., in classical antiquity the observation that &quot;all must die&quot; was a topos in consolatory oratory, for in facing death the knowledge that death comes even to great men brings comfort. Curtius also discussed the topoi in the invocation of nature (sky, seas, animals, etc.) for various rhetorical purposes, such as witnessing to an oath, rejoicing or praising God, or mourning with the speaker.

== Lists of themes ==
Some examples of topoi are the following:

* the locus amoenus (for example, the imaginary world of Arcadia) and the locus horridus (for example, Dante&#x27;s Inferno);
* the idyll
* cemetery poetry (see the Spoon River Anthology);
* love and death (in Greek, eros and thanatos), love as disease and love as death, (see the character of Dido in Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid);
* warlike love (see the work Stanze per la giostra by Giuliano de &#x27;Medici by Angelo Poliziano), love as homage (see the courtly lyric poem), painful love;
* the world upside down;
* the dangerous night;
* the infernal hunt (see Boccaccio&#x27;s Decameron, day 5, novel 8);
* aphasia, for example in the presence of the beloved woman (see the works belonging to the Dolce stil novo current, for example Al cor gentil rempaira semper amore by Guido Guinizelli);
* the descensus ad inferos, or catàbasis in Greek (see Dante&#x27;s entire Inferno, or the Aeneid, in his sixth book);
* the desperate search for something, or quête in French;
* the golden age;
* The nostos: the return trip to the homeland (e.g. the &quot;Odyssey&quot;)
* the paraclausithyron, lament before the closed door of the lover;
* the commutatio loci;
* elixir of eternal youth;
* the Fountain of Youth;
* the topos modestiæ;
* pretending that the work is inspired or translated by a pseudobiblion (e.g. &quot;The Betrothed&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;).
* Hybris

* Trope (literature)

<text>Carnival Air Lines Incorporated was a charter and scheduled airline division of the Carnival Corporation &amp; plc that started in 1988 after Carnival Cruise Lines purchased Pacific Interstate Airlines. It was headquartered in Dania Beach, Florida.

==History==
The origins of Carnival Air Lines can be traced to 1984 when Pacific Interstate Airlines was founded in Las Vegas, Nevada. This airline flew charters between Las Vegas and Los Angeles with a single Boeing 727-100 jetliner. In 1985, the name was changed to Pacific Inter Air and then two years later the name was changed to Bahamas ExPress. By this time, the airline was flying out of airports in the East Coast of the US to Freeport in the Bahamas. Carnival Cruise Lines bought the company in 1988 and the airline&#x27;s name was once again changed to Fun Air, but its aircraft was never painted with that name and cruise ship passengers were flown under the name Majestic Air.

The final identity of Carnival Air Lines came to being in 1989 and began flying from Miami, the Northeast USA and later on expanded to other destinations, with its home base in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. (See routes below).

In 1992, Carnival Air Lines began a code-share agreement with Iberia of Spain to transport connecting passengers from Madrid to Los Angeles via Carnival&#x27;s Miami Hub. The route was originally operated by a Boeing 737-400 but was replaced in 1994 with Carnival&#x27;s first Airbus A300B4. In 1993, Carnival began operating its first wide-body aircraft by flying Lan Chile&#x27;s Boeing 767 as part of the agreement with the Chilean airline. The exclusive route was from Miami to New York&#x27;s JFK airport. In 1995, when the agreement with LAN-Chile was not renewed, another agreement was formed with Ladeco of Chile to transport connecting passengers from Santiago to New York via Carnival&#x27;s Miami Hub flying a Carnival Airbus A300 in LADECO&#x27;s livery.

In September 1997, Pan Am Corporation, a holding company formed by the reincarnated Pan American Airways, bought Carnival Air Lines in an attempt to bolster its fleet and operations into a new airline based on the old Pan Am. Before the airlines could fully merge, the holding company and its two independently operated airlines, Pan Am and Carnival, filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased scheduled flight operations in February 1998. The air operator&#x27;s certificate used for the reincarnated Pan Am was abandoned in favor of the acquired Carnival operating certificate. Pan Am, now operating with the Carnival certificate, quickly resumed limited charter operations while new owner Guilford Transportation Industries of Massachusetts acquired certain assets of the bankrupt companies after court approval. The new company emerged from bankruptcy in June 1998 and discontinued the use of the &quot;Carnival&quot; brand name for the &quot;Pan Am&quot; name and logo instead. Guilford ceased operating Pan Am and relinquished its original Carnival airworthiness certificate on November 1, 2004.

where &quot;M&quot; is Moreau&#x27;s necklace-counting function,

:formula_2

and &quot;μ&quot; is the classic Möbius function of number theory. 

The name comes from the denominator, 1 − &quot;z&quot; &quot;j&quot;, which is the product of cyclotomic polynomials.

The left hand side of the cyclotomic identity is the generating function for the free associative algebra on α generators, and the right hand side is the generating function for the universal enveloping algebra of the free Lie algebra on α generators. The cyclotomic identity witnesses the fact that these two algebras are isomorphic. 

There is also a symmetric generalization of the cyclotomic identity found by Strehl:

<doc id="429985" wikidata="Q19819982" url="?curid=429985" title="Imamate in Shia doctrine">
<text>In Shia Islam, the Imamah () is a doctrine which asserts that certain individuals from the lineage of the Islamic prophet Muhammad are to be accepted as leaders and guides of the ummah after the death of Muhammad. Imamah further says that Imams possess divine knowledge and authority (Ismah) as well as being part of the Ahl al-Bayt, the family of Muhammad. These Imams have the role of providing commentary and interpretation of the Quran as well as guidance.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Imām&quot; denotes a person who stands or walks &quot;in front&quot;. For Sunni Islam, the word is commonly used to mean a person who leads the course of prayer in the mosque. It also means the head of a &quot;madhhab&quot; (&quot;school of thought&quot;). However, from the Shia point of view this is merely the &quot;basic&quot; understanding of the word in the Arabic language and, for its proper religious usage, the word &quot;Imam&quot; is applicable &quot;only&quot; to those members of the house of Muhammad designated as infallible by the preceding Imam.

== Introduction ==
The Shia further believe only these A&#x27;immah have the right to be Caliphs, meaning that all other caliphs, whether elected by consensus (&quot;Ijma&quot;) or not, are usurpers of the Caliphate as those were political positions, not divine positions.

All Muslims believe that Muhammad had said: &quot;To whomsoever I am Mawla, Ali is his Mawla.&quot; This hadith has been narrated in different ways by many different sources in no less than 45 hadith books of both Sunni and Shia collections. This hadith has also been narrated by the collector of hadiths, al-Tirmidhi, 3713; as well as Ibn Maajah, 121; etc. The major point of conflict between the Sunni and the Shia is in the interpretation of the word &#x27;Mawla&#x27;. For the Shia the word means &#x27;Master&#x27; and has the same elevated significance as when the term had been used to address Muhammad himself during his lifetime. Thus, when Muhammad actually (by speech) and physically (by way of having his closest companions including Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman (the three future Caliphs who had preceded Ali as Caliph) &quot;publicly&quot; accept Ali as their Master by taking Ali&#x27;s hand in both of theirs as token of their allegiance to Ali) &quot;transferred&quot; this title and manner of addressing Ali as the Mawla for all Muslims at Ghadiri Khum Oasis just a few months before his death, the people that came to look upon Ali as Muhammad&#x27;s &quot;immediate successor&quot; even before Muhammad&#x27;s death came to be known as the Shia. However, for Sunnis the word simply means the &#x27;beloved&#x27; or the &#x27;revered&#x27; and has no other significance at all.

== Sects ==

Within Shia Islam (Shiism), the various sects came into being because they differed over their Imams&#x27; successions, just as the Shia–Sunni separation within Islam itself came into being from the dispute that had arisen over the succession to Muhammad. Each succession dispute brought forth a different tariqah (literal meaning &#x27;path&#x27;; extended meaning &#x27;sect&#x27;) within Shiism. Each Shia tariqah followed its own particular Imam&#x27;s dynasty, resulting in different numbers of Imams for each particular Shia tariqah. When the dynastic line of the separating successor Imam ended with no heir to succeed him, then either he (the last Imam) or his unborn successor was believed to have gone into a concealment known as The Occultation.

The Shia tariqah with a majority of adherents are the Twelvers who are commonly known as &quot;Shia&quot;. After that come the Nizari Ismailis commonly known as the Ismailis, then the Mustalian Ismailis also called the &quot;Bohras&quot;, and there are further schisms within their Bohri tariqah. The Druze tariqah initially were part of the Fatimid Ismailis but separated from them after the death of the Fatimid Imam and Caliph Al Hakim Bi Amrillah. The Shia Sevener tariqah no longer exists. Another small tariqah is that of the Zaidi Shias, or the &quot;Fivers&quot;; they do not believe in the Occultation of their last Imam.

Although all these different Shia tariqahs belong to the Shia (as opposed to the Sunni) sect in Islam, there are major doctrinal differences between the main Shia tariqahs. After that there is the complete doctrinal break between all the different Shia tariqahs whose last Imams have gone into Occultation and the Shia Nizari Ismailis, who deny the concept of Occultation and so have to have a present and living Imam until the end of time. 

===Twelver view===


Shias believe that Imamah is of the Principles of Faith (Usul al-Din). As the verse 4:165 of Quran expresses the necessity to the appointment of the prophets, so after the demise of the prophet who will play the role of the prophet, until the people have no plea against Allah. The same logic that necessitated the assignment of prophets also is applied for Imamah. That is, Allah must assign someone similar to the prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people without any deviation in religion.

They refer to the verse 5:3 (&quot;This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion&quot;) of the Quran which was revealed to the prophet when he appointed Ali as his successor at the day of Ghadir Khumm.
By the verse Quran, 2:124, Shias believe that Imamah is a divine position always Imamah is accompanied by the word guidance, of course a guidance by God&#x27;s Command. A kind of guidance which brings humanity to the goal. no age can be without an Imam. Regarding 17:71, So, according to the upper verse, 1. Imamah is a position which is appointed by God and must be specified by Him; 2. Imam is protected by a divine protection and no one excels him in nobility; 3. No age can be without an Imam and finally Imam knows everything which is needed for human being to get to the truth and goal.

====Why only specific members of Muhammad&#x27;s family?====
Sunnis reject the doctrine of Imamate on the basis of their interpretation of verse 33:40 of the Qur&#x27;an which says that Muhammad, as the , &quot;is not the father of any of your men&quot;; and that is why God let Muhammad&#x27;s sons die in infancy. This is why Muhammad did not nominate a successor, as he wanted to leave the succession to be resolved &quot;by the Muslim Community on the basis of the Qur’anic principle of consultation ()&quot;. The question Madelung proposes here is why the family members of Muhammad should not inherit aspects of Muhammad&#x27;s character, apart from prophethood, such as rule (), wisdom (), and leadership (). Since the Sunni concept of the &quot;true caliphate&quot; itself defines it as a &quot;succession of the Prophet in every respect except his prophethood&quot;, Madelung further asks, &quot;If God really wanted to indicate that he should not be succeeded by any of his family, why did He not let his grandsons and other kin die like his sons?&quot;

It is narrated that it is forbidden for the Divine Leader not to be from the family of Muhammad. According to Ali al-Ridha, since it is obligatory to obey him, there should be a sign to clearly indicate the Divine Leader. That sign is his well-known ties of kinship with Muhammad and his clear appointment so that the people could distinguish him from others, and be clearly guided toward him. Otherwise others are nobler than Muhammad&#x27;s offspring and they are to be followed and obeyed; and the offspring of Muhammad are obedient and subject to the offspring of Muhammad&#x27;s enemies such as Abi Jahl or Ibn Abi Ma’eet. However, Muhammad is much nobler than others to be in charge and to be obeyed. Moreover, once the prophethood of Muhammad is testified they would obey him, no one would hesitate to follow his offspring and this would not be hard for anyone. While to follow the offspring of the corrupted families is difficult. And that is maybe why the basic characteristic of Muhammad and other prophets was their nobility. For none of them, it is said, were originated from a disgraced family. It is believed that all Muhammad&#x27;s ancestors up to Adam were true Muslims. Jesus was also from a pious family, as it is mentioned in the Quran that after his birth, people said to Mary: &quot;O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.&quot;

===The Ismā&#x27;īlī view===
The doctrine of the Imamate in Isma&#x27;ilism differs from that of the Twelvers because the Isma&#x27;ilis had living Imams for centuries after the last Twelver Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, went into hiding. They followed Isma&#x27;il ibn Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful Imam after his father, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja&#x27;far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il as the next imam.

According to Isma&#x27;ilism, God has sent seven great prophets known as &quot;Nātiq&quot;s &quot;Speaker&quot; in order to disseminate and improve his dīn of &quot;Islam&quot;. All of these great prophets has also one assistant known as &quot;Sāmad&quot; &quot;Silent&quot; Imām. At the end of each seven &quot;Sāmad&quot; silsilas, one great &quot;Nātiq&quot; has been sent in order to improve the faith. After Adam and his son Seth, and after six &quot;Nātiq–Sāmad&quot; silsila (Noah–Shem, Abraham–Ishmael, Moses–Aaron, Jesus–Simeon, son of Jacob, Muhammad–Ali), the silsila of &quot;Nātiq&quot;s and &quot;Sāmad&quot;s have been completed with Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il.

====Why Imams from only (specific) family members====
Ismailis view Imams as the true representative of God. God has made all prophets his representative. Individual prophets era are distinct. After one prophets God created next prophet. Islam view that Mohammed is last prophet. Mohammed appointed his specific representative Ali. Ali made imams as his next representative and one imam appointed another until date. The Isma&#x27;ili view that these Imam are only from their hereditary chain and their appointment is a must, and Earth cannot remain vacant, without presence of Imam.

===Zaidi view===

Zaidiyyah or Zaidi is a Shia madhhab (sect, school) named after the imam Zayd ibn Ali. Followers of the Zaidi fiqh are called Zaidis (or are occasionally called Fivers in the West). However, there is also a group called the Zaidi &quot;Wasītī&quot;s who are Twelvers.

In the context of the Shi&#x27;a Muslim belief in spiritual leadership or Imamate, Zaydis believe that the leader of the Ummah or Muslim community must be &quot;Fatimids&quot;: descendants of Muhammad through his only surviving daughter Fatimah, whose sons were Hasan ibn ʻAlī and Husayn ibn ʻAlī. These Shi&#x27;a called themselves Zaydi so they could differentiate themselves from other Shi&#x27;is who refused to take up arms with Zayd ibn Ali.

Zaydis believe Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the Imamate because he led a rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate, who he believed were tyrannical and corrupt. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action and the followers of Zayd believed that a true Imām must fight against corrupt rulers. The renowned Muslim jurist Abu Hanifa, who is credited for the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, delivered a fatwā or legal statement in favour of Zayd in his rebellion against the Umayyad ruler. He also urged people in secret to join the uprising and delivered funds to Zayd.

Unlike Twelver Shi&#x27;ites, Zaydis do not believe in the infallibility of Imāms The Imamate can be passed down to anyone of the household of Muhammad.

==The period of occultation==
===Twelver view===

The period of occultation (&quot;ghaybah&quot;) is divided into two parts:

* &quot;Ghaybah al-Sughra&quot; or Minor Occultation (874–941) consists of the first few decades after the Imam&#x27;s disappearance when communication with him was maintained through deputies of the Imam.
* &quot;Ghaybah al-Kubra&quot; or Major Occultation began in 941 and is believed to continue until a time decided by God, when the Mahdi will reappear to bring absolute justice to the world.

During the Minor Occultation (&quot;Ghaybah al-Sughrá&quot;), it is believed that al-Mahdi maintained contact with his followers via deputies (, &quot;the Four Leaders&quot;). They represented him and acted as agents between him and his followers. Whenever the believers faced a problem, they would write their concerns and send them to his deputy. The deputy would ascertain his verdict, endorse it with his seal and signature and return it to the relevant parties. The deputies also collected zakat and khums on his behalf.

For the Shia, the idea of consulting a hidden Imam was not something new because the two prior Twelver Imams had, on occasion, met with their followers from behind a curtain. Also, during the oppressive rule of the later Abbasid caliphs, the Shia Imams were heavily persecuted and held prisoners, thus their followers were forced to consult their Imams via messengers or secretly.

Shia Tradition hold that four deputies acted in succession to one another:

# Uthman ibn Sa’id al-Asadi
# Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman
# Abul Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti
# Abul Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri

In 941 (329 AH), the fourth deputy announced an order by al-Mahdi, that the deputy would soon die and that the deputyship would end and the period of the Major Occultation would begin.

The fourth deputy died six days later and the Shia Muslims continue to await the reappearance of the Mahdi. In the same year, many notable Shia scholars such as Ali ibn Babawayh Qummi and Muhammad ibn Ya&#x27;qub Kulayni, the learned compiler of &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot;, also died.

One view is that the Hidden Imam is on earth &quot;among the body of the Shia&quot; but &quot;incognito&quot;. &quot;Numerous stories&quot; exist of the Hidden Imam &quot;manifesting himself to prominent members of the ulama&quot;.

===The Ismā&#x27;īlī view===

The Ismailis differ from Twelvers because they had living imams for centuries after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed Isma&#x27;il ibn Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful Imam after his father Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja&#x27;far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son Muḥammad ibn Ismail as the next imam. Thus, their line of imams is as follows (the years of their individual imamats during the Common Era are given in brackets):

====First phase====
The eighth Imam, Abd Allah al-Akbar of the Ismaili Shia remained hidden but continued the Ismaili movement in the 9th century in Salamiyah, Syria. The eighth to tenth Imams (Abadullah, Ahmed and Husain), remained hidden and worked for the movement against the period&#x27;s time&#x27;s rulers. First phase of seclusion ends with 10th Imam. The 11th Imam Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, under the guise of being a merchant, and his son had made their way to Sijilmasa, fleeing persecution by the Abbasids. Imam Abdullah founded Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimid Ismaili Imams continued until the 20th Imam also holding the post of caliph, ruling a vast part of the Arabian peninsula.

====Second phase====
Upon the death of the twentieth Imam, al-Amir bi-Ahkami&#x27;l-Lah (d. ), his two-year-old child at-Tayyib Abu&#x27;l-Qasim (b. ) was appointed twenty-first Imam. The supporters of Tayyeb became the Tayyibi Ismāʿīlī. As Tayyeb was not in a position to run the dawah, Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi, the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, acted as his regent. Imam Tayyeb was hidden, and the second phase of seclusion started. The Da&#x27;i had now been given absolute authority and made independent from political activity. With the period of time the Tayyibi divided further into several sects headed by different Dais. These Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq continued acting on behalf of the hidden Tayyibi Ismāʿīlī Imams until date. Dawoodi Bohra is the biggest sub-sect amongst the Tayyibi Ismāʿīlī with a population spread over many countries.

== Imams ==
===Twelver Imams===

According to the majority of Shī&#x27;a, namely the Twelvers (&quot;Ithnā&#x27;ashariyya&quot;), the following is a listing of the rightful successors to Muḥammad. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam except for Hussayn ibn &#x27;Alī, who was the brother of Hassan ibn &#x27;Alī.The belief in this succession to Muḥammad stems from various Quranic verses which include: 75:36, 13:7, 35:24, 2:30, 2:124, 36:26, 7:142, 42:23. They support their discussion by citing Genesis 17:19–20 and Sunni hadith:Sahih Muslim, Hadith number 4478, English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui.

====List of The Twelve Imams====

According to Twelvers, there is always an Imam of the era, who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis&#x27; view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.

=== Ismaili Imams ===

The Ismaili line of imams for both sects (the Nizari and Musta&#x27;li) continues undivided until al-Mustansir Billah (d. 1094). After his death the line of the imamat separates into the Nizari and Musta&#x27;li dynasties.

The line of imams of the Musta&#x27;li Muslims (also known as the Bohras/Dawoodi Bohra) continued up to Aamir ibn Mustali. After his death, they believe their 21st Imam, at-Tayyib Abu&#x27;l-Qasim went into a Dawr-e Satr (period of concealment) that continues to this day. In the absence of an imam they are led by a Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq (absolute missionary) who manages the affairs of the Imam-in-Concealment until re-emergence of the Imam from concealment.

The line of imams of the Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslims (also known as the Agha-khani Ismailis in South and Central Asia) continues to their present living 50th hereditary imam, Aga Khan V (son of Aga Khan IV). They are the only Shia Muslim community today led by a present and living (Hazir wa Mawjud) imam.

=== Zaidi Imams ===

The Zaidi branch of Shi&#x27;ism established its own line of Imams starting in the year 897; the line continued without interruption until 1962 when the North Yemen Civil War brought the Imamate to an end and established a republic.

== Sunni view of the Shia Imamate ==
Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 AH/1328 AD) composed a long refutation of the notion of the Imamate in his &quot;Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah&quot;.

The belief of the Twelver Imamah with the consideration of the sacred status of the four Rashidun Caliphs is shared in Sunni Islam, due to the following hadith of Muhammad:

<doc id="429997" wikidata="Q2292459" url="?curid=429997" title="Organisation (band)">
<text>Organisation zur Verwirklichung gemeinsamer Musikkonzepte (German: &quot;Organisation for the Realisation of Shared Music Concepts&quot;) was an experimental krautrock band, that was the immediate predecessor of the band Kraftwerk. In addition to the founding members of Kraftwerk, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider-Esleben, Organisation included Basil Hammoudi, Butch Hauf, and Fred Monicks. The band was assisted by Paul Lorenz, Peter Martini, and Charly Weiss during their career.

==History==
A video recording by German TV broadcaster WDR exists of the band performing &quot;Ruckzuck&quot;, a piece that appeared on the first Kraftwerk album in 1970. The performance took place at the Grugahalle in Essen on 25 April 1970 as part of the Internationales Essener Pop &amp; Blues Festival. This was their last performance as Organisation, Hütter and Schneider-Esleben (later just Schneider) went on to form Kraftwerk, leaving Hammoudi, Hauf and Monicks to go to university.

Their only album, &quot;Tone Float&quot;, produced and engineered by Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Plank along with the band themselves, was released on the RCA Victor label in the United Kingdom in 1970. As it was available in Germany only as an import, sales were poor and RCA opted to drop the band shortly afterwards, at which point Hütter and Schneider-Esleben left the band to form Kraftwerk, with Organisation dissolving as a result. Hammoudi, Hauf and Mönicks all returned to university to complete their studies. Hammoudi was later a member of jazz-rock band Ibliss, along with early Kraftwerk drummer Andreas Hohmann.

According to Mönicks (interviewed in the mid-1990s and June 2002 - January 2003.) the quintet had already begun to perform under the name Kraftwerk some time after &quot;Tone Float&quot; had been recorded, but RCA had been keen for them to have a band name more appropriate to the English market, since the album was to be issued only in the UK, so the name Organisation was used.

<text>Universal Network Objects (UNO) is the component model used in the OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice computer software application suites. It is interface-based and designed to offer interoperability between different programming languages, object models and machine architectures, on a single machine, within a LAN or over the Internet.

Users can implement or access UNO components from any programming language for which a language binding exists. Complete UNO language bindings exist for C++ (compiler-dependent), Java, Object REXX, Python, and Tcl. Bindings allowing access, but not writing, to components exist for StarOffice Basic, OLE Automation and the .NET Common Language Infrastructure. In particular, this API is used by macros.

Universal Network Objects operate within the UNO Runtime Environment (URE).

The Apache OpenOffice version of UNO is released under the terms Apache License (Version 2) as free and open source software.

== UNO for function-calling ==
Examples: an external program can export an ODT file as a PDF file, or import and convert a DOCX, calling LibreOffice by the UNO interface. Another external program can access a cell and formulas from LibreOffice Calc file.

Application examples: &quot;Docvert&quot;, &quot;JODConverter&quot;, &quot;unoConv&quot;.

== UNO for Add-Ons ==
Programmers can write and integrate their own UNO components to OpenOffice/LibreOffice. Those components can be added to the LibreOffice menus and toolbars; they are called &quot;Add-Ons&quot;.
The Add-Ons can extend the functionality of LibreOffice.

The integration of new components is supported by some tools and services. The three main steps are as follows:

#Register the new components within LibreOffice. This can be accomplished using the tool codice_1.
#Integrate the new components as services. The ProtocolHandler and JobDispatch services assist you.
#Change the user interface (menus or toolbars). This can be done almost automatically by writing an XML text file that describes the changes.

Application example: &quot;jOpenDocument&quot;.

<doc id="430006" wikidata="Q2151537" url="?curid=430006" title="Scup">
<text>The scup (Stenotomus chrysops) is a fish that occurs primarily in the Atlantic from Massachusetts to South Carolina. Along with many other fish of the family Sparidae, it is also commonly known as porgy.

Scup grow as large as and weigh , but they average . Scup can live up to 20 years; females can begin to reproduce at the age of two. Every year female scups lay approximately 7,000 eggs in sand and weed abundant areas.

In the Middle Atlantic Bight, scup spawn along the inner continental shelf. Their larvae end up in inshore waters, along the coast and in estuarine areas. At two to three years of age, they mature. Scup winter along the mid and outer continental shelf. When the temperature warms in the spring, they migrate inshore.

They are fished for by both commercial and recreational fishermen. The scup fishery is one of the oldest in the United States, with records dating back to 1800. Scup was the most abundant fish in colonial times. Fishermen began using trawls in 1929, which increased catches dramatically. The species was termed overfished in 1996, and today there is evidence of a rebound. Today, scup are still caught primarily using an otter trawl.

==Cuisine==

The flesh is &quot;firm and flaky&quot;, with a &quot;sweet almost shrimplike flavor&quot;. Many consumers like their light flavor and they are characterized as panfish. Popular methods of cooking include frying, broiling, and baking.

Though the flesh is similar to that of more prestigious fish in the sea bream family like daurade and orata, the names &quot;scup&quot; and &quot;porgy&quot; are sometimes considered unattractive, leading to culinary names like orata Americana and Montauk sea bream.

Its similarity to &quot;Pagrus major&quot; and its mild and fatty characteristics makes it suitable for sushi.

==Management==
Scup are heavily fished commercially and recreationally. Management measures for the species generally include size limits, bag limits, fishing seasons, and equipment requirements. Scup are also managed through quotas that are separately regulated during the different seasons. In Massachusetts, management plans result in the distribution of 78% of the yearly permitted harvest of scups for commercial purposes, and 22% for recreational fishing.

==Fishing==
Since scups attack bait frantically, squid strips are the most common choice of bait because they stay intact and suspended on the hook after several strikes. Anglers also use sand-worms and clam as baits for scup due to clams and worms being part of the scups actual diet.

<doc id="430007" wikidata="Q144287" url="?curid=430007" title="Zayd ibn Ali">
<text>Zayd ibn ʿAlī (; 695–740), also spelled Zaid, was the son of Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, and great-grandson of Ali ibn Abi Talib. He led an unsuccessful revolt against the Umayyad Caliphate, in which he died. The event gave rise to the Zaydiyya sect of Shia Islam, which holds him as the next Imam after his father Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-Abidin. Zayd ibn Ali is also seen as a major religious figure by many Sunnis and was supported by the prominent Sunni jurist, Abu Hanifa, who issued a fatwa in support of Zayd against the Umayyads.

To Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili Shias however, his elder half-brother Muhammad al-Baqir is seen as the next Imam of the Shias. Nevertheless, he is considered an important revolutionary figure by Shias and a martyr (&quot;shaheed&quot;) by all schools of Islam, including Sunnis and Shias.
The call for revenge for his death, and for the brutal display of his body, contributed to the Abbasid Revolution.

Zayd was a learned religious scholar. Various works are ascribed to him, including &quot;Musnad al-Imam Zayd&quot; (published by E. Grifinni as &quot;Corpus Iuris di Zaid b. ʿAlī&quot;, also known as &quot;Majmuʿ al-Fiqh&quot;), possibly the earliest known work of Islamic law. However, the attribution is disputed; these likely represent early Kufan legal tradition.

==Birth==
Zayd was born in Medina in 695 CE. He was the son of Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-Abidin. Ibn Qutaybah in his book &quot;al-Ma&#x27;ārif&quot;, republished in 1934 in Egypt, writes (at page 73) that one of the wives of the 4th Shia Imam was from Sindh (present-day Pakistan) and that she was the mother of Zayd ibn Ali. A similar claim has also been made in the book &quot;Zayd Shaheed&quot; by Abd al-Razzaq al-Hasani, published in Najaf. Zayd&#x27;s mother Jodha was known by Muslim chroniclers as Jayda al-Sindiyya.

==Contemporary opinions==
Zayd was a revered member of the &quot;Bayt&quot; (Household) of Muhammad. Scholars, Saints, Sufis and Imams alike, all spoke of him in respectful terms. When the ascetic Umayyad Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was the Governor of Madinah during the reign of Al-Walid and Suleiman, he was an associate of Zayd ibn Ali. Zayd continued to correspond and advise him when he became the Khalifah.

Zayd is believed the first narrator of &quot;Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya&quot; of Imam Zainul-&#x27;Abidin. Several works of hadith, theology, and Qur&#x27;anic exegesis are attributed to him. The first work of Islamic jurisprudence Mujmu&#x27;-al-Fiqh is attributed to him. The only surviving hand-written manuscript of this work dating back to at least a thousand years is preserved in the pope&#x27;s library, Bibliotheca Vaticana in Vatican City under &quot;Vaticani arabi&quot;. Photocopies of this rare work are available in several libraries including the Library of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. In 2007, Sayyid Nafis Shah Al-Husayni Sayed Nafees al-Hussaini obtained a copy of this work, and re-issued it from Lahore.

He was an excellent orator and spent much of his life learning and educating others. It is said that his half-brother, Imam al-Baqir, wanted to test him on the Quranic knowledge, asking him various questions for which he received answers beyond his expectation, causing to him to remark, &quot;For our father and mother&#x27;s life! You are one of a kind. God grace your mother who gave you birth, she gave birth to a replica of your forefathers!&quot; Al-Baqir also said: &quot;No one of us was born to resemble &#x27;Ali ibn Abi Talib more than he did.&quot;

When describing Zayd, his nephew, Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, said: &quot;Among us he was the best read in the Holy Qur&#x27;an, and the most knowledgeable about religion, and the most caring towards family and relatives.&quot; Hence his title &quot;Ḥalīf Al-Qurʾān&quot; (). Jafar Sadiq&#x27;s love for his uncle Zayd was immense. Upon receiving and reading the letter of Zayd ibn Ali&#x27;s death he broke down and cried uncontrollably, and proclaimed aloud:

Imam Ali ar-Ridha said:
In one hadith, the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifa once said about Imam Zayd, &quot;I met with Zayd and I never saw in his generation a person more knowledgeable, as quick a thinker, or more eloquent than he was.&quot; However, in another hadith, Abu Hanifa said: &quot;I have not seen anyone with more knowledge than Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad.&quot; Imam Abu Hanifa was reportedly a student of Imam Ja&#x27;far, like another great Imam of Sunni &quot;Fiqh&quot;, that is Malik ibn Anas.

The Sufi scholar, Mujtahid and mystic, Sufyan al-Thawri, respected Imam Zayd&#x27;s knowledge and character, saying &quot;Zayd took the place of Imam al-Husayn. He was the most versed human concerning Allah&#x27;s holy book. I affirm: women have not given birth to the likes of Zayd ... &quot;

Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid the writer of the famous Shi&#x27;ah book Kitab al Irshad described him as, &quot; ... a devout worshipper, pious, a jurist, God-fearing and brave.&quot;

==Prophecy of martyrdom==
Imam al-Baqir narrated: 
The Holy Prophet put his sacred hand on Al-Husayn bin Ali&#x27;s back and said: &quot;O Husayn, it will not be long until a man will be born among your descendants. He will be called Zaid; he will be killed as a martyr. On the day of resurrection, he and his companions will enter heaven, setting their feet on the necks of the people.&quot;

Imam Husayn narrated that his grandfather Muhammad prophesied his death:
==Death==
In AH 122 (AD 740), Zayd led an uprising against the Umayyad rule of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in the city of Kufa. Initially Zayd had the support of the people of Kufa but then they asked him for his opinions on Umar and Abu Bakr, to which Zayd replied:
May God have mercy on both of them and forgive them both! I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them. .
At this many of his Shia supporters abandoned him.

Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, the Umayyad governor of Iraq, managed to bribe the inhabitants of Kufa which allowed him to break the insurgence, killing Zayd in the process.

==Shrines==
There are two shrines for Zayd, One is in Kafel, Iraq, the other is in Karak, Jordan. The shrine in Jordan is believed to be the final resting place of the head of Zayd ibn &#x27;Ali ibn Al-Husayn.

According to later—and most likely invented—tradition, relayed by the 14th-century historian al-Maqrizi, Zayd&#x27;s severed head was brought to Egypt, and displayed at the Mosque of Amr in Fustat, until it was stolen and buried. A mosque was erected over the site. When it fell into ruin by the early 12th century, the Fatimid vizier, al-Afdal Shahanshah, ordered it excavated, and the head was placed in a purpose-built shrine on 1 March 1131. This building, inaccurately known as the Shrine of Zayn al-Abidin (Zayd&#x27;s father), was located some north of the Mosque of Amr, and was entirely rebuilt twice in the 19th century. Nothing of it survives today.

==Legacy==
All schools of Islam, Sunnis and Shias, regard Zayd as a righteous martyr against what was regarded as the corrupt leadership of an unjust king proclaimed to be a caliph. It is even reported that Mujtahid Imam Abu Hanifa, founder of the largest school of Sunni jurisprudence, gave financial support to Zayd&#x27;s revolt, and called on others to join Zayd&#x27;s rebellion. Zayd&#x27;s rebellion inspired other revolts by members of his clan, especially in the Hejaz, the most famous among these being the revolt of Imam Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya &quot;al-Mahdi&quot; against the Abbasids in 762. 

Zaydis believe that he was a rightful Caliph, and their sect is named after him. It is believed that from them originated the word for Shi&#x27;ites, Rafida.

<doc id="430008" wikidata="Q1156634" url="?curid=430008" title="Ice cream cone">
<text>An ice cream cone (England) or poke (Ireland) is a brittle, cone-shaped pastry, usually made of a wafer similar in texture to a waffle, made so ice cream can be carried and eaten without a bowl or spoon. Many styles of cones are made, including pretzel cones, sugar-coated and chocolate-coated cones (coated on the inside). The term &quot;ice cream cone&quot; can also refer, informally, to the cone with one or more scoops of ice cream on top.

There are two techniques for making cones: one is by baking them flat and then quickly rolling them into shape (before they harden), the other is by baking them inside a cone-shaped mold.

==History==

=== 19th century ===

Cones, in the form of wafers rolled and baked hard, date back to Ancient Rome and Greece. When exactly they transitioned to being used for desserts, and ice cream in particular, is not clear. Some historians point to France in the early 19th century as the birthplace of the ice cream cone: an 1807 illustration of a Parisian girl enjoying a treat may depict an ice cream cone and edible cones were mentioned in French cooking books as early as 1825, when Julien Archambault described how one could roll a cone from &quot;little waffles&quot;. In 1846, the Italian British cook Charles Elmé Francatelli&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Cook&quot; described the use of ice cream cones as part of a larger dessert dish.

The earliest certain evidence of ice cream cones come from &quot;Mrs A. B. Marshall&#x27;s Book of Cookery&quot; (1888), written by the English cook Agnes B. Marshall. Her recipe for &quot;Cornet with Cream&quot; said that &quot;the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons&quot;. Marshall is consequently often regarded to have been the inventor of the modern ice cream cone.

=== 20th century ===

In the United States, edible vessels for ice cream took off at the start of the 1900s. Molds for edible ice cream cups entered the scene in 1902 and 1903, with two Italian inventors and ice cream merchants. , from Manchester, patented a novel apparatus resembling a cup-shaped waffle iron, made &quot;for baking biscuit-cups for ice-cream&quot; over a gas range. The following year, , from New York City, patented an improved design with a break-apart bottom so that more unusual cup shapes could be created out of the delicate waffle batter.
At the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in 1904, after an ice cream vendor ran out of paper cups, a Syrian concessionaire named Ernest A. Hamwi offered a solution by curling a waffle cookie into a receptacle for the ice cream. This is believed by some (although there is much dispute) to be the moment where ice cream cones became mainstream. Hamwi started his own cone-making company a few years later.

Abe Doumar and the Doumar family of Norfolk, Virginia, also claim credit for the ice cream cone. At 16, Doumar began selling paperweights and other items. One night, he bought a waffle from another vendor, , who was transplanted from Ghent in Belgium to Norfolk. Doumar rolled the waffle on itself and placed a scoop of ice cream on top. He began selling the cones at the St. Louis Exposition. After his &quot;cones&quot; were successful, Doumar designed and had manufactured a four-iron baking machine. At the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, he and his brothers sold nearly twenty-three thousand cones. After that, Abe bought a semiautomatic 36-iron machine, which produced 20 cones per minute and opened Doumar&#x27;s Cones and BBQ in Norfolk, which still operates at the same location.

In 2008, the ice cream cone became the official state dessert of Missouri.

=== Commerce ===

By 1912, an inventor by the name of Frederick Bruckman, from Portland, Oregon, perfected a complex machine for molding, baking, and trimming ice cream cones with incredible speed. Inventions like this paved the way for the wholesaling of ice cream cones. He sold his company in 1928 to Nabisco, which is still producing ice cream cones as of 2017. Other ice cream providers such as Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s make their own cones.

===Prefilling===

In 1928, J. T. &quot;Stubby&quot; Parker of Fort Worth, Texas, created an ice cream cone that could be stored in a grocer&#x27;s freezer, with the cone and the ice cream frozen together as one item. He formed The Drumstick Company in 1931 to market the product, and in 1991 the company was purchased by Nestlé.

In 1959, Spica, an Italian ice cream manufacturer based in Naples, invented a process whereby the inside of the waffle cone was insulated from the ice cream by a layer of oil, sugar and chocolate. Spica registered the name Cornetto in 1960. Initial sales were poor, but in 1976 Unilever bought out Spica and began a mass-marketing campaign throughout Europe. Cornetto has since become one of the most popular ice creams in the world.

In 1979, a patent for a new packaging design by David Weinstein led to easier transportation of commercial ice cream cones. Weinstein&#x27;s design enabled the ice cream cone to be wrapped in a wax paper package. This made the cones more sanitary while also preventing the paper wrapper from peeling off during transportation, or from becoming stuck to the cone.

<text>Hymettus (), also Hymettos (; ; ), is a mountain range in the Athens area of Attica, East Central Greece. It is also colloquially known as &quot;Trellós&quot; (crazy) or &quot;Trellóvouno&quot; (crazy mountain); the latter originates from the French &quot;très long&quot; (very long) in awe of its winding length of 16 km, as used by French travelers during the occupation of Greece by the Ottomans. Hymettus was assigned the status of a protected area in the EU&#x27;s Natura 2000 ecological network.

==Geography==
The highest point of the mountain range is Evzonas (Εύζωνας) with an elevation of . The length of Hymettus stretches from Athens to the Saronic Gulf. It is 6 to 7 km from east to west. In ancient times, the highest point was known as Megas Hymettos and the southern peaks as Elasson (Ἐλάσσων &quot;lesser, smaller&quot;) and Anydros Hymettos (Ἄνυδρος Ὑμηττός, &quot;waterless Hymettos&quot;). Today the southern peaks are called Mavrovouni (Μαυροβούνι, &quot;black mountain&quot;) and Kontra (Κόντρα). It was noted for its thyme honey. Marble has been quarried since antiquity. The neighboring communities that surround the mountain are Athens (proper), Zografou, Kaisariani, Vyronas, Ilissia (a region of Zografou), Ymittos, Ilioupoli, Argyroupoli, Elliniko, Glyfada, Voula and Vouliagmeni in the west, Varkiza, Vari, Markopoulo and Paiania to its east, and Papagou, Cholargos, Agia Paraskevi, Gerakas and Glyka Nera. Most of the forest is in the north, and much of the mountain is rocky, deforested, grassy and made out of limestone.

The flanks of Hymettos are dotted with caves. The largest and most notable is , which has its entrance on the east flank of the mountain, near Paiania. The smaller Liontari cave has its mouth at the north end of the mountain, west of Glyka Nera and is named after the lion of Hymettos which is said to have lived on the mountain in the past and to have terrified the inhabitants of the surrounding area.

==Monuments==
In antiquity there was a sanctuary to &quot;Zeus Ombrios&quot; (&quot;Zeus rain bringer&quot;) on the summit with numerous offerings dating especially to the 8th-7th centuries BC; they are on the site of a military base and not currently accessible. There is also an ancient quarryman&#x27;s hut on the western slopes of the mountain, one of two buildings in ancient Attica which preserves its roof.

There are several notable Byzantine monasteries on the mountain, including:
* Kaisariani Monastery, founded in the 2nd century AD and built into the flank of the mountain, incorporating the ruins of an ancient church. The monastery reached its peak in the 12th and 13th centuries, when it was a political and spiritual centre.
* Monastery of St. John the Theologian, located between Cholargos and Papagou.
* , established on the northern peak of Hymettos in the 12th century.
* , located on the west flank of Hymettos near the village of .
* , located on the northwestern flank of Hymettos, to the west of Kaisariani.

==Urban uses==
Major campuses of the University of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens (collectively called &quot;University Town&quot;) are located on the west-facing slope, between the A62 motorway, a ring road connected with the A6, and the urban sprawl of Athens. A transmitter park for several major TV and radio stations, along with military radar is located at the top of the mountain. Built up urban areas almost surround the entire mountain range. Access to the top of the mountain is restricted to authorized vehicles for maintenance of the towers.

Almost all of Attica, Athens&#x27; eastern suburbs and the new airport can be seen from the mountain top along with the mountains of Parnitha to its northwest, Penteli to its north and Aigaleo to its west. The valley areas that create the lowest passes are to the south and one further south.

The mountain range features about six to seven landfills in the western part and another in the eastern part.

<text>Fused quartz, fused silica or quartz glass is a glass consisting of almost pure silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2) in amorphous (non-crystalline) form. This differs from all other commercial glasses, such as soda-lime glass, lead glass, or borosilicate glass, in which other ingredients are added which change the glasses&#x27; optical and physical properties, such as lowering the melt temperature, the spectral transmission range, or the mechanical strength. Fused quartz, therefore, has high working and melting temperatures, making it difficult to form and less desirable for most common applications, but is much stronger, more chemically resistant, and exhibits lower thermal expansion, making it more suitable for many specialized uses such as lighting and scientific applications.

The terms &quot;fused quartz&quot; and &quot;fused silica&quot; are used interchangeably but can refer to different manufacturing techniques, resulting in different trace impurities. However fused quartz, being in the glassy state, has quite different physical properties compared to crystalline quartz despite being made of the same substance. Due to its physical properties it finds specialty uses in semiconductor fabrication and laboratory equipment, for instance.

Compared to other common glasses, the optical transmission of pure silica extends well into the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, so is used to make lenses and other optics for these wavelengths. Depending on manufacturing processes, impurities will restrict the optical transmission, resulting in commercial grades of fused quartz optimized for use in the infrared, or in the ultraviolet. The low coefficient of thermal expansion of fused quartz makes it a useful material for precision mirror substrates or optical flats.

== Manufacture ==

Fused quartz is produced by fusing (melting) high-purity silica sand, which consists of quartz crystals. There are four basic types of commercial silica glass:
* Type I is produced by induction melting natural quartz in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere.
* Type II is produced by fusing quartz crystal powder in a high-temperature flame.
* Type III is produced by burning SiCl4 in a hydrogen-oxygen flame.
* Type IV is produced by burning SiCl4 in a water vapor-free plasma flame.
Quartz contains only silicon and oxygen, although commercial quartz glass often contains impurities. Two dominant impurities are aluminium and titanium which affect the optical transmission at ultraviolet wavelengths. If water is present in the manufacturing process, hydroxyl (OH) groups may become embedded which reduces transmission in the infrared.

==Fusion==
Melting is effected at approximately 2200 °C (4000 °F) using either an electrically heated furnace (electrically fused) or a gas/oxygen-fuelled furnace (flame-fused). Fused silica can be made from almost any silicon-rich chemical precursor, usually using a continuous process which involves flame oxidation of volatile silicon compounds to silicon dioxide, and thermal fusion of the resulting dust (although alternative processes are used). This results in a transparent glass with an ultra-high purity and improved optical transmission in the deep ultraviolet. One common method involves adding silicon tetrachloride to a hydrogen–oxygen flame.

==Product quality==
Fused quartz is normally transparent. The material can, however, become translucent if small air bubbles are allowed to be trapped within. The water content (and therefore infrared transmission) of fused quartz is determined by the manufacturing process. Flame-fused material always has a higher water content due to the combination of the hydrocarbons and oxygen fueling the furnace, forming hydroxyl [OH] groups within the material. An IR grade material typically has an [OH] content below 10 ppm.

==Applications==
Many optical applications of fused quartz exploit its wide transparency range, which can extend well into the ultraviolet and into the near-mid infrared. Fused quartz is the key starting material for optical fiber, used for telecommunications.

Because of its strength and high melting point (compared to ordinary glass), fused quartz is used as an envelope for halogen lamps and high-intensity discharge lamps, which must operate at a high envelope temperature to achieve their combination of high brightness and long life. Some high-power vacuum tubes used silica envelopes whose good transmission at infrared wavelengths facilitated radiation cooling of their incandescent anodes.

Because of its physical strength, fused quartz was used in deep diving vessels such as the bathysphere and benthoscope and in the windows of crewed spacecraft, including the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. Fused quartz was used also in composite armour development.

In the semiconductor industry, its combination of strength, thermal stability, and UV transparency makes it an excellent substrate for projection masks for photolithography. Its UV transparency also finds use as windows on EPROMs (erasable programmable read only memory), a type of non-volatile memory chip which is erased by exposure to strong ultraviolet light. EPROMs are recognizable by the transparent fused quartz (although some later models use UV-transparent resin) window which sits on top of the package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which transmits UV light for erasing.

Due to the thermal stability and composition, it is used in 5D optical data storage and in semiconductor fabrication furnaces.

Fused quartz has nearly ideal properties for fabricating first surface mirrors such as those used in telescopes. The material behaves in a predictable way and allows the optical fabricator to put a very smooth polish onto the surface and produce the desired figure with fewer testing iterations. In some instances, a high-purity UV grade of fused quartz has been used to make several of the individual uncoated lens elements of special-purpose lenses including the Zeiss 105 mm f/4.3 UV Sonnar, a lens formerly made for the Hasselblad camera, and the Nikon UV-Nikkor 105 mm f/4.5 (presently sold as the Nikon PF10545MF-UV) lens. These lenses are used for UV photography, as the quartz glass can be transparent at much shorter wavelengths than lenses made with more common flint or crown glass formulas.

Fused quartz can be metallised and etched for use as a substrate for high-precision microwave circuits, the thermal stability making it a good choice for narrowband filters and similar demanding applications. The lower dielectric constant than alumina allows higher impedance tracks or thinner substrates.

===Refractory material applications===
Fused quartz as an industrial raw material is used to make various refractory shapes such as crucibles, trays, shrouds, and rollers for many high-temperature thermal processes including steelmaking, investment casting, and glass manufacture. Refractory shapes made from fused quartz have excellent thermal shock resistance and are chemically inert to most elements and compounds, including virtually all acids, regardless of concentration, except hydrofluoric acid, which is very reactive even in fairly low concentrations. Translucent fused-quartz tubes are commonly used to sheathe electric elements in room heaters, industrial furnaces, and other similar applications.

Owing to its low mechanical damping at ordinary temperatures, it is used for high-Q resonators, in particular, for wine-glass resonator of hemispherical resonator gyro. For the same reason fused quartz is also the material used for modern glass instruments such as the glass harp and the verrophone, and is also used for new builds of the historical glass harmonica, giving these instruments a greater dynamic range and a clearer sound than with the historically used lead crystal.

Quartz glassware is occasionally used in chemistry laboratories when standard borosilicate glass cannot withstand high temperatures or when high UV transmission is required. The cost of production is significantly higher, limiting its use; it is usually found as a single basic element, such as a tube in a furnace, or as a flask, the elements in direct exposure to the heat.

==Properties of fused quartz==
The extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, about (20–320 °C), accounts for its remarkable ability to undergo large, rapid temperature changes without cracking (see thermal shock).
Fused quartz is prone to phosphorescence and &quot;solarisation&quot; (purplish discoloration) under intense UV illumination, as is often seen in flashtubes. &quot;UV grade&quot; synthetic fused silica (sold under various tradenames including &quot;HPFS&quot;, &quot;Spectrosil&quot;, and &quot;Suprasil&quot;) has a very low metallic impurity content making it transparent deeper into the ultraviolet. An optic with a thickness of 1 cm has a transmittance around 50% at a wavelength of 170 nm, which drops to only a few percent at 160 nm. However, its infrared transmission is limited by strong water absorptions at 2.2 μm and 2.7 μm.

&quot;Infrared grade&quot; fused quartz (tradenames &quot;Infrasil&quot;, &quot;Vitreosil IR&quot;, and others), which is electrically fused, has a greater presence of metallic impurities, limiting its UV transmittance wavelength to around 250 nm, but a much lower water content, leading to excellent infrared transmission up to 3.6 μm wavelength. All grades of transparent fused quartz/fused silica have nearly identical mechanical properties.

===Refractive index===
The optical dispersion of fused quartz can be approximated by the following Sellmeier equation:

:formula_1
where the wavelength formula_2 is measured in micrometers. This equation is valid between 0.21 and 3.71 μm and at 20 °C. Its validity was confirmed for wavelengths up to 6.7 μm. Experimental data for the real (refractive index) and imaginary (absorption index) parts of the complex refractive index of fused quartz reported in the literature over the spectral range from 30 nm to 1000 μm have been reviewed by Kitamura &quot;et al.&quot; and are available online.

Its quite high Abbe Number of 67.8 makes it among the lowest dispersion glasses at visible wavelengths, as well as having an exceptionally low refractive index in the visible (&quot;n&quot;d = 1.4585). Note that fused quartz has a very different and lower refractive index compared to crystalline quartz which is birefringent with refractive indices &quot;n&quot;o = 1.5443 and &quot;n&quot;e = 1.5534 at the same wavelength. Although these forms have the same chemical formula, their differing structures result in different optical and other physical properties.

<text>Eric Scott Hinske (born August 5, 1977) is an American professional baseball coach and former outfielder and first baseman. Hinske played in the major leagues from 2002 to 2013 with the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Tampa Bay Rays, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and Arizona Diamondbacks at third base, first base, left field, and right field. He won the AL Rookie of the Year Award with the Blue Jays. He has also been a coach for the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Angels.

==Amateur career ==
Born in Menasha, Wisconsin, Hinske played for Menasha High School where he broke many hitting records, in addition to playing football as a running back. He initially intended to play football and baseball at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, which was 15 minutes from his home.

The University of Arkansas ultimately offered him a full scholarship to play baseball. Between 1996 and 1998, he hit .345 during his time at Arkansas. He also ranked within the top 10 in school history for several offensive categories, including RBI, runs scored, and extra base hits. In 1997, Hinske set a school record with 87 runs scored.

In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs===
The Chicago Cubs selected Hinske in the 17th round of the 1998 amateur draft. He began his professional career in Short Season A-ball with the Williamsport Cubs of the New York-Penn League. After hitting .298 with nine home runs and 57 RBI over 68 games, he moved over to the Rockford Cubbies of the Midwest League. 

Hinske spent most of the 1999 season in High-A with the Daytona Cubs of the Florida State League. He had an All-Star year, hitting .259 with 20 home runs and 73 RBI in 131 games. In 2000, Hinske played for the West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx in Double-A. He hit .259 with 20 home runs and 73 RBI in 131 games for the Southern League champions. 

===Oakland Athletics===
The Oakland Athletics acquired Hinske from the Cubs for Miguel Cairo on March 28, 2001. Hinske was assigned to Triple-A Sacramento for the 2001 season. He hit .282 with 25 home runs, 20 stolen bases, and 79 RBI in 121 for the River Cats.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On December 7, 2001, Toronto Blue Jays general manager J. P. Ricciardi acquired Hinske and reliever Justin Miller from the Athletics for Billy Koch, a move designed to bring youth and vitality to the team.

Hinske was inserted in the everyday lineup in 2002, playing third base. While criticized early for his defense, he made up for it with his bat, hitting .279 with 24 home runs, 13 stolen bases, and 84 RBI. He is one of three rookies in Blue Jays history to hit 21 or more home runs, along with J. P. Arencibia (23 in 2011) and Rowdy Tellez (21 in 2019). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 22. Hinske won the MLB Rookie of the Year and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year awards.

Following Hinske&#x27;s successful 2002 campaign, the Blue Jays signed him to a five-year, $14.75 million contract in March 2003. He struggled during the first two months of the season, hitting just .230 with two home runs through May 23. Hinske was finally diagnosed with a broken hamate bone in his right hand and underwent surgery, missing a month of playing time. As a result, he was unable to match his numbers of the previous year, finishing with an average of .243, 12 home runs and 63 RBI in 2003.

Hinske was still unable to return to his rookie form in 2004, finishing the year with a batting average of .246, with 15 home runs and 69 RBI. A positive note for Hinske was that he had committed a career-low seven errors at third base and led all third baseman in fielding percentage (.978). After the season, the Blue Jays were said to be looking to trade Hinske. Instead, the team ultimately acquired third basemen Corey Koskie and Shea Hillenbrand, and moved Hinske to first base. He started the 2005 season strong with a .290 batting average, six home runs, and 25 RBI through the end of May. However, he hit just .247 with nine home runs and 43 RBI the rest of the way.

Toronto acquired Lyle Overbay and Troy Glaus after the 2005 season, forcing Hinske to shift to the outfield. He began the 2006 season in a platoon with Alex Ríos in right field, before the latter won the job after a solid April. Hinske gained playing time when Rios was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a staph infection suffered after fouling a ball off his leg. Following the high-profile exit of Hillenbrand in July, Hinske gained even more opportunity to play.

===Boston Red Sox===

On August 17, 2006, Hinske was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a minor league player to be named later and cash considerations. His versatility helped the Red Sox, since they were greatly plagued by injuries in the second half of the season. He played first base and both corner outfield positions, and hit .342 in the last month of the season.

On May 17, 2007, Hinske had what could be considered the highlight of his Red Sox career against the Detroit Tigers. In the 5th inning of the game, Mike Rabelo hit a fly ball that seemed destined to find a hole.in right field. However, Hinske made a full-body diving catch, hitting the warning track face first. Later, in the bottom of the 7th inning, he would hit a go-ahead two-run home run. Hinske hit below his career norms with a .204 batting average and a .733 OPS in 84 games that year. He was included on the Red Sox playoff roster and received his first World Series ring with them.

===Tampa Bay Rays===

On February 6, 2008, Hinske signed a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Tampa Bay Rays. He was added to the 40-man major league roster on March 29, and was the Rays opening-day right-fielder. In his Rays debut, Hinske homered to right field off Baltimore starter Jeremy Guthrie. 

On July 29, Hinske hit his 100th career home run off former Toronto Blue Jays teammate Roy Halladay. There was controversy as to whether or not it was an inside the park home run. It was later officially ruled a traditional home run, after it was thought to have hit an awning in center field. On the final day of the regular season, Hinske hit his 20th home run, drove in his 60th run, and stole his 10th base of the year. It was the first time he had hit twenty home runs since his rookie year of 2002, and the first time he had stolen ten bases or more since the 2004 season.

Hinske was on the team&#x27;s initial playoff roster but did not play in the American League Division Series and was replaced by Edwin Jackson for the ALCS. Prior to Game 4 of the World Series, Hinske was added to the Rays&#x27; roster, replacing the injured Cliff Floyd. In the fifth inning of Game 4, Hinske hit an estimated 410-foot pinch-hit home run to center field off Philadelphia starter Joe Blanton. He made the final out of the World Series, striking out against Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge in Game 5.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===

On January 30, 2009, Hinske signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates worth $1.5 million. He missed time in spring training after injuring his rib cage running into the outfield wall. Hinske played 54 games for the team, batting .255 with 11 RBI and 17 walks mostly off the bench.

===New York Yankees===

On June 30, Hinske was traded from the Pirates to the New York Yankees in exchange for Eric Fryer and Casey Erickson. With New York he hit .226 with seven home runs in 84 at-bats over 39 games. Hinske was included in the Yankees&#x27; initial postseason roster for the first round of the 2009 American League Division Series. He was replaced by pinch runner Freddy Guzman for the 2009 American League Championship Series, but returned to the roster for the World Series. This marked his third straight World Series appearance with his third different team, all from the AL East. Additionally, the Yankees win gave him his second World Series ring.

===Atlanta Braves===

On January 5, 2010, it was reported that Hinske signed a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Atlanta Braves. In his first Braves at-bat he hit a triple. He hit his first home run as a Brave on May 16. With the Braves fighting for the NL Wild Card spot over the last week of the season, Hinske delivered a clutch go-ahead, two-run home run against the Marlins on September 29. Over the season, he appeared in 131 games, hitting .256 with 11 home runs and 51 RBI. He hit three home runs and drove in 12 runs as a pinch-hitter. 

He made it to the postseason for the fourth straight year and hit a dramatic go-ahead, pinch-hit, two-run home run in the eighth inning of Game 3 of the NLDS against the San Francisco Giants. However, the Braves ultimately lost the game and were eliminated in four games. 

On December 2, the Braves re-signed Hinske to a one-year deal with an option for 2012. He was primarily used as a bat off the bench and played the corner outfield positions. On June 3, 2011, Hinske hit a go-ahead solo homer off Mets closer Francisco Rodriguez to help the Braves win 6–3 He hit .233 with 10 home runs and 28 RBI that year, hitting .310 with runners in scoring position and two outs.

The Braves picked up their option on Hinske for the 2012 season. On May 5, he went 4–4 against the Colorado Rockies, including a tie-breaking two-run homer in the 11th inning. On May 11, Hinske was ejected by umpire Mike Muchlinski after Muchlinski ruled that Hinske had not checked his swing and was out on strikes. He made just two starts after the All-Star break and hit .197 with two home runs and 13 RBI in 132 at-bats for the Braves that year.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On December 4, 2012, Hinske signed a one-year deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After passing a physical, the contract became official on December 6, 2012. Hinske was suspended for five games for his actions during a brawl between the Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 11, 2013. The suspension was later reduced to only one game. After hitting .173 with one home run and six RBI in 52 games, he was designated for assignment on June 28.

==Scouting and coaching==
Following the 2013 season, Hinske was hired as a scout by the Yankees. He helped convince Brian McCann to sign with the team. After a month with the organization, he was hired by the Chicago Cubs to be their first base coach on December 3, 2013. After the 2014 season, the Yankees considered naming Hinske the team&#x27;s next hitting coach. However, he ultimately stayed with Chicago and was named assistant hitting coach. In 2016, Hinske won his third World Series ring when the Cubs defeated the Indians in the 2016 World Series. 

He was hired by the Los Angeles Angels on October 23, 2017, to be their hitting coach. After one season, he was replaced by Jeremy Reed. He was hired as the assistant hitting coach by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2019. On June 10, 2021, Hinske and hitting coach Darnell Coles were relieved of their positions with the club. 

On January 3, 2023, the New York Mets announced that Hinske was hired to be the team&#x27;s assistant hitting coach for the 2023 season. He was not retained for the 2024 season following the hiring of Carlos Mendoza as Mets manager.

==Personal life==
Hinske and wife Kathryn have three children, Ava, Dylan, and A.J. In 2016, Hinske&#x27;s hometown Menasha honored his professional achievements by dedicating a street in his name.

Hinske enjoys listening to metal music, and his walk-up song was &quot;Walk&quot; by Pantera. Hinske has a large set of tattoos incorporating Japanese iconography that completely cover his back.

<text>Gertrude Berg (born Tillie Edelstein; October 3, 1899 – September 14, 1966) was an American actress, screenwriter, and producer. A pioneer of classic radio, she was one of the first women to create, write, produce, and star in a long-running hit when she premiered her serial comedy-drama &quot;The Rise of the Goldbergs&quot; (1929), later known as &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;. Her career achievements included winning a Tony Award and an Emmy Award, both for Best Lead Actress.

==Life and career==
Berg was born Tillie Edelstein in 1899 in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, to Jacob and Dinah Edelstein, natives of Russia and England, respectively. Berg&#x27;s chronically unstable mother Dinah, grieving over the death of her young son, experienced a series of nervous breakdowns and later died in a sanitarium.

Tillie, who lived with her family on Lexington Avenue, married Lewis Berg in 1918; they had two children, Cherney (1922–2003) and Harriet (1926–2003). She learned theater while producing skits at her father&#x27;s Catskills Mountains resort in Fleischmanns, New York.

After the sugar factory where her husband worked burned down, she developed a semi-autobiographical skit, portraying a Jewish family in a Bronx tenement, into a radio show. Though the household had a typewriter, Berg wrote her script by hand, taking the pages this way to a long-awaited appointment at NBC. When the executive she was meeting with protested that he could not read what Berg had written, she read the script aloud to him. Her performance not only sold the idea for the radio program but also got Berg the job as the lead actress on the program she had written. Berg continued to write the show&#x27;s scripts by hand in pencil for as long as the program was on the air.

On November 20, 1929, a 15-minute episode of &quot;The Rise of the Goldbergs&quot; was first broadcast on the NBC radio network. She started at US$75 a week. Less than two years later, in the heart of the Great Depression, she let the sponsor propose a salary and was told, &quot;Mrs. Berg, we can&#x27;t pay a cent over $2,000 a week.&quot; Berg&#x27;s husband, Lewis—who became a successful consulting engineer, though his job loss prompted her to write the initial radio script—refused to be photographed with his wife for publicity purposes, as he felt this was infringing on her success.
Berg became inextricably identified as Molly Goldberg, the big-hearted matriarch of her fictional Bronx family who moved to Connecticut as a symbol of upward mobility of American Jews. She wrote nearly all the show&#x27;s radio episodes (more than 5,000) plus a Broadway adaptation, &quot;Me and Molly&quot; (1948). It took considerable convincing, but Berg finally prevailed upon CBS to let her bring &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; to television in 1949. Early episodes portrayed the Goldberg family openly and personally struggling to adapt to American life. Just as Berg stated in her autobiography, she chose to depict her Jewish grandfather&#x27;s worship in her first radio broadcast show. Her characters Molly, Jake, Sammy and Rosie emphasized her day-to-day stories of Jewish immigration to America.

Immigrant life and the Goldberg family struggle were familiar and relatable to many families during this point in American history. Radio seemed to produce a common place to tie patriotism and families together. The program&#x27;s success was largely because of the familiar feelings of the American people portrayed in the program&#x27;s scripts. The first season script was later published in book form.

In 1951, Berg won the first ever Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Television Series in her twentieth year of playing the role. The show would stay in production for five more years.

&quot;The Goldbergs&quot; ran into trouble in 1951, during the McCarthy Era. Co-star Philip Loeb (Molly&#x27;s husband, patriarch Jake Goldberg) was one of the performers named in &quot;Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television&quot; and blacklisted as a result. The series was canceled as a result of Loeb&#x27;s participation, and both network and sponsors insisted Loeb be fired as a condition of the show returning to air, despite Berg&#x27;s protests. Loeb resigned rather than cause Berg trouble. He reportedly received a generous severance package from the show, but it did not prevent him from sinking into a depression that ultimately drove him to suicide in 1955. &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; returned a year after Loeb departed the show and continued until 1954, after which Berg also wrote and produced a syndicated film version. The show remained in syndicated reruns for another few years, after one year of production and 39 episodes (it aired on some stations as &quot;Molly&quot;). The series is currently seen on the Jewish Life Television (JLTV) cable network.
Berg continued to make guest appearances on television in the 1950s and early 1960s. She appeared on &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, a February 1958 episode of &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, and was the &quot;mystery guest&#x27;&quot; on the series &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1954, 1960, and 1961. In 1961, Berg made a last stab at television success in the Four Star Television situation comedy, &quot;Mrs. G. Goes to College&quot; (retitled &quot;The Gertrude Berg Show&quot; at midseason), playing a 62-year-old widow who enrolls in college. The series was cancelled after one season.

Berg continued working in theatre through these years. In 1959, she won the Tony Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;A Majority of One&quot;. In 1961, Berg won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theater. Berg also published a best-selling memoir, &quot;Molly and Me&quot;, in 1961.

==Death and legacy==
Berg died of heart failure on September 14, 1966, aged 66, at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. She is buried at Clovesville Cemetery in Fleischmanns, New York.

A biography of Berg, &quot;Something on My Own: Gertrude Berg and American Broadcasting&quot;, 1929–1956, by Glenn D. Smith, Jr. (Syracuse University Press) appeared in 2007. Aviva Kempner&#x27;s 2009 documentary, &quot;Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg&quot;, deals with Berg&#x27;s career, and to an extent, her personal life.

<text>Fordham University () is a private Jesuit research university in New York City, United States. Established in 1841 and named after the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx in which its original campus is located, Fordham is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the northeastern United States and the third-oldest university in New York State.

Founded as St. John&#x27;s College by John Hughes, then a coadjutor bishop of New York, the college was placed in the care of the Society of Jesus shortly thereafter, and has since become a Jesuit-affiliated independent school under a lay board of trustees. While governed independently of the church since 1969, every president of Fordham University between 1846 and 2022 was a Jesuit priest, and the curriculum remains influenced by Jesuit educational principles.

Fordham enrolls approximately 15,300 students from more than 65 countries, and is composed of ten constituent colleges, four of which are undergraduate and six of which are postgraduate, across three campuses in southern New York State: the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx, the Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side, and the Westchester campus in West Harrison, New York. The university also maintains a study abroad center in London and field offices in Spain and South Africa. The university offers degrees in over 60 disciplines.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams, the Rams, include a football team that boasted a win in the Sugar Bowl, two Pro Football Hall of Famers, two All-Americans, two Canadian Football League All-Stars, and numerous NFL players; the Rams also participated in history&#x27;s first televised college football game in 1939 and history&#x27;s first televised college basketball game in 1940. Fordham&#x27;s baseball team played the first collegiate baseball game under modern rules in 1859, has fielded 56 major league players, and holds the record for most NCAA Division I baseball victories in history.

Fordham&#x27;s alumni and faculty include current President Donald Trump, U.S. Senators and representatives, four cardinals of the Catholic Church, several U.S. governors and ambassadors, a number of billionaires, two directors of the CIA, Academy Award and Emmy-winning actors, royalty, a foreign head of state, a White House Counsel, a vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army, a U.S. Postmaster General, a U.S. Attorney General, a President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the first female vice presidential candidate of a major political party in the United States.

== History ==

=== 1841–1900: Establishment and early years ===
Fordham was founded as St. John&#x27;s College in 1841 by the Irish-born coadjutor bishop (later archbishop) of the Diocese of New York, John Hughes. It is the third-oldest university in the state of New York, and the first Catholic institution of higher education in the northeastern United States. In 1839, Hughes, then 42 years old, had purchased the 106-acre Rose Hill Manor farm in the village of Fordham, New York, for $29,750. His intent was to establish St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary following the model of Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University, of which he was an alumnus. &quot;Rose Hill&quot; was the name originally given to the site in 1787 by its owner, Robert Watts, a wealthy New York merchant, in honor of his family&#x27;s ancestral home in Scotland.

In 1840, St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary opened at Rose Hill. The seminary was paired with St. John&#x27;s College, which opened at Rose Hill with a student body of six on June 24, 1841, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. The Reverend John McCloskey (later archbishop of New York and eventually the first American cardinal) was the school&#x27;s first president, and the faculty were secular priests and lay instructors. The college presidency went through a succession of four diocesan priests in five years, including the Rev. James Roosevelt Bayley, a distant cousin of Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt and a nephew of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. In 1845, the seminary church, Our Lady of Mercy, was built. The same year, Bishop Hughes convinced several Jesuit priests from the St. Mary&#x27;s College in Kentucky to staff St. John&#x27;s.
The college received its charter from the New York State Legislature in 1846, and the first Jesuits began to arrive about three months later. In the same year Bishop Hughes sold St. John&#x27;s College to the Jesuits for $40,000. Hughes deeded the college over but retained title to the seminary property, which totaled about nine acres. In 1847, Fordham&#x27;s first school in Manhattan opened. The school became the independently chartered College of St. Francis Xavier in 1861. It was also in 1847 that the American poet Edgar Allan Poe arrived in the village of Fordham and began a friendship with the college Jesuits that would last throughout his life. In 1849, he published his famed work &quot;The Bells&quot;. Some traditions credit the college&#x27;s church bells as the inspiration for this poem. Poe also spent considerable time in the college&#x27;s library, and even occasionally stayed overnight.

St. John&#x27;s curriculum consisted of a junior division (which would become Fordham Prep), requiring four years of study in Latin, Greek, grammar, literature, history, geography, mathematics, and religion; and a senior division (i.e. the college), requiring three years study in &quot;poetry&quot; (humanities), rhetoric, and philosophy. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, famed commander of the all-black 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry American Civil War regiment, attended the junior division. An &quot;Artium Baccalaureus&quot; degree was earned for completion of both curricula, and an additional year of philosophy would earn a &quot;Magister Artium&quot; degree. There was also a &quot;commercial&quot; track similar to a modern business school, offered as an alternative to the Classical curriculum and resulting in a certificate instead of a degree. In 1855, the first student stage production, &quot;Henry IV&quot;, was presented by the St. John&#x27;s Dramatic Society. The seminary was closed in 1859.

The Civil War was a significant time for the college; among its alumni were four generals, six colonels (including Shaw), and five captains serving in the Union Army; twelve men from Fordham also served in the Confederate Army. Three Jesuits from St. John&#x27;s served as army chaplains. Lincoln&#x27;s assassination deeply affected the student body, and even southern students attending the college mourned his loss. As Richard S. Treacy of the class of 1869 later recalled, &quot;The morning we received the news of the death of President Lincoln gloom settled over the entire college, even the southern boys, who before had censored him, now felt that they had lost a valuable friend whose great qualities would be missed in the coming reconstruction.&quot;

Fordham&#x27;s baseball team, which played its first game on September 13, 1859, made several contributions to the history of baseball in the nineteenth century, and played a key role in introducing the game to Cuba and Latin America. On November 3, 1859, Fordham played the first college baseball game with modern nine-man teams against the now-defunct St. Francis Xavier College in Manhattan. Fordham won the game 33–11. Steve Bellán, the first Cuban and Latin American to play major league baseball, learned to play the game while a student at Fordham from 1863 to 1868. After playing for several American major league teams, he returned home and played in the first organized baseball game in Cuba on December 27, 1874. Charles, Henry, and Frederick Zaldo, brothers from Havana who founded the Almendares Baseball Club, one of the three original Cuban baseball teams, also learned the game while attending Fordham from 1875 to 1878.

An Act of Congress created instruction in military science and tactics at the college level. As a result of the act, St. John&#x27;s brought a cadet corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.

===1901–1950: Maturation===
On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York consented to allow the board of trustees to authorize the opening of a law school and a medical school. St. John&#x27;s College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name &quot;Fordham&quot; refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the Bronx River (&quot;ford by the hamlet&quot;). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into Bronx County at the turn of the twentieth century, the village became the borough&#x27;s Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just to the west of the Rose Hill campus.

In 1908, Fordham University Press was established. In 1912, the university opened the College of Pharmacy, which offered a three-year program in pharmacy, not requiring its students to obtain bachelor&#x27;s degrees until the late 1930s. The college had a mainly Jewish student body, and in recognition of that, the students were exempted from Catholic theology instruction. In September 1912, the Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung delivered a series of lectures at Fordham; these lectures marked his historic break with the theories of his colleague, Sigmund Freud.
The College of St. Francis Xavier was closed in 1913, and various Fordham colleges were opened at the Woolworth Building in Manhattan to fill the void. Some divisions of the university including the law school were later moved to the City Hall Campus at &quot;the Vincent Astor Building&quot; at 302 Broadway. This commenced an unbroken string of instruction in Manhattan that became what is now Fordham College at Lincoln Center, where all of Fordham&#x27;s academic operations in Manhattan are centered today.

The university closed its medical school in 1919, citing a lack of endowment and reduced university funds overall due to the First World War. The Gabelli School of Business began in 1920 in Manhattan as the School of Accounting. According to a university catalogue from 1920, the annual cost for tuition, room and board at the college was $600 (). In 1944, the School of Professional and Continuing Studies was established, largely bolstered by returning veterans taking advantage of the GI Bill.

The football program was established in 1882 and gained national renown in the early 20th century. Fordham football played on some of the largest stages in sports, including games in front of sellout crowds at the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium, a Cotton Bowl appearance and a Sugar Bowl victory. The program produced the famed Seven Blocks of Granite, one of whom was the great Vince Lombardi. On September 30, 1939, Fordham participated in the world&#x27;s first televised football game, defeating Waynesburg College, 34–7. The university discontinued the program during World War II, reinstating it in 1946. However, it proved much less successful and too expensive to maintain, and was again discontinued in 1954, though would revive yet again as an NCAA Division III team in 1970 and Division I team in 1989.

The 1940s bore witness to two official presidential visits at Fordham, the first by president Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 28, 1940, during his campaign for a third term. The president was cheered by crowds lining the Grand Concourse as he rode to campus, but received a &quot;more measured welcome&quot; from university president Robert Gannon, who was known for his &quot;anti-Roosevelt views.&quot; However, in his welcoming remarks, Gannon respectfully referred to Roosevelt as &quot;a man whose imprint is forever fixed on our national history.&quot;

The second visit was by president Harry S. Truman on May 11, 1946, on the occasion of the centennial of the granting of Fordham&#x27;s charter. The president received an honorary degree and delivered a nationally broadcast address on the subject of veterans&#x27; education, the dangers of atomic warfare, and the importance of education to civilization. His address concluded with the words, &quot;I am confident that this splendid institution, with its educational system rounded [&quot;sic&quot;] upon Christian principles, will play a full and noble part in the great adventure ahead of us. We can and we must make the atomic age an age of peace for the glory of God and the welfare of mankind.&quot; During his visit, Truman also performed the first ringing of the Fordham &quot;victory bell,&quot; originally the ship&#x27;s bell of the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Junyo,&quot; which was presented to the university by Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The bell currently stands outside the Rose Hill Gymnasium and peals after all Ram athletic victories and at the start of Commencement each year.

=== 1951–2000: Clerical independence ===
On February 15, 1958, then-Senator John F. Kennedy received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from university president Laurence J. McGinley and delivered an address at the annual Fordham Law Alumni Association luncheon. After humorously stating that he denied any &quot;presidential aspirations—with respect to the Fordham Alumni Association,&quot; Kennedy said that, &quot;It is to the eternal credit of Fordham that the teaching of law has here been accompanied by an inculcation of moral values. The graduate of this law school has acquired something more than the tools of his profession—he has learned, both by example and precept, the high obligations of trust which are his as an attorney.&quot;

In 1961, the Lincoln Center campus opened as part of the Lincoln Square Renewal Project. This second campus which placed an institution of higher learning in the realm of a multi-disciplinary performing arts complex came to pass through the collaboration of New York City&#x27;s urban planner Robert Moses and Fordham&#x27;s twenty sixth President Fr. Laurence J. McGinley. The School of Law was the first to occupy the new campus, but the academic programs at 302 Broadway were moved to the new location in 1969. In addition, on November 18, 1961, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy received an honorary degree and delivered an address at the dedication of the new Fordham Law School building in Lincoln Center, paying tribute to &quot;Fordham ideals, traditions and teachers.&quot; Kennedy said that he was privileged, as attorney general, to be &quot;the largest single employer of Fordham law graduates in North America,&quot; and also remarked that, &quot;While the world we know is preoccupied by what may lie before it, when threats could pervade our every thought and fears our every action, it is reassuring to see buildings and programs like these rise each day to greet the future. It is a mark of courage and resolution.&quot; On November 2, 1964, during his campaign for the U.S. Senate, Robert F. Kennedy made another visit to Fordham and gave an address at the Rose Hill gymnasium that attracted a crowd of 2,800.

The first women to attend Fordham came earlier in the century: the Law School began accepting female students in 1918. Women also had been earning Fordham degrees at the Graduate School of Social Service and the Undergraduate School of Education, at the City Hall Campus. Women in the School of Education had also been commuting to the Rose Hill campus to take their science lab courses alongside male students, where women had also been part of the School of Pharmacy&#x27;s student body. However, in September 1964, the all-female Thomas More College at the Rose Hill campus began instruction for the BA and BS degrees.

In response to internal demands for a more &quot;liberalized&quot; curriculum, the university created Bensalem College in 1967. An experimental college with no set requirements and no grades, it was studied by a wide array of educators and covered by journalists at such large-circulation publications of the day as &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. The school closed in 1974.

&quot;The Liberal Arts College&quot; for undergraduates opened in 1968, later changing its name to &quot;The College at Lincoln Center&quot; and then in 1996 to &quot;Fordham College at Lincoln Center.&quot; In 1993, a twenty-story residence hall for 850 students was added to the Lincoln Center campus. 

In the late 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement was gathering momentum in the U.S. when Fordham students and school officials expressed ambivalence about racial justice. In the late 1960s, Fordham became a center of political activism and countercultural activity. At the Rose Hill Campus, the Fordham branch of Students for a Democratic Society organized opposition to the existence of the ROTC and military recruiters. During this period, students routinely organized protests and class boycotts and used psychoactive drugs on campus open spaces. In 1969, students organized a sit-in on the main road leading to Rose Hill in response to an announcement that President Richard Nixon would be speaking on campus. As a result of the sit-in, Nixon was forced to cancel his plans to speak. A year later, students stormed the main administration building, occupying it for several weeks, and set fire to the Rose Hill faculty lounge. It was during this period of activism that the university&#x27;s African and African American Studies Department, one of the first black studies departments in the nation, as well as &quot;the paper&quot;, the leftist student newspaper on campus, were founded.

The board of trustees was reorganized in 1969 to include a majority of nonclerical members, which officially made the university an independent institution. While the Jesuit order thereby lost full control of Fordham, the board of trustees continues to maintain the institution as a &quot;Jesuit, Catholic university.&quot; The College of Pharmacy closed in 1972 due to declining enrollment. Fordham College at Rose Hill became coeducational in 1974 when it merged with Thomas More College.

Fordham Preparatory School is a four-year, all-male college preparatory school that was once integrated with the university, sharing its 1841 founding. &quot;Fordham Prep&quot; became legally independent in 1972 when it moved to its own facilities on the northwest corner of the Rose Hill campus. The school continues to retain many connections with the university.

===2001–present: Post-millennium===
Marymount College was an independent women&#x27;s college that was founded in 1907 by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary. The school was consolidated into Fordham in July 2002. Marymount had been steeped in financial hardship since the 1970s. Located north of Manhattan in Tarrytown, New York, the college remained open as a single-sex institution, and its campus received a branch of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies as well as extensions of the graduate schools for education, social service, and business administration.

In 2005, Fordham announced that its Marymount College campus would be phased out; Marymount awarded degrees to its final undergraduate class in May 2007. University administrators indicated the campus would remain open for Fordham graduate programs in several disciplines.

In the autumn of 2007, the university announced its intention to seek buyers for the Marymount campus. Administrators stated the expenses required to support the programs at the campus far exceeded the demand. University officials estimated the revenue gained from the proposed sale would not be greater than the expenses incurred maintaining and improving the campus since the merger with Marymount. President McShane stated the university&#x27;s decision was nonetheless a &quot;painful&quot; one. Fordham then indicated its intention to move the remaining programs from the Marymount campus to a new location in Harrison, New York, by the autumn of 2008. On February 17, 2008, the university announced the sale of the campus for $27 million to EF Schools, a chain of private language-instruction schools.

In 2014, the university successfully completed a five-year, $500 million campaign; the project surpassed expectations by raising more than $540 million. The university went on to renovate and expand its Lincoln Center campus, opening in 2014 its renovated Law School, as well as an additional undergraduate dormitory, McKeon Hall. The former law school building was converted to expand Quinn Library and house the Gabelli School of Business. Long-term plans include a new library building and buildings for the graduate schools of Social Service and of Education.

==Campuses==

Fordham has three main campuses, which are in and around New York City: Rose Hill in the Fordham neighborhood, the Bronx, adjacent to Bronx Park on Fordham Road; Lincoln Center in Manhattan, one block from Central Park; and Westchester in West Harrison, New York. In addition, it maintains and utilizes various academic, extracurricular, and residential facilities throughout New York City and New York State and around the world. In addition to its three main campuses, the university also operates the Louis Calder Center, a biological field station north of New York City in Armonk, New York. It consists of forested with a lake and 13 buildings. The structures house laboratories and classrooms, offices for faculty and administrators, a library, and residences.

Outside the United States, the university maintains a small campus in London, known as the London Centre. In addition, Fordham operates field offices in Granada, Spain, and Pretoria, South Africa; these house undergraduate study abroad programs. Finally, the university provides faculty for the Beijing International MBA at Peking University at Peking University in China. The program, established in 1998, has been ranked No. 1 in China by &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot; Magazines.

===Rose Hill===
The Rose Hill campus, established in 1841 by Bishop John Hughes, is home to Fordham College at Rose Hill, the Gabelli School of Business, and a division of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, as well as the Graduate Schools of Arts and Sciences and Religion and Religious Education. Situated on in the central Bronx, it is among the largest privately owned green spaces in New York City. At one time spanning over 100 acres, much of the land for adjacent Bronx Park was acquired from the university with funds authorized by the 1884 New Parks Act intended to preserve lands that would soon become part of New York City, on the condition that it be used as a zoo and botanical garden. Fordham students and staff have free admission to the garden grounds. Rose Hill is on Fordham Road, just north of the Belmont neighborhood, described as the &quot;real Little Italy of New York&quot;, and immediately west of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Botanical Garden. The campus&#x27;s Collegiate Gothic architecture, expansive lawns, ivy-covered buildings, and cobblestone streets were featured by NBC News.

Rose Hill is largely made up of nineteenth-century architecture, with some contemporary buildings. The campus is home to several structures on the National Register of Historic Places, such as the University Church built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for the surrounding community. It contains the old altar from the current St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, as well as stained glass windows given to the university by King Louis Philippe I of France. The windows are particularly notable for their connection to a workshop in Sevres, France, locus of the earliest stages of the Gothic Revival. Adjacent to the church is a 138-plot cemetery where the university&#x27;s nineteenth-century Jesuits, diocesan seminarians, students, and workers are interred, relocated in 1890 from its original location at today&#x27;s New York Botanical Garden.

There are eleven residence halls on campus, including Queen&#x27;s Court residential college, whose main mission is to &quot;assist in the integration of first-year students into University life,&quot; and nine Integrated Learning Communities that each cater to a particular year (freshman, sophomore, etc.) or area of study (science, leadership, etc.). In addition, the campus contains two residences for Jesuits, a retirement home, and the Murray-Weigel infirmary.

Rose Hill is served by the Fordham station of the Metro-North Railroad, which extends to Grand Central Terminal. Public transit buses stop adjacent to campus exits, and three New York City Subway stations are within walking distance. The university also provides a shuttle service between its three main campuses (the &quot;Ram Van&quot;), which is headquartered at Rose Hill. 6,981 undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled at the Rose Hill, of which 2,482 live on campus.

===Lincoln Center===
In 1954, New York City&#x27;s Robert Moses wrote to Fordham administrators proposing Fordham might &quot;be interested in an alternative [to renting space in the New York Coliseum] involving a new building in a part of the area to the north of Columbus Circle to be redeveloped under Title One of the Federal Housing Law. ... If this idea appeals to you I will ask Mr. Lebwohl to see you and explain it in greater detail.&quot; In March 1958, Mayor Robert Wagner signed the deeds transferring the Lincoln Center campus to Fordham University.

The Lincoln Center campus is home to Fordham College at Lincoln Center and to a division of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, as well as the School of Law, the Graduate Schools of Education and Social Service, and the Gabelli School of Business. The campus occupies the area from West 60th Street to West 62nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, placing it in the cultural heart of Manhattan. 

Lincoln Center has two grassy plazas, built one level up from the street. The larger expanse was once a barren cement landscape known as &quot;Robert Moses Plaza;&quot; the smaller is known as &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Garden&quot; and contains a memorial to the Fordham students and alumni who perished in the September 11, 2001, attacks. The campus is served by public transit buses; the A, B, C, D, and 1 Subway trains, which are accessed at the 59th Street/Columbus Circle station; and the university&#x27;s Ram Van shuttle. 9,078 undergraduate and postgraduate students are enrolled at Lincoln Center, of which 1,337 reside in University housing. The campus consists of the Leon Lowenstein Building, McMahon Hall, the Gerald M. Quinn Library, and the Doyle Building. In the fall of 2014, the new freshman residence dormitory McKeon Hall opened, along with the new Fordham Law School building.

The &quot;Toward 2016 Strategic Plan&quot; prescribed a complete reconfiguration of the Lincoln Center campus, to be completed by 2032. The first phase of the project, including renovations of the Lowenstein Building as well as a new Law School building and residence hall designed by Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, were completed in 2014. In 2014, Fordham University purchased a building at 45 Columbus Avenue and incorporated it in its Lincoln Center campus as Joseph A. Martino Hall. The nine-story building is directly across the avenue from the former Law School building.

===Westchester===
The Westchester campus is home to divisions of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, the Martino Graduate School of Business Administration, and the Education and Social Service graduate schools. It consists of a three-story, building on landscaped with a stream and pond. Fordham signed a 20-year lease for the facility, which includes 26 &quot;smart&quot; classrooms, faculty and administrative offices, a media center, a food service facility, and indoor and outdoor meeting areas. In 2008, the university spent over $8 million renovating the building in order to increase its sustainability.

The campus is served by the White Plains station of the Metro-North Railroad away and connected by the Westchester County Bus System (&quot;The Bee Line&quot;).

===London Centre===
In October 2018, Fordham expanded its study abroad program in London to its own space, the London Centre. The campus is situated in the Clerkenwell area of London, within the London borough of Camden. Fordham&#x27;s London Centre offers programs in business, theater, and the liberal arts to students from Fordham and other colleges and universities.

===Town-gown relationships===
Relations between Fordham and its surrounding neighborhoods vary according to campus. At Rose Hill, the university actively recruits Bronx students from disadvantaged backgrounds through the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program. In addition, about 80% of students participate in local community service.

The relationship between the Lincoln Center campus and some of the Upper West Side community residents have been strained, over campus development. In 2010 the New York State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by The Alfred Condominium. The suit was filed in response to the university&#x27;s expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community. The Lincoln Center campus does, however, have a lively connection to the artistic scene in Manhattan through its dance and theater productions and visual art exhibitions.

==Academics==
Fordham University is composed of four undergraduate and six graduate schools, and its academic ethos is heavily drawn from its Jesuit origins. The university promotes the Jesuit principles of &quot;cura personalis&quot;, which fosters a faculty and administrative respect for the individual student and all of his or her gifts and abilities; &quot;magis&quot;, which encourages students to challenge themselves and strive for excellence in their lives; and &quot;homines pro aliis&quot;, which intends to inspire service, a universal charity, among members of the Fordham community.

Through its International and Study Abroad Programs (ISAP) Office, Fordham provides its students with over 130 different study abroad opportunities. The programs range in duration from six weeks to a full academic year and vary in focus from cultural and language immersion to internship and service learning. Some of the programs are organized by Fordham itself, such as those in London, United Kingdom; Granada, Spain; and Pretoria, South Africa; while others are operated by partner institutions like Georgetown University, the University of Oxford, and the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE). In addition to the ISAP programs, the university&#x27;s constituent schools offer a range of study abroad programs that cater to their specific areas of study. Fordham has produced 168 Fulbright scholars since 2003.

===Admissions===

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Fordham is considered a &quot;more selective&quot; university, while a 2013 &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; survey published in the &quot;New York Times&quot; classed the university as &quot;highly competitive&quot;. In its 2018 edition, admissions selectivity to Fordham&#x27;s undergraduate schools received a reclassification by &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; Profiles of American Colleges to &quot;Most Competitive&quot; after being &quot;Highly Competitive+&quot; in its 2017 edition, and reported 74% of enrolled freshmen as ranking in the top 20% of their high school class.

In 2016, the university accepted approximately 43% of all applicants across both its undergraduate and graduate programs. For the undergraduate class of 2019, Fordham accepted 20,366 of the 42,811 applicants (47.6%) and enrolled 2,211. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolled freshmen was 580–670 for critical reading, 590–680 for math, and 590–680 for writing, while the ACT Composite middle 50% range was 28–33. The average high school GPA of incoming freshmen was 3.64.

===Undergraduate curriculum===
All undergraduates pursuing bachelor&#x27;s degrees at Fordham are required to complete the Core curriculum, a distribution of 17 courses in nine disciplines: English, mathematical/computational reasoning, social science, philosophy and ethics, history, fine arts, religious studies, natural science, and modern or Classical languages. Based on the curriculum established by the Society of Jesus in the sixteenth century, the Core is shared by Jesuit schools all over the world and emphasizes the liberal arts as a basis of education.

Undergraduate students are expected to have finished most of the core requirements as a sophomore; a wide variety of courses can be applied to satisfy the requirements. Upon the completion of the Core Curriculum, students choose from approximately 50 major courses of study, in which they will receive their degree. One option is the &quot;personalized interdisciplinary major&quot;, which allows students to create their own course of study across various disciplines.

In addition to the bachelor&#x27;s degrees offered to undergraduates, the university also offers specialized academic programs, including pre-medical and health professions; pre-professional programs in architecture, law, and criminal justice; a 3-2 engineering program, in conjunction with Columbia and Case Western Reserve Universities; a five-year teacher certification program; an Applied Public Accountancy (CPA certification) program; a BFA program in dance, in conjunction with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; as well as cross-registration opportunities with the Juilliard School for advanced music students.

===Graduate programs===

Master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees are offered through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Law, the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Social Service, the Gabelli School of Business, and the Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education. Fordham&#x27;s graduate programs in business, education, English, history, law, psychology, and social work were all ranked among the top 100 in the nation by the 2016 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Fordham participates in the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium, which allows its doctoral students to take classes at a number of schools in the New York metropolitan area.

Fordham&#x27;s medical school officially closed in 1919, and its College of Pharmacy followed suit in 1972. Nevertheless, the university continues its tradition of medical education through a collaboration with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University. The partnership allows Fordham undergraduate and graduate science students to take classes, conduct research, and pursue early admission to select programs of Einstein. In addition, it involves a physician mentoring program, which permits students to shadow an attending physician at Einstein&#x27;s Montefiore Medical Center.

===Research===

The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The Fordham University Library System contains over 2.5 million volumes and 3.1 million microforms, subscribes to 16,000 periodicals including electronic access, and has 19,300 audiovisual materials. It is a depository for 363,227 United States Government documents. In addition, the university&#x27;s Interlibrary Loan office provides students and faculty with virtually unlimited access to the over 20 million volumes of the New York Public Library System as well as to media from the libraries of Columbia University, New York University, the City University of New York, and other libraries around the world. Fordham&#x27;s libraries include the William D. Walsh Family Library, ranked in 2004 as the fifth best collegiate library in the country, and the Science Library at the Rose Hill campus; the Gerald M. Quinn Library and the Leo T. Kissam Memorial Law Library at the Lincoln Center campus; and the Media Center at the Westchester campus. In addition to the university&#x27;s formal libraries, several academic departments, research institutes, and student organizations maintain their own literary collections. The Rose Hill campus&#x27;s Duane Library, despite its name, is no longer a library but offers reading and study space for students.

Fordham maintains several special collections housed in museums and galleries on campus. The Fordham Museum of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Art is at the Rose Hill campus and contains more than 200 artifacts from Classical antiquity, including: sculptures, mosaics, ceramics and pottery, coins, and inscriptions, among other items. A gift from alumnus William D. Walsh, it is the largest collection of its kind at any college or university in the New York metropolitan area. In addition, the university maintains an extensive art collection, which is housed in exhibition spaces at the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses and in galleries around New York City. Finally, the university possesses a sizable collection of rare books, manuscripts, and other print media, which is housed in the O&#x27;Hare Special Collections Room at the Walsh Library.

Other research facilities include the Louis Calder Center, a 114-acre biological field station and the middle site along an urban-forest transect known as the Urban-Rural Gradient Experiment; the William Spain Seismic Observatory, a data collection unit for the US Geological Survey; and other facilities. It is a member of the Bronx Scientific Research Consortium, which also includes the New York Botanical Garden, the Bronx Zoo, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, and Montefiore Medical Center. Furthermore, Fordham faculty have conducted research with such institutions as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and organizations worldwide.

Fordham University Press, the university&#x27;s publishing house and an affiliate of Oxford University Press, primarily publishes humanities and social sciences research. The university also hosts an Undergraduate Research Symposium every year during the spring semester and publishes the &quot;Undergraduate Research Journal&quot; in conjunction with the symposium. In addition, it facilitates research opportunities for undergraduates with such organizations as the National Science Foundation, The Cloisters, and the American Museum of Natural History.

===Honor societies and programs===
Fordham&#x27;s undergraduate schools all offer honors programs for their students. The programs&#x27; curricula are modified versions of the Core Curriculum. For example, the Fordham College Honors Program, a community of scholars for justice, offers a Great Books curriculum with seminar-style classes and a senior research thesis in each student&#x27;s major. Most honors students are inducted into the programs upon admission to the university, though some are invited at the end of their first year. Each program has a designated study space for its members, including Alpha House for the Fordham College Honors Program and the honors wing of Hughes Hall for the Global Business Honors Program. Upon graduating from the university, honors students receive the designation of &quot;in cursu honorum&quot; on their diploma and transcripts.

===Military education===
The Fordham Military Science program is available to all undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of their chosen course of study. It is also available to students at more than fifty other colleges and universities in the New York metropolitan area. The program consists of membership and training in the Ram Battalion of the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and a sequence of military science classes taught on campus. Participants in the program are also eligible to enroll in the Air Force ROTC program at Manhattan University and the Navy ROTC program at SUNY Maritime College. In 2011, Fordham Military Science began offering a combat nursing program in conjunction with Regis University and the University of Colorado at Denver.

The Military Science program has several notable alumni, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell, four-star General John M. Keane, and at least four recipients of the Medal of Honor. Furthermore, it has been distinguished as being in the top fifteen percent of military science programs in the country.

In addition to its ROTC program, the university contributes to military education through its Veterans Initiative, which provides full-tuition scholarships and other benefits to post-9/11 veterans of the U.S. military. Because of the initiative, Fordham was named one of the 25 best colleges in the country for veterans in 2013 by &quot;Military History Monthly&quot; Magazine.

===Rankings and reputation===


Fordham University is ranked by several national organizations. In 2025, the university was ranked tied for No. 91st by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in &quot;Best National Universities,&quot; tied at No. 57 in &quot;Best Colleges for Veterans&quot;, tied at 40th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;, 73rd in &quot;Top Value Schools&quot;, and tied for 153rd in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the university 141st among &quot;Top Colleges&quot;, while &quot;Kiplinger&quot; ranked it 62nd of &quot;100 Best Values in Private Universities&quot; in 2018.

For 2021, UniRanking listed Fordham fifth among the top Catholic Universities in the world and fourth among US schools.

In 2014, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked Fordham 131st on a list of &quot;The 600 Smartest Colleges in America,&quot; based on the student body&#x27;s average SAT scores. Fordham has also been named one of the country&#x27;s Hidden Ivies, which are classed as &quot;renowned academic institutions&quot; that &quot;rival the Ivy League.&quot;

The AACSB accredited Gabelli School of Business was ranked tied for tenth in &quot;Undergraduate International Business Rankings&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for 2021, and in 2016, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ranked it the 27th best undergraduate business school in the nation. For 2021, USN&amp;WR ranked Gabelli undergrad business 63rd. For 2022, Poets and Quants ranked Gabelli #1 for Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility and #10 for Best EMBA programs. Also for 2022, The Economist posted their list of the top 100 MBA programs in the world where only 50 were US programs. Gabelli was listed 94th.

Gabelli Business School&#x27;s MBA program tied for 80th among &quot;America&#x27;s Best Business Schools&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In the years prior, the business program was ranked No. 72 among &quot;Best Full-Time MBA Programs&quot; by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; (2015), No. 79 among &quot;Best Executive MBA Programs in the World&quot; by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; (2015), and No. 39 among &quot;Best Executive MBA Programs&quot; by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; (2013).

Globally, Fordham was ranked 90th among the &quot;World&#x27;s top 100 universities for producing millionaires&quot;, as compiled by THE in 2013. According to data from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Fordham ranked at No. 8 out of 71 &quot;highly selective private colleges&quot; yielding the greatest overall social mobility; this data reflects the share of all students who came from lower-income families and ended up in higher-income families after completing their education. École des Mines de Paris&#x27;s listing – which reviews over 3,000 educational institutions around the world, selects some 700 schools and ranks them according to their ability to place their graduates in Fortune 500 CEO and leading positions – ranks Fordham University 16th on their list, making it the highest ranked Catholic institution.

==Athletics==

The university supports 21 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s varsity athletic teams, as well as various club and intramural sports. The Fordham colors are maroon and white and its mascot is the ram. In most varsity sports, the Rams compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and are a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. The football team, however, plays in NCAA Division I FCS and is an associate member of the Patriot League, reported to be the most academically selective NCAA conference after the Ivy League.

The Ram&#x27;s football team ended the 1929 season as title holders according to college football&#x27;s fictitious national championship, boasts two bowl game appearances (1941 and 1942), two Patriot League championships (2002 and 2007) and corresponding NCAA Division I Football Championship appearances. It is best known, however, for the &quot;Seven Blocks of Granite,&quot; a name given to the team&#x27;s 1928 and 1936 offensive lines. The 1936 team was coached by &quot;Sleepy&quot; Jim Crowley, one of the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s famed &quot;Four Horsemen,&quot; and included Vince Lombardi, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach. The team provoked the term &quot;Ivy League&quot; after &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; sportswriter Caswell Adams called then powerhouses Princeton and Yale &quot;only Ivy League&quot; compared to this Fordham team. Moreover, the Los Angeles Rams NFL franchise was named in honor of Fordham&#x27;s football heritage.

The Fordham men&#x27;s basketball program has made four NCAA Tournament appearances and 16 National Invitational Tournament appearances. During the 1971 season, the program enjoyed its best campaign ever, compiling a 26–3 record and earning a No. 9 national ranking. That team was coached by Digger Phelps, who accepted an offer to coach Notre Dame after the 1971 season ended. Peter &quot;PJ&quot; Carlesimo was a reserve on Fordham&#x27;s 1971 team; he later became the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets NBA franchise and was involved in a famous choking incident with Latrell Sprewell. Fordham basketball plays in the Rose Hill Gymnasium (also known as &quot;The Prairie&quot;), the oldest on-campus venue in use by an NCAA Division I basketball team.
The Rams baseball program is among the oldest in the nation and was the first college baseball team to play the game according to modern rules. The program has launched the careers of 57 Major League Baseball players, including National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Frankie Frisch (also known as the &quot;Fordham Flash&quot;). In April 2010, a Fordham baserunner made national headlines when he somersaulted over an opposing team&#x27;s catcher to score a run during a game. The incident was dubbed the &quot;Fordham Flip.&quot; The Rams baseball team holds the record for most NCAA Division I baseball victories in history.

There are eight women&#x27;s teams on campus. The women&#x27;s basketball team won the Atlantic 10 championship in 2014, advancing to the first round of the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship. This feat came just 6 years after the team set an NCAA record for the worst season, finishing the season 0–29 in 2008.

The university&#x27;s programs include track and field, which claims world record holder and Olympic gold medalist Tom Courtney as an alumnus; sailing, which is headquartered at the Morris Yacht and Beach Club in City Island, Bronx; crew, which rows out of the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse on the Harlem River and frequents the Henley Royal Regatta in the United Kingdom; and golf, which is affiliated with the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York.

==Student life==
===Groups and activities===

Clubs and organizations for undergraduate and graduate students number over 130 at the Rose Hill campus and 50 at Lincoln Center.

Fordham College at Rose Hill has a long history of college theater. The university maintains a number of theater groups at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (e.g. the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group). There are also choirs (University Choir, Schola Cantorum, Gloria Dei Choir) and a cappella groups spanning both campuses (Fordham Ramblers, Satin Dolls, b-Sides, Hot Notes, F-sharps). The Mimes and Mummers, the oldest entirely student-run club at Fordham University and among the oldest college theater groups in the United States, was founded in 1855 as the Saint John&#x27;s Dramatic Society. The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater. The club receives from the school a budget which allows the hiring of professional directors, music directors, and choreographers but the shows are student produced, with all elements of technical design run by the club&#x27;s executive board.

In 1905, with the construction of Collins Hall, Fordham University became the first place on the East Coast of the United States to have a theater in the round. The Penthouse Theatre, on the fourth floor of Collins Hall, served both for debuts of professional shows and home for theater groups like the Mimes and Mummers. The Penthouse Theatre was turned into office space in 1966.

In 1990, Alumni House, believed to be constructed in 1842 by William Rodrigue as a personal residence, an architect involved in the building of much of the early campus, was turned into a student-run space. Despite this account being questioned by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in the report of its listing, it came to be known as Rodrigue&#x27;s Coffee House. Rodrigue&#x27;s, more commonly referred to as &quot;Rod&#x27;s&quot; is an entirely student run coffee house and event space. Notable artists such as Frankie Cosmos, Matt and Kim, Japanese Breakfast, and Dreamcrusher have performed at Rod&#x27;s.

===Media===
The university has a number of student publications, including &quot;The Fordham Ram&quot;, the university&#x27;s official journal of record; &quot;The Observer&quot;, the newspaper for the Lincoln Center campus; the &quot;Fordham Political Review&quot;, the university&#x27;s &quot;undergraduate publication dedicated to politics, economics, social sciences, international affairs, and culture&quot;; &quot;The Rival&quot;, an online-only student-run publication; and &quot;the paper&quot;, a student-run free-speech alternative journal. 

WFUV is Fordham&#x27;s 50,000-watt radio station, broadcasting on 90.7 FM. Founded in 1947, the station serves approximately 350,000 listeners weekly in the New York City metropolitan area. It is a National Public Radio affiliate and has an adult alternative format on weekdays and a variety format on weekends. In 2017 &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked WFUV the second best college radio station in the United States.

===Campus ministry===

The purpose of Campus Ministry at Fordham is to provide &quot;opportunities and resources for spiritual growth to members of [the university] community.&quot; It offers programming for more than 15 faith traditions in such areas as worship, music ministry, and social ministry. One of its most popular initiatives is its retreats, which are held at the university&#x27;s McGrath House of Prayer in Goshen, New York, and other retreat houses in the New York City metropolitan area. In addition to its Jesuit traditions, the university also has organizations devoted to Judaism, Islam, and other religions.

The university has a church and numerous chapels across its campuses. At Rose Hill are the University Church which houses Our Lady&#x27;s Chapel in the basement; the Blue Chapel on the third floor of Keating Hall; the Sacred Heart Chapel in Dealy Hall; the St. Robert Bellarmine Chapel at Spellman Hall; along with chapels at several student residence halls. At the Lincoln Center campus is the Bl. Rupert Meyer Chapel in the Leon Lowenstein Building.

In conjunction with the Office of Mission and Ministry, Global Outreach (GO!) operates as a cultural immersion and service program where students learn about various issues of social, economic, political, and environmental injustice while living a simple lifestyle that fosters communal and spiritual growth. Teams consist of approximately 10 students, one student leader, and one chaperone to live, work, and learn with partnering organizations. Building on the Jesuit tenets of Men and Women for Others, Magis, and Contemplatives in Action, GO! has grown over the years to include more than 30 projects throughout the United States and countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. GO!&#x27;s roots stretch back to the 1950s, when Fordham students were participating in various service and immersion projects. In the 1970s and &#x27;80s it became known as the Mexico project, with students coining the term Global Outreach in 1988.

The Dorothy Day Center for Service and Justice is responsible for overseeing Fordham&#x27;s various community service and humanitarian initiatives. Grounded in the Jesuit principle of training &quot;men and women for others&quot;, the center organizes projects in such areas as poverty, hunger, education, and disaster relief. As a result of the Dorothy Day Center&#x27;s efforts, the university performed approximately one million hours of service in 2011, ranking it sixth among universities country-wide in terms of community outreach. A popular volunteer location among students is the Jesuit Health Care Center at the Rose Hill campus where students interested in nursing gain practical experience. The Dorothy Day Center also offers a pre-orientation &quot;Urban Plunge&quot; program, introducing incoming freshmen to social justice issues in New York City.

===Sustainability===
In order to increase its sustainability, the university has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2017. In addition, it has pledged to employ low-flow faucets and shower heads, use sustainable materials like reprocessed flooring, recycle up to 90% of its debris, and seek LEED Silver certification in its construction of new facilities on campus. Also, the Department of Grounds Maintenance at Fordham has committed to making half of its vehicle fleet electric by 2016. The university has also proposed numerous environmental initiatives, including using certified green cleaning products, a uniform recycling program, and composting in cooperation with the New York Botanical Garden.

Fordham&#x27;s Rose Hill campus is home to one of the largest collections of mature American elms in the country, the oldest estimated to be 270 years old.

==Traditions and symbols==
===Traditions===
Since its founding in 1841, the university has developed many traditions. Some of them are described below:

* The President&#x27;s Ball takes place every autumn on the eve of the Homecoming football game. It is a business formal event held in the Vince Lombardi Field House. It is hosted by the Office of the President, from which the name is derived.

* The Winter Ball is a business casual event staged each winter by the United Student Government and the Activities Board of Lincoln Center, at venues in New York City including the Rainbow Room, the Russian Tea Room, and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.
* The &quot;Under the Tent&quot; Dance is a smart casual event held the weekend before final exams. Sponsored by the university&#x27;s Residence Halls Association, it takes place underneath a tent on Martyrs&#x27; Lawn, Fordham&#x27;s second-largest quadrangle, and has a different theme each year. The dance is part of the Spring Weekend Festival, which also includes two concerts, a barbecue, a race around the Rose Hill campus, and a comedy show. The dance was previously held at the Lincoln Center campus as well, but was replaced in 2015 by an end-of-the-year event called &quot;The Bash&quot;.
*The Festival of Lessons and Carols: The Fordham University Concert Choir presents a series of Nine Lessons and Carols every year during the Christmas season. An afternoon concert is performed at the University Church on the Rose Hill campus, and an evening concert is performed at the St. Paul the Apostle Church adjacent to the Lincoln Center campus.
* Each semester, the official beginning of the final exam period is marked by a &quot;midnight breakfast&quot;, in which Fordham administration and professors cook students their favorite breakfast items so as to prepare them for the long night of studying ahead of them. The name comes from &quot;burning the midnight oil&quot; with studies, not from the time of the breakfast.
* The Liberty Cup was awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia universities. The tradition began in 2002, a year after the Fordham-Columbia game was postponed due to September 11 attacks. , the series was ended by Columbia.
* The Rams-Crusader Trophy in football was first awarded in 1951 to commemorate a great coach of both Fordham and Holy Cross: Frank &quot;Iron Major&quot; Cavanaugh.
* Fordham College at Rose Hill hosts an Encaenia each year in early May. Faculty, administrators, and students process in academic regalia, and candidates for degrees at the current year&#x27;s Commencement receive various awards and honors. The ceremony includes a sentimental speech by the year&#x27;s valedictorian, as well as a generally more humorous, yet equally endearing, speech by the honorary Lord or Lady of the Manor.

===Symbols===
In addition to its traditions, Fordham is associated with a number of symbols, some of which are discussed below:

* The university&#x27;s official color used to be magenta, one which was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled through a series of baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.
* The ram became the university&#x27;s mascot as a result of a slightly vulgar cheer Fordham fans sang during an 1893 football game against the United States Military Academy. The fans began cheering, &quot;One-damn, two-damn, three-damn, Fordham!&quot; which was an instant hit. Later, &quot;damn&quot; was sanitized to &quot;ram&quot; so the song would conform to the university&#x27;s image.
* Presented to Fordham by Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (&#x27;44) of the US Navy, the Victory Bell was the ship&#x27;s bell of the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Junyo&quot;. First rung on campus by President Harry S. Truman on May 11, 1946, it currently stands in front of the Rose Hill Gymnasium and peals following all Ram athletic victories and at the start of Commencement each year.
* The design of the Great Seal of Fordham University acknowledges the Society of Jesus presence on campus, hence elements of the order&#x27;s coat of arms in the center on a light-purple shield, without the usual sunburst background. The borrowed elements include the IHS monogram used by the Jesuits as an abbreviation for the name of Jesus in Greek: &quot;IHSOUS&quot;, in this case with the Cross resting on the center of the H, and the three nails of the Crucifixion beneath the epigraph. These elements dressed in gold lay on the purple shield framed in maroon, the color of the university, with silver fleur-de-lis strung together atop the bordering frame at the edge of the shield. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French origin of the Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown in green on a light blue background, enclosing the university&#x27;s original pedagogical disciplines in white capital letters listed above each other in the following order: ARTS, SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, LAW. Below the shield is a light blue scroll with the university&#x27;s motto in black capital letters, &quot;SAPENTIA ET DOCTRINA&quot;. Both the shield and the scroll rest on a gold field emblematic of learning (&quot;doctrina&quot;), upon which surrounds them with 14 fiery tongues of the Holy Spirit, evenly distributed, a symbol of wisdom (&quot;sapientia&quot;). Finally, surrounding the entire seal is an heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. It forms a circular maroon loop embroidered with green beads on its inner and outer edge, with a gold buckle and end tip. The belt is emblazoned with Fordham&#x27;s official Latin title in gold capital letters: &quot;UNIVERSITAS FORDHAMENSIS&quot;; between the last two punch holes where the buckle is fastened and the end looped inside to wrap around, is in gold the date of the university&#x27;s founding: &quot;1841&quot;. The University of Oxford, the only other tertiary institution in the world that uses a belt in its seal, maintains that without its belt, their seal is not official.

* The mace of Fordham is traditionally carried at Commencement by the president of the Faculty Senate, who serves as the grand marshal of the main academic procession. The device, four feet in length, bears a regal crown at the summit to denote the sole power of the State of New York to grant academic degrees in its territory. Above the crown is a cross composed of four windmill sails, which signify the Catholic faith and the Dutch founders of New York City, respectively. The center of the cross displays a heraldic rose, which symbolizes Rose Hill. Immediately beneath the crown is a support, on which the university&#x27;s seal is emblazoned. The upper node of the mace&#x27;s staff is decorated with three heraldic roses, the Fordham seal, a ram&#x27;s head, and a silhouette of the original Lincoln Center campus skyline. The titles of the university&#x27;s constituent colleges are engraved above the node, and the names of the school&#x27;s presidents from 1841 to 1966 are inscribed below it. The mace was a gift to the university from the Fordham University Alumni Federation.
*The Terrace of the presidents: Robert Gannon, president of Fordham from 1936 to 1949, initiated the custom of engraving the granite steps leading up to Keating Hall with the names of heads of state who visit the university. Among the names engraved are George Washington, who visited the Rose Hill Manor before it was succeeded by St. John&#x27;s College in 1841; Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Harry S. Truman; Richard Nixon; and the names of various other heads of state from around the world.
* Fordham&#x27;s official school song is &quot;Alma Mater Fordham,&quot; and its fight song is &quot;Fordham Ram&quot; by J. Ignatius Coveney. In December 2013 the lyrics to &quot;Fordham Ram&quot; were changed from &quot;Hail Men of Fordham, hail&quot; to &quot;Hail Rams of Fordham, hail&quot; to be inclusive of the school&#x27;s female majority. &quot;The Marching Song&quot; is typically played during parades and after athletic games, especially after a Ram victory.

<text>Bingham is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, relative to the Earth. It is named after the American academic, explorer and politician Hiram Bingham III. It lies just to the southeast of the much larger crater Lobachevskiy, and the northwestern part of the rim of Bingham is partly overlaid by ejecta from Lobachevsky. To the northeast of Bingham is the crater Guyot, and about a crater diameter to the south-southeast is Katchalsky. This is a roughly circular crater formation with a slight outward bulge along the southeastern side.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bingham.

==In popular culture==
Bingham, along with another crater, Viviani, was referenced in the Midsomer Murders season 14 episode &#x27;Dark Secrets&#x27;.

<text>is a Japanese linguist. He makes a study of Chinese phonology and of Old Japanese transcribed into Chinese characters by sound.

== Work ==
He is renowned for a research on the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. He divides the history book into two groups and claims that Group α (Vol. 14–21, 24–27, 30) was documented by native speakers of the Northern Chinese dialect during the Tang dynasty while Group β (Vol. 1–13, 22–23, 28–29) was written by Japanese. He noticed that Group α is standard written Chinese and applies Chinese characters consistently to Japanese words, but Group β is Japanized Chinese and indiscriminates some characters that were distinguished in Northern Chinese.

He received the 20th Dr Kindaichi Memorial Award (1992) for &quot;Chronicles of Ancient Phonology (古代の音韻と日本書紀の成立』に対して)&quot;.

<doc id="430034" wikidata="Q2746050" url="?curid=430034" title="Catalan grammar">
<text>Catalan grammar, the morphology and syntax of the Catalan language, is similar to the grammar of most other Romance languages. Catalan is a relatively synthetic, fusional language.

Features include:
*Use of definite and indefinite articles.
*Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine) and number (singular and plural). The numerals &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;two&#x27; and the numeral &#x27;hundred&#x27; from two-hundred onwards are also inflected for gender.
*Highly inflected verbs, for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).
*Word order is freer than in English.

Some distinctive features of Catalan among Romance languages include the general lack of masculine markers (like Italian &quot;-o&quot;), a trait shared with French and Occitan; and the fact that the remote preterite tense of verbs is usually formed with a periphrasis consisting of the verb &quot;to go&quot; plus infinitive.

== Articles ==
Catalan has two types of article, definite and indefinite. They are declined for gender and number, and must agree with the noun they qualify. As with other Romance languages, Catalan articles are subject to complex elision and contraction processes.

The inflection of articles is complex, especially because of frequent elision, but is similar to neighboring languages. Catalan has more preposition–article contractions than Spanish, like &quot;dels&quot; (&quot;of + the [plural]&quot;), but fewer than Italian (which has &quot;sul&quot;, &quot;col&quot;, &quot;nel&quot;, etc.).

=== Definite ===
The tables below summarize the forms of the definite article, its elisions, and its contractions.

==== Masculine forms ====
* The masculine singular form is &quot;el&quot;. The initial vowel is elided before a vowel or &quot;h&quot;, yielding to &quot;l&#x27;&quot;.
:: &quot;El pare. L&#x27;avi.&quot;
:: &quot;The father.&quot; &quot;The grandfather.&quot;
* &quot;El&quot; is not elided if the word begins with semivocalic &quot;(h)i-&quot; .
:: &quot;El iode. El hiat.&quot;
:: &quot;The iodine.&quot; &quot;The hiatus&quot;
* The masculine plural form is &quot;els&quot;. Both &quot;el&quot; and &quot;els&quot; combine with the prepositions &quot;a&quot; &quot;to&quot;, &quot;de&quot; &quot;of&quot;, and &quot;per&quot; &quot;for&quot;, yielding the contractions &quot;al&quot;, &quot;als&quot;, &quot;del&quot;, &quot;dels&quot;, &quot;pel&quot;, &quot;pels&quot;.
:: &quot;Ho dic al pare.&quot;
:: &quot;I say it to the father.&quot; (&quot;I say it to my father&quot;)
:: &quot;Això és del noi.&quot;
:: &quot;This is of the boy.&quot; (&quot;This belongs to the boy&quot;)
:: &quot;Corria pels camins.&quot;
:: &quot;I ran through the paths.&quot; (&quot;I ran along the paths&quot;)
* &quot;El&quot; does not contract with the aforementioned prepositions if the following word begins with vowel or &quot;h&quot;.
:: &quot;Porta-ho a l&#x27;avi.&quot;
:: &quot;Bring this to the grandfather.&quot;
:: &quot;Baixa de l&#x27;arbre.&quot;
:: &quot;Get down from the tree.&quot;

==== Feminine forms ====
* The feminine singular form is &quot;la&quot;. The final vowel is elided before a vowel or &quot;h&quot;, yielding &quot;l&#x27;&quot;.
:: &quot;La mare. L&#x27;àvia&quot;
:: &quot;The mother.&quot; &quot;The grandmother&quot;
* &quot;La&quot; is not contracted if the word begins with unstressed &quot;(h)i-&quot;, or &quot;(h)u-&quot;.
:: &quot;La idea. La hipòtesi. La unitat. La humitat.&quot;
:: &quot;The idea.&quot; &quot;The hypothesis.&quot; &quot;The unit.&quot; &quot;The humidity.&quot;
* &quot;La&quot; is not elided with the words &quot;una&quot; &quot;one (hour)&quot;, &quot;host&quot; &quot;hueste&quot;, and &quot;ira&quot; &quot;wrath&quot;; as well as with words beginning with the Greek prefix &quot;a-&quot;, like &quot;asimetria&quot; &quot;asymmetry&quot;.
* The feminine plural form is &quot;les&quot;. 
*Feminine articles are not contracted with prepositions.

==== Articles for personal names ====
Forenames and surnames must carry a definite article. In addition to the ordinary singular forms, alternative forms derived from the Latin vocative &quot;domine&quot; can be used. The elision rules are the same for &quot;el&quot; and &quot;la&quot;.

:: &quot;El Joan. L&#x27;Andreu. La Mercè. La Isabel. L&#x27;Olga.&quot;
:: &quot;En Joan. N&#x27;Andreu. Na Mercè. Na Isabel. N&#x27;Olga.&quot;

==== Dialectal variation ====
In Western Catalonia the dialectal versions &quot;lo&quot; and &quot;los&quot; are used instead of &quot;el&quot; and &quot;els&quot;.

In some regions, especially in the Balearic islands, the definite article derives from the Latin determiner &quot;ipse&quot;. These forms are referred to as &quot;articles salats&quot;. Similar forms are found in Sardinian and some varieties of Occitan.

=== Indefinite ===
The table below summarize the forms of the indefinite article. Indefinite articles are not elided nor contracted.
==Overview of gender and number inflection==

Most adjectives, and a fair number of nouns, inflect for gender. This usually follows a regular pattern of endings. The two main patterns are generally referred to as &quot;four-form&quot; and &quot;two-form&quot; adjectives. Four-form adjectives have distinct masculine and feminine forms, whereas two-form adjectives have the same form for both masculine and feminine. They are derived from the Latin first/second, and the third declension respectively. Many nouns follow the four-form inflection, but some may follow the two-form inflection. Some are irregular in some way.


Similar to French, but unlike Portuguese, Spanish or Italian, the Latin/Romance final &quot;-o&quot; and &quot;-e&quot; have disappeared. Thus, the alternance of &quot;-o&quot;/&quot;-a&quot; in the four-form words has been substituted by &quot;-&quot;/&quot;-a&quot;. There are only a few exceptions, like &quot;minso&quot;/&quot;minsa&quot; (&quot;scarce&quot;).

Among nouns, Catalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has &quot;noi&quot;/&quot;noia&quot; (&quot;boy&quot;/&quot;girl&quot;) and &quot;gall&quot;/&quot;gallina&quot; (&quot;cock&quot;/&quot;chicken&quot;), whereas French has &quot;garçon&quot;/&quot;fille&quot; and &quot;coq&quot;/&quot;poule&quot;. 

There is a tendency to inflect adjectives as four-form instead of two-form, something that is prevalent in Occitan and standard in French. Thus, alongside traditional two-form &quot;bullent&quot;/&quot;bullent&quot; (&quot;boiling&quot;), one can also find four-form &quot;bullent&quot;/&quot;bullenta&quot;.

===Variants===

Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur between masculine and feminine, like:
* Affrication: &quot;boig/&quot;boja&quot; (&quot;insane&quot;) vs. &quot;lleig/&quot;lletja&quot; (&quot;ugly&quot;)
* Loss of &quot;n&quot;: &quot;pla&quot;/&quot;plana&quot; (&quot;flat&quot;) vs. &quot;segon&quot;/&quot;segona&quot; (&quot;second&quot;)
* Final obstruent devoicing: &quot;sentit/&quot;sentida&quot; (&quot;felt&quot;) vs. &quot;dit/&quot;dita&quot; (&quot;said&quot;) vs. &quot;fred&quot;/&quot;freda&quot; (&quot;cold&quot;)

In words that end in a sibilant sound, the masculine plural ending is &quot;-os&quot; instead of just &quot;-s&quot;. Feminines still have &quot;-es&quot; or, if they follow the two-form declension, no ending at all. Compare: &quot;el pols&quot;/&quot;els polsos&quot; (&quot;the pulse&quot;/&quot;the pulses&quot;) vs. &quot;la pols&quot;/&quot;les pols&quot; (&quot;the dust&quot;/&quot;the dusts&quot;).

Adjectives that end in &quot;-ç&quot; follow the two-form declension in the singular, but four-form in the plural, so that they actually have three forms:

==Nouns==

Catalan nouns are inflected for gender (masculine or feminine), and number (singular or plural). There is no case inflection. Articles and adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to.

Usually, masculine nouns are unmarked, feminine nouns carry the suffix &quot;-a&quot;; and the plural is marked with the suffix &quot;-s&quot;, which makes the feminine ending turn into &quot;-e-&quot;. Thus, the most common declension paradigm for Catalan names is the one that follows:

===Gender inflection===
The grammatical gender of a Catalan noun does not necessarily correspond with the real-life object&#x27;s biological sex (or lack thereof). Nouns denoting a person, such as &quot;home&quot; &quot;man&quot; or &quot;dona&quot; &quot;woman&quot;, generally agree with the natural gender of what is described. However, Catalan assigns gender to nouns without natural gender in arbitrary fashion. For example, the word &quot;tamboret&quot; (&quot;stool&quot;) is masculine, while the word &quot;cadira&quot; (&quot;chair&quot;) is feminine.

====Living beings with distinct masculine and feminine forms====
Living beings of the same species usually are designed by two nouns: one of masculine grammatical gender for biologically male individuals, and one of feminine grammatical gender for biologically female individuals. Both names, masculine and feminine, are usually only differentiated by their ending; sometimes the second is derived from the first or vice versa. Rarely, both come from different roots.

=====Formation of the feminine form from the masculine=====
*Most times the feminine form is created by appending the suffix &quot;-a&quot; to the unmarked masculine form.
::&quot;Noi → noia. Avi → àvia.&quot;
::&quot;Boy – girl.&quot; &quot;Grandfather – grandmother.&quot;
*If the masculine form ends in &quot;-t&quot;, &quot;-p&quot;, &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-s&quot;, the addition of the feminine suffix &quot;-a&quot; may cause these consonants to become voiced to &quot;-d-&quot;, &quot;-b-&quot;, &quot;-v-&quot;, &quot;-s-&quot;; or not. There are no rules to deduce the change.
*If the masculine form ends in a stressed vowel, the feminine is created by appending the suffix &quot;-na&quot;.
::&quot;Germà → germana&quot;
::&quot;Brother – sister.&quot;
*Sometimes the feminine form is created by appending the suffix &quot;-essa&quot; to the unmarked masculine form.
::&quot;Sacerdot → sacerdotessa.&quot;
::&quot;Priest – priestess.&quot;

=====Formation of the masculine form from the feminine=====
*Sometimes the masculine form is created from the feminine by changing the suffix &quot;a&quot; for &quot;-ot&quot;.
::&quot;Bruixot ← bruixa.&quot;
::&quot;Sorcerer — witch.&quot;

====Living beings with indistinct masculine and feminine forms====
*Sometimes a single noun is used to designate both masculine and feminine beings. To specify the biological gender of the being, the adjectives &quot;mascle&quot; &quot;male&quot;, and &quot;femella&quot; &quot;female&quot; are used.
::&quot;El rossinyol. El rossinyol mascle. El rossinyol femella.&quot;
::&quot; The nightingale.&quot; &quot;The male nightingale.&quot; &quot;The female nightingale&quot;

====Objects, abstract concepts====
*Since objects and abstract concepts have no biological gender, all of them only have one form. The gender of inanimate nouns is assigned arbitrarily. Sometimes the choice may seem contradictory.
::&quot;La virilitat (f).&quot;
::&quot;The manliness.&quot;
*Sometimes synonymous words may have different genders.
::&quot; El televisor (m) – la televisió (f). L&#x27;argent (m) – la plata (f)&quot;
::&quot;The TV.&quot; &quot;The silver.&quot;

====Homophonous words with different genders====
*Some homonymous words may have different genders according to their meaning.
::&quot;El clau (m) – la clau (f)&quot;
::&quot;The nail – the key.&quot;

=== Number inflection ===
Like all the Western Romance languages, the formation of the plural involves the addition of the suffix &quot;-s&quot; to the singular. However, the stem may undergo some changes. The number inflection of adjectives follows the same rules.
* Most times the plural form is created by appending the suffix -s to the singular form.
*: &quot;Pare → pares. Avi → avis.&quot;
*: &quot;Father – fathers.&quot; &quot;Grandfather – grandfathers.&quot;
* If the singular ends in &quot;-a&quot;, the plural is usually formed with &quot;-es&quot;. Most of these nouns are feminine, but some are masculine.
*: &quot;Casa → cases (f). Problema → problemes (m).&quot;
*: &quot;House – houses.&quot; &quot;Problem – problems&quot;
** However, if the singular ends in &quot;-ga&quot;, &quot;-ca&quot;, &quot;-gua&quot;, &quot;-qua&quot;, &quot;-ça&quot;, &quot;-ja&quot;, the plural is formed by &quot;-gues&quot;, &quot;-ques&quot;, &quot;-gües&quot;, &quot;-qües&quot;, &quot;-ces&quot;, &quot;-ges&quot;. This is done for orthographical reasons, and stem pronunciation remains identical in the singular and plural.


* If the singular form ends in a stressed vowel, the plural is usually created by appending the suffix &quot;-ns&quot;.
*: &quot;Pa → pans (m). Capità → capitans (m). Acció → accions (f).&quot;
*: &quot;Bread – breads.&quot; &quot;Captain – captains.&quot; &quot;Action – actions.&quot;
** However, some words ending in a stressed vowel form their plural in -&quot;s&quot;. Many of them are relatively recent loanwords not directly inherited from late Latin.
**: &quot;Sofà → sofàs. Bambú → bambús.&quot;
**: &quot;Sofa – sofas.&quot; &quot;Bamboo – bamboos.&quot;
** A few nouns ending in unstressed &quot;-e&quot; can also form their plural alternatively in &quot;-ns&quot;. It is considered archaic or dialectal.
**: &quot;Home → homes&quot; or &quot;hòmens. Orfe → orfes&quot; or &quot;òrfens&quot;
**: &quot;Man – men.&quot; &quot;Orphan – orphans.&quot;
* Many masculine nouns ending in &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;ç&quot; form their plural with &quot;-os&quot;. &quot;-s-&quot; becomes voiced in the plural, but &quot;-ç-&quot; remains unvoiced.
*: &quot;Gas → gas&quot;os&quot; &quot;/ˈgas – ˈgazus ~ ˈgazos/&quot;. Braç → braç&quot;os&quot; &quot;/ˈbɾas – ˈbɾasus ~ ˈbɾasos/.
*: &quot;Gas – gases.&quot; &quot;Arm – arms.&quot;
** In some masculine nouns ending in &quot;-s&quot;, this remains unvoiced when adding &quot;-os&quot;, and thus becomes &quot;-ss-&quot;:
*** Most polysyllabic masculine words ending in &quot;-às&quot;, &quot;-ís&quot;, &quot;ús&quot;.
***: &quot;Fracàs → fracassos. Pastís → pastissos. Barnús → barnu&quot;ss&quot;os&quot;
***: &quot;Failure – failures.&quot; &quot;Cake – cakes.&quot; &quot;Bathrobe – bathrobes&quot;
*** Most masculine words ending in &quot;-os&quot;, &quot;-ós&quot;, &quot;òs&quot;.
***: &quot;Gos → go&quot;ss&quot;os. Arròs → arro&quot;ss&quot;os. Os → o&quot;ss&quot;os.&quot;
***: &quot;Dog – dogs.&quot; &quot;Rice – rices.&quot; &quot;Bear – bears&quot;. (also &quot;Bone – bones&quot;).
* Masculine paroxytone and proparoxytone nouns ending in &quot;-s&quot; are invariable.
*: &quot;Llapis → llapis. Òmnibus – òmnibus&quot;
*: &quot;Pencil – pencils.&quot; &quot;Omnibus – omnibuses.&quot;
* Feminine nouns ending in an s-like sound (&quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-ç&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, &quot;-z&quot;) have a plural that is pronounced the same as the singular. If the noun ends in &quot;-s&quot;, no ending is added. Otherwise, an unpronounced &quot;-s&quot; is added.
*: &quot;Pols → pols.&quot;
*: &quot;Dust – dusts.&quot;
*: &quot;Calç → calçs&quot; .
*: &quot;Lime – limes.&quot;
* Nouns ending in &quot;-x&quot; pronounced form plurals according to word stress. If the noun is stressed on the last syllable, the plural suffix is &quot;-os&quot;. Otherwise, the ending is &quot;-s&quot; and the plural form is homophonous with the singular.
*: &quot;Reflex → reflexos &quot;. &quot;Índex → índexs &quot;.
*: &quot;Reflection – reflections.&quot; &quot;Index – indexes.&quot;
* Nouns ending in &quot;-x&quot; pronounced form their plural with &quot;-os&quot;.
*: &quot;Calaix → calaixos.&quot;
*: &quot;Drawer – drawers.&quot;
* Nouns ending in &quot;-ig&quot; () can form their plural in two ways, both acceptable:
** Adding &quot;-s&quot;. Both forms will be homophonous. This is the preferred form in normative grammars, not so in general spoken use.
**: &quot;Faig → faigs &quot;. &quot;Passeig → passeigs&quot; .
** Replacing &quot;-ig&quot; with &quot;jos&quot; or &quot;tjos&quot;. There are no rules to deduce which is to be used.
**: &quot;Faig → fajos &quot;/ˈfat͡ʃ – ˈfaʒus ~ ˈfad͡ʒos/&quot;. Mig → mitjos. &quot;/ˈmit͡ʃ – ˈmidʒus ~ mid͡ːʒos/.
**: &quot;Beech – beeches.&quot; &quot;Half – halves.&quot;
* Nouns ending in &quot;-sc&quot;, &quot;-st&quot;, &quot;-xt&quot; can form their plural in two ways, both acceptable: Adding &quot;-s&quot; (preferred), or adding &quot;-os&quot;.
*: &quot;Bosc → boscs or &quot;boscos. Gust → gusts or &quot;gustos. Pretext → pretexts or &quot;pretextos
*: &quot;Forest – forests.&quot; &quot;Taste – tastes.&quot; &quot;Pretext – pretexts.&quot;
* Feminine nouns ending in &quot;-st&quot; always form the plural by adding &quot;-s&quot;.
*: &quot;Host → host&quot;s&quot;.&quot;
*: &quot;Army – armies.&quot;

==Adjectives==
A Catalan adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it accompanies. Most adjectives are placed after the nouns. Adjectives can be divided into three declension paradigms. The number inflection rules are the same as the nouns.

===Declension===
Catalan adjectives can be divided in three groups according to the distinct forms it has.


====Formation of the feminine singular from the masculine singular====
In adjectives with distinct feminine singular form, the masculine is usually unmarked for gender, and ends in a consonant. The feminine singular form of regular adjectives can be created from the masculine singular.

=====Unmarked masculine forms=====
*Most times the feminine form is created by appending the suffix &quot;-a&quot; to the unmarked masculine form.
::&quot;Sec – seca. Fred – freda. Continu – contínua.&quot;
::&quot;Dry.&quot; &quot;Cold.&quot; &quot;Continuous.&quot;
*If the masculine form ends in &quot;-t&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-s&quot;, the addition of the feminine suffix &quot;-a&quot; may cause these consonants to become voiced to &quot;-d-&quot;, &quot;-g-&quot;, &quot;-s-&quot;; or not. There are no rules governing this change.
*If the masculine form ends in a stressed vowel, the feminine is created by appending the suffix &quot;-na&quot;.; except &quot;nu&quot; &quot;nude&quot; and &quot;cru&quot; &quot;raw&quot;.
::&quot;Pla – plana. Rodó – rodona.&quot;
::&quot;Flat.&quot; &quot;Round.&quot;
*If the masculine form ends in &quot;-au&quot;, &quot;-eu&quot;, &quot;-iu&quot;, and &quot;-ou&quot;; the feminine is formed with &quot;-ava&quot;, &quot;-ea&quot;, &quot;-iva&quot;, and &quot;-ova&quot;.
::&quot;Blau – blava. Europeu – europea. Viu – viva. Nou – nova.&quot;
::&quot;Blue.&quot; &quot;European.&quot; &quot;Alive.&quot; &quot;New.&quot;

=====Marked masculine forms ending in &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o&quot;=====
If the masculine form ends in &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o&quot;, the final vowel is substituted with &quot;-a&quot;. Many of the adjectives ending in &quot;-o&quot; come from Spanish. 
:&quot;Ample – ampla. Maco – maca&quot; (Cf. Sp. &quot;majo&quot;).
:&quot;Wide.&quot; &quot;Nice.&quot;

====Adjectives with indistinct masculine and feminine forms====
Some adjectives may have the same form in the masculine singular and feminine singular.
*Adjectives ending in &quot;-aç&quot;, &quot;-iç&quot;, and &quot;-oç&quot;.
::&quot;Capaç – capaç. Feliç – feliç. Precoç – precoç.&quot;
::&quot;Capable.&quot; &quot;Happy.&quot; &quot;Precocious.&quot;
*Adjectives ending in stressed &quot;-al&quot;, stressed &quot;-el&quot;, and stressed or unstressed &quot;-il&quot;.
::&quot;Central -central. Rebel – rebel. Hostil – hostil. Mòbil – mòbil&quot;.
::&quot;Central.&quot; &quot;Rebel.&quot; &quot;Hostile.&quot; &quot;Mobile.&quot;
*Adjectives ending in &quot;-ar&quot;.
::&quot;Vulgar – Vulgar&quot;
::&quot;Vulgar&quot;

====Irregular feminine forms====
Some feminine adjectives are formed irregularly and do not adhere to the aforementioned formation rules.

===Degrees of comparison===
Degrees of comparison are expressed with a construction implying the adverb &quot;més&quot; &quot;more&quot; or &quot;menys&quot; &quot;less&quot;:
*&quot;Més ... que&quot; (&quot;more ... than&quot;)
::&quot;Sóc més alt que tu.&quot;
::&quot;I am taller than you.&quot;
*&quot;El més ... de&quot; (&quot;the most ... of&quot;)
::&quot;Sóc el més alt de tots&quot;
::&quot;I am the tallest of all&quot;.
*&quot;Menys ... que&quot; (&quot;less ... than&quot;)
::&quot;Sóc menys alt que tu.&quot;
::&quot;I am less tall than you.&quot;

===Absolute superlative===
Like many other Romance languages, Catalan adjectives have an absolute superlative form, expressed with the suffix &quot;-íssim&quot;, placed between the stem and the gender / number suffix.

::&quot;Aquest home és altíssim.&quot;
::&quot;This man is very very tall.&quot;

::&quot;Aquestes dones són altíssimes.&quot;
::&quot;These women are very very tall.&quot;

==Adverbs==
Catalan adverbs, like their English counterparts, are used to modify adjectives, other adverbs, and verbs or clauses. They do not display any inflection; that is, their form does not change to reflect their precise role, nor any characteristics of what they modify.

===Formation===
In Catalan, as in English, most adverbs are derived from adjectives. In most cases, this is done by adding the suffix &quot;-ment&quot; (&quot;-ly&quot;) to the adjective&#x27;s feminine singular form. For example, the feminine singular form of &quot;lent&quot; (&quot;slow&quot;) is &quot;lenta&quot;, so the corresponding adverb is &quot;lentament&quot; (&quot;slowly&quot;).

As in English, however, the adjective stem is sometimes modified to accommodate the suffix:

And, as in English, many common adverbs are not derived from adjectives at all:
: &quot;així&quot; (&quot;thus&quot;, &quot;so&quot;).
: &quot;ahir&quot; (&quot;yesterday&quot;).

===Placement===
The placement of Catalan adverbs is almost the same as the placement of English adverbs.

An adverb that modifies an adjective or adverb comes before that adjective or adverb:
: &quot;completament cert&quot; (&quot;completely true&quot;).
: &quot;massa ben fet&quot; (&quot;too well done&quot;).

An adverb that modifies an infinitive (verbal noun) generally comes after the infinitive:
: &quot;caminar lentament&quot; (&quot;to walk slowly&quot;).

An adverb that modifies a main verb or clause comes either after the verb, or before the clause:
: &quot;Lentament ell comença a caminar&quot; or &quot;Ell comença lentament a caminar&quot; (&quot;Slowly, he begins to walk&quot; or &quot;He begins slowly to walk&quot;).
Note that, unlike in English, this is true even of negative adverbs:
: &quot;Mai jo no he fet això&quot; or &quot;Jo no he fet mai això&quot; (&quot;Never have I done that&quot; or &quot;I have never done that&quot;).

==Possessives==

===Possessive pronouns===
Possessive pronouns are inflected for person and number of the possessor, and for gender and number of the possession.
The table below summarizes all the possible forms.

::&quot;El cotxe és meu.&quot;
::&quot;The car is mine.&quot;

The feminine forms &quot;meva&quot;, &quot;teva&quot;, and &quot;seva&quot; may appear dialectally with instead of : &quot;meua&quot;, &quot;teua&quot;, and &quot;seua&quot;. Their plural forms follow the same variation (&quot;meues&quot;, &quot;teues&quot;, and &quot;seues&quot;).

===Possessive adjectives===
Possessive adjectives are, like the possessive pronouns, inflected for person and number of the possessor, and for gender and number of the possession. The table below summarizes all the possible forms. Notice how the plural possessor forms are identical to the possessive pronoun forms.

Central Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (&quot;mon&quot;, etc.) in favour of constructions of article + stressed forms (&quot;el meu&quot;, etc.), a feature shared with Italian and Portuguese.
*Unstressed forms are rarely used in the spoken language, and are only retained for family relatives and set phrases.
::&quot;Ton pare. Son avi.&quot;
::&quot;Your father.&quot; &quot;His / her grandfather.&quot;

::&quot;En ma vida.&quot;
::&quot;In my whole life.&quot;
*Instead of this, a construction of &quot;definite article + possessive pronoun + noun&quot; is preferred.
::&quot;Mon cotxe.&quot; (literary, archaic)
::&quot;El meu cotxe.&quot; (more common)
::&quot;My car.&quot;

==Pronouns==

===Personal pronouns===

The morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, specially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian; French has such a different system that comparisons are not feasible). Features include the neuter gender (&quot;ho&quot;) and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).

This flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have &quot;m&#x27;hi recomanaren&quot; (&quot;they recommended me to him&quot;), whereas in French one must say &quot;ils m&#x27;ont recommendé à lui&quot;, and in Spanish &quot;me recomendaron a él&quot;. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).



== Verbs ==
Catalan verbs express an action or a state of being of a given subject, and like verbs in most of the Indo-European languages, Catalan verbs undergo inflection according to the following categories:
* Tense: past, present, future.
* Number: singular or plural.
* Person: first, second or third.
* Mood: indicative, subjunctive, or imperative.
* Aspect: Perfective aspect or imperfective aspect (distinguished only in the past tense as remote preterite or imperfect).
* Voice: active or passive.


Like all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, while morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.

The Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects replace the analytic perfect indicative with a periphrastic tense composed of &quot;vaig, vas (vares), va, vam (vàrem), vau (vàreu), van (varen)&quot; and the infinitive.

Catalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes &quot;-a-&quot;, &quot;-e-&quot;, &quot;-i-&quot;, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), while the third (the subtype of &quot;servir&quot;, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.

=== Verbal periphrases ===
Verbal periphrases of obligation:

* &quot;Caldre&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + infinitive (personal)
* &quot;Caldre&quot; + infinitive (impersonal) 

* &quot;Haver&quot; + &quot;de&quot; + infinitive (personal)
* &quot;Haver-se&quot; + &quot;de&quot; + infinitive (impersonal) 

* &quot;Fer falta&quot; (impersonal) 

* &quot;Ser menester&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + verb in subjunctive (personal)
* &quot;Ser menester&quot; + infinitive (impersonal) 

* &quot;Ser necessari&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + verb in subjunctive (personal)
* &quot;Ser necessari&quot; + infinitive (impersonal) 

(*) Although it is not correct the usage of the verbal periphrasis *&quot;tenir&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + infinitive (obligation) in the Standard (instead of &quot;haver&quot; + &quot;de&quot;, which is roughly equivalent to English &quot;have to&quot;), it is widely used in colloquial Catalan and Valencian. The same occurs with *&quot;haver-hi&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + infinitive.

Verbal periphrases of probability:

* &quot;Deure&quot; + infinitive 

* &quot;Potser&quot; / &quot;Segurament&quot; / &quot;Probablement&quot; + verb in indicative 

* &quot;Poder&quot; + &quot;ser&quot; + verb in subjunctive 

* &quot;Ser probable&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + verb in subjunctive 

* &quot;Ser possible&quot; + &quot;que&quot; + verb in subjunctive 

* &quot;Poder&quot; + infinitive (it is also a periphrasis of capability) 

Verbal periphrases of imminence, intention or future: 

* &quot;Ara&quot; + verb in present or future (immediate action) 

* &quot;De seguida&quot; + verb in present or future (immediate action) 

* &quot;Tot seguit&quot; + verb in present or future (immediate action) 

* Verb in present or future (not necessarily immediate action) 

* &quot;Pensar&quot; + infinitive (periphrasis of intention) 

* &quot;Anar&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + infinitive 

* &quot;Estar a punt de&quot; + infinitive (immediate action) 

Other modal and aspectual verbal periphrases:

* &quot;Vindre a&quot; + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of approximation value, with the verb &quot;dir&quot;, to say, it has a justification aspect) 

* &quot;Gosar&quot; + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of audacity) 

* &quot;Saber&quot; + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of ingressive value)

<doc id="430040" wikidata="Q5565132" url="?curid=430040" title="Gitlow v. New York">
<text>Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had extended the First Amendment&#x27;s provisions protecting freedom of speech and freedom of the press to apply to the governments of U.S. states. Along with &quot;Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago&quot; (1897), it was one of the first major cases involving the incorporation of the Bill of Rights. It was also one of a series of Supreme Court cases that defined the scope of the First Amendment&#x27;s protection of free speech and established the standard to which a state or the federal government would be held when it criminalized speech or writing.

The case arose from the conviction under New York state law of Socialist politician and journalist Benjamin Gitlow for the publication of a &quot;left-wing manifesto&quot; in 1919. In a majority opinion joined by six other justices, Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford upheld the conviction under the bad tendency test, writing that government may suppress or punish speech that directly advocates the unlawful overthrow of the government. Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. dissented, arguing that state and federal governments should only be permitted to limit free speech under the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test that he had previously laid out in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (1919).

In his majority opinion, Sanford laid out the grounds for incorporation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, holding that they were among the rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Later Supreme Court cases such as &quot;De Jonge v. Oregon&quot; (1937) would incorporate other provisions of the Bill of Rights on the same basis as &quot;Gitlow&quot;.

==Background==
New York&#x27;s Criminal Anarchy Law was passed in 1902 following the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York, in September 1901. Under the Criminal Anarchy Law, people seen as activists supporting the destruction of American government through revolutionary means could be arrested in an attempt to prevent American Bolsheviks from gaining a national following.

Following the Red Scare of 1919–20, a variety of leftists, either anarchists, sympathizers with the Bolshevik Revolution, labor activists, or members of a communist or socialist party, were convicted for violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 on the basis of their writings or statements. Benjamin Gitlow, a member of the Socialist Party of America, who had served in the New York State Assembly, was charged with criminal anarchy under New York&#x27;s Criminal Anarchy Law of 1902 for publishing in July 1919 a document called &quot;Left wing manifesto&quot; in &quot;The Revolutionary Age&quot;, a newspaper for which he served as business manager. Gitlow&#x27;s trial counsel was renowned defense attorney Clarence Darrow. His trial lasted from January 22 to February 5, 1920.

His defense contended that the Manifesto represented historical analysis rather than advocacy. Moreover, he claimed that he should not be arrested for his writing since the manifesto&#x27;s distribution was not the inciting incident for any actions against the government. The prosecution refuted Gitlow&#x27;s claim, stating, &quot;Prosecutions have been for the use of words or printed arguments urging actions which if carried out by the reader or hearer would have resulted in the commission of a crime.&quot; The prosecution claimed that the Manifesto&#x27;s intent was to convince American readers to commit crimes, and that in itself should be punishable by law. It took the jury three hours to convict Gitlow on February 11, 1920, and sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. He served more than two years at Sing Sing prison before his motion to appeal was granted and he was released on bail. State courts of appeal upheld his conviction.

&quot;Gitlow&quot; was the first major First Amendment case that the American Civil Liberties Union argued before the Supreme Court.

The Court had to consider whether it could review a challenge to a state law on the basis that it violated the federal constitution. If it determined that such a challenge lay within the scope of its authority, then it had to review the application of the law to the case at hand, the specific violation of the statute.

==Supreme Court ruling==
===Free speech===
The Supreme Court upheld Gitlow&#x27;s conviction 7–2, with Louis Brandeis and Oliver W. Holmes dissenting on the grounds that even &quot;indefinite&quot; advocacy of overthrowing government should be protected speech.

The Court upheld Gitlow&#x27;s conviction on the basis that the government may suppress or punish speech that directly advocates the unlawful overthrow of the government and it upheld the constitutionality of the state statute at issue, which made it a crime to advocate the duty, need, or appropriateness of overthrowing government by force or violence.

Justice Edward Terry Sanford&#x27;s majority opinion attempted to define more clearly the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test developed a few years earlier in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;. He embraced &quot;the bad tendency test&quot; found in &quot;Shaffer v. United States&quot;, which held that a &quot;State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means&quot; because such speech clearly &quot;present[s] a sufficient danger to the public peace and to the security of the State.&quot;

According to Sanford, a &quot;single revolutionary spark may kindle a fire that, smoldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive conflagration.&quot; He said the Manifesto contained &quot;the language of direct incitement&quot; and was not &quot;the expression of philosophical abstraction.&quot; Relying on the argument that incendiary speech may be suppressed “preemptively” Justice Sanford asserted that governments cannot be required to wait until revolutionary publications “lead to actual disturbances of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction” but can “suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency” or “extinguish the spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration.”

In his dissent, Holmes, the author of &quot;Schenck&quot;&#x27;s clear and present danger test, wrote that he believed it was still the appropriate test to employ in judging the limits of freedom of expression. Joined by Brandeis, he argued that Gitlow presented no present danger because only a small minority of people shared the views presented in the manifesto and because it directed an uprising at some &quot;indefinite time in the future.&quot; Moreover, he responded to Sanford&#x27;s kindling metaphor by refuting the claim that the Manifesto is an example of &quot;incitement.&quot;

Holmes states, &quot;It is said that this manifesto was more than a theory, that it was an incitement. Every idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief and if believed it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth. The only difference between an expression of opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker&#x27;s enthusiasm for the result. Eloquence may set fire to reason, but, whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us, it had no chance of starting a present conflagration. If, in the long run, the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.&quot;

===Incorporation===

The Supreme Court previously held, in &quot;Barron v. Baltimore&quot;, that the Constitution&#x27;s Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government, that states were free to enforce statutes that restricted the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, and that the federal courts could not interfere with the enforcement of such statutes. &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot; partly reversed that precedent and began a trend toward its near complete reversal. The Supreme Court now holds that almost every provision of the Bill of Rights applies to both the federal government and the states, with the exception of the Third and Seventh Amendments, and the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s grand jury provision.

The Supreme Court relied on the &quot;due process clause&quot; of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits a state from depriving &quot;any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; The Court stated that &quot;For present purposes we may and do assume that&quot; the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press were &quot;among the fundamental personal rights and &#x27;liberties&#x27; protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the states&quot;.

==Aftermath==

On November 9, 1925, Gitlow surrendered to New York Authorities for transportation back to Sing Sing Prison to finish his sentence. On December 11, 1925, New York Gov. Al Smith pardoned him, saying that while Gitlow had been &quot;properly and legally convicted&quot;, he needed to consider &quot;whether or not he has been sufficiently punished for a political crime.&quot; He concluded that &quot;no additional punishment would act as a deterrent to those who would preach an erroneous doctrine of Government.&quot; Gitlow was later briefly elected General Secretary of the American Communist Party in 1929.

The Court used the doctrine first enunciated in &quot;Gitlow&quot; in other cases, such as &quot;De Jonge v. Oregon&quot;, &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot;, and &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, to extend the reach of the Bill of Rights. Constitutional scholars refer to this as the &quot;incorporation doctrine,&quot; meaning that the Supreme Court has identified rights specified in the Bill of Rights and &quot;incorporated&quot; them into the liberties covered by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot; that the 2nd Amendment Right to &quot;keep and bear arms,&quot; for lawful purposes such as self-defense is both a fundamental and individual right of all law-abiding Citizens over 21 years of age and of sound mind as self-defense is the &quot;central component&quot; of the 2nd Amendment, and these Rights are &quot;fully applicable&quot; in all of the 50 States.

<doc id="430042" wikidata="Q365772" url="?curid=430042" title="Danny Williams (Canadian politician)">
<text>Daniel E. Williams (born August 4, 1949) is a Canadian politician, businessman, and lawyer who served as the ninth premier of Newfoundland and Labrador between November 6, 2003, and December 3, 2010.

Williams was born and raised in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Before entering politics Williams was a highly successful lawyer and businessman.
After becoming Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001, he was elected to the House of Assembly in a by-election for the district of Humber West in Corner Brook.

Williams&#x27;s premiership was controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador. Events such as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings, and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, garnered national attention. While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador, he was continuously ranked as one of the most popular premiers, with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties.

==Early life and education==
Daniel E. Williams was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada, the eldest of four children to Thomas Williams and Teresita (Galway). He received his early education from Saint Bonaventure&#x27;s College and then Gonzaga High School. The Williams family have been Progressive Conservatives since the province&#x27;s confederation with Canada; Williams handed out brochures and put up signs in support of John Diefenbaker&#x27;s campaign to be prime minister.

Williams went on to study at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he received a degree in political science and economics. In 1969, he was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship and went to Keble College, Oxford, United Kingdom to read Arts in Law. Whilst at Oxford, he played hockey for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. He then attended Dalhousie University, Halifax where he earned a Bachelor of Laws degree.

==Professional and business career==
&quot;(All currency is in Canadian dollars)&quot;

While still in law school, Williams led a consortium of businesspeople that was granted one of Newfoundland&#x27;s first cable television licences and started the company &quot;Avalon Cablevision&quot;. Through major acquisitions and the very early adoption of the Internet ISP business (via theZone dial-up and later RoadRunner high-speed cable Internet services), he built Cable Atlantic into one of the largest communications companies in Atlantic Canada. As the principal owner, he sold the telecommunications portion of the business for $76 million in April 2000, to GT Group Telecom Inc. The cable TV portion of Cable Atlantic was sold to Rogers Cable Inc. for $152 million in November 2000. This sale plus the success of his extensive law practice gave him the nickname of &quot;Danny Millions&quot; during the early 2000s.

Williams has been practising law since 1972, becoming a financially successful lawyer, and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1984. His firm represented many of the abused altar boys and orphans who sued the Roman Catholic Church, the Christian Brothers and the province of Newfoundland following the Mount Cashel Orphanage scandal.

Williams served as president of OIS Fisher, an oil and natural gas company (later renamed Spectrol Group), and has invested in golf courses and resorts throughout the province. He has also served as the Chairman of the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPAC), the Newfoundland and Labrador Film Development Corporation as well as the Provincial Government Offshore Oil Impact Advisory Council.

While he was the owner of Cable Atlantic, Williams purchased the naming rights to a sports complex in St. John&#x27;s for $600,000 from Molson. Before the centre opened, however, Williams had sold Cable Atlantic to Rogers Communications to pursue his political career, but retained the naming rights. Ultimately, he chose to name the centre Mile One Centre, based on the venue&#x27;s location at the beginning of the Trans Canada Highway.

== Early political career ==

=== Leader of the Opposition ===
In 2000, after years of speculation Williams announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador (PC), and was returned uncontested on April 7, 2001. On June 19, 2001, he won a by-election in the Corner Brook district of Humber West.

Support for the PC party saw a big bounce when Williams became leader. Four by-elections were held during the two years he was the Opposition Leader and each seat was won by a PC candidate. In September 2001, Liberal Assemblyman (MHA) Ross Wiseman crossed the floor of the House of Assembly to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. During his time as Opposition Leader, Williams donated his legislative salary to charity.

===2003 election===

Since succeeding Beaton Tulk as Premier of Newfoundland in February 2001, Premier Roger Grimes had been under opposition pressure to legitimize his mandate at the polls after winning the leadership of the Liberal Party (Liberals). On September 29, 2003, Grimes called an election for October 21, 2003.

Polls leading up to and during the election showed that the Progressive Conservatives under Williams had a substantial lead over their main competitor the Liberals, as well as the New Democratic Party (NDP). Williams campaigned for change and promised to control spending, streamline the public service and create jobs.

The Progressive Conservatives captured nearly 59% of the vote and won 34 of the 48 seats in the 2003 general election. This win marked only the third change of government in the 54 years since the province joined Canada, and ended nearly 15 years of Liberal Party rule. As party leader, Williams became the province&#x27;s ninth Premier.

==Premier==
===First term===
Soon after being elected, Williams announced the province&#x27;s debts were so burdensome that he had no choice but to cut spending and freeze wages. Based on the projected $840 million budget deficit for 2004, the government announced sweeping cuts. A number of projects would be cut, and others delayed. Cuts included three health care facilities and a school; delayed projects included, most notably, the opening of The Rooms, the province&#x27;s cultural facility that was under construction. Spurred by the administration&#x27;s announcement of pay-freeze and plan to eliminate 4,000 public sector jobs, a strike was declared among the 20,000 public sector employees two days following the announcement, at midnight April 1, 2004. The strike ended nearly a month later when Williams reneged on a campaign promise and legislated the employees back to work. Later that year, the Williams government compressed health and education boards in an attempt for a more efficient delivery of services, a move that still receives criticism in the province. 

An opinion poll conducted in June 2004 showed that support for the Premier and the Progressive Conservatives had plunged. From its nearly 60 percent share of the vote in the general election seven months earlier, support had shrunk to 41 percent, almost tied with the Liberals at 39 percent. His personal support as choice of Premier fell to 39 percent, a marked fall from 65 percent he enjoyed just six months earlier.

Williams&#x27; popularity increased when he fought with then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin over a campaign promise Martin had made that would lead to a revised Atlantic Accord. Martin proposed an eight-year deal that the province would keep 100 percent of offshore oil revenues, but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario. Williams, supported by the other provincial leaders, walked out of talks with Martin, saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in lost revenue over the life of its three oil fields. Williams along with Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm, who also wanted the same deal as Newfoundland and Labrador, met with the Prime Minister on several occasions but a deal between Ottawa and the two provinces could not be reached. Williams raised the temperature on December 23, 2004, when he ordered the removal of all Canadian flags from provincial government buildings. On January 10, 2005, Canadian flags started flying once again in the province, and several weeks later Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia reached a deal with Ottawa. A March opinion poll indicated that support for the Williams government had rebounded to 86 percent.

On March 3, 2006, Williams appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; where Paul McCartney and then-wife Heather Mills argued the seal hunt was inhumane because seal cubs were being clubbed to death. Williams said the annual hunt is supported by scientists, veterinarians and organizations like the UN and the World Wildlife Fund, and that 90% of seals are killed by bullet. Williams accused the McCartneys of being used by IFAW, Greenpeace and PETA to help them raise funds. He then invited the McCartneys to visit Newfoundland and Labrador.

===2007 election===
On August 21, 2007, Williams signed a Memorandum of understanding for the Hebron offshore oilfield with several major oil companies in which government royalties were exchanged for a 4.9 percent equity stake in the project. On September 17, 2007, Williams called a provincial election. Williams&#x27; popularity was riding at 75%, and polls during the campaign showed the Conservatives reaching up to 86 percent of voter support.

After the vote count, the Progressive Conservatives emerged with nine more seats than they held at the dissolution of the previous legislature. The party had won 69.5 percent of the popular vote, the highest popular vote share ever attained by the PC party in the province. Three Liberal incumbents, as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael, successfully held their seats. Notably, however, Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district. The next month Williams&#x27; Progressive Conservatives increased their seat count to 44 out of 48, after winning a deferred election in Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans following the death of Liberal candidate Gerry Tobin on October 1.

===Second term===
On August 20, 2008, Williams and a consortium of oil companies led by Chevron Canada signed a deal to develop the Hebron oil field – the second largest oil field off the coast of the province with an estimated 700 million barrels of oil reserves, worth some $20 billion in royalties and up to 3,500 jobs from the project. Construction is scheduled to start in 2012, with oil extraction by 2017.

During the 2008 Canadian Federal election, Williams hit out at incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the federal administration for reneging on a 2006 election pledge to exclude non-renewable energy sources from the equalization formula. In order to thwart Harper&#x27;s reelection, Williams launched the &quot;ABC&quot; campaign: Anything But Conservative. The ABC campaign encouraged people to vote for any other party but the Conservatives, with a goal of making sure no Conservative was elected in Newfoundland and Labrador. The campaign, which was supported by all but one member of Williams&#x27; caucus, crippled the federal party&#x27;s ability to find candidates and volunteers. On election night the campaign was successful, the Conservative Party lost the three seats they had held prior to the election, and won only 17% of the popular vote in the province. Despite being shut out of Newfoundland and Labrador the Conservatives did manage to win a second minority government. Following the election Williams announced that it was time to end his battle with Ottawa, and both him and Harper signalled a willingness to work with each other.

On June 16, 2009, Williams announced the government had concluded an agreement with oil companies to expand the Hibernia oil field in which the province would have a 10 percent equity stake in the &quot;Hibernia South&quot; extension. The deal promised to add $13 billion to the province&#x27;s coffers.

Williams has been outspoken about the Québec Government and their crown corporation Hydro-Québec. On September 3, 2009, Williams accused Hydro-Québec of trying to block the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project to protect its own dominance in the marketplace by making a deal with New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham to buy NB Power&#x27;s nuclear and hydro generating stations, the transmission system and other assets in a massive deal. On October 29, 2009, the premiers of New Brunswick and Québec signed a memorandum of understanding to transfer most assets of NB Power to Hydro-Québec. In the end, the deal between New Brunswick and Québec fell apart, Williams dissatisfaction with the deal is thought to have played a role. In a speech given on June 9, 2010, Williams strongly denounced &quot;Québec&#x27;s self interest is harming the provinces, the nation and our country&#x27;s international reputation&quot;.

On February 2, 2010, it was reported that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada&#x27;s health care system. According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale, &quot;It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province.&quot; Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada. On February 8, 2010, it was reported that Williams&#x27; surgery had been successful. On his return, Williams later defended his choice saying: &quot;I did not sign away my right to get the best possible health care for myself when I entered politics&quot;. Williams said although he had &quot;the utmost confidence&quot; in his own province&#x27;s health care system, his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami to undergo &quot;a very specialized piece of surgery [by] somebody who&#x27;s doing this three or four times a day, five, six days a week.&quot;
On November 18, 2010, Williams was joined by Premier of Nova Scotia, Darrell Dexter, in announcing a $6.2 billion agreement to develop the first phase of the Lower Churchill Project. Nalcor Energy, a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation, signed a partnership agreement with Emera Inc. of Nova Scotia to develop the 824 megawatts Muskrat Falls. The hydro development would see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater transmission link through the Strait of Belle Isle. Another underwater transmission link across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia. Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station. Emera Inc. will get 20 percent of the power for $1.2 billion to sell to customers in Nova Scotia. The remaining 40 percent will be sold by Nalcor Energy to markets in Atlantic Canada and the Northeastern United States.

===Popularity===
Williams&#x27; popularity is said to be unmatched in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams&#x27; premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for his first year in office, his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government had been consistently in the 70 to 80 percent range for the majority of the time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remained by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country for the majority of the time he was in office.

During his first year in office Williams and his government suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams and his government dramatically improved in 2005. A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments. The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William&#x27;s premiership. Polling conducted throughout 2007 showed that support for Williams and his government remained high. In August 2007, the CRA found that 86 percent were satisfied with the government&#x27;s performance; 77 percent supported Williams as premier, and 76 percent endorsed the PC party.

A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 showed that 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams&#x27; Progressive Conservatives. His popularity had been in the seventies according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009. Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, the first of which was by Global News and Ipsos and the second was by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found that Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams&#x27; performance; the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall with 58 percent.

A CRA poll released in March 2010 showed public support for Williams&#x27; Progressive Conservative Party that had extended to a record 80 percent of decided voters, up from 77 percent from February. Satisfaction with the government was 93 percent voters. After controversies arose surrounding the accidental expropriation of the Grand Falls-Windsor paper mill and the province&#x27;s readiness to react to a possible oil spill, the Williams led government as well as his personal popularity took a slight hit. A CRA poll conducted in May 2010, showed that satisfaction with the government was at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March, the party&#x27;s support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent. Even with the slight loss in support, Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.

===Resignation===
On November 25, 2010, Williams announced that he would step down as premier on December 3, 2010, and that Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale would serve as the premier of the province until a new party leader was elected in 2011. On December 3, 2010, Williams tendered his resignation as Premier and Dunderdale was sworn in as the tenth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, becoming the first woman to hold the office.

The week following Williams&#x27; departure from politics, CRA released a poll conducted during November showing that 90 percent of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were either completely or mostly satisfied with the performance of the PC government. 75 percent of the respondents supported the Progressive Conservatives, while 76 percent thought Williams was the best choice to be premier.

==Post-premiership==

===Politics===
In February 2011, Williams publicly campaigned with Vaughn Granter, who was the PC Candidate in Williams&#x27; former district of Humber West. Williams announced in March 2011, that he had decided not to attend a Progressive Conservative tribute dinner in his honour that was set for April 1. The tribute dinner was to be held in conjunction with the leadership convention that would swear Dunderdale in as PC leader. Following this, Williams announced that Premier Dunderdale and her staff were distancing themselves from him.

On September 5, 2011, Williams campaigned with Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership candidate Gary Mar in Fort McMurray, Alberta. In October 2015, during the federal election, Williams called Stephen Harper&#x27;s tactic of making the niqab ban for Muslim women at citizenship ceremonies a national issue borderline racist for how it isolated women and minorities.

===Hockey===

In May 2011, Williams became a major figure in an effort to bring an American Hockey League (AHL) team back to St. John&#x27;s. The provincial government rejected a request by St. John&#x27;s Sports and Entertainment&#x27;s for a $500,000 annual subsidy, in a move that &quot;shocked&quot; Williams. However, on June 1, Williams announced tentative deals with St. John&#x27;s Sports and Entertainment and True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, the owner of the AHL franchise known as the Manitoba Moose. On June 10, a formal announcement was made confirming the deal to move the Manitoba Moose to Mile One Centre. On July 29, Williams held a second event at Mile One Centre where he announced that the team would be named the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps, and unveiled the team&#x27;s logo. However, since Williams only owned the team branding and not the AHL franchise itself, the team only lasted six seasons before there was no AHL franchise owners willing to place a team in Newfoundland as the NHL teams trended towards having its AHL affiliate closer to the parent team.

===Real estate===
In December 2011, Williams announced that he was behind a proposal to develop 2,400 acres of land in St. John&#x27;s. The mixed-use development would include residential, commercial and industrial space. The value of the development is estimated at $5 billion over 10 to 20 years.

===Mining===
Williams joined Alderon Iron Ore Corp as a Special Advisor to the Executive Chairman in 2012, the company is currently involved in mining exploration in the Labrador Trough.
In July 2012, Danny Williams along with Alderon, filed a lawsuit against Sierra Club Canada along with environmental activist Bruno Marcocchio and political blogger Brad Cabana for defamation from comments both on live radio and on Cabana&#x27;s blog.

===Documentary film===

Williams is the subject of a 2014 National Film Board of Canada documentary film entitled &quot;Danny&quot;. Co-directed by Justin Simms and William D. MacGillivray, the film premiered in Halifax on September 13, 2014, at the Atlantic Film Festival. The film chronicles Williams&#x27; seven years as premier.

===Legacy===
The high amounts of spending done by Williams&#x27;s government while he was in power have been cited by some critics for the financial situation that Newfoundland and Labrador has been in since 2015. Premier Dwight Ball claimed that the Williams spending era would be paid down by oil prices of $148/barrel USD The Lower Churchill Project has doubled in price while oil prices (which make up a significant amount of the province&#x27;s GDP) have fallen. In June 2016, a poster of Williams&#x27;s face was put up by anonymous protesters near the Confederation Building alongside posters of Dwight Ball and Cathy Bennett. The poster with William&#x27;s face on it had the slogan &quot;The Running Mouth&quot;. However, governments and Premiers subsequent to Williams&#x27; time in office contributed enormously to the current economic predicament of the province. When Williams entered office, the province found itself in serious decline in terms of infrastructure and social safety nets. Under his leadership, many progressive policies were implemented. In addition to addressing crumbling provincial infrastructure (which bolstered investment and confidence in the province), Williams also championed many impactful policies. Among others, these policies include: a Poverty Reduction Strategy (which became a national model); the most progressive Student Aid package in the country; a reimagined provincial Tourism Campaign (which produced internationally acclaimed and award winning ads). Upon his departure from office, the Governor of the Bank of Canada heralded the province as an economic model for Canada.

<doc id="430046" wikidata="Q5303104" url="?curid=430046" title="Downer (animal)">
<text>A downer is an animal, usually livestock, that cannot stand on its own and therefore is to be killed. A downed animal, one that is unable to stand, is not necessarily a downer.
== Causes ==
The animal&#x27;s inability to stand may be caused by illness or injury. In nearly all cases it is considered by most farmers to be both humane and cost-effective to kill the animal when it becomes a downer, rather than keeping it alive and unhealthy. Once killed, and depending on how the animal became a downer and how it was killed, the animal may then be incinerated, buried, rendered, or slaughtered. Because of mad cow disease, the slaughter of downer cattle is a topic of great concern.

There are many possible reasons for an animal staying down, including:
*Mastitis
*Metritis
*Hypomagnesaemia
*Postparturient Hypocalcemia
*Ketosis
*Dystocia
**Nerve damage
**Pelvic fracture
*Long bone fracture
*Neurological disease

Use of certain animal feed additives has been linked to downers such as the use of ractopamine in pigs.

== Situations in different countries ==
===United States===

A longstanding issue is whether these animals are treated humanely or inhumanely by shippers, stockyards, and packers while they are being moved or held for slaughter. Legislation periodically is introduced in Congress to outlaw the sale or transfer of such animals, but livestock producer groups have long contended that their voluntary efforts to end harmful practices have already proven successful. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10815) required the USDA to investigate and submit a report on nonambulatory livestock, and to issue and enforce regulations, if deemed necessary, to provide for their humane treatment.

Different jurisdictions have different rules about what can be done with a downer cow. In some jurisdictions the cow may be slaughtered without question. In others, downer cattle may not be slaughtered even if the cause is a physical injury. In the United States, meat inspection is usually an interstate commerce issue, and is regulated by the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Now all livestock auction barns are not allowed to take sick or downer cows because of the rulings that originated with the BSE &quot;mad cow&quot; crisis.

===Canada===

In Canada, transportation of animals is federally regulated. The Health of Animals Regulations state that an animal has to be fit for the intended journey and that a non-ambulatory animal cannot be transported because transport would cause additional suffering.

The Canadian authority responsible for the welfare of animals that are transported is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

==Mad cow disease and downers==
The downer issue took on another dimension when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which often makes infected cattle downers, was found in two North American cows in 2003. Many experts believe that nonambulatory cattle are at higher risk of harboring BSE. As a result, on December 30, 2003, the USDA announced an immediate ban on the slaughter of downer cattle for human food use. At issue is how to monitor the hundreds of thousands of U.S. downer cattle (annual estimate) if they are no longer presented for observation and testing at meat packing plants; also at issue is what to do with their remains, and whether they have any non-food value.

<text>David Yonggi Cho (; 14 February 1936 – 14 September 2021 as Paul Yungi Cho) was a South Korean Pentecostal Pastor. He was the founder of the Yoido Full Gospel Church (Assemblies of God), which he started in a tent with 5 people (including his future mother-in-law Choi Ja-shil and her children as its first members), which eventually became the world&#x27;s largest congregation, with a membership of 830,000 ().

==Early life==
Cho was born on 14 February 1936, in Ulju County, now part of Ulsan. The son of Cho Doo-chun and Kim Bok-sun, Cho was the eldest of five brothers and four sisters. He graduated from middle school with honours. Because his father&#x27;s sock and glove business went bankrupt, he could not afford high school or university tuition. Subsequently, he enrolled in an inexpensive technical high school to learn a trade. At the same time, he began frequenting an American army base near his school, and learned English from soldiers whom he befriended. He mastered English quickly, and became an interpreter for the commander of the army base and the principal of his school.

Raised initially as a Buddhist, a visit from a Christian girl led Cho to convert to Christianity at the age of 17, before he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sensing God calling him to the ministry, Cho began working as an interpreter for the American evangelist Ken Tize. In 1956, he received a scholarship to study theology at Full Gospel Bible College in Seoul. While there, he met Choi Ja-shil, who became his mother-in-law and a close ministerial associate. He graduated in March 1958.

==Wider ministry==
Cho spent more than 44 years emphasizing the importance of cell group ministry, which he believed was the key to church growth, as well as team ministry.

In November 1976, Cho founded Church Growth International, an organization dedicated to teaching the principles of evangelism and church growth to pastors all over the world. In January 1986, he led the way in establishing the Elim Welfare Town, a facility for the elderly, young, homeless, and unemployed. The latter would be given training and a choice of four occupations. In 1988, he founded newspaper company, Kukmin Ilbo. He was Chairman of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship from 1992 to 2000 and did not pursue another term, and had served as Chairman of the Korean Christian Leaders Association since November 1998. In February 1999, he began serving as Chairman of the Good People charity organization.

In 2008, Cho retired, with Young Hoon Lee succeeding him as senior pastor.

== Death ==
Cho died on 14 September 2021 at the age of 85 due to complications from a stroke.

==Controversies==

In March 2011, Cho became a subject of controversy when he reportedly made comments suggesting that the 2011 Tōhoku tsunami &quot;could be a warning from God to Japan, which has become an increasingly materialistic, secular and idol-worshiping country.&quot;
However, as the context of the interview was distorted, a text of apology was announced by The News Mission.

In September 2011, 29 church elders filed a lawsuit by South Korean prosecutors. The prosecutors began an investigation of Cho&#x27;s alleged embezzlement of 23 billion won ($20 million USD) from the Yoido Full Gospel Church&#x27;s funds. A national broadcaster, MBC, released a documentary that claimed the money had been used to buy properties for Bethesda University in Anaheim, California, United States, which Cho founded.

In 2014, Cho was convicted of embezzling $12 million USD in church funds that he bought from his son Cho Jong-Un.

<text>The practice of Christianity in Korea is marginal in North Korea, but significant in South Korea, where it revolves around Protestantism and Catholicism, accounting for 8.6 million and 5.8 million members, respectively. Christianity in the form of Catholicism was first introduced during the late Joseon Dynasty period by Confucian scholars who encountered it in China. In 1603, Yi Su-gwang, a Korean politician, returned from Beijing carrying several theological books written by Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary to China. He began disseminating the information in the books, introducing Christianity to Korea. In 1787, King Jeongjo of Joseon officially outlawed Catholicism as an &quot;evil practice,&quot; declaring it heretical and strictly banned. Catholicism was reintroduced in 1785 by Yi Seung-hun and French and Chinese Catholic priests were soon invited by the Korean Christians.

Joseon royalty saw the new religion as a subversive influence and persecuted its earliest followers in Korea, culminating in the Catholic Persecution of 1866, in which 8,000 Catholics across the country were killed, including nine French missionary priests. Later in the 19th century, the opening of Korea to the outside world gradually brought more religious toleration toward Christians.

Sorae Church, which was the first Protestant church in Korea, was established by Seo Sang-ryun on 16 May 1883. Lee Soo-jung, one of the first Protestants in Korea, was baptized in Japan on 29 April 1883, and wrote an English article on the &quot;Missionary Review of the World&quot; to urge more American missionaries to enter Korea on 13 December 1883. Robert Samuel Maclay and Horace Newton Allen entered Korea one year later in 1884. Horace Allen was a North Presbyterian missionary who later became an American diplomat. He served in Korea until 1905, by which time he had been joined by many others. The Anglican Church of Korea can be traced back to 1890, when Charles Corfe, the first bishop of Joseon (Korea) landed in Korea; the first Anglican church in Korea was established in 1891 at Nae-dong, Jung-gu, Incheon. 

The growth of Christian denominations was gradual before 1945. In that year, approximately 2% of the population was Christian. Rapid growth ensued after the war, when Korea was freed from Japanese occupation by the Allies: by 1991, 18.4% of the population (8.0 million) was Protestant, and 6.7% (2.5 million) was Catholic. The Catholic Church has increased its membership by 70% in the ten years leading up to 2007. Meanwhile, Eastern Orthodoxy accounts for about 4,000 adherents in South Korea, or 0.005% of the total population. Numerous unorthodox sects, such as the Unification Church founded in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon, have also developed in Korea. As of 2024, 31% of the South Korean population is Christian.

The influence on education has been decisive, as Christian missionaries started 293 schools and 40 universities including three of the top five academic institutions. Christianity was associated with more widespread education and Western modernization. Catholicism and Protestantism are seen as the religion of the middle class, youth, intellectuals, and urbanites, and has been central to South Korea&#x27;s pursuit of modernity and westernization after the end of World War II and the liberation of Korea. In the early 21st century, however, the growth of Protestantism has slowed, perhaps due to scandals involving church leadership, fundamentalism, and conflict among various sects. Some analysts also attribute this to overly zealous missionary work.

==Cultural significance==
Professor James H. Grayson from the School of East Asian Studies at University of Sheffield states that Protestantism has been a dynamic force in Korean life, and had a positive influence on other religions. Catholics and Buddhists had to compete for loyalty and attention, and it inspired numerous smaller sects. They adopted many of the methods pioneered by the Protestants. The influence on higher education in Korea has been decisive as the Christians started 293 schools and 40 universities, including 3 of the top 5 academic institutions. Sukman argues that since 1945, Catholicism and Protestantism has been widely seen by Koreans as the religion of the middle class, youth, intellectuals, urbanites, and modernizers. It has been a powerful force supporting South Korea&#x27;s pursuit of modernity and westernization, and opposition to the old Japanese colonialism and the communism of North Korea.

Prior to the Korean War (1950–1953), two-thirds of Korean Christians lived in the North, but most later fled to the South. It is not known exactly how many Christians remain in North Korea today. There is uncertainty about the exact number in South Korea. By the end of the 1960s, there were an estimated half a million Catholics and one million Protestants in South Korea, but during the &quot;Conversion Boom&quot; period ending in the 1980s, the number of Catholics and Protestants increased faster in South Korea than in any other country. The 2005 South Korean census showed 29.2 percent of the population identifying as Christian, up from 26.3 percent ten years previously. Catholics tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in South Korea, in the sense that they have a high number of college graduates (50.4%) and post-graduate degrees (11.6%) per capita. The Presbyterian Church has the highest number of members of any Protestant denomination in South Korea, with close to 20,000 churches affiliated with the two largest Presbyterian denominations in the country. The Orthodox Christianity under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is a small minority religion in South Korea with about 4,000 official members in 2013.

South Korea provides the world&#x27;s second-largest number of Christian missionaries, surpassed only by the United States. GMS, the missionary body of the &quot;Hapdong&quot; General Assembly of Presbyterian Church of Korea, is the single largest missionary organization in South Korea.

South Korean missionaries have been serving in 10/40 Window nations, which are more hostile to Westerners. In 2000, there were 10,646 South Korean Protestant missionaries in 156 countries, along with an undisclosed number of Catholic missionaries. According to a 2004 article, &quot;South Korea dispatched more than 12,000 missionaries to over 160 countries in comparison to about 46,000 American and 6,000 British missionaries, according to missionary organizations in South Korea and the West&quot;. According to a 2007 article, &quot;Korea has 16,000 missionaries working overseas, second only to the US&quot;. In 1980, South Korea sent 93 missionaries and by 2009, some 20,000 Korean missionaries.

Aaron Tan, director of the Hong Kong architectural firm called Research Architecture Design, described the night scene of Seoul as &quot;full of glowing Christian crosses&quot;.

==Growth of Christianity==
===Appeal in the North===
Christianity, especially Catholicism and Protestantism, had a special appeal to Koreans in the North. Between 1440 and 1560, there were migrations to the northern provinces, which were designed to strengthen the border. This created a society of mixed backgrounds without an aristocracy and without long-standing religious institutions. However, it did have a strong and ambitious merchant class, as well as a strong military tradition. Local elites gained administrative positions and adopted Confucian literati lifestyles but were not easy to attain high-level positions. During Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945, the North became the more industrial region of Korea. The area was highly receptive to Catholic and Protestant missionaries in the late 19th century, who brought Western knowledge, and established hospitals and Western-style medical care, schools, and a window to the wider world. The middle-class elites sent their sons to the Catholic or Protestant schools. In turn the sons became strong nationalists who considered the United States a rallying point in opposition to Japanese colonial imperialism. In a reversal of previous Southern dominance, the North produced many influential figures in Korean history. After 1945, North Korea&#x27;s Soviet-influenced state policy of atheism as a major facet of Juche caused most Christians to flee to South Korea in pursuit of religious freedom.

===Academic sympathy===
Matteo Ricci&#x27;s books, which he created to use Chinese ideograms and concepts to introduce Catholicism, provoked academic controversy when Yi Gwang-jeong brought them into Korea. Academics remained critical of the new thought for many years. Early in the 17th century, Yi Su-gwang, a court scholar, and Yu Mong-in, a cabinet minister, wrote highly critical commentaries on Ricci&#x27;s works. During the next two centuries, academic criticism of Catholic beliefs continued, as it overturned Confucian veneration of elders and tradition. Some scholars, however, were more sympathetic to Catholicism. Members of the Silhak (실학; &quot;practical learning&quot;) school believed in social structure based on merit rather than birth (see class discrimination), and were therefore often opposed by the mainstream academic establishment.

Silhak scholars perceived Catholicism as providing an ideological basis for their beliefs and were therefore attracted to what they saw as the egalitarian values of Catholicism. When Catholicism was finally established in Korea in the 18th century, there was already a substantial body of educated opinion sympathetic to it, which was crucial to the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s. An 1801 study indicated that 55% of all Catholics had family ties to the Silhak school.

===Lay leadership===
As a result of the influence of the Silhak school, Catholicism in Korea began as an indigenous lay movement rather than being largely organized by a foreign missionaries. The first Catholic prayer-house was founded in 1784 at Seoul by Yi Seung-hun, a diplomat who had been baptized in Beijing. In 1786, Yi proceeded to establish a hierarchy of lay-priests. Although the Vatican ruled in 1789 that the appointment of lay-priests violated Canon law, in Korea indigenous lay-workers rather than foreign prelates carried Catholicism to many. Since Christianity began as largely a grassroots effort in Korea, it spread more quickly through the population.

===Hangul, literacy and education===
Hangul, a phonemic Korean alphabet invented around 1446 by scholars in the court of Sejong the Great, was little used for several centuries because of the perceived cultural superiority of Classical Chinese (a position similar to that of Latin in Europe). However, the Catholic Church became the first Korean religious organization to officially adopt Hangul as its primary script. Bishop Siméon-François Berneux (1814–1866) mandated that all Catholic children be taught to read it. Christian literature printed for use in Korea, including that used by the network of schools established by Christian missionaries, mostly used the Korean language and the easily learned Hangul script. This combination of factors resulted in a rise in the overall literacy rate, and enabled Christian teachings to spread beyond the elite, who mostly used Chinese. As early as the 1780s, portions of the Gospels were published in Hangul; doctrinal books such as the &quot;Jugyo Yoji&quot; (주교요지) appeared in the 1790s and a Catholic hymnal was printed around 1800.

John Ross, a Scottish Presbyterian missionary based in Shenyang, completed his translation of the New Testament into Korean in 1887, and Protestant leaders began a mass distribution effort. In addition, they established numerous schools, the first modern educational institutions in Korea. The Methodist Paichai School for boys was founded in 1885, and the Methodist Ewha School for girls (later to become Ewha Womans University) followed in 1886. These, and similar schools established soon afterward, helped the expansion of Protestantism among the common people. Protestants surpassed Catholics as the largest Christian group in Korea. Female literacy rose sharply, since women had previously been excluded from the educational system.

===Christianity under Japanese occupation, 1910–1945===
Christianity grew steadily, with the Catholic population reaching 147,000, and the Protestants 168,000 by the mid-1930s. The stronghold for both groups was the North. From 1910 to 1945 the Japanese occupied all of the country, taking over its rule under a treaty forced on Korea. The Japanese-controlled police made systematic efforts to minimize the influence of the missionaries; this reduced conversions during the years 1911–1919. The idealistic pronouncements of the U.S. President Woodrow Wilson about self-determination of nations contributed to the rapid growth of Korean nationalism in the 1920s, but disillusionment set in after the movement failed to achieve meaningful reform. In 1924, Protestants founded the Korean National Christian Council to coordinate activities and divided the country into regions assigned to specific Protestant denominations for oversight. Korean Protestants also founded overseas missions to Koreans in China.

By 1937, the Presbyterian Church of Korea was largely independent of financial support from the United States; in 1934 the Methodist Church became autonomous and elected a Korean bishop. The most active missionaries among the Catholics were the Maryknoll order, which opened the Maryknoll School of Nursing in Pusan in 1964; it is now the Catholic University of Pusan.

===Korean nationalism===

One of the most important factors leading to widespread acceptance of Christianity in Korea was the identification that many Christians forged with the cause of Korean nationalism during the Japanese occupation (1910–1945). During this period, Japan undertook a systematic campaign of cultural assimilation. There was an emphasis on Showa, so the Koreans would revere the Japanese emperor. In 1938, Japan prohibited the use of the Korean language in government, schools and businesses and even at home. The distinctly Korean nature of the church was reinforced during those years by the allegiance to the nation that was demonstrated by many Christians. While South Korea&#x27;s constitution guarantees freedom of religion and separation of church and state, the government has been sympathetic to Christianity. It considers the religion to provide some ideological protection against their Communist neighbor.

On 1 March 1919, an assembly of 33 religious and professional leaders, known as the &quot;March 1 Movement&quot;, passed a Declaration of independence. Although organized by leaders of the Chondogyo religion, 15 of the 33 signatories were Protestants, including figures such as Gil Seon-ju. The Japanese imprisoned many in the movement. Also in 1919, the predominantly Catholic pro-independence movement called &quot;Ulmindan&quot; was founded. A China-based Korean government-in-exile was at one time led by Syngman Rhee, a Methodist.

Christianity was linked even more with the patriotic cause when some Christians refused to participate in worship of the Japanese Emperor, which was required by law in the 1930s. Although this refusal was motivated by theological rather than political convictions, the consequent imprisonment of many Christians strongly identified their faith, in the eyes of many Koreans, with the cause of Korean nationalism and resistance to the Japanese occupation. Especially the independence of Korea and the Korean War periods featured a further increase in Marian devotion among many Catholics that because Catholics thought the Blessed Virgin Mary who is patron saint of Korea helped Koreans against Japanese imperialism and communism. Both the date of Liberation Day in 1945 and the date of the establishment of the South Korean government in 1948 also overlap with the feast day of the Assumption of Mary.

===Minjung theology===

The Christian concept of individual worth has found expression in a lengthy struggle for human rights and democracy in Korea. In recent years, this struggle has taken the form of Minjung theology. Minjung theology is based on the &quot;image of God&quot; concept expressed in Genesis 1:26–27, but also incorporates the traditional Korean feeling of &quot;han&quot;, a word that has no exact English translation, but that denotes a sense of inconsolable pain and utter helplessness. Minjung theology depicts commoners in Korean history as the rightful masters of their own destiny. Two of the country&#x27;s best known political leaders, Kim Young-sam, a Presbyterian, and Kim Dae-jung, a Roman Catholic, subscribe to Minjung theology. Both men spent decades opposing military governments in South Korea and were frequently imprisoned as a result, and both also served terms as President of the Republic after democracy was restored in 1988.

One manifestation of Minjung theology in the final years of the Park Chung Hee regime (1961–1979) was the rise of several Christian social missions, such as the Catholic Farmers Movement and the Protestant Urban Industrial Mission, which campaigned for better wages and working conditions for laborers. The military government imprisoned many of their leaders because it considered the movement a threat to social stability, and their struggle coincided with a period of unrest which culminated in the assassination of President Park on 26 October 1979.

===Social change===
Many Korean Christians believe that their values have had a positive effect on various social relationships. Traditional Korean society was hierarchically arranged according to Confucian principles. This structure was challenged by the Christian teaching that all human beings are created in the image of God and thus that every one of them is equal and has essential worth. According to Kim Han-sik, this concept also supported the idea of property being owned by individuals rather than by families.

Christians regarded the emperor as a mere man who was as much under God&#x27;s authority as were his subjects, and Christian values favored the social emancipation of women and children. Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required to educate them. Youn Chul-ho insisted that Korean churches could transform the world through the serving and sacrifice of the church.

Most Korean Christians from philosophers, preachers, to laity incorporate the values of Confucianism into their lives, including &quot;filial piety and loyalty&quot; to family members.

===Economic growth===
South Korea&#x27;s rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s is usually credited to the policy of export-oriented industrialization led by Park Chung Hee to indigenous cultural values and work ethic, a strong alliance with the United States, and the infusion of foreign capital. Many South Korean Christians view their religion as a factor in the country&#x27;s dramatic economic growth over the past three decades, believing that its success and prosperity are indications of God&#x27;s blessing.

A 2003 study by economists Robert J. Barro and Rachel McCleary suggests that societies with high levels of belief in heaven and high levels of church attendance exhibit high rates of economic growth. Barro and McCleary&#x27;s model has been influential in subsequent scholarship and, to some observers, it supports the belief that Christianity has played a major role in South Korea&#x27;s economic success. The study has been criticised by scholars such as Durlauf, Kortellos and Tan (2006). There is a tendency to build megachurches since 2000, that leads some churches to financial debt.

===World Mission and Evangelization===
&quot;In the 1960s the church reached out to people who were oppressed, such as prostitutes and new industrial laborers. As the Korean economy was burgeoning, the issue of the industrial labor force came to the fore as one of the most important areas of evangelization work. Churches established industrial chaplaincies among the workers within factories. In addition, with military service mandatory for men in South Korea, the part the chaplain&#x27;s corps in the armed forces became equally important. Many soldiers converted to Christianity during their military service.&quot;
Korean is now second only to the United States in terms of commissioned missionaries (30,000). The denomination with the highest number of missionaries is Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong) with about 3,000 missionaries.

==Political and social issues==
There have been various political and social criticisms in the Korean Christian scene since President Lee Myung-bak came into power. The South Korean government proposed to restrict South Korean citizens working for missionary works in the Middle East. Professor Son Bong-ho of Goshin University criticized the president for partaking in a national-level Christian prayers&#x27; gathering in March 2011 that signaled a potential danger of the strong Protestant influence in the secular South Korean politics. Increasing acts of hostility by Protestant Christians against Buddhism, have drawn strong criticism and backlash against Protestant churches by the South Korean public and has contributed in Protestantism&#x27;s growing decline in Korea.

===Seoul Free Lunch Referendum===
Former Mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, proposed a referendum in Seoul on 24 August 2011. Pastors of multiple churches in Seoul were found to involve unlawfully with the lay people about the referendum and later being penalized by the Seoul Metropolitan election Commission (서울시선거관리위원회).

===October 2011 by-election===
A Christian group in Seoul had been indicted by the Seoul Metropolitan election Commission for sending politically motivated emails to the laypeople in order to vote for the conservative candidate, Na Kyung-won, before the 2011 South Korean by-elections.

===Creationism===
In South Korea, Protestant groups have been involved in the promotion of creationism, especially the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) which advocates creation following the Book of Genesis, and the Society for Textbook Revise (STR), an alternative translation Committee to Revise Evolution in Textbook (CREIT). It&#x27;s an independent offshoot of the KACR, and has distanced itself from the KACR doctrine. In early 2008, Seoul Land, a leading amusement park, hosted a &quot;creation science&quot; exhibit, organized by KACR, which was visited by over 116,000 visitors in three months, and , the park is in talks to create a year-long exhibition.

In 2012, following pressure from STR, the Ministry of Education announced that many high-school textbooks would be revised to remove certain examples of evolution, such as of the horse and the dinosaur &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. The changes were limited to removal or revision of certain examples which were the subject of some debate; also, STR plans to submit further petitions to remove evolution of humans and the adaptation of finch beaks, with the end goal of diminishing the role of Darwinian evolution in teaching. This attempt was eventually denied by South Korean government in September of the year.

===Religious conflict===
Fundamentalist Protestant antagonism against Buddhism has been a major issue for religious cooperation in South Korea, especially during the 1990s to late 2000s. Acts of vandalism against Buddhist amenities and &quot;regular praying for the destruction of all Buddhist temples&quot; have drawn criticism. Buddhist statues have been considered as idols, attacked and decapitated. Arrests are hard to enforce, as the perpetrators work by stealth at night. Such acts, which are supported by some Protestant leaders, have led to South Koreans having an increasingly negative outlook on Protestantism and being critical of church groups involved, with many Protestants leaving their churches in recent years.

In contrast, relations between South Korean Catholics and Buddhists and other faiths has remained largely cooperative, partly due to the syncretism of many Buddhist and Confucian customs and philosophies into South Korean Catholicism, most notably the practice of &quot;jesa&quot;.

==Pope Francis&#x27; visit==

Pope Francis accepted an invitation to visit South Korea in August 2014. The four-day visit (14–18 August) culminated with a Papal Mass at Myeongdong Cathedral, the seat of the Archdiocese of Seoul on 18 August. During a Mass on 16 August, the Pope beatified 124 Korean Catholic martyrs. An invitation for North Korea&#x27;s Catholics to attend was declined, due to South Korea&#x27;s refusal to withdraw from military exercises which it had planned with the United States.

<text>Dave Pegg (born 2 November 1947) is an English multi-instrumentalist and record producer, primarily a bass guitarist. He is the longest-serving member of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and has been bassist with a number of folk and rock groups including the Ian Campbell Folk Group and Jethro Tull.

==History==

===Early career===
David Pegg was born on 2 November 1947, at Acocks Green, Birmingham, England. He began to learn guitar when 14 or 15, inspired by The Shadows, and played in a school band at Yardley Grammar School.

After leaving school he worked as an insurance clerk for about a year while playing in a part-time bands the Crawdaddys and The Roy Everett Blues Band, who supported several performers from the Birmingham beat scene of the time, including the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues. In 1966 he auditioned for The Uglys, featuring Steve Gibbons and was beaten to the position by friend and guitarist Roger Hill, but was offered the job of bass guitarist and switched instruments.

The Uglys cut one single before Pegg and Hill left to form a blues trio, The Exception, with singer Alan Eastwood. At this period he played with Robert Plant and in his next band, The Way of Life, the drummer was John Bonham, later both went to form Led Zeppelin. In 1967 he joined the Ian Campbell Folk Group, where he switched to stand-up bass, learnt to play the mandolin and acquired his affection for folk music. It was also where he came to the attention of local folk guitarist Ralph McTell and former Campbell Group and future Fairport Convention member Dave Swarbrick.

By early 1969 he had moved back to electric bass with The Beast, with Cozy Powell and Dave Clempson, before the latter left for Colosseum. Soon after this he joined the Birmingham band Dave Peace Quartet, and played bass on their electric blues album &quot;Good Morning Mr Blues&quot; released on SAGA FID 2155. One week after seeing Fairport for the first time on his twenty-first birthday he was called by Swarbrick to audition for the band after the departure of Ashley Hutchings, who was soon to found Steeleye Span.

===Fairport Convention 1969–1979===

Pegg joined Fairport Convention towards the end of 1969 and formed a strong playing partnership with drummer Dave Mattacks and good relationships with the other members. Although Hutchings had been a solid and melodic bass player, Pegg played with greater virtuosity, complexity and energy. Ashley Hutchings credits Pegg with being the musician who began the technique of playing jigs and reels on the bass, rather than just a supportive bass line, which was subsequently adopted by most British folk rock and even folk punk bassists. All this was obvious on the 1970 tour of Britain and America (including support for Jethro Tull), recordings from which surfaced on the &quot;Live at the L.A. Troubadour&quot; album (1977). His first album with the group, &quot;Full House&quot; (1970), showed more technically accomplished playing from the band, showing Pegg&#x27;s musical influence on the group.

On joining the band Pegg had moved his family from Birmingham and into the former pub, the Angel in Hadham, Hertfordshire along with other group members and their families. This became the theme for the title track of the next album &quot;Angel Delight&quot; (1971), for which Pegg received his first writing credit. On the next album &quot;Babbacombe Lee&quot;, a folk-rock opera masterminded by Swarbrick, he played a much greater role, contributing to seven of the fifteen tracks. The next album &quot;Rosie&quot; contained three of his contributions, including the song &quot;Peggy&#x27;s Pub&quot; a statement of a lifelong ambition.

In 1971 when Simon Nicol and Dave Mattacks left the band, Pegg and Swarbrick were the only remaining members and, as a succession of personnel came (or returned) and left again over the next five years, their partnership kept the band running. Some of these performers, like Sandy Denny and her husband Trevor Lucas, were acknowledged songwriters and as a result, although he still made contributions and took part in collaborations, Pegg&#x27;s song-writing took a back seat to his instrumental and organisational skills. After the financial disaster that followed the &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; (1975) tour, which prompted Denny, Lucas and Jerry Donahue to quit the band, Pegg became increasingly determined for the group to take control of their finances and direction and took over a larger responsibility. Pegg and Swarbrick renewed contact with Nicol in 1975 forming a low key trio, Three Desperate Mortgages, which toured student venues across Britain.

With only Pegg, Swarbrick and replacement drummer Bruce Rowland left, they persuaded Nicol to rejoin the band during the &quot;Gottle O&#x27;Geer&quot; album sessions. The remaining quartet signed up with Vertigo, and produced two albums, &quot;The Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; (1977) and &quot;Tipplers Tales&quot; (1978). Although well crafted these albums did not sell well and Vertigo bought them out of their contract. With Swarbrick suffering acute hearing problems and with no recording contract the group decided to disband and played a final concert at Cropredy in Oxfordshire on 4 August 1979, close to where Pegg lived.

While with Fairport, Pegg had played on a variety of albums for other performers. Among them were: Nick Drake&#x27;s &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; (1970); John Martyn&#x27;s &quot;Solid Air&quot; (1973) and &quot;One World&quot; (1977), as well as work for current and ex-Fairporters, including several albums for Dave Swarbrick, on Sandy Denny&#x27;s &quot;Like an Old Fashioned Waltz&quot; (1973) and &quot;Rendezvous&quot; (1977) and Richard Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Pour Down Like Silver&quot; (1975). He appeared on three Ralph McTell albums, including &quot;Streets&quot; (1973), and &quot;Slide Aside the Screen&quot; (1976), which Pegg also produced.

===Woodworm and Jethro Tull 1980–1995===
Although Fairport had disbanded they continued to play annual reunions at Cropredy, supplemented by New Year&#x27;s gigs in minor locations and occasional larger European festivals. Because no record label was interested in putting out recordings of the Cropredy concerts, Pegg and his wife Christine established their own label, Woodworm Records. They released the final concert as the album &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot; (1979) and subsequent recordings were issued as &#x27;official bootlegs&#x27;. He had already established a small recording studio in his house and with the money from the end of the record deal with Vertigo, he was able to develop this and it was eventually moved to a nearby converted chapel. The result was that Pegg had his own recording facility and record label. Artists like Steve Ashley began to record albums there from 1979. The Peggs established a mailing list of fans of the band, keeping interest in Fairport alive and, particularly Christine, took over the organization of the Cropredy Festival, which grew in size every year to reach about 18,000 attendees by the mid-1980s.

In 1979 Ian Anderson invited Pegg to stand in for the ailing John Glascock on the Jethro Tull &quot;Stormwatch&quot; tour. After Glascock&#x27;s death, Pegg was invited to join the band, still one of the biggest in the world, and it provided paid employment for Pegg for the next fifteen years. Pegg happened to join at a turning point for Jethro Tull. His first recording was intended as a solo album for Anderson, involving only Martin Barre from the band. The album, &quot;A&quot; (1980) was in stark contrast to the medieval and folk music inspired previous work, depending heavily on synthesizers for its sound. At this time all the other longstanding members left the band and the recording was put out as a Jethro Tull album. Pegg coped with this, and subsequent changes of style. The next album, &quot;Broadsword and the Beast&quot; (1982) had a heavier sound and more medieval theme and Pegg joined the band on stage in pseudo-medieval costume beside a Viking ship. In 1983 Pegg recorded his first solo album, &quot;The Cocktail Cowboy Goes It Alone&quot; (1983). After the next Tull album, &quot;Under Wraps&quot; (1984), Anderson&#x27;s vocal problems forced him to retire from touring for three years and Pegg had more time to pursue other projects.

===Reforming Fairport 1985–1995===
In 1981 Pegg joined Ralph McTell and ex-Fairport members Richard Thompson and Dave Mattacks in the GPs (an abbreviation for the &#x27;Grazed Pontiffs&#x27;, after a comment by Dave Mattacks following the attempted assassination of the Pope). The aim was for a pub band, playing a few originals and blues, rock n&#x27; roll, soul and country standards. They only gave six performances, including the Fairport reunion festival in 1981 (at Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire), which Woodworm Records released a recording of the performance as &quot;Saturday Rolling Around&quot; (1991). In the 1980s he also appeared on several recordings by other folk artists, including Murray Head and Dick Gaughan, besides those by Fairport and ex-Fairport members Simon Nicol and Richard Thompson.

In 1985 Pegg, Nicol and Mattacks were also free and the trio decided to make an album of new material for the band to play at the Cropredy Festival, using the Woodworm studio and label. The result was &quot;Gladys&#x27; Leap&quot; (1985), which was generally well received in the music and national press, but caused some tension with Swarbrick who refused to play any of the new material at the 1985 Cropredy Festival. Nevertheless, the decision to reform the band, without Swarbrick, was taken by the other three remaining members. Ric Sanders was invited to join, along with guitarist, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Maartin Allcock. Pegg was now in two major bands at the same time. The reformed Fairport produced an instrumental album &quot;Expletive Delighted&quot; (1986), mainly designed to showcase the virtuosity of Sanders and Allcock.

In 1987 Jethro Tull produced their first album for three years, &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;, to which Pegg contributed and this was to be followed by an American tour, on which Anderson invited Fairport to support Jethro Tull. Needing an album to promote, Pegg negotiated financial support from Island Records and Fairport put together &quot;In Real Time&quot; (1987). This was presented as a live album, but was actually a studio recording (albeit with all the songs recorded &quot;as live&quot; with all the musicians playing at the same time) with dubbed audience reactions. Although the tour was musically rewarding, it was unproductive financially and Pegg, being in both bands, left the stage with one band to return after a few minutes with the other, and the process was inevitably exhausting. Pegg played on three more Jethro Tull studio albums: &quot;Rock Island&quot; (1989), &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; (1991) and &quot;Roots to Branches&quot; (1995). In the same period he contributed to three studio albums by Fairport Convention: &quot;Red and Gold&quot; (1989) the &quot;Five Seasons&quot; (1990) and &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; (1995). Fairport&#x27;s popularity and the scale of their tours were growing throughout this period and the strain of undertaking two jobs, plus his other commitments, was becoming too much and he decided to leave Tull and focus on Fairport.

===Focusing on Fairport 1995–present===
 Part of the result of this change was a higher output of albums for Fairport Convention, with five studio albums from the acoustic &quot;Old New Borrowed Blue&quot; (1996) to &quot;Over the Next Hill&quot; (2004), beside four live albums and compilations. Pegg also released his second solo album &quot;Birthday Party&quot; (1998), which combined recordings from a celebratory concert for his fiftieth birthday at Dudley Town Hall with studio recordings.

In 1998, Pegg formed The Dylan Project, a Bob Dylan tribute band with Simon Nicol, PJ Wright, Steve Gibbons, and Gerry Conway. In 2006, Nicol was replaced by Birmingham keyboard player Phil Bond. They tour annually in the autumn and have produced two studio albums and a live album recorded at Cropredy Festival.

In 2002 Dave Pegg shared with other Fairport Convention members a &#x27;Lifetime Achievement Award&#x27; at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

In 2004 Pegg and his wife Christine divorced. The Woodworm studio was sold, and a new record label, Matty Grooves was established for the band and the group as a whole now organises the Cropredy Festival, now called Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention.

Pegg also formed Peggy &amp; PJ, a duo with guitarist PJ Wright, who had been lead guitar with the Steve Gibbons Band, touring smaller venues and producing an album &quot;Galileo&#x27;s Apology&quot; in 2007, a collection of pop and folk-rock songs and instrumentals. Pegg also had a second &#x27;birthday bash&#x27; at Birmingham Town Hall, released as &quot;Dave Pegg&#x27;s 60th Birthday Bash&quot; (2008).

In 2007 a retrospective of Pegg&#x27;s career was launched. &quot;A Box of Pegg&#x27;s&quot; contained four CDs, summarizing his work with Fairport Convention, Crawdaddy, Richard Thompson, Mike Heron, Steve Ashley, Jethro Tull, The Ian Campbell Folk Group and others.

From 2010 to 2013 he appeared in France with the Breton band Red Cardell.

Pegg lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire. He has a daughter, Stephanie, who works as a PR consultant; his son, Matt Pegg, is a bassist who has played with Procol Harum and Francis Dunnery and has also stood in for Pegg live with Jethro Tull when Pegg was committed to touring with Fairport Convention.

<text>Edwin Jobson (born 28 April 1955) is an English musician noted for his use of synthesizers. He has been a member of several progressive rock bands, including Curved Air, Roxy Music, U.K. and Jethro Tull. He was also part of Frank Zappa&#x27;s band in 1976–77. Aside from his keyboard work Jobson has also gained acclaim for his violin playing. He won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. In March 2019 Jobson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.

== Early years==
Jobson was born Edwin Jobson in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, England on 28 April 1955. He started to learn piano at age 7, and added violin when he was 8 - he received a Diploma of Distinction from the Royal Academy of Music at the same age, and was playing in an orchestra at 12. At 16 he applied to study at the Royal Academy, but was denied a place because of his age, so he joined local band Fat Grapple instead. When he was 17 in 1972, Fat Grapple supported Curved Air, and shortly afterwards Jobson replaced the departing Darryl Way on violin.

The group had some regional success with their 1973 release &quot;Air Cut&quot;. They toured in Europe, however they disbanded shortly thereafter. In 2009, previously recorded tapes were released as the &quot;Lovechild&quot; album, which included two of Jobson&#x27;s compositions.

== Roxy Music ==

While still in Curved Air, Jobson became acquainted with Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry as their sisters shared a room in college. Jobson contributed to Ferry&#x27;s solo album, &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;, then in 1973 Jobson replaced Brian Eno in Roxy Music, where he found himself playing three roles: Eno&#x27;s, Ferry&#x27;s (who had stepped up as a frontman after initially playing piano), and his own. Jobson stayed with the band for three studio albums and numerous tours before the band went on an extended hiatus in 1976.
He featured on the live &quot;Viva!&quot; album, and particularly on &quot;If There Is Something&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s, Jobson continued to perform on keyboards and violin for a variety of recording artists, including King Crimson, Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay, John Entwistle, Bill Bruford, and others.

== Frank Zappa&#x27;s band ==

While touring in late 1975, Roxy Music opened for Frank Zappa&#x27;s band in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was at this performance that Jobson and Zappa first met. After the Roxy tour ended, Jobson subsequently spent a week in early 1976 travelling with Zappa&#x27;s band in Canada, during which time Jobson and Zappa performed a varied repertoire in hotel rooms and backstage at concert venues. Jobson was eventually brought onstage with only minutes&#x27; notice to perform what was essentially an audition before thousands of Zappa fans. 

Once Roxy Music went on hiatus in 1976, Jobson became heavily sought after. He contemplated an offer to join Procol Harum, but ultimately decided to become a member of Frank Zappa&#x27;s band. Although Jobson appeared on the cover of the &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; (1976) album, he did not perform on any of the recorded tracks. In a 1995 interview with &quot;Art Rock Magazine&quot;, Jobson explained that Zappa always recorded everything himself and whoever was in the band at the time of its release made it onto the album cover: &quot;You may be in the group when it comes out, or maybe you left the band five years before the album comes out. That&#x27;s how he makes records&quot;. Jobson is featured prominently on the live album &quot;Zappa in New York&quot; released in 1978 but recorded in December 1976 at the Palladium. Other albums featuring recordings with Jobson are &quot;Studio Tan&quot;, &quot;Shut Up &#x27;n Play Yer Guitar&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 6&quot; and the posthumously released &quot;Läther&quot;, originally slated to be released in 1977. In 2009, Vaulternative Records, Zappa&#x27;s label, released the live album &quot;Philly &#x27;76&quot;, recorded at the Spectrum Theater in Philadelphia in October 1976, in which Jobson is featured extensively on keyboards and violin.

== UK ==

In 1977, Jobson co-founded the progressive rock supergroup U.K. Initially, the band included former King Crimson members Bill Bruford (drums) and John Wetton (bass and lead vocals), along with guitarist Allan Holdsworth. However, after their debut album &quot;UK&quot; (1978) and subsequent tour, Bruford and Holdsworth departed to pursue other musical directions.

Drummer Terry Bozzio, who knew Jobson from their time together in Zappa&#x27;s band, was available and thus enlisted to join UK. The trio released two additional albums, &quot;Danger Money&quot; (1979) and a live concert production &quot;Night After Night&quot; (1979), and embarked on a successful tour before UK disbanded in 1980.

== Jethro Tull: &quot;A&quot; Tour ==

Jobson was asked to participate on Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson&#x27;s solo endeavour, which was eventually released by Chrysalis Records in 1980 as a full-fledged Tull album, &quot;A&quot;. Jobson, credited as a &#x27;special guest&#x27;, performed on keyboards, electric violin, and was cited on liner notes as providing additional musical material. He remained with the band for their subsequent world tour in 1980–1981.

Jobson reunited twice with the band in the subsequent years. He played keyboards and violin on their only 1985 concert, in place of Jethro Tull&#x27;s then keyboard player Peter-John Vettese, at International Congress Centrum in Berlin, to celebrate Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s 300th birthday. Jobson was heavily featured on the band&#x27;s performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Double Violin Concerto&quot;. He has also appeared as a surprise guest for the band&#x27;s concert in East Rutherford, New Jersey in November 1989.

== Yes ==

Jobson was briefly a member of Yes in 1983 after the departure of keyboardist Tony Kaye. Jobson neither recorded nor performed live with Yes. His only official appearances with the band were in promotional photographs, and in the video for &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, but the video was released after Kaye had rejoined and Jobson had departed. This resulted in Jobson appearing (though edited out as much as possible) in the original version of the song&#x27;s video. Jobson has stated on his website that he was asked to replace Kaye, and was hesitant to do so until after hearing the band&#x27;s new release, and then rehearsing with the band in London. He returned to his home in the US as a full member of Yes, and set forth learning the band&#x27;s repertoire. However, several weeks later he received a call from the band&#x27;s management advising that Kaye was back in the group and the two would be sharing keyboard duties. Jobson declined, and left the band.

== Solo career ==
In 1983 Capitol Records/EMI released Jobson&#x27;s solo effort, &quot;The Green Album&quot;. Half of the original compositions were performed in a band-style format using session musicians on drums, bass, and guitars, while the other half are instrumentals performed by Jobson without accompaniment (save bass on one track). Vocals, keyboards, and electric violin were performed by Jobson.

Two years later, Jobson made a significant genre shift from progressive rock music to the stylings of new age with &quot;Theme of Secrets&quot;. This 1985 release by new-age record label Private Music, was recorded solely using Synclavier and samples. That same year he also composed and performed three piano compositions on the label&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Piano One&quot;.

== Scoring for film and television ==

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Jobson also built a successful career as a composer of TV and film soundtracks. He scored nearly 100 episodes of the TV series &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996–2001). He served as choral music arranger for two 2003 Walt Disney Pictures releases, &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; and &quot;Brother Bear&quot;.

Jobson also composed music for the world of advertising, most notably the Amtrak &quot;California Zephyr&quot; commercial that featured Richie Havens singing &quot;There&#x27;s Something About a Train That&#x27;s Magic&quot;. For his scoring and music direction on this effort, Jobson won the Clio Award for original music scoring in 1988. He continued to receive Clio Award accolades as either a winner or finalist for a number of years running.

== Globe Music Media Arts ==
In 2000, Jobson started his own label, Globe Music Media Arts, where he produced/distributed a variety of what he termed &quot;an amalgamation of other somewhat more cultured musical styles&quot;, most notably the Bulgarian Women Choir&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Voices of Life&quot;. In addition to production duties, he also contributed three new compositions (originally slated for the perpetually in-progress UK reunion project called &quot;Legacy&quot;), and playing violin on two of the new pieces. In 2010 he launched the Zealots Lounge, a subscription-based fan club offering free downloads, VIP concert tickets and private Zealots Lounge events around the world. Jobson has likened those who participate in this programme as &quot;modern-day patrons of the arts&quot;.

==UKZ==
In October 2007, Jobson announced the formation of a new band, UKZ, with Trey Gunn, Marco Minnemann, Alex Machacek, and Aaron Lippert. Their EP, &quot;Radiation&quot;, became available from the Globe Music online store in January 2009 and had its official release on Glo Digital in March 2009; a 7:48 video of the title track was released earlier, appearing on YouTube in January 2009. The band&#x27;s first live performance was held at Town Hall in New York City on 24 January 2009. A few months later in June, UKZ also performed four dates in Japan in the cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. Additionally, on 9 August 2009, Jobson did a one-off reunion gig with Curved Air in Chislehurst, Kent.

In November 2009 Jobson reunited with former Roxy Music and U.K. bandmate, John Wetton, for what was termed &quot;The 30th Anniversary of U.K.&quot;, with three performances in Poland (Kraków, Warsaw and Bydgoszcz).

== Return to live performance ==

The Creation of Peace Festival in Kazan, Tatarstan on 30 August 2008 saw Jobson&#x27;s return to the stage after more than two decades. He played violin on one song with the Patti Smith Group, one song with Fairport Convention, and two songs (&quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic, Part 2&quot;) with the Crimson ProjeKCt. In addition to joining this collection of musicians, Jobson also performed piano and violin solos at the B1 club in Moscow.

During 2009 Jobson also created an adjunct performing group, the &#x27;U-Z Project&#x27;, which featured a revolving line-up of guest musicians; these ensembles continue to perform at live concerts throughout North and Central America, Europe, and Japan. Participating musicians have included John Wetton, Alex Machacek, Marc Bonilla, and drummers Marco Minnemann, Mike Mangini, Virgil Donati, Gary Husband, and Simon Phillips.

In January 2010 Jobson was named to the technical advisory board of Austin, Texas based keyboard manufacturer, Infinite Response. He was involved in the development of the company&#x27;s VAX77 folding MIDI keyboard controller, which Jobson showcased at the January 2010 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California. Jobson&#x27;s U-Z Project headlined NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on 20 June 2010. A live CD compiled from various U-Z performances in 2009 was released as &quot;Ultimate Zero – The Best of the U-Z Project Live&quot; in Japan in November 2010.

In January 2011, Jobson gave a series of &quot;master classes&quot; in Japan, featuring performances of compositions throughout his career and lecture-style discussions of his music. In April of that year, a Jobson-Wetton &quot;U.K.&quot; reunion tour provided performances in Japan and the US, with Alex Machacek (guitar) and Marco Minnemann (drums) completing the four-piece line-up. Jobson headlined the 2011 Zappanale festival on 21 August in Bad Doberan, Germany, and played an earlier gig in Zoetermeer, Netherlands on 19 August, with a U-Z project line-up of Marc Bonilla (vocals/bass), Alex Machacek (guitar) and Marco Minnemann (drums).

In early 2012, Jobson confirmed that he re-formed the UK trio line-up — Jobson, John Wetton, and Terry Bozzio — for a one-off world tour, which took place from May–June 2012, with the trio playing dates in North America and Japan. However, Bozzio did not join the additional summer concert dates in Europe, where drummer Gary Husband assumed that role. Alex Machacek (guitar) was also added to the band line-up. Jobson, Wetton, Machacek, and Husband also headlined at NEARfest Apocalypse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the trio of Jobson, Wetton, and Bozzio extended its performances with a March 2013 stint on the inaugural voyage of the progressive rock Cruise to the Edge excursion, where they headlined with Yes and Steve Hackett.

Jobson marked the fortieth anniversary of the start of his professional music career with a short tour in Japan during November 2013. Joining him onstage was an ensemble cast of musicians from his career, including John Wetton, Sonja Kristina, Alex Machacek, Marco Minnemann, Aaron Lippert, and Ric Fierabracci. He performed songs which spanned the four decades including music from Curved Air, Roxy Music, U.K., UKZ, as well as his solo efforts, to sold-out venues in Tokyo and Osaka.

In April 2017 Jobson and Marc Bonilla began the &quot;Fallen Angels Tour&quot;, a tribute to the music of John Wetton &amp; Keith Emerson, commencing at London&#x27;s Under The Bridge venue at Stamford Bridge Stadium on 22 April.

== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ==

On the 29 of April 2019, in what he referred to as &quot;his final performance&quot;, Jobson reunited with Roxy Music at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York for the 2019 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Jobson performed three songs with the band, including &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, featuring his trademark Plexiglas violin used on the original violin solo. Jobson is the first and only violinist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<doc id="430059" wikidata="Q6984410" url="?curid=430059" title="Near v. Minnesota">
<text>Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court under which prior restraint on publication was found to violate freedom of the press as protected under the First Amendment. This principle was applied to free speech generally in subsequent jurisprudence. The Court ruled that a Minnesota law that targeted publishers of &quot;malicious&quot; or &quot;scandalous&quot; newspapers violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment). Legal scholar and columnist Anthony Lewis called &quot;Near&quot; the Court&#x27;s &quot;first great press case&quot;.

It was later a key precedent in &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot; (1971), in which the Court ruled against the Nixon administration&#x27;s attempt to enjoin publication of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;.

==Background of the case==

In 1927, Jay M. Near, who has been described as &quot;anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-black, and anti-labor&quot; began publishing &quot;The Saturday Press&quot; in Minneapolis with Howard A. Guilford, a former mayoral candidate who had been convicted of criminal libel.

The paper claimed that Jewish-American organized crime was &quot;practically ruling&quot; the city along with the police chief, Frank W. Brunskill, whom Near accused of corruption. Among the paper&#x27;s other targets were mayor George E. Leach, Hennepin County attorney and future three-term governor Floyd B. Olson, and the members of the grand jury of Hennepin County, who, the paper claimed, were either incompetent or willfully failing to investigate and prosecute known criminal activity.

Shortly after the first issue was distributed, Guilford was shot and hospitalized, where a further attempt on his life was made. At least one of the stories printed in &quot;The Saturday Press&quot; led to a successful prosecution of a gangster called Big Mose Barnett who had tried to extort protection money from a local dry cleaner by destroying his customers&#x27; clothing.

===First trial court proceeding===
Olson filed a complaint against Near and Guilford under the Public Nuisance Law of 1925. Also known as the &quot;Minnesota Gag Law&quot;, it provided permanent injunctions against those who created a &quot;public nuisance,&quot; by publishing, selling, or distributing a &quot;malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper.&quot; Olson claimed that the allegations raised against him and the other named public officials in all nine issues published between September 24, 1927, and November 19, 1927, as well as the paper&#x27;s overall anti-Semitic tone, constituted a violation of this law. On November 22, 1927, Judge Matthias Baldwing of the Hennepin County District Court issued a temporary injunction that barred the defendants from editing, publishing, or circulating &quot;The Saturday Press&quot; or any other publication containing similar material. This injunction was granted without notice to either defendant on an &quot;ex parte&quot; hearing between Olson and the judge, and was to extend until the hearing on the judge&#x27;s order for the defendants to show cause as to why they should not be permanently enjoined from publishing their paper. The hearing was held December 9, and future Minneapolis mayor Thomas E. Latimer argued that the defendants&#x27; activities were protected by the U.S. and Minnesota constitutions and demurred to the complaint.

Judge Baldwin denied the demurrer and was affirmed by the Minnesota Supreme Court on appeal.

===First Minnesota Supreme Court decision===
The State Supreme Court wrote that a scandalous publication &quot;annoys, injures and endangers the comfort and repose of a considerable number of persons,&quot; and so constituted a nuisance just as surely as &quot;places where intoxicating liquor is illegally sold,&quot; &quot;houses of prostitution,&quot; &quot;dogs,&quot; &quot;malicious fences&quot; &quot;itinerant carnivals,&quot; &quot;lotteries,&quot; and &quot;noxious weeds.&quot; The court considered that a newspaper may also endanger safety, because &quot;scandalous material&quot; tended to disturb the peace and provoke assaults. The court cited previous Minnesota decisions that upheld the right of the state to enjoin the publication of &quot;details of execution of criminals&quot; and the teaching of &quot;things injurious to society.&quot; Restricting the publication of a newspaper based on its harmful content accordingly fell within the legitimate power of &quot;the people speaking through their representatives&quot; to preserve &quot;public morals&quot; and the &quot;public welfare.&quot; The court stated that it had to give heavy deference to such decisions, because &quot;it is the prerogative of the legislature to determine not only what the public interests require but also the measures necessary to protect such interests.&quot;

Regarding Near and Guilford&#x27;s defense of freedom of the press under article 1, section 3 of the Minnesota Constitution, the State Supreme Court did not believe that the right was intended to protect the publishing of &quot;scandalous material&quot;, but that it only provided &quot;a shield for the honest, careful and conscientious press,&quot; not the &quot;defamer and the scandalmonger.&quot; Instead, &quot;he who uses the press is responsible for its abuse.&quot; The court also ruled that the state constitution&#x27;s due process clause did not extend any additional protection.

===The trial court&#x27;s decision after remand===
The case then returned to the Hennepin County District Court, and Near and Guilford renewed their objection to the constitutionality of the Public Nuisance Law. Judge Baldwin again overruled their objection. Only the verified complaint that Olson had filed and the newspaper issues themselves were entered as evidence, and the defendants did not try to argue that the &quot;Saturday Press&quot; did not fit the definition under the statute, or that their published stories were in fact true. Baldwin ruled that the newspapers contained nothing but scandalous and defamatory material, and permanently enjoined the defendants &quot;from producing, editing, publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or giving away any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or defamatory newspaper, as defined by law,&quot; and also &quot;from further conducting said nuisance under the name and title of said &quot;The Saturday Press&quot; or any other name or title.&quot;
===Second Minnesota Supreme Court decision===

On appeal once again, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that its first decision left little question as to the constitutionality of the statute, both under the defendants&#x27; state constitutional challenge and a new argument based on due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The defendants also argued that the trial court&#x27;s injunction went too far because it effectively prevented them from operating &quot;any&quot; newspaper, but their appeal did not request a modification of the order. The court in any case disagreed with their interpretation of the order&#x27;s scope, stating that it did allow them to publish a newspaper, so long as it was operated &quot;in harmony with the public welfare.&quot;

Only Near appealed from this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, thanks to last-minute financial help from Col. Robert R. McCormick, the publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. A quotation from the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision written by Hughes is engraved in the lobby of the &quot;Tribune&quot; today.

==The Court&#x27;s decision==
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, reversed the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court and ruled that the Public Nuisance Law of 1925 was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court held that, except in rare cases, censorship is unconstitutional. The Court held:
Note that the paragraph above cites the Fourteenth Amendment and not the First Amendment. This is because the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the First and makes it applicable to the States. As literally written, the First Amendment applies to Congress and the federal government, not the states.

This case strengthened the notion that a prior restraint of the press violates the First Amendment. However, it left a loophole which would be used later for other prior restraint cases, citing certain circumstances in which prior restraint &quot;could&quot; potentially be used:
Hughes (Ct):
==Subsequent developments==
Near returned to publishing &quot;The Saturday Press&quot;, calling it &quot;the paper that refused to stay gagged&quot;. Guilford later joined the staff of the &quot;Twin City Reporter&quot;. He continued to draw the ire of organized crime in Minneapolis and was shot and killed on September 6, 1934.

The Court closed off one of the few outlets remaining to censor the press under &quot;Near&quot; in &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; (1964), which seriously limited the grounds upon which a public official could sue for libel. Statements made regarding their official conduct were only actionable if made with &quot;actual malice&quot;, meaning a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth.

&quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot; (1988) excluded parodies from even this limited standard, as they included no actionable statements of fact. &quot;Hustler&quot; made clear this protection extended beyond merely defamation suits to cover other torts such as intentional infliction of emotional distress.

==Basic case law resulting from this case==
No prior restraint of the content of news by the government is allowed unless it reveals crucial military information, contains obscenity, or may directly incite &quot;acts of violence&quot;.

<doc id="430062" wikidata="Q188938" url="?curid=430062" title="Djerba">
<text>Djerba (; , ; ), also transliterated as Jerba or Jarbah, is a Tunisian island and the largest island of North Africa at , in the Gulf of Gabès, off the coast of Tunisia. Administratively, it is part of Medenine Governorate. The island had a population of 139,544 at the 2004 census, which rose to 163,726 at the 2014 census. Citing its long and unique history, Tunisia has sought UNESCO World Heritage status protections for the island, and, in 2023, Djerba was officially designated a World Heritage Site.

== History ==
Djerba is speculated to have been the island of the lotus-eaters where Odysseus was stranded on his voyage through the Mediterranean Sea. Djerba was known as the island of Lytos in the time of the Greeks. It was possible to locate one of its villages from the Qantara Tower, and the name Djerba was given to the area near Houmt Souk. 

=== Antiquity ===
The Berbers are indigenous to the Maghreb. They inhabited the coasts and mountains and worked in cultivating the land. Their homes are caves and houses carved or built from stones and mud, or straw and tree branches in the form of huts on top of the mountains and plateaus. Others lived a nomadic lifestyle, traveling with their livestock, and they lived under tents. Some sects of them lived by the means of plundering. Others still lived in populous cities that they built, as proven by Ibn Khaldun and others. Ibn Khaldun says in the history of Ibn Khaldun, Part One. - 8 of 258:

Their clothing consists of striped woolen fabric and a black robe. They wear a cordon and a robe. They shave their heads and do not cover them with anything, and they cover their faces with a sham, which is still in practice today. They eat koski, speak and write Challah, and some people, especially in southern Tunisia, such as the mountains of Matmata and Doueirat, still use this language when communicating: it is a distinct language in itself, known from ancient times and frequent until now, and it has its own popular oral literature.

Djerba was settled by different people in antiquity, first by the Greek and later by the Phoenicians in the 12th century BC. who came from Tyre and Sidon. During this period, trade flourished in Djerba, thus spreading the pottery industry and the manufacture of purple dye, which historians mentioned was comparable to, if not superior to, the purple of Tyre, and was sold at the highest prices. It seems clear that the Phoenicians were the ones who introduced the planting of olive trees, thus spreading the industry of olive pressing.

After the Phoenicians came the Romans, and the island witnessed great prosperity during the Roman era, the urban effects of which still indicate it today. In the fifth century, the Vandals, a Germanic tribe who had emigrated to the Maghreb in 429 AD, conquered the island under the leadership of its king, Gaiseric.

=== Middle Ages ===
==== Islamic conquest ====
During the Early Muslim conquests by the Arabs, Djerba was among the places included in the Arab conquest at the hands of Ruwayfi ibn Thabit al-Ansari in the year 665 during the invasion of Tunisia by Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Hudaij, in which the Ibadi sect prevailed.

Then it became &quot;Afriqiya&quot; after its conquest under the rule of the governors, and their reign lasted for nearly a century from 716 to 800. The state went through several disturbances until the Aghlabid state, which was in dispute with the Rustumid state in Algeria. Djerba was sometimes subordinate to the Aghlabids and sometimes to the Rustamids, but it was always semi-independent, until the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate, which controlled the area from 909 to 972. The island then became part of the possession of emir Bulukīn ibn Zīrī al-Sanhaji, whom al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah al-Fatimi appointed as ruler of Afriqiya after the Fatimids moved their capital to Cairo.

The Sanhaji state went through two successive stages: an era of prosperity and an era of turmoil. In the first stage, Kairouan experienced prosperity for 78 years until the arrival of the Hilalids in the year 1049. As for the second stage, Djerba suffered many calamities due to the invasions it was exposed to. Perhaps the most prominent of these was when “Rogar al-Narmandi”, conquered the stronghold in 1135 in response to repeated piracy in the Mediterranean. After its subjugation, the town&#x27;s women and children were sent to Sicily, despite the violent resistance shown by the pirate lords and local folk. Djerba remained under Norman occupation from 1135 to 1159. Over two decades later however, while the Normans and their ruler William I, were primarily focused on their massive invasion of the Byzantine Empire in 1185, the Almohad Caliphate, with its origins in the sandy deserts of Morocco, &quot;woke up from its slumber and remembered that its enemy was sitting on a cherished piece of its soil. It prepared a large army in a huge fleet, forced the Frankish garrison to withdraw, and the island entered the rule of the Almohads.&quot; The control of the island later passed down to the Berber Hafsid dynasty by early 13th century.

==== From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century ====
The Ottomans entered a part of Africa in 1574 and made it an Ottoman province, similar to what they did in the Central Maghreb in 1519-1520 and in Tripoli in 1551. However, this Tunisian province, which was formed at a later date, soon developed its political system before its Algerian and Tripolitan neighbors since the late 16th century. At that time, the rule of the Dey with sole authority appeared (in the first half of the 17th century), then a semi-monarchical hereditary system during the era of the Muradid Beys (1628-1702) and then the Husseinis (after 1705). These Husseinis succeeded in building the edifice of a state firmly established in the country and enjoying broad independence from external powers (Istanbul or the Dey of Algiers), especially during the reign of Hammuda Pasha (1782-1814).

The two giant empires - the Ottoman and the Spanish - took advantage of the weakness of the Hafsid state to intervene in Tunisia from 1534-1535. In addition to the island of Djerba, Darguth Pasha was able to occupy Gafsa in 1556 and Kairouan (the capital of the Almoravid Emirate of Chabia) in 1557, and the Bayler Bey (Supreme Commander) “Ali Pasha” or “Alaj Ali” entered the city of Tunis. In 1569, before the Spanish evacuated him from it in 1573.

The Ottoman Sultan Selim II decided to eradicate the Spaniards from Tunisia for strategic reasons (monitoring the southern bank of the Strait of Sicily), political reasons (completed the occupation of the countries of this bank from Egypt to the borders of the Far Maghreb), and religious reasons (jihad was one of the constants of Ottoman policy). With the help of the people, the Ottomans were able to storm the huge fortress of La Goulette, then seize Tunis and completely eliminate the Spanish presence during the summer of 1574.

The modern era opened with a deep crisis in all Maghrebian countries, including Tunisia, which ended with the Ottomans’ accession there and its transformation into an Ottoman province.

However, its political system quickly developed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries into an independent “semi-national monarchy” with only formal ties of loyalty to Istanbul. They control (varyingly according to the regions and groups) a specific space that is different from the space of the neighbouring provinces.

Then Tunisia fell into the trap of colonialism, as German Chancellor Bismarck declared to the French ambassador in Berlin (January 4, 1879): “The Tunisian pear has ripened and it is time for you to pick it...” Indeed, since the first third of the nineteenth century, the conditions of the Tunisian province have gradually deteriorated and worsened under the pressure of the rising European expansionist powers, until the province stabilized in a comprehensive crisis that facilitated the French intervention in 1881.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the island witnessed radical transformations, and perhaps the most prominent thing that distinguishes this era is the migration of its people to engage in trade in some Islamic cities and Tunisian cities. During the period of French rule, the people of the island had an effective contribution to the Tunisian national movement. Following independence, Djerba became one of the most prominent Tunisian tourist attractions and a destination for tourists from all over the world.

=== Since 1881 ===
The island was subjected to attacks by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. It was also damaged as a result of Yunus Bey’s invasion of it in the year 1738 AD, and it was damaged by the epidemics of 1705 and 1706, 1809, 1864, and its economy was greatly damaged, then it suffered under the yoke of French colonialism in 1881 AD, until it gained its independence in 1956 AD.

==== Demands to become a “Tunisian Governorate” ====
The island of Djerba is administratively affiliated with the governorate of Medenine, but some people on the island have been demanding since the January 2011 revolution for secession from the governorate of Medenine and for Djerba to become the twenty-fifth Tunisian governorate, which did not resonate with Tunisian officials.

=== Jewish history ===
According to their oral history, the Jewish minority has dwelled on the island continuously for more than 2,500 years, following the destrucrion of the Temple of Jerusalem . The first physical evidence that historians know of comes from the 11th century found in Cairo Geniza. The descendants of this community still live in Houmt Souk.

This community is unique in the Jewish diaspora for its unusually high percentage of Kohenim, direct patrilineal descendants of Aaron, the first high priest from Mosaic times. Local tradition holds that when Nebuchadnezzar II levelled Solomon&#x27;s temple and laid waste to Judah and the city of Jerusalem in the year 586 BC, the Kohenim who settled in Djerba were among the refugees who were able to avoid slavery.

A key point in this oral history has been backed up by genetic tests for Cohen modal haplotype showing that the vast majority of male Jews on Djerba claiming the family status of Cohen had a common ancient male ancestor which matches that of nearly all of both historically European and Middle Eastern Jewish males with a family history of patrilineal membership in the Jewish priestly caste. Thus, the island has been known by many Jews as the island of the Kohenim. According to the legend, during the destruction of the temple, the Kohenim, who were serving the temple at the time of destruction escaped from Jerusalem and found themselves on the island of Djerba. The legend claims the Kohenim carried the door and some stones from the Temple in Jerusalem which they then incorporated into the &quot;marvelous synagogue&quot;, also known as Ghriba, which still stands in Djerba.

The Jewish community differs from others in Djerba in their dress, personal names and accents. The Jewish rabbinate of Djerba have established an eruv, which establishes the communal area in the city in which Jews can freely carry objects between their homes and community buildings on Shabbat. Some traditions that are distinctive of the Jewish Djerba community is the kiddush prayer said on the eve of Passover and a few prophetic passages on certain Shabbats of the year.

One of the community&#x27;s synagogues, the El Ghriba synagogue, has been in continuous use for over 2,000 years. The Jews were settled in two main communities: the Hara Kabira (&quot;the big quarter&quot;;Arabic:&quot;الحاره الكبيرة&quot;) and the Hara Saghira (&quot;the small quarter&quot;;Arabic:&quot; الحاره الصّغيرة&quot;). The Hara Saghira identified itself with Israel, while the Hara Kabira identified with Spain and Morocco.

The next influx of Jewish people to the Island of Djerba occurred during the Spanish Inquisition, when the Iberian Jewish population was expelled. The Jewish population hit its peak during the time that Tunisia was fighting for independence from France 1881–1956. In 1940, there were approximately 100,000 Jewish-Tunisians or 15% of the entire population of Tunisia.

In the aftermath of World War II, the Jewish population on the island declined significantly due to emigration to Israel and France. , the Jewish permanent resident community on the island numbered about 1,000, but many return annually on pilgrimage. However, once the State of Israel was established, and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa was building up many Jewish people were expelled from Tunisia. Although the Jewish community of Tunisia was on the decline, the Jewish community of Hara Kebira witnessed an increase of population due to its traditional character. The community on Djerba remains one of the last remaining fully intact Jewish communities in an Arab majority country. The most traditionally observant Jewish community is growing because of large natural families despite emigration and a new Orthodox Jewish school for girls has recently been inaugurated on the Island to serve alongside the two boys yeshiva schools. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; &quot;Relations between Jews and Muslims are complex—proper and respectful, though not especially close. Jewish men work alongside Arab merchants in the souk, for example, and enjoy amicable ties with Muslim customers.&quot;

The historical conflicts between Muslims and Jewish people have been largely absent in Djerba. This is reportedly attributed due to all the people of the island being at some point Jewish, and therefore share similar practices in their ways of life. Some of these Jewish practices that can be seen in Muslim households in Djerba are the lighting of candles on Friday night, and the suspending of matzot on the ceiling from one spring to the next. The Jewish and Muslim communities have coexisted peacefully in Djerba despite political unrest regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The people of Djerba say that the two communities simply pray in different places, but are still able to converse. A Jewish leader once stated &quot;We live together, We visit our friends on their religious holidays. We work together. Muslims buy meat from our butchers. When we are forbidden to work or cook on the Shabbat, we buy bread and kosher food cooking by Muslims. Our children play together&quot;.

On 11 April 2002, Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for a truck bomb attack close to the famous synagogue, killing 21 people (14 German tourists, 5 Tunisians and 2 French nationals).

Since the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;, the Tunisian government has extended its protection and encouraged Jewish life on the island of Djerba. Citing the long and unique Jewish history on Djerba, Tunisia has sought UNESCO World Heritage status for the island. There are currently 14 synagogues, 2 yeshivot and 3 kosher restaurants.

A Jewish school on the island was firebombed during the national protests held in 2018, while security forces in Djerba were reduced, being preoccupied with protection efforts elsewhere. This attack was among many other uprisings that were occurring throughout Tunisia at the time.

On 9 May 2023, El Ghriba Synagogue was the target of a mass shooting on a large gathering of Jewish pilgrims that takes place every year at the synagogue. Five people were killed including: two Jewish cousins, a Jewish-French tourist, and two Tunisian security guards.

=== Ecclesiastical history ===

The city Girba in the Roman province of Tripolitania (mostly in modern Libya), which gave its name to the island, was important enough to become a suffragan bishop of its capital&#x27;s archbishopric. Known Bishops of antiquity include:
* Proculus (Maximus Bishop fl.393)
* Quodvultdeus (Catholic Bishop fl.401–411) attending Council of Carthage (411) 
* Euasius (Donatist Bishop fl.411) rival at Council of Carthage
* Urbanus (Catholic bishop fl.445–454)
* Faustinus (Catholic bishop fl. 484), exiled by King Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom
* Vincentius (Catholic bishop fl. 523–525)

The 1909 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; lists only two: &quot;At least two bishops of Girba are known, Monnulus and Vincent, who assisted at the Councils, of Carthage in 255 and 525&quot;.

== Climate ==
Djerba has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BWh&quot;) that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;).

==Migratory bird sanctuary==
Djerba Bin El Ouedian is a wetland and habitat for migratory birds. It is located at 33 ° 40 &#x27;N, 10 ° 55 &#x27;E. On 7 November 2007 the wetland was included on the list of Ramsar sites under the Ramsar Convention, due to its importance as a bird refuge.

<text>The Charter of Liberties, also called the Coronation Charter, or Statutes of the Realm, was a written proclamation by Henry I of England, issued upon his accession to the throne in 1100. It sought to bind the King to certain laws regarding the treatment of nobles, church officials, and individuals. The nineteenth-century historians Frederick Maitland and Frederick Pollock considered it a landmark document in English legal history and a forerunner of Magna Carta.

The document addressed abuses of royal power by his predecessor William II (his brother William Rufus), as perceived by the nobility, specifically the over-taxation of the barons, the abuse of vacant sees, and the practices of simony and pluralism.

The Charter of Liberties was generally ignored by monarchs, until in 1213 Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, reminded the nobles that their liberties had been guaranteed over a century prior in Henry I&#x27;s Charter of Liberties.

==Background==

Henry I of England, nicknamed Beauclerc, was the fourth and youngest son of William I (William the Conqueror) by his queen Matilda of Flanders. The name Beauclerc was given because Henry was well educated, being able to read and write Latin, and possessed a knowledge of English law and natural history. He had received 5,000 pounds of silver from his father, but no land holdings. He used this to purchase a district in the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy for 3,000 pounds from his brother Robert of Normandy. Robert had been left the Duchy of Normandy by their father, but needed money. Various political intrigues occurred in France, which led to the imprisonment of Henry for two years by his brother William II, then King of England. In 1096, Robert left Normandy for the First Crusade. Henry swore fealty to William, who took over Normandy in Robert&#x27;s absence. William was killed in a hunting accident on 2 August 1100. (Henry was present on this hunting trip.) With William dead and Robert absent, Henry claimed the English crown.

Henry was immediately faced with three political problems. (1) The earls and barons did not accept him. (2) There was antagonism from the Church, especially Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury. (3) The native Anglo-Saxon population was not receptive to the new king.

Henry made concessions to the Church and reconciled with Anselm. He married Edith, the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, who was of mixed Anglo-Scots heritage, and so garnered great favour with the Anglo-Saxons. She changed her name to the Norman Mathilda. However, the choice displeased the barons and earls. Henry needed to mollify the nobles and secure his throne.

William II had issued a charter in 1093, when he was ill and fearing death. The text of this charter has been lost to history. It is believed to have freed prisoners, forgiven debts, and assured that holy and good laws would be maintained. Whatever promises William made, he quickly broke after he recovered his health.

Henry went further. He negotiated with the leading barons and earls, making various concessions to them. When all sides were agreed, the agreement was issued as the Charter of Liberties.

==Summary ==

After a traditional greeting, the Charter of Liberties contained fourteen declarations, summarised as follows:

Henry, king of the English, to Bishop Samson and Urso de Abetot and all his barons and faithful, both French and English, of Worcestershire, [copies were sent to all the shires] greeting.

==Aftermath==
William I had been a great admirer of the laws of Edward the Confessor. He had reformed many laws in an effort to make the law of Edward the common law of England while establishing a strong Norman rule and custom. During the entire Norman period, there was little legislation.

Henry began his reign with the Charter of Liberties, sending a strong message: he was returning to his father&#x27;s ways, which were viewed with great nostalgia. The perceived abuses of William II were to be abolished. The corruption and larceny of reliefs, wardships, marriages, murder fines and so forth, was to end. Debts and past offences were to be forgiven. The demesne lands and military tenants were to be freed from the danegeld of Danelaw. Above all, the “laga Eadwardii” Law of Edward the Confessor, as amended by William I, would be restored. The proclamation was made with the assumption that the barons would make the same concessions to their tenants as the king had promised to them. Plucknett is of the opinion that this good will probably did flow down the feudal chain. The Charter was not legislation, but rather a promise to return to the law, as it existed in the time of William I, before it had been corrupted by William II.

The promises made in the Charter could not be enforced. There is ample evidence that Henry I ignored them. The Pipe Rolls which came thirty-one years into Henry&#x27;s reign indicate he had extended the power of the crown well beyond the limits set in the Charter. The establishment of the Exchequer, ostensibly to end corruption and fraud in the taking and holding of taxes, in reality, led to greater power of the crown. The direction of its chief minister, Bishop Roger of Salisbury, evolved the law for tenants in chief which became the harshest and most severe in Europe. This occurred silently, and placed precedent upon precedent. Early in his reign, Henry issued a writ declaring the county and hundred courts should be held as in the days of Edward the Confessor. These had the result of bringing the ancient traditional tribunals in accordance with newer Norman methods. Chroniclers of the age state that Henry legislated about theft, restored capital punishment (which had been suspended for a great many crimes by William II), and harshly treated utterers of bad money and rapacious exactions of his courtiers. He made his roving court and army the terror of every neighborhood. Henry made the measure of his own arm the standard ell.

The drowning of his son, William, in the loss of the &quot;White Ship&quot; in 1120, led to the end of the Norman dynasty. Stephen of England claimed the throne in 1135. He was the last Norman king. His conflict with Henry&#x27;s daughter Matilda led to The Anarchy.
Plucknett describes the Charter of Liberties as a forerunner to legislation in later years. There was no legislation as such either under the Saxons or the Normans. The Charter was a great concession, born of political need. Large portions of the charter were a withdrawal of practices which were of questionable legality, and corrosive politically. Various feudal dues, instead of being arbitrary and &quot;ad hoc&quot;, were declared to be reduced to &quot;reasonable&quot; limits. The Charter led to an obscure decree of Stephen (1135–1154), the statutum decretum that established where there was no son, daughters would inherit. This was remarkable in its day, and pre-dated the reforms of Henry II of England.

The problems with the Church had been brewing for some time. William I had tried to invest bishops with his temporal seal. Pope Gregory VII in 1075 had prohibited lay investiture, holding the Church was independent of the state. A long struggle ensued. This was still going on when Henry I assumed the throne and entered into open conflict with Anselm. This conflict was moderated and ameliorated by the canon lawyer Ivo of Chartres. It was agreed that Henry could observe the selection of bishops, without interference. This accord was extended to all of Europe by 1122. The Concordat of Worms in 1122 did not last, but only changed the nature of tension between Church and State. The government of Henry I at Westminster became exquisitely effective. The mechanism of Norman government needed a strong hand. Stephen was not up to it. Henry&#x27;s death was viewed as a great tragedy for several centuries:

During the reign of Stephen, Henry I came to be known as the &quot;Lion of Justice&quot;.

The Charter of Liberties was a precedent for Magna Carta (Great Charter) of 1215, at the end of the reign of John of England.

<text>The Cayley–Galt Tariff of 1858 was the first protective tariff in the history of Canada. It imposed duties on fully-manufactured goods of 20% and a duty of 10% on partially-manufactured goods in an attempt to spur the domestic manufacturing industries.

The tariff caused immediate resentment in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The Americans&#x27; anger played an important role in their 1866 repeal of the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty, which had led to free trade in natural resources.

The tariff was only a foretaste of the much broader system of protection, which would be set up by the National Policy in 1879.

<doc id="430071" wikidata="Q1206759" url="?curid=430071" title="Valve stem">
<text>A valve stem is a self-contained valve that opens to admit gas to a chamber (such as air to inflate a tire), and is then automatically closed and kept sealed by the pressure in the chamber, or a spring, or both, to prevent the gas from escaping.

There are many types of valves, and they are most commonly used on automobile, motorcycle, and bicycle tires, but also for many other applications. The most common type is the Schrader valve, but some road bicycles with skinny tires instead use the Presta valve.

==Schrader==

Schrader valves consist of a valve stem into which a poppet valve is threaded with a spring attached. They are used on virtually all automobile and motorbike tires and on wider-rimmed bicycle tires. In addition to tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, plumbing, engine fuel injection, suspension systems, and SCUBA regulators, allowing the user to remove and attach a hose while in use. The Schrader valves in the fuel injector rail of many automobiles are used as a quick and easy point to check fuel pressure or connect an injector cleaner cartridge.

==Presta==

Presta valves (also called Sclaverand valves or French valves) are normally only used on bicycles. The stem has a narrower diameter (nominally 6 mm) than the thinnest (nominally 8 mm) Schrader type, and so the bore of the hole in the rim through which the stem passes can be smaller.
Has a locknut that needs to be opened to inflate/deflate.

==Dunlop (or Woods)==

Dunlop valves (also called Woods valves or English valves) were the dominating bicycle valves in the European region and many other countries.
As of 2021, Presta valves are just as common in these regions. Dunlop valves are still widely used especially on low to medium-priced bicycles (city and trekking bikes).
They can be pumped up with a Presta bicycle pump.

==Regina==

The &quot;Regina Valve&quot; is very similar to the Presta and mostly used in Italy. The central threaded pin is so short that it does not protrude from the valve tube and therefore cannot be bent. In order to close the valve tightly, a small, loose nut is placed on this threaded rod with a diameter of only around 1.5 mm and screwed on by hand. A threaded rod is enough. By tightening the nut, the valve disc with the conical sealing body is pressed against the valve seat. 

Rim drilling:⌀ 6.5 mm

Thread DIN 7756
• outside VG 6×32
•outside VG 5.2×24 at the upper end

Maximum pressure 15 bars.

==Others==

Many other valves are used only in certain regions or for limited purposes.

Invisible tire valves are different in design from traditional tire valves. An inflator stem is not used; instead, a removable cap on a valve stem embedded in the tire rim is fitted, with only the cap visible. When inflating the tire, the cap is first removed, typically with a coin, and then a &quot;portable&quot; dedicated inflator stem is screwed onto the valve stem. Through the inflator, the tire is inflated as usual.

<doc id="430072" wikidata="Q275059" url="?curid=430072" title="Foreigner (band)">
<text>Foreigner is a British-American rock band formed in New York City in 1976 by guitarist Mick Jones, vocalist Lou Gramm, drummer Dennis Elliott, keyboardist Al Greenwood, bassist Ed Gagliardi, and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald, the last of whom was also a founding member of King Crimson. Foreigner is one of the world&#x27;s best-selling bands of all time, with worldwide sales exceeding 80 million records, including 37.5 million in the United States.

Jones came up with the band&#x27;s name because he, Elliott, and McDonald were British, while Gramm, Greenwood, and Gagliardi were American, meaning at least half of the band members would be considered foreigners regardless of the country they were in. 

In 1977, Foreigner released its self-titled debut album, the first of six consecutive albums (including the 7× platinum 1982 greatest hits album &quot;Records&quot;) to be certified multi-platinum and reach the Top 10 in the US. The album produced two US Top 10 singles, &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot; and &quot;Cold as Ice&quot;. Their 1978 follow-up, &quot;Double Vision&quot;, was even more successful and included two more US hits: &quot;Hot Blooded&quot; and the title track. 

Rick Wills replaced Gagliardi on bass before Foreigner recorded their third album, &quot;Head Games&quot; (1979), which featured the US Top 20 singles &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot; and the title track. After the departures of McDonald and Greenwood, reducing the band to a quartet, their next album, &quot;4&quot; (1981), hit No. 1 for 10 weeks in the US and became Foreigner&#x27;s breakthrough album in the UK, where it reached the Top 5. The album produced three hit singles: &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;, and &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;. 

In 1984, Foreigner released their fifth studio album, &quot;Agent Provocateur&quot;, which reached No. 1 in the UK and included their biggest hit single, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;. The song topped the charts in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, reached No. 3 in Germany, and made the Top 10 in numerous other countries. A second hit from the album, &quot;That Was Yesterday&quot;, went Top 20 in the US.

After a break, Foreigner released &quot;Inside Information&quot; in 1987. Despite two more US Top 10 hits with &quot;Say You Will&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Live Without You&quot;, it became their first album not to achieve multi-platinum certification or reach the Top 10 in the US, achieving single platinum sales and peaking at No. 15. 

Since 1990, the band has undergone several lineup changes, including the departures of Elliott and Wills in 1991. Gramm left the band in 1990, returned in 1992, and departed again in 2003. The three studio albums released during this period—&quot;Unusual Heat&quot; (1991), &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; (1994), and &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; (2009)—were not major commercial successes. However, the 1992 greatest hits album, &quot;The Very Best ... and Beyond&quot;, which included three new songs, achieved 2× platinum certification in the US and gold certification in the UK.

Since 2003, Mick Jones has been the only founding member actively involved with Foreigner, though the band has occasionally toured without him in recent years. Two founding members, Ed Gagliardi and Ian McDonald, passed away in 2014 and 2022, respectively. Since 2013, there have been occasional quasi-reunion tours, concerts, and guest appearances featuring varying combinations of former band members, including Gramm, Elliott, Wills, Greenwood, and (before his death) McDonald. 

On October 19, 2024, Foreigner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Band history==
===Formation and debut album (1976-1977)===

Since the band&#x27;s inception, they have been led by English guitarist Mick Jones, a former member of Nero and the Gladiators, Johnny Hallyday&#x27;s band, Spooky Tooth, and the Leslie West band. After the collapse of the Leslie West Band in 1976, Jones found himself stranded in New York City. West&#x27;s manager, Bud Prager, encouraged Jones to continue his songwriting and rehearse a band of his own in some space Prager had near his New York office.

Jones connected with New York keyboardist Al Greenwood, who had recently played with former Flash members Colin Carter and Mike Hough in a group called Storm, drummer Stan Williams, and Louisiana bassist Jay Davis, who later performed with Rod Stewart. They began jamming together. Another friend, Stories singer Ian Lloyd, was brought in to sing; however, Jones decided the chemistry was not quite right and retained only Greenwood as he resumed his search for other players. During a session for Ian Lloyd&#x27;s album, Jones met transplanted English musician and former King Crimson founding member Ian McDonald. Another session, this one for Ian Hunter, led to his discovery of fellow Brit and drummer Dennis Elliott. 

Despite auditioning approximately forty to fifty singers, the group struggled to find the right vocalist until Jones revisited a Black Sheep album given to him backstage at a 1974 Spooky Tooth concert by that group&#x27;s lead singer, Lou Gramm. Jones reached out to Gramm, who had returned to his hometown of Rochester, New York following Black Sheep&#x27;s breakup, and sent him a plane ticket to New York City. Gramm proved to be the missing piece, and Brooklyn bassist Ed Gagliardi rounded out the sextet.

A name, &quot;Trigger,&quot; was tentatively chosen and appeared on the band&#x27;s demo tape, but it was rejected by all the record companies that received it. John Kalodner, a former journalist and radio programmer working in A&amp;R at Atlantic Records, noticed a tape labeled Trigger on Atlantic president Jerry L. Greenberg&#x27;s desk. Kalodner had recently listened to a band called Trigger and realized this was not the same group. He convinced Greenberg that at least one song on the tape had the potential to be a hit and urged him to consider signing the band immediately. Since the name Trigger was already taken, Jones proposed the name Foreigner, inspired by the fact that in any country they performed, three members—Jones, McDonald, and Elliott—would always be foreigners, as they were English, while Gramm, Greenwood, and Gagliardi were American.

In November 1976, after six months of rehearsals, the newly christened Foreigner began recording their debut album with producers John Sinclair and Gary Lyons at The Hit Factory. However, they later moved to Atlantic Recording Studios to finish recording the basic tracks and complete the overdubs. The initial mixing took place at Sarm Studios in London, but the band was dissatisfied with the results. They opted to remix the album at Atlantic with the involvement of Mick Jones, Ian McDonald, and Jimmy Douglass. Bud Prager signed on as the band&#x27;s manager and remained in that role for the next 17 years.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Foreigner&quot;, was released in March 1977 and achieved significant commercial success. It was certified for sales of five million copies in the United States, remaining in the top 20 for a year and peaking at No. 4. The album also reached the top 10 in Canada and Australia and climbed to No. 1 in Norway. &quot;Foreigner&quot; produced three major hits in North America: &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot; reached No. 4 in the US and No. 7 in Canada, &quot;Cold as Ice&quot; peaked at No. 6 in the US and No. 9 in Canada, and &quot;Long, Long Way from Home&quot; hit No. 20. Additionally, &quot;Cold as Ice&quot; saw moderate success in the UK, Australia, the Netherlands, and Belgium, reaching the top 20 or 30 in those countries.

=== 1977–1990 ===

By May 1977, Foreigner was already headlining theaters and had earned a gold record for their debut album. Shortly afterward, the band began selling out U.S. basketball arenas and hockey rinks. Following a show at Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas, on May 6, 1977, drummer Dennis Elliott injured his hand. The band brought in Ian Wallace (formerly of King Crimson) to assist Elliott by playing alongside him on some dates until his hand healed.

After nearly a year on the road, Foreigner performed for more than 200,000 people at California Jam II on March 18, 1978. The following month, they embarked on their first tour of Europe, Japan, and Australia.

Their second album, &quot;Double Vision&quot;, was released in June 1978 and co-produced by Keith Olsen. The album surpassed their debut in sales, achieving seven million copies sold in the US and peaking at No. 3 in both the US and Canada. In Australia, it reached No. 13. It became the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the UK, where it peaked at No. 32. However, &quot;Double Vision&quot; (as well as their next two albums) failed to chart in Norway, where their debut had reached No. 1. 

The album generated even greater hits in North America than their debut, with &quot;Hot Blooded&quot; reaching No. 3 in both the US and Canada, the title track &quot;Double Vision&quot; peaking at No. 2 in the US and No. 7 in Canada, and &quot;Blue Morning, Blue Day&quot; climbing to No. 15 and No. 21 respectively. Outside North America, only &quot;Hot Blooded&quot; made an impact, reaching No. 24 in Australia. The singles from &quot;Double Vision&quot; and their subsequent album, &quot;Head Games,&quot; saw little airplay or sales in other countries.

Album number three, &quot;Head Games&quot;, released in September 1979, was co-produced by Roy Thomas Baker. The album was described by Gramm as their &quot;grainiest&quot; album and was commercially successful, in part due to the success of the single &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot; and the title track &quot;Head Games&quot;. Both songs were top 15 hits in the US and Canada but did not chart in other countries. The album reached No. 5 in North America, but sales declined significantly in Australia (No. 45) with no improvement in other markets.

For &quot;Head Games&quot;, bassist Ed Gagliardi was replaced by Englishman Rick Wills. In his autobiography, &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; (named after the iconic Foreigner song), Gramm explained the reasons for the band&#x27;s decision to part ways with Gagliardi: &quot;He was a little headstrong and had his own ideas that weren&#x27;t always compatible with what we were trying to accomplish. Ed was obstinate at times, playing the song the way he wanted to play it rather than the way it was drawn up. Mick often had to stop sessions to get Ed back on track. After a while, it became tiresome and slowed down the recording process.&quot; Gramm also expressed disappointment with &quot;Head Games&quot;, stating that he felt it sounded unfinished. The album sold about two million copies fewer than its predecessor.

In September 1980, founding members Al Greenwood and Ian McDonald were dismissed. One reason for the dismissal was Jones&#x27;s desire for greater control over the band and to be the primary songwriter (along with Gramm). In his book, Gramm discussed this challenging period: &quot;The chemistry that made the band right in the beginning didn&#x27;t necessarily mean it would always be right. I think a pretty major communication lapse appeared, and I don&#x27;t think anybody really knew what anybody was feeling—the deep, inner belief about the direction of the band and how we were progressing. We had reached a point where there was a lot of dissatisfaction.&quot;

In the liner notes for the 2000 release, &quot;Juke Box Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology&quot;, Jones elaborated further: &quot;Ian McDonald, who I consider a great musician and multi-instrumentalist, began to focus more and more on guitar playing, while I believed his true talent lay more in the dimensional and creative imagery he gave the first two albums. Al Greenwood, our keyboard wiz and a very important part of the Foreigner sound at the beginning, had also started to focus more on songwriting. Although both their contributions to the band had been vital, a conflict was developing about the musical direction of the band. I just felt we needed to clarify it. So Lou, Rick, Dennis, and I made the decision, and that&#x27;s when we went down to four.&quot;

In 1999, McDonald said, &quot;Mick and Lou decided they wanted to be the focus of the band. Mick wanted to make it more apparent that it was his group, so he decided to make a smaller group. That was his decision. I wouldn&#x27;t have left—I loved the group, it was not my decision.&quot; McDonald noted that there was much creative compromise while working in the band and that he did more than he received credit for, much like he did in King Crimson.

McDonald stated, &quot;I had a lot to do with the making of those records and the arrangements and the creating of those songs, more than is probably apparent. I did a lot that went uncredited, which I was happy to do though. When you&#x27;re in a group, you must contribute as much as you can. I was happy to do that. But as I said, it maybe didn&#x27;t appear that I was doing as much as I in fact was. I had a lot to do with that group... as well as... Mick Jones, obviously, and everyone else—I&#x27;m not trying to take all the credit, but I&#x27;m just saying that I was there, I was involved, and I loved it.&quot;

The band was now reduced to a quartet, with session players brought in as needed for recording or touring (see below for a complete list of members). Greenwood soon joined Gagliardi to form the AOR band Spys, alongside John Blanco, Billy Milne, and John DiGaudio. The band released two albums, an eponymous debut and the follow-up, &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;.

In the meantime, Foreigner began work on the next album at Electric Lady Studios in New York City with producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, engineered by Dave Wittman (currently with Trans-Siberian Orchestra). &quot;4&quot; (released in July 1981) contained the hits &quot;Urgent&quot; (which includes the famous Junior Walker sax solo), &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;, &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;, and &quot;Break it Up&quot;. Thomas Dolby played synthesizers on &quot;4&quot; (he contributed the signature synth sound on &quot;Urgent&quot; and played the intro to &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;). &quot;4&quot; became Foreigner&#x27;s first and only No. 1 album in the US, spending 10 weeks in that position, and peaked at No. 2 in Canada. It also became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album overseas, reaching the top 5 in the UK, Germany, and Australia.

The first single, &quot;Urgent,&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the US Hot 100 and topped the US Album Rock Tracks chart and the Canadian RPM Singles Chart. It also became their biggest hit to date in Germany, reaching the top 15 there, higher than the other singles from the album, but was less successful in Australia, peaking at No. 24, and in the UK, where it did not chart. The second single, &quot;Juke Box Hero,&quot; was very successful on rock stations in North America, reaching No. 3 on the US Rock Tracks chart, but only reached No. 26 on the US Hot 100 and No. 39 in Canada, while reaching the top 30 in Germany and France, their first song to chart in the latter. The third single released, the power ballad &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You,&quot; went to No. 2 on the US Hot 100 for a record 10 consecutive weeks and, like &quot;Urgent,&quot; topped the US Rock Tracks chart. It also went to No. 2 in Canada and became their first single to reach the top 10 in the UK (No. 8) and Australia (No. 3), while reaching the top 20 in the Netherlands and Belgium and the top 30 in Germany and France.

For their 1981–82 tour in support of &quot;4&quot;, the group added Peter Reilich (keyboards, synthesizers, who had played with Gary Wright), former Peter Frampton band member Bob Mayo (keyboards, synthesizers, guitar, backing vocals), and Mark Rivera (sax, flute, keyboards, synthesizers, guitar, backing vocals). Mayo and Rivera had also appeared on the sessions for &quot;4&quot;. Reilich was dropped in May 1982, but Mayo and Rivera continued with the band through 1988.

&quot;Records&quot; (November 1982) was a compilation album spanning the band&#x27;s first four albums through 1981. This turned out to be the group&#x27;s best-selling record and was eventually certified 7× platinum by the RIAA.

Foreigner&#x27;s next album, &quot;Agent Provocateur&quot;, co-produced by Alex Sadkin, was released in December 1984 and, in 1985, gave them their first and only No. 1 hit song in the US and several other countries (except for Canada, where &quot;Urgent&quot; had reached No. 1) when &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, a ballad backed by Jennifer Holliday and the New Jersey Mass Choir, topped the charts in the US (both Hot 100 and Rock Tracks), UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and more, while reaching No. 3 in Germany (their only top 10 hit there), No. 4 in France (their only top 20 hit there), and No. 6 in both the Netherlands and Belgium. &quot;That Was Yesterday&quot; was the next single from the album in early 1985 and proved to be another sizable hit, reaching No. 12 on the US Hot 100 (No. 4 on Rock Tracks) and the top 30 in several other countries. The album was equally successful, becoming Foreigner&#x27;s only No. 1 album in the UK, Germany, and Norway, while reaching No. 3 in Australia (its biggest album there) and Canada, and No. 4 in the US and New Zealand (its biggest album there). It was certified 3× platinum in the US, their lowest-selling album to date in that country.

During their 1985 summer/fall tour, Foreigner appeared at the first Farm Aid on September 22 in Champaign, Illinois.

In between his Foreigner commitments, Jones also started a side career as a producer for albums such as Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;5150&quot; (1986), Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; (1986), and Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Storm Front&quot; (1989).

In December 1987, Foreigner released &quot;Inside Information&quot;, spawning hits such as &quot;Say You Will&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Live Without You&quot;. On May 14, 1988, the band headlined the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden, culminating with &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, in which the likes of Phil Collins, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Roberta Flack, and other Atlantic artists joined in, singing in the choir. Later during the summer of 1988, the band went back on the road, but touring for &quot;Inside Information&quot; was limited to Europe, Japan, and Australia. For this tour, Rivera and Mayo were not available, so Larry Oakes (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Lou Cortelezzi (sax) augmented the quartet of Gramm, Jones, Elliott, and Wills.

===1990-1992===

In the late 1980s, Jones and Gramm each released solo projects on Atlantic. Gramm released &quot;Ready or Not&quot; in January 1987, and shortly after its release, rehearsals for Foreigner&#x27;s next album began but stalled due to uncertainty about Gramm&#x27;s status with the band. However, after the promotional efforts and concert dates for Gramm&#x27;s album concluded, cooler heads prevailed, and Lou rejoined Foreigner in the studio for &quot;Inside Information&quot;, which was released at the end of 1987. Jones released &quot;Mick Jones&quot; in August 1989, followed by Gramm&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Long Hard Look&quot; (October 1989). Gramm decided to leave the group in May 1990 while preparing to tour in support of &quot;Long Hard Look&quot; as the opener for Steve Miller Band. After completing this tour, Gramm went on to form the short-lived band Shadow King, which released an eponymous album on Atlantic in October 1991.

Meanwhile, Jones recruited a new lead singer, Johnny Edwards, formerly of Buster Brown, Montrose, King Kobra, Northrup, and Wild Horses. Edwards made his first live appearance with Foreigner at the Long Island club Stephen Talkhouse on August 15, 1990, alongside Jones, Dennis Elliott, and Rick Wills, with special guests Terry Thomas on guitar and Eddie Mack on harmonica.

The new lineup of Foreigner released the album &quot;Unusual Heat&quot; in June 1991. This was their lowest-selling album at the time, peaking at No. 117 on the Billboard 200, although &quot;Lowdown and Dirty&quot; became a minor mainstream rock hit, reaching No. 4 on that chart.

In July 1991, the new lineup of Foreigner played several European dates before making their official U.S. debut on August 9 at the second night of a Billy Joel benefit concert at Deep Hollow Ranch in Montauk, New York, to raise funds for the preservation of Montauk Point Lighthouse.

For their 1991 tour, Jeff Jacobs, who had previously played in Joel&#x27;s band, was brought in as the new keyboardist, and Mark Rivera returned. During the fall leg of this tour, Elliott chose to leave the band after a concert at The Ritz in NYC on November 14, 1991, to pursue a career as a wood sculptor. Larry Aberman was recruited as a temporary replacement until Mark Schulman joined as drummer in 1992 and stayed for the next three years. Scott Gilman (guitar, sax, flute) joined the touring band in 1992, and Thom Gimbel took over from Gilman and Rivera later in 1992 after they left. When Gimbel joined Aerosmith in 1993, Gilman returned to handle the guitar, sax, and flute duties until Gimbel returned permanently in the spring of 1995.

===1992–2003===

During the Los Angeles riots, Mick Jones went to the Sunset Marquis Hotel in West Hollywood to meet with Lou Gramm, and they both found themselves sequestered by a city curfew. They decided to use their time together to revive their partnership. &quot;I flew to Los Angeles, during the riots,&quot; says Gramm. &quot;We got flown to John Wayne Airport instead of LAX because they were shooting at the planes. Mick and I were holed up in the Sunset Marquis in L.A., with armed security guards walking around on the roof. It was a little weird, to say the least.&quot;

Gramm rejoined Foreigner and brought along his Shadow King bandmate, bassist Bruce Turgon, to replace Wills, who had left after the band&#x27;s 1991 tour following a falling out with Jones. Gramm co-produced the band&#x27;s second greatest hits album, &quot;The Very Best ... and Beyond&quot; (September 1992), which included three new songs.

In October 1994, Foreigner released what was intended to be a comeback album, &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot;, in Japan. Featuring new drummer Mark Schulman and new keyboardist Jeff Jacobs, this album was not released in the U.S. until February 1995 and fared even worse than &quot;Unusual Heat&quot;. It peaked at only No. 136 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, although the ballad &quot;Until the End of Time&quot; became a minor hit, reaching No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In January 1995, Ron Wikso (who had played in the Storm with former Journey members Gregg Rolie and Ross Valory) took over drumming duties from Schulman, and Brian Tichy succeeded Wikso in 1998 before Schulman returned in 2000.

In April 1997, Gramm underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. The medications he was prescribed caused significant weight gain and weakened his singing voice.

By 1998, the band was back on the road, but Gramm was visibly struggling, and it took him several years to regain the confidence to perform comfortably on stage.

In the summer of 1999, Foreigner toured as the opening act for Journey, and the following summer, during the band&#x27;s 2000 summer tour, Jeff Jacobs had to leave for a short time while his wife was giving birth to their child. Keyboardist John Purdell (who had co-produced the new tracks on their 1992 album &quot;The Very Best of ... and Beyond&quot;) stepped in to substitute for Jacobs until he could return.

In 2001, the Warner Music Group selected &quot;Foreigner&quot; and &quot;4&quot; to be among the first albums from their catalog to be remastered, enhanced, and released in the new DVD Audio format.

The 25th Anniversary Year in 2002 brought confirmation of the enduring respect for Foreigner&#x27;s recordings, with Rhino Entertainment reissuing the multi-platinum albums from 1977 to 1981 in special enhanced formats. &quot;Foreigner&quot;, &quot;Double Vision&quot;, &quot;Head Games&quot;, and &quot;4&quot; were given attention by Rhino&#x27;s staff, featuring new photos, liner notes, and bonus tracks of previously unreleased material. New greatest hits albums were also produced in the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. version reached No. 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album chart.

For the group&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Tour in 2002, they were joined by former Heart and Montrose drummer Denny Carmassi.

In late October/early November and then December 2002, Foreigner performed in Belgium and Germany at the annual Night of the Proms festival. This marked the last time Lou Gramm and Mick Jones would perform together until June 2013. Gramm left the group permanently in early 2003. Jones noted that he and Gramm parted ways because of a lack of communication: &quot;I think we really tried hard to save it, but it got to the point when we both realized that to go on would be detrimental for both of us.&quot;

===2005–2012===

Jones, the founder and only remaining original member of Foreigner, decided to take some time off before seeking to form a new lineup in 2004. On July 25, 2004, in Santa Barbara, California, at Fess Parker&#x27;s DoubleTree Resort, Jones performed at a benefit show for muscular dystrophy called &quot;Mick Jones &amp; Friends,&quot; which featured: Jeff Jacobs, Thom Gimbel, former Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson, future Black Country Communion drummer Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and leader of Bonham), and Bonham singer Chas West. West was the frontman for that show only. Inspired by the event and encouraged by Jason Bonham, Jones continued searching for a new frontman. He eventually found former Hurricane singer Kelly Hansen, who had sent the band an audition tape and was invited to join in March 2005. Hansen made his debut with the group on March 11 at Boulder Station near Las Vegas.

During their 2005 spring tour, Chas West briefly appeared with the band as a special guest, playing rhythm guitar.

Their 2005 BMG album, &quot;Extended Versions&quot;, featured the new lineup performing all their classic hits live in concert, noted for being one of the most &quot;studio-like, clean sounding&quot; live album recordings produced.
Foreigner toured with Def Leppard and Styx in 2007. They also toured extensively on their own in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their debut album&#x27;s release.

In September 2007, it was announced that Foreigner would join Pete Townshend, Bill Wyman and the Rhythm Kings, and Paolo Nutini as openers for the one-night-only Led Zeppelin reunion show in honor of Atlantic Records&#x27; Ahmet Ertegun. The show took place on December 10, 2007, in London, England, having been postponed by two weeks due to Jimmy Page fracturing a finger. 

In late 2007, keyboardist Jeff Jacobs left Foreigner after 16 years and was replaced first by Paul Mirkovich and then by Michael Bluestein in 2008. Bonham also parted ways with Foreigner in 2008, and Bryan Head was brought in to replace him. However, Head&#x27;s tenure was short, and he was soon replaced by the returning Tichy.

The band released a greatest hits anthology on July 15, 2008, titled &quot;No End in Sight: The Very Best of Foreigner&quot;. The anthology included all of their greatest hits, along with new live recordings and a new studio track, &quot;Too Late,&quot; which marked their first new song release since the 1994 album &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; and the first recorded output of the new lineup. &quot;Too Late&quot; was released as a single on June 17, 2008.

Foreigner released a new album on September 29, 2009, titled &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;. It was one of several recent classic rock releases (AC/DC, the Eagles, Journey, and Kiss being four others) that were released exclusively through the Walmart store chain in the U.S., while in Europe, the album was released by earMUSIC (a label part of the Edel group), charting in the top 20 in Germany (No. 16) and the top 30 in Switzerland. &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; debuted at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first two singles from the album, &quot;When It Comes to Love&quot; and &quot;In Pieces,&quot; both reached the top 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart. In 2010, the album was awarded a gold certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies throughout Europe.

In early 2010, Foreigner teamed up with Styx and Kansas for the United in Rock Tour. On May 4, 2010, it was announced that Jason Sutter would replace Brian Tichy as drummer. Sutter&#x27;s time with the band was brief, as he left by 2011. Mark Schulman then returned to Foreigner for his third stint as drummer. On February 20, 2011, the band performed for the first time in Bangalore, India, along with sitar player Niladri Kumar. In June 2011, Foreigner (again with Styx) co-headlined with Journey on their UK tour. Following this, they joined Journey and Night Ranger for a triple bill summer/fall tour of the US. For some dates on this tour, Brian Tichy substituted for Foreigner&#x27;s drummer Mark Schulman when Schulman was unavailable.

From August 19 to September 10, 2011, Night Ranger guitarist Joel Hoekstra played double duty, performing for NR while also substituting for Jones, who had fallen ill. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Bruce Watson (formerly of Rod Stewart) was brought in as Jones&#x27; replacement for the remaining tour dates and continued to tour with the group when they resumed touring in February 2012 after Jones underwent aortoiliac bypass surgery in Miami.

On October 4, 2011, Foreigner released &quot;Acoustique&quot;, which featured their most popular and well-known songs along with some newer tracks, recorded in a stripped-down, acoustic format.

In May 2012, after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer, Bluestein was forced to take a leave of absence from the band. Ollie Marland stepped in as his replacement on keyboards. Bluestein returned to the band in August 2012, and Tichy rejoined in the interim until his commitments with Whitesnake required his departure. In September 2012, Chris Frazier, whom Tichy had replaced in Whitesnake, became Foreigner&#x27;s new percussionist.

On August 31, 2012, after over a year away, Jones returned to the concert stage at Atlanta&#x27;s Chastain Park. Guitarist Watson, meanwhile, remained in the group, which proved helpful due to Jones&#x27; frequent health-related absences, which continued. At this same show, keyboardist Derek Hilland (formerly of Iron Butterfly, Whitesnake, and Rick Springfield) joined the band to substitute for Bluestein for the group&#x27;s late summer/fall tour dates and again during the winter/spring of 2013 until Bluestein was able to return.

===2013–present===
On January 9, 2013, the band&#x27;s original drummer, Dennis Elliott, joined Foreigner on stage at the Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood, Florida, to perform &quot;Hot Blooded&quot;.

In addition to touring small clubs and venues, the band is frequently hired for private parties and conventions, including performances at SeaWorld in Orlando for an IBM Rational Conference (June 6, 2012), at the Gaylord convention center in Washington, D.C., for the Teradata Partners 2012 conference (October 25, 2012), and at SAP&#x27;s Field Kickoff Meeting in Las Vegas (January 23, 2013).

On June 13, 2013, at the 44th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Award Ceremony, Jones and Gramm were officially inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Billy Joel was present to induct Jones and Gramm, singing snippets of Foreigner&#x27;s hits during his introduction speech. Jones expressed pride in the honor, stating that it made his work &quot;legit&quot;. The duo then took the stage one more time and, along with Thom Gimbel and the house band, performed &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; and &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; with Anthony Morgan&#x27;s Inspirational Choir of Harlem—a performance that brought the entire audience to its feet.

Original bassist Ed Gagliardi died on May 11, 2014, aged 62, after an eight-year battle with cancer. Although discussions about a reunion of the original members had been proposed, the original band had not performed together since 1979.

In 2014, Foreigner teamed up with Styx and former Eagles guitarist Don Felder for the Soundtrack of Summer Tour. On June 18, 2014, Foreigner collaborated with the Brockton High School concert choir at the Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston, where they performed one of their greatest hits, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;.

On January 12, 2015, in Sarasota, Florida, Foreigner were joined on stage by original drummer Dennis Elliott and former bassist Rick Wills to perform &quot;Hot Blooded&quot;.

In Hartford, Connecticut on June 24, 2015, Foreigner began a summer tour as the opening act for Kid Rock.

Foreigner appeared on the &quot;Today Show&quot; on February 11, 2016, along with the choir from Our Lady of Mercy Academy to promote their Acoustic Tour and the release of their new album, &quot;In Concert: Unplugged&quot;. On September 24, 2016, Foreigner performed before an estimated 20,000 people at the 100th anniversary of the Durham Fair in Durham, Connecticut. The encore song, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, featured the local Coginchaug Regional High School concert choir after several months of rehearsals with the band over Skype in the months leading up to the concert.

In a 2016 interview, Jones discussed the possibility of a 40th anniversary reunion tour featuring the &quot;Head Games&quot;-era lineup: &quot;It&#x27;s quite possible. We&#x27;ve actually been talking about it. I&#x27;m not at a point where I can say it&#x27;s definitely gonna happen, but we&#x27;re all working on trying to make it happen. It&#x27;s kind of exciting. And hopefully, it&#x27;ll be feasible and possible to pull it off next year (2017). Lou (Gramm) and I have communicated and we&#x27;ve kept up a sort of loose communication as I have actually also with Ian McDonald, Al Greenwood, Dennis Elliott, and Rick Wills. We&#x27;re at the early stages, but we&#x27;re trying to put something together to commemorate (it&#x27;s scary when I say it) 40 years.&quot;
On November 25, 2016, in celebration of their 40th anniversary, Foreigner released a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl EP, &quot;The Flame Still Burns&quot;, on Rhino Records for Record Store Day&#x27;s Black Friday event. The EP&#x27;s track listing included the title song (which had previously appeared on Foreigner&#x27;s &quot;Acoustique&quot; album and had earlier been featured in the 1998 film &quot;Still Crazy&quot;) as well as live &quot;unplugged&quot; versions of &quot;Feels Like the First Time,&quot; &quot;Long, Long Way from Home,&quot; and &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;.

On July 20, 2017, at Jones Beach Theater on Long Island, the current Foreigner lineup was joined for their encore by Lou Gramm, Ian McDonald, and Al Greenwood to help celebrate the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary. Greenwood and McDonald returned the following year to perform with the group at their Jones Beach show on June 22, 2018. Dennis Elliott likewise joined his former bandmates for two songs at Foreigner&#x27;s show on August 2, 2017, at MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre in Tampa. Another reunion was announced for a pair of shows on October 6–7, 2017, at the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where the group was again joined by Lou Gramm, Dennis Elliott, Al Greenwood, Ian McDonald, and Rick Wills. The concerts were filmed for future release to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album &quot;Double Vision&quot;. &quot;Foreigner - Double Vision: Then and Now&quot; was later released (on November 15, 2019) as a concert film/documentary (in various options, including bundles of the concert film/documentary with either a CD or limited edition double LP live album).&lt;ref name=&quot;Double Vision: Then and Now live album/concert film/documentary 2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2018 interview with &quot;OC Weekly&quot;, bassist Jeff Pilson stated that Foreigner had no plans to release a new studio album but would continue to release singles periodically.

On November 9, 2018, all surviving original members of Foreigner joined the current lineup on stage for a show at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, marking the beginning of the &quot;Foreigner Then and Now&quot; concert series, which ran through the end of the year.

In October 2019, the group was set to be joined once again by the surviving original members for a series of shows as part of the Double Vision: Then and Now tour. However, on October 2, it was announced that Lou Gramm would not be participating in these dates due to illness.

Also in 2019, a jukebox musical titled &quot;Jukebox Hero,&quot; named after Foreigner&#x27;s hit single and featuring the band&#x27;s catalog, debuted. While being interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about the musical, Gramm mentioned that he and Jones were considering revisiting several songs that the two had written before Gramm&#x27;s second departure in 2003.

Foreigner announced a 2020 summer tour with support from Kansas and Europe called &quot;Juke Box Heroes,&quot; named after the song of the same name. On May 19, 2020, Foreigner announced that the band&#x27;s Juke Box Heroes 2020 Tour was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On March 18, 2021, Pilson announced that Thom Gimbel would be departing from the band. Gimbel was replaced by rhythm guitarist Luis Maldonado. Pilson later confirmed on March 20, 2021, that Foreigner was working on new music: &quot;[But] we are working on some music. So I think that what&#x27;s gonna happen is whatever other things we release in the next couple of years, there will be some new songs added to it. So that&#x27;s what I see kind of happening. &#x27;Cause we&#x27;re working on a few that are not that far away. So I would say expect a package deal to have a couple of new songs on it.&quot;

Jones was absent from the band&#x27;s 2021 tour, leaving no members from the original or classic lineup. As a result, none of the band&#x27;s lineup for the tour played on the original versions of any songs.

Founding member Ian McDonald died from colon cancer at his home in New York City on February 9, 2022, at the age of 75.

In 2022, the band was announced to be opening for Kid Rock on select dates for his Bad Reputation Tour.

In August 2022, in an interview with John Beaudin of the YouTube music news channel &quot;Rock Music History,&quot; original lead singer Lou Gramm stated that he would not likely participate in any potential future reunion concerts with other members from the band&#x27;s original and classic lineups. Gramm was dismayed for multiple reasons, including the deaths of two original members: bassist Ed Gagliardi (who died in 2014, before the various reunion concerts) and rhythm guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald (who died in 2022 after having participated in reunion concerts prior to the coronavirus pandemic). Gramm also cited Jones&#x27; reduced participation, and often lack of participation, in the band&#x27;s recent concerts as a result of Jones&#x27; continued health issues; Gramm reported that Jones:

As stated previously, when Jones&#x27; performance is reduced, or when he is absent from concerts, what Gramm refers to as &quot;the new Foreigner&quot; is often left without any original members performing. Gramm also revealed his opinion of current lead singer Kelly Hansen, stating that Hansen was &quot;all right&quot; and &quot;a good singer&quot;; however, Gramm believes that Jones has limited Hansen&#x27;s abilities by having Hansen &quot;study&quot; and &quot;[mimic]&quot; Gramm&#x27;s vocal performances. Gramm said that he does not &quot;take it as a compliment. You&#x27;re a singer with a big band like that - use &quot;your&quot; voice and &quot;your&quot; style. Don&#x27;t hang your coat on &quot;my&quot; hook&quot; (italics found in original text).

On November 14, 2022, the band announced that they would be embarking on their farewell tour (referred to in different sources as &quot;The Historic Farewell Tour&quot; and the &quot;Feels Like the Last Time Farewell Tour&quot;), which began in 2023 and will conclude in 2024. Similar to his previous health issues in 2011 and 2012, Jones has thus far been absent during Foreigner&#x27;s farewell tour.

In December 2023 and January 2024, it was announced that Foreigner and Styx would reunite for the co-headlining &quot;Renegades &amp; Juke Box Heroes Tour&quot; (with opening act and &quot;special guest&quot; John Waite), which was described by Tim Chan of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a string of summer [2024] dates across North America.&quot; It is unclear whether this is considered a temporary interruption of the farewell tour (as it features a new tour name) or a continuation of the farewell tour (as described by lead singer Hansen and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;). Foreigner also announced the release of a Dolby Atmos mix of their compilation album &quot;Records&quot; to promote the tour.

In 2024, Foreigner was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The inducted members are founding members Mick Jones, Lou Gramm, Dennis Elliott, Al Greenwood, the late Ian McDonald, and the late Ed Gagliardi, as well as Gagliardi&#x27;s replacement, longtime bassist Rick Wills.

In February 2024, Foreigner&#x27;s Mick Jones revealed that he had been battling Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which had impacted his ability to participate fully in performances. This included either skipping shows or limiting the number of songs he played at concerts, depending on the specific event or tour. 

In March, Kelly Hansen (lead singer) and Jeff Pilson (bassist) expressed that there might be potential for the band to release new material. They noted having unfinished songs from previous years and shared that Jones had been collaborating with &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Now&quot; co-producer Marti Frederiksen on new writing projects. Additionally, manager Phil Carson suggested that Foreigner&#x27;s farewell tour could extend into 2025 and potentially 2026, which would align with the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary. 

Former lead vocalist Lou Gramm also shared that he had inadvertently given Jones the only copy of &quot;eight or nine&quot; unreleased songs that the two had worked on prior to his departure from the band in 2003. Gramm revealed that Jones and manager Phil Carson were resistant to making a new copy for him. Despite prior comments in August 2022, Gramm confirmed his intention to join the band for a brief two-song set at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2024, which would include &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; and another song. Gramm also expressed that he planned to retire from performing at the end of 2024 and was interested in recording an album featuring the unreleased material with Jones and Foreigner.

Gramm also claimed that he had no memory of performing with Jones or other classic-era Foreigner members in 2017 and 2018, nor of an interview they did together in 2019. He stated that he had not spoken to or performed with Jones since 2013, when they were inducted into the Songwriters&#x27; Hall of Fame.

In August 2024, Foreigner released a previously unreleased single titled &quot;Turning Back the Time,&quot; which was originally written and demoed in 1996 by Jones, Gramm, and Frederiksen. Following the announcement of the band&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Jones and Frederiksen decided to revisit the track. The song featured Gramm&#x27;s original lead vocals, Jones on guitar and keyboards, Frederiksen on guitar and bass, and Frederiksen&#x27;s son Evan on drums. No other members of Foreigner contributed to the song. In addition to being released as a single, &quot;Turning Back the Time&quot; was the title track of a new compilation album.

<text>Zaydism () is a branch of Shia Islam that emerged in the eighth century following Zayd ibn Ali&#x27;s unsuccessful rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate. Zaydism is one of the three main branches of Shi&#x27;ism, with the other two being Twelverism and Ismailism. Zaydism is typically considered the Shia branch that is closest to Sunni Islam, although the &quot;classical&quot; form of Zaydism (usually referred to as Hadawi) had historically changed its stance on Sunni and Shia traditions multiple times, to the point where Zaydis simply accepting Ali as a rightful successor to Muhammad was enough to consider them Shia. Twelver Shias sometimes consider Zaydism to be a &quot;fifth school&quot; of Sunni Islam. Zaydis regard rationalism as more important than Quranic literalism and historically were quite tolerant towards Sunni Shafi&#x27;ism, a religion of about half of the Yemenis. 

Most of the world&#x27;s Zaydis are located in northern Yemen and Najran, Saudi Arabia.

==History==

In the 7th century some early Muslims expected Ali to become a first caliph, successor to Muhammad. After ascension of Abu Bakr, supporters of Ali (and future Shia) continued to believe only people from Muhammad&#x27;s family to qualify as rulers and selected an imam, from each generation (the proto-Sunni, in contrast, recognized Abu Bakr as a legitimate first caliph). The Zaydis emerged in reverence of Zayd ibn Ali&#x27;s failed uprising against the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (). While a majority of the early Shia recognized Zayd&#x27;s brother, Muhammad al-Baqir, as the fifth leader, some considered Zayd as the fifth imam, and thus in the 8th century formed the Zaydi or &quot;Fivers&quot; offshoot of Islam.

The Zaydis formed the states in what is now known as northern Iran (Tabaristan, 864 CE, by Hasan ibn Zayd, expanded to Daylam and Gilan) and later in Yemen (893 CE, by al-Hadi ila&#x27;l-Haqq Yahya). The Zaydis on the Caspian Sea were forcefully converted to Twelver Shi&#x27;ism in the 16th century.

The Zaydis in Yemen had initially lived in the highlands and the northern territories, but extent of their dominance away from their capital of 7 centuries, Saada, had been changing over time. Rassid dynasty was established after an Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. After another interaction with Ottomans, a new succession line was started in the 19th century by Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din. With minor interruptions, these two dynasties ruled in Yemen until the creation of Yemen Arab Republic in 1962. While the rulers ostensibly conformed to Hadawi law (thus the &quot;imamate&quot;), the doctrines had to be modified to allow hereditary, as opposed to traditional merit-based, selection of imams.

The end of imam rule in 1962, with the new rulers in Yemen no longer conforming to the requirements of Zaydism, caused Zaydi scholars to call for the restoration of the imamate. This contributed to the North Yemen Civil War that lasted from 1962 to 1970. The national reconciliation of 1970 paused the fighting with traumatized Zaydis following three main routes:
* joining the new political system (the religious Party of Truth was created in 1990);
* restoring the spiritual and cultural heritage of Zaydism by opening religious centers and encouraging the tribes to send their youth for education there;
* preparing for the future fighting (Houthi movement founder Hussein al-Houthi was readying the militia).

==Law==
In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd Ibn &#x27;Ali&#x27;s teachings which are documented in his book &quot;Majmu&#x27; Al-Fiqh&quot; (). Zaydi &quot;fiqh&quot; is similar to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, as well as the Ibadi school. Abu Hanifa, the founder of the Hanafi school, was favorable and even donated towards the Zaydi cause. Zaydis dismiss religious dissimulation (taqiyya). Zaydism does not rely heavily on &quot;hadith&quot;, but uses those that are consistent with the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, and is open to &quot;hadith&quot;. Some sources argue that Zaydism is simply a philosophy of political government that justifies the overthrow of unjust rulers and prioritizes those who are Ahl al-Bayt.

==Theology==
Haider states that mainstream Zaydism (Hadawi) is a result of interaction of two currents, Batrism and Jarudism, their followers brought together during the original Zayd&#x27;s rebellion. These names, also designated as Batri and Jarudi, do not necessarily represent cohesive groups of people, for example, Batrism ideas (proto-Sunni) were dominant among Zaydi in the 8th century, and Jarudism (Shia) took over in the 9th century. The following table summarizes the differences between Batri and Jarudi beliefs per Haider:

Zaydis&#x27; theological literature puts an emphasis on social justice and human responsibility, and its political implications, i.e. Muslims have an ethical and legal obligation by their religion to rise up and depose unjust leaders including unrighteous sultans and caliphs.

===Beliefs===
Zaydis believe Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the imamate because he led a rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate, which he believed was tyrannical and corrupt. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action and the followers of Zayd believed that a true Imām must fight against corrupt rulers. The renowned Muslim jurist Abu Hanifa, who is credited with founding the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, delivered a fatwā or legal statement in favour of Zayd in his rebellion against the Umayyad ruler. He also urged people in secret to join the uprising and delivered funds to Zayd.

Unlike Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili Shi&#x27;ism, Zaydis do not believe in the infallibility of Imams and reject the notion of nass imamate. but believe that an Imam can be any descendant of Hasan ibn ʻAlī or Husayn ibn ʻAlī. Zaydis believe that Zayd ibn Ali in his last hour was betrayed by the people in Kufa.

Zaydis reject anthropomorphism and instead, take a rationalist approach to scriptural uses of anthropomorphic expressions, as illustrated in works such as the &quot;Kitāb al-Mustarshid&quot; by the 9th-century Zaydi imam al-Qasim al-Rassi.

==Status of Caliphs and the Sahaba==

There was a difference of opinion among the companions and supporters of Zayd ibn &#x27;Ali, such as Abu al-Jarud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad, Sulayman ibn Jarir, Kathir al-Nawa al-Abtar and Hasan ibn Salih, concerning the status of the first three Rashidun caliphs who succeeded to the political and administrative authority of Muhammad. The earliest group, called Jarudiyya (named for Abu al-Jarud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad), was opposed to the approval of certain companions of Muhammad. They held that there was sufficient description given by Muhammad that all should have recognized Ali as the rightful caliph. They therefore consider the companions wrong in failing to recognise &#x27;Ali as the legitimate Caliph and deny legitimacy to Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman; however, they avoid accusing them.

The Jarudiyya were active during the late Umayyad Caliphate and early Abbasid Caliphate. Its views, although predominant among the later Zaydis, especially in Yemen under the Hadawi sub-sect, became extinct in Iraq and Iran due to forced conversion of the present religious sects to Twelver Shi&#x27;ism by the Safavid dynasty.

The second group, the Sulaymaniyya, named for Sulayman ibn Jarir, held that the Imamate should be a matter to be decided by consultation. They felt that the companions, including Abu Bakr and &#x27;Umar, had been in error in failing to follow &#x27;Ali but it did not amount to sin.

The third group is known as the Batriyya, Tabiriyya, or Salihiyya for Kathir an-Nawa al-Abtar and Hasan ibn Salih. Their beliefs are virtually identical to those of the Sulaymaniyya, except they see Uthman also as in error but not in sin.

The term rafida was a term used by Zayd ibn Ali on those who rejected him in his last hours for his refusal to condemn the first two Caliphs of the Muslim world, Abu Bakr and Umar. Zayd bitterly scolds the &quot;rejectors&quot; (&quot;rafidha&quot;) who deserted him, an appellation used by Salafis to refer to Twelver Shi&#x27;a to this day.
According to Zaydi traditions, &quot;Rāfiḍa&quot; referred to those Kufans who deserted and refused to support Zayd ibn Ali, who had a favourable view of the first two Rashidun Caliphs. The term &quot;Rāfiḍa&quot; became a popular pejorative term used by the Zaydi scholars against Imami Shias to criticize their rejection of Zayd ibn Ali.

===Twelver Shia references to Zayd===
While not one of the Twelve Imams embraced by Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, Zayd ibn Ali features in historical accounts within Twelver literature in a positive and negative light.

In Twelver accounts, Imam Ali al-Ridha narrated how his grandfather, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, also supported Zayd ibn Ali&#x27;s struggle:

Jafar al-Sadiq&#x27;s love for Zayd ibn Ali was so immense that he broke down and cried upon reading the letter informing him of his death and proclaimed:

However, in other hadiths, narrated in &quot;Al-Kafi&quot;, the main Shia book of hadith, Zayd ibn Ali is criticized by his half-brother, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, for his revolt against the Umayyad Dynasty. According to Alexander Shepard, an Islamic Studies specialist, much of Twelver ahadith and theology was written to counter Zaydism.

==Empires==
=== Justanids ===
The Justanids (Persian: جستانیان) were the rulers of a part of Daylam (the mountainous district of Gilan) from 791 to the late 11th century. After Marzuban ibn Justan converted to Islam in 805, the ancient family of Justan&#x27;s became connected to the Zaydi Alids of the Daylam region. The Justanids adopted the Zaydi form of Shi&#x27;ism.

=== Karkiya dynasty ===
The Karkiya dynasty, or Kia dynasty, was a Zaydi Shia dynasty which ruled over Bia pish (eastern Gilan) from the 1370s to 1592. They claimed Sasanian ancestry as well.

=== Alid dynasty ===
Alid dynasty of Tabaristan. See Alid dynasties of northern Iran.

=== Idrisid dynasty ===

The Idrisid dynasty was a Zaydi dynasty centered around modern-day Morocco which ruled from 788 to 974. It was named after its first leader Idris I.

=== Banu Ukhaidhir ===
The Banu Ukhaidhir was a dynasty that ruled in al-Yamamah (central Arabia) from 867 to at least the mid-eleventh century.

=== Hammudid dynasty ===
The Hammudid dynasty was a Zaydi dynasty in the 11th century in southern Spain.

=== Mutawakili ===

The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, also known as North Yemen, existed between 1918 and 1962 in the northern part of what is now Yemen. Its capital was Sana&#x27;a until 1948, then Ta&#x27;izz.

==Community and former states==
Since the earliest form of Zaydism was Jaroudiah, many of the first Zaidi states were supporters of its position, such as those of the Iranian Alavids of Mazandaran province and the Buyid dynasty of Gilan province and the Arab dynasties of the Banu Ukhaidhir of al-Yamama (modern Saudi Arabia) and the Rassids of Yemen. The Idrisid dynasty in the western Maghreb were another Arab Zaydi dynasty, ruling 788–985.

The Alavids established a Zaydi state in Deylaman and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864; it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the Sunni Samanids in 928. Roughly forty years later, the state was revived in Gilan (northwest Iran) and survived until 1126. Historically, there was a small community of Zaydi Kurds between Iran and Iraq.

From the 12th–13th centuries, Zaydi communities acknowledged the Imams of Yemen or rival Imams within Iran.

The Buyid dynasty was initially Zaidi as were the Banu Ukhaidhir rulers of al-Yamama in the 9th and 10th centuries.

The leader of the Zaidi community took the title of Caliph. As such, the ruler of Yemen was known as the Caliph. Al-Hadi ila&#x27;l-Haqq Yahya, a descendant of Imam Hasan ibn Ali, founded this Rassid state at Sa&#x27;da, al-Yaman, in c. 893–897. The Rassid Imamate continued until the middle of the 20th century, when a 1962 revolution deposed the Imam. After the fall of the Zaydi Imamate in 1962 many Zaydi Shia in northern Yemen had converted to Sunni Islam.

The Rassid state was founded under Jarudiyya thought; however, increasing interactions with Hanafi and Shafi&#x27;i schools of Sunni Islam led to a shift to Sulaimaniyyah thought, especially among the Hadawi sub-sect.

In the 21st century, the most prominent Zaidi movement is the &quot;Shabab Al Mu&#x27;mineen&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Houthis&quot;, who have been engaged in an uprising against the Yemeni Government, causing a grave humanitarian crisis in north Yemen.

Some Persian and Arab legends record that Zaidis fled to China from the Umayyads during the 8th century.

=== Houthi Yemen ===

Since 2004 in Yemen, Zaidi fighters have been waging an uprising against factions belonging to the Sunni majority group in the country. The Houthis, as they are often called, have asserted that their actions are for the defense of their community from the government and discrimination, though the Yemeni government in turn accused them of wishing to bring it down and institute religious law.

On 21 September 2014, an agreement was signed in Sana&#x27;a under UN patronage essentially giving the Houthis control of the government after a decade of conflict. Tribal militias then moved swiftly to consolidate their position in the capital, with the group officially declaring direct control over the state on 6 February 2015. This outcome followed the removal of Yemen&#x27;s President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2012 in the wake of protracted Arab Spring protests. Saudi Arabia has exercised the predominant external influence in Yemen since the withdrawal of Nasser&#x27;s Egyptian expeditionary force marking the end of the bitter North Yemen Civil War.

There is a wide array of domestic opponents to Houthi rule in Yemen, ranging from the conservative Sunni Islah Party to the secular socialist Southern Movement to the radical Islamists of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and, since 2014, the Islamic State – Yemen Province.

<text>The Miami Screaming Eagles were a professional ice hockey team that had intended to play in Miami, Florida, U.S. The Screaming Eagles were charter members of the World Hockey Association, but never played a game in Miami due to the only available arena being unfit for use. The franchise license was purchased and moved, becoming the Philadelphia Blazers for the WHA&#x27;s inaugural season.

==History==
The Screaming Eagles franchise was the second attempt at a professional hockey team for the South Florida market, since the folding of the original Tropical Hockey League in 1939. The first came two years prior; Seymour H. Knox III, Northrup R. Knox and Robert O. Swados, the owners of the Buffalo Sabres, were awarded an American Hockey League franchise in 1970. The Knox-Swados consortium intended on placing their AHL team in South Florida; the AHL refused to allow a team to play in a market that distant (the AHL had no teams south of Virginia at the time). The proposed team was instead placed in Cincinnati, Ohio and named the Cincinnati Swords.

Businessman Herb Martin bought a franchise in the WHA in 1972. The Screaming Eagles made a splash immediately by signing Bernie Parent from the Toronto Maple Leafs—the first National Hockey League star inked by the rebel league—and Boston Bruins standout Derek Sanderson. Martin developed a unique plan to build an arena within the walls of four office buildings to create what he called the Executive Square Arena. This new arena was to have been a showcase for the new league. The WHA had even planned to open their season in Miami on October 6, 1972 by hosting the Winnipeg Jets in the new arena. But the plans started to fall apart when Dade County officials halted construction of the proposed arena. The county faulted Martin for ignoring a zoning ordinance which required at least one parking spot for every four seats in an arena. At a league meeting in Chicago, the WHA rejected Miami&#x27;s $100,000 performance bond because the Eagles did not have a suitable arena.

With the end of the Executive Square project, the Screaming Eagles had only two options for a temporary home, Miami Beach Convention Center or the then-new Hollywood Sportatorium. But Martin felt neither site was suitable even for temporary use. The Convention Center held only a few thousand for hockey. The Sportatorium had no air conditioning, no permanent seats, and a partially open roof. (Later, when the arena was fully enclosed and expanded, attempts were made to bring in another WHA franchise, but to no avail.)

When Martin was unable to find a solution to the arena problem, WHA president Gary Davidson canceled the franchise on April
28, 1972. In June 1972, Bernard Brown and James Cooper were granted the rights to the Miami Screaming Eagles along with the players (namely Bernie Parent) that were under contract with the team, from Herb Martin. Brown and Cooper then relocated the franchise to Philadelphia (where Parent had previously played for the NHL Flyers, and would again) and renamed the team the Blazers.

Two decades later, South Florida was awarded the National Hockey League&#x27;s Florida Panthers franchise.

Although they never iced a team, replicas of the projected Screaming Eagles jersey continue to sell along with those of actual WHA teams.

<doc id="430098" wikidata="Q429742" url="?curid=430098" title="Aventurine">
<text>Aventurine is a form of quartzite, characterised by its translucency and the presence of platy mineral inclusions that give it a shimmering or glistening effect termed &quot;aventurescence&quot;.

==Background==
The most common color of aventurine is green, but it can also be orange, brown, yellow, blue, or grey. Chrome-bearing fuchsite (a variety of muscovite mica) is the classic inclusion and gives a silvery green or blue sheen. Oranges and browns are attributed to hematite or goethite. Because aventurine is a rock, its physical properties vary: its specific gravity may lie between 2.64–2.69 and its hardness is somewhat lower than single-crystal quartz at around 6.5.
Aventurine feldspar or sunstone can be confused with orange and red aventurine quartzite, although the former is generally of a higher transparency. Aventurine is often banded and an overabundance of fuchsite may render it opaque, in which case it may be mistaken for malachite at first glance.

The name &quot;aventurine&quot; derives from the Italian &quot;a ventura&quot; meaning &quot;by chance&quot;. This is an allusion to the lucky discovery of aventurine glass or goldstone at some point in the 18th century. One story is that this kind of glass was originally made accidentally at Murano by a workman, who let some copper filings fall into the molten &quot;metal&quot;, whence the product was called &quot;avventurino&quot;. From the Murano glass the name passed to the mineral, which displayed a rather similar appearance. Although it was known first, goldstone is now a common imitation of aventurine and sunstone. Goldstone is distinguished visually from the latter two minerals by its coarse flecks of copper, dispersed within the glass in an unnaturally uniform manner. It is usually a golden brown, but may also be found in blue or green.

The majority of green and blue-green aventurine originates in India (particularly in the vicinity of Mysore and Chennai) where it is employed by prolific artisans. Creamy white, gray and orange material is found in Chile, Spain and Russia. Most material is carved into beads and figurines with only the finer examples fashioned into cabochons, later being set into jewelry.

<doc id="430104" wikidata="Q113570" url="?curid=430104" title="Herb Gardner">
<text>Herbert George Gardner (December 28, 1934 – September 24, 2003) was an American commercial artist, cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Gardner was the son of a bar owner. His late brother, Robert Allen Gardner, was a professor of comparative psychology at the University of Nevada, Reno and is famous for teaming with his wife Beatrix Gardner on Project Washoe, the attempt to teach American Sign Language to a chimpanzee named Washoe.

==Comic strip==

Gardner was educated at New York&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts, Carnegie-Mellon University and Antioch College. While a student at Antioch, he began drawing &quot;The Nebbishes&quot;. The comic strip was picked up by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and syndicated to 60-75 major newspapers from 1959 to 1961. Even before syndication, the Gardner characters were a national craze, marketed on statuettes, studio cards, barware (including cocktail napkins), wall decorations and posters. In 1960, after &quot;the balloons were getting larger and larger, and there was hardly any drawing left&quot;, he dropped it and began writing plays.

==Plays and films==
Gardner is best known for his 1962 play &quot;A Thousand Clowns,&quot; which ran for 428 performances. He received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay for the successful 1965 movie adaptation. The play was revived in 1996 and 2001. Both the 1962 play and the movie starred Jason Robards, Jr. as Murray Burns, a charming, unemployed children&#x27;s show writer, who is forced to choose between social conformity and the probable loss of custody of his 11-year-old nephew to the Child Welfare Bureau. The Robards character was in part based on Gardner&#x27;s friend at that time, humorist Jean Shepherd. In 2000, Robards wrote: I feel &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot; is his masterpiece. It is a real human comedy of poignancy and laughter, with all of humanity&#x27;s foibles and eccentricities. There is a great depth of love and understanding for all in this play. There are great life lessons to learn daily, which I find myself still doing. For Herb Gardner to have written this play in his early twenties is a miracle.

Gardner&#x27;s biggest commercial success was the 1985 play &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot;, which ran for two years, won the Tony Award for Best Play and became the basis for a 1996 movie. 

Other Broadway credits include &quot;The Goodbye People&quot; (1968), &quot;Thieves&quot; (1974), and &quot;Conversations with My Father&quot; (1992). He collaborated with Jule Styne on the ill-fated 1980 musical &quot;One Night Stand&quot;.

==Novel==

Gardner&#x27;s autobiographical novel, &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;, was published in 1958. Gardner was the screenwriter and co-producer of the 1971 motion picture &quot;Who Is Harry Kellerman, and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?&quot;, which starred Dustin Hoffman. Gardner made a brief screen appearance as Rabbi Pierce in the 1987 motion picture &quot;Ishtar&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gardner married his first wife, actress Rita Gardner ( Schier), in 1957. The marriage ended in divorce in 1970.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was the boyfriend of actress Marlo Thomas.

In 1978 Gardner married Barbara Sproul, professor of religion at Hunter College, with whom he raised two adopted sons, Jake Gardner and Rafferty Gardner. They remained married until his death.

==Death==
Gardner died in his Manhattan apartment from complications of lung disease on September 25, 2003, aged 68.

<doc id="430105" wikidata="Q2967611" url="?curid=430105" title="Chuck Strahl">
<text>Charles Richard Strahl (February 25, 1957 – August 13, 2024) was a Canadian businessman and politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2011. First elected for the Reform Party, he was the leader of the Democratic Representative Caucus that left the Canadian Alliance in opposition to Stockwell Day&#x27;s leadership. When the Conservatives won power in 2006, he became a prominent cabinet minister and served as Minister of Agriculture, Indian and Northern Affairs, and Transportation.

On June 14, 2012, Strahl was appointed to serve a five-year term as chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, but resigned in controversy over conflict of interest accusations resulting from his lobbying efforts for oil and pipeline companies.

==Before politics==
Strahl was raised in British Columbia&#x27;s Interior, attended Trinity Western University, and worked for Cheam Construction, a logging and road-building company owned by his father Bill Strahl. Chuck Strahl and his siblings took over the business after their father died.

==Member of Parliament (1993–2011)==
Shortly after the business failed, Strahl ran for office under the Reform Party banner. He was first elected to office in the Reform Party sweep of the region in the 1993 election. He was re-elected in the 1997 and 2000 elections, running as a member of the Canadian Alliance, which had replaced Reform, in 2000. He represented Chilliwack—Fraser Canyon, a large riding comprising the Upper Fraser Valley, a primarily agricultural area of the province, and the Fraser Canyon-Lillooet-Bridge River regions, which are mostly wilderness with a resource-based economy and also, like the Chilliwack area, have a significant First Nations population. He held a number of shadow cabinet and committee positions.

Strahl rose into national prominence in the summer of 2001 when he was the leader and most outspoken member of a group of Canadian Alliance MPs that left the Alliance caucus and sat as members of the Democratic Representative Caucus.

Strahl&#x27;s own leadership ambitions were frustrated due to his inability to speak French as well as the lingering distrust among many colleagues over the perceived disloyalty shown to his party in 2001. He attempted to launch a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party, but was not able to secure enough financial or political support. Strahl then supported Tony Clement in his failed leadership bid.

At the outset of the 38th Parliament of Canada in October 2004, Strahl was appointed Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the Whole under the new rules brought about as a result of the Liberal minority government situation.

Strahl was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and Minister for the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) at the beginning of the 39th Parliament on 6 February 2006. Strahl removed upwards of 16,000 farmers from the voters list in the midst of the 2006 election to the CWB. They were disqualified for such reasons as not having delivered any grain to the Wheat Board in the previous two years or not having produced enough wheat or malt barley to have generated significant enough income from which to subsist. On 19 December 2006 he dismissed CWB president Adrian Measner, because &quot;It&#x27;s a position that [he] serves at pleasure. And that position was no longer his&quot; because he displeased the Cabinet.

Strahl was appointed Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status 
Indians in a cabinet shuffle on 14 August 2007. He added to his responsibilities the title of Minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency on 5 February 2010.

Between 6 August 2010 and 18 May 2011, Strahl was Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

===Health problems===
In August 2005, Strahl announced that he had lung cancer as the result of exposure to asbestos many years prior. The illness was diagnosed after one of his lungs collapsed twice.

However, despite his health problems, he successfully ran for re-election in the 2006 election. He later held various positions in the Cabinet such as Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, and Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

On March 12, 2011, Strahl announced he would not be seeking re-election in the upcoming federal election, which was held on May 2, 2011.

==Chair of Security Intelligence Review Committee (2012–2014) Controversy==
On June 14, 2012, Strahl was appointed to serve a five-year term as chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) - Canada&#x27;s spy agency watchdog. 
In January 2014, he resigned his position as chair after the media revealed that he was a registered lobbyist for the Enbridge Northern Gateway project.

Former Tory MP Deborah Grey, already a SIRC member, was appointed Strahl&#x27;s successor by Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

==Personal life==
Strahl married in 1975 and had four children.

On March 18, 2011, Mark Strahl succeeded his father as nominee for the Conservative Party in the riding of Chilliwack—Fraser Canyon. The nomination process, which is usually four weeks, lasted only a week. Mark Strahl was endorsed by Preston Manning, former leader of the Reform Party of Canada, who said &quot;Mark Strahl -- by virtue of his family background ... is well prepared for service in the House of Commons.&quot;

Former Chilliwack City Councillor Casey Langbroek said most Conservative Party members from the riding were upset and that the nomination process effectively barred 80% of party members from running. Party member Alex Moens said &quot;High public office should not be like a family business, where it&#x27;s passed on from father to son.&quot;

Strahl died after a prolonged battle with mesothelioma in Chilliwack, on August 13, 2024, at the age of 67.

<doc id="430106" wikidata="Q2297769" url="?curid=430106" title="Software agent">
<text>In computer science, a software agent is a computer program that acts for a user or another program in a relationship of agency.

The term &quot;agent&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;agere&quot; (to do): an agreement to act on one&#x27;s behalf. Such &quot;action on behalf of&quot; implies the authority to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Some agents are colloquially known as &quot;bots&quot;, from &quot;robot&quot;. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or as software such as a chatbot executing on a computer, such as a mobile device, e.g. Siri. Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Software agents interacting with people (e.g. chatbots, human-robot interaction environments) may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality or embody humanoid form (see Asimo).

Related and derived concepts include &quot;intelligent agents&quot; (in particular exhibiting some aspects of artificial intelligence, such as reasoning), &quot;autonomous agents&quot; (capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives), &quot;distributed&quot; agents (being executed on physically distinct computers), &quot;multi-agent systems&quot; (distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone), and &quot;mobile agents&quot; (agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors).

==Concepts==
The basic attributes of an autonomous software agent are that agents:
* are not strictly invoked for a task, but activate themselves,
* may reside in wait status on a host, perceiving context,
* may get to run status on a host upon starting conditions,
* do not require interaction of user,
* may invoke other tasks including communication.
The concept of an agent provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a complex software entity that is capable of acting with a certain degree of autonomy in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of its host. But unlike objects, which are defined in terms of &quot;methods&quot; and &quot;attributes&quot;, an agent is defined in terms of its behavior.

Various authors have proposed different definitions of agents, these commonly include concepts such as:
* &quot;persistence: c&quot;ode is not executed on demand but runs continuously and decides for itself when it should perform some activity;
* &quot;autonomy:&quot; agents have capabilities of task selection, prioritization, goal-directed behavior, decision-making without human intervention;
* &quot;social ability:&quot; agents are able to engage other components through some sort of communication and coordination, they may collaborate on a task;
* &quot;reactivity:&quot; agents perceive the context in which they operate and react to it appropriately.

===Distinguishing agents from programs===
All agents are programs, but not all programs are agents. Contrasting the term with related concepts may help clarify its meaning. Franklin &amp; Graesser (1997) discuss four key notions that distinguish agents from arbitrary programs: reaction to the environment, autonomy, goal-orientation and persistence.

===Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects===
* Agents are more autonomous than objects.
* Agents have flexible behavior: reactive, proactive, social.
* Agents have at least one thread of control but may have more.

===Distinguishing agents from expert systems===
* Expert systems are not coupled to their environment.
* Expert systems are not designed for reactive, proactive behavior.
* Expert systems do not consider social ability.

===Distinguishing intelligent software agents from intelligent agents in AI===
* Intelligent agents (also known as rational agents) are not just computer programs: they may also be machines, human beings, communities of human beings (such as firms) or anything that is capable of goal-directed behavior.

==Impact of software agents==
Software agents may offer various benefits to their end users by automating complex or repetitive tasks. However, there are organizational and cultural impacts of this technology that need to be considered prior to implementing software agents.

===Organizational impact===
===Work contentment and job satisfaction impact===
People like to perform easy tasks providing the sensation of success unless the repetition of the simple tasking is affecting the overall output. In general implementing software agents to perform administrative requirements provides a substantial increase in work contentment, as administering their own work does never please the worker. The effort freed up serves for a higher degree of engagement in the substantial tasks of individual work. Hence, software agents may provide the basics to implement self-controlled work, relieved from hierarchical controls and interference. Such conditions may be secured by application of software agents for required formal support.

===Cultural impact===
The cultural effects of the implementation of software agents include trust affliction, skills erosion, privacy attrition and social detachment. Some users may not feel entirely comfortable fully delegating important tasks to software applications. Those who start relying solely on intelligent agents may lose important skills, for example, relating to information literacy. In order to act on a user&#x27;s behalf, a software agent needs to have a complete understanding of a user&#x27;s profile, including his/her personal preferences. This, in turn, may lead to unpredictable privacy issues. When users start relying on their software agents more, especially for communication activities, they may lose contact with other human users and look at the world with the eyes of their agents. These consequences are what agent researchers and users must consider when dealing with intelligent agent technologies.

===History===
The concept of an agent can be traced back to Hewitt&#x27;s Actor Model (Hewitt, 1977) - &quot;A self-contained, interactive and concurrently-executing object, possessing internal state and communication capability.&quot;

To be more academic, software agent systems are a direct evolution of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS evolved from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Parallel AI (PAI), thus inheriting all characteristics (good and bad) from DAI and AI.

John Sculley&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Knowledge Navigator&quot; video portrayed an image of a relationship between end-users and agents. Being an ideal first, this field experienced a series of unsuccessful top-down implementations, instead of a piece-by-piece, bottom-up approach. The range of agent types is now (from 1990) broad: WWW, search engines, etc.

==Examples of intelligent software agents==
===Buyer agents (shopping bots)===
Buyer agents travel around a network (e.g. the internet) retrieving information about goods and services. These agents, also known as &#x27;shopping bots&#x27;, work very efficiently for commodity products such as CDs, books, electronic components, and other one-size-fits-all products. Buyer agents are typically optimized to allow for digital payment services used in e-commerce and traditional businesses.

===User agents (personal agents)===
User agents, or personal agents, are intelligent agents that take action on your behalf. In this category belong those intelligent agents that already perform, or will shortly perform, the following tasks:
* Check your e-mail, sort it according to the user&#x27;s order of preference, and alert you when important emails arrive.
* Play computer games as your opponent or patrol game areas for you.
* Assemble customized news reports for you. There are several versions of these, including CNN.
* Find information for you on the subject of your choice.
* Fill out forms on the Web automatically for you, storing your information for future reference
* Scan Web pages looking for and highlighting text that constitutes the &quot;important&quot; part of the information there
* Discuss topics with you ranging from your deepest fears to sports
* Facilitate with online job search duties by scanning known job boards and sending the resume to opportunities who meet the desired criteria
* Profile synchronization across heterogeneous social networks

===Monitoring-and-surveillance (predictive) agents===
Monitoring and surveillance agents are used to observe and report on equipment, usually computer systems. The agents may keep track of company inventory levels, observe competitors&#x27; prices and relay them back to the company, watch stock manipulation by insider trading and rumors, etc.
For example, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an agent that monitors inventory, planning, schedules equipment orders to keep costs down, and manages food storage facilities. These agents usually monitor complex computer networks that can keep track of the configuration of each computer connected to the network.

A special case of Monitoring-and-Surveillance agents are organizations of agents used to emulate the Human Decision-Making process during tactical operations. The agents monitor the status of assets (ammunition, weapons available, platforms for transport, etc.) and receive Goals (Missions) from higher level agents. The Agents then pursue the Goals with the Assets at hand, minimizing expenditure of the Assets while maximizing Goal Attainment. (See Popplewell, &quot;Agents and Applicability&quot;)

===Data-mining agents===
This agent uses information technology to find trends and patterns in an abundance of information from many different sources. The user can sort through this information in order to find whatever information they are seeking.

A data mining agent operates in a data warehouse discovering information. A &#x27;data warehouse&#x27; brings together information from many different sources. &quot;Data mining&quot; is the process of looking through the data warehouse to find information that you can use to take action, such as ways to increase sales or keep customers who are considering defecting.

&#x27;Classification&#x27; is one of the most common types of data mining, which finds patterns in information and categorizes them into different classes. Data mining agents can also detect major shifts in trends or a key indicator and can detect the presence of new information and alert you to it. For example, the agent may detect a decline in the construction industry for an economy; based on this relayed information construction companies will be able to make intelligent decisions regarding the hiring/firing of employees or the purchase/lease of equipment in order to best suit their firm.

===Networking and communicating agents===
Some other examples of current intelligent agents include some spam filters, game bots, and server monitoring tools. Search engine indexing bots also qualify as intelligent agents.
* User agent - for browsing the World Wide Web
* Mail transfer agent - For serving E-mail, such as &quot;Microsoft Outlook&quot;. Why? It communicates with the POP3 mail server, without users having to understand POP3 command protocols. It even has rule sets that filter mail for the user, thus sparing them the trouble of having to do it themselves.
* SNMP agent
* In Unix-style networking servers, &quot;httpd&quot; is an HTTP daemon that implements the Hypertext Transfer Protocol at the root of the World Wide Web
* Management agents used to manage telecom devices
* Crowd simulation for safety planning or 3D computer graphics,
* Wireless &quot;beaconing agent&quot; is a simple process hosted single tasking entity for implementing wireless lock or electronic leash in conjunction with more complex software agents hosted e.g. on wireless receivers.
* Use of autonomous agents (deliberately equipped with noise) to optimize coordination in groups online.

===Software development agents (aka software bots)===

Software bots are becoming important in software engineering.

=== Security agents ===
Agents are also used in software security application to intercept, examine and act on various types of content. Example include: 
* Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Agents - examine user operations on a computer or network, compare with policies specifying allowed actions, and take appropriate action (e.g. allow, alert, block). The more comprehensive DLP agents can also be used to perform EDR functions.
* Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Agents - monitor all activity on an endpoint computer in order to detect and respond to malicious activities 
*Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) Agents - similar to DLP Agents, however examining traffic going to cloud applications

==Design issues==
Issues to consider in the development of agent-based systems include 
* how tasks are scheduled and how synchronization of tasks is achieved
* how tasks are prioritized by agents
* how agents can collaborate, or recruit resources,
* how agents can be re-instantiated in different environments, and how their internal state can be stored,
* how the environment will be probed and how a change of environment leads to behavioral changes of the agents
* how messaging and communication can be achieved,
* what hierarchies of agents are useful (e.g. task execution agents, scheduling agents, resource providers ...).

For software agents to work together efficiently they must share semantics of their data elements. This can be done by having computer systems publish their metadata.

The definition of &quot;agent processing&quot; can be approached from two interrelated directions:
* internal state processing and ontologies for representing knowledge
* interaction protocols – standards for specifying communication of tasks

Agent systems are used to model real-world systems with concurrency or parallel processing.

* Agent Machinery – Engines of various kinds, which support the varying degrees of intelligence
* Agent Content – Data employed by the machinery in Reasoning and Learning
* Agent Access – Methods to enable the machinery to perceive content and perform actions as outcomes of Reasoning
* Agent Security – Concerns related to distributed computing, augmented by a few special concerns related to agents

The agent uses its access methods to go out into local and remote databases to forage for content. These access methods may include setting up news stream delivery to the agent, or retrieval from bulletin boards, or using a spider to walk the Web. The content that is retrieved in this way is probably already partially filtered – by the selection of the newsfeed or the databases that are searched. The agent next may use its detailed searching or language-processing machinery to extract keywords or signatures from the body of the content that has been received or retrieved. This abstracted content (or event) is then passed to the agent&#x27;s Reasoning or inferencing machinery in order to decide what to do with the new content. This process combines the event content with the rule-based or knowledge content provided by the user. If this process finds a good hit or match in the new content, the agent may use another piece of its machinery to do a more detailed search on the content. Finally, the agent may decide to take an action based on the new content; for example, to notify the user that an important event has occurred. This action is verified by a security function and then given the authority of the user. The agent makes use of a user-access method to deliver that message to the user. If the user confirms that the event is important by acting quickly on the notification, the agent may also employ its learning machinery to increase its weighting for this kind of event.

Bots can act on behalf of their creators to do good as well as bad. There are a few ways which bots can be created to demonstrate that they are designed with the best intention and are not built to do harm. This is first done by having a bot identify itself in the user-agent HTTP header when communicating with a site. The source IP address must also be validated to establish itself as legitimate. Next, the bot must also always respect a site&#x27;s robots.txt file since it has become the standard across most of the web. And like respecting the robots.txt file, bots should shy away from being too aggressive and respect any crawl delay instructions.

===Notions and frameworks for agents===

<doc id="430109" wikidata="Q2758792" url="?curid=430109" title="Shihad">
<text>Shihad are a rock band formed in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1988. The band consists of founders Tom Larkin (drums, backing vocals, samplers), Phil Knight (lead guitar, synthesiser, backing vocals) and Jon Toogood (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), who were joined by Karl Kippenberger (bass guitar, backing vocals) in 1991. The band were known as Pacifier between 2002 and 2004.

Six of Shihad&#x27;s studio albums have peaked at number one–&quot;The General Electric&quot; (October 1999), &quot;Pacifier&quot; (September 2002), &quot;Beautiful Machine&quot; (April 2008), &quot;Ignite&quot; (September 2010), &quot;FVEY&quot; (August 2014) and &quot;Old Gods&quot; (October 2021). They share the honour for most number-one records for any New Zealand artist with Hayley Westenra. As of 2014 Shihad had the most Top 40 New Zealand chart singles for any local artist, with 25; three of these reached the top ten. The singles &quot;Home Again&quot;, &quot;Pacifier&quot;, and &quot;Bitter&quot; are listed at No. 30, 60 and 83, respectively, in the &quot;Nature&#x27;s Best&quot; compilation, an official collection of New Zealand&#x27;s top 100 songs.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1988–1996) ===
Tom Larkin and Jon Toogood formed Exit in 1985 in Wellington with various short-term fellow school members. Larkin and Toogood had met at Wellington High School, and shared an interest in heavy metal. They were generally found in the school&#x27;s music room, as Toogood later recalled, &quot;That&#x27;s where we learnt to be a band – it had amps and a guitar and a drum-kit – that&#x27;s what kept us at school.&quot; During their Year 11 school ball, having no one to dance with, they spray-painted graffiti in the toilets, including &quot;AC/DC Rules&quot;, and were suspended from school.

Exit were renamed Shihad in mid-1988 when Geoff Duncan on bass guitar and Phil Knight on guitar joined. The new name was a misspelling of &quot;jihad&quot; (Arabic for &quot;striving&quot; or &quot;struggling&quot;) as used in Frank Herbert&#x27;s science-fiction novel, &quot;Dune&quot; (1965). They had heard the term when watching David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film of the same name. Larkin later told John Grayson of &quot;Opus&quot; (University of Newcastle, Australia), &quot;Well, see that&#x27;s the biggest cock-up out. When we were 15 we were all into this sci-fi movie &quot;Dune&quot;. See, &quot;Dune&quot; uses all these Arabic words throughout the movie and the end battle is a Jihad. We were stupid and thought it&#x27;d be a great name for a band so we called ourselves Shihad cause we couldn&#x27;t even spell it.&quot;

The group&#x27;s influences were Metallica and Slayer, and later included Pink Floyd, AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The group began performing in local pubs, even though they were under-age and performed cover versions of Metallica and Motörhead tracks. At Shihad&#x27;s debut performance they provided a cover version of Sex Pistol&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; but blew out the venue&#x27;s PA. Duncan left soon after and following a succession of temporary musicians they were joined in 1989 by Hamish Laing on bass guitar. In 1990, Gerald Dwyer, the former frontman of local punk band Flesh-D-Vice became their talent manager. He also managed Shihad&#x27;s then-support act, Head Like a Hole (HLAH).
The line-up of Knight, Larkin, Laing and Toogood recorded their debut track, &quot;Down Dance&quot;, which was issued in August 1990 as a B-side of a split single with the A-side, &quot;Dogs Are Talking&quot; by Australian group, the Angels. The other B-side, &quot;Live It Up&quot;, was by Auckland band, Nine Livez. Both Shihad and Nine Livez supported the Angels at their New Zealand shows during 1990. Shihad supported tours by international visitors, Faith No More and Motörhead. &quot;Down Dance&quot; also appeared on their first extended play, &quot;Devolve&quot; (1990) via Pagan Records, which was re-released in mid-1991 and reached the New Zealand singles chart top 20 in July. Another EP track, &quot;The Wizard&quot;, was a cover version of Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1970 work. Bridget Herlihy of &quot;Ambient Light&quot; described the EP as a &quot;thrash-metal affair&quot; with &quot;four hard and fast tracks.&quot;

In August 1991 Laing left and was replaced on bass guitar by Karl Kippenberger. Kippenberger&#x27;s second gig with the group was a support slot to AC/DC at Athletic Park, Wellington in front of an audience of 20,000. During 1992 Larkin and Toogood collaborated with Nigel Regan (of HLAH) on guitar in the side-project, SML, which later issued an album, &quot;Is That It?&quot;, in 1995. Shihad signed with Wildside Records to release their debut studio album, &quot;Churn&quot; (1993), which was produced by Jaz Coleman (of Killing Joke). It reached No. 9 on the New Zealand albums chart.

According to music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, &quot;their sound had grown more industrial under the influence of [Coleman].&quot; Herlihy noticed their sonation &quot;had evolved to be more mature; a fuller sound and slightly more melodic approach.&quot; The album provided their highest charting single, &quot;I Only Said&quot;, which peaked at No. 3. They toured both New Zealand and Australia. They were described by a &quot;Woroni&quot; writer, in September 1993, as an &quot;industrial metal band&quot; and &quot;despite coming out of a country only recently introduced to colour TV, this is damn close to the cutting edge of a very interesting genre.&quot; In February 1994 they performed at the Big Day Out concert in Auckland – the first time the roving festival occurred in New Zealand. The group signed with Noise Records in August for European releases and toured there for two months.

Their second album, &quot;Killjoy&quot;, was released in May 1995 and was co-produced by the group with Malcolm Welsford. It reached No. 4 and they followed with a tour of Western Europe supporting Faith No More for seven weeks. They remained in Europe for four months attending various festivals, Dynamo in Holland, the Phoenix Festival in Britain, and the Roskilde in Denmark. From September of that year they worked in the United States for three months including appearing at Foundations Forum alongside Motörhead, and at gigs in Los Angeles and New York City. At the 1996 New Zealand Music Awards they won four trophies, Album of the Year for &quot;Killjoy&quot;, Best Male Vocalist for Toogood, Best Group and International Achievement.

Their manager at the time Gerald Dwyer died of a morphine overdose just after Shihad&#x27;s performance at the 1996 Big Day Out, in Auckland. They had found Dwyer&#x27;s body in his motel room after returning from the gig. The group missed the Gold Coast concert to attend Dwyer&#x27;s funeral and then re-joined the Big Day Out tour in Sydney and continued to the other Australian venues.

=== Self-titled album and &quot;The General Electric&quot; (1996–2001) ===
The group started work on their third studio album, &quot;Shihad&quot;, in June 1996 at Auckland&#x27;s York Street Studios, co-produced by the group with Welsford, again. They also toured both New Zealand and Australia. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;La La Land&quot; (October 1996), received &quot;strong airplay support&quot; on Australia&#x27;s national youth radio station, Triple J. &quot;Shihad&quot; followed in the next month and peaked at No. 11 in New Zealand but did not reach in the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Nimmervoll observed, &quot;[it] marked a shift towards a more melodic sound.&quot; Jody Scott and Iain Shedden of &quot;The Australian&quot; felt they were their country&#x27;s &quot;most popular band&quot; and the album &quot;is bound to earn them universal favour.&quot; They appeared on the front cover of &quot;Rip It Up Magazine&quot;, with the accompanying article by John Russell describing their support slot for AC/DC&#x27;s Ballbreaker World Tour in Auckland in November 1996. Russell noticed, &quot;[they] battled for almost half an hour against audience indifference and the most horrid guitar sound I think they&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

From February 1997 they supported the European release of their album with concerts in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and United Kingdom. Along the way the group had briefly performed alongside Australian band Silverchair, who were on their first European tour. After that tour Shihad relocated to Melbourne as their base by 1998 and negotiated a contract with Warner Music Australasia. At Vancouver&#x27;s Factory Studios in mid-1999 they recorded their fourth studio album, &quot;The General Electric&quot; (October 1999) with Canadian producer Garth Richardson (Rage Against the Machine, Chevelle, Red Hot Chili Peppers). It is their first number-one album on the New Zealand charts and also reached the top 30 in Australia. Nimmervoll felt they &quot;welded the melody and harmony they had discovered on the self-titled album with multi-tracking experimentation and the hard edge in keeping with [their] live sound.&quot; While &quot;Sedate&quot;″s Brannavan Gnanalingam wrote, &quot;another classic album – tighter and more focused... [they] felt settled and creative, and experienced one of their most productive periods.&quot;

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Sedate&quot; (September 1999), reached the New Zealand top 10. Australian radio station, Double J&#x27;s programme &quot;Classic Albums&quot; revisited the album in September 2019 and its reviewer responded, &quot;[it] roars out of the blocks with an onslaught of vitriol in the song &#x27;My Mind&#x27;s Sedate&#x27;... [they] waste no time getting to one of many truths on their fourth album.&quot; Another popular track from the album, &quot;Pacifier&quot;, was issued in 2000 as the album&#x27;s third single. Double J&#x27;s reviewer continued, &quot;whilst tracks like &#x27;Wait and See&#x27; and &#x27;Pacifier&#x27; deliver a heavy dose of exhilaration as they swoop and soar. But, at their core, these songs are all born and bound together by a focused emotional, social and culturally rooted vision of the world at large.&quot;

&quot;Oz Music Project&quot;″s Delilah Dede caught their performance at The Playroom, Brisbane in March 2000 on a bill with Magic Dirt and Pretty Violet Stain. Dede observed, &quot;it&#x27;s hard not to like Toogood, with his Bobby Gillespie rock-star looks (without the pretensions), and the passion and blistering ferocity of Trent Reznor. The boy&#x27;s got charisma: he&#x27;s got stage presence, and he was bounding all over the stage: he has energy.&quot; She felt, &quot;their sound was hard and bangin&#x27;, pulled in with anthemic overflow, a touch of funk and electronica, and eloquent, gutsy lyrics. Bold and raw, yet pure poetry.&quot;

=== Naming conflict: Shihad to Pacifier (2001–2004) ===
Early in 2001 Shihad focused their attention on the US market and signed with an American-based management. They started work on their next album, &quot;Pacifier&quot; (September 2002) with Josh Abraham producing at Hollywood&#x27;s Pulse Recording Studios. However before recording was completed the September 11 attacks had occurred. Their management convinced the band to change their name due to the similarity between Shihad and the Arabic word &quot;jihad&quot;, which was now a sensitive term in the US. In January 2002 Shihad announced their intention to change their name, and at the 2002 Big Day Out concert in Auckland they sold T-shirts with Shihad and Remote printed below, indicating Remote was the new name. However due to Remote already being used, they settled on Pacifier, after the single from &quot;The General Electric&quot;. In mid-February their first performance as Pacifier occurred at the Viper Room, Los Angeles.

Some of their Australasian fan base was disappointed by the name change and protested with claims of the band selling out. Nevertheless the album reached number one in New Zealand and was their highest charting in Australia at No. 8. They had signed with US label, Arista Records for its North American release, which had a different track listing and included the track, &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Sedate&quot; from &quot;The General Electric&quot;. &quot;Pacifier&quot;″s third single, &quot;Bullitproof&quot;, reached No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart – their only appearance on a US chart. Pacifier co-headlined the Kings of Rock Tour with Australian metallers Superheist. Sean Kemp of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; caught their performance at Adelaide&#x27;s Le Rox, and noticed they, &quot;are still bundles of energy and always make sure that each and every person in the venue are getting into the sounds they create.&quot; While his &quot;favourite Pacifier &#x27;pop&#x27; song (according to Jon, this was a Heavy Metal night) a ditty called &#x27;Bulletproof&#x27;.&quot; The group also issued a live album, &quot;Pacifier Live&quot; (November 2003), which had been recorded during their New Zealand tour earlier that year.

In Vancouver in September 2004, they started recording their sixth studio album, with Richardson co-producing. During the sessions the band announced they would change their name back to Shihad, &quot;The events surrounding the name change and our choice to be known as Pacifier are well documented. As much as we believed in what we were doing, and the reasons for doing it at the time – the truth is we were wrong.&quot; In August 2005 Toogood expanded on why they had returned to Shihad:
The band&#x27;s former name, Pacifier, was raffled off by the Australian radio station Triple J&#x27;s Jay and the Doctor and was claimed by a little known band from Tasmania, Theory of Everything.

=== &quot;Love Is the New Hate&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Machine&quot; and &quot;Ignite&quot; (2005–2011) ===

Shihad released &quot;Love Is the New Hate&quot; in May 2005, with the related tour beginning with a free concert in Auckland&#x27;s Aotea Square and comprised an extensive tour of Australia and New Zealand. In July they took to the main stage at Byron Bay&#x27;s Splendour in the Grass, in front of an audience of 20,000. &quot;Love Is the New Hate&quot; reached No. 2 in New Zealand and No. 11 in Australia. It provided five singles but only &quot;Alive&quot; (January 2005) had any chart success, which peaked at No. 5 in New Zealand and top 40 in Australia. The band also toured with Cog, the Datsuns, and opened for Evanescence on part of their 2006 to 2007 world tour.

During February and March 2008 the band completed their One Will Hear The Other Tour, along Australia&#x27;s east coast, playing 30 shows. &quot;One Will Hear the Other&quot; (January 2008) was released ahead of their seventh studio album, &quot;Beautiful Machine&quot; (April 2008), co-produced by the group with Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Killers, Billy Corgan) and Scott Horscroft (the Sleepy Jackson, the Presets, the Panics) at Melbourne&#x27;s Sing Sing Studios. In the second half of the year they toured New Zealand on the Beautiful Machine Tour promoting the album, which reached No. 1 in New Zealand and No 11 in Australia. For the tour they played medium-sized venues including Wellington Town Hall, with support from the Mint Chicks and Luger Boa. Shihad also toured with Gyroscope around Australia for that group&#x27;s Australia Tour during that year. For New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008/2009 the band performed in Gisborne, followed by shows later in January at the Coroglen Tavern and the Lake Hāwea Motor Inn.

Shihad supported AC/DC for the New Zealand leg of that group&#x27;s Black Ice World Tour in January and February 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;PR AC/DC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January Shihad&#x27;s new single &quot;Cold Heart&quot; was released, and was followed by &quot;Sleepeater&quot; (April) and &quot;Lead or Follow&quot; (July). &quot;Sleepeater&quot; is the only one to reach the local top 50. The singles appeared ahead of their eighth studio album, &quot;Ignite&quot; (24 September 2010) via Roadrunner Records/WEA, which was produced by the group. It debuted at number one in New Zealand, their fourth number-one studio album, and eventually achieved a gold certification. In Australia it peaked in the top 50. The band toured New Zealand in August 2010 performing their earlier albums &quot;Killjoy&quot; and &quot;The General Electric&quot; in full.

At the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards Shihad won the Legacy Award and were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. The group released a compilation album, &quot;The Meanest Hits&quot;, in October 2011, in two formats: a 20-track standard edition and a deluxe 38-track, two-disc edition. The standard version peaked in the top 10 in New Zealand. Also in October the band re-released their 1990 EP &quot;Devolve&quot;, for the first time in digital form on iTunes, and their entire singles and B-sides back catalogue, also on iTunes. On the second disc of the Australian version of &quot;The Meanest Hits&quot;, &quot;Down Dance&quot; was replaced with &quot;Right Outta Nowhere&quot;, which does not appear on the New Zealand version.

=== &quot;FVEY&quot; and 30th anniversary (2012–2020) ===
For the production of their ninth studio album, Shihad worked with Jaz Coleman, of English post-punk band Killing Joke. Coleman produced Shihad&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Churn&quot;, but a disagreement with the band occurred after the release of the album. Following a 15-year period in which Coleman and Shihad did not communicate, Coleman made amends with the band members at a London, UK awards ceremony. Toogood explained in June 2014:
Three years ago we were at the Metal Hammer awards. I hadn&#x27;t talked to Jaz for ages. We&#x27;d had a falling out, I just didn&#x27;t have time for him. Tom [Larkin] went and chatted to him and was like, &quot;come over and talk to him&quot;. I was like, &quot;Fuck that guy&quot;. But he was softer—he doesn&#x27;t drink alcohol anymore. He&#x27;s still gnarly and idealistic and brutal but minus the alcohol that makes him this focused machine. It was just the perfect meeting of what we wanted to do and having the right guy to do it with.

Prior to the recording process, Coleman informed the band, &quot;I&#x27;m going to work you until you&#x27;ve made a great record&quot;. Toogood explained that the entirety of the ninth album was recorded live-in-the-studio, while Coleman conducted, and the band members were forced to focus entirely on each song as they were recorded, without outside distractions, such as mobile phones. After a two-month recording period, Toogood referred to their time with Coleman as a &quot;bootcamp&quot; and explained that they &quot;needed someone to crack the whip&quot; and he felt &quot;purged&quot; afterwards, &quot;It&#x27;s great to hang around guys you&#x27;ve been hanging around with since you were 18.&quot;

&quot;FVEY&quot;, the band&#x27;s ninth album was released on 8 August 2014 via Warner Music New Zealand, and Toogood referred to &quot;FVEY&quot; as Shihad&#x27;s best album in 15 years. It is their fifth number-one album, and they share the honour for most number-one records for any New Zealand artist with Hayley Westenra. As from August 2014 the group had the most Top 40 New Zealand chart singles for any local artist, with 25.

The first single, &quot;Think You&#x27;re So Free&quot;, which was described by Double J&#x27;s writer as sounding &quot;more furious now than they ever have.&quot; Its music video was published on YouTube on 5 July 2014. Prior to the release of the album, Toogood explained that anger towards social injustice was a primary motivation during the songwriting process, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any answers but just as a concerned citizen, I&#x27;m going, &#x27;This is bullshit&#x27;. The music&#x27;s how we feel about that. It&#x27;s fucking frustrating.&quot; Musically, the band chose a heavier sound, signifying a return to the first album, which the band found most enjoyable to play during their greatest hits tour. Shihad were featured on a new version of Jimmy Barnes&#x27; track, &quot;Love and Hate&quot;, for the artist&#x27;s album, &quot;30:30 Hindsight&quot; (August 2014).

Shihad performed their second album, &quot;Killjoy&quot;, to support its re-release as a remastered version at The Powerhouse, Auckland in May 2015. Together with Carl Cox they co-headlined the 2015 Rhythm &amp; Alps festival at Cardrona Valley, Wānaka on New Years Eve. The band celebrated their 30th anniversary with tours in New Zealand and Australia during 2018. &quot;Ambient Light&quot;″s Tim Gruar attended their show in October at The Waterfront&#x27;s Shed 6, Wellington, and felt, &quot;[they] have come from a thrash metal beginning but as they&#x27;ve grown they&#x27;ve become more and more tuneful, bringing us really great anthems along the way. And we heard those tonight.&quot; Chris Familton of &quot;Doubtful Sounds&quot; caught their set at Sydney&#x27;s The Metro Theatre in late November, which &quot;began with &#x27;Think You&#x27;re So Free&#x27; from their most recent album &quot;FVEY&quot; and worked its way back, in chronological order to &#x27;Factory&#x27; from their debut &quot;Churn&quot;.

In November 2020 Shihad signed with UNIFIED, the announcement coincided with the release of the group&#x27;s cover version of Split Enz&#x27;s &quot;I Got You&quot;, the lead single from a tribute album by various artists, &quot;True Colours, New Colours: The Songs of Split Enz&quot;, due in February 2021.

=== &quot;Old Gods&quot; (2021–2024) ===
Throughout the first months of 2021 the band have been regularly updating Facebook with the progress of their 10th studio album, which is being produced by Birds of Tokyo&#x27;s Adam Spark. &quot;Tear Down Those Names&quot; was released to streaming services, the lead single to the band&#x27;s tenth studio album, entitled &quot;Old Gods&quot;.

== Side projects ==

Shihad&#x27;s members have pursued side projects or solo work. Larkin had established his own recording studio in Melbourne in 2008 as The Studio&#x27;s in the City, which became Homesurgery Recordings in 2018. With fellow producers he worked on material by the Getaway Plan, Northeast Party House, and High Tension. Larkin recalled working with Karina Utomo of High Tension, &quot;[who] found the concept of a standing in front of a microphone, headphones on, singing directly into it a disconnected and awkward&quot; so he cleared the room like a stage, &quot;giving her a simple handheld vocal mic and standing back as she cut loose, punching the walls, dropping to her knees screaming and delivering vocal takes that were brutal, unrepeatable and amazing to behold.&quot;

Toogood has collaborated with New Zealand artists, outside his work with Shihad, since 2009. He worked with Shayne Carter (Dimmer), Julia Deans (Fur Patrol), Ladi6, Anika Moa, Ruban and Kody Neilson (the Mint Chicks), and Tiki Taane. In the following year they formed the Adults as a rock supergroup, which released a self-titled album in June 2011. He has undertaken solo performances from 2015. Knight created a podcast series, &quot;What&#x27;s Phil Worried About Today?&quot; He started the podcast series to help other people after he had experienced acute anxiety disorder and associated alcohol addiction. His alcohol addiction had affected his early years with Shihad, &quot;I had a problem with drinking and playing back then also. Stopping that was a big positive shift in my performing.&quot;

<text>The Media Center, branded by Western Digital, is a 7,200-rpm hard drive (either 160GB or 250GB), combined with a reader of CompactFlash Type I and II, Microdrive, Memory Stick, Memory Stick Pro, MultiMediaCard, Secure Digital, and SmartMedia media. It can use either FireWire or USB to interface with a personal computer (Farrance, 2004).

Although branded as a Media Center this product is not a traditional media center and is nothing but a storage device and cannot actually play any media to a TV or Monitor. It must be plugged into a computer using the appropriate software to play any media.

==Current products ==

The product is now called WD TV, and supports Netflix, Pandora, and other services. The upgraded version, the WD TV Hub Live, supports Mediafly, Pandora, YouTube, Blockbuster, and Netflix. It comes with a 1 terabyte internal hard drive and can sync media using a &quot;watched folders&quot; paradigm from either a Mac or a PC. It does not support wi-fi natively, but this can be remedied by purchasing an adapter.

Seagate, Viewsonic and Iomega have similar media hard drives that can be plugged into a TV. They generally support Netflix, but few other services. The Roku has a USB port on one of its models, which can be used with an external hard drive.

The WD TV Hub Live does syncing, which makes it a DLNA-compliant media extender, as well as a hard drive and streaming device. The WD Live doesn&#x27;t have this feature.

<doc id="430134" wikidata="Q130251" url="?curid=430134" title="Bantu expansion">
<text>The Bantu expansion was a major series of migrations of the original Proto-Bantu-speaking group, which spread from an original nucleus around West-Central Africa. In the process, the Proto-Bantu-speaking settlers displaced, eliminated or absorbed pre-existing hunter-gatherer and pastoralist groups that they encountered.

There is linguistic evidence for this expansion – a great many of the languages which are spoken across sub-Equatorial Africa are remarkably similar to each other, suggesting a recent common cultural origin of their original speakers. The linguistic core of the Bantu languages, which comprise a branch of the Atlantic-Congo language family, was located in the southern regions of Cameroon. Genetic evidence also indicates that there was a large human migration from central Africa, with varying levels of admixture with local population.

The expansion is believed to have taken place in at least two waves, between about 4,000 and 2,000 years ago (approximately 2,000 BC to AD 1). Linguistic analysis suggests that the expansion proceeded in two directions: the first went across or along the Northern border of the Congo forest region (towards East Africa), and the second – and possibly others – went south along Africa&#x27;s Atlantic coast into what is now the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola, or inland along the many south-to-north flowing rivers of the Congo River system. The expansion reached South Africa, probably as early as AD 300.

==Theories on expansion==
Bantuists believe that the Bantu expansion most probably began on the highlands between Cameroon and Nigeria. The 60,000-km2 Mambilla region straddling the borderlands here has been identified as containing remnants of &quot;the Bantu who stayed home&quot; as the bulk of Bantu-speakers moved away from the region. Archaeological evidence from the separate works of Jean Hurault (1979, 1986 and 1988) and Rigobert Tueché (2000) in the region indicates cultural continuity from 3000 BC until today. The majority of the groups of the Bamenda highlands (occupied for 2000 years until today), somewhat south and contiguous with the Mambilla region, have an ancient history of descent from the north in the direction of the Mambilla region.

Initially, archaeologists believed that they could find archaeological similarities in the region&#x27;s ancient cultures that the Bantu-speakers were held to have traversed. Linguists, classifying the languages and creating a genealogical table of relationships, believed they could reconstruct material culture elements. They believed that the expansion was caused by the development of agriculture, the making of ceramics, and the use of iron, which permitted new ecological zones to be exploited. In 1966, Roland Oliver published an article presenting these correlations as a reasonable hypothesis.

The hypothesized Bantu expansion pushed out or assimilated the hunter-forager proto-Khoisan, who had formerly inhabited Southern Africa. In Eastern and Southern Africa, Bantu speakers may have adopted livestock husbandry from other unrelated Cushitic-and Nilotic-speaking peoples they encountered. Herding practices reached the far south several centuries before Bantu-speaking migrants did. Archaeological, linguistic, genetic, and environmental evidence all support the conclusion that the Bantu expansion was a significant human migration. Generally, the movements of Bantu language-speaking peoples from the Cameroon/Nigeria border region throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa radically reshaped the genetic structure of the continent and led to extensive admixture between migrants and local populations. A 2023 genetic study of 1,487 Bantu speakers sampled from 143 populations across 14 African countries revealed that the expansion occurred ~4,000 years ago in Western Africa. The results showed that Bantu speakers received significant gene-flow from local groups in regions they expanded into.

Based on dental evidence, Irish (2016) concluded that the common ancestors of West African and Proto-Bantu peoples may have originated in the western region of the Sahara, amid the Kiffian period at Gobero, and may have migrated southward, from the Sahara into various parts of West Africa (e.g., Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo), as a result of desertification of the Green Sahara in 7000 BC. From Nigeria and Cameroon, agricultural Proto-Bantu peoples began to migrate, and amid migration, diverged into East Bantu peoples (e.g., Democratic Republic of Congo) and West Bantu peoples (e.g., Congo, Gabon) between 2500 BC and 1200 BC. He suggests that Igbo people and Yoruba people may have admixture from back-migrated Bantu peoples.

==Atlantic–Congo languages==

The Atlantic-Congo family comprises a huge group of languages spread throughout Western, Central and Southern Africa. The Benue–Congo branch includes the Bantu languages, which are found throughout Central, Southern, and Eastern Africa.

A characteristic feature of most Atlantic–Congo languages, including almost all the Bantu languages except Swahili, Sotho-Tswana and Nguni languages, is their use of tone. They generally lack case inflection, but grammatical gender is characteristic, with some languages having two dozen genders (noun classes). The root of the verb tends to remain unchanged, with either particles or auxiliary verbs expressing tenses and moods. For example, in a number of languages the infinitival is the auxiliary designating the future.

==Pre-expansion-era demography==
Before the expansion of Bantu-speaking farmers, Central, Southern, and Southeast Africa were likely populated by Pygmy foragers, Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers, Nilo-Saharan-speaking herders, and Cushitic-speaking pastoralists.

===Central Africa===
It is thought that Central African Pygmies and Bantus branched out from a common ancestral population c. 70,000 years ago. Many Batwa groups speak Bantu languages; however, a considerable portion of their vocabulary is not Bantu in origin. Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with honey collecting, or is otherwise specialised for the forest and is shared between western Batwa groups. It has been proposed that this is the remnant of an independent western Batwa (Mbenga or &quot;Baaka&quot;) language.

===Southern Africa===
Before the Bantu expansion, Khoisan-speaking peoples inhabited Southern Africa. Their descendants have largely mixed with other peoples and adopted other languages. A few still live by foraging, often supplemented by working for neighbouring farmers in the arid regions around the Kalahari desert, while a larger number of Nama continue their traditional subsistence by raising livestock in Namibia and adjacent South Africa.

===Southeast Africa===
Prior to the arrival of Bantus in Southeast Africa, Cushitic-speaking peoples had migrated into the region from the Ethiopian Highlands and other more northerly areas. The first waves consisted of Southern Cushitic speakers, who settled around Lake Turkana and parts of Tanzania beginning around 5,000 years ago. Many centuries later, around AD 1000, some Eastern Cushitic speakers also settled in northern and coastal Kenya.

Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers also inhabited Southeast Africa before the Bantu expansion.

Nilo-Saharan-speaking herder populations comprised a third group of the area&#x27;s pre-Bantu expansion inhabitants.

==History and development==
===Expansion===
Linguistic, archeological and genetic evidence indicates that during the course of the Bantu expansion, &quot;independent waves of migration of western African and East African Bantu-speakers into southern Africa occurred.&quot; In some places, genetic evidence suggests that Bantu language expansion was largely a result of substantial population replacement. In other places, Bantu language expansion, like many other languages, has been documented with population genetic evidence to have occurred by means other than complete or predominant population replacement (e.g. via language shift and admixture of incoming and existing populations). For example, one study found this to be the case in Bantu language speakers who are African Pygmies or are in Mozambique, while another population genetic study found this to be the case in the Bantu language-speaking Lemba of Southern Africa. Where Bantu was adopted via language shift of existing populations, prior African languages were spoken, probably from African language families that are now lost, except as substrate influences of local Bantu languages (such as click sounds in local Bantu languages).

====c. 3000BC to c. AD 500====
It seems likely that the expansion of the Bantu-speaking people from their core region in West Africa began around 4000–3500BC. Although early models posited that the early speakers were both iron-using and agricultural, definitive archaeological evidence that they used iron does not appear until as late as 400BC, though they were agricultural. The western branch, not necessarily linguistically distinct, according to Christopher Ehret, followed the coast and the major rivers of the Congo system southward, reaching central Angola by around 500BC.

It is clear that there were human populations in the region at the time of the expansion, and pygmies are their closest living relatives. However, mtDNA genetic research from Cabinda suggests that only haplogroups that originated in West Africa are found there today, and the distinctive L0 of the pre-Bantu population is missing, suggesting that there was a complete population replacement. In South Africa, however, a more complex intermixing could have taken place.

Further east, Bantu-speaking communities had reached the great Central African rainforest, and by 500BC, pioneering groups had emerged into the savannas to the south, in what are now the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Zambia.

Another stream of migration, having moved east by 3,000 years ago (1000BC), was creating a major new population center near the Great Lakes of East Africa, where a rich environment supported a dense population. The Urewe culture dominated the Great Lakes region between 650BC and 550BC. It was one of Africa&#x27;s oldest iron-smelting centres. By the first century BC, Bantu speaking communities in the great lakes region developed iron forging techniques that enabled them to produce carbon steel.

Movements by small groups to the southeast from the Great Lakes region were more rapid, with initial settlements widely dispersed near the coast and near rivers, due to comparatively difficult farming conditions in areas farther from water. Archaeological findings have shown that by 100 BC to 300 AD, Bantu speaking communities were present at the coastal areas of Misasa in Tanzania and Kwale in Kenya. These communities also integrated and intermarried with the communities already present at the coast. Between 300 AD-1000 AD, through participation in the long-existing Indian Ocean trade route, these communities established links with Arabian and Indian traders, leading to the development of the Swahili culture. Other pioneering groups had reached modern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa by AD 300 along the coast, and the modern Limpopo Province (formerly Northern Transvaal) by AD 500.

====From the 11th century to 17th century====
Between the 11th and 16th centuries, powerful Bantu-speaking states on a scale larger than local chiefdoms began to emerge. Notable early kingdoms include the Kingdom of the Kongo in present-day Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom in the Great Lakes region, the Kingdom of Mapungubwe (c.1075–c.1220) in present-day South Africa, and the Zambezi River, where the Monomatapa kings built the Great Zimbabwe complex. The Swahili city-states were also established early in this period. These include sultanates based at Lamu, Mombasa, Kilwa, Pate and Malindi. The Swahili traded with the inland kingdoms, including Great Zimbabwe. Such processes of state-formation occurred with increasing frequency from the 16th century onward. They likely resulted from denser population, which led to more specialised divisions of labour, including military power, while making outmigration more effortful. Other factors promoting state-formation were increased trade among African communities and with European and Arab traders on the coasts, technological innovations in economic activity, and new techniques in the political-spiritual ritualisation of royalty as the source of national strength and health. Other inland centres established during this phase of expansion include Bigo bya Mugenyi in Uganda, Thimlich Ohinga in Kenya and the Kweneng&#x27; Ruins in South Africa.

==Criticism==

Manfred K. H. Eggert stated that &quot;the current archaeological record in the Central African rainforest is extremely spotty and consequently far from convincing so as to be taken as a reflection of a steady influx of Bantu speakers into the forest, let alone movement on a larger scale.&quot;

Seidensticker (2024) indicates that the prevalent paradigm for the Bantu expansion has a forced connection between Central African ceramics and Central African languages, where the geographic location of speakers of the Bantu languages are treated as synonymous with the geographic location of ceramic remnants; the popular approach of attempting to correlate linguistic reconstructions with archaeological data has resulted in propagation of the faulty presumption and circular reasoning that the earliest ceramic manufacturing in a given area is evidence for the earliest presence of Bantu-speakers. Within the fierce debate among linguists about the word &quot;Bantu&quot;, Seidensticker (2024) indicates that there has been a &quot;profound conceptual trend in which a &quot;purely technical [term] without any non-linguistic connotations was transformed into a designation referring indiscriminately to language, culture, society, and race&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Cable Public Affairs Channel (), better known by its acronym CPAC ( ), is a Canadian specialty television channel owned by a consortium consisting of Rogers Communications, Vidéotron, Cogeco, Eastlink, and Access Communications. The channel is devoted to coverage of public and government affairs, including carrying a full, uninterrupted feed of proceedings of the House of Commons of Canada, with three audio channels, one untreated feed and, with the assistance of interpreters, one in each of the official languages.

==Synopsis==
CPAC&#x27;s main purpose is the broadcast of proceedings of the House of Commons. Other programming includes meetings of The House of Commons and Senate of Canada parliamentary committees, occasional Supreme Court proceedings, political conventions, conferences, committees and coverage of general elections. CPAC also airs the proceedings of certain Royal Commissions and judicial enquiries.

CPAC is similar to services in other countries including C-SPAN (United States), EuroparlTV (European Union), La Chaîne parlementaire (France), Phoenix (Germany), BBC Parliament (United Kingdom), Arutz HaKnesset (Israel) and TV Câmara and TV Senado (Brazil), some of which (particularly C-SPAN) occasionally supply programming to CPAC.

==History==
Television broadcasting of the proceedings of the House of Commons began in 1977 after a motion approving it was adopted by the House, with broadcasts commencing in October of that year. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) allowed cable companies to carry the broadcasts on their specialty channels as an interim measure. In 1979, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was given a temporary network licence to begin live coverage of the proceedings (which had been airing on a tape delayed basis until then), leading to the creation of the CBC Parliamentary Television Network. A permanent licence was granted to the CBC the next year.
In 1989, the CBC and a consortium of cable television providers made a joint proposal for the creation of a new entity, the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPaC) that would carry the proceedings of the House of Commons and committees, along with proceedings of royal commissions, enquiries, court hearings and provincial legislatures, and public affairs programming. A review of parliamentary broadcasting resulted but the CPaC proposal was not acted upon.

In December 1990, the CBC announced that as a result of budget cuts the CBC &quot;is no longer able to bear the cost of operating the English- and French-language parliamentary channels. The government will seek the views of the Speaker of the House and consider means of maintaining the service.&quot; The CBC announced that it was discontinuing its role as the parliamentary broadcaster effective April 1, 1991. As an interim measure, the House of Commons&#x27; Board of Internal Economy negotiated a temporary contract with the CBC to provide parliamentary coverage for an additional year while the Board considered proposals to take over the service. In 1992, the Board came to an agreement with Canadian Parliamentary Channel, Inc., a consortium of 25 cable companies, to take over the CBC&#x27;s role; the new service received its licence from the CRTC in 1993.
While the Canadian Parliamentary Channel&#x27;s name was soon changed to Cable Public Affairs Channel to reflect the greater diversity of programming and the cable industry&#x27;s ownership of the service, the ownership structure continues today. The shareholders of Cable Public Affairs Channel Inc. are cable companies Rogers Communications (66.75%), Vidéotron (21.81%), Cogeco (6.73%), Eastlink (3.77%), and Access Communications (0.92%), with a small stake held by technology company Vecima Networks (0.02%).

To date there have been few, if any, accusations of influence by these cable companies on CPAC&#x27;s editorial policy. Indeed, some CPAC promotions (featuring Tom Green) have claimed that because it is owned by the cable industry, &quot;not the government&quot;, it is more independent than other broadcasters, such as the national public broadcaster CBC, which also provide extensive political coverage through various outlets.

During federal election campaigns, the network frequently airs &quot;Campaign Politics&quot;, a documentary series in which each episode profiles one individual electoral district through interviews with candidates and voters.

===Choice of feeds===

In 2003, at the behest of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), CPAC and its carriers started to allow television viewers to choose which language they can hear the service in, putting the feed of one language on the service&#x27;s main audio channel and the feed of the other language on its second audio program channel. Some cable systems also offer the two feeds on separate channels for easier access. CPAC has also offered a &quot;floor&quot; feed, a feed that does not carry any simultaneous translation, although due to the changes noted above, it may not remain in use over cable or satellite television. A choice between all three feeds are offered on CPAC&#x27;s free Internet video stream available on the channel&#x27;s website.

===Senate proceedings===
Proceedings of the Senate were historically not carried as the upper house had not agreed to allow its sessions to be televised. Then, on 25 April 2006, Senator Hugh Segal moved that the proceedings of the Senate be televised. The motion was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament for consideration; although the motion was approved, broadcast of senate proceedings was not launched at that time apart from selected committee meetings. Full broadcast of Senate proceedings launched for the first time on 18 March 2019, concurrently with the Senate&#x27;s temporary relocation to the Government Conference Centre.

===Non-political programming===
From February 12 to 28, 2010, CPAC simulcasted the V network&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. V (since renamed Noovo) does not have wide availability outside Quebec, unlike previous rightsholder Radio-Canada or even rival private network TVA. This had caused some concern with francophone groups outside Quebec, thus, CPAC was chosen because of its mandatory carriage on the basic service of all cable and satellite providers, as well as the fact that the House of Commons was not sitting during the games. Although CPAC&#x27;s conditions of licence do not normally permit the channel to air sports, it received special authorization from the CRTC to permit this simulcast.

Since 2009, CPAC has also had the authority to carry entertainment programming on July 1 in order to cover Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill or elsewhere.

<doc id="430140" wikidata="Q311153" url="?curid=430140" title="Muhammad al-Baqir">
<text>Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (; ) was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the fifth of the twelve Shia imams, succeeding his father, Ali al-Sajjad, and succeeded by his son, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. Muhammad&#x27;s honorific title is short for , which means &#x27;the one who splits knowledge open&#x27;, a reference to his fame as a religious scholar.

Muhammad was born in Medina around 676 CE. In 680, when he was a small child, he witnessed the Battle of Karbala, where his grandfather Husayn ibn Ali and most of his relatives were massacred by the forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya (). Upon his father&#x27;s death around 712, Muhammad was recognized as the next imam by most followers of his father. These were the Imamites, the forerunners of Twelvers and Isma&#x27;ilis, which now constitute the majority of Shia Muslims. At the time, however, this quiescent group was a minority compared to other rival Shia groups, who actively worked against the Umayyads. One such rival group were Zaydis. These followed Zayd ibn Ali, a much younger half-brother of al-Baqir, who staged an unsuccessful revolt shortly after al-Baqir&#x27;s death. In contrast, like his father, al-Baqir was politically quiescent but was nevertheless harassed by the Umayyads, especially by Caliph Hisham ().

Muhammad al-Baqir led a pious and scholarly life in Medina, attracting a growing number of followers, students, and visitors. He is credited with laying the doctrinal and legal foundations of Twelver Shi&#x27;ism during some twenty years of his imamate. He may also be regarded as the father of Isma&#x27;ili and Zaydi jurisprudence. Finally, he significantly contributed to Twelver exegesis of the Quran. Most of al-Baqir&#x27;s disciples were based in Kufa, in present-day Iraq, many of whom later became outstanding Shia jurists and traditionists. Some of these, such as Zurara ibn A&#x27;yan, may have occasionally disagreed with al-Baqir, who disapproved of such independent views if they went beyond the general theological and legal framework provided by (Shia) imams. In Sunni Islam, al-Baqir is regarded as an authority in law and prophetic tradition, but portrayed as anti-Shia and proto-Sunni. 

Muhammad al-Baqir died around 732, poisoned by the Umayyads, according to most Shia reports. He is buried in the Baqi Cemetery in Medina, but the shrine that stood over his grave has been demolished twice by Wahhabis. Al-Baqir was succeeded by his eldest son, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, who further developed Shia theology and law.

== Ancestry ==

Muhammad al-Baqir was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, through both of his grandsons, namely, Hasan and Husayn, who were the second and third of the twelve Shia imams, respectively. More specifically, al-Baqir&#x27;s father was Husayn&#x27;s son, Ali al-Sajjad, the fourth of the twelve imams. Muhammad&#x27;s mother was Fatima Umm Abd Allah, while his maternal grandfather was Hasan.

Hasan and Husayn were the eldest sons of the first Shia imam, Ali ibn Abi Talib, through his first wife, Fatima, daughter of the Islamic prophet.

==Titles==

Muhammad&#x27;s is Abu Ja&#x27;far, and his honorific title is , short for , which means either &#x27;the one who splits knowledge open&#x27; (brings it to light) or &#x27;the one who possesses great knowledge&#x27;, both of which are references to Muhammad&#x27;s fame as a religious scholar. 

By some accounts, Muhammad was already known in his lifetime by the title . Shia sources posit that this title was designated by the Islamic prophet, who sent his greetings via his companion Jabir ibn Abd Allah, who lived long enough to meet al-Baqir in his childhood. According to another Shia account, Caliph Hisham, a contemporary of al-Baqir, contemptuously referred to him as (), which again suggests that he was known by this title in his lifetime. The occasion was the caliph&#x27;s meeting with al-Baqir&#x27;s half brother, Zayd ibn Ali, who reprimanded Hisham and attributed al-Baqir&#x27;s title to the Islamic prophet.

==Biography==

Muhammad al-Baqir was born in Medina in about 676 CE (56 AH). Twelver Shias annually celebrate this occasion on the third of Safar. In 680, when Muhammad was a small child, his grandfather Husayn and most of his male relatives were massacred in the Battle of Karbala by forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid. Muhammad was present in Karbala and witnessed the carnage. Muhammad&#x27;s youth coincided with power struggles between the Umayyads, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, and various Shia groups, while Muhammad&#x27;s father, al-Sajjad, stayed aloof from politics. When al-Sajjad died around 712, most of his followers accepted the imamate of his son Muhammad, who was about thirty-seven years old. He lived a quiet pious life in Medina, like his father, but was nevertheless harassed by the Umayyads, especially by Caliph Hisham. Muhammad, however, enjoyed certain liberties because the Umayyads were more lenient in this period, or perhaps because they were busy infighting and quelling revolts. During the next twenty years or so, Muhammad al-Baqir thus expounded Shia doctrines and laws, attracting a growing number of followers, students, and visitors.

=== Abd al-Malik () ===

The fifth Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, is credited with issuing an Islamic gold coinage for the first time to replace Byzantine coins. This was likely done at the suggestion of al-Baqir.

=== Umar II () ===

Often praised for his piety, the Umayyad caliph Umar II was favorably disposed to al-Baqir. After meeting with him, the caliph apparently returned the disputed lands of Fadak to Alids, that is, descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib. In a Sunni tradition, likely circulated by anti-Alids, al-Baqir identifies Umar II as the Mahdi, the promised savior in Islam. In a Shia tradition, however, al-Baqir suggests that Umar&#x27;s good deeds would not redeem him, for he had usurped the imam&#x27;s right to rule.

=== Hisham () ===

Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik summoned al-Baqir to the Umayyad capital Damascus several times and imprisoned him at least once. During these visits, the caliph apparently held theological debates in which al-Baqir emerged victorious. On one occasion, the caliph ordered al-Baqir to join an ongoing archery practice, probably hoping to embarrass him, but was astonished by al-Baqir&#x27;s excellent marksmanship.

===Death===
Although 732 (114 AH) and 735 (117 AH) are commonly reported, there is considerable disagreement about when al-Baqir died, ranging from 732 to 736. He was about fifty-seven years old at the time, and most likely died before Zayd&#x27;s revolt in 740. Twelvers annually commemorate his death on the seventh of Dhu al-Hijja. 

As with the rest of the twelve imams, Shia sources report that al-Baqir was killed. There is no consensus about the details, and different sources accuse Hisham or his successor, al-Walid II (), of poisoning al-Baqir. According to another account, al-Baqir was poisoned by his cousin, Zayd ibn al-Hasan, once the latter failed to wrest control of the Islamic prophet&#x27;s inheritance from al-Baqir. 

Al-Baqir is buried in the Al-Baqi Cemetery in Medina. A shrine stood over his grave until its demolition in 1806 and then again around 1925, both times carried out by Wahhabis.

==Imamate==

After al-Sajjad, most of his followers accepted the imamate of his eldest son Muhammad. These were the Imamites, who were the forerunners of Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili Shias. Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili sources indeed report that al-Sajjad had earlier designated al-Baqir as his successor. Followers of al-Baqir, however, were in minority compared to the rival Kaysanites, which was a (now-extinct) Shia group that traced the imamate through Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Khawla bint Ja&#x27;far, a woman from the Banu Hanifa tribe. Nevertheless, al-Baqir had an advantage over these non-Fatimid claimants because of his prestigious lineage from Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatima, the only surviving daughter of the Islamic prophet.

=== Zayd ibn Ali ===
Another claimant to leadership was Zayd ibn Ali, a much younger half-brother of al-Baqir. It is not certain, however, if Zayd was a rival for al-Baqir. Despite their disagreements, relationship between the two brothers is described as cordial. The quiescent al-Baqir even attempted to dissuade the politically active Zayd from rebellion. In 740, not long after al-Baqir&#x27;s death, Zayd took up arms against the Umayyads but was defeated and killed by Caliph Hisham. 

Zayd&#x27;s activism initially gained him a larger following than al-Baqir, especially because the former accommodated some of the majority views. For instance, even though Zayd regarded Ali ibn Abi Talib more qualified to succeed the Islamic prophet, he refused to condemn the first two caliphs, namely, Abu Bakr and Umar. Such views, however, cost Zayd part of his Shia support, most of whom condemn Abu Bakr and Umar as usurpers of Ali&#x27;s right to the caliphate. Those Shia Muslims who thus rejected Zayd joined al-Baqir or his son Ja&#x27;far. Zayd&#x27;s rebellion marks the beginning of the Zaydi movement, a Shia subsect that has survived to present day in Yemen. Muhammad al-Baqir also challenged al-Hasan al-Muthanna and two of his sons for controlling the prophet&#x27;s inheritance and for claiming to be the Mahdi.

=== Politics ===
Like his father, al-Baqir was politically quiescent, to the point that some have suggested that he did not claim the imamate. Indeed, al-Baqir&#x27;s notion of imamate was based primarily on knowledge rather than political power, although he also considered Shia imams entitled to the latter. Al-Baqir instead focused on religious teaching, attracting a growing number of visitors, students, and followers. He is often credited with laying the foundations of Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili doctrines and law. Among key Shia doctrines that took their definitive form under al-Baqir are imamate, sacred alliance () and separation (), and religious dissimulation (). As for law, al-Baqir is often regarded as the founding father of Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili jurisprudence. In particular, al-Baqir&#x27;s imamate marks the transition of the Shia community to completely rely on their own imams in matters of law and rituals. As for religious dues, al-Baqir accepted gifts but did not collect (), another Islamic alms which was likely enforced by later imams.

=== Ghulat ===

Several traditions of al-Baqir are against the Ghulat (). These often conferred divinity on Shia imams or had other extreme beliefs, such as anthropomorphism and metempsychosis. For instance, al-Baqir condemned Mughira ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Bajali, who said that the imam was divine. Mughira has also been accused of falsifying al-Baqir&#x27;s traditions. Similarly, al-Baqir denounced Bayan ibn Sam&#x27;an, who apparently claimed to be a prophet.

===Miracles===
Some miracles are attributed to al-Baqir in Shia sources. He is reported to have conversed with animals, returned sight to a blind, and foretold future events, such Zayd&#x27;s death in battle, collapse of the Umayyads, and the accession of the Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur ().

===Succession===

When al-Baqir died, most of his followers accepted the imamate of his eldest son Ja&#x27;far, aged about thirty-seven at the time. Ja&#x27;far is often known by the honorific (). On multiple occasions, al-Baqir seems to have told his followers about his preference for Ja&#x27;far.
Apparently some did not accept al-Baqir&#x27;s death and awaited his return as the Mahdi. After al-Baqir&#x27;s death, some Ghulat figures claimed to have inherited extraordinary powers from him, including Bayan ibn Sam&#x27;an and Abu Mansur al-Ijli.

==Appearance and character==

The Shia scholar Ibn Shahrashub () describes al-Baqir as medium height, with delicate skin and slightly curly hair. He adds that al-Baqir had birthmarks, one on his cheek, and that he had a beautiful voice and a slender waist. By contrast, al-Mufid (), another Shia scholar, describes al-Baqir as a &quot;well-built man,&quot; as translated by the Islamicist I.K.A. Howard, or &quot;big-bodied,&quot; as translated by M. Pierce, another Islamicist. Such differences may reflect the changing social standards over centuries. Muhammad al-Baqir is said to have been extremely generous, pious, and peaceful by nature. 

According to some Shia accounts, al-Baqir did not spare himself and his family from wearing good clothes and eating delicious food, and this behavior attracted attention at a time when the tendencies of giving up the world were widespread. He used to work in the field to earn a living on par with his servants, and the motivation for this work, he said, was obedience to God and not needing people. According to a narration by Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, al-Baqir had less income but more expenses compared to other family members. He treated his relatives with good food and gave them good clothes. He also helped his servants in difficult tasks. According to Ibn Asakir and Ibn Qutaybah, although he was saddened by his son&#x27;s illness, he did not mourn his death, because he considered this to be an act of opposition to God.

== Contributions==

In his lifetime, al-Baqir was regarded as a prominent transmitter of prophetic traditions. As a Shia imam, al-Baqir&#x27;s own sayings and deeds have also been recorded in Shia sources, including some fifteen percent of the traditions collected in the celebrated . Such is the extent of his contributions that Shia traditions attributed to al-Baqir and his successor al-Sadiq outnumber all other Shia imams and the prophet combined.
As the first Shia imam who engaged in systematic teaching, al-Baqir is also credited with laying the doctrinal and legal foundations of Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, which were further developed by al-Sadiq. Contributions of al-Baqir to Twelver doctrine and law are collected in the six-volume , compiled by A. al-Utaridi. Al-Baqir may also be regarded as the father of Isma&#x27;ili and Zaydi jurisprudence. Finally, al-Baqir significantly contributed to Twelver exegesis of the Quran and two commentaries are attributed to him. 

===Contributions to theology===
==== Imamate====
Al-Baqir&#x27;s doctrine of imamate, further elaborated by his successor al-Sadiq, characterized the necessary qualities of imams, particularly their divinely-inspired designation (), their esoteric knowledge (), and their infallibility (), all of which distinguished imams as the best of mankind, representatives of God on earth, and the only source of spiritual guidance. In particular, after Muhammad, they are the only authoritative interpreters of the Quran, the exalted part of which actually refers to them and Muhammad. In contrast, as the executer of religious laws, imamate or caliphate is essentially a political function in Sunni Islam, where caliphs are ideally appointed by consensus, although hereditary caliphate is the norm.

In al-Baqir&#x27;s view, imamate is confined to descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, from the marriage of his daughter Fatima to his cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib. Following a divine mandate, each imam is designated by his predecessor (), beginning with Ali himself who was designated by the prophet at the Ghadir Khumm. For instance, al-Baqir cited the Quranic verse 2:124, according to which, God designated Abraham as imam and also granted this favor to those of his progeny who are not evildoers. Crucially, the hereditary nature of imamate in al-Baqir&#x27;s doctrine closed the field to outside claimants. is often accompanied in Shia sources by inheritance of secret religious scrolls and the prophet&#x27;s weapons. The latter paralleled the Ark of the Covenant for the Israelites.

In al-Baqir&#x27;s doctrine, imams are distinguished by their esoteric knowledge, which they inherited from Ali. In turn, Ali received this knowledge from the prophet, a reference to the well-known prophetic tradition, &quot;I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate.&quot; In particular, imams know the true exegesis () of the Quran, a reference to the famous hadith of the, attributed to the prophet. Al-Baqir&#x27;s doctrine of imamate was thus primarily based on knowledge rather than political power, although he also considered imams entitled to the latter. The divinely-inspired knowledge of imams and prophets are similar but imams could only hear (and not see) the archangels, according to al-Baqir.

According to al-Baqir, imams also inherit certain spiritual and primordial lights () referenced in the Quran.Their divine knowledge and spiritual light protect imams from sins, for which al-Baqir cited the verse of purification. Already in his lifetime, some followers of al-Baqir regarded him as infallible. 

By implication, al-Baqir&#x27;s doctrine gave imams absolute spiritual authority over Muslims, resting on the absolute authority of the prophet. His doctrine also held imams as the sole spiritual guides in life and the source of intercession in the afterlife. In al-Baqir&#x27;s view, imams are the highest proofs ( ) of God and guides towards Him, without whom the world cannot exist for a moment. Not only obedience to imams is obligatory in al-Baqir&#x27;s interpretation of the verse of obedience, but love for them is also mandated in his exegesis of the verse of. Shias thus form an all-encompassing bond of spiritual loyalty () with their imams, who are both masters and supportive friends in the journey of the spirit. Identifying his imam is a religious duty for every Muslim, and those who die without knowing their imam have died a death of ignorance (Jahilliya). Furthermore, willfull opposition to imams is a grave sin and staunch enemies of imams are destined for hellfire.

To support his theory, al-Baqir relied on his interpretations of various Quranic verses and prophetic traditions. For instance, al-Baqir emphasized his interpretation of the verse of, according to which Ali was granted the guardianship () of Muslims, on par with the prophet. According to al-Baqir, fearing backlash from some, the prophet was reluctant to publicly announce the of Ali until he was spurred to do so (at the Ghadir Khumm) by the verse of tabligh. The prophetic traditions that al-Baqir invoked include the hadith of the Ghadir Khumm and the hadith of the position.

====Nature of God ====

A hotly debated issue at the time was whether the Quran, thought to be the word of God, was created or eternal. Those who believed in predetermination argued that the Quran was eternal for God has always known the events referenced in the Quran. In contrast, those who advocated for free will thought that the Quran was created in time. Al-Baqir held that the Quran was neither created nor eternal. Rather, it is the word of the Creator. 

More generally, al-Baqir held that all attributes of God were eternal but only as adjectives. For instance, &quot;knowing&quot;, &quot;hearing&quot;, and &quot;seeing&quot; are how God characterizes himself. These help believers understand something about God but are not to be confused with Him. In al-Baqir&#x27;s view, God is beyond human imagination. He thus advised his followers to discuss God&#x27;s creation rather than his nature. When asked if he has seen God, al-Baqir responded that God could not be seen by eyes but can be apprehended by the inner reality of faith. On another controversial topic, al-Baqir held that God was a thing, but a thing incomparable to all other things, something neither cognisable nor delimited.

====Faith ()====

By definition, a () and a Muslim are characterized, respectively, by the two notions of () and (). Citing the Quranic verse 49:14, al-Baqir defined Muslims as those who confess Islam in words and outwardly practice Islamic rites, such as praying and fasting. In his view, however, is more exclusive than , that is, the former implies the latter but not vice versa. More specifically, al-Baqir held that is a Muslim with inner faith, a faith demonstrated through fulfillment of religious duties. The foremost among these duties is the to (Shia) imams. There are indeed numerous traditions attributed to al-Baqir about , the importance of which, in his view, is such that one&#x27;s good deeds would not be accepted without . Yet al-Baqir also curtailed this absolutist perspective by emphasizing that cannot be attained without virtue and piety.
In addition to , al-Baqir listed the remaining duties of a as (), prayer, fasting, pilgrimage (Hajj), and (striving in God&#x27;s way). He also listed (), (), (), and () as the pillars of .

Al-Baqir thus identified an intermediate state between and (disbelief). This gray area was further characterized by his successor al-Sadiq, who held that a Muslim who does not harbor enmity towards the Ahl al-Bayt and their followers is neither nor (disbeliever). That is, such non-Shias are considered Muslims, with their due legal rights, but not (true) believers.

By implication, al-Baqir considered righteous action as an integral component of , a view that sharply differed from Murji&#x27;ites and Kharijites, two contemporary currents. The former did not consider good conduct essential to , with the political implication that dissent and disobedience were discouraged, even if Muslim rulers were corrupt. For Kharijites, in contrast, anyone who committed a mortal sin automatically apostated.

In al-Baqir&#x27;s view, had degrees of perfection and could vary over time. In particular, he held that new (religious) knowledge, when put into action, would strengthen one&#x27;s . Later Sunni thought similarly adopted the notion of gradated .

====Predestination====

Under Umayyads, predestination, the belief that God has pre-ordained everything, was likely promoted to justify their rule and encourage moral complacency. In contrast, there were others who believed in free will. Among this latter group, some held that all that is good is created by God and everything bad is from men. Al-Baqir rejected both views, saying that there was a third position between predestination and free will. He argued that God is too merciful to force his creatures to sin and then punish them and that He is too mighty to will a thing that would not transpire. In words of his successor al-Sadiq, God predestined some things but left others to man. 

Closely related is the early doctrine of , that is, advancement or postponement of an act of creation, depending on circumstances, without any change to the overall design and intention of God. The doctrine of thus describes an intermediate position between predestination and free will: God&#x27;s decision on some matters remain suspended, according to al-Baqir, subject to advancement and postponement, until the autonomous choice of His creatures has occurred. Only then His definite decision is made. In turn, is closely tied to the concept of abrogation () of some verses of the Quran.

====Religious dissimulation ()====

Muhammad al-Baqir is often credited with formulating the Shia doctrine of , that is, precautionary dissimulation to avoid persecution. was intended for the survival of Shia imams and their followers, for Shias were molested in al-Baqir&#x27;s time to the point that he thought that it was easier to be a nonbeliever (). Traditions attributed to al-Baqir thus encourage his followers to hide their faith for their safety, some even characterizing as a pillar of faith. For instance, al-Baqir is not known to have publicly reviled Abu Bakr and Umar, most likely because he exercised . Indeed, al-Baqir&#x27;s conviction that the Islamic prophet had explicitly designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor implies that Abu Bakr and Umar lacked legitimacy. Al-Baqir&#x27;s quiescent views sharply differed from Mu&#x27;tazilites, who held that enjoining good and forbidding wrong should be enforced by force, if necessary. 

The notion of was not unfamiliar to early Muslims. When Ammar, an early companion of the Islamic prophet, renounced his faith under torture, Muhammad is said to have approved his conduct. The Quranic verse 16:106 is often connected to this episode. Other Quranic verses suggest that Abraham and Joseph both practice dissimulation, the former when he said he was ill and the latter when his brother was accused of theft. 

====Religious dissociation ()====

Al-Baqir also taught the doctrine of , that is, dissociation from the first three caliphs and the majority of the prophet&#x27;s companions as enemies of Shia imams. Indeed, Imamites regard the early caliphs as usurpers of Ali&#x27;s right to succeed the prophet.

=== Contributions to jurisprudence===

Al-Baqir founded what later developed into the Twelver school of law and consolidated some characteristic practices of the Shia. For instance, in the call to daily prayer (), al-Baqir added the expression (), an expression that was removed by Umar, according to Shia and some early Sunni sources. Al-Baqir also defended () marriage, saying that it was a practice sanctioned by the Islamic prophet, but later abandoned by Umar. In these rulings, al-Baqir thus sided with Ali ibn Abi Talib and Ibn Abbas, two influential figures in early Islam. Another distinct ruling of al-Baqir was that wiping one&#x27;s footwear before prayer, though common at the time, was unacceptable as a substitute for washing one&#x27;s feet. 
Al-Baqir also forbade all intoxicants, whereas Kufan jurists of his time permitted fermented drinks (). He also maintained that, under threat of death or injury, self-protection through dissimulation () is obligatory. Finally, is an extant treatise on the rituals of , attributed to al-Baqir and narrated by his disciple Abu al-Jurad Ziyad ibn Mundhir.

Shia imams expected their disciples to seek (and then follow) their advice about new legal questions, or else answer those questions by applying limited reasoning within the general framework provided by imams. Al-Baqir is indeed known to have rebuked those who went beyond this framework, including Muhammad ibn al-Hakim and Muhammad al-Tayyar. In particular, al-Baqir discouraged his followers from (individual reasoning) or applying () and (). He considered these methods speculative and lacking in religious authority, which, in his view, was limited to Shia imams as the only authoritative interpretors of the Quran and the prophetic tradition ().

=== Contributions to Quranic exegesis ===

Muhammad al-Baqir is credited with the Quranic exegesis  (), narrated by his disciple Ibn al-Mundhir. Parts of this work have survived in , written by the Twelver scholar al-Qummi (). This commentary is ranked first by the Twelver bibliographer al-Najashi () among early Quranic commentaries. Similarly, is a collection of exegetical traditions, ascribed to al-Baqir and narrated by his disciple Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju&#x27;fi. In , an extensive Twelver exegesis of the Quran, al-Baqir is the authority for thirteen percent of its traditions, behind only the prophet and al-Sadiq.

== Notable disciples ==

Muhammad al-Baqir may have been the first Shia imam who systematically taught Shia beliefs. Even though he lived in Medina, the main following of al-Baqir was in Kufa, where he attracted a number of distinguished theologians. Basra, Mecca, and Syria were other places where al-Baqir&#x27;s students were based. More than four hundred and sixty names are listed as students of al-Baqir in al-Rijal, a Twelver work on biographical evaluation authored by al-Kashahi ().

=== Kufa ===
Al-Baqir had several distinguished disciples in Kufa, where Jabir al-Ju&#x27;fi was his main representative. Jabir is the authority for some traditions in , which parallels &quot;Infancy Gospel of Thomas&quot; in gnostic Christology. In its &quot;Apocalypse of Jabir,&quot; al-Baqir confides to Jabir how the cosmos were created, how men descended to this world, and how they can gain deliverance from it. Some have accused Jabir of extremism () and his reliability is debated in Shia circles. is said to contain Jabir&#x27;s views about Isma&#x27;ilism.

Zurara ibn A&#x27;yan was already a prominent traditionist and theologian before joining al-Baqir&#x27;s circle. Zurara apparently disagreed with al-Baqir about some theological issues. For instance, unlike al-Baqir, Zurara argued that there is no intermediate state between a believer and a nonbeliever. By some accounts, Zurara later fell out with al-Sadiq, but perhaps the imam distanced himself from Zurara only in public to save the latter from persecution.

Aban ibn Taghlib was another associate of al-Baqir and later of al-Sadiq. An outstanding jurist, Aban was authorized by al-Baqir to issue legal rulings for the public. Despite his Shia tendencies, Aban&#x27;s traditions have been cited in Sunni sources.
Abu Basir al-Asadi is among the consensus companions of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, that is, those whose traditions are generally accepted in Shia circles. Muhammad ibn Muslim, another close associate of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, was a prominent jurist and traditionist, who is said to have transmitted some thirty thousand traditions from al-Baqir. Fudayl ibn Yasar was another favorite of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, whom the latter apparently compared to Salman al-Farsi, the famous companion of the Islamic prophet. Abu al-Qasim al-Ijli and Abu Basir al-Muradi, both notable jurists and traditionists, were associates of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq. Abu Hamza al-Thumali and Abu Khalid al-Kabuli, were two followers of al-Baqir and earlier of al-Sajjad. In particular, some traditions narrated by Abu Hamza are of miraculous nature.

Al-Kumayt ibn Zayd al-Asadi was a poet supporter of al-Baqir, praised by him for laudatory poems about the Ahl al-Bayt. Kumayt&#x27;s , in praise of the Ahl al-Bayt, is indeed considered among the earliest evidence for the doctrine of imamate, and perhaps the earliest dateable reference to the Ghadir Khumm. Likely to avoid persecution, Kumayt also occasionally wrote in praise of the Umayyads. 
Mu&#x27;min al-Taq was another follower of al-Baqir, who wrote and debated about imamate. Ibn Mundhir was a close disciple of al-Baqir and the principal transmitter of He later supported Zayd&#x27;s rebellion and founded the Jarudiyya, the Zaydi sect closest in doctrine to Twelver Shi&#x27;ism.

=== Elsewhere ===

Basra was not a Shia center, but al-Baqir had a few notable disciples there, including Muhammad ibn Marwan al-Basri, Isma&#x27;il ibn Fadl al-Hashemi, Malek ibn A&#x27;yan al-Juhani. In Mecca, al-Baqir&#x27;s circle included Ma&#x27;ruf ibn Kharbuz Makki and Maymun ibn al-Aswad al-Qaddah. The latter was likely a merchant and in charge of al-Baqir&#x27;s property in Mecca. One of Maymun&#x27;s sons, Abdullah, is the alleged ancestor of Isma&#x27;ili imams. Elsewhere, prominent followers of al-Baqir included Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il Bazi and other members of Bazi&#x27;s family, Abu Harun and his namesake, Abu Harun Makfuf, and also Uqba ibn Bashir al-Asadi, Aslam al-Makki, and Najiyy ibn Abi Mu&#x27;adh ibn Muslim.

==Views==

===Sunni view===

Muhammad al-Baqir is regarded as a reliable () traditionist in Sunni Islam, distinct in that he accepted only those prophetic traditions that had been reported by his predecessors. Among those scholars who drew from al-Baqir&#x27;s traditions are al-Shafi&#x27;i () and Ibn Hanbal (), the eponymous founders of the Hanbali and Shafi&#x27;i schools of law, respectively, and the famed Sunni historian al-Tabari (). In particular, al-Baqir is the authority for over a hundred traditions in the six canonical collections of Sunni hadith. However, some have criticized al-Baqir for directly quoting individuals who had died before him.

Despite al-Baqir&#x27;s reputation as a reliable traditionist, he is rarely cited in Sunni collections of hadith, compared to their Shia counterparts. This might be because Sunni traditionists &quot;picked and chose&quot; from traditions attributed to al-Baqir, or perhaps because they intentionally discarded the numerous Shia-colored traditions attributed to him. Those traditions of al-Baqir that do appear in Sunni collections have different chains of transmission compared to their Shia counterparts. These Sunni traditions portray al-Baqir as a proto-Sunni scholar who denounced Shias and their beliefs. For instance, unlike Shia sources, later Sunni authors maintain that al-Baqir supported Abu Bakr and Umar, called them imams, and said that one should pray behind Umayyads.

In Sunni Islam, al-Baqir is also regarded as an authority in jurisprudence. For instance, Abu Hanifa (), the eponym of the Hanafi school of law, Ibn Jurayj (), and Awza&#x27;i () deferred to al-Baqir in legal matters.

The Sunni attitude towards al-Baqir is reflected in the following reports. The exegesis attributed to al-Baqir tops the list of Quranic works compiled by the Sunni bibliographer Ibn al-Nadim (). Abd Allah ibn Ata al-Makki thought that other scholars felt humbled in al-Baqir&#x27;s presence. According to the Sunni traditionist Muhammad ibn Munkadir (), al-Baqir was the only scholar who surpassed his father, al-Sajjad. Sunni sources also describe Abu Hanifa as a prominent disciple of al-Baqir, even saying that the latter prophesied that the former would revive the .

===Twelver and Isma&#x27;ili view===

Muhammad al-Baqir is an imam for Twelvers and Isma&#x27;ilis, who constitute the overwhelming majority of Shia Muslims. For them, after the prophet, Shia imams are regarded as the sole source of religious guidance, fostering an all-encompassing bond of loyalty () with their Shias. Al-Baqir is also regarded as a founding authority in Shia jurisprudence, and a significant contributor to Shia theology. Al-Baqir is considered here as the foremost religious authority of his time, unlike Sunnism. His status is such that a tradition with interrupted or broken chain of transmission would be deemed reliable when narrated by him.

===Zaydi view===

Muhammad al-Baqir is a prominent figure in Zaydism. His traditions appear in some Zaydi works, and he has heavily influenced Zaydi jurisprudence. However, the quiescent al-Baqir is generally not recognized as an imam in Zaydism, for Zaydi imams are required to be politically active. 
In Zaydi works, al-Baqir acknowledges Zayd&#x27;s superior knowledge and implicitly Zayd&#x27;s claims to the imamate.

===Sufi view===

Muhammad al-Baqir is regarded as a founding figure in Sufism, where he is noted for his asceticism and piety. In Sufism, al-Baqir is portrayed as an authority in esoteric sciences and the hidden dimensions of the Quran, and a gnostic who performed miracles (). It is related that al-Baqir defined Sufism as &quot;goodness of disposition: He that has the better disposition is the better Sufi.&quot;

==Family==

Muhammad al-Baqir was married to Umm Farwa, who bore him two sons. One of them was Ja&#x27;far, who later succeeded al-Baqir. Umm Hakim, daughter of Usayd al-Thaqafi, was al-Baqir&#x27;s other wife, from whom two more sons were born, although both died in childhood. Al-Baqir had three more sons, all of whom were born to a concubine. According to the Shia genealogist Alawi al-Umari, al-Baqir&#x27;s lineage has continued only through Ja&#x27;far.

<doc id="430144" wikidata="Q191966" url="?curid=430144" title="Gene Wilder">
<text>Gene Wilder (born Jerome Silberman; June 11, 1933 – August 29, 2016) was an American actor, comedian, writer and filmmaker. He was mainly known for his comedic roles, including his portrayal of Willy Wonka in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971). He collaborated with Mel Brooks on the films &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967), &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974) and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), and with Richard Pryor in the films &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980), &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; (1989) and &quot;Another You&quot; (1991).

He began his career on stage, and made his screen debut in an episode of the TV series &quot;The Play of the Week&quot; in 1961. His first film role was that of a hostage in the 1967 motion picture &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. His first major film role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1967 film &quot;The Producers&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It was the first in a series of collaborations with writer/director Mel Brooks, including &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, which Wilder co-wrote, garnering the pair an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. He also starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; (1972).

Wilder directed and wrote several of his own films, including &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; (1984). With his third wife, Gilda Radner, he starred in three films, the last two of which he also directed. Her 1989 death from ovarian cancer led to his active involvement in promoting cancer awareness and treatment, helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co-founding Gilda&#x27;s Club. After his last acting performance in 2003—a guest role on &quot;Will &amp; Grace,&quot; for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series—Wilder turned his attention to writing. He produced a memoir, &quot;Kiss Me Like a Stranger&quot; (2005) and five other books.

==Early life and education==
Wilder was born Jerome Silberman on June 11, 1933, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to a Russian Jewish family. He was the son of Jeanne (Baer) and William J. Silberman, a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items. Wilder first became interested in acting at age eight, when his mother was diagnosed with rheumatic fever and the doctor told him to &quot;try and make her laugh.&quot;

At the age of 11, he saw his sister, who was studying acting, performing onstage, and the experience enthralled him. He asked her teacher if he could become his student, and the teacher said that if he was still interested at age 13, he would take Wilder on as a student. The day after Wilder turned 13, he called the teacher, who accepted him; Wilder studied with him for two years.

When Jeanne Silberman felt that her son&#x27;s potential was not being fully realized in Wisconsin, she sent him to Black-Foxe, a military institute in Hollywood, where he was bullied and sexually assaulted, primarily because he was the only Jewish boy in the school, according to his own account. After an unsuccessful short stay at Black-Foxe, Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theater community. He performed for the first time in front of a paying audience at age 15, as Balthasar (Romeo&#x27;s servant) in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Gene Wilder graduated from Washington High School in Milwaukee in 1951.

Wilder was raised Jewish, but he held only the Golden Rule as his philosophy. In a book published in 2005, he stated, &quot;I have no other religion. I feel very Jewish and I feel very grateful to be Jewish. But I don&#x27;t believe in God or anything to do with the Jewish religion.&quot;

Wilder studied Communication and Theatre Arts at the University of Iowa, where he was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. Following his 1955 graduation from Iowa, he was accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, England. After six months of studying fencing, Wilder became the first freshman to win the All-School Fencing Championship. Desiring to study Stanislavski&#x27;s system, he returned to the US, living with his sister and her family in Queens, New York City. He enrolled at the HB Studio.

==Military service==
Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10, 1956. At the end of recruit training, he was assigned to the medical corps and sent to Fort Sam Houston for training. He was then given the opportunity to choose any open post; wanting to stay near New York City to attend acting classes at the HB Studio, he chose to serve as paramedic in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Valley Forge Army Hospital, in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. In November 1957, his mother died from ovarian cancer. He was discharged from the army a year later and returned to New York. A scholarship to the HB Studio allowed him to become a full-time student. At first living on unemployment insurance and some savings, he later supported himself with odd jobs such as a limousine driver and fencing instructor.

==Acting career==
===1951–1964: Early work and Broadway debut===
Wilder&#x27;s first professional acting job was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he played the Second Officer in Herbert Berghof&#x27;s production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. He also served as a fencing choreographer. After three years of study with Berghof and Uta Hagen at the HB Studio, Charles Grodin told Wilder about Lee Strasberg&#x27;s method acting. Grodin persuaded him to leave the studio and begin studying with Strasberg in his private class. Several months later, Wilder was accepted into the Actors Studio. Feeling that &quot;Jerry Silberman in &quot;Macbeth&quot;&quot; did not have the right ring to it, he adopted a stage name. He chose &quot;Wilder&quot; because it reminded him of &quot;Our Town&quot; author Thornton Wilder, while &quot;Gene&quot; came from the character Eugene Gant in Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;. He also liked &quot;Gene&quot; because as a boy, he was impressed by a distant relative, a World War II bomber navigator who was &quot;handsome and looked great in his leather flight jacket&quot;. He later said that he could not see Gene Wilder playing &quot;Macbeth&quot;, either.

After joining the Actors Studio, he slowly began to be noticed in the off-Broadway scene, thanks to performances in Sir Arnold Wesker&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; and in Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Complaisant Lover&quot;, for which Wilder received the Clarence Derwent Award for &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Nonfeatured Role&quot;. One of Wilder&#x27;s early stage credits was playing the socially awkward mental patient Billy Bibbit in the original 1963–64 Broadway adaptation of Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; opposite star Kirk Douglas.

===1967–1974: Collaborations with Mel Brooks ===
In 1963, Wilder was cast in a leading role in &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;, a production starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks. A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theater productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1967&#x27;s &quot;The Producers&quot;.

&quot;The Producers&quot; eventually became a cult comedy classic, with Mel Brooks winning an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Wilder being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Nevertheless, Brooks&#x27; first directorial effort did not do well at the box office and was not well received by all critics; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Renata Adler reviewed the film and described it as &quot;black college humor&quot;.

In 1969, Wilder relocated to Paris, accepting a leading role in Bud Yorkin&#x27;s &quot;Start the Revolution Without Me&quot;, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for &quot;Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx&quot; and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced &quot;The Producers&quot;. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but he would not be able to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.

In 1971, Wilder auditioned to play Willy Wonka in Mel Stuart&#x27;s film adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. After reciting some lines, director Mel Stuart immediately offered him the role. Before Wilder was officially cast for the role, Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody, and Jon Pertwee were all considered. Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl&#x27;s original choice to play Willy Wonka. Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role.

The film was not a big success on its opening weekend, although it received positive reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert, who compared it to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The film currently holds a 92% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the critical consensus stating &quot;&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don&#x27;t always work but express the film&#x27;s uniqueness.&quot;

The three films Wilder appeared in following &quot;The Producers&quot; were box office failures: &quot;Start the Revolution&quot; and &quot;Quackser&quot; seemed to audiences poor copies of Mel Brooks films, while &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; was not a commercial success, although it later gained a cult following and an Oscar nomination for Best Score, as well as a Golden Globe award nomination for Wilder.

When Woody Allen offered him a role in one segment of &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;, Wilder accepted, hoping this would be the hit to put an end to his series of flops. &quot;Everything ... &quot; was a hit, grossing over $18 million in the United States alone against a $2-million budget.

After &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;, Wilder began working on a script he called &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. After he wrote a two-page scenario, he called Mel Brooks, who told him that it seemed like a &quot;cute&quot; idea, but showed little interest. A few months later, Wilder received a call from his agent, Mike Medavoy, who asked if he had anything where he could include Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman, his two new clients. Having just seen Feldman on television, Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station, where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time. The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim. Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks, asking him to direct. Brooks was not convinced, but having spent four years working on two box-office failures, he decided to accept. While working on the &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; script, Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the musical film adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s classic book, &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. When filming was about to begin in London, Wilder received an urgent call from Brooks, who was filming &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, offering Wilder the role of the &quot;Waco Kid&quot; after Dan Dailey dropped out at the last minute, while Gig Young became too ill to continue. Wilder shot his scenes for &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; and immediately afterwards filmed &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

After &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; was written, the rights were to be sold to Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, Wilder, Brooks, and producer Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five-year contracts. &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. While filming &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, Wilder had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes. Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn agreed to participate in the project, and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Smarter Brother&quot;.

===1975–1989: Films with Richard Pryor ===
In 1975, Wilder&#x27;s agent sent him a script for a film called &quot;Super Chief&quot;. Wilder accepted, but told the film&#x27;s producers that he thought the only person who could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood&#x27;s first successful interracial movie comedy duo. While filming &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, Wilder began working on a script for &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Lover&quot;, inspired by Fellini&#x27;s &quot;The White Sheik&quot;. Wilder wrote, produced, and directed &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Lover&quot;, which premièred in 1977, but was a critical failure. &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; (1979) was Wilder&#x27;s next project. The film was to star John Wayne, but he dropped out and was replaced by Harrison Ford, then an up-and-coming actor.

In 1980, Wilder teamed up again with Richard Pryor in &quot;Stir Crazy&quot;, directed by Sidney Poitier. Pryor was struggling with a severe cocaine addiction, and filming became difficult, but once the film premiered, it became an international success. &quot;New York&quot; magazine listed &quot;Skip Donahue&quot; (Wilder) and &quot;Harry Monroe&quot; (Pryor) as number nine on their 2007 list of &quot;The Fifteen Most Dynamic Duos in Pop Culture History&quot;, and the film has often appeared in &quot;best comedy&quot; lists and rankings.

Poitier and Wilder became friends, with the pair working together on a script called &quot;Traces&quot;—which became 1982&#x27;s &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, the film where Wilder met comedian Gilda Radner. Through the remainder of the decade, Wilder and Radner worked on several projects together. After &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, Wilder directed his third film, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;, which starred Wilder, Radner, and Kelly LeBrock. &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; was not well received by the critics, nor was their next project, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;, which failed to attract audiences. &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; did win an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Stevie Wonder&#x27;s song &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot;. TriStar Pictures wanted to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor, and Wilder agreed to do &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; only if he were allowed to rewrite the script. The studio agreed, and &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; premiered in May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder and Pryor, as well as Kevin Spacey&#x27;s performance, but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible. Roger Ebert called it &quot;a real dud&quot;; the &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot; described the film as &quot;stupid&quot;, with an &quot;idiotic script&quot; that had a &quot;contrived story&quot; and too many &quot;juvenile gags&quot;, while Vincent Canby called it &quot;by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder&quot;, also acknowledging that &quot;this is not elegant movie making, and not all of the gags are equally clever&quot;.

===1990–2005: Later years and final roles ===
After starring as a political cartoonist who falls in love in the 1990 film &quot;Funny About Love&quot;, Wilder performed in one final movie with Pryor, the 1991 feature &quot;Another You&quot;, in which Pryor&#x27;s physical deterioration from multiple sclerosis was clearly noticeable. It was Pryor&#x27;s last starring role in a film (he appeared in a few cameos before he died in 2005) and also marked Wilder&#x27;s last appearance in a feature film. His last two movies were not financially successful. Wilder&#x27;s remaining work consisted of television movies and guest appearances in TV shows.

Wilder was inducted into the Wisconsin Performing Arts Hall of Fame, at the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts in Milwaukee, on April 9, 1991.

In 1994, Wilder starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Something Wilder&quot;. The show received poor reviews and lasted only one season. He went back to the small screen in 1999, appearing in three television movies, one of which was the NBC adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The other two, &quot;Murder in a Small Town&quot; and &quot;The Lady in Question&quot;, were mystery movies for A&amp;E TV that were cowritten by Wilder, in which he played a theater director turned amateur detective.

Three years later, Wilder guest-starred on two episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, winning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor on a Comedy Series for his role as Mr. Stein, Will Truman&#x27;s boss. This ended Wilder&#x27;s screen career; from 2003 forward, Wilder focused his creative energies on writing novels and stories, as well as painting.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Wilder met his first wife, Mary Mercier, while studying at the HB Studio in New York. Although the couple had not been together long, they married on July 22, 1960. They spent long periods of time apart, eventually divorcing in 1965. A few months later, Wilder began dating Mary Joan Schutz, a friend of his sister. Schutz had a daughter, Katharine, from a previous marriage. When Katharine started calling Wilder &quot;Dad&quot;, he decided to do what he felt was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;, marrying Schutz on October 27, 1967, and adopting Katharine that same year. Schutz and Wilder separated after seven years of marriage, with Katharine suspecting that Wilder was having an affair with his &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; co-star, Madeline Kahn. After the divorce, he briefly dated his other &quot;Frankenstein&quot; co-star, Teri Garr. Wilder eventually became estranged from Katharine.

Wilder met &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; actress Gilda Radner on August 13, 1981, while filming Sidney Poitier&#x27;s &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;. Radner was married to guitarist G. E. Smith at the time, but she and Wilder became inseparable friends. When the filming of &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; ended, Wilder found himself missing Radner, so he called her. The relationship grew, and Radner eventually divorced Smith in 1982. She moved in with Wilder, and the couple married on September 14, 1984, in the south of France. The couple wanted to have children, but Radner suffered miscarriages, and doctors could not determine the problem. After experiencing severe fatigue and suffering from pain in her upper legs on the set of &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;, Radner sought medical treatment. Following a number of false diagnoses, she was found to have ovarian cancer in October 1986. Over the next year and a half, Radner battled the disease, receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. The disease finally went into remission, giving the couple a respite, during which time Wilder filmed &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot;. By May 1989, the cancer returned and had metastasized. Radner died on May 20, 1989. Wilder later stated, &quot;I always thought she&#x27;d pull through.&quot;

Following Radner&#x27;s death, Wilder became active in promoting cancer awareness and treatment, helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co-founding Gilda&#x27;s Club, a support group to raise awareness of cancer that began in New York City and now has branches throughout the country.

While preparing for his role as a deaf man in &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot;, Wilder met Karen Webb (née Boyer), who was a clinical supervisor for the New York League for the Hard of Hearing. Webb coached him in lip reading. Following Gilda Radner&#x27;s death, Wilder and Webb reconnected, and on September 8, 1991, they married. The two lived in Stamford, Connecticut, in the 1734 Colonial home that he had shared with Radner.

===Semi-retirement===
The Wilders spent most of their time painting watercolors, writing, and participating in charitable efforts.
In 1998, Wilder collaborated on the book &quot;Gilda&#x27;s Disease&quot; with oncologist Steven Piver, sharing personal experiences of Radner&#x27;s struggle with ovarian cancer. Wilder himself was hospitalized with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1999, but confirmed in March 2005 that the cancer was in complete remission following chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant.

In October 2001, he read from &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; as part of a special benefit performance held at the Westport Country Playhouse to aid families affected by the September 11 attacks. Also in 2001, Wilder donated a collection of scripts, correspondences, documents, photographs, and clipped images to the University of Iowa Libraries.

On March 1, 2005, Wilder released his highly personal memoir, &quot;Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art&quot;, an account of his life covering everything from his childhood up to Radner&#x27;s death. Two years later, in March 2007, Wilder released his first novel, &quot;My French Whore&quot;, which is set during World War I. His second novel, &quot;The Woman Who Wouldn&#x27;t&quot;, was released in March 2008.

In a 2008 Turner Classic Movies special, &quot;Role Model: Gene Wilder&quot;, where Alec Baldwin interviewed Wilder about his career, Wilder said that he was basically retired from acting for good. &quot;I don&#x27;t like show business, I realized,&quot; he explained. &quot;I like show, but I don&#x27;t like the business.&quot;

In 2010, Wilder released a collection of stories called &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot; His third novel, &quot;Something to Remember You By: A Perilous Romance&quot;, was released in April 2013.

When asked in a 2013 &quot;Time Out New York&quot; magazine interview whether he would act again if a suitable film project came his way, Wilder responded, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of watching the bombing, shooting, killing, swearing and 3-D. I get 52 movies a year sent to me, and maybe there are three good [ones]. That&#x27;s why I went into writing. It&#x27;s not that I wouldn&#x27;t act again. I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Give me the script. If it&#x27;s something wonderful, I&#x27;ll do it.&#x27; But I don&#x27;t get anything like that.&quot;

In the 2010s, a still from the movie &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; featuring Wilder became a popular Internet meme known as Condescending Wonka.

=== Political views===
In 2007, Wilder stated, &quot;I&#x27;m quietly political. I don&#x27;t like advertising. Giving money to someone or support, but not getting on a bandstand. I don&#x27;t want to run for president in 2008. I will write another book instead.&quot; Wilder donated to Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

==Death and legacy ==
Wilder died on August 29, 2016, at the age of 83, at home in Stamford, Connecticut, from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He had been diagnosed three years before his death but kept knowledge of his condition private. Wilder&#x27;s nephew Jordan Walker-Pearlman said that this was done to not sadden fans of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, stating:

According to his family, Wilder died while listening to one of his favorite songs, a rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; sung by Ella Fitzgerald.

Mel Brooks, as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, spoke about his grief, stating: &quot;He was such a dear friend. I expected that he would go—but when it happens, it&#x27;s still tremendous. It&#x27;s a big shock. I&#x27;m still reeling. No more Gene? ... He was such a wonderful part of my life.&quot;

Various celebrities posted tributes to Wilder on Twitter including Carl Reiner, Albert Brooks, Billy Crystal, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Russell Crowe.

Wilder was included in the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences In Memoriam montage during the 2017 Oscars telecast.

In May 2023, &quot;Remembering Gene Wilder,&quot; a documentary film produced by Julie Nimoy and David Knight, premiered at the Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival.

<doc id="430149" wikidata="Q2107978" url="?curid=430149" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engine was the first high bypass ratio jet engine to power a wide-body airliner. Its initial application was the Boeing 747-100, the original &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot;. It was Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s first high-bypass-ratio turbofan.

==Development==
The JT9D program was launched in September 1965 and the first engine was tested in December 1966.
It received its FAA certification in May 1969 and entered service in January 1970 on the Boeing 747.
It subsequently powered the Boeing 767, Airbus A300 and Airbus A310, and McDonnell Douglas DC-10.
The enhanced JT9D-7R4 was introduced in September 1982 and was approved for 180-minute ETOPS for twinjets in June 1985. By 2020, the JT9D had flown more than 169 million hours.
Production ceased in 1990, to be replaced by the new PW4000.

The JT9D was developed from the STF200/JTF14 demonstrator engines. The JTF14 engine had been proposed for the C-5 Galaxy program but the production contract was awarded to the General Electric TF39. The engine&#x27;s first test run took place in a test rig at East Hartford, Connecticut, with the engine&#x27;s first flight in June 1968 mounted on a Boeing B-52E which served as a JT9D flying testbed.
In 1968, its unit cost was $800,000, $ million today.

==Design==

The JT9D introduced advanced technologies in structures, aerodynamics, and materials, which included titanium alloys and nickel alloys, to improve fuel efficiency and reliability compared to the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D earlier turbofan.
The engine featured a single-stage fan, a three-stage low-pressure compressor, and an eleven-stage high-pressure compressor coupled to a two-stage high-pressure turbine and four-stage low-pressure turbine. The JT9D-3, the earliest certified version of the engine, weighed and produced thrust.

Pratt &amp; Whitney faced difficulties with the JT9D design during the Boeing 747 test program. Engine failures during the flight test program resulted in thirty aircraft being parked outside the factory with concrete blocks hanging from the pylons, awaiting redesigned engines.
Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney worked together in 1969 to solve the problem. The trouble was traced to ovalization, in which stresses during takeoff caused the engine casing to deform into an oval shape resulting in rubbing of high-pressure turbine blade tips. This was solved by strengthening the engine casing and adding yoke-shaped thrust links.

JT9D engines powering USAF Boeing E-4A airborne command posts were designated F105.

==Variants==
All variants have the same number of compressor and turbine stages.


==Applications==
* Airbus A300
* Airbus A310
* Boeing 747-100/200/300/SP
* Boeing 767 (early models)
* Boeing RC-1
* McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40

<text>Leatherman is an American brand of multi-tool made by Leatherman Tool Group of Portland, Oregon. The company was founded in July 1983 by Timothy S. Leatherman and Steve Berliner in order to market the former&#x27;s idea of a capable, easily portable hand tool with multiple functions. That same year, Leatherman Tool Group sold its first Multi-Tool, which was called the PST (Pocket Survival Tool).

==Company history==
Timothy S. Leatherman, a 1970 mechanical engineering graduate of Oregon State University, and his business partner, Steve Berliner, formed Leatherman Tool Group in 1983.

Leatherman was inspired to design a &quot;Boy Scout knife with pliers&quot; while he and his wife traveled Europe and the Middle East in 1975, often attempting to use a simple pocketknife to repair both their aged and repeatedly malfunctioning Italian Fiat 600 car (bought in Amsterdam for $300) and leaky hotel plumbing. He spent several years perfecting the &quot;Mr. Crunch&quot; prototype and received his first U.S. patent (4,238,862) in 1980. After additional refinement, Leatherman&#x27;s first product was introduced in 1983 as the Pocket Survival Tool (PST) and initially sold through Early Winters&#x27; and Cabela&#x27;s mail-order catalogs.

Leatherman sold nearly 30,000 tools in 1984, fueling additional product development, and rapid growth both in the company and manufacturing capacity. By the end of 2001, the company had sales of $100 million annually and had sold more than 20 million tools.

Folding knives were introduced into the Leatherman product line in 2005. In 2007, the company opened its first retail store, located at its manufacturing facility, that has since relocated to a retail store at the Cascade Station shopping center near the facility and Cascades MAX Station in Northeast Portland, Oregon. The same year, Tim Leatherman was inducted into the &quot;Blade&quot; magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame in recognition of his design impact on the cutlery history.

In 2011, the Leatherman Tool Group acquired German light manufacturer, Ledlenser. The brands and companies were run separately, under the Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. umbrella. Leatherman Tool Group also manufactures a line of multi-tools designed specifically for military and law enforcement personnel, as well as accessories for carrying and expanding the function of its tools.
, Leatherman produced 50 products sold in 82 countries, with U.S. market share estimated at 55 percent.

Leatherman has a sponsorship deal with the Major League Soccer team Portland Timbers. Specifically, the company is the shirt sponsor for the team&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Timber Joey&quot;.

==Products==
Leatherman&#x27;s primary products are multi-tools and knives. Most Leatherman multi-tools are built around a pair of pliers, with up to 21 additional tools stored in the handles, including knives (straight and serrated blades), screwdrivers (flat, Phillips), saws, wire cutters and strippers, electrical crimper, bottle opener, and can opener. Most models have a built-in safety mechanism that locks the active tool in the open position when fully unfolded. Models range in weight from the 0.81 ounce (23 g) Style to the 12.5 ounce (335 g) Surge.

Leatherman currently produces folding knives under the Crater name. Models range from two tools (knife blade and carabiner/bottle opener) to four (blade, carabiner/bottle opener, flat, and Phillips screwdrivers).
