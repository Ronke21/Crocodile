<doc id="435813" wikidata="Q4317416" url="?curid=435813" title="Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality">
<text>In probability theory, the Vysochanskij–[[Yuri Petunin|Petunin]] inequality gives a lower bound for the probability that a random variable with finite variance lies within a certain number of standard deviations of the variable&#x27;s mean, or equivalently an upper bound for the probability that it lies further away. The sole restrictions on the distribution are that it be unimodal and have finite variance; here &quot;unimodal&quot; implies that it is a continuous probability distribution except at the mode, which may have a non-zero probability.

== Theorem ==

Let formula_1 be a random variable with unimodal distribution, and formula_2. If we define formula_3 then for any formula_4,

:formula_5

=== Relation to Gauss&#x27;s inequality ===

Taking formula_6 equal to a mode of formula_1 yields the first case of Gauss&#x27;s inequality.

=== Tightness of Bound ===

Without loss of generality, assume formula_8 and formula_9.

* If formula_10, the left-hand side can equal one, so the bound is useless.

* If formula_11, the bound is tight when formula_12 with probability formula_13 and is otherwise distributed uniformly in the interval formula_14.

* If formula_15, the bound is tight when formula_16 with probability formula_17 and is otherwise distributed uniformly in the interval formula_18.

=== Specialization to mean and variance ===

If formula_1 has mean formula_20 and finite, non-zero variance formula_21, then taking formula_22 and formula_23 gives that for any formula_24

:formula_25

=== Proof Sketch ===

For a relatively elementary proof see. The rough idea behind the proof is that there are two cases: one where the mode of formula_1 is close to formula_6 compared to formula_28, in which case we can show formula_29, and one where the mode of formula_1 is far from formula_6 compared to formula_28, in which case we can show formula_33. Combining these two cases gives formula_34 When formula_35, the two cases give the same value.

== Properties ==

The theorem refines Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality by including the factor of 4/9, made possible by the condition that the distribution be unimodal.

It is common, in the construction of control charts and other statistical heuristics, to set , corresponding to an upper probability bound of 4/81= 0.04938..., and to construct &quot;3-sigma&quot; limits to bound &quot;nearly all&quot; (i.e. 95%) of the values of a process output. Without unimodality Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality would give a looser bound of .

== One-sided version ==

An improved version of the Vysochanskij-Petunin inequality for one-sided tail bounds exists. For a unimodal random variable formula_1 with mean formula_37 and variance formula_38, and formula_39, the one-sided Vysochanskij-Petunin inequality (Mercadier and Strobel, 2021) holds as follows:

:formula_40

The one-sided Vysochanskij-Petunin inequality, as well as the related Cantelli inequality, can for instance be relevant in the financial area, in the sense of &quot;how bad can losses get.&quot;

=== Proof ===

The proof is very similar to that of Cantelli&#x27;s inequality. For any formula_41,

:formula_42

Then we can apply the Vysochanskij-Petunin inequality. With formula_43, we have:

:formula_44

As in the proof of Cantelli&#x27;s inequality, it can be shown that the minimum of formula_45 over all formula_41 is achieved at formula_47. Plugging in this value of formula_48 and simplifying yields the desired inequality.

==Generalisation==
Dharmadhikari and Joag-Dev generalised the VP inequality to deviations from an arbitrary point and moments of order formula_49 other than formula_50
:formula_51
where
:formula_52
The standard form of the inequality can be recovered by setting formula_53 which leads to a unique value of formula_54.

<doc id="435828" wikidata="Q2892172" url="?curid=435828" title="Proto-Mongols">
<text>The proto-Mongols emerged from an area that had been inhabited by humans as far back as 45,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. The people there went through the Bronze and Iron Ages, forming tribal alliances, peopling, and coming into conflict with early polities in the Central Plain.

The proto-Mongols formed various tribal kingdoms who fought against one other for supremacy, such as the Rouran Khaganate (330–555) until it was defeated by the Göktürks, who founded the First Turkic Khaganate (552–744), which in turn was subdued by the growing strength of the Tang dynasty. The destruction of the Uyghur Khaganate (744–848) by the Yenisei Kyrgyz resulted in the end of Turkic dominance on the Mongolian Plateau.

The para-Mongol Khitan people founded also referred to by Chineses sources as Liao dynasty (916–1125) and ruled Mongolia and portions of the eastern coast of Siberia now known as the Russian Far East, northern Korea, and North China. Over the next few hundred years, the Jurchens in China subtly encouraged warfare among the Mongols as a way of keeping them distracted from invading China proper.

In the 12th century, Genghis Khan was able to unite or conquer the warring tribes, forging them into a unified fighting force that went on to create the largest contiguous empire in world history, the Mongol Empire, which was finally able to conquer the whole of China proper—beginning with his invasion of the Khitan-led Western Liao dynasty and the Tangut-led Western Xia dynasty, and ending with his grandson Kublai Khan&#x27;s conquest of the Southern Song dynasty. Kublai then founded the Yuan dynasty of China in 1271.

==Origins==
Archaeological evidence suggests that Upper Paleolithic hominins inhabited Mongolia as early as 45,000 years ago.

By the first millennium BC, bronze-working peoples lived on the Mongolia Plateau. With the appearance of iron weapons by the 3rd century BC, the inhabitants of Mongolia had begun to form clan alliances and lived a hunter and herder lifestyle.

The origins of more modern inhabitants are found among the forest hunters and nomadic tribes of Inner Asia. They inhabited a great arc of land extending generally from the Korean Peninsula in the east, across the northern parts of China to present-day Kazakhstan and to the Pamir Mountains and Lake Balkash in the west. During most of recorded history, this has been an area of constant ferment from which emerged numerous migrations and invasions to the southeast (into China), to the southwest (into Transoxiana—modern Uzbekistan, Iran, and India), and to the west (across Scythia toward Europe).

By the eighth century BC, the inhabitants of western Mongolia evidently were nomadic Indo-European speakers, either Scythians or Yuezhi. In central and eastern parts of Mongolia were many other tribes, such as the Slab Grave culture and the Ordos culture.

==Xiongnu==

According to a number of sources, one of the ancestors of the Mongols were the Xiongnu, although it is not yet known whether they were proto-Mongols.

The Xiongnu were a group of nomads who dominated the Asian steppe from the late 3rd century BC for more than 500 years. The Xiongnu invasions prompted the kingdoms of North China to begin erecting what later became the Great Wall.

The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses and some scholars, including A. Luvsandendev, Bernát Munkácsy, Henry Hoyle Howorth, Bolor Erike, Alexey Okladnikov, Peter Simon Pallas, Isaac Jacob Schmidt, Hyacinth and Byambyn Rinchen, insisted on a proto-Mongolian origin. There are several other theories about the ethnolinguistic identity of the Xiongnu, such as Turkic, Yeniseian, Iranian, Uralic, multiethnic.

There are many cultural similarities between the Xiongnu and Mongols such as yurt on cart, mounted use of the composite bow, board game, horn bow and long song. The Mongolian long song is believed to date back at least 2000 years. A mythical origin of the long song is mentioned in the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, volume 113.

==Donghu, Tuoba, and Rouran==

The Donghu (or Tung Hu, the Eastern Hu), a proto-Mongol and/or Tungus group mentioned in Chinese histories as existing as early as the 4th century BC. The language of the Donghu, unlike that of the Xiongnu, is believed by modern scholars to be proto-Mongolic. The Donghu were among the first peoples conquered by the Xiongnu. By the 1st century AD, the Donghu had split, along geographical lines in two: the proto-Mongolic Xianbei in the north and the Wuhuan in the south. After the Xiongnu were driven back into their homeland by the Chinese (48 AD), the Xianbei (in particular) began moving (from apparently the north or northwest) into the region vacated by the Xiongnu.

By the 2nd century AD, the Xianbei had begun attacking Chinese farms south of the Great Wall, established an empire, which, although short-lived, gave rise to numerous tribal states along the Chinese frontier. Among these states was that of the Tuoba, a subgroup of the Xianbei, in modern China&#x27;s Shanxi Province. The Wuhuan also were prominent in the 2nd century, but they disappeared thereafter; possibly they were absorbed in the Xianbei western expansion. The Xianbei and the Wuhuan used mounted archers in warfare, and they had only temporary war leaders instead of hereditary chiefs. Agriculture, rather than full-scale nomadism, was the basis of their economy. In the 6th century, the Wuhuan were driven out of Inner Asia into the Russian steppe.

Chinese control of parts of Inner Asia did not last beyond the opening years of the 2nd century AD, and, as the Eastern Han Dynasty ended early in the 3rd century AD, suzerainty was limited primarily to the Gansu corridor. The Xianbei were able to make forays into a China beset with internal unrest and political disintegration. By 317 all of China north of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) had been overrun by nomadic peoples: the Xianbei from the north; some remnants of the Xiongnu from the northwest; and the Chiang people of Gansu and Tibet (present-day China&#x27;s Xizang Autonomous Region) from the west and the southwest. Chaos prevailed as these groups warred with each other and repulsed the vain efforts of the fragmented Chinese kingdoms south of the Yangtze River to reconquer the region.

By the end of the 4th century, the region between the Yangtze and the Gobi, including much of modern Xinjiang, was dominated by the Tuoba. Emerging as the partially sinicized state of Dai between AD 338 and 376 in the Shanxi area, the Tuoba established control over the region as the Northern Wei Dynasty (AD 386–533). Northern Wei armies drove back the Rouran (referred to as Ruanruan or Juan-Juan by Chinese chroniclers), a newly arising nomadic Mongol people in the steppes north of the Altai Mountains, and reconstructed the Great Wall. During the 4th century also, the Huns left the steppes north of the Aral Sea to invade Europe. By the middle of the 5th century, Northern Wei had penetrated into the Tarim Basin in Inner Asia, as had the Chinese in the 2nd century. As the empire grew, however, Tuoba tribal customs were supplanted by those of the Chinese, an evolution not accepted by all Tuoba.

The Rouran, only temporarily repelled by Northern Wei, had driven the Xiongnu toward the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea and were making raids into China. In the late 5th century, the Rouran established a powerful nomadic empire spreading generally farther north of Northern Wei. It was probably the Rouran who first used the title khan.

==Rise of the Göktürks==
Northern Wei was disintegrating rapidly because of revolts of semi-tribal Tuoba military forces that were opposed to being sinicized, when disaster struck the flourishing Rouran Khaganate. The Göktürks, known as Tujue to Chinese chroniclers, revolted against their Rouran rulers. The uprising began in the Altai Mountains, where many of the Türk were serfs working the iron mines. Thus, from the outset of their revolt, they had the advantage of controlling what had been one of the major bases of Rouran power. Between 546 and 553, the Göktürks overthrew the Rouran and established themselves as the most powerful force in North Asia and Inner Asia. This was the beginning of a pattern of conquest that was to have a significant effect upon Eurasian history for more than 1,000 years. The Göktürks were the first people to use this later widespread name. They are also the earliest Inner Asian people whose language is known, because they left behind inscriptions in a runic-like Orkhon script, which was deciphered in 1896.

It was not long before the tribes in the region north of the Gobi—the Eastern Göktürks—were following invasion routes into China proper used in previous centuries by Xiongnu, Xianbei, Tuoba, and Rouran. Like their predecessors who had inhabited the mountains and the steppes, the attention of the Göktürks quickly was attracted by the wealth of China proper. At first these new raiders encountered little resistance, but toward the end of the 6th century, as China proper slowly began to recover from centuries of disunity, border defenses stiffened. The original Göktürk state split into eastern and western parts, with some of the Eastern Göktürk acknowledging Sui overlordship.

For a brief period at the beginning of the 7th century, a new consolidation of the Göktürks, under the Western Göktürk ruler Tardu, again threatened China proper. In 601 Tardu&#x27;s army besieged Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an), then the capital of the Sui dynasty. Tardu was turned back, however, and, upon his death two years later, the Göktürk state again fragmented. The Eastern Göktürk nonetheless continued their depredations, occasionally threatening Chang&#x27;an.

==Tang Dynasty and the Uyghur Empire==
From 629 to 648, a reunited China proper under the Tang dynasty (618-907) destroyed the power of the Eastern Göktürk north of the Gobi; established suzerainty over the Khitans, a semi-nomadic proto-Mongol people who lived in areas that became the modern Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin; and formed an alliance with the Uyghurs, who inhabited the region between the Altai Mountains and Lake Balkash. Between 641 and 648, the Tang conquered the Western Göktürk, reestablishing Chinese control over Xinjiang and exacting tribute from west of the Pamir Mountains. The Göktürk empire finally ended in 744.

For half a century, the Tang retained control of Central Asia and modern-day Mongolia and parts of Inner Asia. Both sides of the Great Wall came under Tang rule. During this period, the Tang expanded Chinese control into the Oxus Valley. At the same time, their allies, the Uyghurs, conquered much of western and northern Mongolia until, by the middle of the 8th century, the Uyghur seminomadic empire extended from Lake Balkash to Lake Baykal.

Despite these crippling losses, the Tang recovered and, with considerable Uyghur assistance, held their frontiers. Tang dependence upon their northern allies was apparently a source of embarrassment for its rulers, who surreptitiously encouraged the Kirghiz and the Karluks to attack the Uyghurs, driving them south into the Tarim Basin. As a result of the Kirghiz action, the Uyghur empire collapsed in 846. Some of the Uyghurs emigrated to the Turpan Depression, where they established the Kingdom of Qocho that freely submitted to Genghis Khan several centuries later. Ironically, this weakening of the Uyghurs undoubtedly hastened the decline and fall of the Tang Dynasty over the next fifty years.

==Khitan and Jurchen==

Free of Uyghur restraint, the Para-Mongolic Khitan expanded in all directions in the latter half of the 9th century and the early years of the 10th century. By 925 the Khitan ruled eastern Mongolia, most of Manchuria, and the Sixteen Prefectures of northern China. By the middle of the 10th century, Khitan chieftains had declared themselves as Chinese emperors and chose a dynastic name in the Chinese fashion; their rule was known as the Liao dynasty (916–1125).

The period of the 11th and 12th centuries was one of consolidation, preceding the most momentous era in Mongol history, the era of Genghis Khan. During those centuries, the vast region of deserts, mountains, and grazing land was inhabited by people resembling each other in racial, cultural, and linguistic characteristics; ethnologically they were essentially Mongol. The similarities among the Mongols, Göktürk, and Tatars who inhabited this region cause considerable ethnic and historical confusion. Generally, the Mongols and the closely related Tatars inhabited the northern and the eastern areas; the Göktürk (who already had begun to spread over western Asia and Eastern Europe) were in the west and the southwest; the Tangut, who were more closely related to the Tibetans than were the other nomads and who were not a Turkic people, were in eastern Xinjiang, Gansu, and western Inner Mongolia. The Liao state was homogeneous, and the Khitan had begun to lose their nomadic characteristics. The Khitan built cities and exerted dominion over their agricultural subjects as a means of consolidating their empire. To the west and the northwest of Liao were many other Mongol tribes, linked together in various tenuous alliances and groupings, but with little national cohesiveness. In Gansu and eastern Xinjiang, the Tangut—who had taken advantage of the Tang decline—had formed a state, Western Xia (1038–1227), nominally under Song suzerainty. Xinjiang was dominated by the Uyghurs, who were loosely allied with the Song dynasty.

The people of Mongolia at this time were predominantly spirit worshipers, with shamans providing spiritual and religious guidance to the people and tribal leaders. There had been infusion of Buddhism.

A Tungusic people, the Jurchen, ancestors of the Manchu, formed an alliance with the Song and reduced the Liao dynasty to vassal status in a seven-year war (1115–1122). The Jurchen leader proclaimed himself the founder of a new Chinese dynasty, the Jin dynasty. Scarcely pausing in their conquests, the Tungusic Jurchen subdued neighboring Goryeo (Korea) in 1226 and invaded the territory of their former allies, the Song, to precipitate a series of wars with China that continued through the remainder of the century. Meanwhile, the defeated Liao ruler had fled with the small remnant of his army to the Tarim Basin, where he allied himself with the Uyghurs and established the Qara Khitai state (known also as the Western Liao dynasty, 1124–1234), which soon controlled both sides of the Pamir Mountains. The Jurchen turned their attention to the Mongols who, in 1139 and in 1147, warded them off.

==Shiwei and Menggu==

Some Shiwei tribes, though little is known, have been considered the ancestors of the Mongols according to ancient Chinese records. Term &quot;Shiwei&quot; was an umbrella term of the Mongolic and some Tungusic peoples in the 6th to 12th centuries.
During the 5th century, they occupied the area east of the Greater Khingan Range, what is the Hulun Buir, Ergune, Nonni (Noon), Middle Amur, and the Zeya Watersheds. They may have been divided into five to twenty tribes. They were said to be dressed in fish skins. They may have been nomadic, staying in the marshy lowlands in the winter and the mountains during the summer. The burial was by exposure in trees. Their language is described as being similar to Manchu-Tungusic languages and Khitan. The Türk dynasties (550-740) installed tuduns, or governors over the Shiwei and collected tribute. Other Shiwei may have stayed and become the Ewenkis. The Kitans conquered the Shiwei during the late 9th century. One Shiwei tribe, living near the Amur and Ergune rivers, was called the &quot;Menggu&quot; (Mongol). A few scholars believe they, other Shiwei tribes, and many other peoples from the area moved west from the forest to the Mongolian proper steppe.

==States established by proto-Mongols==

<text>Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia (Louise Margaret Alexandra Victoria Agnes; 25 July 1860 – 14 March 1917), later Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn, was a member of the House of Hohenzollern who married into the British royal family. She served as the viceregal consort of Canada while her husband, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, served as the governor general, from 1911 to 1916.

==Early life==
Princess Louise Margaret was born at Marmorpalais (Marble Palace) near Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia. Her father was Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828–1885), the son of Karl of Prussia (1801–1883) and his wife Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1808–1877). Her mother was Princess Maria Anna of Anhalt (1837–1906), daughter of Leopold IV of Anhalt-Dessau. Louise Margaret&#x27;s father, a nephew of William I, German Emperor, distinguished himself as a field commander during the Battle of Metz and the campaigns west of Paris in the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War.

Louise’s parents were estranged because of her father&#x27;s alcoholism and domineering behaviour. Though they were never officially separated, they lived apart. Queen Victoria wrote in a letter that the prince had &quot;behaved so brutally to his wife&quot;.

==Marriage==
On 13 March 1879, Princess Louise Margaret married Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn at St. George&#x27;s Chapel Windsor. Prince Arthur was the seventh child and third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. A 2003 book claims that it was a love match, with the princess also keen to get away from her royal residence in Berlin and from her father&#x27;s bullying.

The wedding was described as grand and the couple received a great number of expensive gifts; the Queen&#x27;s gifts included a diamond tiara and a pearl and diamond pendant. Many members of Britain and Germany&#x27;s royal families attended. Queen Victoria herself was wearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond and a long white veil. After her marriage, Princess Louise was styled &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn&quot;, and her name was Anglicised as Louise Margaret.

The couple had three children: Princess Margaret (1882–1920), Prince Arthur (1883–1938), and Princess Patricia (1886–1974). Princess Margaret married Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and was the grandmother of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. Prince Arthur served as the governor-general of South Africa.

==Duchess of Connaught==

The Duchess of Connaught spent the first twenty years of her marriage accompanying her husband on his various deployments throughout the British Empire. The Duke and Duchess of Connaught acquired Bagshot Park in Surrey as their country home and after 1900 used Clarence House as their London residence. She accompanied her husband to Canada in 1911, when he began his term as governor-general. In 1916, she became colonel-in-chief of the 199th Canadian (Overseas) Infantry Battalion (The Duchess of Connaught&#x27;s Own Irish-Canadian Rangers), CEF after Harry Trihey, the regiment&#x27;s principal organizer and first commanding officer during World War I, secured her as patron. In 1885, she became chief of the 64th (8th Brandenburg) Regiment of Infantry &quot;Field Marshal General Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia&quot;, Prussian Army.

==Death and legacy==
The Duchess of Connaught died of influenza and bronchitis at Clarence House. She became the first member of the British royal family to be cremated. This was done at Golders Green Crematorium. The procedure of burying ashes in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and her urn was transported in an ordinary coffin during the funeral ceremonies. King George V still ordered four weeks of mourning dress and a military guard of honor during the funeral. Her ashes were placed in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle and eventually buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. The Duke of Connaught survived her by almost twenty-five years. 

The Duchess of Connaught&#x27;s net estate in the United Kingdom was valued at £123,008; she left £25,000 to her daughter Princess Margaret and £50,000 to her daughter Princess Patricia of Connaught, noting that £25,000 had already been settled on Princess Margaret upon her marriage. The residuary estate was left to her son Prince Arthur of Connaught.

The maternity hospital adjacent to the Cambridge Military Hospital at Aldershot was named in her honor as the Louise Margaret Maternity Hospital. She laid the foundation stone of this hospital, which was constructed for the wives and children of the Aldershot Garrison.

<doc id="435831" wikidata="Q4818726" url="?curid=435831" title="Milo Radulovich">
<text>Milo John Radulovich (October 28, 1926 – November 19, 2007) was an American reserve Air Force lieutenant who was accused of being a security risk for maintaining a &quot;close and continuing relationship&quot; with his father and sister, in violation of Air Force regulation 35-62 as his family members were accused of Communist sympathies. His case was publicized nationally by Edward Murrow on October 20, 1953, on Murrow&#x27;s program, &quot;See It Now&quot;:


==Biography==
He was born on October 28, 1926, in Detroit, Michigan, of ethnic Serb parentage from Yugoslavia.

In 1953, Radulovich, a lieutenant in the Air Force Reserve in Dexter, Michigan, was discharged because his father and sister were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers. It is believed that the basis of this determination was that his father, a Yugoslav immigrant, kept up on events in his homeland by subscribing to a number of Serbian newspapers. One of these papers was associated with the American Slav Congress, which had been labeled as Communist by the American government. His sister, Margaret Radulovich, was a supporter of liberal causes, but she maintained that she was &quot;apolitical.&quot; Whatever evidence there was against the lieutenant or his family was contained in a manila envelope not shared with Radulovich or his attorney.

Radulovich demanded an Air Force hearing, aided by retired lawyer Charles Lockwood, who worked pro bono. Lockwood contacted an editor at the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, which ran a story about the situation. Among the readers was a former classmate of Radulovich, attorney Kenneth Sanborn (who went on to become a State Representative and Macomb County Circuit Judge in Michigan). He also was an Air Force lieutenant and also accepted no fee for his services. Radulovich was granted a hearing at which the sealed manila envelope was brandished and waved by the attorney for the Air Force. However, the envelope was never opened and neither the board members nor anyone in the Radulovich camp were permitted to see its contents.

The Air Force stripped Radulovich of his commission, which came to the attention of Edward R. Murrow, host of the popular &quot;See It Now&quot; program on CBS. For months, Murrow, producer Fred Friendly and the &quot;See It Now&quot; team had debated how to address Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s witch hunt, until the Radulovich affair. A crew (reporter/assistant producer Joseph Wershba and cameraman Charlie Mack) went to Dexter and filmed impassioned interviews with the lieutenant and his family. Lockwood also appeared, and declared on national television &quot;In my 32 years of practicing ... I have never witnessed such a farce and travesty upon justice as this thing has developed into.&quot;

The program aired on October 20, 1953. The image of the lieutenant and his immigrant father led many viewers to question the impact of McCarthyite tactics for purging the government and military of potential security risks. Radulovich was reinstated one month after the broadcast.

Radulovich moved to California where, despite his reinstatement, he had trouble getting work. He was hired by a private weather forecasting business, later went to work for the National Weather Service, and was chief meteorologist at Capital City Airport in Lansing, Michigan, when he retired in 1994.

Michael Ranville wrote a book about Radulovich&#x27;s trial, &quot;To Strike at a King: The Turning Point in the McCarthy Witch-Hunt.&quot; The CBS broadcast and background to its airing were dramatized in the 1986 made-for-TV movie &quot;Murrow&quot;, and in the 2005 film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;. Mr. Radulovich himself is interviewed in the &quot;special features&quot; segment on the &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; DVD released on March 14, 2006.

After experiencing two strokes and other more minor medical conditions, Radulovich died on November 19, 2007, in Vallejo, California.

==Legacy==
In 2008, The Board of Regents of the University of Michigan approved a posthumous Bachelor of Science degree with a concentration in physics for Radulovich. His case is recognized by the State Bar of Michigan as one of its &quot;Michigan Legal Milestones.&quot;

<text>As a cosmopolitan province, Quebec is a home to various genres of music, ranging from folk to hip hop. Music has played an important role in Quebecer culture. In the 1920s and 1930s, singer/songwriter Madam Bolduc performed comedic songs in a folk style with Irish influences. Quebec&#x27;s popular artists of the last century include Félix Leclerc (1950&#x27;s), Gilles Vigneault (1960s–present), Kate and Anna McGarrigle (1970&#x27;s–present) and Céline Dion (1980&#x27;s–present).&#x27;

The First Nations and the Inuit of Quebec also have their own traditional music. A local variety of Celtic music can also be found there. Quebec also has many well-known jazz musicians and a culture of classical music, as well as a strong presence of historically informed performance of baroque and renaissance music.

The song &quot;À la claire fontaine&quot; was the anthem of the New France, Patriots and French Canadian before being replaced by &quot;O Canada&quot;. Currently, the song &quot;Gens du pays&quot; is preferred by many Quebecers to be the national anthem of Quebec. The Association Québécois de l&#x27;industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo (ADISQ) was created in 1978 to promote the music industry in Quebec. The Orchestre symphonique de Québec and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra are respectively

== Traditional music ==
When it was under French control, Québec was referred to as Le Canada. It was known as the advanced colony out of all the New France settlements. After some generations of French settlers being born in Canada, the colonists began to identify with their home country and call themselves les Canadiens (the Canadians) as distinct from les Français (the French), those native to France. The &quot;Canadiens&quot; brought with them a rich tradition of songs and dances from northern France, namely the regions of Île-de-France, Picardy, Normandy, Poitou, and Brittany. Influence from these regions and the Irish immigration to Quebec of the 19th century may explain the Celtic connection that Quebec still shares with Brittany, Ireland, Scotland and the Maritimes.

As time went by, the French Canadians began to develop their own music, and also incorporated and transformed the styles of music played by the settlers from Great Britain, in particular the Scots, after the Conquest. (One hundred of these songs were collected by Ernest Gagnon for an 1865 compilation, one of the first such collections to be published in Canada.)
Traditional music is infused with many dances, such as the jig, the quadrille, the reel and line dancing, which have developed in the festivities since the early days of colonization. And in Quebec&#x27;s culture, the following musical instruments are the most prominent: harmonica (music-of-mouth or lip-destruction), fiddle, spoons, jaw harp and accordion. Traditional Quebec music is characterized by &quot;podorythmie&quot; which means giving the rhythm with the feet, and is currently provided by various contemporary groups performing mostly during Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations, the Quebec National Holiday and many local festivals.

== Popular music ==

Perhaps the phenomenon in the popular music of that century was the career of La Bolduc, who became extremely popular singing satirical and sometimes racy songs based on the Quebec and Irish folk traditions, and who also was expert in the wordless vocalization known as &quot;turlutte&quot;.

By the 1960s, radio and television had begun to help disseminate French folk songs, especially after the 1967 foundation of the Centennial Collection of Canadian Folk Songs, including recordings of Quebec performers like Yves Albert and Jacques Labrecque, as well as Acadian Edith Butler.

The popular songwriters and singers of this period were Gilles Vigneault, Leonard Cohen (attended McGill University, d.2016, buried in Montreal), and Félix Leclerc, who brought more influences to the music of France-based singing stars like Jacques Brel. Leclerc, from La Tuque, and Vigneault, from Natashquan in the north of Quebec, became heroes for a new generation of Quebec youth. It was Vigneault&#x27;s &quot;Mon pays&quot; (My Country), which became a rallying anthem for Quebec nationalism after a 1965 performance by Monique Leyrac, and established a tradition of Quebec artists supporting Quebec&#x27;s independence movement. Many artists openly endorsed it, notably Raymond Lévesque, Pauline Julien and Paul Piché.

In the 1960s, the French Canadians of Quebec were beginning to self-identify as &quot;Québécois&quot; (Quebecers). See the Quiet Revolution. Another important nationalist performer during this period was Georges Dor, who enjoyed international success with the recording of his own composition, &quot;La complainte de la Manic&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Manicouagan&quot;); other popular singers of the time include Claude Gauthier and Clemence Desrochers. Popular artists of the 70s included Harmonium, Offenbach, Plume Latraverse, Garolou and Beau Dommage, as well as Michel Rivard.

Country music, in both French and English (primarily the former), is prevalent in Quebec. An aspect of the overall Canadian country scene, it is the chief source of francophone country, inclusive of artists such as Renée Martel, Gildor Roy, Patrick Norman, Willie Lamothe, and Georges Hamel.

Progressive rock and fusion jazz band Maneige was founded in Quebec in 1972 by Alain Bergeron and Jérôme Langlois. The band was one of the Quebec progressive rock scene&#x27;s longest running and consistent bands. In 1974, Vigneault and Leclerc played on the Plains of Abraham with Robert Charlebois, who made heavy use of Quebec French in his rock and roll fusions. 
In 1976, multi-instrumentalist sisters Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle emerged on the international music scene with their blend of folk-rock and vocal harmonies added to self-penned songs in English and French, many of the latter co-written with Swiss-born poet Philippe Tatartcheff. The 1970s also saw roots performers like La Bottine Souriante gain critical and commercial acclaim within Quebec. Jim Corcoran and Bertrand Gosselin released &quot;La tête en gigue&quot;, an influential album that helped bring Quebec roots to crossover audiences across Canada, the United States and Europe.
In addition to his musical career, Corcoran currently hosts a weekly show on CBC Radio One, which airs Francophone music from Quebec for English audiences across Canada.
The early 1980s saw the formation of francophone synthpop/new wave groups such as Nudimension that became involved in the genesis of music video and MTV culture.

More recent Quebec performers include Richard Desjardins, Daniel Boucher, Marie-Chantal Toupin, Éric Lapointe, Vilain Pingouin, Mes Aïeux, Les Trois Accords, Kaïn, Dumas, La Chicane, Les Colocs, Mélanie Renaud, Cindy Daniel, Daniel Bélanger, Paul Cargnello, Laurence Jalbert, Rudy Caya, Jean Leloup, Celine Dion (who had 4 No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits like &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; in 1998), Les Stups, La Chicane, Dan Bigras, Isabelle Boulay and more recently Cœur de pirate. Some bands, such as Les Cowboys Fringants have known success in Europe (primarily in France) while Karkwa, Vulgaires Machins, Les Batinses and Malajube are also recognized elsewhere in Canada and internationally.

Hip-hop has been widely active in the Montreal area with groups like Loco Locass, Sans Pression, Dionysos, Criollo, Atach Tatuq, Manu Militari, KCLMNOP, Imposs, Muzion and Dubmatique.

Heavy metal, and other adjacent metal genres, have as well played a significant role in Quebec&#x27;s musical repertoire, represented notably by Sword, Voivod and death metal bands Cryptopsy, Kataklysm, Martyr, Neuraxis, Gorguts, Quo Vadis, Despised Icon, Ex Deo, Blackguard, Beneath the Massacre, Augury and many others. The Quebec black metal scene has also gotten some attention in recent years, including bands like Akitsa, Spirit of the Forest, Forteresse, Chasse-Galerie, Monarque and Nefastus Dies.

In 2003, TVA began to broadcast &quot;Star Académie&quot;, a Québécois version of a French reality music competition, several new artists including Marie-Élaine Thibert, Marie-Mai, Émily Bégin and Stéphanie Lapointe became well-known music artists after their passage in the reality show.

The tensions between Quebec and English Canada have, at times, played out on Quebec&#x27;s music scene as well. In 1991, Céline Dion won the Félix award for Best Anglophone Artist for her English-language debut, &quot;Unison&quot;, but refused it as she did not view herself as an Anglophone artist.

Quebec has also produced a number of significant Anglophone artists, including Arcade Fire (who had 3 No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 like &quot;The Suburbs&quot; in 2010.) Win Butler graduated from McGill University in Montreal in 2004. Régine Chassagne also went there. Other Anglophone artists from Quebec include Patrick Watson, The Dears, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Riverbeds, Stars, The Stills, The Unicorns, Wolf Parade, Rufus Wainwright, Sam Roberts, Paul Cargnello, We Are Wolves, The New Cities, Chromeo, Simple Plan and William Shatner. In addition, some Quebec artists from the 1960s to the 1980s Lewis Furey, Men Without Hats, Norman Iceberg, Rational Youth, Corey Hart, Julie Masse, Martine St. Clair, Marjo, Offenbach, The Box, Gino Vannelli, Luba, Jacynthe, France Joli, Sass Jordan, and Grimskunk have frequently recorded both English and French material.

Quebec artists have dominated the long and short lists of the Polaris Music Prize. Among them, Arcade Fire, Patrick Watson, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Karkwa and Backxwash have all won the coveted award.

==Jazz music==
Some famous jazz musicians from Quebec are Oscar Peterson, Paul Bley, Oliver Jones, Charles Biddle, Ranee Lee, Karen Young, and Alain Caron.

The Montreal International Jazz Festival is a globally renowned jazz festival,having been hosted by the city since 1980 it&#x27;s attracting thousands of visitors annually. For the rest of the year, the L&#x27;OFF Festival de Jazz de Montreal organizes jazz shows in bars across Montreal.

== Classical music ==
The early part of the 20th century saw growth in opera, and the foundation of the Montreal Opera Company in 1910, and opera singers became popular.

André Gagnon, Angèle Dubeau, Michael Laucke, Louis Lortie, Alain Lefèvre, Alain Trudel, Alexandre Da Costa, Marc-André Hamelin, Nathalie Choquette and Richard Verreau are established classical musicians from Québec at the present. 

André Mathieu is among the renowned composers from the province. He has been compared to a &#x27;little Canadian Mozart&#x27;, and Rachmaninov pronounced him, &quot;a genius, more so than I am&quot;. His works became the official music of the Summer Olympics of 1976. Other famous composers are Claude Champagne, Calixa Lavallée, Pierre Mercure, Jacques Hétu, André Gagnon, Airat Ichmouratov, Denis Gougeon, José Evangelista and composer-critic Alfred La Liberté, among others.

==Quebec and France==
Both nations have influenced each other in terms of music styles. In recent years, Quebec singers have gained notable recognition on the French stage. Quebec singers that have performed in France included: Céline Dion, Garou, Anthony Kavanagh (a stand-up comedian), Isabelle Boulay, Bruno Pelletier, Lynda Lemay, Cœur de pirate and many others.

Roch Voisine and Natasha St-Pier are two artists who also perform in France and are often mistaken for Quebecers. They are actually from New Brunswick and are of Acadian heritage, like Daniel Lavoie who is from Manitoba.

==Musicals==
Few musicals were made or adapted by Quebec artists. Among them, Luc Plamondon has had the brightest career as a songwriter, writing for the big ones (Céline Dion, Garou). The main musicals &#x27;made in Quebec&#x27; : &quot;Starmania&quot;, &quot;La Légende de Jimmy&quot;, &quot;Notre-Dame-de-Paris&quot;, &quot;Chicago (adapted into French)&quot;, &quot;Demain matin, Montréal m&#x27;attend&quot;, &quot;Dracula&quot;.

==Le Cirque du Soleil==
Cirque du Soleil develops its own musical pieces to go along with various acrobatic tricks. The music aspect of the show is essential as it sets a mood for performances and links one number to another.

<doc id="435836" wikidata="Q1129350" url="?curid=435836" title="List of human spaceflights">
<text>This is a list of all crewed spaceflights throughout history. Beginning in 1961 with the flight of Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1, crewed spaceflight occurs when a human crew flies a spacecraft into outer space. Human spaceflight is distinguished from spaceflight generally, which entails both crewed and uncrewed spacecraft.

There are two definitions of spaceflight. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), an international record-keeping body, defines the boundary between Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and outer space at above sea level. This boundary is known as the Kármán line. The United States awards astronaut wings to qualified personnel who pilot a spaceflight above an altitude of .

As of the launch of SpaceX Crew-9 on 28 September 2024, there have been 391 human spaceflight launches. Two missions did not cross either the Kármán line or the U.S. definition of space and therefore do not qualify as spaceflights. These were the fatal STS-51-L (Challenger disaster), and the non-fatal aborted Soyuz mission T-10a. Two aborted missions did cross either the Kármán line or the U.S. definition of space. These were the non-fatal aborted Soyuz mission MS-10 which did not reach the Kármán line but did pass the 80 km (50 mi) line. The other was the non-fatal Soyuz mission, 18a which crossed the Kármán line. Four missions successfully achieved human spaceflight, yet ended as fatal failures as their crews died during the return. These were Soyuz 1, X-15 flight 191, Soyuz 11, and STS-107 (&quot;Columbia&quot; disaster). Twenty two flights in total reached an apogee beyond , but failed to go beyond , so therefore do not qualify as spaceflights under the FAI definition.

==Summary==

Since 1961, three countries (China, Russia, and the United States) and one former country (Soviet Union) have conducted human spaceflight using seventeen different spacecraft series, or: &quot;programs&quot;, &quot;projects&quot;.


==Human spaceflights==
The Salyut series, Skylab, Mir, ISS, and Tiangong series space stations, with which many of these flights docked in orbit, are not listed separately here. See the detailed lists (links below) for information.

* Missions which were intended to reach space but which failed to do so are listed in bold.
* Missions between 50 miles (80.45 km) and 100 km (62 mi), which satisfy the US Military definition of space(50 Miles), but not the NASA or Internationally recognized Karman Line definition (100 KM) are listed in &quot;italics.&quot;
* Fatal missions are marked with a dagger (†) symbol.

* &quot;Spacefacts&quot; Compare with the present article. The &quot;Spacefacts&quot; list includes most flights listed here, but omits twelve: The three failed launches of STS-51-L, Soyuz T-10a and Soyuz MS-10, none of which achieved human spaceflight, the uncrewed launch of Soyuz 34 (which nevertheless returned a crew to Earth), and the eight sub-orbital human spaceflights: Mercury-Redstone 3 and 4, X-15 flights 90 and 91, SpaceShipOne flights 15P, 16P and 17P, and Soyuz 18a.

<doc id="435852" wikidata="Q1754803" url="?curid=435852" title="Register renaming">
<text>In computer architecture, register renaming is a technique that abstracts logical registers from physical registers.
Every logical register has a set of physical registers associated with it.
When a machine language instruction refers to a particular logical register, the processor transposes this name to one specific physical register on the fly.
The physical registers are opaque and cannot be referenced directly but only via the canonical names.

This technique is used to eliminate false data dependencies arising from the reuse of registers by successive instructions that do not have any real data dependencies between them.
The elimination of these false data dependencies reveals more instruction-level parallelism in an instruction stream, which can be exploited by various and complementary techniques such as superscalar and out-of-order execution for better performance.

== Problem approach ==
Programs are composed of instructions which operate on values. The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another. A typical instruction might say: add formula_1 and formula_2 and put the result in formula_3. In this instruction, formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3 are the names of storage locations.

It is common for the values being manipulated to be used several times in succession. Register machines take advantage of this by introducing a number of processor registers, which are high-speed memory locations that hold these values. Instructions that use the registers as intermediate values will run much faster than those that access main memory. This performance increase is a key design element of the RISC processor design, which uses registers for all of its primary math and logical instructions. The collection of registers in a particular design is known as its &quot;register file&quot;.

Individual registers in the file are referred to by number in the machine code. Encoding a number in the machine code requires several bits. For instance, in the Zilog Z80 there were eight general-purpose registers in the file. To select one of eight values requires three bits, as 23 = 8. More registers in the file will result in better performance, as more temporary values can be held in the file and thus avoid the expensive operations of saving or loading from memory. Generally, more modern processors and those with larger instruction words will use more registers when possible. For example, the IA-32 instruction set architecture has 8 general purpose registers, x86-64 has 16, many RISCs have 32, and IA-64 has 128.

The advantages of a larger register file are offset by the need to use more bits to encode the register number. For instance, in a system using 32-bit instructions, you might wish to have three registers, such that you can perform operations of the type formula_3 = formula_8. If the register file contains 32 entries, each one of the references will require 5 bits, and the set of three registers thus takes up 15 bits, leaving 17 to encode the operation and other information. Expanding the register file to 64 entries would require 6 bits, a total of 18 bits. While this may result in faster performance, it also means there are fewer bits left over for encoding the instruction. This leads to an effort to balance the size of the file with the number of possible instructions.

===Out-of-order===
Early computers often worked lock-step with their main memory, which reduced the advantages of large register files. A common design note from the minicomputer market of the 1960s was to have the registers be physically implemented in main memory, in which case the performance advantage was simply that the instruction could directly refer to the location rather than having to use a second byte or two to specify a complete memory address. This made the instructions smaller, and thus faster to read. This sort of design, which maximized performance by carefully tuning the instruction set for minimal size, was common until the 1980s. An example of this approach is the MOS 6502, which had only a single register, in which case it is referred to as the accumulator, and a special &quot;zero page&quot; addressing mode that treated the first 256 bytes of memory as if they were registers. Placing code and data in the zero page meant the instruction was only two bytes long instead of three, greatly improving performance through avoided reads.

The widespread introduction of dynamic RAM in the 1970s changed this approach. Over time, the performance of the central processing units (CPUs) increased relative to the memory they were attached to, it was no longer reasonable to use main memory as registers. This led to increasingly large register files, internal to the CPU, to avoid referring to memory wherever possible. However, it is not possible to avoid accessing memory entirely in practice, and as the speed difference grew, every such access became more and more expensive in terms of the number of instructions that might be performed had the value been in a register.

Different instructions may take different amounts of time; for example, a processor may be able to execute hundreds of register-to-register instructions while a single load from the main memory is in progress. A key advance in improving performance is to allow those fast instructions to be performed while the others are waiting for data. This means the instructions are no longer completed in the order they are specified in the machine code, they are instead performed out-of-order.

Consider this piece of code running on an out-of-order CPU:

 r1 ≔ m[1024] ;read the value in memory location 1024
 r1 ≔ r1 + 2 ;add two to the value
 m[1032] ≔ r1 ;save the result to location 1032
 r1 ≔ m[2048] ;read value in 2048
 r1 ≔ r1 + 4 ;add 4
 m[2056] ≔ r1 ;save it to 2056

The instructions in the final three lines are independent of the first three instructions, but the processor cannot finish r1 ≔ m[2048] until the preceding m[1032] ≔ r1 is complete, as doing so would add four to the value of 1024, not 2048.

If another register is available, this restriction can be eliminated by choosing different registers for the first three and the second three instructions:

 r1 ≔ m[1024]
 r1 ≔ r1 + 2
 m[1032] ≔ r1
 r2 ≔ m[2048]
 r2 ≔ r2 + 4
 m[2056] ≔ r2
Now the last three instructions can be executed in parallel with the first three. The program will run faster than before by eliminating the data dependency caused by unnecessarily using the same register in both sequences. A compiler can detect independent instruction sequences and, if there are registers that are available for use, choose different registers during register allocation in the code generation process.

However, to speed up code generated by compilers that do not perform that optimization, or code for which there were not sufficient registers to perform that optimization, many high-performance CPUs provide a register file with more registers than are specified in the instruction set, and, in hardware, rename references in instruction-set-defined registers to refer to registers in the register file, so that the original instruction sequence, using only r1, behaves as if it were:
 rA ≔ m[1024]
 rA ≔ rA + 2
 m[1032] ≔ rA
 rB ≔ m[2048]
 rB ≔ rB + 4
 m[2056] ≔ rB
with register r1 &quot;renamed&quot; to the internal register rA for the first three instructions and to the internal register rB for the second three instructions. This removes the false data dependency, allowing the first three instructions to be executed in parallel with the second three instructions.

== Data hazards ==

When more than one instruction references a particular location as an operand, either by reading it (as an input) or by writing to it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to three kinds of data hazards:
; Read-after-write (RAW)
: a read from a register or memory location must return the value placed there by the last write in program order, not some other write. This is referred to as a &quot;true dependency&quot; or &quot;flow dependency&quot;, and requires the instructions to execute in program order.
; Write-after-write (WAW)
: successive writes to a particular register or memory location must leave that location containing the result of the second write. This can be resolved by &quot;squashing&quot; (also known as cancelling, annulling, or mooting) the first write if necessary. WAW dependencies are also known as &quot;output dependencies&quot;.
; Write-after-read (WAR)
: a read from a register or memory location must return the last prior value written to that location, and not one written programmatically after the read. This is a sort of &quot;false dependency&quot; that can be resolved by renaming. WAR dependencies are also known as &quot;anti-dependencies&quot;.

Instead of delaying the write until all reads are completed, two copies of the location can be maintained, the old value and the new value.
Reads that precede, in program order, the write of the new value can be provided with the old value, even while other reads that follow the write are provided with the new value.
The false dependency is broken and additional opportunities for out-of-order execution are created.
When all reads that need the old value have been satisfied, it can be discarded.
This is the essential concept behind register renaming.

Anything that is read and written can be renamed.
While the general-purpose and floating-point registers are discussed the most, flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well.

Memory locations can also be renamed, although it is not commonly done to the extent practiced in register renaming.
The Transmeta Crusoe processor&#x27;s gated store buffer is a form of memory renaming.

If programs refrained from reusing registers immediately, there would be no need for register renaming.
Some instruction sets (e.g., IA-64) specify very large numbers of registers for specifically this reason.
However, there are limitations to this approach:
* It is very difficult for the compiler to avoid reusing registers without large code size increases. In loops, for instance, successive iterations would have to use different registers, which requires replicating the code in a process called loop unrolling, or utilising self-modifying code to change the operand targets in each iteration.
* Large numbers of registers require more bits for specifying a register as an operand in an instruction, resulting in increased code size.
* Many instruction sets historically specified smaller numbers of registers and cannot be changed while still retaining backwards compatibility.

Code size increases are important because when the program code is larger, the instruction cache misses more often and the processor stalls waiting for new instructions.

== Architectural versus physical registers ==
Machine language programs specify reads and writes to a limited set of registers specified by the instruction set architecture (ISA).
For instance, the Alpha ISA specifies 32 integer registers, each 64 bits wide, and 32 floating-point registers, each 64 bits wide.
These are the &quot;architectural&quot; registers.
Programs written for processors running the Alpha instruction set will specify operations reading and writing those 64 registers.
If a programmer stops the program in a debugger, they can observe the contents of these 64 registers (and a few status registers) to determine the progress of the machine.

One particular processor which implements this ISA, the Alpha 21264, has 80 integer and 72 floating-point &quot;physical&quot; registers.
There are, on an Alpha 21264 chip, 80 physically separate locations which can store the results of integer operations, and 72 locations which can store the results of floating point operations
(In fact, there are even more locations than that, but those extra locations are not germane to the register renaming operation.)

The following text describes two styles of register renaming, which are distinguished by the circuit which holds the data ready for an execution unit.

In all renaming schemes, the machine converts the architectural registers referenced in the instruction stream into tags.
Where the architectural registers might be specified by 3 to 5 bits, the tags are usually a 6 to 8 bit number.
The rename file must have a read port for every input of every instruction renamed every cycle, and a write port for every output of every instruction renamed every cycle. Because the size of a register file generally grows as the square of the number of ports, the rename file is usually physically large and consumes significant power.

In the &quot;tag-indexed register file&quot; style, there is one large register file for data values, containing one register for every tag.
For example, if the machine has 80 physical registers, then it would use 7 bit tags. 48 of the possible tag values in this case are unused. In this style, when an instruction is issued to an execution unit, the tags of the source registers are sent to the physical register file, where the values corresponding to those tags are read and sent to the execution unit.

In the &quot;reservation station&quot; style, there are many small associative register files, usually one at the inputs to each execution unit.
Each operand of each instruction in an issue queue has a place for a value in one of these register files. In this style, when an instruction is issued to an execution unit, the register file entries corresponding to the issue queue entry are read and forwarded to the execution unit.

; Architectural Register File or Retirement Register File (RRF)
: The committed register state of the machine. RAM indexed by logical register number. Typically written into as results are retired or committed out of a reorder buffer.
; Future File
: The most speculative register state of the machine. RAM indexed by logical register number.
; Active Register File
: The Intel P6 group&#x27;s term for Future File.
; History Buffer
: Typically used in combination with a future file. Contains the &quot;old&quot; values of registers that have been overwritten. If the producer is still in flight it may be RAM indexed by history buffer number. After a branch misprediction must use results from the history buffer—either they are copied, or the future file lookup is disabled and the history buffer is content-addressable memory (CAM) indexed by logical register number.
; Reorder Buffer (ROB)
: A structure that is sequentially (circularly) indexed on a per-operation basis, for instructions in flight. It differs from a history buffer because the reorder buffer typically comes after the future file (if it exists) and before the architectural register file. Reorder buffers can be data-less or data-ful. Some examples: In Willamette&#x27;s ROB, the ROB entries point to registers in the physical register file (PRF), and also contain other book keeping. This was also the first Out of Order design done by Andy Glew, at Illinois with HaRRM. P6&#x27;s ROB, the ROB entries contain data; there is no separate PRF. Data values from the ROB are copied from the ROB to the RRF at retirement. One small detail: if there is temporal locality in ROB entries (i.e., if instructions close together in the von Neumann instruction sequence write back close together in time, it may be possible to perform write combining on ROB entries and so have fewer ports than a separate ROB/PRF would). It is not clear if it makes a difference, since a PRF should be banked. ROBs usually don&#x27;t have associative logic, and certainly none of the ROBs designed by Andy Glew have CAMs. Keith Diefendorff insisted that ROBs have complex associative logic for many years. The first ROB proposal may have had CAMs.

=== Tag-indexed register file ===
This is the renaming style used in the MIPS R10000, the Alpha 21264, and in the FP section of the AMD Athlon.

In the renaming stage, every architectural register referenced (for read or write) is looked up in an architecturally-indexed remap file.
This file returns a tag and a ready bit.
The tag is non-ready if there is a queued instruction which will write to it that has not yet executed.
For read operands, this tag takes the place of the architectural register in the instruction.
For every register write, a new tag is pulled from a free tag FIFO, and a new mapping is written into the remap file, so that future instructions reading the architectural register will refer to this new tag.
The tag is marked as unready, because the instruction has not yet executed.
The previous physical register allocated for that architectural register is saved with the instruction in the reorder buffer, which is a FIFO that holds the instructions in program order between the decode and graduation stages.

The instructions are then placed in various issue queues.
As instructions are executed, the tags for their results are broadcast, and the issue queues match these tags against the tags of their non-ready source operands.
A match means that the operand is ready.
The remap file also matches these tags, so that it can mark the corresponding physical registers as ready.
When all the operands of an instruction in an issue queue are ready, that instruction is ready to issue.
The issue queues pick ready instructions to send to the various functional units each cycle.
Non-ready instructions stay in the issue queues.
This unordered removal of instructions from the issue queues can make them large and power-consuming.

Issued instructions read from a tag-indexed physical register file (bypassing just-broadcast operands) and then execute.
Execution results are written to tag-indexed physical register file, as well as broadcast to the bypass network preceding each functional unit.
Graduation puts the previous tag for the written architectural register into the free queue so that it can be reused for a newly decoded instruction.

An exception or branch misprediction causes the remap file to back up to the remap state at last valid instruction via combination of state snapshots and cycling through the previous tags in the in-order pre-graduation queue.
Since this mechanism is required, and since it can recover any remap state (not just the state before the instruction currently being graduated), branch mispredictions can be handled before the branch reaches graduation, potentially hiding the branch misprediction latency.

=== Reservation stations ===

This is the style used in the integer section of the AMD K7 and K8 designs.

In the renaming stage, every architectural register referenced for reads is looked up in both the architecturally-indexed future file and the rename file.
The future file read gives the value of that register, if there is no outstanding instruction yet to write to it (i.e., it&#x27;s ready).
When the instruction is placed in an issue queue, the values read from the future file are written into the corresponding entries in the reservation stations.
Register writes in the instruction cause a new, non-ready tag to be written into the rename file.
The tag number is usually serially allocated in instruction order—no free tag FIFO is necessary.

Just as with the tag-indexed scheme, the issue queues wait for non-ready operands to see matching tag broadcasts.
Unlike the tag-indexed scheme, matching tags cause the corresponding broadcast value to be written into the issue queue entry&#x27;s reservation station.

Issued instructions read their arguments from the reservation station, bypass just-broadcast operands, and then execute.
As mentioned earlier, the reservation station register files are usually small, with perhaps eight entries.

Execution results are written to the reorder buffer, to the reservation stations (if the issue queue entry has a matching tag), and to the future file if this is the last instruction to target that architectural register (in which case register is marked ready).

Graduation copies the value from the reorder buffer into the architectural register file.
The sole use of the architectural register file is to recover from exceptions and branch mispredictions.

Exceptions and branch mispredictions, recognized at graduation, cause the architectural file to be copied to the future file, and all registers marked as ready in the rename file.
There is usually no way to reconstruct the state of the future file for some instruction intermediate between decode and graduation, so there is usually no way to do early recovery from branch mispredictions.

=== Comparison between the schemes ===
In both schemes, instructions are inserted in-order into the issue queues, but are removed out-of-order.
If the queues do not collapse empty slots, then they will either have many unused entries, or require some sort of variable priority encoding for when multiple instructions are simultaneously ready to go.
Queues that collapse holes have simpler priority encoding, but require simple but large circuitry to advance instructions through the queue.

Reservation stations have better latency from rename to execute, because the rename stage finds the register values directly, rather than finding the physical register number, and then using that to find the value.
This latency shows up as a component of the branch misprediction latency.

Reservation stations also have better latency from instruction issue to execution, because each local register file is smaller than the large central file of the tag-indexed scheme.
Tag generation and exception processing are also simpler in the reservation station scheme, as discussed below.

The physical register files used by reservation stations usually collapse unused entries in parallel with the issue queue they serve, which makes these register files larger in aggregate, and consume more power, and more complicated than the simpler register files used in a tag-indexed scheme.
Worse yet, every entry in each reservation station can be written by every result bus, so that a reservation-station machine with, e.g., 8 issue queue entries per functional unit will typically have 9 times as many bypass networks as an equivalent tag-indexed machine.
Consequently, result forwarding consumes much more power and area than in a tag-indexed design.

Furthermore, the reservation station scheme has four places (Future File, Reservation Station, Reorder Buffer and Architectural File) where a result value can be stored, whereas the tag-indexed scheme has just one (the physical register file).
Because the results from the functional units, broadcast to all these storage locations, must reach a much larger number of locations in the machine than in the tag-indexed scheme, this function consumes more power, area, and time.
Still, in machines equipped with very accurate branch prediction schemes and if execute latencies are a major concern, reservation stations can work remarkably well.

== History ==
The IBM System/360 Model 91 was an early machine that supported out-of-order execution of instructions; it used the Tomasulo algorithm, which uses register renaming.

The POWER1 from 1990 is the first microprocessor that used register renaming and out-of-order execution. This processor implemented register renaming only for floating-point loads. The POWER1 had only one FPU, so using renaming for floating-point instructions other than memory operation was unnecessary. The POWER2 had multiple FPUs, so renaming was used for all floating-point instructions.

The original R10000 design had neither collapsing issue queues nor variable priority encoding, and suffered starvation problems as a result—the oldest instruction in the queue would sometimes not be issued until both instruction decode stopped completely for lack of rename registers, and every other instruction had been issued.
Later revisions of the design starting with the R12000 used a partially variable priority encoder to mitigate this problem.

Early out-of-order machines did not separate the renaming and ROB/PRF storage functions.
For that matter, some of the earliest, such as Sohi&#x27;s RUU or the Metaflow DCAF, combined scheduling, renaming, and storage all in the same structure.

Most modern machines do renaming by RAM indexing a map table with the logical register number.
E.g., P6 did this; future files do this, and have data storage in the same structure.

However, earlier machines used content-addressable memory (CAM) in the renamer.
E.g., the HPSM RAT, or Register Alias Table, essentially used a CAM on the logical register number in combination with different versions of the register.

In many ways, the story of out-of-order microarchitecture has been how these CAMs have been progressively eliminated.
Small CAMs are useful; large CAMs are impractical.

The P6 microarchitecture was the first microarchitecture by Intel to implement both out-of-order execution and register renaming.
The P6 microarchitecture was used in Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium M, Core, and Core 2 microprocessors.
The Cyrix M1, released on October 2, 1995, was the first x86 processor to use register renaming and out-of-order execution.
Other x86 processors (such as NexGen Nx686 and AMD K5) released in 1996 also featured register renaming and out-of-order execution of RISC μ-operations (rather than native x86 instructions).

<doc id="435855" wikidata="Q983370" url="?curid=435855" title="Ezzedine Salim">
<text>Ezzedine Salim (), also known as Abdelzahra Othman Mohammed (23 March 1943 – 17 May 2004, عبد الزهراء عثمان محمد), was an Iraqi politician, author, educator, Islamist theorist and one of the leading members of the Iraqi Dawaa Movement between 1980 and 2004. He served as the President of the Governing Council of Iraq (45th Prime Minister of Iraq) in 2004.

Author of over 50 books, including history, Islamic events and works on education, he is best known in the Muslim world for his work on what he believed to be the social and political role of Islam, particularly in his book Political Opposition in the experience of Imam Ali(as). His magnum opus, Fatima Bint Muhammad, is a high calibre commentary on the life of Fatima, the daughter of Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

==Biography==

Born in the city of Basra, Salim began studying religion and politics at a young age. At the age of 19 he joined the Shiite group Islamic Dawa Party, whose members were quickly noticed by the Baath Party as a threat to their power. He left Iraq in his early twenties to go and live in Kuwait.

After a short time in Kuwait, he went to Iran where he began his career as an editor in many newspapers as well as his main job in the SCIRI (Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq). During his stay in Iran, he gained recognition as a Mujtahid (a high-ranking Islamic scholar). He wrote over 100 books covering topics ranging from religion to politics.

Salim headed the &quot;Daawa al-Islamiyah&quot; (&quot;Invitation to Islam&quot;) party, an Islamist party officially being referred to (in 2004) as Daawa Islamic Party. Known as a writer, philosopher, thinker and political activist, he started his political party as a vehicle to coordinate opposition against Saddam Hussein. The party was quickly recognized as a strong anti-Saddam group. It gained many supporters over the years, and became respected not only in Iraq, Iran and the Middle East but throughout the world. Salim survived numerous assassination attempts by Saddam&#x27;s followers, and deliberately changed his name to avoid being tracked.

In July 2003, Salim was given a position on the Iraqi Governing Council by the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, where he was serving as a crucial member. At a &quot;town hall&quot; meeting with press and public on 25 April 2004 he was asked whether Iraq could retain its identity as an Arab nation under a democracy. Ezzedine Salim responded, “Iraq is a member of the Arab League, but all are represented here now, including Turkmen, Kurds and Christians for example. Iraq is full of diversity.”

He became president of the Council on 1 May 2004. Ezzedine Salim was to serve as Council President until the formal handover of power to a new government on 30 June. However, he was killed by a suicide car bomb near the Green Zone on 17 May 2004. Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad claimed responsibility.

<doc id="435856" wikidata="Q318298" url="?curid=435856" title="Rodrigo Carazo Odio">
<text>Rodrigo José Ramón Francisco de Jesús Carazo Odio (27 December 1926 – 9 December 2009) was a Costa Rican economist and politician who served as the 38th President of Costa Rica from 8 May 1978 to 8 May 1982.

==Early life==
Carazo was born in Cartago. Before serving as president, he was the Director of the Central Bank, General Manager for RECOPE (Costa Rica&#x27;s nationalized oil refinery business) and President of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica (1966-1967).

He married Estrella Zeledón Lizano in San José on April 16, 1947. The couple had five children: Rodrigo Alberto, Mario Ernesto, Jorge Manuel, Álvaro, and Rolando Martin. Their son, Rolando, was killed in a motorcycle accident in Rohrmoser, Costa Rica, in December 1979. He was traveling alone on his motorcycle when he failed to negotiate a turn losing control and colliding with a tree. He was 26 years old. 

==Presidency==
During and immediately following his term, Carazo played a central role in the founding of the University for Peace, a United Nations-affiliated educational institution that offers graduate programs in peace and development studies. His government also concentrated on and promoted the country&#x27;s petrochemical industry and even began exploration and digging near the Talamanca Mountain Ridge in search for petroleum. In the energy sector, his government inaugurated the hydroelectric plant in Lake Arenal. The Carazo government also regulated the excavation of gold in the southern region of the country.

On the international front, Carazo had to deal mainly with the radical changes in the neighboring country of Nicaragua, which had been under the control of the Somoza dictatorship for decades, whose rule Costa Rica had always opposed. As the Sandinista movement rose in the 1970s, Nicaragua was faced with civil unrest and small armed clashes. Costa Rica&#x27;s government supported any movement against Somoza and so backed the Sandinista insurgents. Many of the battles that took place in the Nicaraguan region bordering Costa Rica spilled onto Costa Rican soil. Carazo&#x27;s government warned Somoza to stay on his side of the border several times.

The government also started planning for the creation of a defence force to fight off any Somoza attempt to attack Costa Rican territory. The attacks finally ended in 1979 once the Sandinistas took control of the country, and Somoza was exiled. The government received a strong backlash from the public, and the opposition claimed that Carazo had failed to protect Costa Rica&#x27;s sovereignty. Furthermore, Carazo&#x27;s government allowed three US helicopters to touch down on national soil to facilitate Somoza&#x27;s escape from Nicaragua. That sent the President&#x27;s critics on a political bashing rampage, calling the matter a disrespect to national sovereignty. Later, in 1982, the Central American Democratic Community was formed in San José with US backing. Its aim was to isolate Nicaragua from the rest of Central America as long as they had a Communist regime in power. Another big move was in 1981, when Carazo&#x27;s government broke off all diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

Carazo&#x27;s government was plagued by economic instability and social unrest. During his presidency, there was a world economic recession. Petroleum prices were at historic highs, and the value of Costa Rica&#x27;s main crop, coffee, was falling. Against the advice of his Minister of Finance, Hernán Sáenz Jiménez, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Carazo instructed the Central Bank of Costa Rica to borrow heavily to maintain the value of the colón, the local currency, in the hope that an economic recovery was close at hand. That policy eventually became unsustainable, leading to a catastrophic sudden devaluation in September 1980. The heavy load of debt that the central bank acquired contributed to the highest rates of inflation that Costa Rica has endured ever since.

After stepping down as president in 1982, Carazo became a well-known critic of the IMF and other global financial institutions. In his last years, he campaigned vigorously against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

==Later life==
Carazo played a leadership role in initiatives to improve relations between North Korea and the West. He made several visits to Pyongyang in the early 1990s. His efforts contributed to the opening of unofficial channels of communication between the United States and North Korea.

Carazo was the founding Chairman of University for Peace and United World Colleges Costa Rica.

Carazo died from heart failure and multi-organ failure at the Hospital México in San José on December 9, 2009, at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife, former First Lady Estrella Zeledón Lizano, and four of their five children: Rodrigo Alberto, Mario Ernesto, Jorge Manuel and Álvaro.

Ziff Jr., his son, returned from Germany to lead the company. In 1958, Bernard Davis sold Ziff Jr. his share of Ziff Davis to found Davis Publications, Inc.; Ziff Davis continued to use the Davis surname as Ziff-Davis.

Throughout most of Ziff Davis&#x27; history, it was a publisher of hobbyist magazines, often ones devoted to expensive, advertiser-rich technical hobbies such as cars, photography, and electronics. Since 1980, Ziff Davis has primarily published computer-related magazines and related websites, establishing Ziff Davis as an Internet information company.

In October 1994, Ziff Davis announced its sale to investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Company for $1.4 billion. A small Foster City-based television operation named &quot;ZD-TV&quot; was listed as a company asset.

Ziff Davis had several broadcasting properties, first during the mid-1970s, and later with its own technology network ZDTV, later renamed to TechTV, that was sold to Vulcan Ventures in 2001. Ziff Davis&#x27; magazine publishing and Internet operations offices are based in New York City, Massachusetts, and San Francisco.

On January 6, 2009, the company sold 1UP.com to Hearst&#x27;s UGO Entertainment and announced the January 2009 issue of the long-running &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; magazine would be its last.

Former Time Inc. executive Vivek R. Shah, with financial backing from Boston private equity company Great Hill Partners, announced on June 4, 2010, the acquisition of Ziff Davis Inc. as the &quot;first step in building a new digital media company that specializes in producing and distributing content for consumers making important buying decisions.&quot;

On November 12, 2012, Ziff Davis Inc., was acquired by cloud computing services company J2 Global for $167 million cash. According to an October 2015 &quot;Fortune&quot; article, Ziff Davis comprised 30% of parent company J2 Global&#x27;s $600 million annual revenue in 2014 and was increasing 15% to 20% each year. Analyst Gregory Burns of Sidoti &amp; Company calculated that Ziff Davis is worth $1.9 billion.

In April 2021, J2 Global announced that it would spin off its cloud services business as Consensus; the transaction was approved by its shareholders in September 2021, with J2 Global consisting primarily of its media business and VPN services, and subsequently taking on the Ziff Davis, Inc. name and &quot;ZD&quot; ticker symbol, essentially converting the Ziff Davis purchase into a reverse merger.

===&quot;Popular Aviation&quot;===
The William B. Ziff Company, founded in 1920, was a successful Chicago advertising agency that secured advertising from national companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble for virtually all African American weekly newspapers. In 1923, Ziff acquired E. C. Auld Company, a Chicago publishing house. Ziff&#x27;s first venture in magazine publishing was &quot;Ziff&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which featured short stories, one-act plays, humorous verse, and jokes. The title was changed to &quot;America&#x27;s Humor&quot; in April 1926.

Bernard George Davis was the student editor of the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s humor magazine, the &quot;Pitt Panther&quot;, and was active in the Association of College Comics of the East. During his senior year he attended the association&#x27;s convention and met William B. Ziff. When Davis graduated in 1927 he joined Ziff as the editor of &quot;America&#x27;s Humor&quot;.

Ziff, who had been an aviator in World War I, created &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; in August 1927 that was published by Popular Aviation Publishing Company of Chicago, Illinois. Under editor Harley W. Mitchell it became the largest aviation magazine, with a circulation of 100,000 in 1929. The magazine&#x27;s title became &quot;Aeronautics&quot; in June 1929 and the publishing company&#x27;s name became Aeronautical Publications, Inc. The title was changed back to &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; in July 1930. The magazine became &quot;Flying&quot; in 1942 and is still published today by the Bonnier Corporation. The magazine celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2017.

The company histories normally give the founding date as 1927. This is when B.G. Davis joined and &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; magazine started. However, it was not until 1936 that the company became the &quot;Ziff-Davis Publishing Company&quot;. (&quot;Popular Aviation&quot;, April 1936, was the first issue by Ziff-Davis Publishing.) Davis was given a substantial minority equity interest in the company and was appointed a vice-president and director. He was later named president in 1946. Davis was a photography enthusiast and the editor of the &quot;Popular Photography&quot; magazine started in May 1937.

===Fiction, hobbyist and bridal magazines===
In early 1938, Ziff-Davis acquired the magazines &quot;Radio News&quot; and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. These were started by Hugo Gernsback but sold as a result of the Experimenter Publishing bankruptcy in 1929. Both magazines had declined since the bankruptcy but the resources of Ziff-Davis rejuvenated them starting with the April 1938 issues. &quot;Radio News&quot; was published until 1972. The magazine &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, derived from &quot;Radio News&quot;, was begun in 1955 and published until 1985. &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; was a leading science fiction magazine and Ziff Davis soon added a new companion, &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot; (FA). In 1954 &quot;FA&quot; was merged into the newer magazine &quot;Fantastic&quot;, founded in 1952 to great initial success. ZD published a number of other pulp magazines and, later, digest-sized fiction magazines during the 1940s and 1950s, and continued to publish &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; until 1965.

Ziff-Davis published comic books during the early 1950s, operating by their own name and also the name Approved Comics. Eschewing superheroes, they published horror, crime, sports, romance, and Western comics, though most titles did not last more than a few issues. Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel was the art director of the comics line; other notable creators who worked for Ziff-Davis Comics included John Buscema, Sid Greene, Bob Haney, Sam Kweskin, Rudy Lapick, Richard Lazarus, Mort Leav, Paul S. Newman, George Roussos, Mike Sekowsky, Ernie Schroeder, and Ogden Whitney. In 1953, the company mostly abandoned comics, selling its most popular titles—the romance comics &quot;Cinderella Love&quot; and &quot;Romantic Love&quot;, the Western &quot;Kid Cowboy&quot;, and the jungle adventure &quot;Wild Boy of the Congo&quot;—to St. John Publications. Ziff-Davis continued to publish one title, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, until 1957, a total of 51 issues.

From 1958, under the direction of sole owner Bill Ziff Jr., a polymath with a photographic memory, Ziff-Davis became a successful publisher of enthusiast magazines, purchasing titles like &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, and tailoring content for enthusiasts as well as purchasing agents (&quot;brand specifiers&quot;); the company was able to attract advertising money that other, general-interest publications were losing.

In 1958, Ziff-Davis began publishing a magazine, &quot;HiFi and Music Review&quot;, for the growing hobby of high fidelity equipment. Ultimately, the magazine evolved into &quot;Stereo Review&quot;. ZD also became a prolific publisher of photography and boating magazines during this period, and such magazines as &quot;Modern Bride&quot;; after the sale of &quot;Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot; in 1965, their editor Cele Goldsmith Lalli began working on the bridal magazines, becoming a notable and influential editor in that field before retirement.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the company&#x27;s success increased with this strategy, and a rapidly expanding interest in electronics and computing. With titles such as &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, and &quot;Computer Shopper&quot;, Ziff Davis became the leading technology magazine business.

Ziff Davis sold the majority of its consumer magazines to CBS and its trade magazines to News Corporation in 1984, keeping its computer magazines.

===Television stations===
In 1979, Ziff Davis expanded into broadcasting, after an acquisition of television stations originally owned by greeting card company Rust Craft. Ziff Davis&#x27;s stations included NBC affiliates WROC-TV in Rochester, New York and WRCB-TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee, CBS affiliates WEYI-TV in Saginaw, Michigan, WRDW-TV in Augusta, Georgia and WSTV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio (which changed its name to WTOV-TV and its network affiliation to NBC after Ziff Davis assumed control of the station), and ABC affiliate WJKS-TV in Jacksonville, Florida (which would also switch to NBC soon after its acquisition was finalized). These stations would be sold to other owners by the mid-1980s—most of these would become owned by a new ownership group, &quot;Television Station Partners&quot;, the exceptions being WRCB (which would be sold to Sarkes Tarzian) and WJKS (which was acquired by Media General).

===Technology magazines and web properties===
Ziff Davis first started technology-themed publications during 1954, with &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and, more briefly, &quot;Electronics World&quot;. This resulted more or less directly in its interest in home-computer magazines. From that time, Ziff Davis became a major publisher of computer and Internet-related publishing. It acquired &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1982, and the trade journal &quot;MacWEEK&quot; in 1988. In 1991, the company initiated ZiffNet, a subscription service that offered computing information to users of CompuServe. This grew into the news website ZDNet, launched in late 1994. In 1995 it initiated the magazine &quot;Yahoo! Internet Life&quot;, initially as &quot;ZD Internet Life&quot;. The magazine was meant to accompany and complement the site Yahoo!.

Owner William Bernard Ziff Jr. had wanted to give the business to his sons—Daniel, Dirk and Robert—but they did not want the responsibility. In 1994, he announced the sale of the publishing group to Forstmann Little &amp; Company for US$1.4 billion. It was then sold to SoftBank a year later.

In 1998, Ziff Davis started the ZDTV channel, a technology-themed television network. 

From 1999 through 2000, as part of an effort to restructure Ziff-Davis Inc, SoftBank would sell ZDTV to Paul Allen&#x27;s Vulcan Inc. which would later be renamed to TechTV, and spin off ZD and ZDNet. It also sold its magazine division to Willis Stein &amp; Partners L.P. for $780 million. In July 2000, CNET Networks agreed to acquire Ziff-Davis Inc. for $1.6 billion in stock. The combined company was considered the eighth-largest internet company.

Since 2004, Ziff Davis has annually hosted a trade show in New York City known as DigitalLife. DigitalLife showcases the newest technology in consumer electronics, gaming and entertainment. Unlike E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) or the Worldwide Developers Conference, DigitalLife is open to the public.

In November 2006, Ziff Davis announced the cancellation of &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot;. They cited a lack of interest in the magazine (and its demo disk) due to digital distribution. &quot;OPM&quot; had begun in 1997.

===Ziff Davis Media Inc.===
In 2001, the new company Ziff Davis Media Inc., a partnership of Willis Stein &amp; Partners and James Dunning (former Ziff Davis CEO, chairman, and president), made an agreement with CNET Networks Inc. and ZDNet to acquire the URLs of Ziff Davis. Ziff Davis Media Inc. gained thereby the online content licensing rights to 11 publications, including &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, &quot;CIO Insight&quot;, and &quot;eWEEK&quot;, webpage of industry insider Spencer Katt.

In July 2007, Ziff Davis Media announced the sale of its enterprise (B2B or business-to-business) division to Insight Venture Partners. The sale included all B2B publications, which include &quot;eWeek&quot;, Baseline, and CIOinsight, and all related online properties. The enterprise division is now an independent company named Ziff Davis Enterprise Group (ZDE).

On March 5, 2008, Ziff Davis Media Inc. announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in order to restructure its debt and operations. and emerged, after a court supervised corporate restructuring in July 2009. In conjunction with this announcement they also stated that they are discontinuing their print copy of PC Magazine. According to BtoBonline, Ziff Davis Media made an agreement with an ad hoc group of noteholders, who will provide $24.5 million to fund the company&#x27;s operations and help plan the restructuring.

===Acquisition by Great Hill Partners===

In June 2010, Boston private equity firm, Great Hill Partners, purchased Ziff Davis, with online media executive Vivek Shah. At the time, Ziff Davis properties consisted of PCMag.com, ExtremeTech, GearLog, GoodCleanTech, DLtv, AppScout, CrankyGeeks, Smart Device Central and TechSaver.com, and reached over 7 million users a month.

Shah, with intentions of revitalizing the business, serial purchased logicbuy.com, geek.com, computershopper.com, toolbox.com, and Focus Research. Focus Research was a major provider of online research to enterprise buyers and high-quality leads to IT vendors, operating ITManagement.com, ITSecurity.com, VOIP-News.com and InsideCRM.com. It was later renamed to Ziff Davis B2B Focus and operated as a stand-alone unit within Ziff Davis.

===Sale to J2 Global===

On November 16, 2012, Great Hill sold the company to J2 Global, a provider of cloud services. The purchase price was $175 million, approximately 2.9 times the estimated 2013 revenue. J2 Global actually paid $167 million in an all-cash deal.

On February 4, 2013, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment from News Corporation. Soon afterward, Ziff Davis announced the discontinuation of the 1UP.com, UGO.com, and GameSpy.com sites in order to &quot;[focus] on our two flagship brands, IGN and AskMen&quot;.

In 2013, Ziff Davis acquired NetShelter, a display advertising network oriented towards consumer electronics and technology publishers, from ImPowered. Also in 2013, Ziff Davis acquired TechBargains.com, a deal aggregation site for consumer electronics.

In 2014, Ziff Davis acquired eMedia Communications from Reed Business Information. In December 2014, Ziff Davis acquired Ookla, owner of Speedtest.net.

In 2015, Ziff Davis acquired Offers.com an online source of offers, deals, coupons, coupon codes, promos, free trials, and more.

In October 2016, Ziff Davis entered into an agreement to acquire Everyday Health. The deal was completed in December of that year.

In 2017, Ziff Davis acquired Mashable, an American entertainment, culture, tech, science and social good digital media platform, for $50 million. Following its acquisition of Mashable, Ziff Davis announced that it would implement longer, more in-depth content to boost the site&#x27;s search traffic and restructure the platform to reduce costs.

In 2018, Ziff Davis had 117 million readers, reaching 115 countries with 60 international editions. Most of Ziff Davis&#x27; international editions are partnerships with local publishers, all of whom use a domestic content management system. The common CMS lets oversea editions get content from Ziff Davis&#x27; owned-and-operated markets and re-purpose it for their own editions. To establish itself in foreign markets, Ziff Davis asks its local partner to hold events. Popular past events include IGN Convention Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar.

In November 2018, employees from Mashable, PCMag, AskMen, and Geek.com formed a union with the NewsGuild of New York. The Ziff Davis Creators Guild finalized its first contract in June 2021.

In 2019, Ziff Davis acquired Spiceworks, a professional network for the information technology industry.

In 2020, Ziff Davis acquired RetailMeNot for $420 million, an aggregator of coupon offers across multiple website properties.

===Rebrand as Ziff Davis, Inc.===

In April 2021, J2 Global announced plans to spin off its cloud fax business as a separate company known as Consensus. Following the split, J2 rebranded as Ziff Davis, Inc.

In 2023, Ziff Davis acquired Lifehacker for an undisclosed sum from G/O Media.

On February 6, 2024, employees at IGN publicly announced their intention to unionize as the IGN Creators Guild with NewsGuild-CWA. Ziff Davis voluntarily recognized the union later that month.

On May 21, 2024, it was reported that IGN Entertainment had acquired the Gamer Network from ReedPop. GamesIndustry.biz, Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247 and Dicebreaker were included in the deal. It also gained shares in OutsideXbox, Digital Foundry, and Hookshot (owners of NintendoLife, PushSquare, PureXbox, and Time Extension).

In August 2024, Ziff Davis acquired CNET from Red Ventures for $100 million.

On February 20, 2025 404 Media reported that Ziff Davis had quietly removed Diversity, equity, and inclusion language and information from its website over several weeks prior to the publishing of the report.

<text>ZDNET is a business technology news website owned and operated by Ziff Davis. The brand was founded on April 1, 1991, as a general interest technology portal from Ziff Davis and evolved into an enterprise IT-focused online publication. After being under the ownership of CNET Networks (2000–2008), CBS Corporation/ViacomCBS (2008–2020), and Red Ventures (2020–2024), ZDNET was reacquired by Ziff Davis in August 2024. CNET was included in the acquisition as well.

==History==
===Beginnings: 1991–1995===

ZDNET began as a subscription-based digital service called &quot;ZiffNet&quot; that offered computing information to users of CompuServe. It featured computer industry forums, events, features and searchable archives.

Initially, ZiffNet was intended to serve as a common place to find content from all Ziff-Davis print publications. As such, ZiffNet was an expansion on an earlier online service called PCMagNet for readers of PC Magazine. Launched in 1988, PCMagNet in turn was the evolution of Ziff Davis&#x27; first electronic publishing venture, a bulletin board, which launched in 1985.

In late 1994, Ziff-Davis expanded onto the World Wide Web under the name &quot;ZD Net&quot;. Dan Farber, former editor-in-chief of &quot;PC Week&quot; and &quot;MacWeek&quot;, was named editor-in-chief of the property. By June 1995, the site was recording web traffic of 2.5 million pageviews per week.

On June 20, 1995, Ziff-Davis announced the consolidation of its online information services under a single name, &quot;ZD Net&quot;. The service had grown its membership to 275,000 subscribers across six platforms: CompuServe, Prodigy, AT&amp;T Interchange, the Microsoft Network, AppleLink and eWorld.

===Early history: 1995–2000===

By its fifth anniversary in 1996, the collective &quot;ZD Net&quot; brand—now on the Web, America Online, Microsoft Network and Prodigy—counted 300,000 subscribers and was named the second-highest grossing advertising site on the web. The site also expanded overseas: initially to France, Germany and the United Kingdom; later to China, Australia, Hong Kong, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Taiwan and India.

In 1997, the website—now the brand&#x27;s flagship property—underwent another redesign that featured topical &quot;channels&quot; of content. It also marked the change in name from &quot;ZD Net&quot; to &quot;ZDNet&quot;.

====ZDNET News====

Two months prior, the company launched ZDNet News, or &quot;ZDNN&quot;, the site&#x27;s first dedicated section to original reportage. Among the journalists hired to staff the department were former Computer Shopper executive editor Charlie Cooper, San Jose Mercury News business editor Steve Hamm, PC Week Inside senior editor Bill Snyder, PC Week editor John Dodge, Computerworld editor Michael Fitzgerald and PC Week editorial director Jim Louderback.

The appointment of digital publishing executive Dan Rosensweig as ZDNet&#x27;s first president capped a year of significant change for the brand.

In 1998, ZDNet launched &quot;Inter@active Investor&quot;, or ZDII, a spin-off website for investors that offered financial news and information on technology companies.

====ZDTV====

On May 11, 1998, Ziff-Davis launched ZDTV as the first cable television channel and website to offer 24-hour programming about computing and the Internet. The venture, which was partly owned by Vulcan Enterprises, was supported with a staff of 170 and incorporated ZDNet content on its website, ZDTV.com. The channel would later become Tech TV.

By the end of 1998, ZDNet was the dominant technology brand online. It led its closest rival, CNET, by a 26 percent margin and was the 13th most popular site on the Web, reaching 8.4 million users, or 13.4 percent of all users on the Web. The site would reach an additional 600,000 users within a year.

====ZDNET the company====

In 1999, Ziff-Davis spun ZDNet off as a separate company and offered it as a tracking stock, ZDZ, to accompany the parent stock, ZD. An initial public offering raised $190 million, but the tracking stock was eliminated in early 2000 and revived as common stock. The new company soon acquired Updates.com, a software upgrade service. It was incorporated into the site&#x27;s &quot;Help Channel.&quot;

====Consumer expansion====

In 1999, ZDNet also launched &quot;Tech Life&quot;, a network of six consumer-focused tech sites intended to attract parents (&quot;FamilyPC&quot;), music listeners (&quot;ZDNet Music&quot;), gadget enthusiasts (&quot;ZDNet Equip&quot;), gamers (&quot;ZDNet GameSpot&quot;) and basic users (&quot;Internet Life&quot; with Yahoo).

It also launched &quot;Computer Stew&quot;, a web-based comedy show about technology that featured John Hargrave and Jay Stevens, as well as the first ZDNet Holiday Gift Guide.

On December 30, 1999, ZDNet launched a $25 million branding campaign in response to a $100 million advertising campaign launched by rival CNET.

ZDNet&#x27;s lead over the competition narrowed by 2000. Despite a record 10.7 million unique users in January, it managed only a 13 percent lead over the next competitor. By mid-2000, ZDNet had expanded to 23 countries in 14 languages on six continents.

===The CNET years: 2000–2007===

On July 19, 2000 CNET Networks (ZDNet&#x27;s largest rival) announced that it would acquire ZDNET for about $1.6 billion. Some analysts thought that the merger of CNET and ZDNET would lead to redundancy in their product offerings, but research revealed that their target audiences had just 25 percent overlap.

In 2001, Ziff Davis Media Inc. reached an agreement with CNET Networks Inc. and ZDNET to regain the URLs lost in the 2000 sale of Ziff Davis Inc, to Softbank Corp.

In 2002, CNET Networks launched ZDNET sister site Builder.com, a site intended for enterprise software developers. On July 7, 2002, CNET Networks acquired Newmediary for its database of more than 30,000 enterprise IT white papers. ZDNET had integrated its services into its &quot;Business &amp; Technology&quot; channel as early as January 2001.

====Realignment====

In 2003, CNET Networks redesigned and relaunched ZDNet as an enterprise-focused publication intended to help business executives make better technology decisions.

The entire site was realigned as part of a CNET Networks B2B portfolio that included CNET News.com, Builder.com and TechRepublic.

A &quot;Tech Update&quot; section was created to serve as a directory of proprietary IT research (dubbed &quot;IT Priorities&quot;), and a new &quot;Power Center&quot; was implemented to prominently feature webcasts, white papers and case studies from partners. ZDNet also offered eight enterprise-targeted newsletters, as well launched its first blogs.

In 2005, ZDNet Government was launched. Editorial features included writing by former Utah CIO Phil Windley, TechRepublic columnist Ramon Padilla and CNET News reporter Declan McCullagh. ZDNet also launched its first original podcasts in 2005.

====ZDNET Blogs====

In 2006, ZDNET experienced another redesign that reduced its editorial focus on traditional news articles and product reviews and emphasized a growing network of expert bloggers, now totaling more than 30. The blogs covered topics such as enterprise IT, open source, Web 2.0, Google, Apple and Microsoft, and featured journalists David Berlind, Mary Jo Foley and Larry Dignan.

On February 19, 2008, Larry Dignan was appointed editor-in-chief of ZDNet and editorial director of TechRepublic, replacing Dan Farber, who became editor-in-chief of CNET News.com.

===The CBS years: 2008–2020===

On May 17, 2008, CBS Corporation announced that it would acquire CNET Networks for approximately $1.8 billion. The entire company would be organized under its CBS Interactive division.

In May 2010, ZDNet redesigned its site to place emphasis on the topics its blog network covers—now &quot;Companies,&quot; &quot;Hardware,&quot; &quot;Software,&quot; &quot;Mobile,&quot; &quot;Security&quot; and &quot;Research&quot;—and de-emphasize the downloads and reviews it imported from CNET post-merger.

=== Red Ventures: 2020–2024 ===
After the CBS Corporation merged with Viacom to form ViacomCBS in 2019, ZDNet was sold to Red Ventures in September 2020. On August 17, 2022, ZDNet announced &quot;the biggest upgrade in the 31-year history of the brand, including a new hand-drawn logo and new brand color, &#x27;Energy Yellow&#x27;&quot;, in anticipation of &quot;a wave of technology advances to sweep the world&#x27;s biggest industries in the years ahead.&quot; In March 2023, ZDNet was affected by layoffs that cut 35% of its staff. In August 2024, Ziff Davis signed a deal to purchase CNET and ZDNet from Red Ventures. The deal completed later in 2024, bringing ZDNET back under the ownership of Ziff Davis for the first time since it was acquired by CNET Networks in 2000.

<doc id="435859" wikidata="Q654252" url="?curid=435859" title="Scottish Lowlands">
<text>The Lowlands ( or , ; , ) is a cultural and historical region of Scotland. 

The region is characterised by its relatively flat or gently rolling terrain as opposed to the mountainous landscapes of the Scottish Highlands. This area includes cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow and is known for its fertile farmland, historic sites, and urban centres. It is the more populous and industrialised part of Scotland compared to the sparsely populated Highlands.

Culturally, the Lowlands and the Highlands diverged from the Late Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands.

== Geography ==
Geographically, Scotland is divided into three distinct areas: the Highlands, the Central plain (Central Belt, in the Central Lowlands), and the Southern Uplands. The Lowlands cover roughly the latter two. The northeast plain is also &quot;low-land&quot;, both geographically and culturally, but in some contexts may be grouped together with the Highlands.

The Lowlands is not an official geographical or administrative area of the country. There are two main topographic regions: the Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The term &quot;Lowlands&quot; mainly refers to the Central Lowlands. However, in normal usage it refers to those parts of Scotland not in the Highlands (or Gàidhealtachd). The boundary is usually considered to be a line between Stonehaven and Helensburgh (on the Firth of Clyde). The Lowlands lie south and east of the line. Some parts of the Lowlands (such as the Southern Uplands) are not physically &quot;low&quot;, Merrick for example reaching , while some areas indisputably in the Highlands (such as Islay) are low-lying.

For other purposes, the boundary varies; but if the Boundary Fault is used, then the traditional Scottish counties entirely in the Lowlands are Ayrshire, Berwickshire, Clackmannanshire, Dumfriesshire, East Lothian, Fife, Kinross-shire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Lanarkshire, Midlothian, Peeblesshire, Renfrewshire, Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, West Lothian, and Wigtownshire. Prior to 1921, the counties of East Lothian, Midlothian, and West Lothian were known as Haddingtonshire, Edinburghshire, and Linlithgowshire.

Traditional Scottish counties which straddle the Boundary fault include Angus, Dunbartonshire, Stirlingshire, Perthshire, Kincardineshire, Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, and Moray.

The term &quot;Lowlands&quot; is sometimes used to refer specifically to the &quot;Central Lowlands&quot;, an area also known as the &quot;Midland Valley&quot;. This area mainly encompasses the basins of the Rivers Forth and Clyde, and houses approximately 80 percent of Scotland&#x27;s population (3.5 million in the Central Belt). Historically, the Midland Valley has been Scotland&#x27;s most agriculturally productive region. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it experienced significant industrialisation and urbanisation, driven by coal deposits. While coal mining and heavy industry have declined ever since, the Midland Valley&#x27;s economic importance endures. Today, it remains a central hub of the Scottish economy, with a focus on electronics, computer manufacturing, and service sectors like telecommunications, computer software, and finance.

The southernmost counties of Scotland, nearest the Anglo-Scottish border, are also known as the Borders. They are sometimes considered separately from the rest of the Lowlands. Many ancestors of the Scotch-Irish, as they are known in the United States, or Ulster-Scots, originated from the lowlands and borders region before migrating to the Ulster Plantation in the 17th century and later the American frontier, many prior to the American Revolution.

The term Scottish Lowlands is used with reference to the Scots language in contrast to the Scottish Gaelic spoken in the Highlands (although historically also in the lowlands until the 15th century and 18th century in Galloway), to the Scottish history and to the Scottish clan system, as well as in family history and genealogy.

==Military units==
Military units associated with the region at various times include the Lowland Brigade, the Royal Scots and the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division.

<text>Porfirio Ricardo José Luis Daniel Oduber Quirós (August 25, 1921 – October 13, 1991) was a Costa Rican politician, lawyer, philosopher, poet, and essayist. He served as the President of Costa Rica from 1974 to 1978. He is credited with the creation of the Sistema Nacional de Radio y Televisión and the Universidad Estatal a Distancia.

In 1926 he was enrolled in the kindergarten of the Dolorosa church in the city of San José. Between 1928 and 1933 he studied primary education at the Buenaventura Corrales School.

Oduber worked as a lawyer early in his career. In 1945, Oduber went to Canada to study philosophy at McGill University, graduating with a Master of Arts degree. In 1948, he returned to Costa Rica and participated in the revolution led by José Figueres Ferrer. When their faction won, he was named Secretary General of the Second Republic of Costa Rica.

Some time later he traveled to Paris, where he continued his philosophical studies at the Sorbonne. In 1948, while studying in France, he married Marjorie Elliott Sypher, the daughter of Canadian diplomats. The couple had two children, Luis Adrian and Ana María.

After returning to Costa Rica, he worked in national politics, working with the Figueres presidency campaign and becoming an Ambassador in Mexico and later in Europe. He also served as foreign minister from 1962 to 1964. He was President of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica from 1970 to 1973.

He initially ran for president in 1966, and was later elected in 1974. His government was very socially focused, dealing 
heavily with working class issues. He worked on raising the quality of life of 
rural areas and bettered pricing for agricultural products. A lot of attention was 
given to reforestation and the preservation of natural resources. On the international 
front, his government was popular amongst the Central American nations. During his term
in office, Oduber granted legal status to the communist party (1975) and restored consular relations with Cuba (1977). 
He sided and worked with Presidents Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos to defend 
Panama&#x27;s sovereignty.

The airport located near Liberia, Daniel Oduber International Airport, was named in his honor. There is a full statue of him in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica.

Daniel Oduber died on 13 October 1991 in Escazú.

<text>José Joaquín Antonio Trejos Fernández (18 April 1916 10 February 2010) was 35th President of Costa Rica from 1966 to 1970.
His parents were Juan Trejos Quirós and Emilia Fernández Aguilar. As a student he obtained degrees in mathematics and economics from the University of Costa Rica. During Mario Echandi&#x27;s administration he was part of Costa Rica&#x27;s delegation in the United Nations.
Trejos defeated Daniel Oduber in the election that secured him the presidency.

== Elected as president ==
Without any political experience he won the presidential election of 1966 as candidate of a &quot;Unificación Nacional&quot; coalition. His victory was a close win over Daniel Oduber Quirós, with less than 4000 votes in his favor. Voters elected 26 congressmen from his party and the opposition won 29 seats. 
During the Trejos presidency, the aggregated tax (IV) was introduced and the government debts were virtually erased.

<text>José María Hipólito Figueres Ferrer (25 September 1906 – 8 June 1990) served three terms as President of Costa Rica: 1948–1949, 1953–1958 and 1970–1974. During his first term in office he abolished the country&#x27;s army, nationalized its banking sector, granted women and Afro-Costa Ricans the right to vote, and offered Costa Rican nationality to people of African descent.

His son José María Figueres served as President of Costa Rica from 1994 to 1998.

==Early life and career==
Figueres was born on 25 September 1906 in San Ramón in Alajuela province. Figueres was the eldest of the four children of a Catalan doctor and his wife, a teacher, who had recently immigrated from Catalonia to San Ramón in west-central Costa Rica. Figueres&#x27; first language was Catalan.

In 1924, he left for Boston, United States, on a work and study trip. There he studied hydroelectric engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Figueres returned to Costa Rica in 1928 and bought a farm in Tarrazú. He named the farm &quot;The Endless Struggle&quot;.

Figueres became a successful coffee grower and rope manufacturer, employing more than 1,000 sharecroppers and factory laborers. Describing himself as a &quot;farmer-socialist&quot;, he built housing and provided medical care and recreation for his workers and established a community vegetable farm and a dairy with free milk for workers&#x27; children.

His sharecroppers could either sell hemp grown on his plantation to him at market price for use in his rope factory, or sell it elsewhere if they were offered a better price.

==Political career==

===Return to Costa Rica, the Caribbean Legion, and the Costa Rica Civil War (1944–1948)===
When Figueres returned to Costa Rica in 1944 following two years in exile for criticising President Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, he established the Democratic Party, which a year later transformed into the Social Democratic Party. The party was intended to be a counterweight to the ruling National Republican Party (PRN), led by former President Calderón and his successor Teodoro Picado Michalski. The highly controversial Calderón had angered Costa Rican elites, enacting a large social security retirement program and implementing national healthcare. Calderón was accused of corruption by the elites, providing a rallying cry for Figueres and the Social Democratic Party.

Figueres began training the Caribbean Legion, an irregular force of 700. Figueres launched a revolution along with other landowners and student agitators, hoping to overthrow the Costa Rican government. With plans of using Costa Rica as a base, the Legion planned next to remove the three Central American dictators. Washington officials closely watched the Legion&#x27;s activities, especially after Figueres carried out a series of terrorist attacks inside Costa Rica during 1945 and 1946 that were supposed to climax in a general strike, but the people did not respond.

Former President Calderón supporters prevented and invalidated the 1 March 1948 presidential election in which Otilio Ulate had allegedly defeated Calderón in his second term bid with fraud. In March–April 1948, the protests over the election results mushroomed into armed conflict, then into revolution. Figueres defeated Communist-led guerrillas and the Costa Rican Army, which had joined forces with President Picado.

With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day civil war was the bloodiest event in 20th-century Costa Rican history.

===Figueres as the provisional president (1948–1949)===
After the civil war, Figueres became president at the head of a provisional junta, known as the Founding Council, that held power for 18 months. During that time he took several actions:

* abolishing the army (as a precaution against the militarism that has perennially thwarted or undercut democracy in Central America) Figueres said he was inspired to disarm Costa Rica by H. G. Wells &quot;The Outline of History&quot;, which he read in 1920 while at MIT. &quot;The future of mankind cannot include armed forces. Police, yes, because people are imperfect.&quot;, he declared. Ever since, Costa Rica has had no army and has maintained a 7,500-member national police force for a population of over five million.
* enabled women and illiterates to vote,
* put into effect basic welfare legislation,
* nationalised banks,
* outlawed the Communist Party,
* directed the writing of a new constitution,
* guaranteed public education for all,
* gave citizenship to black immigrants&#x27; children,
* established civil service to eliminate the spoils system in government, and

&quot;In a short time, we decreed 834 reforms that completely changed the physiognomy of the country and brought a deeper and more human revolution than that of Cuba&quot;, Figueres said in a 1981 interview.

Once Figueres gained control, the legislation he passed regarding social reform was not that much different from Calderón&#x27;s proposals. In fact, it is believed by some historians, such as David LaWare, that Figueres&#x27; social reforms were more or less the same as Calderón&#x27;s Labor Code of 1943, with the primary difference being that Figueres had gained the power with which to enact the laws, holding the complete support of virtually all the country. Both of these leaders&#x27; programs were in many cases exactly like the ones Franklin D. Roosevelt passed during the Great Depression that helped lift the US out of its own economic slump and social decline it had faced in the 1930s. Figueres admired what president Franklin D. Roosevelt did; however, he noted that &quot;the price he had to pay to get his programs through was to leave the business community free overseas to set up dictatorships and do whatever they liked...What we need now is an international New Deal, to change the relations between North and South.&quot;

Figueres stepped down after 18 months, handing his power over to Otilio Ulate, and ever since Costa Ricans have settled their arguments constitutionally.

&quot;Your hands are not clean to fight communism when you don&#x27;t fight dictatorships&quot;, Figueres told American interviewers in 1951. &quot;It seems that the United States is not interested in honest government down here, as long as a government is not communist and pays lip service to democracy.&quot;

===Second term as President (1953–1958)===
In 1953, Figueres created the Partido Liberación Nacional (PLN), the most successful party in Costa Rican political history, and was returned to power in 1953. He has been considered to be the most important political figure in Costa Rica&#x27;s history.

During his various terms in office he nationalized the banking system and contributed to the construction of the Pan-American Highway that goes across Central America. He promoted the private industry sector and stimulated the national industry sector. He succeeded in energizing the country&#x27;s middle class creating a strong buffer between the upper and lower classes.

What most alarmed U.S. officials was Figueres&#x27;s material and moral support for the Caribbean Legion, even though Figueres had obviously lost interest in the Legion after he gained power. But Figueres still criticized U.S. support for the dictators, going so far as to boycott the 1954 inter-American meeting because it was held in Caracas, where President of Venezuela Marcos Pérez Jiménez, a military ruler, held sway.

Figueres happily cooperated with North American military plans. After the United States established the School of the Americas in the Panama Canal Zone to train Latin American officers in Anti-Communist techniques, more Costa Rican &quot;police&quot; graduated from the School between 1950 and 1965 than did officers of any other hemispheric nation except Nicaragua.

===Border war with Somoza&#x27;s Nicaragua (1954–1955)===
Figueres&#x27;s support for the Caribbean Legion nearly cost him his job during this second presidency. Implicated in an invasion of Nicaragua in April 1954 by anti-Somoza exiles linked to the Caribbean Legion, Anastasio Somoza García launched a counter-attack, allowing the exiled former Costa Rica president Rafael Calderón to invade Costa Rica in January 1955.

The Nicaraguan dictator withdrew, but not before extracting a commitment from Figueres that he would sever links with the exiles.

===1958 testimony before U.S. Congress===
In 1958, during a visit to Caracas, Venezuela, U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon was spat at by anti-American protesters who also disrupted and assaulted Nixon&#x27;s motorcade, pelting his limousine with rocks, shattering windows, and injuring Venezuela&#x27;s foreign minister. The event prompted the United States Congress to create a special committee to investigate the reasons behind it. Many people were invited to speak before it, including Figueres, who testified on 9 June 1958. Figueres condemned the Venezuelans, but said that he understood them, criticizing the United States for their support of Rafael Trujillo, resource extraction, and enabling of corruption and autocracy.

===Third presidential term (1970–1974)===
The termination of Alliance for Progress funds as well as the collapse of the Central American Common Market, threatened to cripple the country&#x27;s economy until Figueres discovered a new market by selling 30,000 tons of coffee to the Soviet Union in 1972. Costa Rica then became the only Central American nation to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund also delivered millions of dollars to keep the economy afloat.

When opponents of Nicaragua&#x27;s President Anastasio Somoza Debayle seized a plane flying from Managua to Miami and forced it to land in San José in 1971, holding the passengers hostage and demanding fuel for a diverted flight to Cuba, Figueres ordered Costa Rican police to shoot out the engines and tires. The hijackers demanded a new plane in return for the release of hostages, to which Figueres agreed, and the hostages were released; however, when the four hijackers themselves debarked, Figueres met them with 200 armed police, and a shootout ensued in which 2 hijackers were killed. 

By his own account, he also nearly ruined a 1973 Central American summit when he lambasted five army generals, saying, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it odd that all you bastards are generals, and I&#x27;m the only civilian, but I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;s ever fought a war?&quot;

==Political connections==

===KGB===

According to revelations from the Mitrokhin Archive, the KGB secretly transmitted to Figueres a $300,000 loan via the Costa Rican Communist Party to help finance his 1970 campaign, in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, which he did upon election. Figueres later escalated his relationship with the San Jose residency of the KGB, expanding his activities to providing confidential reports on other countries in Central America and the Caribbean.

In 1974, a KGB report to Leonid Brezhnev revealed that Figueres had agreed to publish materials advantageous to the KGB. For this reason, he was given $10,000 under the guise of stock purchases in his newspaper.

===CIA===
Figueres himself acknowledged in 1981 that he had received help from the Central Intelligence Agency, saying, &quot;At the time, I was conspiring against the Latin American dictatorships and wanted help from the United States, I was a good friend of Allen Dulles,&quot; and, &quot;The CIA&#x27;s Cultural Department helped me finance a magazine and some youth conferences here. But I never participated in espionage. I did beg them not to carry out the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba, which was madness, but they ignored me.&quot;

===Relationship with Cuba===
Figueres also opposed the dictatorial regime in pre-Castro Cuba and went so far as to dispatch a planeload of weapons for Cuban insurgents led by the young Fidel Castro, a member of Caribbean Legion. But soon after the 1959 success of the Cuban Revolution, he and Mr. Figueres had a falling out over the growth of Communist influence on the island. In March, 1959, Figueres was invited to Havana, and during a public speech, he warned Castro about the ideological deviations he had observed in Cuba, and immediately the microphone was taken from him. Figueres supported John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress but not the C.I.A.&#x27;s clandestine wars with Cuba.

=== Robert Vesco, fugitive U.S. financier ===
Figueres was stubborn about his blunders, most notably his most controversial decision to grant asylum to Robert Vesco, the fugitive U.S. financier, accused of looting millions of dollars from the Investors Overseas Service, Ltd. (IOS) mutual funds in the 1970s. Mr. Vesco not only had a personal and business relationship with Mr. Figueres but he also made contributions to the campaign coffers of both leading political parties in the 1974 elections. Figueres made it clear, however, that he would not hesitate to extradite Vesco if the United States requested it. Figueres tried to intervene with president Jimmy Carter on Vesco&#x27;s behalf. In the resulting political uproar in Costa Rica, Figueres&#x27; party lost the 1978 presidential election. Mr. Vesco fled Costa Rica after the Presidential elections of 1978 were won by Rodrigo Carazo, who had vowed to expel him.

In an interview in 1981, Figueres said that Vesco had &quot;committed many stupidities&quot; but added:

&quot;I have always defended asylum and would protect him again if I could because I never abandon my friends. The only thing that pains me is that some friends thought I personally benefitted from Vesco.&quot;

Earlier, in a 1973 interview, Figueres said that he had been introduced to Vesco in Costa Rica in 1972 and that Vesco had then arranged for the investment of $2.15 million in Sociedad Agricola Industrial San Cristobal, S.A. The financially troubled company was founded by Figueres and owned by him and others. It had diverse operations in agriculture and its 3,000 employees made it the fourth-largest employer in Costa Rica.

==Career after presidency==
Figueres was well liked and received in many Latin American countries for his center-left ideals. He has been called one of the greatest contributors to social democracy.

After the presidency, as an acknowledged elder statesman, Figueres became a &quot;de facto&quot; ambassador for subsequent administrations.

Figueres backed the left-wing Nicaraguan Revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979. He railed against U.S. policy when the United States supported Nicaragua&#x27;s Contras.

A proposal by his supporters for a fourth presidential term in the 1980s was quickly crushed.

&quot;This is an exemplary little country. We are the example for Latin America&quot;, Figueres told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in a 1986 interview. &quot;In the next century, maybe everyone will be like us.&quot;

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Personal life==
Figueres married Henrietta Boggs from the United States in 1941. They had two children, Muni and José Martí, before the marriage ended in divorce in 1954. He later married Karen Olsen Beck, also from the United States. They had four children: José María, Karen Christiana, Mariano and Kirsten. His wife was a member of the country&#x27;s Legislative Assembly.

He was a good friend of the Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín, praising his political achievements in one of his essays.

His son, José María, also served as president from 1994 to 1998. His daughter, Muni Figueres Boggs, was a former Ambassador from Costa Rica to the United States. His other daughter, Christiana, is a Costa Rican diplomat who served from 2010 to 2016 as the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and is widely considered to be the architect of the Paris Agreement.

<doc id="435874" wikidata="Q4708971" url="?curid=435874" title="Albacore (dinghy)">
<text>The Albacore is a 4.57 m (15 ft) two-person planing dinghy with fractional sloop rig, for competitive racing and lake and near-inshore day sailing. Hulls are made of either wood or fiberglass. The basic shape was developed in 1954 from an Uffa Fox design, the Swordfish. Recent boats retain the same classic dimensions, and use modern materials and modern control systems.

A deep airfoil section centerboard and rudder make the Albacore highly maneuverable. The Albacore&#x27;s rig uses swept spreaders supporting a tapered mast, a powerful vang, and adjustable jib halyard and other sail controls to depower in high winds. This adjustability enables light crews and heavy crews to race head-to-head in all but the most extreme conditions. It does not have a trapeze or spinnaker, and hence avoids the difficult handling of sport boats. The powerful rig and easily driven hull give excellent performance over a wide range of wind and wave conditions.

The 2011 international champion described the Albacore as a boat that is simple to get into at first, but one that will challenge the tuning and tactical skills of a sailor for the rest of their life. Recent champions have been graduates of college sailing teams.

==The First Albacore==
The first Albacore (number 1) was built by Clive Dollery and Dave Lowe, who adapted Uffa Fox&#x27;s design. They were both junior members of the Locks Sailing club in Portsmouth, England (UK) in the 1950s. They crewed in a variety of boats including Lowe&#x27;s National 12, but they were also keen amateur boat builders.

Dollery wanted a boat to race. They wanted to start with a ready made hull. Lowe&#x27;s father and Uffa Fox had discussed and agreed to build a non-standard Flying 25 with significant changes made. So they assumed that the same agreement could be applied to a Swordfish sailing dinghy also designed by Fox.

A Swordfish hull was obtained from Fairey Marine via a local boat builder. They modified the hull moving the position of the mast, cutting a slot and fitting a keel box. Several members of the Locks Sailing club were interested in this project and formed a committee with Fairey Marine, resulting in the &#x27;committee modified Swordfish&#x27;. This was renamed the &#x27;Albacore&#x27;. The committee agreed that this boat be allocated Albacore number 1.

The Locks Sailing club soon had a fleet of about 20 Albacores that raced regularly against one another. In 1958 the National Albacore championships were held under the burgee of the Locks Sailing Club, in Langstone Harbour with a fleet of 46 boats.



==Popularity==
About 8,200 Albacores have been built. The class is actively raced in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Albacores are also used for adult and youth sail training, and for leisure sailing.

The Albacore was ranked 16th most popular one-design sailboat in North America in 2010 by Sailing Anarchy, and 38th most popular in the UK from 2001 to 2011 by Yachts and Yachting.

There is a particularly large concentration of Albacores in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where the Friday night club series sees an average of 45 boats and peaks of over 60 boats on the start line every Friday during the summer sailing season.

Older Albacores are commonly found in vacation areas such as Ontario Cottage country.

==Competitions==
The Albacore class offers an active racing program, attracting experienced sailors as well as new enthusiasts. With local club racing, regional regattas, and international championships, the class provides racing opportunities for every level of experience and interest. In addition, Albacores compete with other boats in a mixed fleet by means of the Portsmouth Yardstick handicap scheme. Its Portsmouth number is 1062 and its D-PN is 90.3.

The Class has a biannual International (World) Championship with the venue alternating between the three key countries where the class is sailed. The earliest such event was in 1971, and was won by Canadians Jack Langmaid and Nancy Langmaid in a Fairey Marine Albacore.

Recent International events:
The next International Championship is scheduled to take place in the USA in 2025.

==Manufacture==
Two manufacturers of Albacores produced boats in 2011 to 2013: Ovington Boats in the UK and Hapco Marine in the USA. The boats were primarily delivered to UK, Canadian and US destinations.

Notable earlier manufacturers include Ontario Yachts, Skene, Woof, Kingsfield Marine, Fairey Marine, Grampian Marine, McGruer&amp;Clarke, JD Young, Rondar, Lockley, Lockley-Newport, and Whitby Boat Works.
The first fiberglass version of the boat was made by Whitby Boat Works and sold as the Albatross. Shortly thereafter, fiberglass version of the Albacore appeared.

==Family use==
The hull weight of an Albacore is 109 kg (240 lbs). Therefore, the Albacore can be road-trailered, with 1 or 2 Albacores behind a typical family car. With appropriate road-trailer design, the boat can be loaded and unloaded using only 2 people.

The Albacore is frequently used as a first boat for those who are just learning to sail, and as a very competitive racer for more advanced sailors.

Regatta results show that this class of boat is often sailed by husband/wife and parent/child combinations, and that some of the all-women teams are the most competitive in the class.

==Rigging and Materials==
All Albacores ever made are considered identical for the purpose of racing, and can race together without a handicap. However, many details and materials be improved or modified at the choice of the individual owner or manufacturer, provided that the basic dimensions and materials meet the class specification.

The rigging of early Albacores was very simple, including such basic features as a flat centerboard and fixed jib fairleads. This rigging allowed only limited adjustability of sails.

Modern Albacore designs have evolved sophisticated control systems for their running rigging and standing rigging. This greatly increases their versatility compared to earlier boats, and they can be sailed in 2 knots to 25 knots of wind.

A typical modern design for an Albacore includes:
* Epoxy foam sandwich fibreglass hull (Modern wood hulls are also manufactured, but are less common)
* Tapered aluminum mast
* Lightweight aluminum boom
* Automatic fly-away jib stick
* Moulded or wood/fiberglass composite centerboard with symmetric airfoil cross-section
* Kick-up rudder with symmetric airfoil cross-section
* Suction self-bailers (which empty a boat after capsize in 4 minutes)
* Adjustable continuous 16:1 vang and 12:1 jib halyard, rigged to side control panel
* 4:1 main-sail outhaul, 2:1 main-sail Cunningham, jib Cunningham
* Adjustable hiking straps for crew and helm
* Extended jib tracks for high- &amp; low-aspect jibs
* Split-tail mainsheet
* Deck mounted 6:1 mast pre-bend adjuster and 2:1 rope mast ram

<text>Elim Fellowship is a Finished Work Pentecostal denomination of Christianity. It was founded in 1933 in Lima, New York, United States. It is named for a biblical location named in Exodus 15:27, wherein Elim is described as an oasis in the wilderness.

Elim Fellowship&#x27;s headquarters is located at 1703 Dalton Road, Lima, New York, US and it has churches across the US and Canada.

== History ==

Elim Bible Institute was founded in 1924 by Reverend Ivan Q. Spencer and his wife Minnie Spencer in Hornell, New York. The Spencers had a vision to train ministers to work in revival and renewal movements.

The Elim Fellowship began a few years later in 1933 as the Elim Ministerial Fellowship, an informal fellowship of ministers who had graduated from Elim Bible Institute. In 1947, this loose network was incorporated as Elim Missionary Assemblies. In 1972 the name &quot;Elim Fellowship&quot; was officially adopted.

Elim, describes itself as a &quot;worldwide revival fellowship&quot;, and works to serve, support, and network pastors, missionaries, churches, and other ministers and ministries.

The Elim Fellowship of Evangelical Churches and Ministers in Canada was incorporated in 1982.

== Beliefs ==

According to the denomination&#x27;s official Statement of Faith, Elim Fellowship believes that;
* the Holy Bible is the divinely inspired word of God; 
* that God exists eternally as one being of three co-equal persons; 
* that humankind is lost and in need of a savior; 
* that eternal salvation comes through the atoning death of Jesus Christ and spiritual regeneration by the Holy Spirit; 
* that divine healing is provided through atonement; 
* and that the personal bodily return of Jesus Christ is imminent.

The fellowship describes itself as being &quot;of Pentecostal conviction and Charismatic orientation&quot;. Church government is congregational. The decision making body of the fellowship is the Council of Elders. New elders are chosen by the existing elder body and affirmed in annual session.

The Elim Fellowship holds membership in the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, the National Association of Evangelicals, Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America, and the International Pentecostal Association.

<text>Francisco José Orlich Bolmarcich (10 March 190729 October 1969) was the 34th President of Costa Rica from 1962 to 1966. He was an ethnic Croat, a descendant of Croatian settlers from the town of Punat on the island of Krk, Croatia. 

Together with his brothers he founded in 1928 FJ Orlich &amp; Hnos Ltda. (FJ Orlich &amp; Brothers Limited). At first a large supply store in his hometown of San Ramón, this eventually grew to become one of Costa Rica&#x27;s largest coffee firms. His half-brother, Franjo J. Orlich, the namesake of the firm, moved from Costa Rica to Pennsylvania and worked for Bethlehem Steel as a Pattern Maker in the Castings Plant. A long-time friend of José Figueres Ferrer, with whom he had traveled together to study in the United States, Orlich was Figueres&#x27; second in command within the National Liberation Army in the Costa Rican Civil War.

Following that, the National Liberation Party was founded in the Orlich family farm in La Paz, San Ramón. He twice served as Public Works Minister (1948–1949, 1953–1957) in Figueres&#x27; cabinets. Afterwards he ran for president in 1958, but lost to Mario Echandi Jiménez. He ran again in 1962, against the defeated 1948 leader Dr Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, and won the presidency.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution.

As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

During his presidency he faced the major eruption of the Irazú volcano, that started just as U.S. President John F. Kennedy was visiting Costa Rica and lasted for over a year, causing major agricultural damage and landslides in the city of Cartago.

==Death==
He died of a stroke on 29 October 1969 in San José, at the age of 62. As of , his widow, Marita Camacho Quirós, is years old. This makes her the oldest living and longest-lived person in Costa Rica and the oldest former First Lady in the world.

<doc id="435880" wikidata="Q7310060" url="?curid=435880" title="Reies Tijerina">
<text>Reies López Tijerina (September 21, 1926 – January 19, 2015), was an activist who led a struggle in the 1960s and 1970s to restore New Mexican land grants to the descendants of their Spanish colonial and Mexican owners. As a vocal spokesman for the rights of Hispanos and Mexican Americans, he became a major figure of the early Chicano Movement (although he preferred &quot;Indohispano&quot; as a name for his people) and founded the Alianza Federal de Mercedes. As an activist, he worked in community education and organization, media relations, and land reclamations. He became famous and infamous internationally for his 1967 armed raid on the Tierra Amarilla courthouse located on the Tierra Amarilla Land Grant whose lands, originally designated for Hispanic settlers, had largely been acquired by Anglo ranchers and land developers. 

==Early life==
Born in Falls City, Texas in 1926, Tijerina spent several years as a pastor starting in 1950 and later as an itinerant preacher.

==Career==
===Kingdom of God===
In 1956, Tijerina and 17 families of his followers sought to purchase land in Texas on which to create their version of the Kingdom of God. Finding Texas land too expensive, they opted for 160 acres (647,497 square meters) in the Southern Arizona desert, which they bought with $1,400 in pooled funds. Situated just north of the Papago Tohono O&#x27;odham Indian reservation, the land was secluded and undeveloped, the perfect conditions for a community seeking to remove itself from the &quot;vanity and corruption&quot; of the cities. They especially sought to protect their children from the influence of public schooling.

At first, the families, referred to as &quot;los Bravos&quot; or the &quot;Heralds of Peace&quot;, lived under trees, but they soon dug themselves shelters, covering them with automobile hoods recovered from garbage dumps outside the cities of Casa Grande and Eloy. Tijerina obtained a permit from the Arizona Department of Education to construct a school and to educate their children. He and the other men spent three months building the schoolhouse, only for it to be burned to the ground.

The members of the colony made friends with the neighboring communities, especially African Americans and Native Americans, particularly the Pima Indians. Tijerina soon found himself thrust into the role of bail bondsman for these minority communities. Officials from the Pima County school board began visiting the Valley of Peace early in the year, encouraging the settlers to send their children to public schools. Citing the recent rape and murder of a local eight-year-old girl who was waiting for the bus, Tijerina and the other parents requested police protection for their children, which was denied. As a result, the commune-dwellers retained the right to educate their own children.

On April 18, 1956, Tijerina delivered his daughter Ira de Alá, the first person to be born in the colony. He chose the name &quot;Ira de Alá&quot;, literally &quot;Wrath of Allah&quot;, because he &quot;knew that if there was a just God, he had to be angry and unhappy with those that managed our government and religion here on Earth&quot;. During the first year, a jet crashed on the property. Valley of Peace residents reported the crash, and officials came to take away the remains but neglected to ask about the condition of the property or the residents. Not long after the crash, a group of Anglo-American youths rode their horses over the tops of the settlers&#x27; subterranean homes, damaging them. Thinking that the pranks were but youthful mischief, the commune members simply repaired their dwellings and made no complaint. But shortly thereafter, they returned from work in the cotton fields to discover two residences destroyed by fire. Tijerina and two other men went to file a report with Sheriff Lawrence White. But when White found out the direction from which the horse tracks came, he refused to investigate. Don Pelkam, an FBI agent stationed in Casa Grande who had investigated the crash, also refused to investigate, claiming that the arson had occurred outside his jurisdiction.

Shortly after his daughter was born, a storm flooded the Valley of Peace. Devastated by his losses, Tijerina could not sleep. During the night he had a vision:

Following the vision, Tijerina felt that his life had purpose and direction, and his experience, which he interpreted as divine, gave him an unwavering conviction.

In the early 1950s, Tijerina was first encouraged to divert his religious energy into politics. After a sermon in Dallas one day, a man invited him home for lunch. As Tijerina recalls, &quot;He said to my face, &#x27;I don&#x27;t like preachers, they take advantage of the people. What I think you should do is quit talking religion. What the Spanish-American people need is a Spanish-American politician, you may be that ... you should study law and history and help your people.&#x27;&quot; In June 1956, Tijerina and a few &quot;bravos&quot; went to Monero, New Mexico, to visit a community that had previously welcomed him. There he learned about land grants, a controversial issue regarding Hispanic property rights. Zebedeo Martínez, Zebedeo Valdez, and other elderly men, all members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, shared the story of how their families were dispossessed of their lands. The next day, they took Tijerina&#x27;s group to Chama, Tierra Amarilla, and Ensenada to meet with other unhappy heirs.

Tijerina empathized with their plight, and offered to do what he could to help them, on the condition that they unite to &quot;re-gather the strength that the Anglos had taken from&quot; them. But when he discovered that they held no titles to the land, having been turned over to Governor William Anderson Pile in the late nineteenth century, he resolved to go to Mexico to study the issue.

He left in the fall of 1956 and stayed in Mexico until the new year, researching at the General National Archive and meeting with lawyers and other influential people. One of the most important documents he studied was the Laws of the Indies, which had governed the American portion of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. Another was a re-drafted version of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo containing a protocol that guaranteed land grants to descendants of the original grantees, which he obtained in the Tepito barrio for twenty-five cents. On this trip to Mexico, Tijerina realized that the biggest obstacle to his success was &quot;the fear the Anglo had placed in [the land grant-heirs&#x27;] hearts through their foreign education.&quot; While education had been a key factor in the founding of the Valley of Peace, it now took on an even more important dimension in the life of Tijerina and in the struggle for the land.

In January 1957, officials from the Arizona State Department of Education threatened Tijerina and the other parents with jail time if they did not send their children to public school. Even when confronted with the Supreme Court cases defending the right to home-schooling, the officials would not back down. Tijerina claims to have later found out that the real reason for the harassment was &quot;Rockefeller money was planning to build a model city about a mile from the Valley of Peace.&quot; As a last resort, Tijerina took his case to the Phoenix press. However, neither of the two major papers covered the story of the persecution.

On March 19 of the same year, Tijerina was charged with the grand theft of six feed-trailer wheels. The case was thrown out for lack of evidence, but the next month, he was charged with another theft, this time for hardware discovered in the Valley of Peace. During the investigation, officials found out that Margarito Tijerina, who had joined the commune, was wanted in Indiana and took him into custody.

Reies was accused of being the getaway driver during a failed attempt to free his brother from Pinal County Jail. During a recess at his hearing, he left the courthouse, becoming a fugitive.

Tijerina and the other families with children sought refuge in New Mexico. They arrived in the ghost town of Gobernador in early 1957 and took refuge in a church. Desperate for food, Tijerina and his brother Margarito set out to find help. They met Don Manuel Trujillo, a local rancher. Tijerina later called Trujillo his &quot;first and best teacher on the question of land grants in New Mexico.&quot; In New Mexico, Tijerina got the idea to organize the heirs of the New Mexico land grants into a corporation that could compete with &quot;the great corporations of the Anglos&quot;. But realizing that survival came first, Tijerina and two other &quot;bravos&quot; returned to the Valley of Peace to look for work. They were arrested and imprisoned in Florence, Arizona for ninety days. Margarito, who had violated the conditions of his parole, was not released. While in prison, Margarito asked Tijerina to help the wife and child of a fellow inmate. Commune members clothed and fed the woman and child, and Tijerina secured the man&#x27;s release. Two days later, he was imprisoned and charged with attempting to free his brother. Released on bond, his court-appointed attorney urged him to flee the state for his own safety. After consulting with the other families, Tijerina decided to risk losing the Valley of Peace and flee.

Tijerina spent the next seven years as a fugitive in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. By this time he had seven children and had to leave them with his wife. While on the run, Tijerina continued to research communal land rights, the U.S. Constitution, and the rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The biggest weakness he saw in U.S. law was its failure to provide specific protection for the family.

In May 1958, he was invited to speak in front of a group of land grant heirs in Chama, New Mexico. During his speech, he was attacked and struck over the head with a club. In the ensuing melee, Tijerina was removed to safety and his brother, Anselmo, was arrested for assaulting Tijerina&#x27;s attacker.

In 1959, Tijerina went to an archive in Guadalajara, Jalisco. When he requested the documents concerning the New Mexican land claims, the attendant was unable to locate them. His nephew from Pleasanton Texas then hid the files in his house in the closet. The last person to access the documents was an American commissioned by the Mexican government to convert them to microfilm.

The authorities came close to apprehending Tijerina many times, and he was maligned in the local press as a &quot;Communist&quot; and a &quot;bandit&quot;. In September 1959, he organized a strike in Shamrock, Texas, in protest of unequal working conditions for Mexican laborers. When thus confronted, the cotton farmer gave in to the strikers&#x27; demands.

Tijerina secured housing in Ensenada, New Mexico, where he came into further contact with members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, who told him of Thomas B. Catron&#x27;s leadership of the Santa Fe Ring, a group of ranchers, and government officials who systematically dispossessed the land grantees and their heirs of their claims from 1848 until 1904. He also became aware that the federal government itself had claimed portions of the Tierra Amarilla grant in the name of the Forest Service.

When Tijerina&#x27;s brother Margarito was released from prison in Michigan City, Tijerina took advantage of the opportunity to meet with Elijah Muhammad. They met daily over the course of a week, during which time they discussed the need for unity among the minority groups of the United States.

On December 12, 1959, Tijerina sent a letter signed by some eighty families asking President Eisenhower to investigate the land claims. Two months later, they received a cold response. Having failed to receive redress of their grievance from one signatory of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Tijerina and his supporters turned to the government of Mexico. His goal was to deliver a 500-signature petition, historical documents, and legal opinions to President Adolfo López Mateos. Arriving in Mexico City, Tijerina made the acquaintance of the labor leader Vicente Lombardo Toledano, who listened patiently to the story of the struggle of &quot;the forgotten community&quot; over the land, and offered to do what he could for the price of $25,000. Having failed to reach López Mateos via Toledano, he turned to other acquaintances in the religious and academic communities. But before he could meet with the president, his documents were stolen during a visit to the post office. Devastated, Tijerina returned to the United States, along with his nephew Johnny Tijerina.

He returned to Mexico in late 1961 and succeeded in obtaining an audience with General Lázaro Cárdenas. The General offered his support, but warned auspiciously, &quot;if you are not willing to see blood spilt, forget about all of this.&quot;

===La Alianza===
In August 1962, while living in Albuquerque, Tijerina drafted the first plan of the Alianza Federal de Mercedes. A letter calling for an Alianza of Pueblos and Pobladores (Alliance of Towns and Settlers) followed soon afterwards in October. La Alianza, as it became known, was officially incorporated on February 2, 1963, the 115th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Tijerina was elected president and Eduardo Chávez was elected vice-president. The Alianza sought &quot;to organize and acquaint the heirs of all Spanish land-grants covered by the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty&quot; with their rights. The group further sought to foster pride the heritage of the Native New Mexicans and to command Anglo respect on their behalf. The Alianza began publishing a newspaper, and Tijerina wrote a weekly column for &quot;The News Chieftain. In June 1963, the Alianza sent letters to the governments of the United States and Mexico reminding them of their obligations under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

At the same time, Tijerina&#x27;s fugitive lifestyle was taking its toll on his family life. He and his wife discussed divorce as a possible solution to their problems at the beginning of 1963, which she obtained later in the year.

It was also at this time that the local press gave Tijerina the nickname of Don Quixote, belittling his quest to restore the property rights of land grant heirs. By 1964 the Alianza had over 6,000 members; a year later, its membership had increased to 14,000. At its 1966 convention, the Alianza counted 20,000 people in its fold. Nevertheless, the Alianza&#x27;s activities raised the ire of many New Mexican Hispanics, who saw Tijerina as an outsider who had come to upset the status quo. For example, U.S. Senator Joseph Montoya, spoke out against Tijerina and the Alianza, stating that &quot;the last thing the Spanish-speaking need is agitation, rabble-rousing, or creation of false hopes,&quot; and characterized Tijerina as an &quot;outsider who sparked violence and set back racial relations and an enemy of the United States.&quot;

To promote the cause of the Alianza, Tijerina began planning an automobile caravan to Mexico. While laying the groundwork in Mexico, he was detained and deported by Mexican officials. The insult crushed the hopes of many Alianzistas that Mexico would bring their case to the United Nations, and led Tijerina to suspect that the FBI was behind the deportation.

On April 1, 1965, Tijerina began broadcasting the daily radio program &quot;The Voice of Justice&quot;. The 5,000 watt station, KABQ-FM, provided &quot;the best medium to reach the community about the issue of the land.&quot; In August 1965, he adapted the show to a televised format.

Tijerina&#x27;s single status had begun to cause him trouble as the leader of a family-based organization, but his attempts to reconcile with his wife failed. On August 8, 1965, he met Patricia, and the two were wed on September 25.

===March on Santa Fe and the taking of San Joaquín===
In 1966, Tijerina went to Spain and learned a great deal about the Spanish laws governing land grants. When he returned, he planned a July 4 protest march from Albuquerque to Santa Fe called &quot;the Spanish American March for a Redress of Grievances.&quot; On the march, some white New Mexicans shouted epithets at them. Some even shot at them. Arriving in the capital, they met with the governor and delivered a written demand for an investigation into the theft of the communal land holdings.

Failed attempts to petition the government for redress of grievances led the Alianza to take direct action. In October 1966, Alianza members occupied part of the &quot;Echo Amphitheater Park,&quot; part of the Carson National Forest that had been part of the San Joaquín del Río de Chama grant. The Alianza set up and proclaimed the &quot;Republic of San Joaquín del Río de Chama.&quot; Descendants of the original settlers elected officials, and, according to some accounts, issued visas to passing tourists. When two forest rangers attempted to remove the occupiers, they were arrested by the newly elected marshals. The rangers were tried, convicted of trespassing, given suspended sentences, and released along with their trucks.

After five days, the claimants turned themselves in. Of the 300 people involved, only five—Tijerina, his brother Cristóbal and three other Alianza members—were charged with assault on the Rangers and converting government property to personal use. Bail in the amount of $5,000 each was imposed.

===Courthouse raid===
Released on bond, Tijerina called a meeting of the Alianza in the village of Coyote. On June 3, 1967, District Attorney Alfonso Sánchez ordered police to disband the meeting, alleging that the Alianza was inspired by communists and outside agitators, and had the state police set up roadblocks to arrest Alianza members. During the meeting, eleven Aliancistas were taken into custody. Tijerina and several members managed to avoid arrest and met near the town of Canjilón, where the Alianza condemned the arrests as illegal acts.

On June 5, 1967, Tijerina led an armed raid on the Rio Arriba County courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, to free the imprisoned members and to place a citizen&#x27;s arrest on Sánchez for violating the Alianza&#x27;s right of peaceable assembly in Coyote two days prior. Unbeknownst to Tijerina, the county judge had already freed the imprisoned members while Sánchez himself was not present at the courthouse that day. In the ensuing confrontation, Eulogio Salazar, a prison guard, was shot and Daniel Rivera, a sheriff&#x27;s deputy, was badly injured. The Aliancistas headed for the mountains of Canjilón with two abductees.

Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico E. Lee Francis ordered the National Guard out as well as a large array of law enforcement agencies, including state police from all the northern counties, local sheriffs and unofficial posses, Jicarilla Apache police, and cattle inspectors, to arrest all members of the Alianza involved in the incident, thus launching the biggest manhunt in New Mexico history. In a crude translation of his name, the press dubbed Tijerina &quot;King Tiger&quot;. &quot;The Ballad of Río Arriba&quot;, a corrido based on the raid written by Roberto Martínez, received heavy radio play. The next Monday, Tijerina surrendered to authorities in Albuquerque and was charged with fifty-four criminal counts including kidnapping and armed assault.

The courthouse raid caught the attention of the national press and brought Tijerina&#x27;s regional land grant crusade into the larger Chicano and civil rights movements. He met with activists from around the country such as Rodolfo Gonzales, the founder of the Denver-based Chicano organization, La Cruzada por Justicia. At his trial, Tijerina defended himself with the help of two court-appointed lawyers. He was convicted of assault with intent to commit a violent felony (intent to kill or to commit mayhem) and of false imprisonment. He appealed his conviction to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, who certified the case to the New Mexico Supreme Court. His convictions were affirmed. Las Cruces was the venue for the San Joaquín trial. Forbidden from discussing the history of the land grant, Tijerina was ultimately convicted of destruction of federal property and assault on a federal officer and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment.

===Poor People&#x27;s Campaign===
In March 1968, Tijerina was elected to lead the Chicano contingent of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference&#x27;s (SCLC) Poor People&#x27;s March on Washington. Despite stunning setbacks, including the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the president of the SCLC, and the April 25 bombing of Tijerina&#x27;s Albuquerque home, the SCLC was undeterred. Under the leadership of new SCLC president Ralph Abernathy, the march proceeded as planned, on May 2, 1968. Tijerina, with three busloads from New Mexico, met up with the Corky Gonzales-led Hispanic contingency from Colorado, the Alicia Escalante-led contingency from Los Angeles, the Reverend Nieto-led contingency from Texas, and a group of Puerto Ricans from New York. Together, they convened in &quot;Resurrection City&quot; with the African American factions led by Coretta Scott King and Abernathy. Tijerina insisted that the Native American delegations spearhead the march and be the first to demand justice, a proposal that had been approved during the original planning meeting with Dr. King. But when it came time to march, Abernathy&#x27;s followers resisted the idea. Much was made of this &quot;rift&quot; in the mainstream press, which claimed that Tijerina insisted that the Hispanic delegation go first. En route to D.C., a group of Native Americans who were accompanied by Dick Gregory were detained by Washington State police. In protest, Tijerina organized a demonstration in front of the United States Supreme Court building on May 29. Police brutalized the demonstrators, but eventually, twenty delegates were permitted to meet with John Davis, the clerk of the court. The following month, leaders met with Secretary of State Dean Rusk. On June 23, 1969, the day that Warren E. Burger was sworn in as Chief Justice, Tijerina returned to Washington to place him under citizen&#x27;s arrest. As he waited outside the Senate chamber, Burger never exited. He had dodged the arrest by exiting out a back door.

Supporters of Tijerina formed the People&#x27;s Constitutional Party in 1968.

===Trial and incarceration===
In early 1970, Tijerina was sentenced to prison for charges related to the 1967 Tierra Amarilla courthouse raid. The presiding judge, Garnett Burkes, denied defense claims of double jeopardy. A team of four lawyers spent eighteen months preparing the case, but on the opening day of the trial, Tijerina dismissed them, opting to defend himself. He was charged with the false imprisonment and assault of Daniel Rivera. Rivera, the prosecution&#x27;s star witness, admitted under Tijerina&#x27;s cross-examination that he neither knew federal civil rights laws, nor had he been trained in how to protect peoples&#x27; civil rights. He also testified that Tijerina was not to blame for the events at Tierra Amarilla. &quot;The Albuquerque Tribune&quot; compared Tijerina&#x27;s courtroom performance with Clarence Darrow&#x27;s. Dr. Frances Swadesh, a University of Colorado anthropologist, testified that Anglos had used force and legal maneuvers to steal the land. Tijerina based his closing argument on Article 6, Section two of the Constitution, which obligates the government to comply with the terms of international treaties, i.e., the protection of the property rights of land-grantees as provided by articles 8 and 9 of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He continued to assert his constitutional right to place a citizen&#x27;s arrest on the law enforcement officers who, by their own admission, were ignorant of the law and had violated the Alianza&#x27;s right of free assembly.

Tijerina was sentenced to two years in a federal prison. He was incarcerated in La Tuna, Texas, where he shared a cell with Joe Valachi. Suspecting a plot to poison him and blame the mafia, Tijerina refused to eat, preferring scraps saved by fellow Mexican prisoners.

At one point, he was transferred to Albuquerque, where he shared a cell with 25-year-old Walter Payton, a member of the white militia the Minutemen, who had been arrested by the FBI on weapons charges after five tons of weapons and ammunition were discovered near Truth or Consequences. When Payton learned that &quot;King Tiger&quot; was being held in the same facility, he told the authorities not to put them together, swearing he would kill Tijerina if he saw him. Prison officials promptly locked them in the same cell. But when the two talked peacefully for more than four hours, Payton was transferred out of the cell.

In 1970 Tijerina was transferred to a mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri. His exposure to the mentally ill combined with his historical research crystallized his concept of &quot;Anglo psychopathy&quot;:

I believe the origins of the Anglo psychopathy began when the English were excluded from the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed June 7, 1494, between Spain and Portugal. The treaty was brokered by the Pope. It was at this time that the Anglo not only rejected the legitimate body of the era, but also the religion that went against them. The Anglo, without respect for authority and religion, and to get back into the colonization game, legalized piracy. They had to operate outside the law to become the law. Over the last 480 years, the Anglo complex of psychopathy has worsened. His conscience tortures him, and his thinking grows demented for having violated his own religion, his own law, and humanity.

It was also in the mental hospital that Tijerina began focusing on a &quot;solution for peace among humanity&quot; and found a new goal: &quot;to promote fraternity and harmony among human beings.&quot;

One of the terms of his 1971 release was that he not hold any leadership in the Alianza. Nonetheless, Tijerina continued to advocate for land rights, for human unity, and for an investigation into the death of Eulogio Salazar. The League of United Latin American Citizens lent their support to the land grant cause in 1972 after the publication of a supportive report in the &quot;Tribune&quot;. But in spite of the new invigoration of the movement,
little progress was made outside of the sphere of public awareness.

On June 29, 1974, Tijerina began his second prison term. During his incarceration he came into contact with Blas Chávez, a World War II veteran who had been involved in New Mexico politics and ended up out of favor with the powerful. He told Tijerina of the corrupt dealings of Senator Joseph Montoya and other politicians, as well as the details behind the murder of Eulogio Salazar.

==Later years==
He lived in El Paso, Texas after about a year in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico where he moved in April 2006. After a fire claimed his New Mexico house in 1994, Tijerina moved to Uruapan, Michoacán, where he married for the third time. He presented his archival materials to the University of New Mexico on October 19, 1999. On November 5 of the same year, he met with senior staff of then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush&#x27;s administration about land issues. A translation of his memoirs, previously only available in a 1978 Spanish version published by Mexico&#x27;s Fondo de Cultura Económica, was published in 2000.

He died in El Paso, aged 88, on January 19, 2015.

<doc id="435881" wikidata="Q488684" url="?curid=435881" title="Waveform monitor">
<text>A waveform monitor is a special type of oscilloscope used in television production applications. It is typically used to measure and display the level, or voltage, of a video signal with respect to time.

The level of a video signal usually corresponds to the brightness, or luminance, of the part of the image being drawn onto a regular video screen at the same point in time. A waveform monitor can be used to display the overall brightness of a television picture, or it can zoom in to show one or two individual lines of the video signal. It can also be used to visualize and observe special signals in the vertical blanking interval of a video signal, as well as the colorburst between each line of video.

Waveform monitors are used for the following purposes:

* To assist with the calibration of professional video cameras, and to &quot;line up&quot; multiple-camera setups being used at the same location in order to ensure that the same scene shot under the same conditions will produce the same results.
* As a tool to assist in telecine (film-to-tape transfer), color correction, and other video production activities
* To monitor video signals to make sure that neither the color gamut, nor the analog transmission limits, are violated.
* To diagnose and troubleshoot a television studio, or the equipment located therein.
* To assist with installation of equipment into a television facility, or with the commissioning or certification of a facility.
* In manufacturing test and research and development applications.
* For setting camera exposure in the case of video and digital cinema cameras.

A waveform monitor is often used in conjunction with a vectorscope. Originally, these were separate devices; however modern waveform monitors include vectorscope functionality as a separate mode. (The combined device is simply called a &quot;waveform monitor&quot;).

Originally, waveform monitors were entirely analog devices; the incoming (analog) video signal was filtered and amplified, and the resulting voltage was used to drive the vertical axis of a cathode-ray tube. A sync stripper circuit was used to isolate the sync pulses and colorburst from the video signal; the recovered sync information was fed to a sweep circuit which drove the horizontal axis. Early waveform monitors differed little from oscilloscopes, except for the specialized video trigger circuitry. Waveform monitors also permit the use of external reference; in this mode the sync and burst signals are taken from a separate input (thus allowing all devices in a facility to be genlocked, or synchronized to the same timing source).

With the advent of digital television and digital signal processing, the waveform monitor acquired many new features and capabilities. Modern waveform monitors contain many additional modes of operation, including &quot;picture mode&quot; (where the video picture is simply presented on the screen, much like a television), various modes optimized for color gamut checking, support for the audio portion of a television program (either embedded with the video, or on separate inputs), eye pattern and jitter displays for measuring the physical layer parameters of serial-digital television formats, modes for examining the serial digital protocol layer, and support for ancillary data and television-related metadata such as timecode, closed captions and the v-chip rating systems.

Modern waveform monitors and other oscilloscopes have largely abandoned old-style CRT technology as well. All new waveform monitors are based on a &quot;rasterizer&quot;, a piece of graphics hardware that duplicates the behavior of a CRT vector display, generating a raster signal. They may come with a flat-panel liquid crystal display, or they may be sold without a display, in which case the user can connect any VGA display.

<text>John Alfred Gambling (February 5, 1930 – January 8, 2004) was an American radio personality. He was a member of the Gambling family, three generations of whom - John B., John A. and John R. - were hosts of WOR Radio&#x27;s (New York City, 710 AM) morning show &quot;Rambling with Gambling&quot; (now known as &quot;The John Gambling Show&quot;) over the course of more than 75 years (1925–2000 and 2008–2013). He is the author of &quot;Rambling with Gambling&quot; published in 1972.

&quot;Rambling With Gambling&quot; was listed in the Guinness World Records of 2003 as the &quot;world&#x27;s longest-running radio show;&quot; a record since surpassed by the Grand Ole Opry. The program offered the first on-air broadcast of school closings and helicopter traffic reports. In a smooth baritone, Gambling also interviewed celebrities, politicians, and other newsworthy people.

Gambling graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1947 where he played on its football team, and from Dartmouth College in 1951. He grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey where his father owned a home. &quot;Mane good people came to live in the township, among them Ferde Grofe, composer of &quot;The Grand Canyon Suite&quot; and other fine music. The senior John Gambling of WOR lived in Teaneck with his wife and his son John. The family later moved to Manhasset, New York, Long Island.

John A. Gambling was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2000. John A. was the host from 1959 to 1991. From 1985 to 1991, John R. was his co-host.

Gambling died of heart failure at a hospital in Venice, Florida.

<doc id="435887" wikidata="Q982090" url="?curid=435887" title="Efren Reyes">
<text>Efren Manalang Reyes (born August 26, 1954) is a Filipino professional pool player. A winner of over 100 international titles, Reyes was the first player to win world championships in two different pool disciplines. Among his numerous titles, Reyes is a four-time World Eight-ball champion, the 1999 WPA World Nine-ball Championship winner, a three-time U.S. Open winner, a two-time World Pool League champion, a four-time All Japan Championship winner, a seven-time Asian Nine-ball Tour champion, and a thirteen-time Derby City Classic winner. Reyes also represented the Philippines at the World Cup of Pool, winning the event with partner Francisco Bustamante in 2006 and 2009. By defeating American player Earl Strickland in the inaugural The Color of Money event in 1997, Reyes took home the largest single match purse in pool history of $100,000. Many analysts, fans and players consider Reyes to be the greatest pool player of all time.

Reyes is nicknamed &quot;The Magician&quot;—for his ability on the pool table—and &quot;&quot;, to distinguish from a fellow pool player by the same name. In addition to pool, Reyes has played international billiards, specifically one-cushion and three-cushion.

== Early life ==
Reyes was born in Pampanga, Philippines, on August 26, 1954. He moved to Manila at age five to live with his uncle, who owned a pool hall. He cleaned the hall and slept on the tables. Because Reyes was not tall enough to reach the pool table, he played while standing on Coca-Cola cases that he moved around.

Gambling from a young age, he won his first match for money aged nine and continued to compete at three-cushion billiards in the 1960s and 1970s. After establishing himself as a winner, he was discovered by promoters. This gave him the opportunity to compete in larger tournaments.

==Career==
In 1983, Reyes took on Pepito Dacer in the finals of the Philippine Rotation Championship. The finals were played in race-to-39 and the players competed over 11 racks on a weekly basis. On the seventh week of play, Reyes defeated Dacer 39–32. During the 1980s, when Reyes was considered a top-class player in his homeland but not yet internationally recognized, he went to the United States to hustle. Reyes claims to have earned $80,000 in a single week, making him a folk hero back in the Philippines.

Reyes began winning a number of tournaments in the United States, Europe and parts of Asia, garnering attention and recognition worldwide. At the start of his career, he used aliases such as &quot;Cesar Morales&quot; to hide his identity so he would be allowed to compete. Reyes became internationally known at the U.S. Open 9-Ball Championship in 1994. Having finished third in 1985, he defeated Nick Varner in the finals and became the first non-American to win the event.

Two years later, Reyes and Earl Strickland were chosen to compete in an event, named after the recently released The Color of Money movie. The event was a three-day race-to-120 challenge match of nine-ball. It was held in Hong Kong, with a winner-take-all prize of $100,000. Reyes won the match 120–117 despite being 17 racks behind, to win the all-time largest purse in any professional pool event. In 1999, Reyes won the first televised World Pool Championship that was hosted by Matchroom Pool, earning $60,000, which was the largest first-place prize in a pool tournament. At the time, the tournament was not recognized by the World Pool-Billiard Association, which ran their own event, although they later acknowledged the event was an official World Championship. This made Reyes the second Filipino player after Jose Parica to win a world championship in pocket billiards. In 2001, Reyes participated in the 2001 Tokyo 9-Ball Open, the event had over 700 players participating. Reyes won the event, beating Niels Feijen in the finals 15–7 and earning $163,000 first prize. At the time, this was the largest first prize in a pool tournament.
Reyes won the 2002 International Challenge of Champions, defeating Mika Immonen in a . He reached the final of the 2004 WPA World Eight-ball Championship, where he met Marlon Manalo in the final. He trailed 0–4, but won eight straight racks and won the final 11–8. The win made Reyes the first player to win WPA world championships in more than one discipline.

Reyes won the 2005 International Pool Tour King of the Hill Eight-ball Shootout, winning $200,000, which was the largest first-place prize of any pool tournament at the time. In the final, he met Mike Sigel in a best-of-three sets match, winning 8–0 in the first set and 8–5 in the second. The following year, Reyes won the IPT World Open Eight-ball Championship over Rodney Morris 8–6, earning $500,000. However, due to IPT&#x27;s financial problems, he has not been able to claim this sum.

Reyes partnered with Francisco Bustamante to represent the Philippines at the inaugural World Cup of Pool. They reached the 2006 final, where they met Earl Strickland and Rodney Morris representing the United States. They won seven consecutive racks to win the final 13–5. He also won the 2009 event once again partnering Bustamante. The pair met the German team of Ralf Souquet and Thorsten Hohmann in the final and won 11–9.

As of 2019, Reyes is still actively competing in professional pool. Overall, he is the most successful player at the Derby City Classic, having won the overall championship on five occasions. He has also won five bronze medals at the Southeast Asian Games and an eight-ball bronze medal at the 2002 Asian Games.

==Media and persona==
Reyes is known for his highly creative play. Reyes is often called by his nickname &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;kid&quot; in Filipino, given to him by close friends to distinguish him from an older Efren who also played pool. Reyes&#x27; ability to play led to his gaining the nickname &quot;Magician&quot;. When Reyes first arrived in the United States, he took the name Cesar Morales as he knew that players had heard his name but not seen what he looked like and he wished to continue hustling.

In 2003, Reyes was featured in the Filipino movie &quot;Pakners&quot; with actor Fernando Poe Jr., which was Poe&#x27;s last film before his run for presidency and then death later in 2004. Reyes also appeared in the 2007 short film &quot;Nineball&quot;. In one episode of the TV series &quot;Magpakailanman&quot;, the story follows a young Efren &quot;Bata&quot; Reyes (portrayed by Anjo Yllana) in his early pool-playing days as he progresses from a money player to a tournament contender.

Reyes lives in Angeles City, with his wife Susan and their three children. He considers balkline to be his favorite cue sport, and plays chess as a hobby. Despite suggesting that his skill had declined by 2019, his games still attracted large crowds in the 2019 and 2021 Southeast Asian Games.

==Accolades==

Numerous fellow professional players have credited Reyes with being the greatest living player in the world. During ESPN television commentary on a semi-final match between Reyes and Mika Immonen at the 2000 BCA Open Nine-ball Championship, veteran professional Billy Incardona stated that Reyes was &quot;indisputably the best player in the world—especially when you consider all games—he can play any game as well as anyone, maybe better than anyone ... In my opinion we&#x27;re watching probably the greatest player in my lifetime and I&#x27;ve been watching pool for the better part of forty years.&quot;

In 1995, &quot;Billiards Digest&quot; magazine named Reyes the Player of the Year. The following year, when Reyes was ranked number one on the United States&#x27; Pro Billiards Tour, the June 1996 issue of the magazine featured a poll of &quot;billiard cognoscenti&quot;—pro players, billiards writers, industry insiders and the like—to pick the best in billiards in various categories. &quot;Billiards&quot;″ own elite named Reyes the best one-pocket player of all time. The magazine wrote, &quot;While a bevy of one-pocket geniuses abound, Efren Reyes, whose prowess in one-pocket is sometimes obscured by his 9-ball stardom, was the popular pick. Is there anything Bata can&#x27;t do?&quot;

Reyes became the first Asian to be inducted into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame in 2003. He was also inducted into the One Pocket Hall of Fame in 2004. Reyes was appointed Philippine Sports Ambassador for the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.

Reyes has been awarded the Philippine Sportswriters Association Sportsman of the Year on three occasions: in 1999, 2001, and 2006. He was given the Philippine Legion of Honor, and included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 60 Asian heroes in 2006. He was also awarded the Philippine Order of Lakandula &quot;Champion for Life Award&quot; in 2006. Reyes was named &quot;Player of the Decade&quot; for the 2000s by the U.S. Billiard Media Association.

Reyes has topped the AZ Billiards Money list five times: 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006. He also holds the record for highest recorded earnings of any pool player, being the most amount of money won in tournament play in a season, winning $645,000 in 2006.

In 2024, Reyes was inducted into the inaugural World Billiards Hall of Fame held at the newly opened World Billiards Museum in Yushan, China.

<doc id="435889" wikidata="Q145952" url="?curid=435889" title="Otilio Ulate Blanco">
<text>Luis Rafael de la Trinidad Otilio Ulate Blanco (August 25, 1891 – October 10, 1973) served as President of Costa Rica from 1949 to 1953. His French heritage comes from his mother, Ermida Blanco. He never married but had two daughters, Olga Marta Ulate Rojas (1937–2007) and Maria Ermida Ulate Rojas (1938) with Haydee Rojas Smith (British origins) 

His disputed election in 1948, whereby he was denied victory by the legislature in favor of Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, was the direct cause of José Figueres Ferrer&#x27;s armed uprising of that year and the ensuing 44-day Costa Rican Civil War.

Blanco started his career in politics as a journalist, director of local newspaper La Tribuna and owner of Diario de Costa Rica, principal newspaper at the time, where he directed his major political campaigns.

Ulate led the opposition party during the February 8th 1948 elections, where he defeated ex President Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia.

His government proved a good handling of economical development, Ulate raised the Consejo Nacional de Produccion (CNP)-National Production Committee-, the Central Bank of de Costa Rica (main financial institution in Costa Rica), the Contraloria General de la Republica (regulates government and public institutions&#x27; budgets and expenses), the &quot;Ley del Aguinaldo&quot; (law that enforces a 13th month paid salary for all Costa Rican workers during Christmas time), the right for women to vote in National Elections and the foundations for the actual International Juan Santamaria Airport (called &quot;El Coco&quot;), despite the fact that many of his achievements were self-recognized by following presidents. During a visit to the penitentiary in San Lucas Island he also ordered the release of Beltrán Cortés from the unusually public and confined cell President León Cortés Castro had ordered for him and placed him with the other prisoners.

He ran again as a presidential candidate in 1962. He was the ambassador of Costa Rica to Spain from 1970 to 1971.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

<doc id="435894" wikidata="Q887597" url="?curid=435894" title="Teodoro Picado Michalski">
<text>Teodoro Picado Michalski (10 January 1900 – 1 June 1960) was a Costa Rican politician who served as the president of Costa Rica from 1944 to 1948.

==Overview==

Picado governed Costa Rica immediately after the presidency of Rafael Angel Calderón Guardia and preceded the de facto junta of José Figueres. One of the most erudite presidents to govern Costa Rica, Picado was more moderate and not nearly as inflammatory as either his predecessor or successor.

==Election as president==

Before reaching the presidency, don Teodoro, in his capacity as President of the Constitutional Congress, had a very important and active role in approving the social reforms of the government of Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia (1940–1944).

Calderón heavily supported Picado during the 1944 election, through means legal and illegal. The campaign season was particularly ugly by Costa Rican standards, at times turning violent. According to recent, documented studies, by historians Fabrice Lehoucq and Ivan Molina, though there was some minor electoral fraud in a few voting tables far removed from the capital, it was not enough to have changed the outcome of the landslide election. Picado won by a 2:1 margin.

==Presidency==

In spite of the questioned election, Picado was a far less inflammatory figure than Calderón, who had angered the country&#x27;s coffee and mercantile elite.

Picado&#x27;s administration enacted many laws to modernize the state. The most prominent was the electoral reform of 1945, which created a modern Electoral Code of Laws and a Supreme Tribunal of Elections. The reform was partly a reaction to the outcry over the 1944 campaign season. The Electoral Code remains in full force today, and has been a guarantee to the Nation&#x27;s continued democratic elections. This electoral reform was saved by an executive order known in Costa Rican history as the &quot;Blank Check&quot;, decreed by President Picado on November the 21st, 1945 and published in the Official Gazette the day after. This decree permitted the inclusion of all the major innovations contemplated in the Electoral Code of Laws into the legislation in force by Congress on December 11, 1945.

==1948 revolution and exile==

In the 1948 election for Picado&#x27;s successor as Costa Rica&#x27;s President, Picado supported his predecessor, Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, who hoped to win a second term.

Former President Calderón lost the popular vote in a tight election to Otilio Ulate Blanco. This was the first time that elections were being held under the new Electoral Code of Laws and governed by the Tribunal of Elections, and certain anomalies were committed with regard to the vote counting deadlines and the loss of ballots. As a result, Calderón supporters in the legislature invalidated the election results in accordance with the Constitution. In March–April 1948, the protests over the election results grew into a revolution. José Figueres Ferrer, with the help of &quot;La Legion del Caribe&quot; of which Fidel Castro was a prominent member (See Dr. Rosendo Argüello &quot;Quienes y Como Nos Traicionaron&quot;), led the revolution, defeating the Costa Rican Army, loyal to Calderón and President Picado. With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day civil war resulting from this uprising was the bloodiest event in 20th-century Costa Rican history.

Although not deposed by force, don Teodoro relinquished the presidency to his vice-president, Santos León Herrera, who was left in charge of the country as Interim President as part of to end the armed uprising led by Figueres over the disputed elections for his successor.

Due to the difficult and persecutory political climate prevalent in the country during the de facto Provisional Government of José Figueres, in the aftermath of the revolution, he remained in Nicaragua, where he lived in exile until his death. His body was brought back to Costa Rica and is buried in the town of his ancestors, Paraíso, Cartago.

==Other biographical information==

During his life, Teodoro Picado was an eminent historian, who wrote many varied books and essays on the subject matter, and was a respected member of the Academy of Geography and History of Costa Rica and the Academy of the Spanish Language of Nicaragua. He also served as Secretary of Education in the third administration of Ricardo Jiménez (1932–1936) and was Director of the Institute of Alajuela (1930), where he left a lasting impression upon his disciples. In addition, he taught master classes on civil law in the Old Law School, starting in 1937.

He not only spoke several languages (English, Polish, French, and could converse in Russian, Italian, and German) but was learned in jurisprudence and classical studies. He became a lawyer in 1922. He was the disciple of three-time President Ricardo Jiménez and was an educator of the stature of Omar Dengo.

He was the son of two physicians, Teodoro Picado Marín and Polish native Jadwiga Warnia Michalska Wodziwodzka (born in Kraków or Radomsko, first female physician in Costa Rica) who met and married in Switzerland while they both were studying medicine. His great-grandparents were Teodoro Picado Solano married to Rita Morales García; Manuel Antonio Marín married to María Ambrosia Irola Alvarado; Josafat Warnia-Michalski married to &quot;(?)&quot;; Konstanty Wodziwodzki married to Concordia Spreglewska Clabon de la Tour. His grandparents were José Francisco Picado Morales married to Eulogía Marín Irola and Józef Warnia-Michalski married to Kamila Wodziwodzka Spreglewska.

In his first marriage Teodoro Picado Michalski married Mercedes Lara Fernández and had two children, Teodoro Picado Lara and Clemencia Picado Lara. In his second marriage with Etelvina Ramírez, they had one daughter, María Cecilia Picado Ramírez, who lives in Venice, Italy, and has two daughters. He also has relatives in Poland and elsewhere. Clemencia Picado Lara(†) has one son, named &quot;Fernán Soto Picado&quot;. Teodoro Picado Lara has 5 children: &quot;Susan, Janet, Teodoro, María and Nancy(†)&quot;.

<text>The Real Book is a musicians&#x27; fake book – a compilation of lead sheets for jazz standards. Fake books had been around at least since the late 1920s, but their organization was haphazard, and their content did not always keep pace with contemporary musical styles. The Real Book was initially produced by two students at the Berklee College of Music in the 1970s, as an updated fake book. It became so popular that the book was eventually &quot;legitimized&quot; by publisher Hal Leonard, and re-released in a series of editions and transpositions for various instruments.

== Background ==
For years, musicians had been producing &quot;lead sheets&quot;, so called because they contained only rough outlines of music pieces rather than fully notated scores. These lead sheets were collected together in volumes and sold to other musicians. These books gave the musician enough basic information – melody, chord symbols, structure, sometimes also lyrics – to &quot;fake&quot; their way through the tune, that is, to perform a credible version of a tune that they might not be familiar with, and for which they lacked a full score. Hence these collections became known as &quot;fake books&quot;.

Early fake books were mainly used by professional bands who performed mostly standards, often more geared to society and dance bands rather than jazz ensembles, and devoted much space to show tunes, novelty tunes, traditional jazz, etc. The first three &quot;Real Book&quot; volumes, in contrast, contained many bebop and other jazz standards that were likely to be encountered on jazz gigs at the time. For this reason, the books were quickly adopted among jazz players in the 1970s, particularly on the East Coast of the United States.

The original &quot;Real Book&quot; volumes, like earlier fake books, were printed without securing copyright releases or paying royalties, and they were thus illegal. These unlicensed books were all sold through informal connections, such as for cash in the backs of music stores, and between musicians. In 2004, the &quot;Real Book&quot; material was acquired by the publisher Hal Leonard and licensed for legal sale. Many new volumes were eventually added to the series, and some of the errors in the original volumes were corrected. These books also inspired a similar series, offered by the Sher Music Co., called &quot;The New Real Book&quot;.

&quot;The Real Book&quot; is published in editions to suit both transposing (B, E, F) and non-transposing (C) instruments, as well as bass clef and voice editions (&quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; voice, with lyrics). Each edition is identically paginated.

==History==
Compositions by Steve Swallow, Paul Bley, and Chick Corea are heavily represented in &quot;The Real Book&quot; with jazz standards and classic jazz compositions. Those were the songs that were played most in Boston in the early 1970s when the book was written. When Swallow was asked about the origin in February 2018, he said the book was written by students at Berklee who wanted to make money. They asked permission to use some of his songs, and he agreed. Swallow asked Bley and Steve Kuhn if they wanted some of their songs included, and they did; so they all contributed lead sheets. Swallow helped briefly with editing.

Then I watched these guys finally get the book together. One of them had a beautiful manuscript that subsequently became classic—it&#x27;s called the Real Book font, and it imitates with uncanny accuracy his hand. He went on to be a big-time music copyist in Hollywood... The irony is that shortly after the book was put out, some other people realized they could photocopy it and sell it themselves, and the two guys who did all the work and put the book together made a lot less money than they had hoped to because there were imitation &quot;Real Books&quot; out there almost immediately... &quot;The Real Book&quot; was imperfect; there were wrong changes throughout it, but it was tremendously more accurate than what existed previously. And also, it was a lot more legible; it was easy to read.&quot;

Only the first volume is the original. The two following volumes of &quot;The Real Book&quot; were produced. Volume 2 is printed in characteristically &quot;rough&quot; handwriting and transcription, while the third volume is typeset on a computer. The transcriptions in &quot;The Real Book&quot; are unlicensed; no royalties are paid to the musicians whose songs appear in the book. Consequently, the book violates copyright and is therefore illegal. In the past, it was usually sold surreptitiously in local music stores, often hidden behind the counter for customers who asked. PDF editions of the book are often available illegally on P2P networks.

The name is a play on words from the common name for these types of song folios: &quot;fake book&quot;, though it might have been influenced by the Boston alternative weekly newspaper, &quot;The Real Paper&quot;, started by writers of &quot;The Phoenix&quot; newspaper in Boston after a labor dispute.

A variety of dates have been attributed to the book. The April 1990 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; featured &quot;The Real Book&quot; in the &quot;Man at His Best&quot; column by Mark Roman in an article called &quot;Clef Notes&quot;. He stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know a jazzman who hasn&#x27;t owned, borrowed, or Xeroxed pages from a &quot;Real Book&quot; at least once in his career,&quot; and he quoted John F. Voigt, music librarian at Berklee. &quot;&quot;The Real Book&quot; came out around 1971. The only material available in print then was crap.&quot;

Another feature surfaced on April 10, 1994, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; article &quot;Flying Below the Radar of Copyrights&quot;. Guitarist Bill Wurtzel was quoted as saying, &quot;Everyone has one, but no one knows where they come from.&quot; The writer of the article, Michael Lydon, said, &quot;I got mine in 1987 from a bassist who lives in Queens and who attended the Berklee School of Music in Boston; many in jazz circles suspect that students there reproduced the first copies of it in the mid-70s.&quot;

Pat Metheny claims that while teaching at Berklee College of Music from 1973 to 1974, one of his guitar students and one of Gary Burton&#x27;s vibraphone students (both of whom wish to remain anonymous) invented the idea of assembling the anthology that would form &quot;The Real Book&quot;. Early editions included several compositions by Metheny as &quot;Untitled Tune&quot; as they had not yet been recorded and released.

=== Hal Leonard ===
In 2004, the music publisher Hal Leonard obtained the rights to most of the tunes contained in the original &quot;Real Book&quot; and published the first legal edition, calling it the &quot;Real Book Sixth Edition&quot; in tacit acknowledgment of the five previous illegal versions. The cover and binding are identical to the &quot;old&quot; &quot;Real Book,&quot; and the books employ a font similar to the handwritten style of the originals. One hundred and thirty-seven tunes were omitted from the 6th edition that were in the 5th, and 90 new tunes were added.

Hal Leonard released &quot;The Real Book, Volume II, Second Edition&quot; in answer to the &quot;Real Book, Volume II&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Real Book, Volume III, Second Edition&quot; (July 2006), &quot;The Real Book, Volume IV&quot; (December 2010), &quot;The Real Book, Volume V&quot; (June 2013), and &quot;The Real Book, Volume VI&quot; (June 2016). These books contain much of the same material as their counterparts, and in most cases charts from Hal Leonard books are compatible with the &quot;Real Book&quot; charts. In some cases, compatibility issues occur where corrections have been made to some of the mistakes in the 5th edition charts; in other cases, 6th edition charts reference changes on different recordings from those cited in the previous edition.

<text>The Elim Pentecostal Church is a UK-based Pentecostal Christian denomination. It was founded in Ireland in 1915 by George Jeffreys and is the second-largest Pentecostal denomination in the UK.

==History==

George Jeffreys (1889–1962), a Welshman, with a Welsh Congregational church background. He was converted at the age of 15 in the Welsh Revival of 1904, after which he and his brother, Stephen, became involved in preaching and evangelism, and were considered revivalists. Alexander A. Boddy, Vicar of All Saints, Monkwearmouth, Sunderland invited him to preach at his annual Whitsuntide International Pentecostal Convention in Sunderland in May 1913. His preaching came to the notice of William Gillespie who had been involved in the formative work of pentecostalism in Ireland. He invited Jeffreys to join him in Ireland just after Christmas that year and they made the decision that Jeffreys should hold an evangelistic campaign in Monaghan. However the Monaghan mission was not to open until the summer of 1915, as permission to use the Methodist hall for a Pentecostal assembly was denied. Jeffreys returned to Wales, and also campaigned in England, before returning to Ireland, where he ran a successful campaign for a Pentecostal congregation at Dover Street in Belfast at Christmas in 1914. It was thus in January 1915, when Jeffreys met with seven others, that they came to a resolution that Jeffreys should begin a permanent evangelistic work in Ireland, preaching the full gospel on Pentecostal lines. This work began from a marquee in Monaghan that summer. Jeffreys continued to campaign in England and across Ireland, but the first premises were leased for a church congregation in an old laundry in Hunter Street, Belfast, and this was opened in August 1915. Jeffreys became pastor Jeffreys, and the principal of the movement. The new church was called Elim Christ Church, the first Elim church.

The church was brought together, first as the Elim Evangelistic Band, but this was changed to Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance when the Deed Poll was registered in April 1934. The name &#x27;Elim&#x27; was taken from the account in the Book of Exodus, chapter 15, verse 27, where the Israelites, leaving the bondage of Egypt under the leadership of Moses, found an oasis called Elim: &quot;Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters.&quot; This represented a place of refreshing, and it was thought appropriate for a revival movement at that time.

In 1934, Jeffreys attempted to introduce the teaching of British Israelism into the Elim churches. The matter was debated at the annual ministerial conference between John Leech for the identity and E.J. Phillips against it. This was then followed by a ministerial questions, and a vote, and the resolution was decisively defeated. Following this Jeffreys made attempts to reform church governance. There was suspicion that he wanted congregations to be able to individually decide matters of doctrine as a means of introducing the British Israelism identity, and progress was slow. He resigned from his position as principal of the church in 1939, but was persuaded to return. In May 1940 the conference agreed many changes in governance at his request. After the agreement was reached, in August 1940, Jeffreys made some additional demands, raising concerns over the size of the conference, which he believed could be manipulated. He resigned again in 1940 and formed the Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship, starting in Nottingham, and taking some other Elim congregations with him. Jeffreys and others who left with him held the trusteeship of some of these churches, and refused to sign them over to Elim, as he was legally obliged to do. He then founded other churches throughout England until the 1960s, but in 1986, 24 years after Jeffreys&#x27; death, the Nottingham church inducted an Elim pastor and reaffiliated with Elim, and other Bible-pattern churches were reconciled with Elim, although some chose to join the Assemblies of God, and one remained independent. After Jeffreys left, the presidency of Elim initially passed to George Kingston, a wealthy businessman who had founded many of the Elim affiliated congregations in Essex. Kingston held the position from 1940-45, after which the presidency became an annual appointment.

On the night of 23 June 1978, eight British missionaries and four young children (including a three-week-old baby) connected with the Elim mission in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) were bayoneted to death by guerrilla fighters in the Vumba massacre. Most of the women were raped. This brutal massacre in the Vumba and the ministry of Elim in Zimbabwe was commemorated in the 2017 book &quot;The Axe and the Tree&quot; by Stephen Griffiths.

==Doctrine==
Elim Pentecostal beliefs include: the Bible as divinely inspired; the three in one as the Godhead; the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and his complete humanity and sinless life, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, heavenly intercession, the second coming of Jesus; the universal sinfulness of mankind; the work of the Holy Spirit in conviction, repentance, regeneration and sanctification according to Acts 2:38; the baptism of the Holy Spirit &quot;with signs following&quot;; that salvation is received by faith alone and evidenced by the fruit of the Spirit. The baptism of believers by immersion and Communion are held to be ordinances. A distinctive feature of Elim&#x27;s Pentecostal theology has been the belief that Baptism with the Spirit is followed by signs, but not necessarily the sign of speaking in tongues. 

==Organization==
Elim represents a global network of about 650 churches in the UK and Ireland, and over 4000 Elim or Elim affiliated churches overseas, with a weekly attendance of about 50,000 in the UK and more than 300,000 overseas, operating in some 50 countries worldwide. Kensington Temple in London is the largest church in the denomination. Elim missions exist in 35 countries with hospitals, orphanages, and schools. The church operates Regents Theological College in Malvern, Worcestershire, where the movement&#x27;s headquarters are also based. The authority of governance of the church is rested in the annual conference. Guidance of the denomination is placed in the National Leadership Team and the General Superintendent between sessions. Mark Pugh, Pastor of Rediscover Church in Exeter, is the current General Superintendent of the movement. He took up the role at the 2024 conference from Chris Cartwright his predecessor, who had been in the role since 2016, superseding John Glass. Elim headquarters is in Malvern, alongside its Bible College. Elim became a founding member of the Pentecostal Churches of the United Kingdom in 1998. It has been a member of the Evangelical Alliance for many years. Though the local congregations are commonly and popularly known as &quot;Elim Pentecostal Churches&quot;, the legal name of the denomination is still &quot;Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance&quot;, which is based on the church&#x27;s stand for four fundamental claims – &quot;Jesus Christ as the Saviour, Healer, Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, and Coming King.&quot;

==Hymnal==
The standard hymnal of the Elim Church was the &quot;Redemption Hymnal&quot;. Today however, the music and worship is mainly modern and contemporary worship songs with some traditional hymns alongside. Now Elim has its own Worship Department writing songs and training worship teams called &quot;Elim Sound&quot;.

==Churches==
Many Elim Pentecostal Churches carry the Elim name alongside their location, however a number of Churches are exceptions to this rule. Notable Elim churches include:
*Kensington Temple in London
*Myrtle House, in Wales

<text>The United States Coast Guard Academy (USCGA), located in New London, Connecticut, is the U.S. service academy specifically for the United States Coast Guard. Founded in 1876, the academy provides education to future Coast Guard officers in one of nine major fields of study.

Students are officers-in-training, and are referred to as cadets. Upon graduation, cadets receive a Bachelor of Science degree and commission in the U.S. Coast Guard as an ensign. In exchange for their debt-free education valued at over $250,000, graduates incur a five-year active-duty service obligation, with additional years if the graduate attends flight school or subsequent government-funded graduate school. Out of approximately 300 cadets entering the academy each summer, around 250 graduate. Cadets choose from nine majors, with a curriculum that is graded according to their performance in a holistic program of academics, military bearing, physical fitness, character, and leadership.

Cadets are required to adhere to the academy&#x27;s &quot;Honor Concept,&quot; &quot;&quot;Who lives here reveres honor, honors duty&quot;,&quot; which is emblazoned in the walls of the academy&#x27;s entrance. The academy&#x27;s motto is &quot;Scientiæ Cedit Mare&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;the sea yields to knowledge&quot;. Its academic programs are accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==History==
The roots of the academy lie in the School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service, the school of the Revenue Cutter Service. The School of Instruction was established near New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1876 and used USRC &quot; James C. Dobbin&quot; for its exercises. Captain John Henriques served as superintendent from founding until 1883. The one civilian instructor was Professor Edwin Emery, who taught mathematics, astronomy, English composition, French, physics, theoretical steam engineering, history, international law, and revenue law, among other subjects. The school was a two-year apprenticeship, in essence, supplemented by minimal classroom work. The student body averaged five to ten cadets per class. With changes to new training vessels, the school moved to Curtis Bay, Baltimore in 1900 and to Fort Trumbull in 1910, a Revolutionary War–era Army installation in New London, Connecticut. In 1914, the school became the Revenue Cutter Academy, and then the Coast Guard Academy in 1915 with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service to form the U.S. Coast Guard.

Land was purchased in New London on 31 July 1930 for the construction of the Coast Guard Academy. The 40-acre site was made up of two parcels from the Allyn and Payne estates and was purchased for $100,000. The $100,000 was not raised through a bond issue, as originally planned, but with a bank loan based on uncollected back taxes. The contract was awarded to Murch Brothers Construction Company of St. Louis and ground was broken in January 1931 by Jean Hamlet, daughter of Rear Admiral Harry G. Hamlet, Academy Superintendent from 1928 to 1932. On 15 May 1931, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon visited New London to lay the cornerstone of Hamilton Hall. Construction proceeded relatively on schedule and cadets moved in to the new buildings on 20 September 1932.

In 1946, the academy received the barque &quot;Horst Wessel&quot; as a war reparation from Germany, a 295-foot tall ship which was renamed . It remains the main training vessel for cadets at the academy as well as for officer candidates at the Coast Guard&#x27;s Officer Candidate School, which is located on the grounds of the academy.

The academy was racially integrated in 1962 at the request of President Kennedy. The academy began admitting women in 1976 at the request of Congress.

In 2018, the academy emblem was redesigned by Nick Desjardins of the Biddeford Regional Center of Technology.

==Admission==

Unlike the other service academies, admission to the USCGA does not require a congressional nomination. This is due to the fervent objections of Captain John A. Henriques, the first Superintendent of the Revenue Cutter School of Instruction (later the Revenue Cutter Academy). His objection stemmed from years of poor political appointments in the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service&#x27;s bureaucracy.

Each year more than 2,000 students apply and appointments are offered until the number accepting appointments to the incoming class numbers reaches approximately 400; the average entering class size is 300 cadets. Those who have received appointments as cadets report to the USCGA in late June or early July for &quot;Swab Summer&quot;, a basic military training program designed to prepare them for the rigors of their Fourth Class year. After four years of study and training, approximately 250 of those cadets will graduate. About 40 percent of cadets are women.

==Academics==

All graduating cadets earn commissions as ensigns in the United States Coast Guard, as well as Bachelor of Science degrees. For that reason the academy maintains a core curriculum of science and professional development courses in addition to major-specific courses. Each cadet takes two semesters of classes during the school year and then spends the majority of the summer in military training to produce officers of character with the requisite professional skills. Among these are courses in leadership, ethics, organizational behavior, and nautical science. The majority of cadets report to their first units after graduating, which are either afloat units, shore units, or basic flight training as student naval aviators, with the training conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Navy. Those that are assigned afloat serve as either deck watch officers or student engineers. Professional maritime studies courses help prepare cadets in piloting, voyage planning, deck seamanship, and all aspects of ship-handling, as well as Coast Guard leadership and administrative duties.

===Majors===
Academics at the USCGA stress the sciences and engineering, but different courses of study are available. In addition, several of the majors offer tracks of specialization (for example, marine and environmental science majors can choose to focus on biology, chemistry, or geophysics). Cadets sometimes opt to take elective courses with Connecticut College (adjacent the academy&#x27;s campus) as part of an open exchange agreement.

===Military training===

Each summer, cadets participate in training programs according to their class. The summers are organized as follows:
* Swab Summer: The new class of freshmen report in to the academy, and are sworn into the military. They undergo a seven-week basic training program that culminates on a week-long voyage underway on the barque USCGC &quot;Eagle&quot;.
* Third-class (3/c) Summer: Five weeks aboard the USCGC &quot;Eagle&quot; training under sail, five weeks aboard an operational Coast Guard cutter or small boat station in the role of junior enlisted (i.e., standing watches as helmsman, lookout, quartermaster of the watch, or engineering watch).
* Second-class (2/c) Summer: damage control training, weapon qualifications, navigation rules certification, aviation internship, sail training program, and three weeks as members of the cadre, who train the incoming swabs.
* First-class (1/c) Summer: Ten weeks aboard an operational cutter in the role of a junior officer (i.e., standing bridge watches conning the ship as Officer of the Deck), or an optional internship for exceptional cadets who split their summer with five weeks at an internship and five weeks aboard a cutter.

Each week during the school year cadets participate in regimental review, a formal military drill. In addition, cadets perform a variety of military duties at the academy. Like all cadets and midshipmen at the United States service academies, Coast Guard cadets are on active duty in the military and wear uniforms at all times. Cadets receive a monthly stipend to pay for books, uniforms, and other necessities. Cadets receive monthly pay of $1,017.00, as of 2015. From this amount, pay is automatically deducted for the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, services, and other miscellaneous expenses.

==Organization of the Corps of Cadets==
The Corps is organized as one regiment divided into eight companies, each of which is composed of about 120 cadets of all classes. Although the Corps of Cadets is supervised directly by the Commandant of Cadets (a Coast Guard officer with the rank of captain), the academy operates on the concept of &quot;the Corps leading the Corps.&quot;

The Corps of Cadets is largely a self-directed organization that follows a standard military chain of command:
* 1st class cadets lead the corps
* 2nd class cadets are cadre in swab summer training and are primarily responsible for leading and developing 4th class cadets. They serve as mentors
* 3rd class cadets are role models to 4th class cadets
* 4th class cadets are responsible for learning and applying Coast Guard core values such as leadership, teamwork, attention to detail, accountability, etc.

The highest-ranking cadet in each company is the company commander, a first-class cadet (&quot;firstie&quot;), equivalent to a . Although each company has some leeway in their standards and practices, every company commander reports to the regimental staff which plans and oversees all aspects of cadet life. At the top of the cadet chain of command is the regimental commander, the highest ranking cadet. Command positions, both in companies and on regimental staff, are highly competitive, and a cadet&#x27;s overall class rank is often a deciding factor in who is awarded the position.

The eight companies are named for the first eight letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet. Each has a special focus in administering day-to-day affairs: Alfa Company manages health and wellness. Bravo Company runs training. Charlie Company administers the honor system, Delta Company coordinates drill and ceremonies. Echo Company manages transportation and logistics. Foxtrot Company operates the cadet conduct system, organizes the watch rotations, and updates the cadet regulations. Golf Company is in charge of supplies for cleaning and repairing damaged rooms within Chase Hall. Hotel Company is in charge of morale events.

To accomplish their missions, each company is divided, along shipboard lines, into three departments, each of which is divided into divisions with specific responsibilities. Divisions are the most basic unit at the Coast Guard Academy, and each has a very specific purpose. Each division is led by a firstie and contains several members of each other class.

This organizational structure is designed to give every cadet a position of leadership and to emulate the structure of a Coast Guard cutter, in which the division officer and department head positions are filled by junior officers. Third-class cadets directly mentor the fourth-class in their division, just as junior petty officers would be responsible for the most junior enlisted personnel (non-rates). Second-class cadets act as non-commissioned officers, and ensure that the regulations and accountability are upheld. Firsties (like junior officers) are in supervisory roles, and are responsible for carrying out the mission of their divisions and ensuring the well-being of those under their command. Exchange cadets from the other federal service academies are also a part of the corps, and take part in many activities alongside their USCGA counterparts.

==Extracurricular activities==
===Athletics===

The USCGA Athletic Department offers 24 intercollegiate sports for cadets. The academy&#x27;s athletics teams generally compete in Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Cadets devote two hours per academic day to athletic activities, either on varsity teams, club teams, or other sports pursuits. The academy nickname is the Bears, after the USRC &quot;Bear&quot;, which made a dramatic rescue in Alaska in 1897, shortly after the opening of the academy.

===Music===
Principal non-athletic activities are musical centered on Leamy Hall. Regimental Band, Windjammers Drum &amp; Bugle Corps, various pep bands, and the NiteCaps Jazz Band are instrumental programs. Chapel Choirs, Glee Club, the Fairwinds all-female a cappella group, and The Idlers all-male sea shanty group are vocal programs.

===Model UN===
The academy&#x27;s Model UN team was started in 2004, and has since been successfully competing around North America, and at the World Model UN Conference.

=== Pride ===
The academy has clubs and teams dedicated to increasing campus morale. These include the cheer squad, dance team and Social Committee.

==Notable alumni==
Alumni of the Coast Guard Academy are known collectively as the &quot;Long Blue Line&quot;.

==Superintendents==


==U.S. Coast Guard Museum==

The U.S. Coast Guard Museum is located in Waesche Hall on the grounds of the United States Coast Guard Academy. The museum&#x27;s artifacts reflect the history of the U.S. Coast Guard and include ship models, carved figureheads, cannons, uniforms, medals, weapons, memorabilia and paintings. Visitors must bring a government-issued photo identification to enter the campus, and foreign visitors must make an appointment with the Curator before visiting the museum.

<text>Thomas Joseph Rowe (November 4, 1950, Lewiston, Maine – January 17, 2004, Portland, Maine) was the bass player and a singer in the folk trios Schooner Fare and Turkey Hollow. He was noted for playing a model XL2 Steinberger bass guitar. Born to Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Rowe, and his wife, Thoma, he had two brothers named Russ and Chuck, and a sister named Shirley. He went to school in Auburn, Maine and graduated from Edward Little High School as part of the class of 1969. He majored in Music Education at Gorham State College, now the University of Southern Maine, though never graduated. In 1975, Rowe joined the Maine folk/rock group Devonsquare. Three months after joining, the band split into two separate groups, and he went along with Steve and Chuck Romanoff, to form Schooner Fare. As part of the band, Tom sang and played electric bass, pennywhistle, and sometimes guitar. He also wrote a number of songs for the band, which included &quot;Salt Water Farm,&quot; &quot;Big House, Middle House, Back House, Barn,&quot; &quot;John Cook,&quot; &quot;The Royal Tar,&quot; and &quot;Way Down Below.&quot;

In 1991 Rowe released a solo album titled &quot;Whistle Up a Storm,&quot; much of which he recorded with his son, Dave Rowe, at the controls. (Note: In addition to Dave, Tom has four daughters: Erikka, Marin, Summer, and Toni Lyn.) In 1992 Tom and son formed Rowe by Rowe. After six years as a duo, Rowe by Rowe added Rowe&#x27;s longtime friend Denny Breau, to form Turkey Hollow Consort; later called simply Turkey Hollow. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in November 2003, and died on January 17, 2004, due to complications from the cancer treatment. Rowe was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award posthumously by the World Folk Music Association in 2004.

Schooner Fare continues to perform: the Romanoff brothers decided against replacing him, and perform now as a duo. Turkey Hollow continued together for about two more years, but subsequently disbanded. Since then, Dave Rowe continues to perform as a soloist.

<doc id="435910" wikidata="Q672890" url="?curid=435910" title="Hatchet">
<text>A hatchet (from the Old French , a diminutive form of &quot;hache&quot;, &#x27;axe&#x27; of Germanic origin) is a single-handed striking tool with a sharp blade on one side used to cut and split wood, and a hammerhead on the other side. Hatchets may also be used for hewing when making flattened surfaces on logs; when the hatchet head is optimized for this purpose it is called a hewing hatchet.

Although hand axe and hatchet are often used interchangeably in contemporary usage, historically the nomenclature distinguishes two distinct classes of tools. All 19th and 20th century manufacturer and retailer literature unanimously separate hatches from hand axes, sometimes placing the former in a separate section of their product catalogs. Others might place the two categories separately but adjacent to each other.

A &quot;hand axe&quot; (also known by terms including &quot;camp axe,&quot; &quot;belt axe,&quot; &quot;hunters axe&quot; and others) is a short-handled woods tool. A &quot;hatchet&quot; is a short-handled construction trades tool with multipurpose head purposely designed for a given application. For this reason, hatchet handles are generally straight so that users can rotate them in their hand to switch from one head feature to the other.

The most common hatchet head patterns are the carpenter&#x27;s hatchet, roofing/shingling hatchet and lathing/drywall hatchet.

&quot;Hatchet&quot; was used to describe a small battle axe in Middle English.

&quot;Burying the hatchet&quot; is a phrase meaning &quot;making peace,&quot; attributed to an Iroquois tradition of hiding or putting away a tomahawk after a peace agreement.

<doc id="435915" wikidata="Q1531992" url="?curid=435915" title="Splitting maul">
<text>A splitting maul also known as a &quot;block buster&quot;, &quot;block splitter&quot;, &quot;chop and maul&quot;, &quot;sledge axe&quot;, &quot;go-devil&quot; or &quot;hamaxe&quot; is a heavy, long-handled axe used for splitting a piece of wood along its grain. One side of its head is like a sledgehammer, and the other side is like an axe.

== Tools ==

; Wedged mauls: A typical wood splitting maul has a head mass of 6 to 8 lb or approximately 2.7 to 3.6 kg, respectively. Traditionally, mauls have a wedge-shaped head, but some modern versions have conical heads or swiveling sub-wedges. The original maul resembles an axe but with a broader head. For splitting wood, this tool is much better than a typical axe. The weight of it is more advantageous, and it is less likely to become stuck in the wood thanks to its width. The wedge section of a maul head must be slightly convex to avoid jamming and it cannot have the elongated &quot;hollow ground&quot; concave-section that a cutting axe may use. Unlike an axe, maul handles are normally straight and have a more circular cross-section than the elongated oval axe handles tend to be. A maul&#x27;s handle, unlike an axe, is intentionally used for levering as well as swinging. The handles are typically made from hickory, though synthetic fibreglass handles have become common. Plastic handles are more difficult to break and their factory-attached heads are less likely to work free with the levering action of a maul. In the early 1970s a triangular head design with a reinforced metal handle was introduced called the &quot;Monster Maul.&quot;
; Separate wedges: Splitting may also be done with a separate wedge and a large hammer. As this allows several wedges to be used together, it permits larger logs to be split. To avoid mushrooming the head of the wedge, they are driven with a heavy wooden mallet rather than an iron hammer. In parts of England the word &quot;maul&quot; denotes this tool with a very heavy wooden head. It is also known as a beetle; there is a well known pub on the River Thames at Moulsford called the Beetle and Wedge.
; Powered log splitters: Hydraulic log splitters are commonly used today. They can be used either horizontally or vertically.

== Techniques ==
The maul is most commonly struck onto a flush-cut section of log, usually standing on end atop a splitting stump or other suitable base. Most cut sections can be split in a single downward chop of the maul, splitting the wood apart along its grain. Mauls regularly become stuck in the log for several reasons, such as the wood not being struck with adequate force, the wood containing hidden knots, or the length of wood being too long. Unlike an axe, mauls are effective longer after the edge dulls, as the primary mechanism is that of a wedge pushed through along the wood grain, and not a cross-grain chop of an axe. In some cases, longer logs may be split while they rest length-wise on the base or ground. Mauls often become stuck in logs mid-split requiring a &quot;full-lift&quot; chop to be used. This involves the chopper reswinging the maul, but this time lifting the half-split log while still attached to the embedded maul, often requiring one or two additional full-lift chops. Another technique for splitting upright logs of thicker diameter is to land the maul&#x27;s full force off-center of the log, usually removing of the mass of the log. When repeated, large logs that would ordinarily cause the maul to be embedded on a center-strike can be handled easily. Additionally, as the temperature gets colder, the fibers in the log become more brittle making the logs easier to split.

== Safety ==
The hammer side of the maul is often used in wood splitting when combined with a splitting wedge, driving the wedge into the wood in the same fashion as the maul itself. This is generally used when attempting to split logs with a large diameter. Modern mauls are made of a strong enough steel to withstand the metal-to-metal contact without chipping. However, it is still common for the wedge itself to chip off. This can be dangerous as flying chips of steel could damage the eye. This is also the easiest way to break a maul&#x27;s handle because the wedge is a very small target as opposed to the whole log, and can be overshot, resulting in the handle hitting full-force onto the wedge. This greatly weakens the handle, and can cause it to break after only a few over-shots.

Harder seasoned logs which have dried sufficiently often split apart with enough force that each half tumbles away at some speed, which is a hazard for people or objects nearby.

A common danger for inexperienced splitters is to miss the upright log entirely or give it only a glancing blow. If the maul lands beyond the log, the maul handle may either bounce or break. If the maul lands in front of the log, it may hit the feet of the splitter if they are in a closed stance. If the maul hits the side of the log without biting in, the maul commonly will bounce to one side and to the ground. In this situation, even a widened stance may still leave the splitter&#x27;s feet vulnerable.

When performing the &quot;full-lift&quot; chop described above, the splitter must never raise the maul and log above head height.

Generally speaking, a maul should never swing to the side. Rather it should be powered through the drop, using force to assist the natural weight of the maul. In addition a suitable splitting base is one of the most important components to splitting wood with a maul. Wood can be split directly on the ground, although this is a disadvantage for a few reasons. For one the ground, if not frozen, will give on each blow, thereby weakening the overall effect of the blow. The second disadvantage is that it can present the log to be split at a low level, forcing the person splitting the wood to bend over during the swing, which causes back fatigue. The best bases are flush-cut segments of hardwood logs, usually about one foot tall. For repeated seasonal use the top open grain may be treated slightly. The diameter of the base should be at least twice that of the wood placed atop it for splitting, and the base should be placed on firm ground.

Another technique to improve safety involves pinning the head of the maul to the handle. Repeated use can loosen the head, and if the wedge or expander fails, the head will fly from the handle. Placing a pin involves drilling a small diameter hole through the side of the maul, into and through the handle, and usually out the other side. A small, flush, or counter-sunk pin of aluminum or similar material should be placed through the head and secured. It is critical that the pin not protrude from the side of the maul head.

<doc id="435921" wikidata="Q139627" url="?curid=435921" title="Altar server">
<text>An altar server is a lay assistant to a member of the clergy during a Christian liturgy. An altar server attends to supporting tasks at the altar such as fetching and carrying, ringing the altar bell, helping bring up the gifts, and bringing up the liturgical books, among other things. If young, the server is commonly called an altar boy or altar girl. In some Christian denominations, altar servers are known as acolytes.

== Latin Church ==
While the function of altar server is commonly associated with children, it can be and is carried out by people of any age or dignity.

According to the &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot;, &quot;Mass should not be celebrated without a minister, or at least one of the faithful, except for a just and reasonable cause.&quot;

=== The term &quot;acolyte&quot; ===

As in other churches, altar servers are sometimes called acolytes in the Latin Church. Pope Benedict XVI spoke of Saint Tarcisius as &quot;presumably an acolyte, that is, an altar server&quot;. However, within the Latin Church, the term &quot;acolyte&quot; is also used in a more restricted sense, often specified as &quot;instituted acolyte&quot;, to mean an adult woman or man who has received the instituted ministry of that name. Acolytes in this narrower sense are not necessarily preparing for ordination as deacons and priests. They are authorized to carry out some functions, in particular that of cleansing the Eucharistic vessels, that are not entrusted to ordinary servers. Those who are to be ordained to the diaconate must be instituted as acolytes at least six months previously. This ministry was long classified in the Latin Church as a minor order, as by the Council of Trent. The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot;, which does not use the term &quot;server&quot; and instead speaks of altar servers generically among &quot;other ministers&quot;, treats in detail of the functions of the &quot;acolyte&quot;, often specifying &quot;instituted acolyte&quot;.

=== Female altar servers ===

The 1983 Code of Canon Law altered the juridical situation: without distinguishing between male and female, it declared: &quot;Lay persons can fulfill the function of lector in liturgical actions by temporary designation. All lay persons can also perform the functions of commentator or cantor, or other functions, according to the norm of law.&quot; On 30 June 1992, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts issued an authentic interpretation of that canon declaring that service of the altar is one of the &quot;other functions&quot; open to lay persons in general, without distinguishing between male and female.

In reference to this authentic interpretation, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments sent on 15 March 1994 a circular letter to presidents of episcopal conferences, clarifying that the canon in question is only of permissive character. It does not require the use of female altar servers. It is thus for each diocesan bishop to decide whether to allow them in his diocese. A later document from 2001 states that even if a bishop permits female altar servers, the priest in charge of a church in that diocese is not obliged to recruit them, since no one, male or female, has a &quot;right&quot; to become an altar server. The document also states that &quot;it will always be very appropriate to follow the noble tradition of having boys serve at the altar&quot;.

As priests in charge of churches are not obliged to avail of a diocesan bishop&#x27;s permission in this matter, those belonging to traditionalist Catholic groups such as the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, the Institute of The Good Shepherd, the Society of Saint Pius X and the self-professed Catholic CMRI and some other priests do not.

In the United States, after the Arlington Diocese&#x27;s decision to allow them, the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska in 2006 became the only diocese in the country that did not allow females to be altar servers. However, it was joined by a church in the Diocese of Phoenix in August 2011, when it was announced that girls would no longer be allowed to altar serve.

===Duties at Mass ===

In the absence of instituted acolytes, some of their functions at Mass may be carried out by altar servers.
*Servers hold liturgical books for the priest when he is not at the altar and is proclaiming the presidential prayers with outstretched hands. They bring and hold such things as books, thuribles, the lavabo water and towel, vessels to hold the consecrated bread, and microphones.
* Entrance: The entrance procession is led by a thurifer with burning incense (if incense is used at the Mass) and a cross-bearer carrying a processional cross, who is flanked on either side by another server bearing a lighted candle.
* Proclamation of the Gospel: If incense is used, a server presents to the priest at the Alleluia or other pre-Gospel chant the thurible and the incense that he puts in the thurible and blesses, and servers, who may carry the thurible and lighted candles, precede to the ambo the deacon or priest who proclaims the Gospel there.
* Preparation of the Gifts: One or more servers assist in arranging the corporal, the purificator(s), the chalice(s), the pall(s), and the Missal on the altar, leaving it to the deacon to take care of the sacred vessels. (At a concelebrated Mass without participation by a deacon, a concelebrating priest carries out the functions assigned to the deacon.) If, as is appropriate, the bread and wine for the Mass are presented by the faithful, servers assist the priest or deacon who receives these and perhaps other gifts and carry the bread and wine to the priest, placing other gifts in a place distinct from the altar. They present the cruets of wine and water for the priest or deacon to pour some into the chalice. If incense is used, a server presents the thurible and incense to the priest, who incenses the offerings, the cross and the altar, after which the deacon or a server incenses the priest and the people. When the priest then washes his hands standing at the side of the altar, a server pours the water over them.
* Consecration: An altar server rings a bell shortly before the consecration, generally at the epiclesis (when the priest extends his hands above the gifts). In accordance with local custom, a server also rings the bell when, after the consecrations of the bread and wine, the priest shows the Host and then the Chalice. If incense is used, a server incenses the consecrated host and the chalice while these are being shown to the people.
* Sign of Peace: The priest or deacon may give the sign of peace to servers, while remaining within the sanctuary.
* Distribution of Holy Communion: In some places it is customary for servers to assist at the distribution of Holy Communion by holding a communion-plate for communicants. Whether it is to be held by communicants or by a server, a communion-plate is placed on the credence table before Mass. Its use (held by the communicants) is prescribed when Holy Communion is given by intinction.
* Recessional: The servers lead the priest and any other clergy as at the entrance procession, except that a server who acted as thurifer at the entrance now follows the cross-bearer.
* If a bishop celebrates Mass solemnly, two servers, wearing vimpae, hold the mitre and the crosier, and present them at the appropriate times.

===Vestments===
The vestment common to all ordained and instituted ministers of whatever rank is an alb, which is to be tied at the waist with a cincture unless the alb is made to fit without cincture. Acolytes, readers and other lay ministers (such as altar servers) may wear either an alb or other appropriate attire as determined by the local episcopal conference.

Servers often wear cassock and surplice, with black and red being the most common colors for a server&#x27;s cassock.

==Byzantine Rite==
In the Byzantine Rite, altar servers assist the higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or liturgical fans in processions and entrances; maintain the censer, ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with incense and handing it to the priest or deacon when required; preparing the hot water (&quot;zeon&quot;) in time for it to be added to the chalice at the Divine Liturgy; prepare the antidoron for the people to receive after Holy Communion; and any other necessary tasks so that the priest need not be distracted during the service. An altar server is vested in the sticharion only.

In the early Church, before someone could be a server he had to be tonsured. Nowadays, in many places it is not necessary to be tonsured before one is allowed to serve (since the tonsure must be done by a bishop or higher-ranking priest). The rites of &quot;Setting Aside a Taper-bearer&quot; and &quot;Tonsuring a Reader&quot; have now been combined into one service. It is the custom in some traditions, such as the Greek Orthodox or Melkite Catholic, to allow tonsured altar servers to also vest in the orarion, worn crossed over the back like that of a subdeacon but with the ends hanging parallel in front. Among the Russians, however, the orarion is not usually worn by servers, but only by duly ordained subdeacons and deacons, with the exception that laymen who are blessed to perform some of the functions of subdeacons may sometimes be blessed to wear the orar.

Before vesting, the server must fold his sticharion and bring it to the priest for him to bless. The priest blesses and lays his hand on the folded sticharion. The server kisses the priest&#x27;s hand and the Cross on the vestment, and then withdraws to vest. Any server who has not been tonsured must remove the sticharion when he receives Holy Communion, because communicants receive the Mysteries according to their order within the Church (so tonsured clergy vest while laymen remove their vestments). Before divesting at the end of the service, the server must receive the priest&#x27;s blessing.

The minimum age varies by local circumstance, but boys must be mature enough to carry out their duties without disrupting the sanctity of the altar. Although it is common in North America for boys to act as altar servers, in some places this practice is virtually unknown and these duties are always carried out by adult men. In other places where altar servers are normally boys, adult men will not vest if called upon to serve. In yet other places, boys are not permitted to serve in the Altar on reaching their teens on the grounds that the young man is no longer innocent enough to serve in the altar. 

Altar servers, regardless of age, are subject to all the normal restrictions for those not of higher clerical position. Anyone who is bleeding, or has an open sore, is not permitted to enter the altar. They may not touch the altar table or anything on it under any circumstances, nor the prothesis without a blessing. They may not touch the sacred vessels, the chalice and diskos (paten) at any time. They may not stand directly in front of the altar table or pass between the front of it and the iconostasis, but must cross between the altar and the High Place if they need to move to the opposite side.

In general, women do not serve in the altar except in women&#x27;s monasteries. In that case they do not receive the clerical tonsure (though they must be tonsured nuns), and do not vest in the sticharion, but wear their normal religious habit for attending services, and serve at a certain distance from the actual altar table. Normally, only older nuns may serve in the altar; but the Hegumenia (Abbess) is permitted to enter even if she is younger. A few parishes have begun to use women as altar servers.

== Anglican Church ==
In Anglo-Catholic and some Episcopal Churches, the vast majority of roles associated with an altar server are the same as those in the Catholic Church, and the same titles for each individual role are retained from Catholic tradition – mostly restored during the Oxford Movement in the 19th century.

Unlike the Roman Church, lay servers and sacristans were not conferred into the minor order, as defined by the  Council of Trent. These orders were not continued in the Anglican tradition.

==Other churches==

In many Lutheran churches, all who serve in the above positions are called acolytes.

<text>León Cortés Castro (December 8, 1882 – March 3, 1946) was a Costa Rican politician. He served as President of Costa Rica from 1936 to 1940. During his term he introduced new bank reforms, supported banana plantations in the South Pacific region, and established ports at Quepos and Golfito. His administration is often referred to as the &quot;iron bars and cement administration&quot; because of the various construction projects undertaken during his presidency, including the construction of the former International Airport of La Sabana. He was the last of a series of relatively conservative Presidents. He considered changes to allow him to pursue re-election as President, but ultimately backed down due to a Constitutional ban on consecutive terms. He was succeeded by Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, who ultimately broke with tradition and substantially increased the scope of the social state.

Previously he served as secretary of education from 1929 to 1930, and as secretary of agriculture from 1932 to 1935.

In San José province there is a canton that bears his name and, in San José, a monument to him stands in front of the Costa Rica Art Museum.

Castro was an admirer of Nazi Germany. During his presidency, he appointed Max Effinger, the leader of the Costa Rican chapter of the NSDAP/AO, as the director of immigration. In this position, Effinger restricted immigration for &quot;Non-Aryans&quot;. In particular, he prevented many Polish Jewish refugees from entering Costa Rica.

<text>dbx is a source-level debugger found primarily on Solaris, AIX, IRIX, Tru64 UNIX, Linux and BSD operating systems. It provides symbolic debugging for programs written in C, C++, Fortran, Pascal and Java. Useful features include stepping through programs one source line or machine instruction at a time. In addition to simply viewing operation of the program, variables can be manipulated and a wide range of expressions can be evaluated and displayed.

==History==
dbx was originally developed at University of California, Berkeley, by Mark Linton during the years 1981–1984 and subsequently made its way to various vendors who had licensed BSD.

==Availability==
dbx is provided with AIX, and was also provided with IRIX and Tru64 UNIX.

It is included as part of the Oracle Solaris Studio product from Oracle Corporation, and is supported on both Solaris and Linux. It supports programs compiled with the Oracle Solaris Studio compilers and GCC.

It is also available on IBM z/OS systems, in the UNIX System Services component. dbx for z/OS can debug programs written in C and C++, and can also perform machine level debugging. As of z/OS V1R5, dbx is able to debug programs using the DWARF debug format. z/OS V1R6 added support for debugging 64-bit programs.

GCC removed support for dbx in release 13.

<text>Menahem or Menachem (, &quot;consoler&quot; or &quot;comforter&quot;; &quot;Meniḫîmme&quot; [&quot;me-ni-ḫi-im-me&quot;]; Greek: Μεναέμ &quot;Manaem&quot; in the Septuagint, Μεναέν &quot;Manaen&quot; in Aquila; ; full name: , &quot;Menahem son of Gadi&quot;) was the sixteenth king of the northern Israelite Kingdom of Israel. He was the son of Gadi, and the founder of the dynasty known as the House of Gadi or House of Menahem.

== In the Bible ==
Menahem&#x27;s ten-year reign is told in . When Shallum conspired against and assassinated Zechariah in Samaria, and set himself upon the throne of the northern kingdom, Menahem—who, like Shallum, had served as a captain in Zechariah&#x27;s army—refused to recognize the murderous usurper. Menahem marched from Tirzah to Samaria, about six miles westwards, and laid siege to Samaria. He took the city, murdered Shallum a month into his reign (), and set himself upon the throne. () According to Josephus, he was a general of the army of Israel.

He did brutally suppress a revolt at Tiphsah. He destroyed the city and put all its inhabitants to death, even ripping open the pregnant women. ()

The author of the &quot;Books of Kings&quot; describes his rule as one of cruelty and oppression. The author is apparently synopsizing the &quot;annals of the Kings of Israel&quot;, () and gives scant details of Menahem&#x27;s reign.

== Chronology ==
Menahem became king of Israel in the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Azariah, king of Judah, and reigned for ten years. () According to the chronology of Kautsch, he ruled from 743 BC; according to Schrader, from 745 to 736 BC. William F. Albright has dated his reign from 745 to 738 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 752–742 BC.

Menahem seems to have died a natural death, and was succeeded by his son Pekahiah.

== Tributary of Assyria ==
Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria began his reign in 745 BC, seven years after Menahem had become king of Israel.

During Menahem&#x27;s reign, the Assyrians first entered the kingdom of Israel, and had also invaded Aram Damascus to the north-east: &quot;And Pul, king of the Assyrians, came into the land&quot;. () The Assyrians may have been invited into Israel by the Assyrian party. Hosea speaks of the two anti-Israelite parties, the Egyptian and Assyrian. ()

To maintain independence, Menahem was forced to pay a tribute of a thousand talents of silver ()—which is about 37 tons (about 34 metric tons) of silver. It is now generally accepted that Pul referred to in is Tiglath-Pileser III of the cuneiform inscriptions. Pul was probably his personal name and the one that first reached Israel. Tiglath-Pileser records this tribute in one of his inscriptions (&quot;ANET 283&quot;).
To pay the tribute, Menahem exacted fifty shekels of silver—about 1 pounds or 0.6 kg—from all the mighty men of wealth of the kingdom. () To collect this amount, there would have had to be at the time some 60,000 &quot;that were mighty and rich&quot; in the kingdom. After receiving the tribute, Tiglath-Pileser returned to Assyria. However, from that time the kingdom of Israel was a tributary of Assyria; and when Pekah some ten years later refused to pay any more tribute, it started a sequence of events which led to the destruction of the kingdom and the deportation of its population.

<text>The Lost Road and Other Writings – Language and Legend before ″The Lord of the Rings″ is the fifth volume, published in 1987, of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, a series of compilations of drafts and essays written by J. R. R. Tolkien in around 1936–1937. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher.

== Book ==

=== Contents ===

&quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; contains the following pieces:

# &quot;The Early History of the Legend&quot; — an introduction to the following two pieces, detailing how Tolkien&#x27;s correspondence with C. S. Lewis led to the writing of &quot;The Lost Road&quot;.
# &quot;The Fall of Númenor&quot; — an early draft of what would become the &quot;Akallabêth&quot;.
# &quot;The Lost Road&quot; — an unfinished time-travel story written in late 1936 that connects Tolkien&#x27;s other tales to the 20th century.
# The later &quot;Annals of Beleriand&quot;.
# The later &quot;Annals of Valinor&quot;.
# The &quot;Ainulindalë&quot; — an early version of the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot; (the &quot;Music of the Ainur&quot;).
# &quot;The Lhammas&quot; (&quot;Account of Tongues&quot;) — an overview of the various languages of Middle-earth.
# &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; — a draft of the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;.
# &quot;The Etymologies&quot; — an etymological dictionary of the Elvish tongues, contemporary with writings up to that time.
# Appendix
## The Genealogies
## The List of Names
## The Second &quot;Silmarillion&quot; Map

=== Inscription ===

The title page of each volume of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; has an inscription in Tengwar, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Volume V reads &quot;Herein are collected the oldest Tale of the Downfall of Númenor, the story of the Lost Road into the West, the Annals of Valinor and the Annals of Beleriand in a later form, the &quot;Ainulindalë&quot;, or Music of the Ainur, the Lhammas, or Account of Tongues, the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; or History of the Silmarils, and the history of many words and names.&quot;

== Approach ==

&quot;The Lost Road&quot; itself was the result of a joint decision by Tolkien and C. S. Lewis to make attempts at writing science fiction. Lewis ended up writing a story about space travel, which eventually became &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot;, and Tolkien tried to write something about time travel, but never completed it. &quot;The Lost Road&quot; is a fragmentary beginning of a tale, with a rough outline and several pieces of narrative, including four chapters dealing with modern England and Númenor, from which the entire story may be glimpsed. The scheme was for time travel by means of &quot;vision&quot; or being mentally inserted into what had been so as to experience that which had happened. In this way the tale links the 20th century first to the Saxon England of Alfred the Great, then to the Lombard king Alboin of St Benedict&#x27;s time, the Baltic Sea during the Viking Age, Ireland at the time of the Tuatha Dé Danann&#x27;s coming (600 years after Noah&#x27;s Flood), the prehistoric North in the Ice Age, a &quot;Galdor story&quot; of Middle-earth in the Third Age, and finally the Fall of Gil-galad, before recounting the prime legend of the Downfall of Númenor and the Bending of the World.

The story starts with Alboin, a child in 20th century Britain who has strange visions referencing the First and Second Ages of Middle-earth after talking to his father Oswin about his 6th century namesake, where he sees the clouds coming westwards over the Atlantic as resembling the great eagles of Manwë traveling to Númenor. Many years later as an adult, the dreams return to him as he starts to realize that they are actual memories from his ancestors, which he wishes he could see for himself. Fulfilling this wish, Elendil appears to him in another one of his dreams, offering to take him and his son Audoin to some time from the 3260s to the 3310s of the Second Age, which he accepts. The view of the distant past begins a conversation on the shores of Númenor about the state of the kingdom. Elendil tells his son Herendil that he is a member of the faithful who still support the Valar, trying to convince him of Sauron&#x27;s corruption and negative influence over the king Tarkalion (Ar-Pharazôn). Herendil argues that Sauron has enlightened the Númenorians after his imprisonment and ascension to being the king&#x27;s advisor, portraying the Valar as villains for keeping immortality from the species of men. 

Elendil tells him the true history of Arda up until that point where mortality was a gift rather than a curse, and discusses how militaristic Númenor is becoming, despite not having any enemies, to foreshadow the attempted invasion of Aman. Herendil agrees to join the rebellion against Sauron in the safety of their house. The story breaks off at the end of the fourth chapter. The novel explores the theme of the &quot;Straight Road&quot; into the West, now open only in memory because the world has become round.

Tolkien reworked and expanded some of the time travel ideas from &quot;The Lost Road&quot; in &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;, which was also left unfinished.

== Reception ==

The Tolkien scholar Wayne G. Hammond, writing in &quot;Mallorn&quot; in 1995, comments that reactions to Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s works are split &quot;between those who find the series a tribute to his father&#x27;s imagination, and those who merely ask &quot;Why?&quot;&quot; He quotes Valerie Housden&#x27;s 1988 review of &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; from &quot;Vector&quot; as &quot;typical&quot;: &quot;A must for Tolkien freaks and those preparing doctorates, my cat and I agreed this book was a good excuse for a snooze on a rainy afternoon.&quot; Hammond replies that the &quot;fan response&quot; to &quot;The History of the Lord of the Rings&quot; implies a wider market than that.

Taum Santoski, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, writes that the volume, with such items as &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, demonstrates Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;deep interest ... in revising his languages&quot;. He notes Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s comment that his father &quot;was perhaps more interested in the processes of [linguistic] change than he was in displaying the structure and use of the languages at any given time.&quot; Noting that people who wanted definitive forms of Quenya and Sindarin &quot;will be disappointed&quot;, Santoski observes that the alternative forms of words, such as &quot;nume&quot; and &quot;numen&quot; (&quot;West&quot;) are both &quot;real&quot;. He comments that it is precisely &quot;this incompleteness that makes all of the work of Tolkien so attractive&quot;. Santoski remarks, too, that in 1937, when &quot;The Hobbit&quot; had been published, &quot;the currents of Tolkien&#x27;s imagination&quot; were evidently moving towards &quot;a fusion&quot;: the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; was approaching completion; the languages had progressed; and his readers wanted a &quot;new &quot;Hobbit&quot;&quot;. Santoski remarks that &quot;Fortunately Mr. Baggins ... had a nephew.&quot;

<text>Pekahiah (; &quot;Pəqaḥyā&quot;; &quot;YHWH has opened the eyes&quot;; ) was the seventeenth and antepenultimate king of Israel and the son of Menahem, whom he succeeded, and the second and last king of Israel from the House of Gadi. He ruled from the capital of Samaria.

Pekahiah became king in the fiftieth year of the reign of Uzziah, king of Judah. William F. Albright has dated his reign to 738–736 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 742–740 BCE.

Pekahiah is stated to have done evil in the eyes of Yahweh. He continued the practices of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which are called the sins of Jeroboam. In other words, he worshiped at the golden calves which Jeroboam had built at Bethel and at Dan, and continued to promote the corrupted priesthood which Jeroboam had founded.

After a reign of two years, Pekahiah was assassinated in the royal citadel at Samaria by Pekah ben Remaliah, one of his own chief military officers – with the help of fifty men from Gilead. Pekah succeeded Pekahiah as king.

<text>Zechariah ( &quot;Zəḵaryā&quot;, meaning &quot;remembered by Yah&quot;; also &quot;Zachariah&quot;, &quot;Zacharias&quot;; ) was the fourteenth king of the northern Israelite Kingdom of Israel, and son of Jeroboam II.

Zechariah became king of Israel in Samaria in the thirty-eighth year of Azariah, king of Judah. () William F. Albright has dated his reign to 746 BC – 745 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 753 BC – 752 BC.

According to the Bible, Zechariah did what was evil in the Lord&#x27;s sight, as the previous kings of Israel since Jeroboam I had done.

<text>Herbert Lange (29 September 1909 – 20 April 1945) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. He was commandant of Chełmno extermination camp until April 1942, as well as leader of the &quot;SS Special Detachment Lange&quot; conducting the murder of Jews from the Łódź Ghetto. Lange was responsible for numerous crimes against humanity, including the murder of mentally disabled patients in Poland and in Germany during the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; &quot;euthanasia&quot; programme, and became one of the key originators of the Holocaust.

== Biography ==
Lange studied law, but failed to obtain a degree and he subsequently joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) on 1 May 1932. He enlisted in the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) three months later, and the following year, he joined the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). He subsequently joined the police force, becoming a deputy commissioner in 1935.

== Crimes against humanity ==
Lange entered Poland with &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; Naumann (EG VI) during the September campaign. On 9 November 1939, following a Nazi German victory, Lange was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; (2nd lieutenant) in occupied Poland and posted in charge of the Gestapo in occupied Poznań. In the beginning of 1940 he assumed command of an &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Lange,&quot; named after him and tasked with the murder of mentally ill in Wartheland area (Wielkopolska) under the direction of &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Ernst Damzog and &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Wilhelm Koppe. Lange served with Einsatzgruppe VI during Operation Tannenberg. Already by mid-1940, he and his men were responsible for the murder of about 1,100 patients in Owińska, 2,750 patients at Kościan, 1,558 patients and 300 Poles at Działdowo, and hundreds of Poles at Fort VII where the mobile gas-chamber (Einsatzwagen) was invented. Their earlier hospital victims were usually shot in the back of the neck. The unit, equipped with a gas van, shuttled between hospitals, picking up patients and killing them with carbon monoxide.

After his promotion to SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; (1st lieutenant) on 20 April 1940, his unit was permanently stationed at the Soldau concentration camp. In one special case, Wilhelm Rediess hired &quot;Kommando Lange&quot; to kill 1,558 mental patients from East Prussia for ten Reichsmarks a head. By December 1941 Lange was a SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (captain) and was appointed commander of the Chełmno death camp by then SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; Ernst Damzog, chief of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo) and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) in Posen (Poznań).
 He held that position until March 1942. His commando was tasked with the liquidation of 100,000 Jews from the Warthegau via Ghetto Litzmannstadt. In April 1942 Lange&#x27;s unit was renamed SS &quot;Sonderkommando Kulmhof&quot; and introduced improvements to the killing process at Chełmno. Lange constructed cremation pits to replace mass graves. He was succeeded by Hans Bothmann who formed Special Detachment Bothmann in 1942. At a very minimum 152,000 people (Bohn) were killed at the camp, though the West German prosecution, citing Nazi figures during the Chełmno trials of 1962–65, laid charges for at least 180,000 victims.

Upon the completion of his task in 1942 Lange was transferred to the &quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; (Reich Main Security Office) and served under Arthur Nebe as a Kriminalrat (Criminal Investigator). He was transferred to the Balkans to participate in Nazi security warfare against alleged partisans. In March 1944 Lange returned to the already inactive death camp at Chełmno, and resumed the gassing operations on the request of Arthur Greiser, for the final ten transports of ghettoised Jews. In 1944, Lange aided in catching the conspirators who attempted to assassinate Hitler as part of the 20 July Plot, leading to his promotion to SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;. One of the conspirators he interrogated was Peter Bielenberg. In her book &quot;The Past Is Myself&quot;, Peter Bielenberg&#x27;s wife Christabel Bielenberg describes her own interrogation by Lange.

Lange was killed in action at Bernau bei Berlin during the Battle of Berlin on 20 April 1945.

<text>Romualdo Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno (February 6, 1859 – January 4, 1945) served as president of Costa Rica on three occasions: 1910–1914, 1924–1928 and 1932–1936.

The son of two-time president Jesús Jiménez, Ricardo Jiménez was one of the best known lawyers in Costa Rican history and a University of Santo Tomás graduate. Shortly before assuming power in 1910, the province of Cartago was hit by a powerful earthquake which destroyed most of the city and killed hundreds. One of his main struggles was the rebuilding of the biggest city in the country at the time. After the earthquake, Jiménez outlawed construction with adobe. Another notable aspect of his first term was the consolidation of the country&#x27;s external debt with a great part of the debt owed to France being repaid.

During his second term in office, he created the National Insurance Bank, The Bank of Mortgage Credit, the School of Agriculture and founded the Ministry of Health. He also began the electrification of the Pacific railway system and the creation of the Pacific port of Puntarenas. After his second term, he stepped away from the political scene for four years.

He was again elected President in 1932. During his last term in office he concentrated on the country&#x27;s infrastructure and educational system. He built several large buildings for school housing, improved and built new roads throughout the country and constructed an aqueduct system that started in the central valley at Ojo de Agua that flowed into the Pacific Ocean at Puntarenas. During his administration, the bridge from Filadelfia and Liberia was constructed, as was the Old National Theater. He died in San José on 4 January 1945.

<text>Tibni ( &quot;Tīḇnī&quot;) was a claimant to the throne of Israel and the son of Ginath. Albright has dated his reign to 876–871 BC, while Thiele offers the dates 885–880 BC.

==Ancestry==
Tomoo Ishida instead suggested that the narrative of dynastic instability in the Kingdom of Israel suggests an underlying rivalry between tribes for its throne. In the biblical narrative, the House of Jeroboam was from the Tribe of Ephraim, while the House of Baasha was from the Tribe of Issachar. The Omrides are connected in this narrative with the city of Jezreel, where they maintained a second palace. According to the Book of Joshua, Jezreel was controlled by the Tribe of Issachar. Ishida views the narrative as suggesting that the Omrides themselves were members of the Tribe of Issachar. The assassinated king Elah and Omri thus shared a &quot;common tribal origin&quot;, and were possibly kinsmen. Omri and the Tribe of Issachar&#x27;s opposition to Zimri indicates that Zimri was not a member of their tribe.

Ishida views both Zimri and his successor Tibni as likely members of the Tribe of Ephraim, its candidates in an attempt to reclaim the throne. But he also suggests another hypothesis, that Tibni originated from the city of Gina (also known as Beth-haggan) mentioned in the Amarna letters (14th century BC). In the Biblical narrative, this city was under the control of the Tribe of Manasseh. So Tibni could instead be the Tribe of Manasseh&#x27;s candidate for the throne.

Similarly, genealogist David Hughes speculated that Zimri and Tibni were members of the Tribe of Ephraim, and siblings to each other. He further speculated that they were descendants of Hoshea, son of Azaziah, one of the rulers of the Tribe of Ephraim. Hoshea and Azaziah are characters briefly mentioned in the Books of Chronicles (I Chronicles 27:20), where Hoshea is a contemporary of David:
==In the Bible==
After Zimri had ended his life after a reign of seven days, the people of Israel were divided into two factions, one siding with Omri, and the other with Tibni. They and their forces fought each other for several years until Omri&#x27;s forces prevailed and Tibni&#x27;s death. It appears that Tibni was regent over half the kingdom of Israel for a period of four years. Tibni had a brother named Joram, who seconded him in the dispute over the throne and who died at the same time as himself, probably at the hands of Omri&#x27;s party; however he is only mentioned in the LXX version of 1 Kings 16:22. Tibni&#x27;s death is recorded but not explained.

==Name==
It was suggested that Tibni is a nickname meaning &quot;man of straw&quot;.

<doc id="435965" wikidata="Q743625" url="?curid=435965" title="Willie Mosconi">
<text>William Joseph Mosconi (; June 27, 1913 – September 17, 1993) was an American professional pool player from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mosconi is widely considered one of the greatest pool players of all time. Between the years of 1941 and 1957, he won the World Straight Pool Championship nineteen times. For most of the 20th century, his name was essentially synonymous with pool in North America – he was nicknamed &quot;Mr. Pocket Billiards&quot; – and he was among the first Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame inductees. Mosconi pioneered and regularly employed numerous trick shots, set many records, and helped to popularize pool as a national recreation activity.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the pocket billiards game most often played in competition was called straight pool, or 14.1 continuous, a form of pool considered by most top players to be more difficult than today&#x27;s fast tournament game nine-ball. Mosconi set the officially-recognized straight pool high world record of 526 consecutive balls in 1954.

==Early life==
Mosconi&#x27;s family lived above a pool hall that William&#x27;s father, Joseph Mosconi, owned. Despite that, Joseph was strongly opposed to his son playing pocket billiards, preferring he become a Vaudeville performer like his cousins, the dancers Charles and Louis Mosconi. He tried to keep his young son away from the game by hiding the billiard balls, but Willie improvised by practicing with an old broomstick and small potatoes from his mother&#x27;s kitchen.

The young Mosconi was a prodigy and his father soon realized that he could use his son&#x27;s talent to help earn money for their growing family. Joseph Mosconi began advertising challenge matches, and though Willie had to stand on a box in order to reach the table, he beat experienced players many years his senior.

In 1919, an exhibition match was arranged between six-year-old Mosconi and the reigning World Champion, Ralph Greenleaf. The hall was packed, and though Greenleaf won that match, Mosconi played well enough to draw considerable attention and launch his professional career.

==Tournaments and exhibitions==
In 1924, at the age of 11, Mosconi was the juvenile straight pool champion and was regularly holding trick shot exhibitions. By the early 1930s, Mosconi had taken a brief hiatus from the game, but returned a few years later in the hopes of earning some money.

Upon his return, Mosconi entered one local tournament after another and according to his autobiography, &quot;Willie&#x27;s Game&quot;, he won them all. After a short while, Mosconi was making a living as a professional pool player. Willie claimed he never hustled anyone, beating everyone honestly: &quot;I played everyone straight&quot;.

In 1933, Mosconi competed in the Billiard Congress of America (BCA) World Straight Pool Championship. Erwin Rudolph won the title and Willie came in 5th place.

His performance garnered the attention of the president of Brunswick Corporation who immediately hired the young phenom. That same year, Mosconi embarked on a hectic cross-country exhibition tour promoting Brunswick products. Mosconi was joined by his idol and then World Champion Ralph Greenleaf, who was at the top of his game. In the end the scoreline read 57 wins for Greenleaf and a close 50 for the 20-year-old Mosconi.

From 1940 to 1941, a round-robin tournament series was sponsored by billiard halls, with eight invitational players. Mosconi was sponsored by a hall in New York City called McGirr&#x27;s. He dominated this series, and ran 125 balls from the five times, being one of the first players to achieve this feat at the time.

In 1944, Mosconi enlisted in the United States Army, having already spent several years working within the defense industry. When World War II ended, he returned to a successful tournament career and renewed his affiliation with Brunswick.

After suffering a stroke in 1956, Mosconi slowed down on his tournament appearances in order to recover. In 1958 Mosconi made a return and won the National Invitational Tournament defeating Jimmy Moore.

Mosconi retired from tournament play in 1966, after once again making it to the final of the World Straight Pool Championship but losing to Joe Balsis. He remained active in promoting the game and consulted and appeared in several movies dealing with billiards, made game show appearances and wrote many articles on billiards, as well as co-authored some books. A feud with pool hustler Rudolf &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; Wanderone (concocted mainly by Wanderone himself) kept Mosconi in the spotlight well into the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1974, Mosconi competed against Rex Williams in a challenge match, where both players competed in snooker and in various pocket billiards games in a 17 day competition, to conclude the winner. The 60 year old Mosconi won the challenge, winning 7 out of the 18 games in snooker, while dominating in straight pool, nine-ball, eight-ball, one-pocket, and bank pool. Mosconi earned $15,000 for winning the challenge match, which was the largest first place prize in cue sports at the time.

== As an author ==
Mosconi authored an autobiography titled &quot;Willie&#x27;s Game&quot;, published in 1993.

He and a ghost writer authored an instructional book on pocket billiards entitled &quot;Willie Mosconi on Pocket Billiards&quot;. In the book he offers advice on fundamentals, includes photographs and diagrams on shotmaking and provides straight pool strategies. The book was published originally [number 121 in the Little Sports Library series] by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company of Chicago &amp; New York in July 1948. It was reissued by Crown Publishers of New York in 1959. A second ghost-written book (which on some finer points contradicts &quot;On Pocket Billiards&quot;) was also published under his name.

== 526 high run ==
Mosconi set the world record by running 526 consecutive balls without a miss during a straight pool exhibition in Springfield, Ohio on March 19–20, 1954. A handwritten and notarized affidavit with the signatures of more than 35 eyewitnesses exists as proof of this feat. The record has been surpassed, with 626 consecutive balls run by John Schmidt on May 27, 2019, recorded on a videotape. Critics have argued that Mosconi&#x27;s record was made in competition while Schmidt simply set up break shots for himself, and that his video was never released. In similar fashion to Schmidt, on January 18, 2022 as part of the &quot;Legends of Pocket Billiards&quot; high run series, Jayson Shaw completed a 51-rack record-breaking run of 714, however, after review of the unedited video by a BCA committee of 5 people it was noted that on the 45th ball, Jayson Shaw inadvertently touched an object ball. The outing was certified as a run of 669.

Mosconi&#x27;s record was set on a 4 × 8 foot Brunswick table with 5 1/4 inch corner pockets at the East High Billiard Club. Schmidt&#x27;s run was on a 4 1/2 by 9 foot table which is more difficult in the sense that longer shots are required but which is easier to play on in the sense that there is more room for the balls to spread, creating unfettered shots. Mosconi competed successfully on 4 1/2 × 9 and even 5 x 10 ft tables.

== &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961) ==
Mosconi was the technical advisor on the 1961 film &quot;The Hustler&quot;, starring Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott, and Piper Laurie. The movie played a major part in the boom in the popularity of pool. Mosconi&#x27;s job was to teach Newman how to walk, talk, and shoot like a real pool hustler. Newman had never even picked up a pool cue before filming, but Mosconi&#x27;s instruction helped to hide Newman&#x27;s inexperience. According to Mosconi, Gleason was already skilled at billiards, and Mosconi recommended Gleason for the role of the original &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot;.

Mosconi also had a cameo role as himself, acting as a holder during the first match-up between the film&#x27;s characters &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson and &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot;. Gleason can be heard saying &quot;Willie, hang on to that&quot; when the match commences. At various points in the extended scene, Mosconi can be seen in the audience watching the match.

Mosconi also had a cameo role as himself in George Thorogood&#x27;s official video for his song &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot;.

== Filmography ==
1937: &quot;Super Cue Men&quot;, a short feature starring Mosconi, Jimmy Caras and Joi Lansing.

1966: An episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Dead Spy Scrawls&quot; {1/18}, featured actor Harry Bartell in the role of &quot;Willie Marconi,&quot; trying to teach Maxwell Smart how to play pool. While some have erroneously believed this is a cameo of Willie Mosconi playing himself, the Marconi character is a fictitious but obvious tribute to Mosconi, who is acknowledged by The Chief as &quot;the greatest pool player in the world.&quot;

February 25, 1978: &quot;The Great Pool Shoot-Out&quot;, a US$15,000 match between Rudolf &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; Wanderone, Jr. and Mosconi at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.

Aired on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; with commentator Howard Cosell and referee Charles Ursitti.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s: Mosconi made several other television appearances competing in challenge matches with other legends such as Jimmy Caras, Luther Lassiter, Irving Crane, Joe Balsis and &quot;Fats&quot; Wanderone. Many of these shows aired on ABC and the fledgling ESPN network.

May 9, 1980: Mosconi played a sportscaster in the film &quot;The Baltimore Bullet&quot; starring James Coburn and Omar Sharif.

1982: He appeared in the music video for George Thorogood&#x27;s &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot;, as a spectator and betting on Bo Diddley&#x27;s character.

August 10, 1991: Mosconi played his last challenge match, against Jimmy Caras at the Valley Billiards Hall of Fame tribute dinner show. The event was hosted by billiard artists the Birkbeck Twins at the Williamson Restaurant in Horsham, Pennsylvania. Both players were stopped every couple of for interviews.

His story was also featured in an episode of Mysteries at the Museum.

== Legacy ==

In 1994, the Mosconi Cup, an annual pool competition between American and European players, was founded in his honor. The event has been held every year since then.

In 2006, Mosconi was posthumously honored with membership in the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="435979" wikidata="Q2276661" url="?curid=435979" title="Halictidae">
<text>Halictidae is the second-largest family of bees (clade Anthophila) with nearly 4,500 species. They are commonly called sweat bees (especially the smaller species), as they are often attracted to perspiration. Halictid species are an extremely diverse group that can vary greatly in appearance. These bees occur all over the world and are found on every continent except Antarctica. Usually dark-colored (frequently brown or black) and often metallic, halictids are found in various sizes, colors and patterns. Several species are all or partly green and a few are red, purple, or blue. A number of them have yellow markings, especially the males, which commonly have yellow faces, a pattern widespread among the various families of bees. The family is one of many with short tongues and is best distinguished by the arcuate (strongly curved) basal vein found on the wing. Females in this family tend to be larger than the males. They are the group for which the term &#x27;eusocial&#x27; was first coined by entomologist, Suzanne Batra.

==Ecology==

Most halictids nest in the ground, often in habitats like clay soil and river banks, though a few nest in wood. They mass-provision their young; a mass of pollen and nectar is formed inside a waterproof cell, an egg laid upon it, and the cell sealed off, so the larva is given all of its food at one time, as opposed to &quot;progressive provisioning&quot;, where a larva is fed repeatedly as it grows, as in honey bees. Some species line their tunnels with lactone secretions to help workers return to the nest. It is thought that each individual bee has its own unique chemical signature. All species (except for kleptoparasites) are pollen feeders and may be important pollinators.
=== Eusociality ===

Many species in the Halictidae are eusocial at least in part, such as &quot;Lasioglossum malachurum&quot;, with fairly well-defined queen and worker castes (though not the same as the caste system in honey bees), and certain manifestations of their social behavior appear to be facultative in various lineages. The first group of offspring continues to build and protect the nest as well as gather food for a new brood of larvae. An impressive variety of social and nesting behaviors are exhibited by halictids including solitary, communal, semi-social and primitively eusocial. Different biotic and abiotic factors can even affect these behaviors such as floral resources, location, altitude, season, and climate.

Those species which do not have a permanent, rigid, division of labor, such as &quot;Lasioglossum zephyrus&quot; or &quot;Halictus rubicundus&quot;, are considered primitively eusocial. Another example of a primitive eusocial bee species from this family is &quot;Halictus ligatus&quot;, for which aggression is one of the most influential behavioral attitudes for establishing hierarchy and social organization within the colony. Primitively eusocial species such as these provide insight into the early evolution of eusociality. &quot;Halictus sexcinctus&quot;, which exhibits social, communal, and eusocial organization, provides insight into the evolutionary reversal of eusociality. Phylogenetic data from this species suggests that a communal strategy serves as a transitional step between eusociality and a reversion back to solitary nesting.

=== Kleptoparasitism===

Several genera and species of halictids are kleptoparasites of other bees (mostly other halictids or bees of similar size). The behavior has evolved at least nine times independently within the family. The most well-known and common are species in the genus &quot;Sphecodes&quot;, which are somewhat wasp-like in appearance (often shining black with blood-red abdomen- German: &quot;Blutbienen&quot; - usually 4–9 mm in body length); the female &quot;Sphecodes&quot; enters the cell with the provision mass, eats the host egg, and lays an egg of her own in its place.

=== &quot;Nocturnal&quot; species ===

Halictidae is one of the four bee families that contain some crepuscular species; these halictids are active only at dusk or in the early evening, so are technically considered &quot;vespertine&quot; (e.g. in the subgenus &quot;Sphecodogastra&quot; of &quot;Lasioglossum&quot;), or sometimes truly nocturnal (e.g. in the genus &quot;Megalopta&quot;, such as the species &quot;M. genalis&quot;). These bees, as is typical in such cases, have greatly enlarged ocelli. The other families with some crepuscular species are Andrenidae, Colletidae, and Apidae.

== Economic importance ==

Some Halictids are important in the pollination of crops. Among these are the alkali bee, &quot;Lasioglossum vierecki&quot; and &quot;Lasioglossum leucozonium&quot;. While some halictid species are oligoleges (e.g., &quot;Rophites algirus&quot;, which only visits the flowers of hedgenettle plants.), most are generalists making them potentially valuable overall pollinators.

== Stinging ==
Only females have the ability to deliver a sting. Due to their non-aggressive nature, they are only likely to sting if disturbed; the sting is minor. The most common instances of stinging occur from swatting at or accidentally making contact with a halictid trying to get a lick of one&#x27;s sweat, seeking the dissolved electrolytes.

== Phylogeny ==

Halictidae belongs to the hymenopteran subclade Aculeata (stinging Hymenoptera), superfamily Apoidea (bees and wasps), series Anthophila (true bees). Fossils from this family are typically found in amber from the Baltic Region and the Dominican Republic and imply that Halictidae have existed since at least 96-75 million years ago. The oldest fossil record of Halictidae dates back to Early Eocene with a number of species, such as &quot;Neocorynura electra&quot; and &quot;Augochlora leptoloba&quot; known from amber deposits. Currently, the family is divided into four subfamilies, many genera, and more than 2000 known species. Rophitinae appears to be the sister group to the remaining three subfamilies (Nomiinae, Nomioidinae, Halictinae) based on both morphology and molecular data.

<text>William Scott Goldberg (born December 27, 1966), often known mononymously as Goldberg, is an American professional wrestler, actor and former American football defensive tackle. He is signed to WWE, where he is set to retire in 2025. He is best known for his tenure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

One of the most popular figures of the professional wrestling boom during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Goldberg rose to fame in WCW with a lengthy undefeated streak in singles competition from 1997 to 1998, became the highest paid WCW wrestler, and led the company as its franchise player and public face until it was sold to WWE. During his time with WCW, he became a one-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, and one-time WCW World Tag Team Champion (with Bret Hart). Along with Hart, he is the fifth WCW Triple Crown winner.

Following WCW&#x27;s closure in 2001, Goldberg wrestled for All Japan Pro Wrestling between 2002 and 2003 and for WWE between 2003 and 2004, becoming a one-time World Heavyweight Champion in the latter. After 12 years away from wrestling, he returned to WWE in 2016, winning the WWE Universal Championship for the first time in 2017 and a second time in 2020. He has headlined multiple WCW and WWE pay-per-view events, including WCW&#x27;s premier annual event Starrcade (in 1998 and 1999). He headlined the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018 and is a five-time world champion in his career between WWE and WCW, with WWE counting his world title win at the 1999 Halloween Havoc. He is also the only wrestler to have won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, WWE&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship, and the WWE Universal Championship.

Before he became a professional wrestler, Goldberg was a professional American football player. Following his first retirement from wrestling in 2004, he began working as a commentator for the mixed martial arts promotion Elite Xtreme Combat before it closed down. He hosted 26 episodes of &quot;Garage Mahal&quot; on the DIY Network from 2009 to 2011 and has acted in various films and television shows, including &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

== Early life ==
William Scott Goldberg was born into a Reform Jewish family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on December 27, 1966, the son of classical violinist Ethel and OB-GYN Jed Goldberg. He is of Russian-Jewish and Romanian-Jewish descent, with his Romanian-born great-grandfather having relocated to the U.S. from Bucharest through Ellis Island. His father was a graduate of both Harvard and Johns Hopkins University. His parents later divorced, and his father died in late 2006. His mother breeds flowers and created an award-winning hybrid orchid in 2000, which she named after Goldberg. He has two brothers. Goldberg had his Bar Mitzvah at a Reform synagogue, Temple Israel, in his hometown. He attended Tulsa Edison High School. He acquired a love for football early in his life and, due to his large stature, began working as a nightclub bouncer at the age of 16.

== Football career ==
Goldberg earned a scholarship to attend the University of Georgia and play college football for the Georgia Bulldogs as a defensive tackle. He was taken by the Los Angeles Rams in the 11th round of the 1990 NFL draft, with the 301st overall selection but never appeared in any games for the Rams. He made his NFL debut on December 3, 1992, for the Atlanta Falcons wearing #71 and played with them through 1994. He became close with Deion Sanders during this time. Goldberg also had a stint with the Sacramento Surge of the WLAF in 1992 and Sacramento Gold Miners of the Canadian Football League in 1993. He was cut from the Falcons in 1995, so he was selected by the new expansion team the Carolina Panthers in the 1995 NFL expansion draft. He never played a game with the team, as he was the first player to have been cut by the Panthers.

Goldberg&#x27;s NFL career ended when he &quot;tore his lower abdomen off his pelvis&quot;. He explained that he hoped to return to the league after rehabilitation but was not considered a major asset due to his lack of success. The NFL was &quot;a mixed emotional experience&quot; for him because he did not attain the level of success on the field that he desired, despite reaching the goal of simply playing in the league.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== World Championship Wrestling (1997–2001) ===
==== Training and matches (1997) ====
During his after-NFL rehab, Goldberg began powerlifting and mixed martial arts training when he was spotted by Lex Luger and Sting; both convinced him to try professional wrestling. He was not a fan of professional wrestling. Seeing it as an alternative to his fledgling football career, he began training at the WCW Power Plant.

Goldberg made five appearances, working as Bill Gold during this part of his career. His first-ever official wrestling match was in a &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; dark match on June 23, 1997, in Macon, Georgia defeating Buddy Lee Parker. He also faced and defeated Buddy Landell, Hugh Morrus, Chip Minton, and John Betcha. His final pre-televised appearance was in a dark match at a &quot;Saturday Night&quot; taping on July 24 when losing to Chad Fortune.

==== Undefeated streak (1997–1998) ====

On the September 22, 1997, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Goldberg defeated Hugh Morrus in his debut match. Soon afterward, he began to score quick victories over his fellow WCW wrestlers in a range of 1–2 minutes. Goldberg had a succession of wins, and he advanced up the card and was pushed as a singles wrestler. The newcomer captivated fans with his monstrous yet silent charisma, brute strength, and agility, and he vaulted the ropes, performed high kicks, and performed the occasional backflip. Goldberg made his first pay-per-view appearance at Halloween Havoc by helping Alex Wright defeat Steve McMichael and then received McMichael&#x27;s Super Bowl XX championship ring from McMichael&#x27;s wife Debra. Goldberg proceeded to attack Wright with it. Goldberg&#x27;s attack on McMichael led to a match between the two in Goldberg&#x27;s first pay-per-view match at Starrcade, which Goldberg won.

In early 1998, Goldberg squashed Brad Armstrong at SuperBrawl VIII and pinned Perry Saturn at Spring Stampede. By mid-March, WCW stopped referring to him by his full name, shortening it to simply &quot;Goldberg&quot;. WCW also began counting Goldberg&#x27;s consecutive wins on television at about this time, and he continued to climb up the ranks. Goldberg&#x27;s win over Saturn was his 74th consecutive without a loss. The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, he challenged Raven for the United States Heavyweight Championship that Raven had won the night before at Spring Stampede. Goldberg was forced to deal with interference from Raven&#x27;s Flock; however, he overpowered them all and defeated Raven to win his first professional wrestling championship. Two days later, on the April 22 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, he made his first successful title defense against Mike Enos. Goldberg then started a feud with Raven and his Flock. At Slamboree, he ended his feud with The Flock, after a successful title defense against Saturn. Goldberg continued to make successful title defenses against Konnan at The Great American Bash and Curt Hennig. By then, he adopted the catchphrase &quot;Who&#x27;s next?&quot;, in reference to his rapidly expanding winning streak.

Goldberg was getting over as a main eventer, and he continued to defend the United States Heavyweight Championship and slowly became a contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship that was held by New World Order (nWo) leader Hollywood Hulk Hogan. Hogan eventually accepted a title match with Goldberg. It was scheduled for the July 6, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta with over 40,000 in attendance, but Hogan insisted that Goldberg first had to defeat his nWo stablemate Scott Hall. Goldberg won and also able to defeat Hogan later in the evening to become the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in turn vacating his United States Heavyweight Championship. At Road Wild, Goldberg won a battle royal, consisting of nWo members. Despite still being the world champion, Goldberg did not have a match at Fall Brawl 1998 and didn&#x27;t even appear on the show. After Diamond Dallas Page became the number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, Goldberg and Page began a feud with each other while both remaining babyfaces. At Halloween Havoc, Goldberg defeated Page to retain the title. They embraced after the match and the program was considered complete. Goldberg states that his match against Page was his favorite match. Much like Fall Brawl, despite still being the world champion, Goldberg again did not have a match at the World War 3 PPV. Goldberg continued rising to fame with this undefeated streak; however, at Starrcade, he lost the title to Kevin Nash after 175 days as the champion and the official count of 173–0 ended, as Scott Hall (disguised as a ringside security guard) made a run-in and shocked Goldberg with a taser gun. Goldberg got his revenge at Souled Out, when he defeated Hall in a ladder taser match. Goldberg won when he used the taser which was hung high above the ring, requiring the ladder to obtain it.

Goldberg&#x27;s win–loss record at WCW events from 1997 to 1998 differed from that which was perpetuated by the company, with the official figure exaggerating the number of matches in which he won to 173. Nick Schwartz of Fox Sports wrote that &quot;No one really knows what Goldberg&#x27;s actual record was... but it&#x27;s generally accepted that 173–0 is an inflated number.&quot; Some of Goldberg&#x27;s industry peers have stated that the figure was exaggerated. His then-WCW colleague Chris Jericho stated that &quot;One week he&#x27;d be 42–0 and seven days later he&#x27;d be 58–0. Did stepping on bugs count?&quot;. Manager Jimmy Hart–who also worked with Goldberg in WCW–regarded a &quot;kind of funny&quot; level of embellishment, while professional wrestler The Miz said &quot;The number would just go on and on and on, to where it was like, &#x27;Wait a second. How did he get this many wins in such a short time&#x27;?&quot;. This exaggeration damaged the streak&#x27;s credibility among the WCW audience–upon noticing that the figure had been falsified, fans made a withdrawal of homemade signs trumpeting Goldberg&#x27;s record.

==== Championship pursuits and final feuds (1999–2001) ====

At Spring Stampede, Goldberg gained his revenge against Nash by defeating him. Then at Slamboree the following month, Goldberg was &quot;injured&quot; in an attack by Rick and Scott Steiner and took some time off to prepare for his film debut in the 1999 film &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot; alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. He returned two months later and defeated Rick Steiner at Road Wild. Goldberg then restarted his feud with DDP also involving Page&#x27;s allies, The Jersey Triad, which culminated in a match at Fall Brawl that Goldberg won. After Goldberg settled his rivalry
with Page, he began focusing on Sid Vicious and challenged him to a match to end Sid&#x27;s winning streak. The two feuded with each other, which culminated in a match at Halloween Havoc for Sid&#x27;s United States Heavyweight title. Goldberg defeated Sid via referee stoppage and thus won his second United States Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, he answered an open challenge from WCW World Heavyweight Champion Sting and defeated him to win the championship. On the next night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, commissioner J. J. Dillon ruled that the match had not been sanctioned by WCW and that, therefore, Goldberg&#x27;s victory was void. Sting, however, was not given the title back due to his attack on a referee during the event and Dillon announced a 32-man tournament for the now vacant title which included Goldberg.

Later that night, Goldberg wrestled against and lost to Bret Hart on the same &quot;Nitro&quot; in the first round of the tournament in a match that also served as the first defense of his newly won United States Heavyweight Championship. Sid Vicious and The Outsiders managed to interfere in the contest and cost Goldberg the title match, thus giving him his second career loss, and eliminating him from the tournament which was eventually won by Hart at Mayhem in November. Goldberg continued his rivalry with Vicious and defeated him in an &quot;I quit&quot; match at Mayhem to close their feud. Shortly thereafter, Goldberg joined forces with Hart, teaming with him to defeat Creative Control for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. One week later, they lost the title to The Outsiders (Scott Hall and Kevin Nash).

At Starrcade, Goldberg challenged Hart for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship; in the course of the match, Goldberg delivered a stiff kick to Hart&#x27;s head, legitimately giving him a concussion and tearing a muscle in his neck. Hart continued on, suffering what he believed to be at least one other concussion when he hit his head on the floor while executing a ringpost-assisted figure-four leglock. The match ended when Roddy Piper, the special guest referee for the contest, declared Hart the winner despite Goldberg never having submitted to the Sharpshooter. Hart vacated the title the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, saying he did not want to win that way and gave Goldberg a rematch. Goldberg was defeated again due to outside interference from Hall and Nash, who came to the ring brandishing baseball bats which they used to attack Goldberg. In a swerve, Hart took one of the bats from The Outsiders and began beating on Goldberg himself, doing enough damage to score the pin and regain his championship. After the match, Hall, Nash, Hart and Jeff Jarrett reformed the nWo and gave Goldberg a new target for a feud that, however, would not last long.

Shortly after his title match loss, Goldberg injured himself on the December 23, 1999 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, during a sequence where he chased the nWo limousine into the parking lot. A spot in the sequence called for Goldberg to pound on the windshield of the limousine with his hands. To ensure his safety, Goldberg had assistance from a piece of metal pipe and his hands were covered in black tape. After this, Goldberg was to break some of the vehicle&#x27;s windows with the pipe. There were four windows on the side of the limousine and Goldberg used the pipe on two of them. He then got aggressive, dropping the pipe and putting his forearm through the third window. A shard of glass sliced an artery in his arm and he began bleeding profusely. The show concluded with Goldberg pounding on the limousine&#x27;s hood, with the television audience able to see the massive amount of blood gushing from his arm as it covered the hood. Immediately after the cameras stopped rolling, medical personnel rushed in to assist the injured Goldberg, who was eventually transported to the hospital for emergency surgery. He lost copious amounts of blood due to the injury and was told that his injury nearly resulted in the amputation of his forearm. The injury caused Goldberg to miss the January 4, 2000 New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) Tokyo Dome show, where he was scheduled to face Manabu Nakanishi. After taking time off to recuperate, Goldberg returned to WCW on the May 29, 2000 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; interfering in a handicap match between Kevin Nash and the team of Tank Abbott and Rick Steiner. At The Great American Bash, Goldberg betrayed Nash during Nash&#x27;s world championship match against Jeff Jarrett and turned into a villain for the first time in his career, aligning himself with The New Blood faction. This did not last long, as Goldberg again was lost to injury and had to miss time. As a result of this betrayal, Goldberg feuded with Nash and defeated him at Bash at the Beach, with help from fellow New Blood member Scott Steiner. Goldberg participated in a triangle number one contender&#x27;s match against Nash and Steiner at New Blood Rising, which Nash won. Goldberg walked out of the match midway through while Nash had him ready for the &quot;Jackknife Powerbomb&quot; and swore at Vince Russo as he left the ring, turning face again. He then began a rivalry with Steiner, culminating in a no disqualification match at Fall Brawl which Goldberg lost due to outside interference.

After his loss to Steiner, Goldberg&#x27;s rivalry with Russo accelerated and in October, having finally had enough, Russo gave Goldberg an ultimatum. If Goldberg was to lose another match at any point in time, unless he managed to duplicate his undefeated streak from 1997 to 1998, he would be forced to retire from professional wrestling. Goldberg defeated KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark) at Halloween Havoc in a handicap elimination match. He then started a feud with Lex Luger. This culminated in a match at Mayhem, which Goldberg won. They continued their rivalry and battled in a rematch at Starrcade. Goldberg won the match, but afterwards he was attacked by Luger&#x27;s partner Buff Bagwell. Goldberg feuded with both Luger and Bagwell, who called themselves &quot;Totally Buffed&quot;. His streak was broken at Sin when Goldberg, teaming with his Power Plant trainer DeWayne Bruce, lost to Totally Buffed in a tag team no disqualification match after a &quot;fan&quot; maced him, enabling Totally Buffed to pin him. The storyline was intended to enable Goldberg to have shoulder surgery, but WCW was sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 2001, while Goldberg was still recuperating. The WWF did not buy out Goldberg&#x27;s contract with AOL Time Warner (the parent company of WCW) as they had done with several other WCW wrestlers, due to Goldberg still being paid out a significant amount of money by AOL Time Warner that he was owed, so he was not involved in the WWF &quot;Invasion&quot; angle. Goldberg instead remained under contract to AOL Time Warner until May 2002, when he agreed on a contract buyout. He was WCW&#x27;s highest paid athlete, alongside Bret Hart, earning $2.5 million per year, a sum which would have risen to $3.5 million in the final year of his contract, due to have expired in July 2003.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2002–2003) ===
Goldberg had suffered an arm injury during the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race at the Long Beach Grand Prix in April 2002. In August 2002, he returned to the ring in Japan. He initially joined All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), defeating Satoshi Kojima and Taiyō Kea. He went on to defeat Rick Steiner in a match for the W-1 promotion and teamed with Keiji Mutoh to defeat KroniK. His success in Japan led to the WWF – now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment – to begin contract negotiations with him.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2004) ===
==== Debut and various feuds (2003) ====
After leaving Japan, Goldberg signed a one-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in March 2003. A promo video announcing his arrival aired during WrestleMania XIX. He debuted the next night on the March 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and started a feud with The Rock by performing a spear on him. Their rivalry intensified when The Rock held a segment entitled &quot;The Rock Concert&quot;, where he taunted Goldberg along with Gillberg, but Goldberg defeated The Rock in his debut match at Backlash on April 27, following three spears and a &quot;Jackhammer&quot;. Goldberg went undefeated over the subsequent half-year, defeating 3-Minute Warning in his first match on &quot;Raw&quot; on May 5. Goldberg defeated Christian the following week on &quot;Raw&quot; in a steel cage match. Goldberg next began a feud with Chris Jericho, culminating in a match between the two at Bad Blood on June 15, which Goldberg won.

====World Heavyweight Championship reign and departure (2003-2004) ====
Goldberg entered a rivalry with Triple H, challenging him for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam on August 24 in the second Elimination Chamber match in WWE. After eliminating Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho, he was pinned by Triple H after Ric Flair threw a sledgehammer inside the chamber and Triple H hit Goldberg with it, meaning Triple H retained the title. Goldberg continued his feud with Triple H and defeated him for the World Heavyweight Championship at Unforgiven on September 21, after agreeing to put his career on the line. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg retained the title against Chris Jericho. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H issued a $100,000 bounty to anybody who could take Goldberg out. Steven Richards, Mark Henry, La Résistance and Tommy Dreamer all attempted to collect the bounty, but they were unsuccessful. On the October 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Batista collected the bounty after he interfered in Goldberg&#x27;s title defense against Shawn Michaels and attacked Goldberg, placing a folding chair around Goldberg&#x27;s ankle and jumping off the middle rope onto the chair, shattering his ankle. Furious, Goldberg demanded a match against Batista, but Triple H got involved in the match by trying to cripple Goldberg, who executed a spear on Triple H and attacked Batista with a sledgehammer. At Survivor Series on November 16, Goldberg retained the title against Triple H despite interference from Evolution. On the November 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg faced Triple H, Randy Orton and Batista in a handicap match, but he was pinned following an &quot;RKO&quot;, &quot;Batista Bomb&quot; and &quot;Pedigree&quot;. After the match, Kane unexpectedly came out to seemingly assist Goldberg after Evolution continued their assault on him following the match. After scaring off Evolution, he turned on Goldberg and executed a chokeslam on him. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane attacked Goldberg again while he was defending the championship against Triple H in a rematch from Survivor Series and expressed his desire to face Goldberg for the title. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff scheduled Goldberg to defend the championship against both Kane and Triple H in a triple threat match at Armageddon. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg teamed with Shawn Michaels and Rob Van Dam to face and defeat Kane, Batista and Orton in a six-man tag team match. On the December 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg faced Kane in a lumberjack match which ended in a disqualification when Evolution and Mark Henry entered the ring and assaulted Goldberg. At Armageddon on December 14, Goldberg lost the World Heavyweight Championship when Triple H pinned him after interference from Evolution and a chokeslam from Kane, thus ending his reign at 84 days.

Survivor Series 2003 marked the first time Goldberg met the WWE Champion Brock Lesnar by interrupting Lesnar after the latter remarked that he could beat anyone in the world. The feud escalated at the 2004 Royal Rumble on January 25, when Goldberg was in the midst of dominating the Royal Rumble match (he eliminated Charlie Haas, Billy Gunn and Nunzio) as the 30th entrant until Lesnar interfered in the match and executed an &quot;F-5&quot; on Goldberg. Angrily distracted at Lesnar&#x27;s attack, Goldberg was eliminated by Kurt Angle. Vowing revenge after defeating Mark Henry and Jonathan Coachman in a no disqualification handicap match the following &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg declared Lesnar his next victim. On the February 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg was given a front row ticket to No Way Out by Stone Cold Steve Austin. SmackDown! general manager Paul Heyman appeared the following week on &quot;Raw&quot; and along with Mr. McMahon attempted to get Goldberg to leave Lesnar alone, but Goldberg executed a spear on Heyman and accidentally executed a spear on Austin when he was aiming for McMahon. Goldberg attended No Way Out as a fan, confronting Lesnar and after several insults by Lesnar, entered the ring and countered an &quot;F-5&quot; from Lesnar with a &quot;Jackhammer&quot;, before being detained and escorted out of the arena by security guards. During the main event between Lesnar and Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 15, Goldberg reemerged from the crowd and cost Lesnar the WWE Championship. Lesnar then demanded a match with Goldberg at WrestleMania XX on March 14, with Austin serving as special guest referee. Fans knew this would be the final WWE match for both Goldberg and Lesnar and thus gave largely negative reactions throughout the performance. Goldberg won the match, causing Lesnar to show Austin and the crowd a middle finger, but he instead received a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; in return and as Goldberg celebrated his victory with Austin, he also received a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;.

=== Legends of Wrestling (2015–2016) ===
Goldberg made his return to professional wrestling on June 7, 2015, at the Legends of Wrestling show at Citi Field in New York. While he was not scheduled to wrestle at the event, Goldberg came to the aid of Rob Van Dam after his match with Scott Steiner. He performed a spear on Steiner and a &quot;Jackhammer&quot; on Doc Gallows.

On January 23, 2016, Goldberg made a second return for the Legends of Wrestling event in Miami, where he delivered another spear to Steiner after his match with Chavo Guerrero.

=== Return to WWE (2016–present) ===
==== Universal Champion and Hall of Fame (2016–2020) ====
On May 31, 2016, Goldberg was announced as the pre-order bonus for the upcoming &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; video game. Throughout the summer, Goldberg and &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; cover star and former rival Brock Lesnar traded insults with each other through social media and WWE 2K events such as Gamescom. Goldberg would also appear at the WWE 2K SummerSlam event the weekend before the pay-per-view event took place, fueling speculation he would be appearing at the event to confront Lesnar. This led to Paul Heyman challenging Goldberg to face Lesnar on the October 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, with Heyman stating that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar&#x27;s WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. The following week on the October 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg returned to WWE for the first time in over 12 years, and accepting Heyman&#x27;s challenge. The match took place at Survivor Series, where Goldberg defeated Lesnar in 1 minute and 26 seconds giving Lesnar his first pinfall loss since April 2013. Months later, Goldberg would participate in the Royal Rumble match on January 29, 2017, where he entered at number 28 and eliminated Lesnar following a brief confrontation and a spear, as well as eliminating Rusev and Luke Harper before being eliminated by The Undertaker.

Lesnar then appeared on the following night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and challenged Goldberg to one final match at WrestleMania 33. Goldberg would go on to accept Lesnar&#x27;s challenge on the February 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and, on the same episode, also earned a match against Kevin Owens for the WWE Universal Championship. At Fastlane, Goldberg would defeat Owens for the Universal Championship. This led to a match against Lesnar at WrestleMania where Goldberg put his title on the line. At WrestleMania, Goldberg lost the title to Lesnar in what was also his first clean singles loss in his entire career. Goldberg appeared the following night on &quot;Raw Talk&quot; (which aired on the WWE Network after the &quot;Raw&quot; broadcast) to wish the fans farewell, but ultimately did not rule out a return in the future.
On January 15, 2018, ESPN announced that Goldberg would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. This was then confirmed on &quot;Raw&quot; when it was announced by WWE. On March 25, Paul Heyman was announced to induct Goldberg into the Hall of Fame; the event occurred on April 6. Despite his Hall of Fame induction, Goldberg continued to wrestle for WWE. His next match was against The Undertaker at the Super ShowDown event on June 7, 2019. During the match, Goldberg suffered a concussion a few minutes into the match, which severely affected his performance, botching several moves, including the failed Jackhammer on The Undertaker, until The Undertaker finally won the match. His next match was at SummerSlam, where he defeated Dolph Ziggler.

After six months of inactivity, Goldberg returned to WWE on the February 7, 2020 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, when he appeared via satellite and challenged &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt to a match for the Universal Championship, which Wyatt accepted, setting up a match between the two for Super ShowDown. At Super ShowDown on February 27, Goldberg defeated The Fiend to win the Universal Championship for the second time, becoming the first wrestler to win a world championship after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. During the following weeks, WWE scheduled a match between Goldberg and Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 36 for the Universal Championship, but after Reigns opted to pull out amid concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, Goldberg&#x27;s opponent was changed to Braun Strowman. At WrestleMania, Goldberg lost the Universal Championship to Strowman.

==== Various feuds and final matches (2021–present) ====
After a nine-month hiatus, Goldberg faced Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 31, 2021, but was unsuccessful in winning the championship. Goldberg returned on the July 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, its first episode in front of a live audience in over a year, to confront WWE Champion Bobby Lashley, teasing a potential match between the two. On the August 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lashley would accept Goldberg&#x27;s challenge, making their match at SummerSlam for the WWE Championship, official. At SummerSlam, Goldberg lost due to not being able to continue after incurring a knee injury. When Lashley continued to attack him after the end of the match, Goldberg&#x27;s son Gage intervened but ended up being attacked himself.

On the August 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, an interview with Goldberg was shown, during which he revealed needing surgery to his knee and vowed to return to get revenge on Lashley for attacking his son Gage. On the September 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he appeared via satellite to again call out Lashley for having attacked his son, vowing that he would come after Lashley in retaliation. On the October 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg would call out Lashley and in response, Lashley would challenge Goldberg to a no holds barred match at Crown Jewel. At Crown Jewel, Goldberg defeated Lashley to end their feud.

On the February 4, 2022, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Goldberg would make his return to challenge Universal Champion Roman Reigns to a match at Elimination Chamber, a match that had originally been planned for WrestleMania 36 two years prior. At Elimination Chamber, Goldberg lost to Reigns via technical submission.

On October 5, 2024, at Bad Blood, Goldberg and Gage were in the audience. When Gunther came out and insulted him and Gage, Goldberg tried to attack him, but was held back by security guards.

During the podcast at SEC Network, Goldberg announced that he will be returning to WWE for his retirement match at some point in 2025.

==Legacy, parodies, and reception==
&quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin described Goldberg as one of the strongest wrestlers in history. Notably, Mark Henrywho himself is regarded as one of the world&#x27;s strongest menalso described Goldberg as one of the strongest people in wrestling. WWE describes Goldberg as &quot;one of the most dominant Superstars to ever set foot inside the squared circle&quot;. WWE Hall of Famer and industry veteran Arn Anderson likened Goldberg&#x27;s popularity at his late 1990s peak to that of Hulk Hogan, The Rock, and Austin, saying that he &quot;was as hot as anybody has ever been in the history of this business&quot;. Diamond Dallas Page and Bobby Lashley also claimed that Goldberg was the most popular wrestler at one point in time. Kevin Owens has said that Goldberg was the &quot;figurehead&quot; and &quot;poster boy&quot; of WCW, while &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted that he &quot;reached the highest point of popularity in pro wrestling&quot;. He has been named as the favorite wrestler of figures such as Big E, Randy Orton, Madcap Moss, and Bron Breakker.

Due to his extremely masculine wrestling character, Goldberg has been credited with battling Jewish stereotypes, especially the &quot;nice Jewish boy&quot; stereotype which sees Jewish men portrayed as weak and effeminate. In 1999, &quot;Jewish News of Northern California&quot; stated that he had &quot;turned the notion of Jew as victim on its head&quot;. He told the publication, &quot;I wanted to give the Jewish public someone to hold onto, someone as a positive role model that didn&#x27;t go out and cuss, didn&#x27;t go out and cheat, someone to look up to.&quot; In a 2005 interview with the &quot;San Diego Jewish Journal&quot;, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s been a blessing to be a role model for those Jewish kids who never had a Jewish sports hero to look up to, especially those who were too young to remember Koufax or aren&#x27;t into baseball and don&#x27;t follow the career of Shawn Green. [...] [Being Jewish] doesn&#x27;t mean I have to read the Torah every day, but hell, I wrestled in front of millions of people and called myself by my real name. That&#x27;s a testament to myself that I&#x27;m proud of.&quot;

Goldberg&#x27;s rapid rise to popularity in WCW led the WWF to parody him during the Attitude Era with longtime jobber Duane Gill being repackaged as Gillberg. Goldberg was initially unhappy with the parody, but later embraced the character and was happy that Gill was able to have a more substantial run during his career. The two would eventually confront each other on &quot;Raw&quot; in 2003, in which Goldberg quickly dispatched Gillberg.

Trying to replicate WCW&#x27;s success with Goldberg, WWE began pushing Ryback in 2012 in a similar manner to Goldberg, leading to the portmanteau of &quot;Ryberg&quot; to be devised by fans and commentators for Ryback. In October 2012, after Ryback used Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Jackhammer&quot; move during a match against Kofi Kingston, Goldberg tweeted, &quot;NOW comparisons offend me.&quot; Spectators at WWE events had been chanting &quot;Goldberg&quot; during Ryback&#x27;s matches from 2012, which Ryback said &quot;never bothered [him] because fans were very loyal to Goldberg as Goldberg was the top star at WCW and also had a good run in WWE&quot;. In response to Chael Sonnen&#x27;s confusion about Ryback&#x27;s appeal in late 2014, former WWE writer Jon Piermarini noted on an episode of Sonnen&#x27;s podcast that the creative staff were doing &quot;essentially the exact same thing they did with the character when it did not work or catch on the first time&quot; and would only continue to get Goldberg&#x27;s character over as Ryback. Goldberg would return to WWE around the same time Ryback asked for and was granted his release from the company in 2016.

Many promotions would parody Goldberg&#x27;s infamous streak, including WWE on multiple occasions, albeit with a &quot;losing&quot; streak such as with the aforementioned Gillberg as well as Curt Hawkins. In 2014, Ring of Honor started a gimmick for R. D. Evans, where he began gloating about his win streak, which he dubbed the &quot;New Streak&quot;, although all of his wins came over jobbers or by disqualification over serious wrestlers like Michael Elgin and Roderick Strong. His streak eventually ended later that year.

Bret Hart, has been highly critical of Goldberg&#x27;s work and said, &quot;His wrestling, his work rate, was 0 out of 10.&quot; Goldberg&#x27;s later career run has also been criticized; former WCW executive Eric Bischoff stated it is due to his lack of in-ring talent, although Bischoff further said that he viewed only Goldberg and The Rock as legitimate box office draws in 2020. WWE wrestler Riddle has been critical of Goldberg&#x27;s Universal Championship run and accused him of steroid use. However, he later said that he &quot;would love to work with Goldberg,&quot; and that he thought it would be &quot;great for business.&quot; In response to fans complaining about Goldberg being put over younger talent, Goldberg responded, &quot;They can complain all they want. I was brought in for a reason. I&#x27;m a relief pitcher.&quot; He reiterated that he is just a performer and does not book the matches.

=== Mixed martial arts color commentary ===

In August 2002, during his professional wrestling tenure in Japan, Goldberg served as color commentator in mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion Pride Fighting Championship. He also participated in MMA training sessions, though without intention to compete himself. Around this time, Goldberg was challenged by Bob Sapp to either a professional wrestling match or a mixed martial arts fight, but nothing came from it. On July 22, 2006, Goldberg served again as color commentator, this time in World Fighting Alliance (WFA) &quot;King of the Streets&quot;″s pay-per-view in Los Angeles, California. When asked whether he was interested in becoming a mixed martial artist, Goldberg stated, &quot;I&#x27;d love to, especially if I was 21 or even 29, but these guys are so far ahead of me in terms of experience. I never say never, though. But I don&#x27;t see myself stopping my movies, my shows, my commentating, or being a dad to do that&quot;. On June 2, 2007, Goldberg also commentated on K-1 Dynamite USA.

Goldberg became a color commentator for the EliteXC organization during their inaugural event. The event, , was broadcast live on Showtime, on February 10, 2007.

=== Other ===
Goldberg sponsored the Monster Jam truck &quot;Goldberg&quot;, which was driven by Tom Meents from 2000 to 2001 as part of a deal between WCW and FELD Motorsports. The truck was very successful winning the Monster Jam World Finals Racing championship in both 2000 and 2001 and the Freestyle championship in 2001. The partnership ended after WCW was bought by WWE and the truck was renamed to &quot;Team Meents&quot; which later became &quot;Maximum Destruction&quot;.

In November 2000, Goldberg and his brother Steve co-authored Goldberg&#x27;s autobiography &quot;I&#x27;m Next: The Strange Journey of America&#x27;s Most Unlikely Superhero&quot;.

In 2014, Goldberg started his own podcast entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s Next?! With Bill Goldberg&quot;, which includes weekly guest interviews.

Since 2022, Goldberg has appeared multiple times on the &quot;UnsubscribePodcast&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Goldberg has been noted for being open about his Jewish background, which was uncommon in the professional wrestling world, especially during his prime. He famously refused to wrestle on Yom Kippur. He celebrates the Jewish holidays but has downplayed the religious aspects of his Jewish background, admitting in 2005 that he is &quot;so far from religious it&#x27;s not even funny&quot;. Despite this, he added, &quot;I guarantee when my girlfriend and I get married, I&#x27;ll have a rabbi marry us and I&#x27;ll be breaking the glass right next to her.&quot;

On April 10, 2005, Goldberg married Wanda Ferraton, a stunt double he had met while filming &quot;Santa&#x27;s Slay&quot;. From 2001 to 2019, they lived in Bonsall, California, before moving to Boerne, Texas. Their son, Gage, was born in 2006.

Goldberg co-owns the Extreme Power Gym Muay Thai and amateur boxing training facility in Oceanside, California. He also owns over 25 vintage cars, including a Plymouth Barracuda, AC Cobra, and Boss 429 Mustang.

Goldberg owned one of the biggest MMA gyms in the world during the early 90s where he trained MMA with the likes of Mark Coleman, Randy Couture, Kevin Randleman, and Don Frye, among others, but after realizing how much money they made in MMA, he chose to follow a pro-wrestling career. He still actively practices Muay Thai and holds the rank of black belt in jiu-jitsu.

Goldberg has a long scar on the right side of his torso from a tear suffered during a college football game that had required surgery to repair. He also acquired a scar on his right forearm from an altercation in WCW, which kept him out of action for an extended amount of time due to the surgery needed to fix it. He has a large tribal tattoo on his left shoulder, which became his professional wrestling logo, and a skull tattoo on the inside of his right biceps.

=== Charity work ===
In January 2016, Goldberg and entertainment impresario Uncle Louie started a joint venture with disabled Air Force veteran Reinaldo Horday called Combat Crate, which offers a crate of exclusive memorabilia with 100% of the profits from its inaugural crate going to the Wounded Warriors&#x27; South Florida branch.

A long-time animal welfare advocate and an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) spokesman, Goldberg addressed Congress in 1999 to raise awareness of illegal animal fighting.

Goldberg regularly participated in the now-defunct Jimmy V Golf Classic, a golf tournament with the profits going towards cancer research, and often visits children in hospitals who are undergoing cancer treatment.

<doc id="435997" wikidata="Q601820" url="?curid=435997" title="Julia Morgan">
<text>Julia Morgan (January 20, 1872 – February 2, 1957) was an American architect and engineer. She designed more than 700 buildings in California during a long and prolific career. She is best known for her work on Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California.

Morgan was the first woman to be admitted to the architecture program at l&#x27;École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the first woman architect licensed in California. She designed many edifices for institutions serving women and girls, including a number of buildings for the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA) and Mills College.

In many of her structures, Morgan pioneered the aesthetic use of reinforced concrete, a material that proved to have superior seismic performance in the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes. She embraced the Arts and Crafts Movement and used various producers of California pottery to adorn her buildings. She sought to reconcile classical and Craftsman, scholarship and innovation, formalism and whimsy.

Julia Morgan was the first woman to receive the American Institute of Architects highest award, the AIA Gold Medal, posthumously in 2014.

==Early life and education==

=== Childhood ===
Morgan, the daughter of Charles Bill Morgan and Eliza Woodland Parmelee Morgan, was born on January 20, 1872, the second of five children. Her mother, Eliza, grew up as the indulged daughter of Albert O. Parmelee, a cotton trader and millionaire who financially supported the couple when they moved to San Francisco. Two years after their daughter&#x27;s birth, the Morgans moved to a home they had built in the suburb of Oakland. Though the Morgans resided on the West Coast, Eliza still kept close ties with her family. Upon the birth of each Morgan child, the Parmelees sent funds for the family to travel by the transcontinental railroad so that the infant could be christened in the traditional Parmelee family church in New York.
Charles Morgan, a mining engineer from New England who had married into a wealthy family, did not succeed in any of his business ventures, so the family relied heavily on the Parmelee fortune. In 1865, Charles had his first venture in California when he bought land in Santa Paula to unsuccessfully drill for oil. He later cofounded the Shasta Iron Company, which was dissolved in 1875 after limited income. In mid-1878, Eliza took the children to New York to live near the Parmelees for a year while Charles worked in San Francisco. In New York, Julia met her older cousin Lucy Thornton, who was married to successful architect Pierre LeBrun. After returning to Oakland, Julia kept in contact with Le Brun; he encouraged her to pursue a higher education. In New York, Julia had been sick with scarlet fever and was kept in bed for a few weeks. As a result of this illness, she was prone to ear infections throughout her adult life. Upon the death of Albert Parmelee in July 1880, Julia&#x27;s grandmother moved into the Morgan&#x27;s&#x27; Oakland house, bringing with her the Parmelee wealth. Both Julia&#x27;s mother and grandmother provided strong female role models, who because of their wealth had a strong degree of power in the Morgan household.

=== Education ===
Morgan graduated from Oakland High School in 1890. She was dedicated to her education and a professional career in architecture. She enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied Engineering, as there was no architectural program. At the university, she was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and was often the only woman in her math, science, and engineering courses. She attended Berkeley during a time of growth for women&#x27;s involvement which took place between 1889 and 1891, when women were founding clubs and gaining access to new spaces and extracurriculars. Morgan helped to create a chapter of the YWCA during her time as an undergraduate student which made it possible for women to use the gymnasium. She graduated in 1894 as the first woman with a B.S. degree in civil engineering at Berkeley with honors. After her graduation, Morgan became a member of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, now the American Association of University Women.
One of the engineering lecturers of her senior year was Bernard Maybeck, an architect who designed buildings that Morgan admired for their respect for the surrounding topography and environment. Maybeck mentored Morgan, along with her classmates Arthur Brown, Jr., Edward H. Bennett and Lewis P. Hobart, in architecture at his Berkeley home. He encouraged Morgan to continue her studies at the prestigious École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he had distinguished himself. After graduating Berkeley in 1894, Morgan gained a year of work experience building with Maybeck, then traveled to Paris in 1896 to prepare for the Beaux-Arts entrance exam. The school had never before allowed a woman to study architecture, but in 1897 it opened its entry process to women applicants, largely because of pressure from a union of French women artists, whom Morgan characterized as &quot;bohemians.&quot; In her time at the Beaux-Arts, Morgan interacted with members of the Union des femmes peintres et sculpteurs, a group focused on advancing women in art. Morgan met with these women and was exposed to their feminist views; they discussed how to increase the influence of women in professional careers.

In principle, the school admitted the top 30 candidates. It took Morgan three tries to get in: on the first try, she placed too low, while on her second try, in 1898, although she placed well into the top 30, the examiners &quot;arbitrarily lowered&quot; her marks. After more than a year of further study, tutored by François-Benjamin Chaussemiche, a winner of the Prix de Rome, she finally passed the entrance exams in the Architecture Program, placing 13th out of 376 applicants, and was duly admitted. However, she could study only until her 30th birthday, as the school prohibited older scholars. In early 1902, as her birthday approached, Morgan submitted an outstanding design for a palatial theater. This earned her a certificate in architecture, making her the first woman to receive one from the school; she did so in three years, although the usual time of completion was five years (that was how long Maybeck took, for example). She stayed in Paris long enough to collaborate with Chaussemiche on a project for Harriet Fearing, an ex–New Yorker who contracted for a &quot;grand salon&quot; design for her residence in Fontainebleau.

==Career==
Upon her return from Paris, Morgan began working for San Francisco architect John Galen Howard, who was supervising the University of California Master Plan. Morgan worked on several buildings on the Berkeley campus, providing the decorative elements for the Hearst Mining Building and an early proposal for Sather Gate. She was the primary designer for the Hearst Greek Theatre, UC Berkeley&#x27;s amphitheater that overlooks the San Francisco Bay. Howard told a colleague that Morgan was &quot;an excellent draftsman whom I have to pay almost nothing, as it is a woman.&quot; She saved her money and made plans to work on her own, accepting important side projects.

In 1904, Morgan was the first woman to obtain an architecture license in California. While living at the old family home in Oakland, she opened her own office in San Francisco, where the staff knew her as &#x27;J.M.&#x27; After her first office was destroyed by the 1906 fire, she opened her office in 1907 on the 13th floor of the Merchants Exchange Building, 465 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco&#x27;s financial district, where she worked for the rest of her career. In 1907 she partnered with Ira Hoover, former draftsman of Howard. As a firm named Morgan and Hoover, the two worked together until 1910. Morgan reestablished an individual private practice in late 1910.

In April 1904, Julia Morgan completed her first reinforced concrete structure, El Campanil, the 72-foot bell tower at Mills College, which is located across the bay from San Francisco. Two years later, El Campanil survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake unscathed, which helped build her reputation and launch her career. Throughout her career, Julia Morgan was said to have completed approximately 800 buildings, most of which are located in California. 

The devastation of the San Francisco earthquake in 1906 provided her with the opportunity to design numerous homes, churches, offices, and educational facilities.
An important project was the redesign of the landmark Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco after its interior was severely damaged by fire after the earthquake of 1906. She was chosen because of her then-rare knowledge of earthquake-resistant, reinforced concrete construction. Her work on restoring the Fairmont in less than a year brought her a national reputation as &quot;a superb engineer, an innovative designer and architect, and a dedicated professional.&quot; The marked increase in commissions following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake brought her financial success.

Greatly impressed by her work on the Fairmont, Phoebe Hearst recommended Morgan for several large construction projects, including Asilomar. Her son, William Randolph Hearst, was likewise greatly impressed and, after his mother&#x27;s death, retained Morgan to design what would become the biggest and most famous project of her career, Hearst Castle.

===Hearst projects===
Julia Morgan’s involvement with the Hearst family continued for three generations. Her first project was commissioned by the family in 1902, when she returned from the École: Phoebe Apperson Hearst&#x27;s Hacienda at Pleasanton. Morgan&#x27;s most famous patron was the newspaper magnate and antiquities collector William Randolph Hearst, who had been introduced to Morgan by his mother Phoebe Apperson Hearst, the chief patron of the University of California at Berkeley. It is believed that this introduction led to Morgan&#x27;s first downstate commission by Hearst for the design of the Los Angeles Examiner Building (circa 1914), a Mission revival style project that included contributions by Los Angeles architects William J. Dodd and J. Martyn Haenkel. It is located at the southwest corner of Broadway and 11th Streets on a city block in Downtown Los Angeles. After the Examiner closed in 1989, the building was eventually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, over the objections of the Hearst Corporation, which was exploring demolition. A 2016 rehabilitation project resulted in the building becoming a site for multiple commercial tenants, notably Arizona State University in 2021.

In 1919, Hearst selected Morgan as the architect for La Cuesta Encantada, better known as Hearst Castle, which was built atop the family campsite overlooking San Simeon Harbor. Morgan employed tiles, designing many of them herself, from California Faience.

The project proved to be her largest and most complex, as Hearst&#x27;s vision for his estate grew ever grander over the decades of planning and construction. The project included The Hacienda, a residence–private guest house complex built in hybrid Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival (working with Hispanic experts Mildred Stapley and Arthur Byne), and Moorish Revival styles. It was located a day&#x27;s horseback ride inland from Hearst Castle, next to the Mission San Antonio de Padua near Jolon, California. Her work on &#x27;the Castle&#x27; and San Simeon Ranch continued until 1947, ended only by Hearst&#x27;s declining health.

Morgan became William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s principal architect, producing the designs for dozens of buildings, such as Phoebe Apperson Hearst&#x27;s Wyntoon, which he inherited. The estate includes a castle and &quot;Bavarian village&quot; of four villas, all on of forest reserve that includes the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in Northern California. She also did studio and site work for the uncompleted &quot;Babicora&quot;, Hearst&#x27;s Chihuahua, Mexico, cattle rancho and retreat.

===YWCA projects===
Julia Morgan&#x27;s affiliation with the YWCA began when Phoebe Apperson Hearst recommended her for the organization&#x27;s Asilomar summer conference center, a project she began in 1913. The Asilomar Conference Center, no longer YWCA but state-run, is still in Pacific Grove near Monterey, California. Morgan also designed YWCAs in California, Utah, Arizona, and Hawaii.

Five of the Southern California YWCA buildings were designed by Morgan. The 1918 Harbor Area YWCA (San Pedro, CA) in a Craftsman building is still standing, as is the 1926 Hollywood Studio Club YWCA. Morgan&#x27;s Riverside YWCA from 1929 still stands, but as the Riverside Art Museum. Her 1925 Long Beach Italian Renaissance branch has been demolished. The &quot;gorgeous&quot; Pasadena YWCA was acquired by the City in 2010 for restoration and public use after several decades of decay.

Morgan also designed YWCA buildings in Northern California, including those in Oakland and in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. The YWCA building in San Francisco reflects her understanding of traditional Chinese architecture. The building was restored in 2001 by the Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA), and now houses the Chinese Historical Society of America Museum and Learning Center.

===Mills College===
Morgan made many architectural contributions to Mills College, a women&#x27;s college in the East Bay foothills of Oakland, California. Like her work for the YWCA, they were done in the hopes of advancing opportunities for women.

Mills president Susan Mills became interested in Morgan in 1904 because she wished to further the career of a female architect and because Morgan, who was early in her career, charged less than her male counterparts. Morgan designed six buildings for the Mills campus, including El Campanil, believed to be the first bell tower on a United States college campus. (El Campanil should not be confused with &quot;The Campanile&quot;, a nickname for Sather Tower, the bell tower of nearby UC Berkeley.) Morgan helped draft parts of the UC Berkeley campus under John Galen Howard, but the Sather Tower was not her design. Despite being chosen by Mills to design El Campanil and her academic credentials, coworkers like Bernard Ransome, son of Ernest Ransome, did not trust in her abilities as a true concrete expert. Ransome&#x27;s undermining of Morgan&#x27;s ability led to less trust in her work and praise veiled in gendered rhetoric at the time. For example, a speaker at the dedication ceremony praised El Campanil for being &quot;reared by the genius of a woman&#x27;s brain.&quot;

Morgan&#x27;s reputation grew when the tower was unscathed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The bells in the tower &quot;were cast for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (Chicago-1893), and given to Mills by a trustee&quot;. This success led to Morgan becoming the unofficial principal architect for Mills College for the next two decades.

Morgan also designed the Margaret Carnegie Library (1906), named after Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s daughter, and the Ming Quong Home for Chinese girls, built in 1924 and purchased for Mills in 1936. It was eventually renamed Alderwood Hall, before becoming the Julia Morgan School for Girls in 2004 (independent of the College). Morgan designed the Mills College Student Union in 1916. Morgan&#x27;s Kapiolani Cottage has served as an infirmary, faculty housing, and administration offices. Morgan also designed the original gymnasium and pool, since replaced by the Tea Shop and Suzanne Adams Plaza, the first reinforced concrete structure on the west coast.

=== Heritage on the Marina ===

From 1922 to 1925, Julia Morgan was enlisted to design a nursing home to house elderly women in San Francisco. Today the building is home to Heritage on the Marina, San Francisco’s premier Life Plan Community. The beautiful Julia Morgan building is owned and operated by the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, one of California’s first philanthropic organizations, established in 1853.

===Other projects===
Among her earliest works was the North Star House in Grass Valley, California, commissioned in 1904–05 by mining engineer Arthur De Wint Foote and his wife, the author and illustrator Mary Hallock Foote.

She considered St. John&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, in Berkeley, California, her finest Craftsman-style building. It is now the Berkeley Playhouse.

Other projects include the Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland; the nearby brick multi-use building at 4021 Piedmont Avenue; the sanctuary of Ocean Avenue Presbyterian Church at 32 Ocean Avenue, San Francisco (where Mission Bay Community Church also meets); and the large Berkeley City Club adjacent to University of California. She designed the World War I YWCA Hostess House in Palo Alto, built in 1918 and later to become the site of the MacArthur Park Restaurant

Some of her residential projects, most of them located in the San Francisco Bay Area, are ultimate bungalows. The style is often associated with the work of Greene and Greene and some of Morgan&#x27;s other contemporaries and teachers. The buildings represent the Arts and Crafts Movement and the American Craftsman style of architecture. Several houses are on San Francisco&#x27;s Russian Hill. She lived further west in SF. One of Morgan’s first residential project was to remodel and complete Phoebe Hearst’s Hacienda del Pozo de Verona in Pleasanton, California, in Mediterranean and California Mission style. In 1908, Morgan designed the residence of James Henry Pierce at 1650 The Alameda in San Jose, which features rare California timber. 

Morgan designed two houses in Monterey County, California. One, designed by Morgan in 1915, is the &quot;Little Cottage of River Winds&quot; at 26184 Carmelo Street at Carmel Point, outside the Carmel-by-the-Sea city limits. The other is the &quot;Dr. Emma W. Pope House&quot; at 2981 Franciscan Way, on a hillside overlooking the Carmel Mission. It was built in 1940, in the Minimal Traditional architectural style for Dr. Emma Whitman Pope, who was a friend from Morgan&#x27;s undergraduate years at the UC Berkeley. 

==Personal life==

Although Morgan was highly respected as an architect, not much is known about her personal life. She was never married and had no known romantic relationships. She kept a low profile and lived modestly, in spite of her wealthy clientele. Colleagues and acquaintances were surprised by her modest sense of fashion, a coworker even went as far as saying that Morgan dressed like a &quot;nobody.&quot; Morgan gave few interviews and did not write about herself. Early interviews used gendered rhetoric to speak about her accomplishments and early newspaper articles followed her progress at the École des Beaux Arts. After that she mostly avoided interviews and only agreed to articles that focused on her work to advance her reputation. She worked tirelessly on minimal sleep and food.

Morgan was very independent. During her transition to Paris she had a fund given to her by her parents for all of her first-year expenses. Even when her funds ran out, she never asked her family for any extra money, but instead learned to live on a tight budget. This experience gave her a concrete understanding of how to handle money efficiently, which helped make her a successful businesswoman after she opened her own practice, and helped her to focus on keeping her projects within her clients&#x27; budgets.

One of the few public awards she accepted was the University of California, Berkeley, honorary Doctor of Laws degree, its highest award, conferred upon her on May 15, 1929, with the following personal tribute: &quot;distinguished alumna of the University of California, artist and engineer; designer of simple dwellings and of stately homes, of great buildings nobly planned to further the centralized activities of her fellow citizens; architect in whose works harmony and admirable proportions bring pleasure to the eye and peace to the mind.&quot;

Intrigued with the gaps in Julia Morgan&#x27;s life story, Belinda Taylor, wrote &quot;Becoming Julia Morgan&quot;, a 2012 play in which Taylor imagines a plausible life story for Morgan.

==Death and legacy==
Julia Morgan died on February 2, 1957, in San Francisco, California, at age 85. Her body was buried in the Mountain View Cemetery in the hills of Oakland, California.

In 1995, the Julia Morgan Ballroom at the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco, where she had her office from 1907 to 1950, was named in her honor.

In 1999, a Mediterranean Revival residence originally built in 1918 for Charles Goethe of Sacramento was renamed the Julia Morgan House. It was earlier added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

In 2006, a children&#x27;s picture book titled &quot;Julia Morgan Built a Castle&quot; was published and is available in many public libraries.

On May 28, 2008, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Julia Morgan would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony took place on December 15 and her great-niece accepted the honor in her place.

Julia Morgan was the 2014 recipient (posthumous) of the AIA Gold Medal, the highest award of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). She was the first female architect to receive this honor.

<text>Mills College at Northeastern University in Oakland, California is part of Northeastern University&#x27;s global university system. Mills College was founded as the Young Ladies Seminary in 1852 in Benicia, California; it was relocated to Oakland in 1871 and became the second women&#x27;s college west of the Rockies. In 2022, it merged with Northeastern University.

==History==

Mills College was initially founded as the Young Ladies Seminary in the city of Benicia in 1852 under the leadership of Mary Atkins, a graduate of Oberlin College. 

In 1865, Susan Tolman Mills, a graduate of Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), and her husband, Cyrus Mills, bought the Young Ladies Seminary renaming it Mills Seminary. In 1871, the school was moved to its current location in Oakland, California. The school was incorporated in 1877 and was officially renamed Mills College in 1885. In 1890, after serving for decades as principal (under two presidents as well), Susan Mills became the president of the college and held the position for 19 years. 

Beginning in 1906 the seminary classes were progressively eliminated. In 1920, Mills added graduate programs for women and men, granting its first master&#x27;s degrees the following year.

Other notable milestones in the college&#x27;s history include the presidency of renowned educator and activist Aurelia Henry Reinhardt during World War I and II, the establishment of the first laboratory school west of the Mississippi for aspiring teachers (currently known as the Mills College Children&#x27;s School) in 1926, and becoming the first women&#x27;s college to offer a computer science major (1974).

===Reversal of decision to go co-ed===
In 1990, Mills became the first and only women&#x27;s college in the US to reverse a decision to go coed. On May 3, 1990, Mills Trustees announced that they had voted to admit male undergraduate students to Mills. 
This decision led to a two-week student and staff strike, accompanied by numerous displays of non-violent protests by the students. 
At one point, nearly 300 students blockaded the administrative offices and boycotted classes. 
On May 18, the Trustees met again to reconsider the decision, leading to a reversal of the vote to go co-ed on the undergraduate level.

===First single-sex college to formally welcome transgender students===
In 2014, Mills became the first single-sex college in the U.S. to adopt an admission policy explicitly welcoming transgender students. 
The policy stated that undergraduate students who were not assigned to the female sex at birth, but who self-identified as women, were welcome to apply for admission. Undergraduates who were assigned to the female sex at birth, but identified as transgender or gender fluid, also were welcome to apply for admission. The policy further clarified that undergraduate students assigned to the female sex at birth who had legally become male prior to applying were not eligible for admission to Mills. The policy ended with a statement that &quot;once admitted, any student who completes the College&#x27;s graduate requirements shall be awarded a degree,&quot; indicating that once admitted to Mills, an undergraduate female student who changed gender to male would be allowed to complete their degree at the college.

===Financial difficulties and re-visioning===
In 2017, Mills declared a financial emergency, citing declining student enrollment and revenues, and laid off some tenured faculty. 
That September, it became the first private college in California to implement a tuition reset, announcing a 36% reduction in its undergraduate tuition beginning in fall 2018, with a goal of making a Mills education more affordable. Undergraduate tuition in the 2018–2019 academic year was $28,765 (reduced from $44,765); room and board costs were $13,448. Students are still able to receive merit scholarships and need-based financial aid in addition to the tuition reduction.

In March 2021, one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, Mills announced plans to no longer be an independent, degree-granting college but rather a research institute known as the Mills Institute. 
Following this announcement, multiple higher education institutions reached out to Mills to explore merger options.

===Merger with Northeastern University===
In June 2021, the college announced a plan to merge with Boston-based Northeastern University and become a co-ed regional campus as part of Northeastern&#x27;s global university system. 
Multiple lawsuits opposing the merger were filed by parties including two Mills College trustees and a substantial number of current Mills students.

The merger between Mills and Northeastern was finalized in June 2022, and the school was renamed Mills College at Northeastern University.

==Academics==
Its most popular majors, based on 2020–21 graduates, were:

* Psychology (16)
* English Language &amp; Literature (13)
* Sociology (13)Health Policy Analysis (12)
* Biology/Biological Sciences (11)
* Child Development (10)
* Fine/Studio Arts (10)

===Admissions===

For much of its time as an independent institution, admission to Mills was selective. As the college began encountering financial difficulties, admission became less selective, with acceptance rates hovering around the 75% mark. In preparation for the Northeastern merger, Mills stopped accepting admission applications in 2021. Post-merger, Mills College at Northeastern has announced that it plans to accept new applicants for fall 2023 enrollment.

====Julia Morgan Buildings====

In 1904, Mills president Susan Mills became interested in architect Julia Morgan because she wished to further the career of a female architect, and because Morgan, just beginning her career, charged less than her male counterparts. Morgan designed six buildings for the Mills campus, including El Campanil, believed to be the first freestanding bell tower on a United States college campus. El Campanil consists of 72 feet of reinforced concrete in a Spanish Mission-style and resides in front of Seminary Hall. The bell tower has a low pitched red tile roof and seven arched openings for the ten bells. The nails and lock of the large wooden door to El Campanil come from an old Spanish church in Mexico. Morgan&#x27;s reputation grew when the tower was unscathed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The bells in the tower &quot;were cast for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (Chicago-1893), and given to Mills by a trustee&quot;. The ten bells were named after the graces of the spirit to emphasize the school&#x27;s commitment to the Christian mission; Faith, Hope, Peace, Joy, Love, Meekness, Gentleness, Self Control, Longing, Suffering. Surrounding the structure are southern California flora adorn earthenware jars that Morgan designed in the style of those at the Alhambra.

<doc id="436014" wikidata="Q1030989" url="?curid=436014" title="McCloud (TV series)">
<text>McCloud is an American police drama television series created by Herman Miller, that aired on NBC from September 16, 1970, to April 17, 1977. The series starred Dennis Weaver, and for six of its seven years as part of the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; rotating wheel series that was produced for the network by Universal Television. The show was centered on Deputy Marshal Sam McCloud of the small western town of Taos, New Mexico, who was on loan to the metropolitan New York City Police Department (NYPD) as a special investigator.

==History==

The first choice for the role of McCloud was Fess Parker, who turned it down. Universal hired Dennis Weaver, who was well known as a &quot;western&quot; actor from &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. The pilot, &quot;Portrait of a Dead Girl&quot;, aired on February 17, 1970, and established the premise by having McCloud escort a prisoner from New Mexico to New York City, only to become embroiled in solving a complicated murder case.

This premise of &quot;a cowboy in the big city&quot; was adapted from the 1968 Don Siegel film &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, starring Clint Eastwood. Herman Miller, who was responsible for the story of &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; and co-wrote the screenplay with Dean Riesner and Howard Rodman, is credited as the creator of &quot;McCloud&quot;. &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; reflects Richard Thorpe&#x27;s 1942 film &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s New York Adventure&quot; and the latter-day career of Bat Masterson. (Siegel appeared in the &quot;Return to the Alamo&quot; episode as &quot;2nd Desk Sergeant&quot;). Like Coogan, McCloud galloped the length and breadth of Manhattan (he was joined by a mounted unit in &quot;The 42nd Street Cavalry&quot;), and the sight of McCloud on horseback riding down the middle of a busy traffic choked city street flanked by tall skyscrapers (taken from an early episode) became one of the series&#x27; most famous images.

NBC picked up the show for six 60-minute episodes in September and October 1970, placing it in the rotation of its original wheel series &quot;Four in One&quot; along with &quot;San Francisco International Airport&quot;, &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot; and &quot;Rod Serling&#x27;s Night Gallery&quot;. The following fall, the network commissioned a new wheel series and lengthened &quot;McCloud&quot; from sixty to ninety minutes. NBC ordered two new series, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;, to fill the wheel and all three became part of the newly named &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; series, which aired on Wednesday nights. The series, with a distinctive opening musical theme composed by Henry Mancini over a video collage of the various series became a hit, finishing at number 14 in the Nielsen ratings for that 1971–1972 season. NBC then decided to try another competitive move and relocated &quot;McCloud&quot;, along with &quot;McMillan&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;, to Sunday nights for the following Fall 1972. The &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series was an even bigger draw on Sundays, finishing at number 5 in the ratings for the season.

Starting in the fifth season in September 1974, most episodes were two hours long, but were dropped again to 90 minutes for the seventh and final season starting in the October 1976. Episodes 5 and 9 of season 5 were 90 minutes. The 46th, and last, episode, &quot;McCloud Meets Dracula&quot;, was aired on April 17, 1977.

Weaver received Emmy nominations in 1974 and 1975 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series.

The executive producer was Glen A. Larson, who also wrote for the series, as did Peter Allan Fields, Lou Shaw, Jimmy Sangster, and others. Larson won an Edgar Award for &quot;The New Mexican Connection&quot;.

==Recurring themes and characters==
===The westerner in New York City===
The most enduring theme of the show was the conflict between the good-natured, clear-eyed buoyancy of McCloud and the metropolitan cynicism of the residents of New York City, including his fellow officers. McCloud&#x27;s attire, typically consisting of a sheepskin coat or Western jacket, bolo tie and cowboy hat and boots, allowed for implied comic relief in many encounters with New Yorkers. That New Yorkers might mistake him for a &quot;rube&quot; because of his appearance occasionally worked to his advantage. He would often allay suspicion of his motives by insisting he was in New York &quot;to observe and learn&quot;. Under his jacket or coat, he usually wore a khaki uniform shirt with a brown star-shaped uniform patch with gold trim on left sleeve, lettered &quot;Marshal&#x27;s Office Taos, N.M.&quot;. There was a yellow circle in the center with the number 33. He wore two collar pins one was &quot;NM&quot; and the other was &quot;33&quot;. McCloud carried a blued .45 Colt SAA Western-style six-shooter with a 4¾&quot; barrel.

The signature of McCloud&#x27;s character was his Western unflappability and seeming inability to recognize an insult, especially from his NYPD superior, Chief of Detectives Peter B. Clifford, whose jibes (&quot;send in the sagebrush Sherlock Holmes&quot;) he never would take personally. Weaver&#x27;s grin and drawling twang represented McCloud as the embodiment of the American law officer who always sees the good in people but knows the real stakes and spares no pain to catch the bad guy. The character&#x27;s signature catchphrase was &quot;There ya go!&quot;, often received with bemusement or puzzlement by the listener. (One exception was a character played by John Denver; at the end of the show they traded catchphrases, Denver responding &quot;There ya go!&quot; to McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Far out!&quot;)

===Antagonism with Chief Clifford===
Another recurring theme in the show was the conflict between McCloud and Chief Clifford, who was played in every episode but the pilot by J. D. Cannon. In the first episodes, their relationship was portrayed as somewhat amiable, with Clifford showing a wary respect for the unconventional Westerner assigned to his command. The relationship quickly soured based mostly on McCloud&#x27;s seeming disregard of authority combined with a charm that let him escape many of the consequences of his &quot;cowboy-like&quot; determination. Clifford&#x27;s attitude to McCloud became one of cynical antagonism, bordering at times on extreme rage, but usually tempered with a grudging respect for McCloud&#x27;s ability to solve the most difficult of cases. McCloud frequently interrupts a dressing-down from Clifford by saying &quot;I &#x27;ppreciate yer confidence, Chief!&quot;

===Friendship with Sgt. Broadhurst===
In many episodes, McCloud was partnered with Sgt. Joe Broadhurst, played by Terry Carter. Broadhurst, a New Yorker, was portrayed with a certain existential pessimism to counter McCloud&#x27;s high spirits. Like Chief Clifford, Broadhurst felt himself wise to McCloud&#x27;s peculiarities, but was without the anger, and usually wound up resigned to being drawn into McCloud&#x27;s schemes to solve particular cases, sometimes against direct orders. He would then sometimes play the role of voluntary lightning rod for Clifford&#x27;s anger, and absorb as much of the blame for McCloud&#x27;s initiative as McCloud himself. (Broadhurst served as acting Chief of Detectives three times during Clifford&#x27;s absence, in &quot;This Must Be the Alamo&quot;, &quot;Return to the Alamo&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Twas the Fight Before Christmas...&quot;.)

===Other characters===
Other recurring characters on the show included the gravel-voiced Sgt. Grover, played by Ken Lynch, who seemed to be forever at his desk in the squad room. The ever-smiling but somewhat batty Sgt. Phyllis Norton was played by Teri Garr.

===Love interests===
McCloud was portrayed as something of a ladies&#x27; man, and the characters played by the frequent female guest stars would often fall for his protective charm. Chris Coughlin, played by frequent guest star Diana Muldaur, was McCloud&#x27;s off-and-on lover throughout the course of the series. Chris was a journalist whose duties as newspaper writer (&quot;never a reporter&quot;) sometimes came into conflict with McCloud&#x27;s police work.

==Portrayal of New York City in the 1970s==

The show, which was in some sense a big city western, was set in New York City during what was arguably NYC&#x27;s lowest point in the late 20th century, a period following the troubled 1960s and leading up to the fiscal crisis of 1975 (which figured, for example, in the episode &quot;The Day New York Turned Blue&quot;). The title card of the early seasons of the show prominently showed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center still under construction, which at the time was a highly controversial urban regeneration project in the city.

At the time, the city seemed to be on an inexorable downward slide into chaos, a theme that was explored in a more brutal fashion in movies such as William Friedkin&#x27;s film &quot;The French Connection&quot;, which was released in 1971, the year after the pilot of &quot;McCloud&quot;, and Michael Winner&#x27;s 1974 urban thriller &quot;Death Wish&quot;. In some episodes (such as &quot;Walk in the Dark&quot;) the city was portrayed as particularly crime-ridden with the danger of muggings and bodily harm at every turn. Such lurking evil was often more in the dialogue than the pictures, however, and the show retained a somewhat whimsical and sunny flavor despite the subject matter.

&quot;McCloud&quot; was filmed partially on location (the unit was in New York for &quot;A Little Plot at Tranquil Valley&quot; notably, and traveled to Hawaii for &quot;A Cowboy in Paradise&quot;, to Mexico City and Teotihuacán for &quot;Lady on the Run&quot;, and to Sydney for &quot;Night of the Shark&quot; — second-unit footage came from London, Paris, Monaco, Rome, and Moscow at various times), but utilized the Universal back lot for many scenes.

A recurring theme in many episodes was the incorporation of a plot device from Hollywood cinema, particularly at the climax of an episode. Examples included chases on horseback to lasso cattle rustlers (&quot;The Colorado Cattle Caper&quot;), a 1930s-style gangster shoot-out (the film-within-a-film shot on location in &quot;The Gang That Stole Manhattan&quot;), a Jesse James-style train hold-up on the Long Island Rail Road (&quot;Butch Cassidy Rides Again&quot;), and a showdown with a vampire on the Third Street Bridge (&quot;McCloud Meets Dracula&quot;).

==&quot;The Return of Sam McCloud&quot;==
Weaver, Cannon and Carter later reprised their roles in a made-for-television movie, &quot;The Return of Sam McCloud&quot;, which premiered on November 12, 1989 on CBS. McCloud, who is now a United States Senator for New Mexico, faces off against a villainous chemical manufacturer after he kills McCloud&#x27;s niece. Diana Muldaur also returned to reprise her role as McCloud&#x27;s love interest, Chris Coughlin.

==Episodes==

==Home media==
Universal Studios released Seasons 1 &amp; 2 of &quot;McCloud&quot; on DVD in Region 1 and Region 2 in 2005/2006. Season 1 as released by Universal were not the original episodes but conflated &quot;TV Movie&quot; re-creations by Universal producer Harry Tatelman and editor Jean-Jacques Berthelot to extract additional revenues from a series considered too short of episodes to produce useful syndicated material. By editing together pieces from multiple episodes in season 1 it made it appear that McCloud solves two mysteries in each &quot;movie&quot;. Subplots and some characters were edited out. This process was made easier by the fact that McCloud&#x27;s uniform remained the same in each episode. The results were disjointed enough that at least one original writer, Douglas Heyes, required his name being changed in the credits to a pseudonym. These hybrid episodes were at one time considered all that was left of the original six programs of season 1 (Universal could not locate them when it issued the U.S. DVD set). The originals, located after a diligent search by the Australian independent label Madman Entertainment, were found in good condition stored in a vault at a station in London.

Visual Entertainment released the Complete series on DVD in Region 1 in January 2022.

In Denmark (region 2) where &quot;McCloud&quot; was a hit when it was new, all 7 seasons have been released on DVD.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment has released all seven seasons on DVD in Australia. Seasons 6 &amp; 7 were released on June 19, 2013. The Season 7 release includes the reunion television film &quot;The Return of Sam McCloud&quot;.

The show is rated PG for Parental Guidance in Australia and PG in New Zealand for violence and drug references.

==In popular culture==
&quot;McCloud&quot; became the basis for a recurring joke on the movie-mocking TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;: whenever one character in the featured movie would call out to someone else, host characters Joel Robinson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot would chime in by calling out to other unrelated fictional characters such as Mr. Drysdale and &quot;Mr. Eddie&#x27;s father&quot;. Invariably, these exchanges ended with Servo calling &quot;Chief?&quot; and Crow responding with &quot;McCloud!&quot; The gag was most prominently featured in episode 303, &quot;Pod People&quot;.

On an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Lastest Gun in the West&quot;, Weaver guest-stars as an old-time cowboy star named Buck McCoy, who in the 1970s had starred on a detective show called &quot;McTrigger&quot;, about which McCoy admits, &quot;Seems all I did was shoot hippies.&quot; A clip showed McTrigger driving through New York in a convertible shooting at random members of the hippie crowd that covered the sidewalks. McCoy mentions the show was retooled after his character was written out to become &quot;Room 222&quot;.

McCloud was also parodied by British comedian Benny Hill in a skit on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; “Murder on The Oregon Express” in March, 1976. In typical Hill fashion, Benny portrayed a host of characters for comic effect from American Crime-dramas of the time such as &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, and &quot;Kojak&quot;.

Weaver played a version of himself in &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, in an episode set on the Universal back lot (where much of &quot;McCloud&quot; was actually shot), in which he rides out of nowhere and saves Pamela Sue Martin&#x27;s Nancy Drew character by drawing her up on his horse when she is in a tight spot. His small bit of dialogue makes clear that he is an actor on a break from a shoot, and his costuming and horse suggest that he is Weaver on a break from &quot;McCloud&quot;, but like several other celebrity guest spots in the episode, it&#x27;s never made explicit that he is playing himself.

==Syndication==
&quot;McCloud&quot; has aired in reruns on local stations in the past, and continues to do so on some to this day.

Me-TV brought &quot;McCloud&quot; to its schedule as part of the late night &quot;MeTV Mystery Movie&quot; programming block which premiered on January 1, 2015. The network was employing a wheel arrangement similar to the original NBC Wednesday and Sunday &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; and rotated several other long-running programs from those including, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Banacek&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot; and the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; telefilms produced by NBC. The network eventually ceased airing the Mystery Movies, which moved to Cozi TV.

<text>Wonder Boy in Monster Land, known by its original arcade release as is a platform video game developed by Westone Bit Entertainment and released by Sega in Japanese arcades in 1987 and for the Master System in 1988, with a number of other home computer and console ports following. The game is the sequel to the 1986 game &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; and takes place eleven years after the events in the previous game. After enjoying over a decade of peace on Wonder Land following the defeat of the evil King by Tom-Tom, later bestowed the title &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;, a fire-breathing dragon called the MEKA dragon appeared; he and his minions conquered Wonder Land, turning it into &quot;Monster Land&quot;. The people, helpless due to their lack of fighting skill, call for Wonder Boy, now a teenager, to destroy the monsters and defeat the MEKA dragon. Players control Wonder Boy through twelve linear levels as he makes his way through Monster Land to find and defeat the MEKA dragon. Players earn gold by defeating enemies and buy weapons, armor, footwear, magic, and other items to help along the way.

The arcade version of &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; amassed moderate sales, the Master System version received overall positive reviews in all aspects and has been highly regarded as one of the better titles in the Master System library. Reviews praised the game for its colorful graphics, smooth controls, gameplay, and replay value. Other ports received mixed reception: criticisms included very slow multi-load times on the home computer versions, sub-quality sound, and smaller play areas. The arcade version would later be re-released in emulated form as a digital download for Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It had a sequel, &quot;Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap&quot;, released for the Master System in 1989.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; follows the events in its predecessor, &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;. The game&#x27;s main protagonist is a young boy named Bock Lee Temjin, known to his friends as &quot;Tom-Tom&quot;. In &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; Tom-Tom&#x27;s girlfriend Tanya was kidnapped by the &quot;evil King&quot; and was taken to his woodland kingdom; Tom-Tom set out to the kingdom, defeated the evil King, and saved Tanya. Word spread throughout Wonder Land about Tom-Tom&#x27;s quest, and people bestowed upon him the title of &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Evil King was resurrected as the MEKA Dragon, who in turn established a powerful army. Additionally, the MEKA Dragon placed mind-controlling bracelets on the land’s various inhabitants and forced them to do his bidding. He also hired the Brothers of Knight (Red and Blue) to do his bidding. Tom-Tom heard of this incident and set off to kill the MEKA Dragon. The game ends with Tom-Tom defeating the dragon, leading up to a cliffhanger for the third game.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot;, players control Wonder Boy as he destroys the monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts out in the City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but to give him a chance, at the beginning of the game, the city&#x27;s mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.

Wonder Boy has a life meter which consists of a series of red hearts; he starts the game with five red hearts. Whenever he sustains damage those hearts turn black. When all the hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies, and the game ends. Players score points whenever Wonder Boy defeats enemies and collects certain treasures, and at certain point intervals Wonder Boy receives an additional life heart. Players earn gold throughout the game in order to purchase weapons, magic weapons, and other items in shops and rooms. Gold is obtained from enemies, while some are hidden in odd places such as trees and clouds. The game has an &quot;Hourglass Timer&quot; on the top of the screen; whenever the Hourglass Timer runs out, Wonder Boy loses some life. The Hourglass Timer can be refilled by collecting hourglasses or by visiting hospitals or taverns. In the ZX Spectrum version of the game, a candle represents the timer.

In the Master System version of the game, pressing the pause button on the console takes players to the Status Screen which primarily shows what items they currently have. Other information displayed in the Status Screen include types and strengths of weapons and armor equipped; gold; life remaining; special items collected; and types of &quot;Magic Weapons&quot; collected and their quantities. Magic Weapons include bombs that roll on the ground, fireballs that fly through the air, small tornadoes that run on the ground and attack enemies, and &quot;thunder flash&quot; which damages all enemies on the screen. In the game&#x27;s other versions except for Famicom version, all gameplay information is displayed on the left and top edges of the screen; there is no need to access a separate screen.

Throughout the game, the player must investigate the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information needed in the quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits to the next level which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level&#x27;s bosses; near the end of the game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.

There are many items and treasures located throughout the game. Many of these treasures are obtained by defeating enemies and include the following: gold; golden water jugs, necklaces, scales of justice, harps, mirrors, and crowns which increase the player&#x27;s score; hourglasses which refill the Hourglass Timer; hearts which refill the life meter; gauntlets which temporarily double Wonder Boy&#x27;s attack power; helmets which temporarily provide additional protection from enemy attacks; Wing Boots which allow Wonder Boy to fly over obstacles; Revival Potions; and magic mantles which make Wonder Boy temporarily invisible. Other special items hidden in the game which the player must find include letters, the flute, various charms, the bell, and the ruby.

==Development==
&quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; was created by Ryuchi Nishizawa and Michishisto Ishizuka, two of the three members of a newly founded company called Escape. After the release of the first &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; game, they rebranded the company as &quot;Westone&quot;: the first letter in Nishizawa&#x27;s name means &quot;west&quot;, while the first on Ishizuka&#x27;s name means &quot;stone&quot;. Nishizawa, originally an arcade game developer, was trying to take advantage of the quickly emerging role-playing video game genre, with games such as &quot;The Black Onyx&quot;, &quot;Wizardry&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest.&quot; He tried to create a game that fused together arcade and RPG elements. Two earlier games Nishizawa had played which fused arcade and RPG elements were &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot; and &quot;Dragon Buster&quot; from Namco, but he was &quot;irritated&quot; with how those games were designed. He also had an issue with there being &quot;no one to talk to&quot; during the dungeons in &quot;Wizardry&quot; as well as the stages in &quot;The Tower of Druaga&quot; and &quot;Dragon Buster&quot;.

The jungle backdrop was overhauled and replaced with a medieval one with castles and caves. As with RPGs, he intended for the player to start with no items or strength, and for players to buy items, spells, health, and better equipment. Later in the game&#x27;s development, Shinichi Sakamoto came on board to compose its soundtrack; in an overview of the series by IGN, they said that the music &quot;was a sigh of relief for those still haunted by the repetitive loops of the arcade original&quot;, adding that it contributed to the RPG style and that would establish the standard for all future &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; games in the series.

==Ports and remakes==
The game would be published by Sega in 1987 and released in Japanese arcades. It ran on a Sega System 2 board. It was based on a Z80 processor that runs at 4 MHz, with audio provided by two SN76489 (also known as SN76496) chips that run at 4 MHz each. It used raster standard graphics and monaural sound. Upon its release for the arcades in Japan in 1987, &quot;Wonder Boy: Monster Land&quot; had slow sales, but it would eventually pick up to become a decent seller. Before Sega published it on its own console, Hudson obtained the rights and program from Escape (Westone) and published it on the PC Engine under the name &quot;Bikkuriman World&quot; in October 1987. Since Hudson did not have the rights for the Wonder Boy franchise, the story and graphics were changed to fit the Bikkuriman franchise instead, while keeping the same gameplay. Sega ported the game to its Master System console in 1988, where in Japan it was titled &quot;Super Wonder Boy: Monster World&quot;. Jaleco published a Famicom port in Japan in 1988 titled &quot;Saiyūki World&quot;, developed by NMK, which spawned an independently created sequel, &quot;Saiyūki World 2&quot;, released in North America as &quot;Whomp &#x27;Em&quot;. It was also ported by Images Software for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum and published by Activision in 1989. The Activision-published version bore the title of &quot;Super Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; on their packaging artwork. Hudson Soft released a version of the game titled &quot;Super Adventure Island&quot; for mobile phones on . The Master System version was released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in Japan on , in Europe on , and in North America on . Sega released the arcade version for the Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade (along with &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot;, &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot;, the Arcade port of &quot;Super Hang-On&quot;, &quot;Monster World IV&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster World&quot;) as part of its third &quot;Sega Vintage Collection&quot; package in May 2012.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; on their October 1, 1987 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the fortnight. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a positive review, published in January 1989, calling it a &quot;highly enjoyable&quot; game.

The Master System version of the game was reviewed in the June 1988 issue of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, which gave it an overall score of 9 out of 10. It described the game as a &quot;total mix of arcade, strategy and adventure&quot; with &quot;role playing elements&quot; such as &quot;interaction with other characters and the ability to develop your character&quot;. It further stated that the &quot;graphics rate as some of the best seen to date on a Sega game&quot; and the &quot;playability is supreme&quot;, concluding that it pushes its game design &quot;to new horizons, all of which makes for longterm playability and interest&quot;. It was also reviewed in the April 1989 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers called it &quot;a good game with a bad name&quot;, considered the game play superb, and concluded that the game &quot;is one of SEGA&#x27;s classic products&quot;. They stated that the arcade and role-playing action elements combine to make it &quot;a truly original and enjoyable game&quot; and that Sega has &quot;done an excellent job&quot; overall, giving the game 4½ out of 5 stars. Allgame also gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars, with reviewer Jonathan Sutyak describing it as &quot;one of the best games I have ever played on the Master System&quot;. IGN in 2009 described the Virtual Console release as an &quot;interesting platformer/RPG hybrid&quot; game.

The ZX Spectrum version of &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; received preview coverage in &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; magazine. They praised the new additions made to the game that separated it from &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;; they called the game &quot;a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in&quot;. The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many &quot;surprises&quot; the player will encounter, and they praised the game&#x27;s learning curve, saying that it &quot;is well thought out and you really feel as if you made some progress before you die&quot;. It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZX Spectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character &quot;floats around&quot;, and the graphics which was not as good as its predecessor. The reviewer called &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; &quot;a souped-up version of &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay&quot;. Reviewers from UK-based magazine &quot;The Games Machine&quot; called it &quot;probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum&quot;. &quot;Crash&quot; magazine praised the ZX Spectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for the differences that set it apart from the original &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is &quot;great fun for the experienced games player or the person just starting out in the Spectrum world&quot;. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine &quot;MicroHobby&quot; said that the ZX Spectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game&#x27;s graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.

The Commodore 64 and Atari ST versions of &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; also received similar praise from gaming magazines. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; praised the Atari ST version but criticized the Commodore 64 version. The reviewers said the former &quot;is not only playable, but the graphics are the nearest to the arcade machine you&#x27;re going to get&quot;; however, they said the graphics in the latter, while colorful, were too block-like and ruined its overall presentation. Reviewers from &quot;Zzap!64&quot; criticized the Commodore 64 version, saying that this version is only slightly better and more playable than the Amiga version. Moreover, they said this version also suffered from repetitive gameplay and &quot;inefficient multi-load&quot;, though an improvement from the Amiga version. &quot;Zero&quot; gave a fair assessment of the Atari ST version, appreciating the &quot;cutesy&quot; and cartoon-like graphics and addicting gameplay, which the reviewer said is &quot;very easy to get into and very hard to put down&quot;; they criticized the game&#x27;s lack of any save features, saying that some of the gameplay gets repetitive after a while. Swedish magazine &quot;Datormagazin&quot; acclaimed the Commodore 64 version in most aspects. They lauded its graphics for being simplistic but clean, but they noted that they were not sensational. They criticized the game for its music, which they said can become annoying after a while, and for its lack of save points. Overall, they gave a positive review, saying that it &quot;is a perfect example of how to make a game that is fairly simple to play but still is fairly advanced&quot;.

The Amiga version of &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; received mixed responses, but most reviews were negative. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; magazine expressed disappointment over the major change in the gameplay and the protagonist himself from the game&#x27;s predecessor. The review also criticized sharply the game&#x27;s poor graphics and character sprites, saying that &quot;many of the characters are short and stumpy&quot;, that the background resembles that of &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, and that Wonder Boy &quot;is as wide as he is tall&quot;. Other criticisms included substandard screen scrolling, terrible gameplay due to the game&#x27;s slowness, and that the actual gameplay area has been drastically reduced in size to include gameplay statistics such as the life meter and score displays. IGN heavily criticized the Amiga version 20 years after its release, saying how Wonder Boy was depicted as &quot;a diaper-clad baby&quot;. &quot;Amiga Format&quot; similarly gave the game poor ratings, including the small gameplay area as a result of displaying the other statistics, sound that is substandard to the Amiga computer&#x27;s expectations, the lack of a &quot;high score&quot; feature, and limited continues (as opposed to the arcade version which had unlimited continues). The reviewer said that &quot;the game hasn&#x27;t been programmed to make use of any of the Amiga&#x27;s features&quot; and that it &quot;is another in the sadly increasing number of games that has simply been ported over from the first conversion, so that none of the features that make Amiga games stand out are included&quot;. &quot;Zzap!64&quot; complained about the version&#x27;s &quot;beepy&quot; sound and the very slow multi-load times, saying that the player may spend more time waiting for the game to load levels than play it. It also noted the lack of detail and variety in the graphics which did not make up for the slow multi-load times; the reviewer said that the enemies looked &quot;about as dangerous as a dead tortoise&quot;. Other reviews from computer magazines gave the Amiga version of the game more positive reviews. &quot;Amiga User International&quot; praised the game&#x27;s graphics, which they said were translated from the arcade version near-perfectly. It also appreciated the game&#x27;s cartoon-style graphics, which said befits the game well. However, the review noticed that the game&#x27;s code came from the Atari ST version, which, as noted in the other reviews, resulted in choppy scrolling and a shrunken gameplay area: something which the Amiga could do &quot;perfectly smoothly with one hand tied behind its back&quot;. The review also criticized its slow multi-load times and high retail price. German magazine &quot;Amiga Joker&quot; liked the game&#x27;s &quot;candy-like graphics&quot; and gameplay style, which they said compared to the title &quot;The Great Giana Sisters&quot;. However, the reviewers criticized it for its choppy scrolling and sound, of which they said &quot;David Whittaker has already produced much better sound&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; received additional coverage years after its release. A 2004 review from Honest Gamers highly lauded its gameplay, challenge, and sound. It noted that while the game starts easy, the difficulty increases at a decent rate and involves good general gameplay skills that serve to add to the gameplay value. The reviewer praised the sound for being simple yet very effective, saying that it &quot;is the ultimate compliment to pay a video game score&quot; and comparing it to other Master System titles such as &quot;Alex Kidd&quot;. A 2008 IGN feature listed the game as one of &quot;The 7 Master System Games You Need&quot;; the reviewer said the game &quot;is one of the finest adventures in a long series of [&quot;Wonder Boy&quot;] games&quot;, praising its brightly colored graphics and character sprites, and its sound. IGN had its sequel, &quot;Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap&quot;, at No. 8 on their list, just missing also being featured.

The game received further reviews and general praise upon its release to the Virtual Console in 2009. Website Nintendo Life praised the game&#x27;s controls for being smooth and responsive, especially for such an old game. The review appreciated its graphics, especially in its sharpness and usage of color; it further lauded the game&#x27;s upbeat sound that complements the game nicely, the varied level designs and gameplay elements such as the need to answer questions from some bosses, and its overall execution. It said that the game is one of the better Master System titles that still plays good today. IGN called &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; one of the best games on the Master System, mainly because of its unique balance of platforming and RPG elements, which the reviewer calls &quot;a winning formula&quot;. It said that the game is an improvement over its &quot;Adventure Island&quot;-like predecessor, replacing the &quot;fruit gauge&quot; with an hourglass timer while retaining other elements such as finding invisible items and discovering secret areas. The review mentioned that the game should appeal to fans from the days of 8-bit and the Master System.

Allgame gave positive reviews of the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; the most challenging game in the &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said that the ability to earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.

<doc id="436021" wikidata="Q7377353" url="?curid=436021" title="Rudolf Wanderone">
<text>Rudolf Walter Wanderone (né Rudolf Walter Wanderon Jr.; January 19, 1913 – January 15, 1996), commonly known as Minnesota Fats, was an American professional pool player. Although he never won a major pool tournament as &quot;Fats&quot;, he was at one time perhaps the most publicly recognized pool player in the United States—not only as a player, but also as an entertainer. Wanderone was inducted in 1984 into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame for his decades-long public promotion of pool.

Wanderone began playing at a young age in New York City. As a teenager, he became a traveling pool hustler. Later, in his thirties, he moved to Du Quoin, Illinois, where he met and married his first wife, Evelyn. She was a waitress at a steakhouse, The Perfection Club. They married two months after they met. During World War II, he hustled servicemen in Norfolk, Virginia. With the end of the war, Wanderone returned to Illinois and entered semi-retirement.

Wanderone, who was sometimes known by the nickname &quot;New York Fats&quot; in his role as a pool player, adopted the name &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; from the character of that name in the 1961 film &quot;The Hustler&quot;, claiming that the character, played by Jackie Gleason, was based upon him.

He parlayed the association with the film into his own book deals and television appearances, including a series of matches with rival Willie Mosconi. Later in life, Wanderone divorced Evelyn and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he married his second wife, Theresa, with whom he remained until his death.

==Early life and career==
Wanderone was born in New York City to Rudolf Walter Wanderon and his wife, Rose ( Rosa Burgin); both Swiss immigrants who married in New York. One of three siblings (he had two sisters), Rudolf Jr. was born in 1913, but sometimes hinted he was born earlier, even as early as 1900. 
Known as &quot;Rudy&quot; to friends and family, Wanderone started playing pool as a child while living in Washington Heights, Manhattan. In 1923, he traveled with his father to Europe, where he received training from German balkline billiards champion Erich Hagenlocher. His first prominent match was in 1926, when he competed against former nine-ball champion &quot;Cowboy&quot; Weston; Wanderone won, handily. Wanderone left school in the eighth grade and became a traveling pool hustler, spending much of the 1920s playing at a pool hall called Cranfield&#x27;s in New York City, where he received his first nickname after beating another hustler known as &quot;Smart Henry&quot;. The intensity of their competition led Wanderone&#x27;s friend Titanic Thompson to dub Wanderone &quot;Double-Smart&quot;. By the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression, Wanderone had become a manager of a pool hall, owned by a friend, in Anacostia, southeast Washington, D.C. He had acquired more notoriety and nicknames, including &quot;Triple-Smart Fats&quot;, &quot;New York Fats&quot;, &quot;Broadway Fats&quot;, and &quot;Chicago Fats&quot;, attracting from other hustlers, including the then-unknown Luther &quot;Wimpy&quot; Lassiter.

In 1941, Wanderone and friend Jimmy Castras arrived in southern Illinois—a major hustling center on a fast track to televised tournament play—and settled in Du Quoin, Illinois, where he continued hustling. Eventually, he met Evelyn Inez Graff; they married two months to the day later, on May 7, 1941. Following their wedding, the Wanderones settled in Dowell, Illinois where they lived a quiet life, residing at 611 South Street. In 1942, the couple moved to Norfolk, Virginia. Norfolk had become a key mustering point for American soldiers, as well as a shipbuilding center. The growing population led to an enormous interest in gambling; Wanderone, in partnership with fellow hustler Lassiter, quickly recognized the financial possibilities. Following World War II, however, the action soon &quot;dried up&quot;, and the Wanderones returned to Little Egypt, Illinois. Throughout the 1950s, Wanderone was in semi-retirement, making only occasional hustling trips to New York City.

==&quot;Minnesota Fats&quot;==
In 1961, the film version of Walter Tevis&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Hustler&quot; was released. The film tells the story of a pool shark named &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson and his quest to beat the greatest pool player in America, &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot;. World Champion Willie Mosconi served as a technical advisor and trick shot stunt man for the film. Wanderone almost immediately dropped his &quot;New York Fats&quot; nickname, adopted the name &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot;, and began spreading the story that the character was based on him. Tevis denied this for the rest of his life. However, Derek Kirunchyk examined the pages of Tevis&#x27; original manuscript and discovered that Tevis had changed the character&#x27;s nickname from &quot;New York&quot; to &quot;Minnesota&quot; in one of the original manuscript pages, lending credence to Fats&#x27; claim that he was the inspiration for the character.
Wanderone&#x27;s notoriety as &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; led to a job as executive vice-president of billiard table manufacturer Rozel Industries, playing exhibition matches and giving demonstrations. Rozel, in 1965, published Fats&#x27; first book: &quot;Minnesota &quot;Fats&quot; Book of Billiards&quot;. On January 17, 1965, he appeared on the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, successfully stumping the panel.

In 1966, he wrote his autobiography, &quot;The Bank Shot, and Other Great Robberies&quot;, with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; journalist Tom Fox. His first television game show, &quot;Minnesota Fats Hustles the Pros&quot;, debuted in 1967, featuring &quot;Fats&quot; playing against other pro players.

In 1967 he completed and published an instructional paperback, &quot;Minnesota Fats on Pool&quot;, which was reprinted through 1976 in large-quantity editions, was then reissued as a hardcover in 1993, and remains to this day commonly available.

The next year, on January 24, 1968, Fats was a guest on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;. By 1970, &quot;Celebrity Billiards with Minnesota Fats&quot;, another short-lived television game show series, featured Fats playing against celebrity guests such as Sid Caesar.

In a feature film entitled &quot;The Player&quot; (produced in December 1970, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana), Fats played himself as &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; and was featured prominently on the promotional poster. The screenplay was written and directed by Thomas DeMartini, also starred pool pro Jack Colavita, and had a limited release in 1971 by International Cinema. That same year Fats was a guest on both &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (September 21, 1971), on which he hustled Carson out of US$1, and the British &quot;David Frost Show&quot; (October 13, 1971). His fame as &quot;Fats&quot; had already made it difficult for Fats to hustle effectively, so he relied more and more on exhibition games for income.

By 1979, Fats was well known enough to play himself as a celebrity guest star on a season 2 episode of the popular television detective drama &quot;Vega$&quot; titled &quot;the Usurper&quot;. The episode featured &quot;Fats&quot; and pro Jimmy Mataya playing one another in a game of pool. In 1980, while visiting a one-mile stretch of St. Louis, Fats had to double his order of autographed pictures after he was stopped thirty-seven times. During this trip he was beaten by Michael Boulton 4 out of 10 times in games of pool.

==Rivalry with Willie Mosconi==
Fats enjoyed promoting a feud with world champion Mosconi over how to present pool—either as a rough-and-tumble gambling game (Fats) or as a genteel pastime and art form (Mosconi). Mosconi&#x27;s widow, Flora, said of the rivalry, &quot;My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that [Wanderone] was always hurting the image of the game instead of helping it.&quot; Fats would state smugly, &quot;I may have &#x27;given away&#x27; a few games to deserving competitors, but I have never lost a real money game since I was old enough to spell &#x27;Weeli Mesconi&#x27;.&quot; The two competed on Valentine&#x27;s Day (February 14), 1978 in a televised match on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. With almost 11 million viewers, the game was the second-highest-rated episode of the show for that year, behind only the Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks rematch. The game was held at New York&#x27;s Waldorf Astoria Hotel and was announced by Howard Cosell. Although Fats lost the game, he won the audience with his banter and with his joking manner. Mosconi, on the other hand, was reportedly perceived as cold.

&quot;Fats&quot; lost a number of rematches to Mosconi in the following years. However, in the nationally broadcast &quot;Resorts International Shoot-Out&quot; of October 1984—Fats&#x27; last notable television appearance—he finally turned the tables on his rival. The event began with a trick shot competition among four players—Fats, Mosconi, Steve Mizerak, and Allen Hopkins.

Next, Hopkins and Fats played against Mosconi and Mizerak in doubles seven-ball, then nine-ball. Fats and Mosconi ultimately played a one-on-one game of seven-ball; Fats won the match. During the exhibition, a very quiet and genteel Mosconi blocked Fats&#x27; rough-and-tumble banter by wearing ear plugs; yet that failed to stop Fats from putting on a show for his fans. In an interview, Fats was asked about his strategy to defeat Mosconi and replied that he had thought to himself, &quot;I&#x27;ll make [the 7 ball] on the break and end it... then I&#x27;ll help carry Willie out on a stretcher.&quot;

==Later life==
The Billiard Congress of America in 1984 inducted Fats into its Hall of Fame for &quot;Meritorious Service&quot; in recognition of his contributions to helping popularize the game of pool. In 1984, Fats abandoned his wife, Evelyn; they divorced a year later.

Fats moved into the Hermitage Hotel in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, in 1985, remaining there for several years. In 1992, while undergoing surgery for a knee injury, he survived a massive heart attack. In 1993, he met and married his second wife, Teresa Talley Bell. He lived in Bell&#x27;s Nashville house until his death on January 15, 1996, four days shy of his 83rd birthday, although some sources, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, erroneously gave the date of his death as January 18.
Fats had no known children. Singer Etta James said she believed that he was her biological father, having reportedly been told that by her mother as well as by others who knew her mother and whom James described as &quot;people who were there and should know&quot;. However, there is no published evidence of such a relationship. James and Fats are only known to have met once, in 1987.

In her autobiography, &quot;Rage to Survive&quot;, James recounted their meeting, writing that Fats neither confirmed nor denied his paternity. According to James, he told her that he did not recall the details of his life at the time of her conception well enough to know whether he could have been the father.

The epitaph on his tombstone reads: &quot;Beat every living creature on Earth. &#x27;St. Peter, rack &#x27;em up. — Fats.

==Personal character==
Fats was known for ostentation, self-aggrandizement, tall tales, fast talk, and entertaining banter. He was even publicly recognized by famed boaster Muhammad Ali as better at boasting. His critical biographer, R.A. Dyer, documents that Fats completely fabricated a &quot;here-by-fate&quot; tale about a car wreck which brought the player to Little Egypt; it was a tale that Fats encouraged to be spread and further embellished in his autobiography to lend an air of the mystical to his public persona. He made false claims about beating Willie Mosconi so frequently that Mosconi filed a slander lawsuit, to little avail.

According to Dyer, Fats was notorious for nonstop chatter on subjects about which he knew little, or stories about himself. At the beginning of his first television match against Mosconi, Fats claimed: &quot;I&#x27;ve never lost [a game] for money in my &quot;life&quot;; beat everyone that ever lived.&quot; Yet, as Dyer concedes, &quot;Pool hustlers are, by nature, liars. And by this measure, Minnesota Fats was just a very, very good pool hustler.&quot;

Fats was a lover of animals and was reported to have had dozens of cats and dogs simultaneously, and to have devoted a lot of time to finding homes for strays. &quot;I&#x27;m crazy about every living creature&quot;, he wrote in &quot;The Bank Shot&quot;. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what it happens to be. I even love insects; in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t swat a fly or a mosquito for a whole barrel of gold.&quot;
Remembered well for his turns of phrase and his puns, Fats once wrote, &quot;If you happened to drive from Mobile to Dowell [Illinois] with a carload of pool hustlers, you would get bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well&quot;, a reference not only to the area&#x27;s notorious mosquitos but also to the predatory nature of hustlers. Fats is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, &quot;Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg.&quot; Fats would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd pleaser.

Fats owned various limousines throughout his career. He once toured the country in a colorful Lincoln limousine with his extended moniker painted along the side panels in translucent paint, changing colors as it moved with the reflections from the sun: &quot;Minnesota Fats, King of Pool&quot;. His 1980 Cadillac Fleetwood limousine was later in the Nashville auto museum, until the facility closed.

Fats was notorious for his spontaneous wit. When he was named the &quot;uncrowned king&quot; of pool because he never got actively involved in tournament circles (owing to being too busy hustling), his reply: &quot;You judge a king by the size of his wallet and his palace. You can leave the crown in the toilet.&quot;

<text>The disability rights movement is a global social movement that seeks to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for all disabled people.

It is made up of organizations of disability activists, also known as disability advocates, around the world working together with similar goals and demands, such as: accessibility and safety in architecture, transportation, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment equity, education, and housing; and freedom from discrimination, abuse, neglect, and from other rights violations. Disability activists are working to break institutional, physical, and societal barriers that prevent people with disabilities from living their lives like other citizens.

Disability rights is complex because there are multiple ways in which a person with a disability can have their rights violated in different socio-political, cultural, and legal contexts. For example, a common barrier that individuals with disabilities face deals with employment. Specifically, employers are often unwilling or unable to provide the necessary accommodations to enable individuals with disabilities to effectively carry out their job functions.

== History ==

===United States===

American disability rights have evolved significantly over the past century. Before the disability rights movement, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s refusal to be publicized in a position of vulnerability demonstrated and symbolized the existing stigma surrounding disabilities. While campaigning, giving speeches, or acting as a public figure, he hid his disability. This perpetuated the ideology that &quot;disability equates to weakness&quot;.

Disability in the United States was viewed as a personal issue, and not many political or governmental organizations existed to support individuals in these groups. In the 1950s, there was a transition to volunteerism and parent-oriented organizations, such as the March of Dimes. While this was the beginning of activism and seeking support for these groups, children with disabilities were largely hidden by their parents out of fear of forced rehabilitation. When the civil rights movement took off in the 1960s, disability advocates joined it and the women&#x27;s rights movements in order to promote equal treatment and challenge stereotypes. It was at this time that disability rights advocacy began to have a cross-disability focus. People with different kinds of disabilities (physical and mental disabilities, along with visual and hearing disabilities) and different essential needs came together to fight for a common cause.

It was not until 1990 that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed, legally prohibiting discrimination on account of disability, and mandating disability access in all buildings and public areas. The ADA is historically significant in that it defined the meaning of reasonable accommodation in order to protect employees and employers. Today, disability rights advocates continue protecting those who are discriminated against, including work towards issues like law enforcement and treatment of people with disabilities.

===United Nations===
On a global scale, the United Nations has established the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, specifically discussing indigenous people with disabilities (Lockwood 146).

== Disability barriers ==


The social model of disability suggests disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person&#x27;s impairment. This model suggests barriers in society are created by ableism. When barriers are removed, people with disabilities can be independent and equal in society.

There are three main types of barriers:

#Attitudinal barriers: are created by people who see only disability when associating with people with disabilities in some way. These attitudinal barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers. Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.
#Environmental barriers: inaccessible environments, natural or built, create disability by creating barriers to inclusion.
#Institutional barriers: include many laws, policies, practices, or strategies that discriminate against people with disabilities. For example, a study of five Southeast Asian countries found that electoral laws do not specially protect the political rights of persons with disabilities, while &quot;some banks do not allow visually disabled people to open accounts, and HIV testing centers often refuse to accept sign language interpreters due to confidentiality policies&quot;. Restrictive laws exist in some countries, particularly affecting people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.

Other barriers include: internalised barriers (low expectations of people with disabilities can undermine their confidence and aspirations), inadequate data and statistics, lack of participation and consultation of disabled people.

== Issues ==

===People with physical disabilities===
Access to public areas such as city streets, public buildings, and restrooms are some of the more visible changes brought about in recent decades to remove physical barriers. A noticeable change in some parts of the world is the installation of elevators, automatic doors, wide doors and corridors, transit lifts, wheelchair ramps, curb cuts, and the elimination of unnecessary steps where ramps and elevators are not available, allowing wheelchair users and with other mobility disabilities to use public sidewalks and public transit more easily and safely.

====People with visual disabilities====
People with color vision deficiency regularly deal with implicit discrimination due to their inability to distinguish certain colors. A system of geometrically shaped code signs known as Coloradd was developed by Professor Miguel Neiva of the University of Minho, Portugal, in 2010 to indicate colours to people who have difficulty discerning them.

===People with intellectual and developmental disabilities===
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities focus their efforts on ensuring that they have the same human rights as other people and that they are treated like human beings. Since the formation of the self advocacy movement in the 1960s, the largest focus of the movement has been to get people with I/DD out of institutions and into the community. Another main focus is ensuring that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are in integrated workplaces that pay at least minimum wage. In the US, it is still legal to pay people with I/DD below minimum wage in sheltered workshops. Many people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are put under guardianship and are not allowed to make their own decisions about their lives.

Another issue is the continued dehumanization of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, which prompted the slogan People First, still used as a rallying cry and a common organizational name in the self advocacy movement. Self advocates are also involved in the &quot;R-Word&quot; Campaign, in which they try to eliminate the use of the word &quot;retard&quot;. Self advocates successfully advocated to change the name of the Arc.

=== Autism rights movement ===
The autism rights movement is a social movement that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates for several goals, including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than imitating the behaviors of neurotypical peers; the creation of social networks and events that allow autistic people to socialize on their own terms; and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is primarily genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines.

The movement is controversial. A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are &quot;high-functioning&quot; or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of &quot;low-functioning&quot; autistic people.

=== People with mental health issues ===
Advocates for the rights of people with mental health disabilities focus mainly on self-determination, and an individual&#x27;s ability to live independently.

The right to have an independent life, using paid assistant care instead of being institutionalized, if the individual wishes, is a major goal of the disability rights movement, and is the main goal of the similar independent living and self-advocacy movements, which are most strongly associated with people with intellectual disabilities and mental health disorders. These movements have supported people with disabilities to live as more active participants in society.

=== Access to education and employment ===
Access to education and employment have also been a major focus of the disability rights movement. Adaptive technologies, enabling people to work jobs they could not have previously, help create access to jobs and economic independence. Access in the classroom has helped improve education opportunities and independence for people with disabilities.

=== Freedom from discrimination and abuse ===
Freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of a person&#x27;s rights are also important goals of the disability rights movement. Abuse and neglect includes inappropriate seclusion and restraint, inappropriate use of force by staff and/or providers, threats, harassment and/or retaliation by staff or providers, failure to provide adequate nutrition, clothing, and/or medical and mental health care, and/or failure to provide a clean and safe living environment, as well as other issues which pose a serious threat to the physical and psychological well-being of a person with a disability. Violations of patients&#x27; rights include failure to obtain informed consent for treatment, failure to maintain the confidentiality of treatment records, and inappropriate restriction of the right to communicate and associate with others, as well as other restrictions of rights.

As a result of the work done through the disability rights movement, significant disability rights legislation was passed in the 1970s through the 1990s in the U.S.

==Major events==
=== Australia ===
In 1978 protests outside Australia&#x27;s Parliament House in Canberra helped force the government to rescind taxes on government payments to people with disability. Demonstrations inside and outside parliament since been held regarding various issues, leading to an expansion of the National Attendant Care Scheme in 1992 and helping to convince the federal government to establish the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability in 2019. Similar protests outside state parliaments have fed into campaigns for improved rights and funding, leading to improvements in supported accommodation in New South Wales in 1994 and continued support for Queensland disability advocacy services in 2021.

Beginning in 1981, the International Year of the Disabled Person, campaigners targeted beauty pageants such as the Miss Australia Quest in order to, in the words of activist Leslie Hall, &quot;challenge the notion of beauty&quot; and &quot;reject the charity ethic.&quot; High profile demonstrations led to some charities abandoning their use of such contests for fundraising and also saw some remove offensive language from their organisational titles.

Following a long nationwide campaign involving hundreds of thousands of people the National Disability Insurance Scheme was introduced in Australia in 2013 to fund a number of supports.

National campaigns by groups such as Every Australian Counts have since been launched to extend the scheme and protect it from cuts and restrictions on access.

=== Canada ===
Canada&#x27;s largest province, Ontario, created legislation, Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, with the goals of becoming accessible by 2025.

In 2019, the Accessible Canada Act became law. This is the first national Canadian legislation on accessibility that affects all government departments and federally regulated agencies.

===India===
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 is the disability legislation passed by the Indian Parliament to fulfill its obligation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which India ratified in 2007. The Act replaced the existing Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. It came into effect on 28 December 2016. This law recognizes 21 disabilities.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, following extensive activism by people with disabilities over several decades, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995) was passed. This made it unlawful in the United Kingdom to discriminate against people with disabilities in relation to employment, the provision of goods and services, education and transport. The Equality and Human Rights Commission provides support for this Act. Equivalent legislation exists in Northern Ireland, which is enforced by the Northern Ireland Equality Commission.

Following the introduction of the Bedroom Tax (officially the Under-occupancy penalty) in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, disability activists have played a significant role in the development of Bedroom Tax protests. A wide range of benefit changes are estimated to affect disabled people disproportionately and to compromise disabled people&#x27;s right to independent living.

The Down Syndrome Bill created by Evan Mitchell OBE will provide legal recognition to people living with Down syndrome.

===United States===

In 1948, a watershed for the movement was the proof of the existence of physical and program barriers. The proof was provided as a specification for barrier free usable facilities for people with disabilities. The specifications provided the minimum requirements for barrier free physical and program access. An example of barriers are; providing only steps to enter buildings; lack of maintenance of walkways; locations not connected with public transit; lack of visual and hearing communications ends up segregating individuals with disabilities from independent, participation, and opportunities. The ANSI - Barrier Free Standard (phrase coined by Timothy Nugent, the lead investigator) called &quot;ANSI A117.1, Making Buildings Accessible to and Usable by the Physically Handicapped&quot;, provides the indisputable proof that the barriers exist. The standard is the outcome of physical therapists, bio-mechanical engineers, and individuals with disabilities who developed and participated in over 40 years of research. The standard provides the criteria for modifying programs and the physical site to provide independence. The standard has been emulated globally since its introduction in Europe, Asia, Japan, Australia, and Canada, in the early 1960s.

One of the most important developments of the disability rights movement was the growth of the independent living movement, which emerged in California in the 1960s through the efforts of Edward Roberts and other wheelchair-using individuals. This movement, a subset of the disability rights movement, postulates that people with disabilities are the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the independent living movement&#x27;s ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the independent living movement regardless of diagnoses). Similarly, the Architectural Barriers Act was passed in 1968, mandating that federally constructed buildings and facilities be accessible to people with physical disabilities. This act is generally considered to be the first ever-federal disability rights legislation. Unfortunately for those with cognitive disabilities, their disability made it more difficult to be the best expert of their own needs, hindering their ability to self-advocate as their wheelchair-using counterparts could. Self-representation was much more difficult for those who could not articulate their thoughts, leading to their dependence on others to carry on the movement.

In 1973 the (American) Rehabilitation Act became law; Sections 501, 503, and 504 prohibited discrimination in federal programs and services and all other programs or services receiving federal funds. Key language in the Rehabilitation Act, found in Section 504, states &quot;No otherwise qualified handicapped &#x27; individual in the United States, shall, solely by reason of his &#x27; handicap &quot;&quot;, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.&quot; The act also specifies money that can be allocated to help disabled people receive training for the work force as well as to assist in making sure that they can then reach work without running into inaccessibility problems. This was the first civil rights law guaranteeing equal opportunity for people with disabilities.

Another crucial turning point was the 504 Sit-in in 1977 of government buildings operated by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), conceived by Frank Bowe and organized by the American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities, that led to the release of regulations pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. On April 5, 1977, activists began to demonstrate and some sat-in in the offices found in ten of the federal regions including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. One of the most noteworthy protests occurred in San Francisco. The protesters demanded the signing of regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.The successful sit-in was led by Judith Heumann. The first day of protests marked the first of a 25-day sit-in. Close to 120 disability activists and protesters occupied the HEW building, and Secretary Joseph Califano finally signed on April 28, 1977. This protest was significant not only because its goal was achieved, but also because it was the foremost concerted effort between people of different disabilities coming together in support of legislation that affected the overall disability population, rather than only specific groups.

In 1978 disability rights activists in Denver, Colorado, organized by the Atlantis Community, held a sit-in and blockade of the Denver Regional Transit Authority buses in 1978. They were protesting the fact that city&#x27;s transit system was completely inaccessible for physically disabled people. This action proved to be just the first in a series of civil disobedience demonstrations that lasted for a year until the Denver Transit Authority finally bought buses equipped with wheelchair lifts. In 1983, Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) was responsible for another civil disobedience campaign also in Denver that lasted seven years. They targeted the American Public Transport Association in protest of inaccessible public transportation; this campaign ended in 1990 when bus lifts for people using wheelchairs were required nationwide by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Another significant protest related to disability rights was the Deaf President Now protest by the Gallaudet University students in Washington, D.C., in March 1988. The eight-day (March 6 – March 13) demonstration and occupation and lock-out of the school began when the Board of Trustees appointed a new hearing President, Elisabeth Zinser, over two Deaf candidates. The students&#x27; primary grievance was that the university, which was dedicated to the education of people who are Deaf, had never had a Deaf president, someone representative of them. Of the protesters&#x27; four demands, the main one was the resignation of the current president and the appointment of a Deaf one. The demonstration consisted of about 2,000 student and nonstudent participants. The protests took place on campus, in government buildings, and in the streets. In the end, all the students&#x27; demands were met and I. King Jordan was appointed the first Deaf President of the university.

In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act became law, and it provided comprehensive civil rights protection for people with disabilities. Closely modeled after the Civil Rights Act and Section 504, the law was the most sweeping disability rights legislation in American history. It mandated that local, state, and federal governments and programs be accessible, that employers with more than 15 employees make &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; for workers with disabilities and not discriminate against otherwise qualified workers with disabilities, and that public accommodations such as restaurants and stores not discriminate against people with disabilities and that they make reasonable modifications to ensure access for disabled members of the public. The act also mandated access in public transportation, communication, and in other areas of public life.

The first Disability Pride March in the United States was held in Boston in 1990. A second Disability Pride March was held in Boston in 1991. There were no subsequent Disability Pride Marches/Parades for many years, until Chicago on Sunday, July 18, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.itodaynews.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded with $10,000 in seed money that Sarah Triano received in 2003 as part of the Paul G. Hearne Leadership award from the American Association of People with Disabilities. According to Triano, 1,500 people attended the parade. Yoshiko Dart was the parade marshal.

==Exhibitions and collections==
To mark the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History opened an exhibition that examined the history of activism by people with disabilities, their friends, and families to secure the civil rights guaranteed to all Americans. Objects on view included the pen President George H. W. Bush used to sign the Act and one of the first ultralight wheelchairs. The exhibition was designed for maximum accessibility. Web-based kiosks - prototypes for a version that will eventually be available to museums and other cultural institutions - provided alternate formats to experience the exhibition. The exhibition was open from July 6, 2000, to July 23, 2001.

== Debates and approaches ==
A key debate in the disability rights movement is between affirmative action for persons with disabilities versus fighting for equitable treatment. According to a 1992 polling organization, many fear that integrating people with disabilities into the workplace may affect their company image, or it may result in decreased productivity. This coincides with the 1992 parliamentary review of the Employment Equity Act, which stated that employers should look to implement equity without having an official quota system. This remains an ongoing debate.

An additional debate is between institutionalizing persons with disabilities versus supporting them in their homes. In 1963 during John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency, he transformed the national view of mental health by boosting funding for community-based programs and drafting legislation for mental health care. He also created the President&#x27;s Panel on Mental Retardation, which created recommendations for new programs that governments can implement on a state level, therefore moving away from &quot;custodial institutions&quot;. This shift away from institutionalization has generated a long-lasting stigma against mental health institutions, which is why in politics there is often not enough funding for this concept.

According to the US Supreme Court case &quot;Humphrey v. Cady&quot;, civil commitment laws and eligibility for intervention exist only in the instance when the person is ruled an immediate danger to themself or others. The difficulty of proving &quot;immediate danger&quot; has led to the unexpected outcome that it is harder to commit mentally ill patients to hospital and easier to send them to prison. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, about 15% male inmates and 30% female inmates have some kind of serious mental illness which remains untreated.

Another ongoing debate is how to cultivate self-determination for persons with disabilities. The common article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights asserts that &quot;All peoples have the right to self-determination&quot; with free will. Because this highlights the concept of free and autonomous choice, one argument is that any government interference deters self-determination, thus leaving it to persons with disabilities to seek out any help they need from charities and nonprofit organizations. Charitable organizations such as churches believe in helping persons with disabilities with nothing in return. On the other hand, another approach is a participatory, symbiotic relationship, which include methods like professional development and resource provisions. More specifically, one approach is to allow persons with disabilities to self-articulate their needs and generate their own solutions and analyses. Instead of passive participation, which is participation by being told what to do or what has been done, this approach proposes to allow this group to be self-sufficient and make their own decisions. Barriers to this include defining who is a self-sufficient individual with a disability, circling back to the concept of self-determination.
