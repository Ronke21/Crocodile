<text>Grant Robert Gee (born November 1964) is a British film maker, photographer and cinematographer. He is most noted for his 1998 documentary &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; about the British alternative rock group Radiohead.

==Early life==
Grant Robert Gee was born in November 1964 in Plymouth, Devon and studied Geography at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford. He did postgraduate study at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

==Career==
In the early 1990s Gee worked on U2&#x27;s Zoo TV and Zoo Radio, and collaborated with Mark Neale on several projects (many through London production company Kudos Productions), including &quot;The Memory Palace&quot;, an experimental multi-media project combining film and live performance for the Expo &#x27;92.

In 1996 he directed a twenty-seven-minute short film commissioned by progressive house band Spooky for parts of their album &quot;Found Sound&quot; (namely the tracks &quot;Central Heating&quot;, &quot;Bamboo&quot;, &quot;Aphonia&quot;, &quot;Lowest Common Denominator&quot;, &quot;Hypo-Allergenic&quot;/&quot;Interim&quot;). The film was displayed on a continuous loop outside the Centre Georges Pompidou as part of its re-opening.

Gee followed the band Radiohead whilst they were on tour for their highly acclaimed 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Gee&#x27;s 1998 documentary of the tour, &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Long Form Music Video.

His short films including &quot;Tel Aviv City Symphony&quot; (commissioned by onedotzero), the documentary &quot;JC-03&quot; (about John Cale at work) and the dance film &quot;Torsion&quot; (choreographed by Russell Maliphant) have been shown internationally as part of touring packages by the British Council, onedotzero and Film and Video Umbrella. Gee has also made music videos for British bands including Radiohead and Blur.

In April 2006 the Creative Commons-licensed film project A Swarm of Angels announced that Gee has joined the project team as Director of Photography. In 2007, he made &quot;Western Lands&quot;, a ten-minute film about climbing the Old Man of Hoy. In November 2010 Grant received funding from the UK Film Council to develop the project &quot;New Career in a New Town: David Bowie in Berlin&quot;, a music documentary on David Bowie&#x27;s Berlin period.

Gee&#x27;s 2007 documentary, &quot;Joy Division&quot;, told the story of the eponymous Manchester band and was made in collaboration with writer Jon Savage. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Robert Koehler wrote that the documentary was &quot;emotionally deeper&quot; than the biopic directed by Anton Corbijn, &quot;Control&quot;.

In January 2011, Gee completed his film &quot;Patience: After Sebald&quot; based on Sebald&#x27;s book &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot;, which was accepted by the Vancouver International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip French called it a &quot;modest, immensely enjoyable documentary&quot;.

In 2015, Gee&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Innocence of Memories&quot;, made in collaboration with Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk and based on his novel &quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;, was screened as a special event in the Venice Days section at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.

<doc id="437956" wikidata="Q22699" url="?curid=437956" title="Sweet chestnut">
<text>The sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), also known as the Spanish chestnut or just chestnut, is a species of tree in the family Fagaceae, native to Southern Europe and Asia Minor, and widely cultivated throughout the temperate world. A substantial, long-lived deciduous tree, it produces an edible seed, the chestnut, which has been used in cooking since ancient times.

== Description ==
&quot;Castanea sativa&quot; attains a height of with a trunk often in diameter. Around 20 trees are recorded with diameters over including one in diameter at breast height. A famous ancient tree known as the Hundred Horse Chestnut in Sicily was historically recorded at in diameter (although it has split into multiple trunks above ground). The bark often has a net-shaped (retiform) pattern with deep furrows or fissures running spirally in both directions up the trunk. The trunk is mostly straight with branching starting at low heights. The oblong-lanceolate, boldly toothed leaves are long and broad.

The flowers of both sexes are borne in long, upright catkins, the male flowers in the upper part and female flowers in the lower part. In the Northern Hemisphere, they appear in late June to July, and by autumn, the female flowers develop into spiny cupules containing 3–7 brownish nuts that are shed during October. The female flowers eventually form a spiky sheath that deters predators from the seed. The sweet chestnut is naturally self incompatible, meaning that the plant cannot pollinate itself, making cross-pollination necessary. Some cultivars only produce one large seed per cupule, while others produce up to three seeds. The nut itself is composed of two skins: an external, shiny brown part, and an internal skin adhering to the fruit. Inside, there is an edible, creamy-white part developed from the cotyledons.

Sweet chestnut trees live to an age of 500 to 600 years. In cultivation they may even grow as old as 1,000 years or more.

== Taxonomy ==
The tree is to be distinguished from the horse chestnut &quot;Aesculus hippocastanum&quot;, to which it is only distantly related. The horse chestnut bears similar looking seeds (conkers) in a similar seed case, which are not palatable to humans. Other common names include &quot;Spanish chestnut&quot; or &quot;marron&quot; (French for &quot;chestnut&quot;). The generic name &quot;Castanea&quot; is the old Latin name for the plant species, while the specific epithet &quot;sativa&quot; means &quot;cultivated by humans&quot;. Some selected varieties are smaller and more compact in growth yielding earlier in life with different ripening time: the Marigoule, the Marisol and the Maraval.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to Southern Europe and Asia Minor. It is found across the Mediterranean region, from the Caspian Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought to have survived the last ice age in several refuges in Southern Europe, on the southern coast of the Black Sea with a main centre on the southern slope of the Caucasus and in the region of north-western Syria, possibly extending into Lebanon.

The species is widely distributed throughout Europe, where in 2004 &quot;Castanea sativa&quot; was grown on of forest, of which were mainly cultivated for wood and for fruit production. In some European countries, &quot;C. sativa&quot; has only been introduced recently, for example in Slovakia or the Netherlands.

The tree requires a mild climate and adequate moisture for good growth and a good nut harvest. Its year-growth (but not the rest of the tree) is sensitive to late spring and early autumn frosts; it is also intolerant of lime. Under forest conditions, it will tolerate moderate shade well. It can live to more than 2,000 years of age in natural conditions, such as the Hundred Horse Chestnut near Mount Etna in eastern Sicily.

== Ecology ==

The leaves provide food for some animals, including Lepidoptera such as the case-bearer moth &quot;Coleophora anatipennella&quot; and North American rose chafer &quot;Macrodactylus subspinosus&quot;.

The two major fungal pathogens of the sweet chestnut are the chestnut blight (&quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot;) and the ink disease caused by &quot;Phytophthora cambivora&quot; and &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot;. In North America as well as in Southern Europe &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot; destroyed most of the chestnut population in the 20th century. With biological control, the population of the sweet chestnut is not threatened anymore by the chestnut blight and is regenerating. Ink disease is infesting trees mostly in humid soils, with the mycelium invading the root and resulting in wilting of the leaf. Absence of fruit formation leads to die back of the petal. The ink disease is named after the black exudates at the base of the trunk. Nowadays there are cultivars that are resistant to the ink disease. &quot;Phytophthora cambivora&quot; caused serious damage in Asia and the US, and it still continues to destroy new plantations in Europe.

Another serious pest which is difficult to control is the gall wasp (&quot;Dryocosmus kuriphylus&quot;) which was recently introduced in Southern Europe, originating in Asia.

== Cultivation ==

=== History ===
Pollen data indicates that the first spreading of &quot;Castanea sativa&quot; due to human activity started around 2100–2050 B.C. in Anatolia, northeastern Greece and southeastern Bulgaria. Compared to other crops, the sweet chestnut was probably of relatively minor importance and distributed very heterogeneously throughout these regions. The first charcoal remains of sweet chestnut only date from around 850–950 B.C., making it very difficult to infer a precise origin history. A newer but more reliable source are the literary works of Ancient Greece, with the richest being Theophrastus&#x27;s &quot;Historia plantarum&quot;, written in the third century B.C. Theophrastus focuses mainly on the use of sweet chestnut wood as timber and charcoal, only mentioning the use of the fruit once when commenting on the digestive difficulties it causes, but praising its nourishing quality. Several Greek authors wrote about medicinal properties of the sweet chestnut, specifically as a remedy against lacerations of the lips and of the oesophagus.

Similar to the introduction of grape vine and olive cultivation to the Latin world, &quot;C. sativa&quot; is thought to have been introduced during the colonisation of the Italian peninsula by the Greeks. Further clues pointing to this theory can be found in the work of Pliny the Elder, who mentions only Greek colonies in connection with sweet chestnut cultivation. Today&#x27;s phylogenetic map of the sweet chestnut, while not fully understood, shows greater genetic similarity between Italian and western Anatolian &quot;C. sativa&quot; trees compared to eastern Anatolian specimen, reinforcing these findings. Nonetheless, until the end of the pre-Christian era, the spread and use of the chestnut in Italy remained limited. Carbonised sweet chestnuts were found in a Roman villa at Torre Annunziata near Naples, destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79.

Clues in art and literature indicate a dislike of the sweet chestnut by the Roman aristocracy. Like Theophrastus, Latin authors are sceptical of the sweet chestnut as a fruit, and Pliny the Elder even goes as far as admiring how well nature has hidden this fruit of apparently so little value. In the beginning of the Christian era, people probably started to realize the value and versatility of sweet chestnut wood, leading to a slow spread of the cultivation of &quot;C. sativa&quot; trees, a theory that is supported by pollen data and literary sources, as well as the increased use of sweet chestnut wood as poles and in supporting structures, wood works and pier building between A.D. 100 and 600.

Increasing sweet chestnut pollen appearances in Switzerland, France, Germany and the Iberian peninsula in the first century A.D. suggests the spreading of cultivated sweet chestnut trees by the Romans. Contrary to that notion, other scientists found no indication of the Romans spreading &quot;C. sativa&quot; before the fifth century. While the husks of sweet chestnuts, dated to the third or early fourth century, have been identified from the bottom of a Roman well at Great Holts Farm, in Boreham in Essex, England; this deposit includes remains of other exotic food plants and provides no evidence that any of them originated locally. No other evidence of sweet chestnut in Roman Britain has been confirmed. Indeed, no centre of sweet chestnut cultivation outside the Italian peninsula in Roman times has been detected. Widespread use of chestnut in western Europe started in the early Middle Ages and flourished in the late Middle Ages. In the mid-seventh-century Lombard laws, a composition of one solidi is set for felling a chestnut tree (or, also, hazel, pear or apple) belonging to another person (&quot;Edictum Rothari&quot;, No. 301, 643 AD). Since the beginning of the 20th century, due to depopulation of the countryside and the abandonment of the sweet chestnut as a staple food as well as the spread of chestnut blight and ink disease, &quot;C. sativa&quot; cultivation has dramatically decreased. Nowadays, sweet chestnut production is sometimes seen at a turning point again, because the development of high-value sweet chestnut products combined with changing needs of an urban society is leading to a revival in &quot;C. sativa&quot; cultivation.

=== Cultivation forms ===

Three different cultivation systems for the sweet chestnut can be distinguished:
* &quot;Coppicing&quot;: Mainly for wood extraction. Standard conditions yield 15 m3 wood per ha per year.
* &quot;Selve&quot;: Fruit production from grafted trees. The trees have a short tribe and a big crown. Trees have a high density and the ground between the trees is often used as pasture.
* &quot;High forest:&quot; Wood and fruit production. This cultivation form is less intensive with a yield of 4–12 dt/ha and replacement of trees every 50–80 years. The trees grow from seeds and build a dense canopy.

The field management is dependent on the cultivation system. While cleaning the soil from the leaves and pruning is the norm, the use of fertilizer, irrigation and pesticides is less common and reserved for more intensive cultivation.

=== Requirements ===
The sweet chestnut tree grows well on limestone-free, deeply weathered soil. The optimal pH value of the soil is between 4.5 and 6, and the tree cannot tolerate soil compaction. The tolerance to wet ground and to clay-rich soils is very low. It is a heat-loving tree which needs a long vegetation period. The optimal average temperature is between and in January the temperature should preferably not be below but it may tolerate temperatures as low as . Low temperature in autumn can damage the fruit. The maximal altitude is strongly dependent on the climate. In general, the climate should be similar to viticulture. Optimal precipitation is between . Before planting, seeds must be stratified at so germination can start 30–40 days later. After a year, the young trees are transplanted.

=== Harvest ===

A tree grown from seed may take 20 years or more before it bears fruits, but a grafted cultivar such as &#x27;Marron de Lyon&#x27; or &#x27;Paragon&#x27; may start production within five years of being planted. Both cultivars bear fruits with a single large kernel, rather than the usual two to four smaller kernels.

The fruit yield per tree is usually between , but can get as high as . Harvest time is between middle of September and middle of November. There are three harvesting techniques:
* By hand: The sweet chestnuts are harvested by rake or broom, with a harvest speed of every hour depending on the soil relief. Also, the capsule makes the harvest more complicated and even painful for the worker.
* By hand with nets: This technique is less time-consuming and protects the fruits from injuries. However, setting up the nets is labor intensive.
* Mechanical: The fruits are collected with a machine that works similarly to a vacuum cleaner. Doing so is time-saving and economical, but it is possible that some fruits get injured, and an investment is needed. Furthermore, visual sorting is not possible.

=== Post-harvest treatment ===
The most widespread treatment before storage is water curing, a process in which the sweet chestnuts are immersed in water for nine days. The aim of this practice is to limit the main storage problems threatening the sweet chestnut: fungi development and the presence of insect worms. As an alternative to water curing, hot water treatment is also commercially used.

After water treatment, the sweet chestnuts are stored in a controlled environment with high carbon dioxide concentrations. In contrast to a cold storage system, where the fruits are stored at low temperatures in untreated air, the controlled environment method avoids flesh hardening which negatively impacts the processability of the product.

=== Cultivars ===
The ornamental cultivar &quot;Castanea sativa&quot; &#x27;Albomarginata&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==

The species is widely cultivated for its edible seeds (also called nuts) and for its wood.

Sweet chestnut has been listed as one of the 38 substances used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its supposed effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, &quot;there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer&quot;.

=== Food ===
The species&#x27; large genetic diversity and different cultivars are exploited for uses such as flour, boiling, roasting, drying, and sweets.

The raw nuts, though edible, have a skin which is astringent and unpleasant to eat when still moist; after drying for a time the thin skin loses its astringency but is still better removed to reach the white fruit underneath. Cooking dry in an oven or fire normally helps remove this skin. Chestnuts are traditionally roasted in their tough brown husks after removing the spiny cupules in which they grow on the tree, the husks being peeled off and discarded and the hot chestnuts dipped in salt before eating them. Roast chestnuts are traditionally sold in streets, markets and fairs by street vendors with mobile or static braziers.

The skin of raw peeled chestnuts can be relatively easily removed by quickly blanching the nuts after scoring them by a cross slit at the tufted end. Once cooked, chestnuts acquire a sweet flavor and a floury texture similar to the sweet potato. The cooked nuts can be used for stuffing poultry, as a vegetable or in nut roasts. They can also be used in confections, puddings, desserts and cakes. They are used for flour, bread making, a cereal substitute, coffee substitute, a thickener in soups and other cookery uses, as well as for fattening stock. A sugar can be extracted from them. The Corsican variety of polenta (called &quot;pulenta&quot;) is made with sweet chestnut flour. A local variety of Corsican beer also uses chestnuts. The product is sold as a sweetened paste mixed with vanilla, , sweetened or unsweetened as chestnut purée or &quot;purée de marron&quot;, and candied chestnuts as &quot;marrons glacés&quot;. In Switzerland, it is often served as &quot;Vermicelles&quot;.

Roman soldiers were given chestnut porridge before going into battle.

Leaf infusions are used in respiratory diseases and are a popular remedy for whooping cough. A hair shampoo can be made from infusing leaves and fruit husks.

==== Nutritional constituents ====
The fat content is low and dominated by unsaturated fatty acids. Sweet chestnut is a good source of starch. The energy value per 100 g (3.5 oz) of &quot;C. sativa&quot; amounts to 891 kJ (213 kcal) (table). &quot;C. sativa&quot; is characterized by high moisture content which ranges from 41% to 59%. The chestnut provides a good source of copper, phosphorus, manganese and potassium (nutrition table). Its sugar content ranges from 14% to 20% dry weight, depending on the cultivar. Fructose is mostly responsible for the sweet taste.

==== Effect of processing ====
Sweet chestnut is suited for human nutrition. Most sweet chestnut is consumed in processed form, which has an impact on the nutrient composition. Its naturally high concentration of organic acids is a key factor influencing the organoleptic characteristics of fruits and vegetables, namely flavor. Organic acids are thought to play an important role against diseases as an antioxidant. Heat appears to be the most influencing factor when it comes to decreasing the organic acid content. However, even after heating sweet chestnuts, antioxidant activity remains relatively high. On the other hand, the consumer must consider that roasting, boiling or frying has a big impact on the nutritional profile of chestnut. Vitamin C significantly decreases between 25 and 54% when boiled and 2–77 % when roasted. Nevertheless, roasted or boiled chestnuts may still be a solid vitamin C source, since 100 grams still represent about 20% of the recommended daily dietary intake.

The sugar content is also affected by the high temperatures. Four processes are decisive for the degrading process of sugar while cooking: hydrolysis of starch to oligosaccharide and monosaccharide, decomposition of sucrose to glucose and fructose, caramelization of sugars and degradation of sugars. Organic acids are also affected by high temperatures: their content decreases about 50% after frying, and 15% after boiling. Responsible for the aromatic characteristics of cooked chestnuts is the effect of degradation of saccharides, proteins and lipids, the caramelization of saccharides and the maillard reaction that is reducing sugar and amino acids.

=== Wood ===
This tree responds very well to coppicing, which is still practised in Britain, and produces a good crop of tannin-rich wood every 12 to 30 years, depending on intended use and local growth rate. The tannin renders the young growing wood durable and weather resistant for outdoor use, thus suitable for posts, fencing or stakes. The wood is of light colour, hard and strong. It is used to make furniture, barrels (sometimes used to age balsamic vinegar), and roof beams notably in southern Europe (for example in houses of the Alpujarra, Spain, in southern France and elsewhere). The timber has a density of 560 kg per cubic meter, and due to its durability in ground contact is often used for external purposes such as fencing. It is also a good fuel, though not favoured for open fires as it tends to spit.

Tannin is found in the following proportions on a 10% moisture basis: bark (6.8%), wood (13.4%), seed husks (10–13%). The leaves also contain tannin.

<doc id="437961" wikidata="Q41317" url="?curid=437961" title="Electric ray">
<text>The electric rays are a group of rays, flattened cartilaginous fish with enlarged pectoral fins, composing the order Torpediniformes . They are known for being capable of producing an electric discharge, ranging from 8 to 220 volts, depending on species, used to stun prey and for defense. There are 69 species in four families.

Perhaps the best known members are those of the genus &quot;Torpedo&quot;. The torpedo undersea weapon is named after it. The name comes from the Latin , &#x27;to be stiffened or paralyzed&#x27;, from the effect on someone who touches the fish.

==Description==

Electric rays have a rounded pectoral disc with two moderately large rounded-angular (not pointed or hooked) dorsal fins (reduced in some Narcinidae), and a stout muscular tail with a well-developed caudal fin. The body is thick and flabby, with soft loose skin with no dermal denticles or thorns. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are at the base of the pectoral fins. The snout is broad, large in the Narcinidae, but reduced in all other families. The mouth, nostrils, and five pairs of gill slits are underneath the disc.

Electric rays are found from shallow coastal waters down to at least deep. They are sluggish and slow-moving, propelling themselves with their tails, not by using their pectoral fins as other rays do. They feed on invertebrates and small fish. They lie in wait for prey below the sand or other substrate, using their electricity to stun and capture it.

==Relationship to humans==

=== History of research ===

The electrogenic properties of electric rays have been known since antiquity, although their nature was not understood. The ancient Greeks used electric rays to numb the pain of childbirth and operations. In his dialogue &quot;Meno&quot;, Plato has the character Meno accuse Socrates of &quot;stunning&quot; people with his puzzling questions, in a manner similar to the way the torpedo fish stuns with electricity. Scribonius Largus, a Roman physician, recorded the use of torpedo fish for treatment of headaches and gout in his &quot;Compositiones Medicae&quot; of 46 AD.

In the 1770s the electric organs of the torpedo ray were the subject of Royal Society papers by John Walsh, and John Hunter. These appear to have influenced the thinking of Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta – the founders of electrophysiology and electrochemistry.
Henry Cavendish proposed that electric rays use electricity; he built an artificial ray consisting of fish shaped Leyden jars to successfully mimic their behaviour in 1773.

=== In folklore ===

The torpedo fish, or electric ray, appears continuously in premodern natural histories as a magical creature, and its ability to numb fishermen without seeming to touch them was a significant source of evidence for the belief in occult qualities in nature during the ages before the discovery of electricity as an explanatory mode.

==Bioelectricity==

The electric rays have specialised electric organs. Many species of rays and skates outside the family have electric organs in the tail; however, the electric ray has two large kidney-shaped electric organs on each side of its head, where current passes from the lower to the upper surface of the body. The nerves that signal the organ to discharge branch repeatedly, then attach to the lower side of each plaque in the batteries. These are composed of hexagonal columns, closely packed in a honeycomb formation. Each column consists of 500 to more than 1000 plaques of modified striated muscle, adapted from the branchial (gill arch) muscles. In marine fish, these batteries are connected as a parallel circuit, whereas freshwater batteries are arranged in series. This allows freshwater rays to transmit discharges of higher voltage, as freshwater cannot conduct electricity as well as saltwater. With such a battery, an electric ray may electrocute larger prey with a voltage of between 8 volts in some narcinids to 220 volts in &quot;Torpedo nobiliana&quot;, the Atlantic torpedo.

==Systematics==
The 60 or so species of electric rays are grouped into 12 genera and two families. The Narkinae are sometimes elevated to a family, the Narkidae. The torpedinids feed on large prey, which are stunned using their electric organs and swallowed whole, while the narcinids specialize on small prey on or in the bottom substrate. Both groups use electricity for defense, but it is unclear whether the narcinids use electricity in feeding.

&quot;Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes&quot; lists classifies the following families in the Torpediniformes:

* Family Platyrhinidae (thornbacks or fanrays)
* Family Narkidae Fowler, 1934 (sleeper rays)
* Family Narcinidae (electric rays)
* Family Hypnidae (coffin rays)
* Family Torpedinidae (torpedo electric rays or torpedo rays)

<text>The Zone diet is a fad diet emphasizing low-carbohydrate consumption. It was created by Barry Sears, an American biochemist.

The ideas behind the diet are not supported by scientific evidence.

== Approach ==
The diet is meant to promote weight loss via reduction in calories consumed and avoid spikes in insulin release, thus supporting the maintenance of insulin sensitivity. It begins with the determination of the individual&#x27;s protein requirement for daily replacement due to various loss mechanisms.

The Zone diet proposes that a relatively narrow distribution in the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates, centered at 0.75, is essential to &quot;balance the insulin to glucagon ratio, which purportedly affects eicosanoid metabolism and ultimately produces a cascade of biological events leading to a reduction in chronic disease risk, enhanced immunity, maximal physical and mental performance, increased longevity and permanent weight loss.&quot;

The diet advocates eating five times a day, with 3 meals and 2 snacks, and includes eating proteins, carbohydrates – those with a lower glycemic index are considered more favorable, and fats (monounsaturated fats are considered healthier) in a caloric ratio of 30%-40%-30% (fat-carb-pro). The hand is used as the mnemonic tool; five fingers for five times a day, with no more than five hours between meals. The size and thickness of the palm are used to measure protein while two big fists measure favorable carbohydrates and one fist unfavorable carbohydrates. There is a more complex scheme of &quot;Zone blocks&quot; and &quot;mini-blocks&quot; that followers of the diet can use to determine the ratios of macronutrients consumed. Daily exercise is encouraged.

The diet falls about midway in the continuum between the USDA-recommended food pyramid which advocates eating grains, vegetables, and fruit and reducing fat, and the high-fat Atkins Diet.

== Effectiveness ==
Like other low-carb diets, the ideas underlying the Zone diet are unproven.

As of 2013, there were &quot;no cross-sectional or longitudinal studies examining the potential health merit of adopting a Zone Diet per se, [and] closely related peer-reviewed findings from scientific research cast strong doubt over the purported benefits of this diet. When properly evaluated, the ideas and arguments of popular low carbohydrate diet books like the Zone rely on poorly controlled, non-peer-reviewed studies, anecdotes and non-science rhetoric.&quot;

<doc id="437979" wikidata="Q1645406" url="?curid=437979" title="Midpoint">
<text>In geometry, the midpoint is the middle point of a line segment. It is equidistant from both endpoints, and it is the centroid both of the segment and of the endpoints. It bisects the segment.

==Formula==

The midpoint of a segment in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space whose endpoints are formula_1 and formula_2 is given by

:formula_3

That is, the &quot;i&quot;th coordinate of the midpoint (&quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;) is

:formula_4

==Construction==
Given two points of interest, finding the midpoint of the line segment they determine can be accomplished by a compass and straightedge construction. The midpoint of a line segment, embedded in a plane, can be located by first constructing a lens using circular arcs of equal (and large enough) radii centered at the two endpoints, then connecting the cusps of the lens (the two points where the arcs intersect). The point where the line connecting the cusps intersects the segment is then the midpoint of the segment. It is more challenging to locate the midpoint using only a compass, but it is still possible according to the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem.

==Geometric properties involving midpoints==
===Circle===

* The midpoint of any diameter of a circle is the center of the circle.

*Any line perpendicular to any chord of a circle and passing through its midpoint also passes through the circle&#x27;s center.

*The butterfly theorem states that, if is the midpoint of a chord of a circle, through which two other chords and are drawn; and intersect chord at and correspondingly, then is the midpoint of .

===Ellipse===

*The midpoint of any segment which is an area bisector or perimeter bisector of an ellipse is the ellipse&#x27;s center.

*The ellipse&#x27;s center is also the midpoint of a segment connecting the two foci of the ellipse.

===Hyperbola===

*The midpoint of a segment connecting a hyperbola&#x27;s vertices is the center of the hyperbola.

===Triangle===

*The perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the line that is perpendicular to that side and passes through its midpoint. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle&#x27;s three sides intersect at the circumcenter (the center of the circle through the three vertices). 

*The median of a triangle&#x27;s side passes through both the side&#x27;s midpoint and the triangle&#x27;s opposite vertex. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the triangle&#x27;s centroid (the point on which the triangle would balance if it were made of a thin sheet of uniform-density metal).

*The nine-point center of a triangle lies at the midpoint between the circumcenter and the orthocenter. These points are all on the Euler line.

*A &quot;midsegment&quot; (or &quot;midline&quot;) of a triangle is a line segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. It is parallel to the third side and has a length equal to one half of that third side.

*The medial triangle of a given triangle has vertices at the midpoints of the given triangle&#x27;s sides, therefore its sides are the three midsegments of the given triangle. It shares the same centroid and medians with the given triangle. The perimeter of the medial triangle equals the semiperimeter (half the perimeter) of the original triangle, and its area is one quarter of the area of the original triangle. The orthocenter (intersection of the altitudes) of the medial triangle coincides with the circumcenter (center of the circle through the vertices) of the original triangle.

*Every triangle has an inscribed ellipse, called its Steiner inellipse, that is internally tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of all its sides. This ellipse is centered at the triangle&#x27;s centroid, and it has the largest area of any ellipse inscribed in the triangle.

*In a right triangle, the circumcenter is the midpoint of the hypotenuse.

*In an isosceles triangle, the median, altitude, and perpendicular bisector from the base side and the angle bisector of the apex coincide with the Euler line and the axis of symmetry, and these coinciding lines go through the midpoint of the base side.

===Quadrilateral===

*The two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent at (all intersect at)a point called the &quot;vertex centroid&quot;, which is the midpoint of all three of these segments.

*The four &quot;maltitudes&quot; of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter side. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes all meet at a common point called the &quot;anticenter&quot;.

*Brahmagupta&#x27;s theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal (that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always goes through the midpoint of the opposite side.

*Varignon&#x27;s theorem states that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form the vertices of a parallelogram, and if the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting then the area of the parallelogram is half the area of the quadrilateral.

*The Newton line is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals in a convex quadrilateral that is not a parallelogram. The line segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral intersect in a point that lies on the Newton line.

===General polygons===

*A regular polygon has an inscribed circle which is tangent to each side of the polygon at its midpoint.

*In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the midpoint of a diagonal between opposite vertices is the polygon&#x27;s center.

*The midpoint-stretching polygon of a cyclic polygon (a polygon whose vertices all fall on the same circle) is another cyclic polygon inscribed in the same circle, the polygon whose vertices are the midpoints of the circular arcs between the vertices of . Iterating the midpoint-stretching operation on an arbitrary initial polygon results in a sequence of polygons whose shapes converge to that of a regular polygon.

==Generalizations==

The abovementioned formulas for the midpoint of a segment implicitly use the lengths of segments. However, in the generalization to affine geometry, where segment lengths are not defined, the midpoint can still be defined since it is an affine invariant. The synthetic affine definition of the midpoint of a segment is the projective harmonic conjugate of the point at infinity, , of the line . That is, the point such that . When coordinates can be introduced in an affine geometry, the two definitions of midpoint will coincide.

The midpoint is not naturally defined in projective geometry since there is no distinguished point to play the role of the point at infinity (any point in a projective range may be projectively mapped to any other point in (the same or some other) projective range). However, fixing a point at infinity defines an affine structure on the projective line in question and the above definition can be applied. 

The definition of the midpoint of a segment may be extended to curve segments, such as geodesic arcs on a Riemannian manifold. Note that, unlike in the affine case, the &quot;midpoint&quot; between two points may not be uniquely determined.

<doc id="437988" wikidata="Q1617362" url="?curid=437988" title="Sachs–Wolfe effect">
<text>The Sachs–Wolfe effect, named after Rainer K. Sachs and Arthur M. Wolfe, is a property of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), in which photons from the CMB are gravitationally redshifted, causing the CMB spectrum to appear uneven. This effect is the predominant source of fluctuations in the CMB for angular scales larger than about ten degrees.

== Non-integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect ==

The non-integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect is caused by gravitational redshift occurring at the surface of last scattering. The effect is not constant across the sky due to differences in the matter/energy density at the time of last scattering.

== Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect ==

The integrated Sachs–Wolfe (ISW) effect is also caused by gravitational redshift, but it occurs between the surface of last scattering and the Earth, so it is not part of the primordial CMB. It occurs when the Universe is dominated in its energy density by something other than matter. If the Universe is dominated by matter, then large-scale gravitational potential energy wells and hills do not evolve significantly. If the Universe is dominated by radiation, or by dark energy, though, those potentials do evolve, subtly changing the energy of photons passing through them.

There are two contributions to the ISW effect. The &quot;early-time&quot; ISW occurs immediately after the (non-integrated) Sachs–Wolfe effect produces the primordial CMB, as photons course through density fluctuations while there is still enough radiation around to affect the Universe&#x27;s expansion. Although it is physically the same as the late-time ISW, for observational purposes it is usually lumped in with the primordial CMB, since the matter fluctuations that cause it are in practice undetectable.

=== Late-time integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect ===

The &quot;late-time&quot; ISW effect arises quite recently in cosmic history, as dark energy, or the cosmological constant, starts to govern the Universe&#x27;s expansion. Unfortunately, the nomenclature is a bit confusing. Often, &quot;late-time ISW&quot; implicitly refers to the late-time ISW effect to linear/first order in density perturbations. This linear part of the effect entirely vanishes in a flat universe with only matter, but dominates over the higher-order part of the effect in a universe with dark energy. The full nonlinear (linear + higher-order) late-time ISW effect, especially in the case of individual voids and clusters, is sometimes known as the Rees–Sciama effect, since Martin Rees and Dennis Sciama elucidated the following physical picture.

Accelerated expansion due to dark energy causes even strong large-scale potential wells (superclusters) and hills (voids) to decay over the time it takes a photon to travel through them. A photon gets a kick of energy going into a potential well (a supercluster), and it keeps some of that energy after it exits, after the well has been stretched out and shallowed. Similarly, a photon has to expend energy entering a supervoid, but will not get all of it back upon exiting the slightly reduced potential hill.

A signature of the late-time ISW is a non-zero cross-correlation function between the galaxy density (the number of galaxies per square degree) and the temperature of the CMB, because superclusters gently heat photons, while supervoids gently cool them. This correlation has been detected at moderate to high significance.

In May 2008, Granett, Neyrinck &amp; Szapudi showed that the late-time ISW can be pinned to discrete supervoids and superclusters identified in the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy catalog. Their ISW detection traces the localised ISW effect produced by supervoids and superclusters have on the CMB. However, the amplitude of this localised detection is controversial, as it is significantly larger than the expectations and depends on several assumptions of the analysis.

<doc id="437990" wikidata="Q2993394" url="?curid=437990" title="Conkers">
<text>Conkers is a traditional children&#x27;s game in Great Britain and Ireland played using the seeds of horse chestnut trees—the name &#x27;conker&#x27; is also applied to the seed and to the tree itself. The game is played by two players, each with a conker threaded onto a piece of string: they take turns striking each other&#x27;s conker until one breaks.

==Origin==

The first mention of the game is in Robert Southey&#x27;s memoirs published in 1821. He describes a similar game, but played with snail shells or hazelnuts. It was only from the 1850s that using horse chestnuts was regularly referred to in certain regions.

There is uncertainty of the origins of the name. The name may come from the dialect word &quot;conker&quot;, meaning &quot;knock out&quot; (perhaps related to French &quot;conque&quot; meaning a conch, as the game was originally played using snail shells and small bits of string). The name may also be influenced by the verb &quot;conquer&quot;, as earlier games involving shells and hazelnuts have also been called &quot;conquerors&quot;. Compton MacKenzie&#x27;s 1913 novel Sinister Street uses the name Conquerors.

Another possibility is that it is an onomatopoeia, representing the sound made by a horse chestnut as it hits another hard object, such as a skull (another children&#x27;s &quot;game&quot;, also called conkers, consists of simply throwing the seeds at one another over a fence or wall). Conkers are also known regionally as &quot;cheesers&quot;, a &quot;cheeser&quot; being a conker with one or more flat sides, which comes about due to it sharing its pod with other conkers (twins or triplets). Also &quot;Cheggers&quot; was used in Lancaster, England in the 1920s. In D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s book &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, the game is referred to as &quot;cobblers&quot; by William Morel.

==History==

===England===
The first recorded game of conkers using horse chestnuts was on the Isle of Wight in 1848. The game grew in popularity in the 19th century, and spread beyond England.

===United States===

Conkers was played during the late 1940s and early 1950s in New York in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, and in the 1950s and early 1960s in the amalgamated section of the Bronx and nearby Mt.Vernon. It was also played in Queens, the upper West Side of Manhattan, in the Mohawk Valley area of upstate New York and in Westmount, Quebec and other English-speaking parts of Montreal into the 1970s. It was played in the Catholic areas of North Cambridge, MA in the late 1950s. It was being played in the 1960s in Rhode Island, and into the early 1980s in Smithfield, RI.

The game was also played in Leicester, Massachusetts in the late 1970s and into the 1980s (and presumably much earlier, given the town&#x27;s age and predominantly English/Irish settlers) by the children of the Primary School of the town (typically 4th and 5th graders). Leicester&#x27;s seat of government (&quot;town hall&quot;) was a dual use building, serving as both town hall and school. There is a large horse chestnut tree located on the town&#x27;s common (and adjacent to town hall) that was used as a source for the chestnuts. The Leicester variant on the name for the game was &quot;Horse Cobblers&quot;(presumably a variant of &quot;Horse Conkers&quot;).

==Game==
Before the game, each player must prepare a conker. A hole is bored in a large, hard conker using a nail, gimlet, small screwdriver, or electric drill. A piece of string (often a shoelace is used), about long, is threaded through it. A large knot at one or both ends of the string secures the conker.

===Play===

The game is played between two people, each with a conker. They take turns hitting each other&#x27;s conker using their own. One player lets the conker dangle on the full length of the string and the other player swings their conker to hit it.

A point is scored for a conker surviving a hit that causes the other one to break. The point is scored irrespective of whether the surviving conker was attacking or defending at the time.

The scoring of the game is considered to be a property of the conkers themselves. A new conker is a &quot;none-er&quot;, meaning that it has not defeated any others yet and thus has no score. As a conker accumulates points, its designation changes to reflect the total: a &quot;none-er&quot; becomes a &quot;one-er&quot;, then a &quot;two-er&quot;, and so on. (In some areas of Scotland, conker victories are counted using the terms &quot;bully-one&quot;, &quot;bully-two&quot;, etc. In some areas of the United States and Canada, conker victories are counted using the terms &quot;one-kinger&quot;, &quot;two-kinger&quot;, etc. In 1940s Brooklyn, New York, a winning chestnut was referred to as a &quot;killer&quot; and the value of a chestnut was defined by its number of &quot;kills&quot;.)

In some regions, the winning conker receives all the points accumulated by the losing one, in addition to gaining one more point for the defeat. For example, a &quot;two-er&quot; that defeats a &quot;three-er&quot; would become a &quot;six-er&quot; (2 + 3 + 1). Other regions only award one point to the winner, regardless of the loser&#x27;s score.

===Variant rules===
* If the strings become entangled, the first player to shout &quot;strings&quot; or &quot;stringsies&quot; has an extra turn.
* If one player drops their conker, the other can shout &quot;stamps&quot; or &quot;stampsies&quot; entitling them to try and break the conker on the ground by stamping on it. Shouting &quot;no stamps&quot; before the other player can shout &quot;stamps&quot; prevents any stamping.

===Hardening conkers===

The hardest conkers usually win. Hardening conkers is often done by keeping them for a year (aged conkers are called &quot;laggies&quot; in many areas or &quot;seasoners&quot; in Ireland and Liverpool), baking them briefly, soaking or boiling in vinegar, or painting with clear nail varnish. Such hardening is, however, usually regarded as cheating.

At the British Junior Conkers Championships on the Isle of Wight in October 2005, contestants were banned from bringing their own conkers out of fears that they might harden them. The Campaign for Real Conkers claimed this was an example of over-regulation which was causing a drop in interest in the game. In both the World Conker Championship and the North American Championship, contestants are also restricted to using the conkers provided by the organisers.

One factor affecting the strength of a conker is the shape of the hole. A clean cylindrical hole is stronger, as it has no notches or chips that can begin a crack or split.

The Peckham Conker Championships allow artificially hardened conkers, with some players even coating their conkers in epoxy resin. This competition follows Battle Royale rules and also allows stampsies and stringies.

===Similar game===

A similar Puerto Rican game (played with the smaller seed of the jatobá, &quot;Hymenaea courbaril&quot;) is called &quot;gallitos&quot; (meaning small roosters or cocks, as in cockfighting). The opponents face each other and the defending gallito is laid in the center of a circle drawn in the dirt. Not until the attacking player misses will the defending player take a turn. Upon missing, if the attacking player is quick enough, they will try to swing at the defending gallito before the defendant removes it from within the circle. If the defending gallito is struck it must remain in the circle until the attacker misses again. This move is called a &quot;paso de paloma&quot;.

==Championships==

In 1965, the World Conker Championships were set up in Ashton (near Oundle) Northamptonshire, England, and still take place on the second Sunday of October every year. In 2004, an audience of 5,000 turned up to watch more than 500 competitors from all over the world. The 2016 Championship was featured on the BBC programme &quot;Countryfile&quot;.

The first time that a non-British contestant won the Men&#x27;s World Conker Championship was in 1976. The Mexican Jorge Ramirez Carrillo took the place of a contestant who was unable to arrive on time at Ashton, and defeated the 1975 champion at the finals. The men&#x27;s champion has been British in every other year except 1998, when Helmut Kern from Nauort, Germany, won.

In 1999, the Irish Conker Championships began in Freshford, County Kilkenny, in Ireland.

Selma Becker, originally from Austria, was the first ladies&#x27; champion from outside the UK, in 2000. The title of Queen of Conkers has remained in the UK, except in 2001 when Frenchwoman Celine Parachou won.

Eamonn Dooley from Freshford in County Kilkenny, Ireland broke the world record in 2000 by smashing 306 conkers in one hour.

In 2004, an alternative World Conker Championships was first hosted at Pill Harriers Rugby Club, Newport, Wales. This championship, known as the World Annual National Conker Championships, has been held every year since and is sanctioned by Dogfish Promotions. Contestants from the United States, Italy, England and Wales have taken part.

The North American Conker Championship was inaugurated on 20 October 2012 at the Historic Gardens in the town of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, Canada, hosted by the Annapolis Royal Conker Club.

The Peckham Conker Championships was first held in October 2017 in Peckham, London, playing a more extreme version of the game with Battle Royale rules which was organised by Peckham Conker Club. In 2023, more than 500 people from different parts of the UK took part in this championship.

At the 2024 World Conker Championship, controversy arose when the winner, veteran competitor David Jakins, dubbed &quot;King Conker&quot;, was accused of cheating. Jakins was alleged to have used a replica conker made from steel. He has been exonerated.

In 2000, a survey of British schools by Keele University showed that many were not allowing children to play conkers, as head teachers were afraid of the legal consequences if children were injured while playing the game, or because they thought that the conkers might be used as weapons. The TV programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; later staged a game of conkers using caravans suspended from cranes. After putting on safety goggles, presenter James May commented &quot;I now feel perfectly happy about being hit in the face by a caravan.&quot; &quot;Top Gear&quot;, along with other media commentators, wrongly stated that the wearing of goggles during the game was due to an official Health and Safety Executive (HSE) edict when it was in fact due to a myth which started when a headmaster bought goggles for children to use as a parody of health and safety regulation and sponsored a conkers tournament.

In 2004, several schools in Britain banned conkers due to fear of causing anaphylactic shock in pupils with nut allergies. Health advisers said that there were no known dangers from conkers for nut-allergy sufferers, although some may experience a mild rash through handling them.

<doc id="438000" wikidata="Q316244" url="?curid=438000" title="Pickert">
<text>A pickert () is a flat, fried or baked potato dish from Westphalia, Germany. It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake. It comes as a round &quot;Pfannenpickert&quot; the size of a pan, a rectangular &quot;Kastenpickert&quot;, or a palm-sized regular &quot;Pickert&quot;. The name is derived from Low German &quot;picken&quot;, &quot;pecken&quot; (&quot;to stick something onto something else&quot;).

The main ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10–15 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4–5 people.

Pickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day&#x27;s work in the fields. They are now served spread with sugar beet syrup, butter or (plum) jam, or leberwurst.

A related dish, &quot;Lappenpickert&quot;, is found in the regions west of Lippe, towards Münster and the Ruhr Area. It does not usually contain raisins and yeast, but may have a dash of sweet cream added. &quot;Lappenpickert&quot; is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a griddle greased with a side of lard, and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe, or with smoked fish or cold cuts.

<doc id="438004" wikidata="Q500096" url="?curid=438004" title="Psychophysics">
<text>Psychophysics quantitatively investigates the relationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce. Psychophysics has been described as &quot;the scientific study of the relation between stimulus and sensation&quot; or, more completely, as &quot;the analysis of perceptual processes by studying the effect on a subject&#x27;s experience or behaviour of systematically varying the properties of a stimulus along one or more physical dimensions&quot;.

&quot;Psychophysics&quot; also refers to a general class of methods that can be applied to study a perceptual system. Modern applications rely heavily on threshold measurement, ideal observer analysis, and signal detection theory.

Psychophysics has widespread and important practical applications. For instance, in the realm of digital signal processing, insights from psychophysics have guided the development of models and methods for lossy compression. These models help explain why humans typically perceive minimal loss of signal quality when audio and video signals are compressed using lossy techniques.

==History==
Many of the classical techniques and theories of psychophysics were formulated in 1860 when Gustav Theodor Fechner in Leipzig published &quot;Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics)&quot;. He coined the term &quot;psychophysics&quot;, describing research intended to relate physical stimuli to the contents of consciousness such as sensations &quot;(Empfindungen)&quot;. As a physicist and philosopher, Fechner aimed at developing a method that relates matter to the mind, connecting the publicly observable world and a person&#x27;s privately experienced impression of it. His ideas were inspired by experimental results on the sense of touch and light obtained in the early 1830s by the German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber in Leipzig, most notably those on the minimum discernible difference in intensity of stimuli of moderate strength (just noticeable difference; jnd) which Weber had shown to be a constant fraction of the reference intensity, and which Fechner referred to as Weber&#x27;s law. From this, Fechner derived his well-known logarithmic scale, now known as Fechner scale. Weber&#x27;s and Fechner&#x27;s work formed one of the bases of psychology as a science, with Wilhelm Wundt founding the first laboratory for psychological research in Leipzig (Institut für experimentelle Psychologie). Fechner&#x27;s work systematised the introspectionist approach (psychology as the science of consciousness), that had to contend with the Behaviorist approach in which even verbal responses are as physical as the stimuli.

Fechner&#x27;s work was studied and extended by Charles S. Peirce, who was aided by his student Joseph Jastrow, who soon became a distinguished experimental psychologist in his own right. Peirce and Jastrow largely confirmed Fechner&#x27;s empirical findings, but not all. In particular, a classic experiment of Peirce and Jastrow rejected Fechner&#x27;s estimation of a threshold of perception of weights. In their experiment, Peirce and Jastrow in fact invented randomized experiments: They randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights. On the basis of their results they argued that the underlying functions were continuous, and that there is no threshold below which a difference in physical magnitude would be undetected. Peirce&#x27;s experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1900s.

The Peirce–Jastrow experiments were conducted as part of Peirce&#x27;s application of his pragmaticism program to human perception; other studies considered the perception of light, etc. Jastrow wrote the following summary: &quot;Mr. Peirce’s courses in logic gave me my first real experience of intellectual muscle. Though I promptly took to the laboratory of psychology when that was established by Stanley Hall, it was Peirce who gave me my first training in the handling of a psychological problem, and at the same time stimulated my self-esteem by entrusting me, then fairly innocent of any laboratory habits, with a real bit of research. He borrowed the apparatus for me, which I took to my room, installed at my window, and with which, when conditions of illumination were right, I took the observations. The results were published over our joint names in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;. The demonstration that traces of sensory effect too slight to make any registry in consciousness could none the less influence judgment, may itself have been a persistent motive that induced me years later to undertake a book on &quot;The Subconscious&quot;.&quot; This work clearly distinguishes observable cognitive performance from the expression of consciousness.

Modern approaches to sensory perception, such as research on vision, hearing, or touch, measure what the perceiver&#x27;s judgment extracts from the stimulus, often putting aside the question what sensations are being experienced. One leading method is based on signal detection theory, developed for cases of very weak stimuli. However, the subjectivist approach persists among those in the tradition of Stanley Smith Stevens (1906–1973). Stevens revived the idea of a power law suggested by 19th century researchers, in contrast with Fechner&#x27;s log-linear function (cf. Stevens&#x27; power law). He also advocated the assignment of numbers in ratio to the strengths of stimuli, called magnitude estimation. Stevens added techniques such as magnitude production and cross-modality matching. He opposed the assignment of stimulus strengths to points on a line that are labeled in
order of strength. Nevertheless, that sort of response has remained popular in applied psychophysics. Such multiple-category layouts are often misnamed Likert scaling after the question items used by Likert to create multi-item psychometric scales, e.g., seven phrases from &quot;strongly agree&quot; through &quot;strongly disagree&quot;.

Omar Khaleefa has argued that the medieval scientist Alhazen should be considered the founder of psychophysics. Although al-Haytham made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and such claims have been rebuffed.

==Thresholds==
Psychophysicists usually employ experimental stimuli that can be objectively measured, such as pure tones varying in intensity, or lights varying in luminance. All the canonical senses have been studied: vision, hearing, touch (including skin and enteric perception), taste, smell, and the sense of time. Regardless of the sensory domain, there are three main areas of investigation: absolute thresholds, discrimination thresholds (e.g. the just-noticeable difference), and scaling.

A threshold (or &quot;limen&quot;) is the point of intensity at which the participant can just detect the presence of a stimulus (absolute threshold) or the difference between two stimuli (difference threshold). Stimuli with intensities below this threshold are not detectable and are considered subliminal. Stimuli at values close to a threshold may be detectable on some occasions; therefore, a threshold is defined as the point at which a stimulus or change in a stimulus is detected on a certain proportion of trials.

===Detection===
An absolute threshold is the level of intensity at which a subject can detect the presence of a stimulus a certain proportion of the time; a level of 50% is commonly used. For example, consider the absolute threshold for tactile sensation on the back of one&#x27;s hand. A participant might not feel a single hair being touched, but might detect the touch of two or three hairs, as this exceeds the threshold. The absolute threshold is also often referred to as the &quot;detection threshold&quot;. Various methods are employed to measure absolute thresholds, similar to those used for discrimination thresholds (see below).

===Discrimination===
A difference threshold (or just-noticeable difference, JND) is the magnitude of the smallest difference between two stimuli of differing intensities that a participant can detect a certain proportion of the time, with the specific percentage depending on the task. Several methods are employed to test this threshold. For instance, the subject may be asked to adjust one stimulus until it is perceived as identical to another (method of adjustment), to describe the direction and magnitude of the difference between two stimuli, or to decide whether the intensities in a pair of stimuli are the same or different (forced choice). The just-noticeable difference is not a fixed quantity; rather, it varies depending on the intensity of the stimuli and the specific sense being tested. According to Weber&#x27;s Law, the just-noticeable difference for any stimulus is a constant proportion, regardless of variations in intensity.

In discrimination experiments, the experimenter seeks to determine at what point the difference between two stimuli, such as two weights or two sounds, becomes detectable. The subject is presented with one stimulus, for example, a weight, and is asked to say whether another weight is heavier or lighter. In some experiments, the subject may also indicate that the two weights are the same. At the point of subjective equality (PSE), the subject perceives both weights as identical. The just-noticeable difference, or difference limen (DL), is the magnitude of the difference in stimuli that the subject notices some proportion of the time; typically, 50% is used for in the comparison task. Additionally, the two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm is used to assess the point at which performance reduces to chance in discriminating between two alternatives; here, is typically 75%, as a 50% success rate corresponds to chance in the 2AFC task.

Absolute and difference thresholds are sometimes considered similar in principle because background noise always interferes with our ability to detect stimuli.

==Experimentation==
In psychophysics, experiments seek to determine whether the subject can detect a stimulus, identify it, differentiate between it and another stimulus, or describe the magnitude or nature of this difference. Software for psychophysical experimentation is overviewed by Strasburger.

===Classical psychophysical methods===
Psychophysical experiments have traditionally used three methods for testing subjects&#x27; perception in stimulus detection and difference detection experiments: the method of limits, the method of constant stimuli and the method of adjustment.

====Method of limits====
In the ascending method of limits, some property of the stimulus starts out at a level so low that the stimulus could not be detected, then this level is gradually increased until the participant reports that they are aware of it. For example, if the experiment is testing the minimum amplitude of sound that can be detected, the sound begins too quietly to be perceived, and is made gradually louder. In the descending method of limits, this is reversed. In each case, the threshold is considered to be the level of the stimulus property at which the stimuli are just detected.

In experiments, the ascending and descending methods are used alternately and the thresholds are averaged. A possible disadvantage of these methods is that the subject may become accustomed to reporting that they perceive a stimulus and may continue reporting the same way even beyond the threshold (the error of habituation). Conversely, the subject may also anticipate that the stimulus is about to become detectable or undetectable and may make a premature judgment (the error of anticipation).

To avoid these potential pitfalls, Georg von Békésy introduced the staircase procedure in 1960 in his study of auditory perception. In this method, the sound starts out audible and gets quieter after each of the subject&#x27;s responses, until the subject does not report hearing it. At that point, the sound is made louder at each step, until the subject reports hearing it, at which point it is made quieter in steps again. This way the experimenter is able to &quot;zero in&quot; on the threshold.

====Method of constant stimuli====
Instead of being presented in ascending or descending order, in the method of constant stimuli the levels of a certain property of the stimulus are not related from one trial to the next, but presented randomly. This prevents the subject from being able to predict the level of the next stimulus, and therefore reduces errors of habituation and expectation. For &#x27;absolute thresholds&#x27; again the subject reports whether they are able to detect the stimulus. For &#x27;difference thresholds&#x27; there has to be a constant comparison stimulus with each of the varied levels.
Friedrich Hegelmaier described the method of constant stimuli in an 1852 paper. This method allows for full sampling of the psychometric function, but can result in a lot of trials when several conditions are interleaved.

====Method of adjustment====
In the method of adjustment, the subject is asked to control the level of the stimulus and to alter it until it is just barely detectable against the background noise, or is the same as the level of another stimulus. The adjustment is repeated many times. This is also called the &quot;method of average error&quot;.
In this method, the observers themselves control the magnitude of the variable stimulus, beginning with a level that is distinctly greater or lesser than a standard one and vary it until they are satisfied by the subjective equality of the two. The difference between the variable stimuli and the standard one is recorded after each adjustment, and the error is tabulated for a considerable series. At the end, the mean is calculated giving the average error which can be taken as a measure of sensitivity.

===Adaptive psychophysical methods===
The classic methods of experimentation are often argued to be inefficient. This is because, in advance of testing, the psychometric threshold is usually unknown and most of the data are collected at points on the psychometric function that provide little information about the parameter of interest, usually the threshold. Adaptive staircase procedures (or the classical method of adjustment) can be used such that the points sampled are clustered around the psychometric threshold. Data points can also be spread in a slightly wider range, if the psychometric function&#x27;s slope is also of interest. Adaptive methods can thus be optimized for estimating the threshold only, or both threshold &quot;and&quot; slope. Adaptive methods are classified into staircase procedures (see below) and Bayesian, or maximum-likelihood, methods. Staircase methods rely on the previous response only, and are easier to implement. Bayesian methods take the whole set of previous stimulus-response pairs into account and are generally more robust against lapses in attention. Practical examples are found here.

====Staircase procedures====


Staircases usually begin with a high intensity stimulus, which is easy to detect. The intensity is then reduced until the observer makes a mistake, at which point the staircase &#x27;reverses&#x27; and intensity is increased until the observer responds correctly, triggering another reversal. The values for the last of these &#x27;reversals&#x27; are then averaged. There are many different types of staircase procedures, using different decision and termination rules. Step-size, up/down rules and the spread of the underlying psychometric function dictate where on the psychometric function they converge. Threshold values obtained from staircases can fluctuate wildly, so care must be taken in their design. Many different staircase algorithms have been modeled and some practical recommendations suggested by Garcia-Perez.

One of the more common staircase designs (with fixed-step sizes) is the 1-up-N-down staircase. If the participant makes the correct response N times in a row, the stimulus intensity is reduced by one step size. If the participant makes an incorrect response the stimulus intensity is increased by the one size. A threshold is estimated from the mean midpoint of all runs. This estimate approaches, asymptotically, the correct threshold.

====Bayesian and maximum-likelihood procedures====

Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) adaptive procedures behave, from the observer&#x27;s perspective, similar to the staircase procedures. The choice of the next intensity level works differently, however: After each observer response, from the set of this and all previous stimulus/response pairs the likelihood is calculated of where the threshold lies. The point of maximum likelihood is then chosen as the best estimate for the threshold, and the next stimulus is presented at that level (since a decision at that level will add the most information). In a Bayesian procedure, a prior likelihood is further included in the calculation. Compared to staircase procedures, Bayesian and ML procedures are more time-consuming to implement but are considered to be more robust. Well-known procedures of this kind are Quest, ML-PEST, and Kontsevich &amp; Tyler&#x27;s method.

====Magnitude estimation====
In the prototypical case, people are asked to assign numbers in proportion to the magnitude of the stimulus. This psychometric function of the geometric means of their numbers is often a power law with stable, replicable exponent. Although contexts can change the law &amp; exponent, that change too is stable and replicable. Instead of numbers, other sensory or cognitive dimensions can be used to match a stimulus and the method then becomes &quot;magnitude production&quot; or &quot;cross-modality matching&quot;. The exponents of those dimensions found in numerical magnitude estimation predict the exponents found in magnitude production. Magnitude estimation generally finds lower exponents for the psychophysical function than multiple-category responses, because of the restricted range of the categorical anchors, such as those used by Likert as items in attitude scales.

<doc id="438005" wikidata="Q742302" url="?curid=438005" title="New Criticism">
<text>New Criticism was a formalist movement in literary theory that dominated American literary criticism in the middle decades of the 20th century. It emphasized close reading, particularly of poetry, to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from John Crowe Ransom&#x27;s 1941 book &quot;The New Criticism&quot;.

The works of Cambridge scholar I. A. Richards, especially his &quot;Practical Criticism&quot;, &quot;The Principles of Literary Criticism&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot;, which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of a New Critical methodology. Cleanth Brooks, John Crowe Ransom, W. K. Wimsatt, and Monroe Beardsley also made significant contributions to New Criticism. It was Wimsatt and Beardsley who introduced the ideas of intentional fallacy and affective fallacy. Also very influential were the critical essays of T. S. Eliot, such as &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot; and &quot;Hamlet and His Problems&quot;, in which Eliot developed his notions of the &quot;theory of impersonality&quot; and &quot;objective correlative&quot; respectively. Eliot&#x27;s evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of John Milton and John Dryden, his liking for the so-called metaphysical poets, and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon.

==Formalism theory==
New Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors, taking this approach under the influence of nineteenth-century German scholarship. The New Critics felt that this approach tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the New Critics disparaged the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the &quot;beauties&quot; and morally elevating qualities of the text, as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for a newer, systematic and objective method.

It was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on &quot;the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism&quot;. Literature was approached via its moral, historical and social background and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.

New Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader&#x27;s response, the author&#x27;s intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom&#x27;s &quot;Criticism, Inc.&quot; and Allen Tate&#x27;s &quot;Miss Emily and the Bibliographer&quot;.

Close reading (or &quot;explication de texte&quot;) was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns and the study of modern poets were the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by feminist literary criticism and structuralism in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, post-structuralism, and deconstructionist theory, the New Historicism, and Reception studies followed.

Although the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of John Crowe Ransom of Kenyon College, whose students (all Southerners), Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Robert Penn Warren would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at Trinity College, New Criticism is a reemergence of the Southern Agrarians. In his essay, &quot;The New Criticism&quot;, Cleanth Brooks notes that &quot;The New Critic, like the Snark, is a very elusive beast&quot;, meaning that there was no clearly defined &quot;New Critical&quot; manifesto, school, or stance. Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas.

In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot;, in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author&#x27;s intention, or &quot;intended meaning&quot; in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, &quot;The Affective Fallacy&quot;, which served as a kind of sister essay to &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot; Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader&#x27;s personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay &quot;Literature in the Reader&quot; (1970).

The hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Poetry&quot; and &quot;Understanding Fiction&quot; both became staples during this era.

Studying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as rhyme, meter, setting, characterization, and plot were used to identify the theme of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for paradox, ambiguity, irony, and tension to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text.

Although the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like close reading) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, New Testament narrative criticism, and reader-response theory. It has been credited with anticipating the insights of the linguistic turn and for showing significant ideological and historical parallels with logical positivism.

==Criticism==
It was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were &quot;uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.&quot;

Indicative of the reader-response school of theory, Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that &quot;the subject and the object of study—the reader and the text—are stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification,&quot; an assumption which he identifies as the &quot;ideology of liberal humanism,&quot; which is attributed to the New Critics who are &quot;accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.&quot; For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to &quot;[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a &#x27;ready-made&#x27; product.&quot;

In response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay &quot;The New Criticism&quot; (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, &quot;If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader—to the reader&#x27;s response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for &#x27;realizing&#x27; any poem or novel. ... Reader response is certainly worth studying.&quot; However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, &quot;to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste.&quot;

Another objection against New Criticism is that it misguidedly tries to turn literary criticism into an objective science, or at least aims at &quot;bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.&quot; One example of this is Ransom&#x27;s essay &quot;Criticism, Inc.&quot;, in which he advocated that &quot;criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic&quot;. René Wellek, however, argued against this by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in contrast to the &quot;objectivity&quot; of the sciences.

Wellek defended the New Critics in his essay &quot;The New Criticism: Pro and Contra&quot; (1978).

The New Criticism is not supported by Feminist Theory which is often concerned with sexual identity and the human body. Nor is it aligned with post-colonial theory which deals with dual-identity, personal experience and political bias in writing.

<text>Caloric is a brand of kitchen appliances, which dates back to 1903.

== History==
Caloric Corporation began as the Klein Stove Company in Philadelphia in 1890. The Caloric brand was introduced in 1903. It was reorganized in 1946 as the Caloric Stove Company in Topton, Pennsylvania. The company was renamed Caloric Appliance Corp. in 1954 and became famous for offering a complete package of kitchen appliances in the 1950s and 1960s. Its most popular product was their built-in wall oven. In 1967, it was acquired by Raytheon Corporation which also owned Amana refrigerators and Speed Queen laundry products. By the early 1990s, Caloric was absorbed into Amana and the Caloric brand was phased out. The Topton plant was shut down in 1991. In 1997 the company was purchased by Goodman Global, a heating-and-cooling manufacturer who sold it to Maytag (now part of Whirlpool) in 2002.

One important feature of the Caloric gas stove in the 1960s was the infrared burner, which cooks through radiant heat. This distinguished Caloric ovens from their competitors, which produced gas ovens comprising two burners: one positioned lower for baking and another positioned on top for broiling.

The Janesville Caloric Company factory existed from 1908 to 1924. It manufactured the Caloric Cooker, a “fireless cook stove” and precursor to modern day slow cookers. The company operated out of an old furniture factory. The Caloric Cooker consisted of an insulated cabinet with one or more deep wells fitted with soapstones on the top and on the bottom. After the stones were heated, the food was put into the wells. The lid could be closed and the meal cooked without danger of its burning. About 150 men were employed by this company when it was in full production. The cookers sold for $8.50 – $15, depending on the number of wells, and came with a 160-page book instruction manual. The company moved operations to Pennsylvania in 1924. 

In the 1960s, the Caloric Company launched the iconic ad slogan “Now you’re cooking with gas.”

== Revival ==
JMM Lee Properties announced in 2012 the reintroduction of Caloric appliances beginning with a line of stainless steel ovens and ranges in the fall of 2012. They plan on adding more built-in and countertop appliances over the following year.

In Canada, J.A.K. North America Inc. has the rights to market Caloric branded appliances.

== In popular culture ==

In the 1960s CBS television series The Dick Van Dyke Show, the Petrie&#x27;s New Rochelle kitchen features a Caloric Ultramatic wall oven. The 2010-2016 CBS situation comedy series &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot; featured a Caloric gas range in the home of Molly&#x27;s mother.

<text>Pierre Jaquet-Droz (; 1721–1790) was a watchmaker of the late eighteenth century. He was born on 28 July 1721 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, in the Principality of Neuchâtel, which was then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. He lived in Paris, London, and Geneva, where he designed and built animated dolls known as automata to help his firm sell watches and mechanical caged songbirds.

The Jaquet Droz luxury watch brand is now owned by The Swatch Group.

==Notable works==
Constructed between 1768 and 1774 by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, his son Henri-Louis (1752-1791), and Jean-Frédéric Leschot (1746-1824), the automata include &quot;The Writer&quot; (made of 6000 pieces), &quot;The Musician&quot; (2500 pieces), and &quot;The Draughtsman&quot; (2000 pieces).

His astonishing mechanisms fascinated the kings and emperors of Europe, China, India and Japan.

Some consider these devices to be the oldest examples of the computer. &quot;The Writer&quot;, a mechanical boy who writes with a quill pen upon paper with real ink, has an input device to set tabs, defining individual letters written by the boy, that form a programmable memory. It has 40 cams that represent the read-only program. The work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz predates that of Charles Babbage by decades.

The automata of Jaquet-Droz are considered to be some of the finest examples of human mechanical problem solving. Three particularly complex and still functional dolls, now known as the Jaquet-Droz automata, are housed at the Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire (art and history museum) in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.

He once constructed a clock that was capable of the following surprising movements:There were seen on it a negro, a dog, and a shepherd; when the clock struck, the shepherd played six tunes on his flute, and the dog approached and fawned upon him. This clock was exhibited to the King of Spain, who was delighted with it. &quot;The gentleness of my dog,&quot; said Droz, &quot;is his least merit; if your Majesty touch one of the apples, which you see in the shepherd&#x27;s basket, you will admire the fidelity of this animal.&quot; The King took an apple, and the dog flew at his hand, and barked so loud, that the King&#x27;s dog, which was in the room, began also to bark; at this the Courtiers, not doubting that it was an affair of witchcraft, hastily left the room, crossing themselves as they went out. The minister of Marine was the only one that ventured to stay. The king having desired him to ask the negro what o&#x27;clock it was, the minister obeyed, but he obtained no reply. Droz then observed, that the negro had not yet learned Spanish.

<text>The is a foldable handheld game console produced by Nintendo, released globally across 2004 and 2005. The DS, an initialism for &quot;Developers&#x27; System&quot; or &quot;Dual Screen&quot;, introduced distinctive new features to handheld games: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one being a touchscreen), a built-in microphone, and support for wireless connectivity. Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Its main competitor was Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable during the seventh generation of video game consoles.

Prior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental &quot;third pillar&quot; in Nintendo&#x27;s console lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance family and GameCube. However, backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series. On March 2, 2006, Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite, a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens and a longer lasting battery. On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the [[Nintendo DSi]], another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features, although it lost backward compatibility for Game Boy Advance titles and a few DS games that used the GBA slot. On November 21, 2009, Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi XL, a larger version of the DSi.

All Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units, making it the best-selling Nintendo system, the best-selling handheld game console, and the second best-selling video game console of all time. The Nintendo DS was succeeded by the Nintendo 3DS in February 2011.
== History ==
=== Development ===
Development on the Nintendo DS began around mid-2002, following an original idea from former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi about a dual-screened console. On November 13, 2003, Nintendo announced that it would be releasing a new game product in 2004. The company did not provide many details, but stated it would not succeed the Game Boy Advance or GameCube. On January 20, 2004, the console was announced under the codename &quot;Nintendo DS&quot;. Nintendo released only a few details at that time, saying that the console would have two separate, 3-inch TFT LCD display panels, separate processors, and up to 1 gigabit (128 MB) of semiconductor memory. Current Nintendo president at the time, Satoru Iwata, said, &quot;We have developed Nintendo DS based upon a completely different concept from existing game devices in order to provide players with a unique entertainment experience for the 21st century.&quot; He also expressed optimism that the DS would help put Nintendo back at the forefront of innovation and move away from the conservative image that had been used to describe the company in years past. In March 2004, a document containing most of the console&#x27;s technical specifications was leaked, also revealing its internal development name, &quot;Nitro&quot;. In May 2004, the console was shown in prototype form at E3 2004, still under the name &quot;Nintendo DS&quot;, which Reggie Fils-Aimé announced would change for launch. On July 28, 2004, Nintendo revealed a new design that was described as &quot;sleeker and more elegant&quot; than the one shown at E3 and announced Nintendo DS as the device&#x27;s official name. Following lukewarm GameCube sales, Hiroshi Yamauchi stressed the importance of its success to the company&#x27;s future, making a statement which can be translated from Japanese as, &quot;If the DS succeeds, we will rise to heaven, but if it fails we will sink to hell.&quot;

=== Launch ===
President Iwata referred to Nintendo DS as &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s first hardware launch in support of the basic strategy &#x27;Gaming Population Expansion because the touch-based device &quot;allows users to play intuitively&quot;. On September 20, 2004, Nintendo announced that the Nintendo DS would be released in North America on November 21, 2004, for US$149.99. It was set to release on December 2, 2004, in Japan for JP¥15,000; on February 24, 2005, in Australia for A$199.95; and on March 11, 2005, in Europe for €149.99 (£99.99 in the United Kingdom). The console was released in North America with a midnight launch event at Universal CityWalk EB Games in Los Angeles, California. The console was launched quietly in Japan compared to the North America launch; one source cited the cold weather as the reason.

====North America and Japan====
The Nintendo DS was launched in North America for US$149.99 on November 21, 2004; in Japan for JP¥15,000 on December 2 in the color &quot;Titanium&quot;. Well over three million preorders were taken in North America and Japan; preorders at online stores were launched on November 3 and ended the same day as merchants had already sold their allotment. Initially, Nintendo planned to deliver one million units combined at the North American and Japanese launches; when it saw the preorder numbers, it brought another factory online to ramp up production. Nintendo originally slated 300,000 units for the U.S. debut; 550,000 were shipped, and just over 500,000 of those sold through in the first week. Later in 2005, the manufacturer suggested retail price for the Nintendo DS was dropped to US$129.99.

Both launches proved to be successful, but Nintendo chose to release the DS in North America prior to Japan, a first for a hardware launch from the Kyoto-based company. This choice was made to get the DS out for the largest shopping day of the year in the U.S. (the day after Thanksgiving, also known as &quot;Black Friday&quot;). Perhaps partly due to the release date, the DS met unexpectedly high demand in the United States, selling 1 million units by December 21, 2004. By the end of December, the total number shipped worldwide was 2.8 million, about 800,000 more than Nintendo&#x27;s original forecast. At least 1.2 million of them were sold in the U.S. Some industry reporters referred to it as &quot;the Tickle Me Elmo of 2004&quot;. In June 2005, Nintendo informed the press that a total of 6.65 million units had been sold worldwide.
As is normal for electronics, some were reported as having problems with stuck pixels in either of the two screens. Although return policies for LCD displays vary between manufacturers and regions, in North America, Nintendo chose to replace a system with faulty pixels only if the owner claimed that it interfered with their gaming experience. There were two exchange programs in place for North America. In the first, the owner of the defective DS in question would provide a valid credit card number and, afterward, Nintendo would ship a new DS system to the owner with shipping supplies to return the defective system. In the second, the owner of the defective DS in question would have shipped their system to Nintendo for inspection. After inspection, Nintendo technicians would have either shipped a replacement system or fixed the defective system. The first option allowed the owner to have a new DS in 3–5 business days.

Multiple games were released alongside the DS during its North American launch on November 21, 2004. At launch there was one pack-in demo, in addition to the built-in PictoChat program: &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt&quot; (published by Nintendo and is a demo for &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;, a game released in March 2006). At the time of the &quot;Electric Blue&quot; DS launch in June 2005, Nintendo bundled the system with &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;.

In Japan, the games were released at the same time as the system&#x27;s first release (December 2, 2004). In the launch period, &quot;The Prince of Tennis 2005 -Crystal Drive-&quot; (Konami) and &quot;Puyo Puyo Fever&quot; (Sega) were released.

====Europe====
The DS was released in Europe on March 11, 2005, for €149. A small supply of units was available prior to this in a package with a promotional &quot;VIP&quot; T-shirt, &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters - First Hunt&quot;, a &quot;&quot; demo and a pre-release version of &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, through the Nintendo Stars Catalogue; the bundle was priced at £129.99 for the UK and €189.99 for the rest of Europe, plus 1,000 of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;star&quot; loyalty points (to cover postage). By June 28, 2005, 1 million DS units had been sold in Europe, setting a sales record for a handheld console.

The European release of the DS, like the U.S., was originally packaged with a &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt&quot; demo. The European game cases are additionally about thicker than their North American counterparts and transparent rather than solid black. Inside the case, there is room for one Game Boy Advance game pack and a DS card with the instructions on the left side of the case.

====Australia and New Zealand====
The DS launched in Australia and New Zealand on February 24, 2005. It retailed in Australia for AU$199 and in New Zealand for NZ$249. Like the North American launch, it includes the &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters - First Hunt&quot; demo. The first week of sales for the system broke Australian launch sales records for a console, with 19,191 units sold by the 27th.

====China====
&quot;iQue DS&quot;, the official name of the Chinese Nintendo DS, was released in China on June 15, 2005. The price of the iQue DS was 980 RMB (roughly US$130) as of April 2006. This version of the DS includes updated firmware to block out the use of the PassMe device, along with the new Red DS. Chinese launch games were &quot;Zhi Gan Yi Bi&quot; (&quot;Polarium&quot;) (Nintendo/iQue) and &quot;Momo Waliou Zhizao&quot; (&quot;&quot;) (Nintendo/iQue). The iQue name was first used for a device that was based on Nintendo 64 hardware in 2003, after China banned sales of home video games in that region years prior.

====Games available on launch====

=== Promotion ===
The system&#x27;s promotional slogans revolve around the word &quot;Touch&quot; in almost all countries, with the North American slogan being &quot;Touching is good.&quot;

The Nintendo DS was seen by many analysts to be in the same market as Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable, although representatives from both companies stated that each system targeted a different audience. &quot;Time&quot; magazine awarded the DS a Gadget of the Week award.

At the time of its release in the United States, the Nintendo DS retailed for . The price dropped to on August 21, 2005, one day before the releases of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; and &quot;Advance Wars: Dual Strike&quot;.

Nine official colors of the Nintendo DS were available through standard retailers. Titanium-colored units were available worldwide, Electric Blue was exclusive to North and Latin America. There was also a red version which was bundled with the game &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;. Graphite Black, Pure White, Turquoise Blue, and Candy Pink were available in Japan. Mystic Pink and Cosmic Blue were available in Australia and New Zealand. Japan&#x27;s Candy Pink and Australia&#x27;s Cosmic Blue were also available in Europe and North America through a &quot;Nintendogs&quot; bundle, although the colors are just referred to as pink and blue; however, these colors were available only for the original style Nintendo DS; a different and more-limited set of colors were used for the Nintendo DS Lite.

=== DS Lite ===

The Nintendo DS Lite was announced on January 26, 2006, and was later showcased at E3 2006 in May at the Los Angeles Convention Center. In Japan, the Nintendo DS Lite was released on March 2, 2006. Numerous colors and limited editions were released throughout its lifetime, such as pink casing. Due to lack of supply and excessive demand following the launch, many electronics distributors raised the retail price of the redesigned handheld console. Even though Nintendo managed to release 550,000 units in March 2006 (which was above their initial projections), the DS Lite was sold out soon after its launch. The shortage was supposed to be eased after Nintendo released 700,000 Nintendo DS Lites during April 2006; however, retailers in Tokyo sold out yet again by late May 2006. This shortage would last for most of 2006 and 2007 with retailers all around the country having permanent signage apologizing for the shortage but stating that the arrival time of new stock was unknown. When new product arrived, it would sell out within days. Since restocking was erratic, looking for the product often involved several visits to different retailers, and most of the time without finding the product. This was still the case in Japan as of April 25, 2007, with stores turning away potential customers every day and selling out quickly. 

A larger model of the DS Lite was an unreleased alternative to the DS Lite.

The Nintendo DS Lite was released in Australia on June 1, 2006, and came with a demo for &quot;Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s Brain Training: How Old Is Your Brain?&quot;. The Nintendo DS Lite was released in North America on June 11, 2006. There had been various reports of North American Target, Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Meijer stores having sold Nintendo DS Lite units as early as May 30, 2006, breaking the official launch date. On June 12, 2006, &quot;GameSpot&quot; reported that the Nintendo DS Lites had sold out at major online retailers, as well as several brick-and-mortar stores in North America. On June 13, 2006, Nintendo announced that 136,500 units were sold in two days since the DS Lite went on sale in North America, and seemed to be on pace to the 500,000 sold by the original Nintendo DS in its first ten days. Shortly after its launch, the DS Lite was sold out at major US retailers; however, it did not have the same ongoing shortages in the US as it did in Japan through 2006 and 2007.

The Nintendo DS Lite was released in Europe on June 23, 2006. In Finland and Sweden, the DS Lite was released on June 22, 2006, due to Midsummer. In just 10 days, Nintendo announced it had sold 200,000 Nintendo DS Lites in Europe. On June 12, 2006, Chinese media organization Sina.com reported that a container intended for shipment to Europe was stolen, which contained 18 million (2.32 million) worth of goods, including black Nintendo DS Lite consoles and games. Later, &quot;GamesIndustry.biz&quot; reported that Nintendo had confirmed that &quot;A number of White DS Lite made for the UK market were stolen in Hong Kong.&quot;

Nintendo opened its subsidiary, Nintendo of Korea, on July 20, 2006. The DS Lite was the first console to be released in South Korea by the subsidiary, being released on January 18, 2007. Popular Korean actors Jang Dong-gun and Ahn Sung-ki were enlisted to help promote the console. Nintendo of Korea stated they had sold more than one million units in the first year of sale with around 1.4 million sold as of April 2008.

The DS Lite was reportedly discontinued in April 2011.

=== Sales ===

As of March 31, 2016, all Nintendo DS models combined have sold 154.02 million units. The majority of these were made up of the first revision model, the DS Lite, according to Nintendo.

=== Legacy ===
The success of the Nintendo DS introduced touchscreen controls and wireless online gaming to a wide audience. According to Damien McFerran of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, the &quot;DS was the first encounter many people had with touch-based tech, and it left an indelible impression.&quot;

The DS established a large casual gaming market, attracting large non-gamer audiences and establishing touchscreens as the standard controls for future portable gaming devices. According to Jeremy Parish, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, the Nintendo DS laid the foundations for touchscreen mobile gaming on smartphones. He stated that the DS &quot;had basically primed the entire world for&quot; the iPhone, released in January 2007, and that the DS paved the way for iPhone gaming mobile apps. However, the success of the iPhone &quot;effectively caused the DS market to implode&quot; by the early 2010s, according to Parish.

The DS also enlarged the market for female gamers. According to Nintendo in 2006, 44% of DS owners were female, with the majority of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; owners being female.

The success of the DS paved the way for its successor, the Nintendo 3DS, a handheld gaming console with a similar dual-screen setup that can display images on the top screen in stereoscopic 3D.

On January 29, 2014, Nintendo announced that Nintendo DS games would be added to the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console, with the first game, &quot;Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!&quot;, being released in Japan on June 3, 2014.

== Hardware ==
The Nintendo DS design resembles that of the multi-screen games from the Game &amp; Watch line, such as &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Zelda&quot;, which was also made by Nintendo.

The lower display of the Nintendo DS is overlaid with a resistive touchscreen designed to accept input from the included stylus, the user&#x27;s fingers, or a curved plastic tab attached to the optional wrist strap. The touchscreen lets users interact with in-game elements more directly than by pressing buttons; for example, in the included chatting software, PictoChat, the stylus is used to write messages or draw.

The handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and Power buttons. On the top of the device are two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, a stylus holder and a power cable input. The bottom features the Game Boy Advance game card slot. The overall button layout resembles that of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System controller. When using backward compatibility mode on the DS, buttons X and Y and the touchscreen are not used as the Game Boy Advance line of systems do not feature these controls.

It also has stereo speakers providing virtual surround sound (depending on the software) located on either side of the upper display screen. This was a first for a Nintendo handheld, as the Game Boy line of systems had only supported stereo sound through the use of headphones or external speakers. A built-in microphone is located below the left side of the bottom screen. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including speech recognition, chatting online between and during gameplay sessions, and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into it.

=== Technical specifications ===
The system&#x27;s 3D hardware consists of rendering engine and geometry engine which perform transform and lighting, Transparency Auto Sorting, Transparency Effects, Texture Matrix Effects, 2D Billboards, Texture Streaming, texture-coordinate transformation, perspective-correct texture mapping, per-pixel Alpha Test, per-primitive alpha blending, texture blending, Gouraud Shading, cel shading, z-buffering, W-Buffering, 1bit Stencil Buffer, per-vertex directional lighting and simulated point lighting, Depth Test, Stencil Test, Render to Texture, Lightmapping, Environment Mapping, Shadow Volumes, Shadow Mapping, Distance Fog, Edge Marking, Fade-In/Fade-Out, Edge-AA. Sprite special effects: scrolling, scaling, rotation, stretching, shear. However, it uses point (nearest neighbor) texture filtering, leading to some titles having a blocky appearance. Unlike most 3D hardware, it has a set limit on the number of triangles it can render as part of a single scene; the maximum amount is about 6144 vertices, or 2048 triangles per frame. The 3D hardware is designed to render to a single screen at a time, so rendering 3D to both screens is difficult and decreases performance significantly. The DS is generally more limited by its polygon budget than its pixel fill rate. There are also 512 kilobytes of texture memory, and the maximum texture size is 1024 × 1024 pixels.

The system has 656 kilobytes of video memory and two 2D engines (one per screen). These are similar to (but more powerful than) the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s single 2D engine.

The Nintendo DS has compatibility with Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is used for accessing the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, compete with other users playing the same Wi-Fi compatible game, PictoChat or with a special cartridge and RAM extension, browse the internet.

Nintendo claims the battery lasts a maximum of 10 hours under ideal conditions on a full four-hour charge. Battery life is affected by multiple factors including speaker volume, use of one or both screens, use of wireless connectivity, and use of backlight, which can be turned on or off in selected games such as &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;. The battery is user-replaceable using only a Phillips-head screwdriver. After about 500 charges the battery life starts to decrease.

Users can close the Nintendo DS system to trigger its &#x27;sleep&#x27; mode, which pauses the game being played and saves battery life by turning off the screens, speakers, and wireless communications; however, closing the system while playing a Game Boy Advance game will not put the Nintendo DS into sleep mode, and the game will continue to run normally. Certain DS games (such as &quot;Animal Crossing: Wild World&quot;) will also not pause, but the backlight, screens, and speakers will turn off. Additionally, when saving the game in certain games the DS will not go into sleep mode. Some games, such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass&quot;, use the closing motion needed to enter sleep mode as an unorthodox way of solving puzzles, or include gameplay sequences that require the console to be closed, such as &quot;Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck&quot;.

=== Accessories ===

Although the secondary port on the Nintendo DS does accept and support Game Boy Advance cartridges (but not Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridges), Nintendo emphasized that the main intention for its inclusion was to allow a wide variety of accessories to be released for the system.

Due to the lack of a second port on the Nintendo DSi, it is not compatible with any accessory that uses it.

==== Rumble Pak ====

The Rumble Pak was the first official expansion slot accessory. In the form of a Game Boy Advance cartridge, the Rumble Pak vibrates to reflect the action in compatible games, such as when the player bumps into an obstacle or loses a life. It was released in North America and Japan in 2005 bundled with &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot;. In Europe, it was first available with the game &quot;Actionloop&quot;, and later &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot;. The Rumble Pak was also released separately in those regions.

==== Headset ====
The Nintendo DS Headset is the official headset for the Nintendo DS. It plugs into the headset port (which is a combination of a standard 3.5 mm (1/8 in) headphone connector and a proprietary microphone connector) on the bottom of the system. It features one earphone and a microphone, and is compatible with all games that use the internal microphone. It was released alongside &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; in North America, and Australia.

==== Browser ====

On February 15, 2006, Nintendo announced a version of the cross-platform web browser Opera for the DS system. The browser can use one screen as an overview, a zoomed portion of which appears on the other screen, or both screens together to present a single tall view of the page. The browser went on sale in Japan and Europe in 2006, and in North America on June 4, 2007. Browser operation requires that an included memory expansion pak is inserted into the GBA slot. The DSi has a web browser available for download from the Nintendo DSi shop for free.

==== Wi-Fi USB Connector ====

This USB-flash-disk-sized accessory plugs into a PC&#x27;s USB port and creates a miniature hotspot/wireless access point, allowing a Wii and up to five Nintendo DS units to access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service through the host computer&#x27;s Internet connection. When tried under Linux and Mac, it acts as a regular wireless adapter, connecting to wireless networks, an LED blinks when there is data being transferred. There is also a hacked driver for Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 to make it function the same way. The Wi-Fi USB Connector was discontinued from retail stores.

==== MP3 Player ====

The Nintendo MP3 Player (a modified version of the device known as the Play-Yan in Japan) was released on December 8, 2006, by Nintendo of Europe at a retail price of £29.99/€30. The add-on uses removable SD cards to store MP3 audio files, and can be used in any device that features support for Game Boy Advance cartridges; however, due to this, it is limited in terms of its user-interface and functionality, as it does not support using both screens of the DS simultaneously, nor does it make use of its touch-screen capability. It is not compatible with the DSi, due to the lack of the GBA slot, but the DSi includes a music player via SD card. Although it stated on the box that it is only compatible with the Game Boy Micro, Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite, it is also compatible with the Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Advance.

==== Guitar grip controller ====
The Guitar grip controller comes packaged with the game &quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour&quot; and is plugged into the GBA game slot. It features four colored buttons like the ones found on regular &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; guitar controllers for the stationary consoles, though it lacks the fifth orange button found on the guitar controllers. The DS Guitar Hero controller comes with a small &quot;pick-stylus&quot; (which is shaped like a guitar pick, as the name suggests) that can be put away into a small slot on the controller. It also features a hand strap. The game works with both the DS Lite and the original Nintendo DS as it comes with an adapter for the original DS. The Guitar Grip also works with its sequels, &quot;Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits&quot;, and &quot;Band Hero&quot;.

===Revisions===
==== Nintendo DS Lite ====
The Nintendo DS Lite is the first redesign of the Nintendo DS. While retaining the original model&#x27;s basic characteristics, it features a sleeker appearance, larger stylus, longer lasting battery, and brighter screens. The screens have a maximum brightness of 200cd/m2 for the top screen and 190cd/m2 for the bottom screen (touch screen). The lithium-ion battery (1000 mAh) is capable of delivering 15 to 19 hours of play time on a single charge; a power-saving sleep mode is also available. The console takes roughly three hours to fully charge the battery. The DS Lite uses an AC power adapter that differs from the one used for the original Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance SP due to a smaller adaptor AC port on the top of the unit. The included stylus is 1cm longer and 2mm thicker than the stylus of the original Nintendo DS.

==== Nintendo DSi and DSi XL ====
The Nintendo DSi is the second redesign of the Nintendo DS. It is based on the unreleased larger DS Lite model. While similar to the previous DS redesign, new features include two inner and outer 0.3 megapixel digital cameras, a larger 3.25 inch display, internal and external content storage, compatibility with WPA wireless encryption, and connectivity to the Nintendo DSi Shop.

The Nintendo DSi XL features larger screens, and a greater overall size, than the original DSi. It is the fourth DS model, the first to be available as a pure size variation. It features larger screens with wider view angles, improved battery life, and a greater overall size than the original DSi. While the original DSi was specifically designed for individual use, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata suggested that DSi XL buyers give the console a &quot;steady place on a table in the living room&quot;, so that it might be shared by multiple household members.

== Software and features ==
=== Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ===

Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was a free online game service run by Nintendo. Players with a compatible Nintendo DS game could connect to the service via a Wi-Fi network using a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector or a wireless router. The service was launched in North America, Australia, Japan &amp; Europe throughout November 2005. An online compatible Nintendo DS game was released on the same day for each region.
Additional Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Connection games and a dedicated Nintendo DS web browser were released afterwards. Nintendo later believed that the online platform&#x27;s success directly propelled the commercial success of the entire Nintendo DS platform. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection served as part of the basis of what would become the Wii. Most functions (for games on both the DS and Wii consoles) were discontinued worldwide on May 20, 2014.

===Download Play===

With Download Play, it is possible for users to play multiplayer games with other Nintendo DS systems, and later Nintendo 3DS systems, using only one game card. Players must have their systems within wireless range (up to approximately 65 feet) of each other for the guest system to download the necessary data from the host system. Only certain games supported this feature and usually played with much more limited features than the full game allowed.

Download Play is also utilized to migrate Pokémon from fourth generation games into the fifth generation &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, an example of a task requiring two different game cards and two handheld units, but only one player.

Some Nintendo DS retailers featured DS Download Stations that allowed users to download demos of current and upcoming DS games; however, due to memory limitations, the downloads were erased once the system was powered off. The Download Station was made up of 1 to 8 standard retail DS units, with a standard DS card containing the demo data. On May 7, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo Channel for download on the Wii. The Nintendo Channel used WiiConnect24 to download Nintendo DS demos through it. From there, a user can select the demo they wish to play and, similar to the Nintendo DS Download Stations at retail outlets, download it to their DS and play it until it is powered off.

=== Multi-Card Play ===
Multi-Card Play, like Download Play, allows users to play multiplayer games with other Nintendo DS systems. In this case, each system requires a game card. This mode is accessed from an in-game menu, rather than the normal DS menu.

=== PictoChat ===
PictoChat allows users to communicate with other Nintendo DS users within local wireless range. Users can enter text (via an on screen keyboard), handwrite messages or draw pictures (via the stylus and touchscreen). There are four chatrooms (A, B, C, D) in which people can go to chat. Up to sixteen people can connect in any one room.

PictoChat was not available for the subsequent Nintendo 3DS series of systems.

=== Firmware ===
Nintendo&#x27;s own firmware boots the system. A health and safety warning is displayed first, then the main menu is loaded. The main menu presents the player with four main options to select: play a DS game, use PictoChat, initiate DS Download Play, or play a Game Boy Advance game. The main menu also has secondary options such as turning on or off the back light, the system settings, and an alarm.

The firmware also features a clock, several options for customization (such as boot priority for when games are inserted and GBA screen preferences), and the ability to input user information and preferences (such as name, birthday, favorite color, etc.) that can be used in games.

Japanese, American, and European consoles support the following languages: English, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.

On consoles from mainland China, Chinese replaces Japanese and on Korean consoles, Italian is replaced by Korean.

Later revisions of the DS released after 2006 feature the added option to toggle screen brightness levels, as with the DS Lite.

== Games ==

=== Compatibility ===
The Nintendo DS is backward compatible with Game Boy Advance (GBA) cartridges. The smaller Nintendo DS game cards fit into a slot on the top of the system, while Game Boy Advance games fit into a slot on the bottom. The Nintendo DS, like the Game Boy Micro, is not backward compatible with games made for the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color because the required hardware is not included and the console has physical incompatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.

The handheld does not have a port for the Game Boy Advance Link Cable, so multiplayer and GameCube–Game Boy Advance link-up modes are not available in Game Boy Advance titles. Only single-player mode is supported on the Nintendo DS, as is the case with Game Boy Advance games played via the Virtual Console on the Nintendo 3DS (Ambassadors only) and Wii U.

The Nintendo DS only uses one screen when playing Game Boy Advance games. The user can configure the system to use either the top or bottom screen by default. The games are displayed within a black border on the screen, due to the slightly different screen resolution between the two systems (256 × 192 px for the Nintendo DS, and 240 × 160 px for the Game Boy Advance).

Nintendo DS games inserted into the top slot are able to detect the presence of specific Game Boy Advance games in the bottom slot. In many such games, either stated in-game during gameplay or explained in its instruction manual, extra content can be unlocked or added by starting the Nintendo DS game with the appropriate Game Boy Advance game inserted. Among those games were the popular &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; or &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot;, which allowed the player to find more/exclusive Pokémon in the wild if a suitable Game Boy Advance cartridge was inserted. Some of the content can stay permanently, even after the GBA game has been removed.

Additionally, the GBA slot can be used to house expansion paks, such as the Rumble Pak, Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak, and Guitar Grips for the &quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour&quot; series. The Nintendo DSi and the DSi XL have an SD card slot instead of a second cartridge slot and cannot play Game Boy Advance games or &quot;Guitar Hero: On Tour&quot;. In certain Wii games such as Band Hero, the player can use a Nintendo DS for additional features.

=== Regional division ===
The Nintendo DS is region free in the sense that any console will run a Nintendo DS game purchased anywhere in the world; however, the Chinese iQue DS games cannot be played on other versions of the original DS, whose firmware chip does not contain the required Chinese character glyph images; this restriction is removed on Nintendo DSi and 3DS systems. Although the Nintendo DS of other regions cannot play the Chinese games, the iQue DS can play games of other regions. Also, as with Game Boy games, some games that require both players to have a Nintendo DS game card for multiplayer play will not necessarily work together if the games are from different regions (e.g. a Japanese Nintendo DS game may not work with a North American copy, even though some titles, such as &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; are mutually compatible). With the addition of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, certain games can be played over the Internet with users of a different region game.

Some Wi-Fi enabled games (e.g. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;) allow the selection of opponents by region. The options are &quot;Regional&quot; (&quot;Continent&quot; in Europe) and &quot;Worldwide&quot;, as well as two non-location specific settings. This allows the player to limit competitors to only those opponents based in the same geographical area. This is based on the region code of the game in use.

The Nintendo DSi, however, has a region lock for DSiWare downloadable games, as well as DSi-specific cartridges. It still runs normal DS games of any region, however.

=== Media specifications ===
Nintendo DS games use a proprietary solid state mask ROM in their game cards. The mask ROM chips are manufactured by Macronix and have an access time of 150 ns. Cards range from 8–512 MiB (64 Mib to 4 Gib) in size (although data on the maximum capacity has not been released). Larger cards have a 25% slower data transfer rate than more common smaller cards. The cards usually have a small amount of flash memory or an EEPROM to save user data such as game progress or high scores. The game cards are (about half the width and depth of Game Boy Advance cartridges) and weigh around 3.5 g ( oz).

== Hacking and homebrew ==
In South Korea, many video game consumers exploit illegal copies of video games, including the DS. In 2007, over 500,000 copies of DS games were sold, while the sales of the DS hardware units was 800,000.

Another modification device called Action Replay, manufactured by the company Datel, is a device which allows the user to input cheat codes that allows it to hack games, granting the player infinite health, power-ups, access to any part of the game, infinite in game currency, the ability to walk through walls, and various other abilities depending on the game and code used.

<doc id="438036" wikidata="Q5472642" url="?curid=438036" title="Fortifications of Portsmouth">
<text>The fortifications of [[Portsmouth]] are extensive due to its strategic position on the English Channel and role as home to the Royal Navy. For this reason, Portsmouth was, by the 19th century, one of the most fortified cities in the world. The fortifications have evolved over the centuries in response to changes in tactics and technology and the area defended has increased. While the first defences focused on Portsmouth harbour, in step with the fortifications of Gosport, later defensive structures protected the whole of Portsea Island and an increasing distance inland. At the same time, the fortifications of Portsmouth and Gosport became part of the wider fortifications of the Solent. Old Portsmouth, on the southwest corner of Portsea Island, has been walled for much of its history.

== The first fortifications ==

The first fortification in the area was Portchester Castle, which, ultimately, dates back to the Roman Portus Adurni. Its position allowed it to provide a degree of defence for the upper reaches of Portsmouth Harbour. The first recorded fortifications on Portsea Island appear to have been a wall constructed in 1212 around a primitive shipyard sited just to the north of what later became Camber Dock. The wall lasted less than twelve years.

During the 14th century, Portsmouth was subject to attacks in 1338, 1369, 1377 and 1380. Evidence suggests that simple earthworks were constructed and reconstructed around the settlement in response. The first structure built to defend Portsmouth proper was a wooden version of the Round Tower constructed between 1418 and 1426. Four years later, a second wooden tower was added on the opposite side of the harbour.

== Expansion under the Tudors ==
During Henry VII&#x27;s rule, the Round Tower was rebuilt in stone and the Square Tower added. There is, however, some question as regards the extent to which it was meant to be a defensive structure. It appears likely that what is now known as the &quot;saluting platform&quot; was also built during Henry VII&#x27;s reign. Southsea Castle at the southern tip of Portsea Island was built by his son and successor Henry VIII.

To the north of the city, it is believed that a small fortification was constructed to defend the bridge across Portsbridge Creek. In 1522, the first of several defensive chains that could be raised in an attempt to block the harbour entrance was ordered.

By 1542, Portsmouth was surrounded by defensive ramparts and towers built from earth and wood. One tower was positioned on the corner where the wall extending from the saluting platform met the wall running along the southeast rampart of the town. The southeast rampart was also equipped with what appears to be a firing platform, while another tower was constructed on the corner where the ramparts to the south east and the northeast of the town met. In the centre of the northwest rampart was the town gate defended by a structure known as The Mount which also acted as a bastion. Finally, the wall to the north of the town had a tower at each end one where it joined the northeast wall and one where it met the sea. Gabions were constructed along the edge of the Camber dock area and a palisade made to separate Portsmouth Point from the town. A wooden wall was constructed between the Round Tower and the saluting platform at around the same time.

The next phase of expansion started in the late 1550s and continued through the rest of Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign. From about 1560, the work was largely under the direction of Richard Popynjay. The ramparts were updated and the gabions along the edge of the Camber and the palisade that cut off Portsmouth point were replaced by stone wall. Other works including improving the various towers with some of them developing into bastions. The Mount defending the town gate was reconstructed, developing into what could be considered a true bastion in the process. The saluting platform also saw some rebuilding work during this period.

Another development during this period is that an increasing number of the names used for the fortifications survived until the present day. The bastion on the corner where the wall extending from the saluting platform met the wall running along the southeast rampart of the town was recorded as Green&#x27;s Bulwark or Chaterton&#x27;s Bulwark. Of the two towers on the corners of the north wall of the town the one at the western end was known as the Dock Bulwark while the one at the eastern end is recorded as Guyes Bulwark. The mount is also recorded as being known as the Great Bastion. The gate that controlled access to Portsmouth point was known as the North Gate although by 1571 it (along with other parts of the fortifications) was in a poor state of repair.

The second half of Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign saw yet more work on the bastions and the first bridge at the Landport gate which was constructed in about 3 years starting 1586. During this time there also appears to have seen a fair amount of repair work. Sometime around 1600 a new gate known as point gate replaced the North Gate in controlling access to Portsmouth point.

== During the Civil War ==
At the time of the Civil War, the fortifications mounted around 100 guns and when properly manned were considered by some to be able to withstand a siege of 40,000 men. In one of the first actions of the civil war Parliament managed to capture the city from the royalist forces during the Siege of Portsmouth.

== Reconstruction under Charles II ==

In 1665, Charles II ordered Bernard de Gomme to begin the reconstruction of Portsmouth&#x27;s fortifications, a process which was to take many years. The year before this a new chain to block the harbour entrance was ordered at a cost of £200. Starting 1678 Fort James was constructed on Burrow Island. Later in the 1680s Southsea castle was rebuilt. In the same decade the Portsbridge fort was also rebuilt.

The city walls were again rebuilt. A second moat was also added with a new defensive line being constructed between the two moats. A ravelin was added at Landport where the London road entered the city.
On the shoreline a new battery was built at the end of Portsmouth point facing Gosport. Another battery, this one with 18 guns, was built that connected to the round tower with a further battery constructed between the square tower and the saluting platform. Beyond this battery, but connected to it by a tunnel, Spur redoubt was constructed.

While the towns defences were being strengthened some thought appears to have been given to their aesthetic appearance. In 1665 Lieutenant-Governor Sir Philip Honeywood ordered that trees be planted on the town walls.
In 1679 Sir Bernard de Gomme built barracks within the town to accommodate two Companies of Foot (120 men) to man the defences. His plan and specification for the building (a double range of ten bays, long by deep) represents &#x27;the earliest known detailed drawing of a barracks in England&#x27;. The soldiers slept two to a bed, four to a room, with additional rooms being provided for officers at each end of the block, and for sergeants in the middle of the ground floor. By 1684 there were barracks in addition at the Round Tower, and a two-storey block at the Landport Gate.

The first true fortification of the dockyard was constructed between 1665 and 1668 although there had previously been a wall around it. The fortification consisted of an earthen rampart with a single bastion and two demi-bastions.

Later in the 17th century in 1688 the fort protecting the crossing across Portsbridge creek was rebuilt under the direction of the Chief Royal Engineer Sir Martin Beckman.

== 18th century ==

In the 18th century, Portsea started to grow up around the dockyard and in the 1770s a series of ramparts and moats were constructed to protect this new settlement.

The sheer manpower required by de Gomme&#x27;s defences meant that after about 1730 the double moat system used around Portsmouth was abandoned with the outer moat being filled in.

At the same time the defences started to focus on protecting the whole of Portsea island. The Portsbridge fort was again rebuilt in 1746. During 1756 and 1757 the first Hilsea lines were constructed in order to protect the north of Portsea island. The first Fort Cumberland was constructed to prevent hostile forces from sailing to Langstone harbour and the first Lumps Fort and Eastney battery were built to protect Eastney beach.

==19th century==

The city and harbour&#x27;s most recent comprehensive fortifications were built as a result of the 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom and consist of the Palmerston Forts in the Solent, the line of Forts situated along the top of Portsdown Hill, forts in Gosport and the Hilsea Lines.

Fort Cumberland and Lumps Fort were significantly rebuilt.

The Portsea fortifications were expanded slightly in the 1840s and 1860s as the dockyard was extended.

The city walls though were for the most part removed in the 1870s and 80s a task accomplished through the use of convict labour.

==20th century==
Improvements in artillery technology had rendered the various landward facing fortifications obsolete over the turn of the century and by the end of the first decade they largely disarmed.

After World War 1 the city council started to buy various defences as they were released by the military. The 1920s and 30s saw the purchase of much of the Hilsea lines and Lumps fort by the city.

During WW2 anti tank defence blocks were constructed on Fraser Beach. Pill boxes were constructed to defend Portsmouth Airport in the form of Pickett-Hamilton Forts. The sea forts were re-equipped with AA guns. A new concrete gun emplacement which contained a single 75mm gun was constructed on the eastern part of the Hilsea lines.

The remaining defences were deactivated when the UK abandoned coastal artillery in 1956.

==Surviving fortifications==

Of the defences constructed Portsea Island, Southsea Castle, Fort Cumberland, The Round tower, The Square tower, Lumps Fort, Parts of the Hilsea lines, the Spur Redoubt and parts of the walls of old Portsmouth along the seafront all survive. Various fortifications within the naval dockyard also exist.

Beyond Portsea the majority of the Portsdown Forts remain although Fort Wallington has been largely demolished.

Of the four gates in the walls of Old Portsmouth only Landport Gate survives in its original position. King James&#x27;s gate, Lion Gate and Unicorn Gate have been re-erected slightly further away.

Antitank defence blocks on Fraser Beach are now a grade 2 listed structure. A pair of links from one of the harbour boom chains are on display at Southsea castle. One of the Pickett-Hamilton forts constructed to protect the airport was on display outside the D-Day Story in Southsea. This was removed in 2017 when the museum was refurbished.

<text>Cabaret Mechanical Theatre is an English organisation that mounts exhibitions around the world of contemporary automata by a collective of artists. Founded by Sue Jackson, the group played a central role in the revival of automata from the 1970s onwards,
and Jackson championed the idea of automata as a form of contemporary art.

Cabaret Mechanical Theatre was started in 1979 in Falmouth, Cornwall, where Jackson encouraged local artists Peter Markey, Paul Spooner and Ron Fuller to manufacture automata for her craft shop, &quot;Cabaret&quot;. The shop became an exhibition space and the collection moved to Covent Garden, central London, in 1984, remaining there until 2000
when rising rates forced it to close.

Part of the Cabaret Mechanical Theatre collection can be seen at the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. Three machines made by Tim Hunkin, which were formerly part of the Covent Garden display, have been moved to Hunkin&#x27;s own exhibition Novelty Automation in Holborn, London.

<doc id="438043" wikidata="Q5764368" url="?curid=438043" title="Hilsea Lines">
<text>The Hilsea Lines are a line of 18th- and 19th-century fortifications built at Hilsea to protect the northern approach to Portsea Island, an island off the southern coast of England which forms the majority of the city of Portsmouth and its key naval base. They are now used as a greenspace and leisure area, also known locally as &quot;Foxes Forest&quot;.

==Natural defences==
The island is separated from the mainland by a narrow stretch of water called Portsbridge Creek. The first means of crossing the creek was by stepping stones, followed by a single track bridge, built to allow the passage of pedestrians and horse-drawn carts to have access to Portsea Island.

==Early defences==
Early defences were focused on the &#x27;Portsbridge&#x27; that crossed the creek. A fortification is thought to have been built at the mainland end of the bridge during the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1642 the fort was captured by parliamentary forces as part of the English Civil War. It was rebuilt in 1688 and again in 1746. During the Civil War further defences were constructed by the royalists consisting of a wooden barricade mounted on the bridge backed by a small fort equipped with 4 cannon. The cannon were withdrawn on 10 August 1642 and with the barricade held by as few as eight men the parliamentarian forces were able to cross the creek two days later. The Parliamentarians then constructed their own defences of at the site of the bridge consisting of two mounds on which a total of 6 cannon were mounted. The Parliamentarians appear to have constructed further defences near the bridge in 1643.

==The first lines==

During 1756 and 1757 defensive lines were constructed on the Portsea Island side of the creek under the supervision of John Peter Desmaretz. They consisted of a and ditch backed by a rampart. Water could be allowed to flow into the ditch from sluices at either end.

==The current lines==

The current lines were constructed between 1858 and 1871. They included special fortified bridges for road and rail access. A model of the Hilsea Lines featured in the 1862 International Exhibition. Even before their completion the Hilsea Lines had been rendered obsolete by the 1859 Royal Commission and advances in artillery technology; as such they were the last full bastioned trace constructed in the United Kingdom. The development of rifled artillery meant that it was now possible for an enemy to occupy the high ridge of Portsdown Hill north of Portsmouth and shell the naval base from several miles away without having to attack the Hilsea Lines. To counter the new threat a series of &quot;Palmerston Forts&quot; were constructed on Portsdown Hill and the Hilsea Lines were scaled back. In particular a pair of forts that it had been planned to place behind the lines were not constructed.

As completed, the lines are largely built from clay and chalk and were high when completed. Traffic on the London Road passed through the lines via a pair of , tunnels. There was also an , tunnel for pedestrians. The section containing the tunnels was demolished in 1919.

Then a further tunnel through the lines was provided for the railway. Finally, a and tunnel was built through the West centre curtain to act as a sally port.

It was originally planned to equip the lines with smoothbore guns; however, it appears the guns may never have been fitted. In 1886 the lines were equipped with a mix of RML 7 inch guns and RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns on Moncrieff mountings fitted in newly constructed concrete emplacements. Further RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns were fitted in the original casements. The guns were removed in 1903. A QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss was mounted on the lines during World War 1. A small number of guns were mounted on the lines during World War II.

==Post military use==

When the lines were built large amounts of land was purchased by the crown to the rear of the lines. Part of this land behind the west bastion was sold to the city of Portsmouth in 1926 which built a housing estate, a school and a recreation ground on it. During 1929 and 1930 the city purchased the east bastion, the curtain wall and the land behind them. This land was used as the site for a new road link to the mainland and Portsmouth Airport. At the same time the city also purchased the West Bastion. In 1932, the eastern lines were dynamited to make room for the airport.

In the 1930s western end of the moat became known as the Hilsea lagoon and in the mid-1930s work was done on the banks and it was turned into a boating lake. In the same period the land between the boating lake and the lines was converted into part of the Hilsea bastion gardens. Most of the gardens were destroyed as the result of road widening in 1968–70. In 1986 the city bought those parts of the lines that were not already under its control. The terraces that formed part of the gardens were demolished in 2000.
In 1938 a bridge was built across the boating lake section of the moat. It was demolished in 1999 and later replaced by the current structure.

Today the lines are accessible for most of their length, but overgrown and derelict in places. The moat is used for fishing. In May 2006 the moat experienced some flooding. Most of the lines are designated as a scheduled ancient monument. In 2010 the lines were given a Green Flag Award.

There is a walk around the Hilsea Lines by the Mountbatten Centre to the A27 Roundabout and Reverse.

In January 2017 the casemates have various uses. Bastion 6 is currently undergoing works to become a Nationally Recognised World War One Centre of excellence headed up by Charles J Haskell and Benjamin Edward French, a relocation from the current World War One Remembrance Centre set up at Fort Widley, Portsmouth. Bastion 5, which is owned by Portsmouth City Council, is currently in a derelict state, due to vandalism and destruction by local youths, it is listed on the Heritage At Risk Register maintained by Historic England. Bastion 4 has a commercial use as Casemates Rehearsal Studios. Bastion 3 is used by Volunteer Groups and the Portsmouth City Council funded Hilsea Lines Ranger. Bastion 1 is owned and occupied by Portsmouth Grammar School and is used by their Physical Education Department.

The nature reserve at Hilsea Lines has in recent decades become locally known as &quot;Foxes Forest&quot;.

<doc id="438044" wikidata="Q293599" url="?curid=438044" title="Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib">
<text>Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib () was a paternal uncle and sahabi (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, just three years older than his nephew. A wealthy merchant, during the early years of Islam he protected Muhammad while he was in Mecca, but only became a convert after the Battle of Badr in 624 CE (2 AH). His descendants founded the Abbasid dynasty in 750.

== Early years ==
Abbas, born around 565 CE, was one of the younger sons of Abd al-Muttalib. His mother was Nutayla bint Janab of the Namir tribe. After his father&#x27;s death, he took over the Zamzam Well and the distribution of water to the pilgrims. He became a spice merchant in Mecca, a trade that made him wealthy. Within this role, he managed a caravan network to and from Syria, where he eventually recruited and trained Muhammad as an apprentice for leading the northern leg of the journey.

== Conversion to Islam ==
During the years when the Muslim religion was gaining adherents (610–622), Abbas provided protection to his kinsman but did not adopt the faith. He acted as a spokesman at the Second Pledge of Aqaba, but he was not among those who emigrated to Medina.

Having fought on the side of the polytheists, Abbas was captured during the Battle of Badr. Muhammad allowed al-Abbas to ransom himself and his nephew.

Ibn Hisham said that Abbas had become a secret Muslim before the Battle of Badr; but a clear statement to that effect is missing from Tabari&#x27;s citation of the same source. It is said by some authorities that he converted to Islam shortly after the Battle of Badr.

It is elsewhere implied that Abbas did not formally profess Islam until January 630, just before the fall of Mecca, twenty years after his wife Lubaba converted. Muhammad then named him &quot;last of the migrants&quot; (Muhajirun), which entitled him to the proceeds of the spoils of war. He was given the right to provide Zamzam water to pilgrims, a right which was passed down to his descendants.

Abbas immediately joined Muhammad&#x27;s army, participating in the Conquest of Mecca, the Battle of Hunayn and the Siege of Ta&#x27;if. He defended Muhammad at Hunayn when other warriors deserted him. After these military exploits, Abbas brought his family to live in Medina, where Muhammad frequently visited them and even proposed marriage to his daughter.

Later Abbas fought in the expedition to Tabuk.

== Family ==
Abbas had at least five wives.
#Lubaba bint al-Harith (Arabic: لبابة بنت الحارث), also known as Umm al-Fadl, was from the Banu Hilal tribe. Umm al-Fadl claimed to be the second woman to convert to Islam, the same day as her close friend Khadijah, the first wife of Muhammad. Umm al-Fadl&#x27;s traditions of the Prophet appear in all canonical collections of hadiths. She showed her piety by supernumerary fasting and by attacking Abu Lahab, the enemy of the Muslims, with a tent pole.
#Fatima bint Junayd, from the Al-Harith clan of the Quraysh tribe.
#Hajila bint Jundub ibn Rabia, from the Hilal tribe.
#Musliya, a Greek concubine.
#Tukana, a Jewish woman from the Qurayza tribe, whom Abbas married after 632. It is not known whether any of the children were hers.
The known children of Abbas were:
#Al-Faraa, who married Qatn ibn Al-Harith, a brother of Lubaba. Her mother is not named.
The following were all the offspring of Lubaba.
#Al-Fadl.
#Abd Allah.
#Ubayd Allah. Ubayd Allah&#x27;s daughter Lubaba married Abbas ibn Ali and had a son Ubayd Allah ibn Abbas ibn Ali.
#Qutham.
#Ma&#x27;bad.
#Abd al-Rahman.
#Umm Habib. 
Other children
#Al-Harith. His mother is said to have been either Fatima or Hajila.
#Awn, whose mother is not named.
#Mushir, whose mother is not named.
#Kathir, son of Musliya.
#Amina, probably the daughter of Musliya.
#Safiya, probably the daughter of Musliya.
#Tammam, the youngest, son of Musliya.

== Death ==
Abbas died in February 653 at the age of 89. He is buried at the Jannatul Baqee cemetery in Medina, Saudi Arabia.

== Descendants ==

The Abbasid dynasty founded in 750 by Abu al-ʻAbbās ʻAbdallāh as-Saffāh better known as &quot;As-Saffah&quot; claimed the title of caliph (literally &quot;successor&quot;) through their descent from Abbas&#x27;s son Abdallah.

Many other families claimed direct descent from Abbas, including the Kalhoras of Sindh, Daudpotas of Bahawalpur, Abbasi&#x27;s of Murree Pakistan, Abbasi&#x27;s of Bagh, Azad Kashmir the Berber Banu Abbas, and the modern-day Bawazir of Yemen and Shaigiya and Ja&#x27;alin of Sudan.

<text>A refugee camp is a temporary settlement built to receive refugees and people in refugee-like situations. Refugee camps usually accommodate displaced people who have fled their home country, but camps are also made for internally displaced people. Usually, refugees seek asylum after they have escaped war in their home countries, but some camps also house environmental and economic migrants. Camps with over a hundred thousand people are common, but as of 2012, the average-sized camp housed around 11,400. They are usually built and run by a government, the United Nations, international organizations (such as the International Committee of the Red Cross), or non-governmental organization. Unofficial refugee camps, such as Idomeni in Greece or the Calais jungle in France, are where refugees are largely left without the support of governments or international organizations.

Refugee camps generally develop in an impromptu fashion with the aim of meeting basic human needs for only a short time. Facilities that make a camp look or feel more permanent are often prohibited by host country governments. If the return of refugees is prevented (often by civil war), a humanitarian crisis can result or continue.

According to UNHCR, most refugees worldwide do not live in refugee camps. At the end of 2015, some 67% of refugees around the world lived in individual, private accommodations. This can be partly explained by the high number of Syrian refugees renting apartments in urban agglomerations across the Middle East. Worldwide, slightly over a quarter (25.4%) of refugees were reported to be living in managed camps. At the end of 2015, about 56% of the total refugee population in rural locations resided in a managed camp, compared to the 2% who resided in individual accommodation. In urban locations, the overwhelming majority (99%) of refugees lived in individual accommodations, compared with less than 1% who lived in a managed camp. A small percentage of refugees also live in collective centres, transit camps, and self-settled camps.

Despite 74% of refugees being in urban areas, the service delivery model of international humanitarian aid agencies remains focused on the establishment and operation of refugee camps.

==Facilities==
The average camp size is recommended by UNHCR to be per person of the accessible camp area. Within this area, the following facilities can usually be found:
*An administrative headquarters to coordinate services may be inside or outside the actual camp.
*Sleeping accommodations are frequently tents, prefabricated huts, or dwellings constructed of locally available materials. UNHCR recommends a minimum of 3.5 m2 of covered living area per person. Shelters should be at least 2 m apart.
* Gardens attached to the family plot: UNHCR recommends a plot size of 15 m2 per person. 
*Hygiene facilities, such as washing areas, latrines, or toilets: UNHCR recommends one shower per 50 persons and one communal latrine per 20 persons. Distance for the latter should be no more than 50 meters from the shelter and not closer than 6 m. Hygiene facilities should be separated by gender.
*Places for water collection: Either water tanks where water is off-loaded from trucks (then filtered and potentially treated with disinfectant chemicals such as chlorine), or water tap stands that are connected to boreholes are needed. UNHCR recommends 20  L of water per person and one tap stand per 80 persons that should be no farther than 200 m away from households.
*Clinics, hospitals and immunization centres: UNHCR recommends one health centre per 20,000 persons and one referral hospital per 200,000 persons.
*Food distribution and therapeutic feeding centres: UNHCR recommends one food distribution centre per 5,000 persons and one feeding centre per 20,000 persons.
*Communication equipment (e.g. radio): Some long-standing camps have their own radio stations.
*Security, including protection from banditry (e.g. barriers and security checkpoints) and peacekeeping troops to prevent armed violence: Police stations may be outside the actual camp.
*Schools and training centres: UNHCR recommends one school per 5,000 persons.

*Markets and shops: UNHCR recommends one marketplace per 20,000 persons.

Schools and markets may be prohibited by the host country&#x27;s government to discourage refugees from settling permanently in camps. Many refugee camps also have:

*Cemeteries or crematoria
*Locations for solid waste disposal: One 100 L rubbish container should be provided per 50 persons and one refuses pit per 500 persons.
*Reception or transit centre where refugees initially arrive and register before they are allowed into the camp: Reception centres may be outside the camps and closer to the border of the country where refugees enter.
*Churches or other religious centres or places of worship

To understand and monitor an emergency over a period of time, the development and organisation of the camps can be tracked by satellite, and analyzed by GIS.

==Arrival==
Most new arrivals travel distances up to 500 km on foot. The journey can be dangerous, e.g. wild animals, armed bandits or militias, or landmines. Some refugees are supported by the International Organization for Migration, and some use smugglers. Many new arrivals suffer from acute malnutrition and dehydration. Long queues can develop outside the reception centres, and waiting times of up to two months are possible. People outside the camp are not entitled to official support (but refugees from inside may support them). Some locals sell water or food for excessive prices and make large profits. Not uncommonly, some refugees die while waiting outside the reception centre. They stay in the reception centre until their refugee status is approved and the degree of vulnerability assessed. This usually takes two weeks. They are then taken, usually by bus, to the camp. New arrivals are registered, fingerprinted, and interviewed by the host country&#x27;s government and the UNHCR. Health and nutrition screenings follow. Those who are extremely malnourished are taken to therapeutic feeding centres and the sick to a hospital. Men and women receive counselling separately from each other to determine their needs. After registration, they are given food rations (until then only high energy biscuits), receive ration cards (the primary marker of refugee status), soap, jerrycans, kitchen sets, sleeping mats, plastic tarpaulins to build shelters (some receive tents or fabricated shelters). Leaders from the refugee community may provide further support to the new arrivals.

==Housing and sanitation==

Residential plots are allocated (e.g. 10 x 12 m for a family of four to seven people). Shelters may sometimes be built by refugees themselves with locally available materials, but aid agencies may supply materials or even prefabricated housing. Shelters are frequently very close to each other, and frequently, many families share a single dwelling, rendering privacy for couples nonexistent. Camps may have communal unisex pit latrines shared by many households, but aid agencies may provide improved sanitation facilities. Household pit latrines may be built by families themselves. Latrines may not always be kept sufficiently clean and disease-free. In some areas, space for new pits is limited. Each refugee is supposed to receive around 20  L of water a day, but many have to survive on much less than that (some may get as little as 8  L per day). A high number of persons may use a tap stand (against a standard number of one per 80 persons). Drainage of water from bathroom and kitchen use may be poor and garbage may be disposed of in a haphazard fashion. Few or no sanitary facilities may be accessible for people with disabilities. Poor sanitation may lead to outbreaks of infectious disease, and rainy-season flooding of latrine pits increases the risk of infection.

==Food rations==
The World Food Programme (WFP) provides food rations twice a month: 2,100 calories/person/day. Ideally, it should be:
* whole grain (maize or sorghum)
* milled grain (wheat flour)
* 1.5 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 tablespoons pulses (beans or lentils)
Diet is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs. WFP is frequently unable to provide all of these staples, thus calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available, e.g. only maize flour. Up to 90% of the refugees sell part or most of their food ration to get cash. Loss of the ration card means no entitlement to food. In 2015, the WFP introduced electronic vouchers.

==Economy, work, and income==
Research found that if enough aid is provided, the refugees&#x27; stimulus effects can boost the host countries&#x27; economies. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has a policy of helping refugees work and be productive, using their existing skills to meet their own needs and needs of the host country, too:

Ensure the right of refugees to access work and other livelihood opportunities as they are available for nationals... Match programme interventions with corresponding levels of livelihood capacity (existing livelihood assets such as skills and past work experience) and needs identified in the refugee population, and the demands of the market... Assist refugees in becoming self-reliant. Cash / food / rental assistance delivered through humanitarian agencies should be short-term and conditional and gradually lead to self-reliance activities as part of longer-term development... Convene internal and external stakeholders around the results of livelihood assessments to jointly identify livelihood support opportunities.

Refugee-hosting countries, though, do not usually follow this policy and instead do not allow refugees to work legally. In many countries, the only option is either to work for a small incentive (with NGOs based in the camp) or to work illegally with no rights and often bad conditions. In some camps, refugees set up their own businesses. Some refugees even became rich with that. Those without a job or without relatives and friends who send remittances, need to sell parts of their food rations to get cash. As support does not usually provide cash, effective demand may not be created

The main markets of bigger camps usually offer electronics, groceries, hardware, medicine, food, clothing, cosmetics, and services such as prepared food (restaurants, coffee–tea shops), laundry, internet and computer access, banking, electronic repairs and maintenance, and education. Some traders specialize in buying food rations from refugees in small quantities and selling them in large quantities to merchants outside the camp. Many refugees buy in small quantities because they do not have enough money to buy normal sizes, i.e. the goods are put in smaller packages and sold for a higher price. Payment mechanisms used in refugee camps include cash aid/vouchers, in-kind payments (such as voluntary work), and community-based saving and lending.

Investment by outside private sector organizations in community-based energy solutions such as diesel generators, solar kiosks and biogas digesters has been identified as a way to promote community economic development and employment.

==Camp structure==
So, to UNHCR vocabulary a refugee camp consists of settlements, sectors, blocks, communities, and families. Sixteen families make up a community, sixteen communities make up a block, four blocks make up a sector, and four sectors are called a settlement. A large camp may consist of several settlements. Each block elects a community leader to represent the block. Settlements and markets in bigger camps are often arranged according to the nationalities, ethnicities, tribes, and clans of their inhabitants, such as at Dadaab and Kakuma.

==Democracy and justice ==
In those camps where elections are held, elected refugee community leaders are the contact point within the community for both community members and aid agencies. They mediate and negotiate to resolve problems and liaise with refugees, UNHCR, and other aid agencies. Refugees are expected to convey their concerns, messages, or reports of crimes, etc. through their community leaders. Therefore, community leaders are considered to be part of the disciplinary machinery and many refugees mistrust them. There are allegations of aid agencies bribing them. Community leaders can decide what a crime is and thus, whether it is reported to the police or other agencies. They can use their position to marginalize some refugees from minority groups. In Kakuma and Dadaab Refugee Camps in Kenya, Somali refugees have been allowed to establish their own &#x27;court&#x27; system which is funded by charities. Elected community leaders and the elders of the communities provide an informal kind of jurisdiction in refugee camps. They preside over these courts and are allowed to pocket the fines they impose. Refugees are left without legal remedies against abuses and cannot appeal against their own &#x27;courts&#x27;.

==Security==
Security in a refugee camp is usually the responsibility of the host country and is provided by the military or local police. The UNHCR only provides refugees with legal protection, not physical protection. However, local police or the legal system of the host countries may not take responsibility for crimes that occur within camps. In many camps, refugees create their own patrolling systems as police protection is insufficient. Most camps are enclosed with barbed wire fences. This is not only for the protection of the refugees, but also to prevent refugees from moving freely or interacting with local people.

Refugee camps may sometimes serve as headquarters for the recruitment, support and training of guerrilla organizations engaged in fighting in the refugees&#x27; area of origin; such organizations often use humanitarian aid to supply their troops. Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand and Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire supported armed groups until their destruction by military forces.

Refugee camps are also places where terror attacks, bombings, militia attacks, stabbings and shootings take place and abductions of aid workers are not unheard of. The police can also play a role in attacks on refugees.

==Health and health care==
Due to crowding and lack of infrastructure, refugee camps are often unhygienic, leading to a high incidence of infectious diseases and epidemics. Sick or injured refugees rely on free health care provided by aid agencies in camps, and may not have access to health services outside of a camp setting. Some aid agencies employ outreach workers who make visits from tent to tent to offer medical assistance to ill and malnourished refugees, but resources are often scarce. Vulnerable persons who have difficulties accessing services may be supported through individual case management. Common infectious diseases include diarrhea from various causes, malaria, viral hepatitis, measles, meningitis, respiratory infections such as influenza, and urinary/reproductive tract infections. These are exacerbated by malnutrition. In some camps, guards exchange food and money for sex with young girls and women, in what is called &quot;survival sex&quot;.

=== Reproductive health ===
The UNHCR is responsible for providing reproductive health services to refugee populations and in camps. This includes educating refugees on reproductive health, family planning, giving them access to healthcare professionals for their reproductive needs and providing necessary supplies such as feminine hygiene products.

=== Mental health ===
Refugees experience a wide range of traumas in their home country and during their journey to other countries. However, the mental health problems resulting from violent conflicts, such as PTSD and disaster-induced depression, can be compounded by problems induced by the conditions of refugee camps. Mental health concerns within humanitarian aid programs include stress about one&#x27;s home country, isolation from support structures, and loss of personal identity and agency.

These consequences are increased by the daily stresses of displacement and life within camps, including ongoing risks of violence, lack of basic services, and uncertainty about the future. Women and girls in camps often fear being alone, especially at night, because of the risk of trafficking and sexual violence. The most prevalent clinical problems among Syrian refugees are depression, prolonged grief disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorders. However, the perception of mental health is affected by cultural and religious values that result in different modes of expressing distress or making sense of psychological symptoms. In addition, refugees who have experienced torture often endure somatic symptoms in which emotional distress from torture is expressed in physical forms.

Unique conditions for the mental health of refugees within camps has led to the development of alternative psychological interventions and approaches. Some mental health services address the effects of negative discourses about migrants and the way that traumatic experiences affect and fragment identity. A therapeutic support project in the Calais refugee camp focused on building spaces of collectivity and community, such as youth groups, to challenge the individualization of distress and trauma. This project encouraged discussion of refugees&#x27; small acts of resistance to difficult situations and promoted activities from migrants&#x27; cultural roots to develop a positive conception of identity. Other mental health approaches acknowledge core cultural tenets and work to structure the camp itself around these values. For example, in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan, Pakistani policy prioritized the centrality of personal dignity and collective honour in the cultural traditions of Afghan migrants and constructed &quot;refugee tented villages&quot; that grouped people within their own ethnolinguistic, tribal, or regional communities.

==Freedom of movement==
Once admitted to a camp, refugees usually do not have the freedom to move about the country but are required to obtain Movement Passes from the UNHCR and the host country&#x27;s government. Yet informally many refugees are mobile and travel between cities and the camps, or otherwise make use of networks or technology in maintaining these links. Due to widespread corruption in public service, there is a grey area that creates space for refugees to manoeuvre. Many refugees in the camps, given the opportunity, try to make their way to cities. Some refugee elites even rotate between the camp and the city or rotate periods in the camp with periods elsewhere in the country in family networks, sometimes with another relative in a Western country that contributes financially. Refugee camps may serve as a safety net for people who go to cities or who attempt to return to their countries of origin. Some refugees marry nationals so that they can bypass the police rules regarding movements out of the camps. It is a lucrative side-business for many police officers working the area around the camps to have a lot of unofficial roadblocks and to target refugees travelling outside the camps who must pay bribes to avoid deportation.

==Duration and durable solutions==
Although camps are intended to be a temporary solution, some of them exist for decades. Some Palestinian refugee camps have existed since 1948, camps for Eritreans in Sudan (such as the Shagarab camp) have existed since 1968, the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria has existed since 1975, camps for Burmese in Thailand (such as the Mae La refugee camp) have existed since 1986, Buduburam in Ghana since 1990, or Dadaab and Kakuma in Kenya since 1991 and 1992, respectively. In fact, over half of the refugees as of the end of 2017 are in &quot;protracted refugee situations&quot;, defined as situations where at least 25,000 people from a particular country are refugees in another particular country for five or more years (though this might not be representative of refugees who are specifically in camps). The longer a camp exist the lower tends to be the annual international funding and the bigger the implications for human rights. Some camps grow into permanent settlements and even merge with nearby older communities, such as Ain al-Hilweh, Lebanon and Deir al-Balah, Palestine.

People may stay in these camps, receiving emergency food and medical aid, for many years and possibly even for their whole life. To prevent this the UNHCR promotes three alternatives to that:
* Once it is safe for them to return to their home countries the refugees can use voluntary return programmes. 
* In some cases, refugees may be integrated and naturalised by the country they fled to.
* In some cases, often after several years, refugees may get the offer to be resettled in &quot;third countries&quot;. Globally, about 17 countries (Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) regularly accept &quot;quota refugees&quot; from refugee camps. The UNHCR works in partnership with these countries and resettlement programmes, such as the Gateway Protection Programme, that support refugees after arrival in the new countries. In recent years, most quota refugees have come from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and the former Yugoslavia which have been disrupted by wars and revolutions.

==Notable refugee camps==

The largest refugee settlements in the world are in the eastern Sahel region of Africa. For many years the Dadaab complex was the largest until it was surpassed by Bidi Bidi in 2017. Bidi Bidi was in turn surpassed by Bangladesh&#x27;s Kutupalong refugee camp in 2018.

Refugees, mainly displaced people from Somalia, were either forced to relocate to Kakuma, repatriated or remunerated to voluntarily relocate into unsafe areas in Somalia. Other closed camps in the area include Liboi, Oda, Walda, Thika, Utange and Marafa.
* Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya was opened in 1991. In 2014, it was the third largest refugee camp worldwide. As of December 2020, Kakuma hosts 200,000 people, mostly migrants from the civil war in South Sudan.

* Philippine Refugee Processing Center for Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian refugees fleeing wars in Indochina.
* There are a number of camps in Nepal, such as the three Beldangi refugee camps, Goldhap, Khudunabari, Sanischare and Timai hosting Bhutanese refugees. They are Lhotshampas who were forced to flee from Bhutan to Nepal.
* There are a number of camps in Pakistan that host Afghan refugees, such as Panian, Nasir Bagh, Old Shamshatoo, Old Akora, Gamkol, Barakai, Badaber, Girdi Jungle, Azakhel and Saranan. Jelazee camp, which also hosted Afghan refugees was closed in 2001, because of security concerns.
* There are a number of camps, such as Puzhal, for Sri Lankan Tamils, established in Tamil Nadu in India in 1983, with over 110,000 refugees by 1998.
* There are two camps, Nayapara and Kutupalong, in south-eastern Bangladesh hosting 30,000 registered Rohingya people who fled from Myanmar. It is estimated that 200,000 undocumented Rohingya refugees are living outside the camps with little access to humanitarian assistance. Kutupalong camp may become one of the world&#x27;s largest refugee camps as there are plans to extend it, so up to 800,000 Rohingya refugees can be housed. 
* There were a number of camps on the Thai-Cambodian border in Thailand which hosted Khmer people and Vietnamese between 1979 and 1993 (see Indochina refugee crisis and Cambodian humanitarian crisis), such as Nong Samet, Nong Chan, Sa Kaeo, Site Two, and Khao-I-Dang. There were also camps in the Thai-Laotian border region, hosting Hmong people and Laotians, such as Ban Vinai and Nong Khai. These camps existed between 1975, and final closure in the 1990s.
* Whitehead Camp, Hong Kong, considered the &quot;world&#x27;s largest prison&quot; in the early 1990s

===Middle East===

* Al Kharaz in Yemen hosts 14,000 refugees from Somalia who crossed the Gulf of Aden.
* Al-Mazraq camps (1–3) host around 24,000 internally displaced persons in Yemen.
* Camps for Syrian refugees in Iraqi Kurdistan, including Domiz in Dohuk Governorate, Arbat in Sulaymaniyah, and Qushtapa, Basirma, Gawilan, Kawergosk and Darashakran in Erbil Governorate. (see also Syrian refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan)
* Camps for Syrian refugees in Turkey, such as Urfa, Kilis Oncupinar, Gaziantep and those in the Hatay Province that were opened in 2011 (see also Syrian refugee camps in Turkey).
* Immigrant camps (Israel) (1947–1950) and Ma&#x27;abarot transition camps (1950–1963) to accommodate Jewish refugees and immigrants in Israel.
* Mrajeeb Al Fhood refugee camp in Jordan, hosting 4,200 and Azraq camp, hosting 26,000 Syrian refugees.
* Palestinian refugee camps were opened between 1948 and 1968. The 59 camps are recognized by the UNRWA and host 1.5  million refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Today the former camps were developed to towns. These towns contain the world&#x27;s largest and oldest refugee population. Yarmouk camp, just outside Damascus, is one of them and was once home to half a million Palestinian refugees (about 18,000 in 2015). It has been besieged by Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime in 2012 and came again under attack by the Islamic State group in 2015. 
* There are camps for displaced Syrians within Syria such as Qah or the Olive Tree Camp.
* Three camps received Palestinian refugees from Iraq: Al Tanf, Al Hol and Al Waleed. There are around 2,000 refugees in Al Hol and in Al Waleed camp, which is on the Iraqi side of the border. Al Tanf, which was on the Syrian side and hosted 1,600 Palestinians, was closed in 2010. An effort was made to close Al Tanf because the refugees&#x27; freedom of movement was severely restricted and the desert environment, with its sandstorms and extreme temperatures, was too harsh. Most of the refugees who lived there were resettled to third countries.
* Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, hosting 144,000 Syrian refugees as of July 2013, although the population in November 2013 had dropped to around 112,000 as the Syrian civil war continues.

===Europe===

* Lampedusa immigrant reception center for refugees, asylum seekers and other immigrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa.
* Moria, Oreokastro, Katsikas, Idomeni, and other camps on the Greek islands of Lesbos, Samos, and Chios have rapidly filled (up to 3–4 times more than their official capacity) with migrants fleeing violence in the Middle East and Africa. Since 2015, refugees fleeing conflict such as the Syrian Civil War have attempted to enter Europe but are often stopped in Greece, where they spend, on average, 8 months to a year in camps. Some camps have been destroyed or evacuated, including the evacuation of 4,000 residents from a camp on the island of Lesbos (capacity 1,500) from a tent fire that destroyed more than half the camp.

==Refugee camps by country and population==


==Criticism==

As head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband has advocated for abolishing refugee camps and the accompanying material aid altogether. He argues that given the long duration of many ongoing conflicts, refugees and local economies would be better off if refugees were settled in conventional housing and given work permits, with international financial support both for refugees and local government infrastructure and educational services.

== Unofficial refugee settlements ==

Within countries experiencing large refugee in-migrations, citizen volunteers, non-governmental organizations, and refugees themselves have developed short- and long-term alternatives to official refugee camps established by governments or the UNHCR. Informal camps provide physical shelter and direct service provision but also function as a form of political activism. Alternative forms of migrant settlement include squats, occupations and unofficial camps.

Asylum seekers who have been rejected and refugees without access to state services in Amsterdam worked with other migrants to create the &quot;We are here&quot; movement in 2012. The group set up tents on empty land and occupied empty buildings including a church, office spaces, a garage, and a former hospital. The purpose of these occupations was both for physical housing and to create space for political, cultural, and social communities and events.

In Brussels, Belgium, the speed of refugee processing and the lack of shelters in 2015 resulted in a large number of refugees sleeping in the streets. In response, a group of Belgian citizens and a collective of undocumented migrants built an informal camp in the Maximiliaan park in front of the Foreign Office and provided food, shelter, medical care, schooling, and activities such as a mobile cinema. This camp also functioned as a form of protest through its claims to space and visible location in front of government agencies.

The &quot;Jungle&quot; in Calais, France was an unofficial refugee camp, not legally approved by local or national French authorities. Because the camp did not receive support from the state government or international aid agencies, grassroots organizations were developed to manage food, donations, temporary shelters and toilets, and recreational activities within the camp. Most of the volunteers had not previously been involved in refugee aid work and were not professionals in humanitarian aid. Although filling a need for service provision, the volunteer nature of aid in informal camps resulted in a lack of accountability, reports of volunteers taking advantage of refugees, risks of violence towards volunteers, and a lack of capacity to handle complex situations within the camps such as trafficking, exploitation, and violence. However, volunteer work in the Calais Jungle also functioned as a form of civil disobedience, because working within the camp fell within the definition of Article L622-1 of the French Penal Code, known as the &quot;délit de solidarité&quot; (&quot;crime of solidarity&quot;), which made it illegal to assist the &quot;arrival, movement or residence of persons irregularly present on the French territory&quot;.

<text>Tito Lutwa Okello (15 October 1914 – 3 June 1996) was a Ugandan military officer and politician who served as the eighth president of Uganda from 29 July 1985 until 26 January 1986.

==Background==
Tito Okello was born into an ethnic Acholi family in circa 1914 in Namukora, Kitgum District.

He joined the King&#x27;s African Rifles in 1940 and served in the East African Campaign of World War II. As a career military officer, he had a variety of assignments.

As a follower of President Milton Obote, Okello went into exile following the 1971 coup d&#x27;état that resulted in Idi Amin becoming Uganda&#x27;s new ruler. In 1972, rebels invaded Uganda to restore Obote. Okello was one of the leaders of an insurgent group which targeted Masaka. The invasion was defeated by loyalist Uganda Army troops.

Okello took part in the Uganda–Tanzania War. He was one of the commanders in the coalition between the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force and the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) that removed Amin from power in 1979. In 1980, Obote was restored to presidency. Okello was selected to be the Commander of the UNLA from 1980 to 1985.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

In July 1985, together with Bazilio Olara-Okello, Tito Lutwa Okello staged the coup d&#x27;état that toppled President Obote. Okello ruled as president for six months until he had to transfer power to the National Resistance Army (NRA) operating under the leadership of the current president, Yoweri Museveni. He went into exile in Kenya after his tenure was forcefully terminated by Museveni.

==Extended family==
Tito Okello&#x27;s son Henry Oryem Okello is the current State Minister for Foreign Affairs responsible for International Affairs. In 2002, Tito Okello&#x27;s younger brother, Erisanweri Opira, was abducted from his home in Kitgum District by the rebel group, the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA). His abduction was considered unusual as the LRA usually kidnapped teenagers and young people to use as prospective soldiers or sex slaves. Opira was in his late seventies when he was abducted.

==Final years==
Okello remained in exile until 1993, when he was granted amnesty by President Museveni and returned to Kampala. He died three years later, of an undisclosed illness, on 3 June 1996. He was almost 82 years old at the time of his death. He was buried at his ancestral home in Kitgum District.

==Legacy and honours==
In January 2010, Okello was posthumously awarded the Kagera National Medal of Honour for fighting against the Idi Amin dictatorship in the 1970s.

<doc id="438060" wikidata="Q718778" url="?curid=438060" title="Qingming Festival">
<text>The Qingming Festival or Ching Ming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day in English (sometimes also called Chinese Memorial Day, Ancestors&#x27; Day, the Clear Brightness Festival, or the Pure Brightness Festival), is a traditional Chinese festival observed by ethnic Chinese in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. A celebration of spring, it falls on the first day of the fifth solar term (also called Qingming) of the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. This makes it the 15th day after the Spring Equinox, either 4, 5 or 6 April in a given year. During Qingming, Chinese families visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites and make ritual offerings to their ancestors. Offerings would typically include traditional food dishes and the burning of joss sticks and joss paper. The holiday recognizes the traditional reverence of one&#x27;s ancestors in Chinese culture.

The origins of the Qingming Festival go back more than 2500 years, although the observance has changed significantly. It became a public holiday in mainland China in 2008, where it is associated with the consumption of &quot;qingtuan&quot;, green dumplings made of glutinous rice and Chinese mugwort or barley grass.

In Taiwan, the public holiday was in the past observed on 5 April to honor the death of Chiang Kai-shek on that day in 1975, but with Chiang&#x27;s popularity waning, this convention is not being observed. A confection called &quot;caozaiguo&quot; or &quot;shuchuguo&quot;, made with Jersey cudweed, is consumed there.

A similar holiday is observed in the Ryukyu Islands, called &quot;Shīmī&quot; in the local language.

==Origin==

The festival originated from the Cold Food or Hanshi Festival which is said to commemorate Jie Zitui, a nobleman of the state of Jin (modern Shanxi) during the Spring and Autumn period. Amid the Li Ji Unrest, he followed his master Prince Chong&#x27;er in 655BC to exile among the Di tribes and around China. Supposedly, he once even cut flesh from his thigh to provide his lord with soup. In 636BC, Duke Mu of Qin invaded Jin and enthroned Chong&#x27;er as its duke, where he was generous in rewarding those who had helped him in his time of need. Owing either to his high-mindedness or to the duke&#x27;s neglect, however, Jie was long passed over. He finally retired to the forest around Mount Mian with his elderly mother. The duke went to the forest in but could not find them. He then ordered his men to set fire to the forest in order to force Jie out. When Jie and his mother were killed instead, the duke ordered that thenceforth no one should light a fire on the date of Jie&#x27;s death. The people of Shanxi subsequently revered Jie as an immortal and avoided lighting fires for as long as a month in the depths of winter, a practice so injurious to children and the elderly that the area&#x27;s rulers unsuccessfully attempted to ban it for centuries. A compromise finally developed where it was restricted to 3 days around the Qingming solar term in mid-spring.

The present importance of the holiday is credited to Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. Wealthy citizens in China were reportedly holding too many extravagant and ostentatiously expensive ceremonies in honor of their ancestors. In , Xuanzong sought to curb this practice by declaring that such respects could be formally paid only once a year, on Qingming.

==Observance==
Qingming Festival is when Chinese people traditionally visit ancestral tombs to sweep them. This tradition has been legislated by the Emperors who built majestic imperial tombstones for every dynasty. For thousands of years, the Chinese imperials, nobility, peasantry, and merchants alike have gathered together to remember the lives of the departed, to visit their tombstones to perform Confucian filial piety by tombsweeping, to visit burial grounds, graveyards or in modern urban cities, the city columbaria, to perform groundskeeping and maintenance and to commit to pray for their ancestors in the uniquely Chinese concept of the afterlife and to offer remembrances of their ancestors to living blood relatives, their kith and kin. In some places, people believe that sweeping the tomb is only allowed during this festival, as they believe the dead will get disturbed if the sweeping is done on other days.

The young and old alike kneel to offer prayers before tombstones of the ancestors, offer the burning of joss in both the forms of incense sticks (joss-sticks) and silver-leafed paper (joss paper), sweep the tombs and offer food in memory of the ancestors. Depending on the religion of the observers, some pray to a higher deity to honor their ancestors, while others may pray directly to the ancestral spirits.

People who live far away and can&#x27;t travel to their ancestors&#x27; tombs may make a sacrifice from a distance.

These rites have a long tradition in Asia, especially among the imperial who legislated these rituals into a national religion. They have been preserved especially by the peasantry and are most popular with farmers today, who believe that continued observances will ensure fruitful harvests ahead by appeasing the spirits in the other world.

Religious symbols of ritual purity, such as pomegranate and willow branches, are popular at this time. Some people wear willow twigs on their heads on Qingming or stick willow branches on their homes. There are similarities to palm leaves used on Palm Sundays in Christianity; both are religious rituals. Furthermore, the belief is that the willow branches will help ward off misfortune.

After gathering on Qingming to perform Confucian clan and family duties at the tombstones, graveyards, or columbaria, participants spend the rest of the day in clan or family outings, before they start the spring plowing. Historically, people would often sing and dance, and Qingming was a time when young couples traditionally started courting. Another popular thing to do is to fly kites in the shapes of animals or characters from folk tales or Chinese opera. Another common practice is to carry flowers instead of burning paper, incense, or firecrackers.

Traditionally, a family will burn spirit money (joss paper) and paper replicas of material goods such as cars, homes, phones, and paper servants. This action usually happens during the Qingming festival. In Chinese culture, it is believed that people still need all of those things in the afterlife. Then family members take turns to kowtow three to nine times (depending on the family&#x27;s adherence to traditional values) before the tomb of the ancestors. The Kowtowing ritual in front of the grave is performed in the order of patriarchal seniority within the family. After the ancestor worship at the grave site, the whole family or the whole clan feast on the food and drink they have brought for the worship. Another ritual related to the festival is the cockfight, as well as being available within that historic and cultural context at Kaifeng Millennium City Park (Qingming Riverside Landscape Garden).

The holiday is often marked by people paying respects to those who are considered national or legendary heroes. The April Fifth Movement and the Tiananmen Incident were major events in Chinese history which occurred on Qingming. After Premier Zhou Enlai died in 1976, thousands honored him during the festival to pay their respects.

In Taiwan, the Qingming Festival was not a public holiday until 1972. Three years later, upon the death of Chiang Kai-shek on 5 April 1975, the Kuomintang government declared that the anniversary of Chiang&#x27;s death be observed alongside the festival. The practice was abolished in 2007.

===Malaysia and Singapore===

Despite the festival having no official status, the overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asian nations, such as those in Singapore and Malaysia, take this festival seriously and observe its traditions faithfully. Some Qingming rituals and ancestral veneration decorum observed by the overseas Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore can be dated back to the Ming and Qing dynasties, as the overseas communities were not affected by the Cultural Revolution in mainland China. Qingming in Malaysia is an elaborate family function or a clan feast (usually organized by the respective clan association) to commemorate and honor recently deceased relatives at their grave sites and distant ancestors from China at home altars, clan temples, or makeshift altars in Buddhist or Taoist temples. For the overseas Chinese community, the Qingming festival is very much a solemn family event and, at the same time, a family obligation. They see this festival as a time of reflection for honoring and giving thanks to their forefathers. Overseas Chinese normally visit the graves of their recently deceased relatives on the weekend nearest to the actual date. According to the ancient custom, grave site veneration is only permissible ten days before and after the Qingming Festival. If the visit is not on the actual date, normally veneration before Qingming is encouraged. The Qingming Festival in Malaysia and Singapore normally starts early in the morning by paying respect to distant ancestors from China at home altars. This is followed by visiting the graves of close relatives in the country. Some follow the concept of filial piety to the extent of visiting the graves of their ancestors in mainland China.

==Other customs==
===Games===

During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang promoted large-scale tug of war games, using ropes of up to with shorter ropes attached and more than 500 people on each end of the rope. Each side also had its own team of drummers to encourage the participants. In honor of these customs, families often go hiking or kiting, play Chinese soccer or tug-of-war and plant trees, including willow trees.

===Buddhism===
The Qingming festival is also a part of spiritual and religious practices in China, and is associated with Buddhism. For example, Buddhism teaches that those who die with guilt are unable to eat in the afterlife, except on the day of the Qingming festival.

==Chinese tea culture==
The Qingming festival holiday has significance in the Chinese tea culture since this specific day divides the fresh green teas by their picking dates. Green teas made from leaves picked before this date are given the prestigious &#x27;pre-Qingming tea&#x27; () designation which commands a much higher price tag. These teas are prized for their aroma, taste, and tenderness.

===Weather===
The Qingming festival was originally considered the day with the best spring weather when many people would go out and travel. The Old Book of Tang describes this custom and mentions of it may be found in ancient poetry.

==In painting==
The famous Song dynasty &quot;Qingming scroll&quot; attributed to Zhang Zeduan may portray Kaifeng city, the capital of the Song dynasty, but does not include any of the activities associated with the holiday, however, and the term &quot;Qingming&quot; may not refer to the holiday.

==In literature==
Qingming was frequently mentioned in Chinese literature. Among these, the most famous one is probably Du Mu&#x27;s poem (simply titled &quot;Qingming&quot;):

Although the Qingming Festival is not celebrated in Vietnam, the Qingming Festival is mentioned (under the name &quot;Thanh Minh&quot;) in the epic poem &quot;The Tale of Kieu&quot; (which takes place in Ming China during the reign of Jiajing), when the protagonist Thúy Kiều () meets a ghost of a dead old lady. The description of the scenery during this festival is one of the best-known passages of Vietnamese literature:

<text>The National Resistance Army (NRA) was a guerilla army and the military wing of the National Resistance Movement (NRM) that fought in the Ugandan Bush War against the government of Milton Obote, and later the government of Tito Okello. NRA was supported by Muammar Gaddafi.

NRA was formed in 1981 when Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s Popular Resistance Army (PRA) merged with ex-president Yusuf Lule&#x27;s group, the Uganda Freedom Fighters (UFF). Museveni, then leader of the Uganda Patriotic Movement party, alleged electoral fraud and declared an armed rebellion, following the victory of Uganda Peoples Congress in the bitterly disputed 1980 general election.

Museveni, who had guerrilla war experience with the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) in Mozambique, and his own Front for National Salvation (FRONASA) formed in Tanzania to fight Idi Amin, led the NRA to victory against Ugandan government troops (UNLA) in 1986. By the time the victorious NRA entered Kampala in 1986, about a quarter of its 16,000 combatants were Banyarwanda, while Fred Rwigema was its deputy commander. The NRA then became the national army.

Shortly afterwards, the UNLA carried out a number of attacks against civilians in the north of Uganda. The attacks largely targeted the Acholi people and were in part seen as a form of revenge for Operation Bonanza, the scorched-earth operation there that had been ordered by Milton Obote during his presidency.

From 1986 to 1990, the Museveni regime tried to end various insurgencies and establish control over the army. Despite repeated government claims that the NRA had defeated the UNLA and other rebel groups, insurgent activity continued, especially in the northern, eastern, and western regions. In April 1988, 3,000 former Uganda People&#x27;s Army (UPA) fighters and members of several other small rebel groups accepted a government amnesty by surrendering and declaring their support for Museveni&#x27;s regime. In June 1988, the president concluded a peace agreement with Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army (UPDA) commander Lieutenant Colonel John Angelo Okello. Although the NRA subsequently integrated many UPA and UPDA personnel into its ranks, thousands of others rejected the peace accord and continued to fight against the NRA.

After the 1995 Ugandan constitution was enacted, the NRA was renamed the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force.

<text>Guilford College is a private liberal arts college in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was founded in 1837 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Guilford has both traditional students and students who attend its Center for Continuing Education (CCE).

Guilford&#x27;s program offerings include such majors as Peace and Conflict Studies and Community and Justice Studies, both rooted in the college&#x27;s history as a Quaker institution. Its campus has been considered a National Historic District by the United States Department of the Interior since 1990. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges but was placed on probation in 2023 due to severe, ongoing financial challenges.

==History==
Guilford College is the only Quaker-founded college in the southeastern United States and the first co-ed college in the South. Opening in 1837 as New Garden Boarding School, the institution became a four-year liberal arts college under its current name, Guilford College, in 1888. Levi Coffin, a well-known abolitionist, Quaker, and political dissenter grew up on the land, which is now considered a historical site. The woods of New Garden, which still exist on campus today, were used as a meeting point for the Underground Railroad in the 19th century, run by Coffin.

===2020s financial challenges===

Jane Fernandes, having served as president since 2014, chose to furlough and lay off colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic and announced that she would leave office on June 30, 2020, followed by a one-year sabbatical and transition to a tenured faculty position in English. Carol Moore was appointed the interim president and she began a &quot;program prioritization&quot; process that would significantly reduce the number of majors offered once approved. The college announced in November 2020 that it would likely discontinue 19 out of its 42 majors and cut 16 tenured professors. In November 2020, as a response to this plan, the faculty voted no confidence in Moore and the Board of Trustees&#x27; leadership, the first no-confidence vote in the college&#x27;s history. Moore subsequently left the college and Jim Hood, a faculty member, was selected as the new interim president at the end of February 2021.

In early 2021, the college paused the November 2020 layoff plans and began significant fundraising effort, placing a hold on the layoff question until after the spring semester. As of late March 2021, the fundraising plan was slightly ahead of schedule. On January 1, 2022, Kyle Farmbry became Guilford&#x27;s 10th president.

In late 2023, the college&#x27;s accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, placed the college on probation due to its ongoing, severe financial challenges. The probation was initially for one year but in late 2024 it was extended for another year. In December 2024, while the college was on probation, president Farmbry resigned and the college&#x27;s board of trustees appointed one of their own, Jean Parvin Bordewich, acting president.

==Athletics==
Guilford athletic teams are the Quakers. The college is a member at the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing as a member of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) since the 1988–89 academic year. The Quakers previously competed in the Carolinas Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIAC, now Conference Carolinas) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1930–31 to 1987–88.

Guilford competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, triathlon and volleyball.

===Accomplishments===
The school has won five national championships, including the NAIA men&#x27;s basketball championship in 1973, the 1981 NAIA women&#x27;s tennis title and the 1989 (NAIA), 2002 and 2005 (NCAA Division III) men&#x27;s golf titles.

==Campus events==
* Bryan Series: In the past decade, Guilford&#x27;s Bryan Series has brought many notable speakers to the campus and city for an annual public lecture series. Past speakers have included Desmond Tutu, Mikhail Gorbachev, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Ken Burns, Mary Robinson, David McCullough, Toni Morrison, and Venus Williams.
* Eastern Music Festival (EMF): Every summer, the college hosts the five-week-long Eastern Music Festival (EMF), where professional and student musicians come together for seminars and public performances. Each year, EMF features more than 70 concerts and music-related events on- and off-campus.
* Serendipity: The largest campus-wide event of the year is &quot;Serendipity&quot;, held annually in the spring. It began in 1972 as a replacement to the somewhat antiquated May Day festivities, and has featured games, musical performances, and &quot;general mayhem.&quot; During its peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the weekend festival was attended by Guilford students and alumni and thousands of students from other local institutions in the Triad area. Musical acts have included Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, Hootie &amp; The Blowfish, Common, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, Luscious Jackson, The Violent Femmes, Man Man, The Village People, and The Squirrel Nut Zippers.
* WTH?! Con: This event has occurred annually since 2001. Major guests include a host of webcomic creators and wrock bands. The 2018 event attracted around 300 attendees. Peak attendance has been around 500 people. The most recent con was held the weekend of March 15, 2019.

==Early College at Guilford==
The Early College at Guilford (ECG) has approximately 200 students and is located in Greensboro, North Carolina. The school was started in 2002 as a partnership between Guilford College and Guilford County Schools as the first early college high school in North Carolina, allowing students to graduate with a high school diploma and up to two years of college credit from Guilford College.

<doc id="438077" wikidata="Q892187" url="?curid=438077" title="Bond Street">
<text>Bond Street in the West End of London links Piccadilly in the south to Oxford Street in the north. Since the 18th century the street has housed many prestigious and upmarket fashion retailers. The southern section is Old Bond Street and the longer northern section New Bond Street, a distinction not generally made in everyday usage.

The street was built on fields surrounding Clarendon House on Piccadilly, which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond. It was built up in the 1720s, and by the end of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper-class residents of Mayfair to socialise. Prestigious or expensive shops were established along the street, but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century, although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail, and is home to the auction houses Sotheby&#x27;s and Bonhams (formerly Phillips) and the department store Fenwick and jeweller Tiffany&#x27;s. It is one of the most expensive and sought after strips of real estate in the world.

==Geography==
Bond Street links Oxford Street and Piccadilly. Old Bond Street is at the southern end between Piccadilly and Burlington Gardens. The northern section, New Bond Street, extends to Oxford Street. The entire street is around long. Many shop frontages are less than wide.

The nearest tube stations are Green Park on Piccadilly, and Bond Street station on Oxford Street. Bond Street station does not directly connect to either New or Old Bond Street. No buses use the street, although the 22 service crosses New Bond Street. Part of New Bond Street is numbered B406 but the remainder and all of Old Bond Street is unclassified. New Bond Street is pedestrianised between Grafton Street and Clifford Street to prevent through traffic and to stop the road being used as a rat run.

==History==

There is evidence of Roman settlement around what is now Bond Street. In 1894, a culvert made from brick and stone was discovered in the area. The street was named after Sir Thomas Bond, the head of a syndicate of developers who purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1686, and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time, the house backed onto open fields, known as Albemarle Ground, and the development of estates in Mayfair had just begun.

New Bond Street was laid out during the second phase of construction 14 years after Bond&#x27;s syndicate began developing the area. Most of the building along the street occurred in the 1720s, on what was the Conduit Mead Estate. John Rocque&#x27;s map of London, published in 1746, shows properties along the entire length of Bond Street, including the fully constructed side streets. The two parts of the street have always had separate names, and a plan by the council to merge the two into a singular &quot;Bond Street&quot; in the 1920s was rejected by locals.

During the 18th century, the street began to be popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for residential purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in Parliament, leading to the dissolution of the Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading up and down the street in a pretentious manner.
Lord Nelson stayed at temporary lodgings in New Bond Street between 1797 and 1798, as did his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton between 1811 and 1813. Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford lived in Bond Street and was unhappy about the presence of the Bond Street Loungers. Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801 he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the crowd with a pistol.

During the 19th century, Bond Street became less known for its social atmosphere but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No. 101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos. 165–169 New Bond Street. Opposite Asprey was the luxury luggage and trunk maker Finnigans, originally established in Manchester in 1830. The house of Finnigans opened their New Bond Street shop in 1879. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah has been associated with the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No. 50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.

The Royal Arcade links Old Bond Street with Albemarle Street. It was originally proposed in 1864 as a longer link between Old Bond Street and Regent Street, but this plan was rejected because of the scale of proposed demolition and reduced access to existing properties. It was subsequently redesigned in its current layout, opening in 1879 and replacing the Clarendon Hotel, which had been demolished in 1870.

The Grosvenor Gallery opened on New Bond Street in 1877 by Sir Coutts Lindsay. It cost over £100,000 to build and included a restaurant and library downstairs, and two exhibition rooms upstairs. A negative review by John Ruskin of exhibits by James McNeill Whistler led to Whistler suing Ruskin for libel, winning a farthing in compensation. This case was satirised in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot;, with the line, &quot;greenery-yallery, Grosvenor Gallery&quot;.

The street has maintained its reputation for luxury shopping into the 21st century, and has on occasion been regarded as the best retail location in Europe. In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that New Bond Street was the most expensive retail street in Europe after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. As a consequence, though, the street has many times suffered from armed robbery, as robbers are attracted by the high value of the goods. The Graff Diamonds robbery in Bond Street in 2009 resulted in an estimated loss of £40 million.

==Properties==

According to Westminster City Council, Bond Street has the highest density of haute couture stores anywhere in the world, attracting &quot;the rich, the famous, and the simply curious&quot;. The entire length of Bond Street has been part of the Mayfair Conservation Area controlled by Westminster City Council since 1969. Building alterations and constructions are tightly controlled to ensure the street&#x27;s appearance and upkeep are unaltered. Many buildings are listed. The council regulates the style and materials used on shop front advertising.

At one time, Bond Street was best known for top-end art dealers and antique shops that were clustered around the London office of Sotheby&#x27;s auction house, which has been at Nos. 34–35 Bond Street since 1917, and the Fine Art Society, founded in 1876. The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby&#x27;s is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around 1600 BC. It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London.

Some dealers and antique shops remain, but others are fashion boutiques or branches of global designer brands. The street still has a reputation as a fashionable place for shopping, including the flagship stores of Ralph Lauren and Cartier. Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891. The Phillips building at No. 101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30 million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.
The street features &quot;Allies&quot;, a statue of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who are portrayed sitting in conversation on a park bench, sculpted by Lawrence Holofcener. The statue, popular with tourists, was erected by the Bond Street Association to commemorate 50 years since the end of World War II, and was unveiled in May 1995 by Princess Margaret. In 2013, maquettes of the sculpture (which are replicas, as Holofcener did not make any as part of the original artwork or design) were sold at Bonhams. Henry Moore has four sculptures engraved into the building work of no.153 (a Loro Piana branch), which he subsequently attempted to buy back when he felt no one noticed them.

The construction of Crossrail, part of which runs between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations, involved demolition of property in nearby Hanover Square, some of which backs onto New Bond Street. This affected Nos. 64–72, which required refurbishment.

==Cultural references==
Bond Street has been mentioned in several works of literature, including Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and Virginia Woolf&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;. The plot of the 1948 film &quot;Bond Street&quot; is based on items purchased from shops in the street. In Susanna Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell&quot;, Bond Street is described as having &quot;the most fashionable shops in all the kingdom&quot;.

Bond Street is also a square on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board and is the most expensive of the green-coloured set that also includes Regent and Oxford Streets. The three streets are grouped together because of their shared retail history.

<text>Philip George Zimbardo (; March 23, 1933 – October 14, 2024) was an American psychologist and a professor at Stanford University. He was an internationally known educator, researcher, author and media personality in psychology who authored more than 500 articles, chapters, textbooks, and trade books covering a wide range of topics, including time perspective, cognitive dissonance, the psychology of evil, persuasion, cults, deindividuation, shyness, and heroism. He became known for his 1971 Stanford prison experiment, which was later criticized. He authored various widely-used, introductory psychology textbooks for college students, and other notable works, including &quot;Shyness&quot;, &quot;The Lucifer Effect&quot;, and &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;. He was the founder and president of the Heroic Imagination Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting heroism in everyday life by training people how to resist bullying, bystanding, and negative conformity. He pioneered The Stanford Shyness Clinic in the 1970s and offered the earliest comprehensive treatment program for shyness. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and many awards and honors for service, teaching, research, writing, and educational media, including the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science for his &quot;Discovering Psychology&quot; video series. He served as Western Psychological Association president in 1983 and 2001, and American Psychological Association president in 2002.

==Early life and education==
Zimbardo was born in New York City on March 23, 1933, to a second generation Sicilian-American immigrant family. Early in life he experienced discrimination and prejudice, growing up poor on welfare in the South Bronx, and being Italian. Zimbardo said these experiences early in life started his curiosity about people&#x27;s behavior, and later influenced his research in school.He survived an early childhood illness and the experience of a long stay at a hospital for children with contagious diseases, where he learned to read. His formal education began in New York Public School 52 and he graduated from James Monroe High School. He was the first member of his family to pursue a college degree.

In 1954, Zimbardo completed his B.A. with a triple major in Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology from Brooklyn College, where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. He completed his M.S. (1955) and Ph.D. (1959) in psychology from Yale University, where Neal E. Miller was his advisor. While at Yale, he married fellow graduate student Rose Abdelnour; they had a son in 1962 and divorced in 1971.

He taught at Yale from 1959 to 1960. From 1960 to 1967, he was a professor of psychology at New York University College of Arts &amp; Science. From 1967 to 1968, he taught at Columbia University. He joined the faculty at Stanford University in California in 1968 and taught for 50 years there. Following retirement in 2003, he continued to lecture at Stanford and taught at Palo Alto University (former Pacific Graduate School of Psychology) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey.

Zimbardo&#x27;s activism manifested in different ways, such as organizing academic forums called teach-ins on civil rights and racial justice. Dr. Zimbardo organized a walk-out at an NYU graduation ceremony to protest the decision to award an honorary degree to Robert McNamara, the U.S. Secretary of Defense at the time, whose involvement in escalating the Vietnam War made him a highly controversial figure.

In 1972 he married Christina Maslach, who received her doctorate in psychology at Stanford University in 1971 and had played a role in concluding the Stanford Prison Experiment. They had two children and were married for 52 years until his death.

== Death ==
Zimbardo died at home in San Francisco on October 14, 2024, at the age of 91. His wife, Christina Maslach, and their children were by his side when he died.

== Teaching and educational media ==
Philip G. Zimbardo was widely known for popular introductory psychology courses. For decades he authored numerous editions of the introductory psychology textbook &quot;Psychology and Life&quot; and co-authored &quot;Psychology: Core Concepts&quot;, which have been foundational for many American undergraduate psychology courses.

Throughout his career, he was committed to &quot;giving psychology away&quot; or making psychology accessible to the public, notably through his PBS television series titled &quot;Discovering Psychology,&quot; which is used in many college telecourses, and his many bestselling academic and popular publications. &quot;Discovering Psychology&quot; won an Emmy and awards from the American Psychological Association, the Western Psychological Association and Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival. He sought to bridge the gap between academia and the broader audience by using mass media to communicate his work. He collaborated with Allen Funt, the creator and host of the American hidden-camera show &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, to produce narrated educational videos that use classic episodes to illustrate key principles of psychology. These &quot;Candid Camera Classics&quot; programs were created for psychology classes and released on DVD, for use in both Introductory Psychology and Social Psychology courses. 

Zimbardo, who retired officially in 2003, gave his final lecture, &quot;Exploring Human Nature&quot;, on March 7, 2007, on the Stanford campus, celebrating his 50th year of teaching psychology. David Spiegel, professor of psychiatry at the Stanford University School of Medicine, termed Zimbardo &quot;a legendary teacher&quot;, saying that &quot;he has changed the way we think about social influences&quot;. Colleague Ewart Thomas, professor emeritus of psychology and former dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford, noted that Zimbardo was, “famous for inspiring many of his students to pursue research and teaching careers in which they, like their mentor, were recognized for their distinguished teaching.”

His teaching career was recognized with numerous awards, including Distinguished Teaching Award, New York University (1965), Distinguished Teaching Award for Outstanding Contributions to Education in Psychology, American Psychological Foundation (1975), Phoenix Award for Outstanding Teaching, Stanford Psychology Department Faculty (1984), &quot;California Magazine&quot;, Best Psychology Teacher in California (1986), The Walter Gores Distinguished Teaching Award, Stanford University (1990), Bing Fellow Outstanding Senior Faculty Teaching Award, Stanford University (1994-1997), Outstanding Teaching Award, Western Psychological Association (1995), Distinguished Teaching Award, Phi Beta Kappa (1998), Robert S. Daniel Teaching Excellence Award, APA Division 2, Society for the Teaching of Psychology (1999), and Dean’s Award for Distinguished Teaching, Stanford University (1999-2000).

== Research ==
Philip Zimbardo was a trailblazing psychologist known for his research in how individual behavior is shaped by social systems, situations and contexts. “Phil Zimbardo is one of the most prolific and influential psychologists of his generation – a true pioneer of the field of social psychology,” said Claude Steele, the Lucie Stern Professor in the Social Sciences and professor emeritus of psychology at Stanford, “Virtually all of Phil’s research shows how important phenomena of real-life human behavior can be studied scientifically. For a young science like social psychology, this has been an especially important contribution.” Zimbardo&#x27;s research spanned across multiple topics:

=== Attitude change and cognitive dissonance ===
Zimbardo undertook graduate school training in the Yale Attitude Change Program, headed by his mentor, Carl Hovland, an influential psychologist in his own right. This experience inspired a long term interest in the processes of attitude and behavior change produced by persuasion. Zimbardo’s work on dissonance began during graduate school and he wrote his dissertation on this topic after being introduced to Leon Festinger’s work by his Yale mentors in 1957. He conceptualized dissonance phenomena as the cognitive control of motivation, and demonstrated the power of this approach in a series of experimentally rigorous studies. This dissertation work was published in 1960 in the &quot;Journal of abnormal and social psychology.&quot; Among other publications on principles of behavior and attitude change, the book he co-authored with Michael Leippe, &quot;The Psychology of Attitude Change and Social Influence&quot;, part of the McGraw-Hill Series in Social Psychology, covered the relationships existing between social influence, attitude change and human behavior.

=== Mind control ===
His long-term research interests included cultic behavior. Zimbardo conceived of mind control as a phenomenon encompassing all the ways in which personal, social and institutional forces are exerted to induce compliance, conformity, belief, attitude, and value change in others. After working personally with several members of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple cult, who had escaped the suicide/massacre in the Guyana jungle in 1978, Zimbardo became fascinated with the uniquely intense psychological context and forces involved in cult recruitment, identification, and internalization, and how they could be resisted.

=== Psychology of evil ===

==== &quot;The Lucifer Effect&quot; ====
&quot;The Lucifer Effect&quot; was written in response to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse military scandal, which occurred during the United States&#x27; invasion of Iraq. With renewed global interest in how the lessons of the Stanford Prison Study illuminate parallel dynamics, Zimbardo posited that, in contrast to the U.S. military&#x27;s explanation of individual dispositional &quot;bad apples&quot;, this was a situational &quot;bad barrel&quot; that shaped soldiers&#x27; behavior. With regards to the events that occurred at the Abu Ghraib Detention Center, the defense team—including Gary Myers—argued that it was not the prison guards and interrogators that were at fault for the physical and mental abuse of detainees but the George W. Bush administration policies themselves. This however does not deny nor excuse individual accountability. In the book, Zimbardo says that humans cannot be defined as good or evil because we have the ability to act as both especially according to the situation. He believed that personality characteristics could play a role in how violent or submissive actions are manifested. According to Zimbardo, &quot;Good people can be induced, seduced, and initiated into behaving in evil ways. They can also be led to act in irrational, stupid, self-destructive, antisocial, and mindless ways when they are immersed in &#x27;total situations&#x27; that impact human nature in ways that challenge our sense of the stability and consistency of individual personality, of character, and of morality.&quot; In &quot;The Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, there are seven social processes that grease &quot;the slippery slope of evil&quot;:

* Mindlessly taking the first small step
* Dehumanization of others
* De-individuation of self (anonymity)
* Diffusion of personal responsibility
* Blind obedience to authority
* Uncritical conformity to group norms
* Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference
Philip Zimbardo&#x27;s research on the psychology of evil explores how situational and systemic factors can lead ordinary people to commit harmful or immoral acts, as demonstrated in studies on the dynamics of power, authority, conformity, dehumanization, and moral disengagement.

=== Stanford prison study ===
==== Background ====
In 1971, Zimbardo accepted a tenured position as professor of psychology at Stanford University. With a government grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research, he performed the Stanford prison experiment in which 24 male college students were selected (from an applicant pool of 75). After a mental health screening, the remaining men were assigned randomly to be &quot;prisoners&quot; or &quot;guards&quot; in a mock prison located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Prisoners were confined to a cell with black steel-barred doors. The only furniture in each cell was a cot. Solitary confinement was a small unlit closet. Zimbardo&#x27;s goal for the Stanford Prison study was to assess the psychological effect on a (randomly assigned) student of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. A 1997 article from the Stanford News Service described the experiment&#x27;s goals in more detail:

Zimbardo&#x27;s primary reason for conducting the experiment was to focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse ordinary individuals. &quot;I had been conducting research for some years on deindividuation, vandalism and dehumanization that illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways that made them less than human, as enemies or objects,&quot; Zimbardo told the Toronto symposium in the summer of 1996.

==== Experiment ====
Zimbardo himself participated with the study, playing the role of &quot;prison superintendent&quot; who could mediate disputes between guards and prisoners. He instructed guards to find ways to dominate the prisoners, not with physical violence, but with other tactics, such as sleep deprivation and punishment with solitary confinement. Later in the experiment, as some guards became more aggressive, taking away prisoners&#x27; cots (so that they had to sleep on the floor), and forcing them to use buckets kept in their cells as toilets, and then refusing permission to empty the buckets, neither the other guards nor Zimbardo himself intervened. Knowing that their actions were observed but not rebuked, guards considered that they had implicit approval for such actions.

In later interviews, several guards told interviewers that they knew what Zimbardo wanted to have happen, and they did their best to make that happen. Less than two full days into the study, one inmate pretended to suffer from depression, uncontrolled rage and other mental dysfunctions. The prisoner was eventually released after screaming and acting in an unstable manner in front of the other inmates. He revealed later that he faked this &quot;breakdown&quot; to get out of the study early. This prisoner was replaced with one of the alternates.

==== Results ====
By the end of the study, the guards had won complete control over all of their prisoners and were using their authority to its greatest extent. One prisoner had even gone as far as to begin a hunger strike. When he refused to eat, the guards put him into solitary confinement for three hours (even though their own rules stated the limit that a prisoner could be in solitary confinement was only one hour). Instead of the other prisoners considering this inmate as a hero and following along in his strike, they chanted together that he was a bad prisoner and a troublemaker. Prisoners and guards had adapted rapidly to their roles, doing more than had been predicted and resulting in dangerous and potentially psychologically damaging situations. Zimbardo himself started to give in to the roles of the situation. He had to be shown the reality of the study by Christina Maslach, his girlfriend and future wife, who had just received her doctorate in psychology. Zimbardo stated that the message from the study is that &quot;situations can have a more powerful influence over our behaviour than most people appreciate, and few people recognize [that].&quot;

At the end of the study, after all the prisoners had been released, everyone was brought back into the same room for evaluation and to be able to get their feelings out in the open towards one another.

==== Criticisms ====
Ethical concerns about the study often compare it to the Milgram experiment, which was performed in 1961 at Yale University by Stanley Milgram, Zimbardo&#x27;s former high school friend.

More recently, Thibault Le Texier of the University of Nice has examined the archives of the experiment, including videos, recordings, and Zimbardo&#x27;s handwritten notes, and argued that &quot;The guards knew what results the experiment was supposed to produce ... Far from reacting spontaneously to this pathogenic social environment, the guards were given clear instructions for how to create it ... The experimenters intervened directly in the experiment, either to give precise instructions, to recall the purposes of the experiment, or to set a general direction ... In order to get their full participation, Zimbardo intended to make the guards believe that they were his research assistants.&quot; Since his original publication in French, Le Texier&#x27;s accusations have been examined by science communicators in the United States. In his book &quot;Humankind – a hopeful history&quot; (2020) historian Rutger Bregman discusses charges that the whole experiment was faked and fraudulent; Bregman argued this experiment is often used as an example to show that people succumb easily to evil behavior, but Zimbardo was less than candid about the fact that he told the guards to act the way they did. More recently, an American Psychological Association (APA) psychology article reviewed this work in detail and concluded that Zimbardo encouraged the guards to act the way they did, so rather than this behavior appearing on its own, it was generated by Zimbardo.

In response to critics, Zimbardo asserted that none of the criticisms provide substantial evidence that undermines the main conclusion of the Stanford Prison Experiment—namely, the importance of understanding how systemic and situational forces can influence individual behavior, often without our awareness. He emphasized that the core message of the SPE is not to equate a psychological simulation of prison life with reality, nor to claim that prisoners and guards always or typically behave as they did in the experiment, but instead, the SPE serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of underestimating how social roles and external pressures can shape our actions. Zimbardo highlighted the lessons gained from the experience and his advocacy for stronger ethical standards in research.

==== Testimony at Trial of Abu Ghraib Prison Guards ====
Zimbardo discussed the similarities between the behavior of the participants in the Stanford prison experiment, and the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. He did not accept the claim of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Myers that the events were due to a few rogue soldiers and that it did not represent the military. Instead he considered the situation that the soldiers were in and considered the possibility that this situation might have induced the behavior that they displayed. He began with the assumption that the abusers were not &quot;bad apples&quot; and were in a situation like that of the Stanford prison study, where physically and psychologically healthy people were behaving sadistically and brutalizing prisoners. Zimbardo became absorbed in trying to understand who these people were, asking the question &quot;are they inexplicable, can we not understand them&quot;.

In 2004, Zimbardo testified for the defense during the court martial of Sgt. Ivan &quot;Chip&quot; Frederick, a guard at Abu Ghraib prison. He argued that Frederick&#x27;s sentence should be lessened due to mitigating circumstances, explaining that few individuals can resist the powerful situational pressures of a prison, particularly without proper training and supervision. The judge apparently disregarded Zimbardo&#x27;s testimony, and gave Frederick the maximum 8-year sentence. Zimbardo drew on the knowledge he gained from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book entitled &quot;The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil&quot;, about the connections between Abu Ghraib and the prison experiments.

=== Shyness ===
After the prison study, Zimbardo decided to search for ways he could use psychology to help people; this resulted in the founding of The Shyness Clinic in Menlo Park, California, to treat shy behavior in adults and children. It was later moved to the community of Palo Alto, California. The clinic follows a &quot;social fitness model&quot;, which encourages people to exercise socially.

Zimbardo&#x27;s research on shyness resulted in two bestselling books on the topic, &quot;Shyness: What It Is, What To Do About It&quot;, and &quot;The Shy Child&quot;, co-authored with Shirley Radl.

=== Discontinuity theory ===
Zimbardo was intrigued by the question of how people who are functioning normally and effectively first begin to develop the symptoms of psychopathology. He was interested in understanding when, why, and how those experiences may eventually lead to psychiatric diagnosis. Using hypnosis as an experimental tool, he focused on the way that individuals experience significant “discontinuities”  in their lives, and how these events can trigger a search for understanding (to be rational) and/or a search for social comparison with comparable others (to be normal).

=== Time perspective ===

==== &quot;Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory&quot; ====
In 2008, Zimbardo published his work with John Boyd about Time Perspective Theory and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) in &quot;The Time Paradox: The New Psychology of Time That Will Change Your Life&quot;. In 2009, he met Richard Sword and started collaborating to convert the Time Perspective Theory into a clinical therapy, beginning a four-year long pilot study and establishing time perspective therapy. In 2009, Zimbardo did his Ted Talk &quot;The Psychology of Time&quot; about the Time Perspective Theory. According to this Ted Talk, there are six kinds of different Time Perspectives which are Past Positive TP (Time Perspective), Past Negative TP, Present Hedonism TP, Present Fatalism TP, Future Life Goal-Oriented TP and Future Transcendental TP. In 2012, Zimbardo, Richard Sword, and his wife Rosemary authored a book named &quot;The Time Cure.&quot; Time Perspective therapy bears similarities to Pause Button Therapy, developed by psychotherapist Martin Shirran, whom Zimbardo corresponded with and met at the first International Time Perspective Conference at the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Zimbardo wrote the foreword to the second edition of Shirran&#x27;s book on the subject.

=== Heroism ===
After decades of researching the psychology of evil and social factors that make the majority conform to unethical behavior, Zimbardo devoted the latter part of his life to researching and promoting the psychology of heroism, including topics on disobedience to unjust authority, the phenomenon of whistle-blowers, and challenging the bystander effect. Zimbardo&#x27;s contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. His last article with &quot;Greater Good&quot;, &quot;The Banality of Heroism&quot;, examined how ordinary people can become everyday heroes. In February 2010, Zimbardo was a guest presenter at the Science of a Meaningful Life seminar: Goodness, Evil, and Everyday Heroism, along with Greater Good Science Center Executive Director Dacher Keltner.

Zimbardo worked as an advisor to the anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution and appeared in the organization&#x27;s videos to explain the bystander effect and discuss the evil of inaction.

==== Heroic Imagination Project ====
Zimbardo was the founder and director of the Heroic Imagination Project (HIP), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting heroism in everyday life. Since 2010, HIP has been focused on educational programs across the United States and globally in Hungary, Poland, Indonesia, Portugal and Italy, to teach people how to resist behaviors such as bullying, bystander effect, and negative conformity and to encourage positive social action. The concept of the &quot;banality of heroism,&quot; introduced by Dr. Zimbardo and Dr. Zeno Franco in 2006, serves as a guiding principle for the Heroic Imagination Project, emphasizing the belief that fostering a culture of heroism can empower individuals to act positively and make impactful changes in their communities. Zimbardo published an article contrasting heroism and altruism in 2011 with Zeno Franco and Kathy Blau in the &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot;.

The Heroesʼ Square Initiative, Hösök Tere, founded in 2013 by Györgyi Orosz, Péter Halácsy and Philip Zimbardo, was designed to identify and provide tools to overcome the beliefs that prevent people from standing up for others – or even ourselves. The mission of the Heroesʼ Square Foundation and Heroesʼ Square Company is to provide the tools for people to think critically, dare to stand up and do for others, and act as everyday heroes.

The Heroic Imagination Project has been in collaboration and mentorship with Giocherenda, an organization created by young migrants from Guinea, Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Morocco. Their use of creative games and HIP curriculum focuses on transforming divisive narratives, engaging in emancipatory storytelling, and fostering cooperation. &quot;Giocherenda&quot;, which sounds like the Italian word &quot;giocare&quot; (to play), comes from &quot;Pulaar&quot; (a West African language) and it means “solidarity, awareness of interdependence, strength through sharing, the joy of doing things together”.

In Portugal the Heroic Imagination Project is being implemented by the Look Around Association, with the impact evaluation being led by the Center for Research on Human Development of the Catholic University of Porto. In 2018 HIP Portugal team implemented a pilot study of a version of HIP curriculum for adolescents – HIP Teens. In 2020, the program ‘First Psychological Aid for Heroes’ was created in partnership with the Portuguese Red Cross, combining and adaptation of HIP curriculum for kids, along with their training of psychological first aid. The first HIP Club was created in 2023, following the implementation of the HIP Teens program in the social center Centro Social da Paróquia de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda. Its aim is to give young people a voice, enabling them to actively contribute to transforming their reality. The HIP Club serves as a space where youngsters identify issues they would like to change in their surroundings (in the community center, school, neighborhood, etc.), and actively contribute to solving them.

=== Social Intensity Syndrome (SIS) ===
In 2008, Zimbardo began working with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory termed Social Intensity Syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term invented to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency, and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization.

== Recognition ==
In 2002, Zimbardo received the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science, awarded by Council of Scientific Society Presidents. In 2005, he was honored for lifetime of research contributions to knowledge with the Havel Foundation Vision 97 Award, the foundation of former Czech president Vaclav Havel and his wife Dagmar, which presents an award for outstanding work in the world of science. The American Psychological Association awarded Zimbardo with an award for Distinguished Contributions in the Public Interest (2008), Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology (2012), Kurt Lewin award, for “outstanding contributions to the development and integration of psychological research and social action” (2015), and the Presidential Citation for international achievements (2023). In 2010, he received three Lifetime Achievement Awards, form Brooklyn College, the Western Psychological Association, and Society of Personality and Social Psychology. In 2012, Zimbardo received the American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement in the Science of Psychology. In 2003, Zimbardo and University of Rome La Sapienza scholars Gian Vittorio Caprara and Claudio Barbaranelli were awarded the sarcastic Ig Nobel Prize for Psychology for their report &quot;Politicians&#x27; Uniquely Simple Personalities&quot;. He received honorary degrees from the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology (1996), National University of San Martin, Peru (1996), Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece (1998), Webster University, Vienna (2007), Brooklyn College, New York (2008), Rutgers University, New Jersey (2009), Lund University, Lund, Sweden (2009), Loyola University, Chicago (2010), SWPS University in Warsaw (2011), University of Puget Sound (2013), Chapman University (2014), and Charles University, Prague (2016).

==Books==
Dr. Zimbardo authored dozens of textbooks and trade books on his research topics, many of which have been reprinted and translated into multiple languages.

&quot;Psychology And Life&quot;, the long-running, classic, introductory psychology textbook for college students, was co-authored by Philip Zimbardo for decades, beginning in its 8th edition with Floyd Ruch, through its 19th edition with Richard Gerrig. It has been translated into many languages for global use.

&quot;Psychology: Core Concepts&quot; another introductory psychology textbook used for many American college undergraduate psychology courses was co-authored by Philip Zimbardo and has been translated into various languages for international education.

&quot;Shyness: What It is, What to Do About It&quot; was a bestselling book, exploring shyness with a deep understanding of the emotions at play. It offers practical advice, exercises, and motivational support to help shy individuals improve their social skills and boost their self-confidence. It was a highly impactful book, often referenced in psychological literature and widely read by individuals seeking help with social anxiety and shyness. This was followed by &quot;The Shy Child,&quot; co-authored with Shirley Radl in 1981.

&quot;The Lucifer Effect&quot;, Zimbardo&#x27;s firsthand account of the 1971 Stanford prison experiment (SPE), was the William James Book Award winner in psychology in 2008, and was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Non-Fiction Best Seller list.

&quot;The Time Paradox: The New Psychology That Will Change Your Life&quot; (2008, with Boyd, J.) is one of Zimbardo&#x27;s notable works, where he draws on thirty years of research to reveal how an individual&#x27;s time perspective shapes one&#x27;s life.

&quot;The Time Cure: Overcoming PTSD with the New Psychology of Time Perspective Therapy&quot; (2012, with Sword, R. and Sword, R.K.M.) Dr. Zimbardo offers an approach using The Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) for those suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder.

In 2015, Zimbardo co-authored a book, &quot;Man (Dis)connected: How Technology Has Sabotaged What It Means To Be Male&quot;, which collected research to support a thesis that males are increasingly disconnected from society. He warned against the impacts of video game addiction and pornography addiction.

== Charity and other endeavors ==
Zimbardo’s early commitment to social change took shape in initiatives like the Harlem Summer Project, which provided educational opportunities for disadvantaged children.

From 2003 on, Zimbardo was active in charitable and economic work in rural Sicily through the Zimbardo-Luczo Fund with Steve Luczo and the local director , which provides scholarships for academically gifted students from Corleone and Cammarata.

The Zimbardo Center in Nikiszowiec was established in 2014 by the Local Initiatives Factory Association, primarily as a place to support local youth. It has become one of the most important points on the map of Nikiszowiec, where social and cultural events are organized as a place of positive change.

<doc id="438083" wikidata="Q51754" url="?curid=438083" title="Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)">
<text>Elias Boudinot (; 1802June 22, 1839; also known as Buck Watie) was a writer, newspaper editor, and leader of the Cherokee Nation. He was a member of a prominent family, and was born and grew up in Cherokee territory, now part of present-day Georgia. Born to parents of mixed Cherokee and European ancestry and educated at the Foreign Mission School in Connecticut, he became one of several leaders who believed that acculturation was critical to Cherokee survival. He was influential in the period of removal to Indian Territory.

In 1826, Boudinot had married Harriet R. Gold, the daughter of a prominent New England family in Cornwall, Connecticut. He met her while a student at the FMS in town. Following his cousin John Ridge&#x27;s marriage to a local woman there in 1825, Boudinot&#x27;s marriage was controversial and opposed by many townspeople. But to protect their future children, the Cherokee National Council had passed a law in 1825 enabling the descendants of Cherokee fathers and white mothers to be full citizens of the Cherokee. (Formerly, they had no official place in the matrilineal tribe, as children belong to their mother&#x27;s clan and people, and the white women were outsiders.) The Boudinots returned to Cherokee homelands (now in Georgia) to live at New Echota. They reared their six children as Cherokee.

Boudinot, with numerous other leading Cherokee, particularly those who had been educated outside the tribe, believed that removal was inevitable in the face of the numbers of United States settlers encroaching on their lands. He and several allies signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1835, hoping to gain the best conditions for their people. Cession of communal lands was adamantly opposed by John Ross, the Principal Chief, and the full-blood members of tribe, who comprised the majority. The following year, the tribe was forced to cede most of its lands in the Southeast, and remove to west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory in the late 1830s.

After Harriet died in 1836, Boudinot moved with his children to Indian Territory. After Removal, in June 1839 he and three other Treaty Party leaders were assassinated there by members of the Ross faction, known as the National Party. The orphaned Boudinot children were sent to be raised by his parents-in-law in Cornwall, Connecticut, which was believed more safe. They attended school there. After Boudinot&#x27;s son E. C. was educated, he returned west, settling in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He became an attorney and active in tribal and Democratic Party politics. He represented the Cherokee Nation in the Confederate Congress as a non-voting delegate.

Boudinot appears as a character in Unto These Hills, an outdoor drama that has been performed in Cherokee, NC since 1950. 

==Early life and education==
&quot;Gallegina&quot; was born in 1802 into a leading Cherokee family in their territory. (It is now present-day Georgia.) He was the eldest son of nine children of Uwati and Susanna Reese, who was of mixed Cherokee and European ancestry. When Uwati converted to Christianity, Boudinot took the name of David Uwatie (later he dropped the &quot;u&quot; from his name.) Gallegina&#x27;s younger brothers were &quot;Degataga&quot;, better known as Stand Watie, who served with the Confederate Army during the American Civil War and served as Principal Chief (1862-1866); and Thomas Watie. They were the nephews of Major Ridge and cousins of John Ridge.

Gallegina Watie, the Ridges, John Ross, and Charles R. Hicks and his son Elijah Hicks, came to form the ruling elite of the Cherokee Nation in the early nineteenth century. All were of mixed race and had some European-American education; the tribal chiefs had worked to prepare these young men to deal with the United States and its representatives.

Gallegina&#x27;s Christian education began in 1808, at the age of 6, when Boudinot studied at the local Moravian missionary school. In 1812, he joined the Spring Place school, in what is now Murray County. Around this time, Cherokee leaders were petitioning the government for aid to educate their children, as they wanted to learn aspects of white civilization.

Elias Cornelius, an agent from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), came to the community and served to support local education and recruit older students to study in the North. In 1817, the ABCFM opened the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut for educating promising students from foreign, non-Christian cultures, as well as Native American cultures. In 1818, Cornelius selected Gallegina Watie, John Ridge, and a few others to go to the Foreign Mission School. On the journey there, they were introduced to Virginia statesmen Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe.

In Burlington, New Jersey, the young men met Elias Boudinot, president of the American Bible Society and a former member and president of the Second Continental Congress. He and Watie impressed each other, and Watie asked Boudinot for permission to use his name, which he gave. When enrolled at the Foreign Mission School, Watie started using the name Elias Boudinot, which he kept for the rest of his life.

In 1820, Boudinot officially converted to Christianity, attracted to its message of universal love. His Christian belief informed his later work with the Cherokee Nation. In 1824, Boudinot collaborated with others in translating the New Testament into Cherokee and having it printed in the syllabary created by Sequoyah.

==Marriage and family==
While studying in Connecticut, Boudinot met Harriet Ruggles Gold, the daughter of a prominent local family who supported the Foreign Mission School. Her family often invited Boudinot and other Native American students to their home. After Boudinot returned to Cherokee Nation because of illness, he courted Harriet by letter.

His cousin John Ridge also attended the school and in 1824 married a local young woman. This caused considerable controversy in Cornwall, as many townspeople opposed the marriage. After the Ridges&#x27; return to New Echota to live, in 1825 the National Council passed a law providing full Cherokee citizenship to children of a Cherokee father and white mother.

In the Cherokee matrilineal kinship culture, children traditionally belonged to the mother&#x27;s clan and took their status from her people. The Cherokee had long absorbed the mixed-race children of Cherokee mothers and white fathers (usually fur traders). But, the children of Ridge and Boudinot would have had no place in the Cherokee society without the Council&#x27;s new law, as white women were outsiders and their children would not be considered Cherokee. Historian Theresa Strouth Gaul wrote that the law was inspired by Ridge&#x27;s marriage and Boudinot&#x27;s engagement; as the young men were elite Cherokee, it protected the status of their future children.

When Boudinot and Gold first announced their engagement, it was strongly opposed by her family and the Congregational Church. There were also local protests. Gold persisted and finally gained her parents&#x27; permission. The couple were married on 28 March 1826 at her home. Local hostility to the marriage, the second between a Cherokee student and a white woman, forced the closing of the Foreign Mission School.

The Boudinots returned to New Echota to live. They had six surviving children: Eleanor Susan; Mary Harriett; William Penn; Sarah Parkhill, Elias Cornelius; and Franklin Brinsmade. Five of the children later married and had families of their own.

Harriet Boudinot died in August 1836, likely of complications from childbirth; she died some months after her seventh child was stillborn.

==Career as editor==
After his return to New Echota, in 1828 Boudinot was selected by the General Council of the Cherokee as editor for a newspaper, the first to be published by a Native American nation. He worked with a new friend Samuel Worcester, a missionary and printer. Worcester had new type created and cast for the new forms of the Cherokee syllabary. In 1828, the two printed the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; in Cherokee and English. While planned as a bi-lingual newspaper, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; published most of its articles in English; under Boudinot, about 16 percent of the content was published in Cherokee.

The journalist Ann Lackey Landini believes that Boudinot emphasized English in the newspaper because the Cherokee Nation intended it to be a means to explain their people to European Americans and prove they had an admirable civilization. At the same time, the Council intended it to unite the Cherokee through the Southeast. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; regularly published new laws and other national Cherokee political information in the paper.

Between 1828 and 1832, Boudinot wrote numerous editorials arguing against removal, as proposed by Georgia and supported by President Andrew Jackson. After Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, federal pressure on the Cherokee increased. Jackson supported removal of the Cherokee and other Southeastern peoples from their eastern homelands to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi in order to make land available for European-American development. Over a roughly four-year period, Boudinot&#x27;s editorials emphasized that Georgia&#x27;s disregard of the Constitution and past federal treaties with the Cherokee would not only hurt Cherokee progress in acculturating, but threatened the fabric of the Union. Boudinot&#x27;s articles recounted the elements of Cherokee assimilation (conversion to Christianity, an increasingly Western-educated population, and a turn toward lives as herdsmen and farmers, etc.) He criticized the &quot;easy&quot; way in which treaty language was distorted by Indian Removal advocates for their own purposes.

In 1832, while on a speaking tour of the North to raise funds for the &quot;Phoenix,&quot; Boudinot learned that, in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia,&quot; the US Supreme Court had sustained the Cherokee rights to political and territorial sovereignty within Georgia&#x27;s borders. He soon learned that President Jackson still supported Indian Removal. In this context, Boudinot began advocating for his people to secure the best possible terms with the US by making a binding treaty of removal, as he believed it was inevitable. His changed position was widely opposed by the Cherokee.

The National Council and John Ross, the Principal Chief, opposed removal, as did the majority of the people. Former allies in the Cherokee government turned against Boudinot and other &quot;treaty advocates,&quot; who included John Ridge and Major Ridge. Opponents attacked the men&#x27;s loyalty and prevented their speaking in councils. Ross denounced Boudinot&#x27;s &quot;toleration of diversified views in the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; and forbade Boudinot from discussing pro-removal arguments in the paper. In protest, Boudinot resigned in the spring of 1832. Ross&#x27; brother-in-law, Elijah Hicks, replaced Boudinot as editor.

In 1959, he was inducted into the Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame in recognition of his newspaper work.

==Literary works==

===&quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot;===
The first newspaper published by a Native American tribe gave a &quot;voice to the American insiders&quot; who had been forced to become &quot;outsiders&quot;. The premier edition of the newspaper was called the &quot;Tsalagi Tsu-le-hi-sa-nu-hi&quot;; it was printed on 21 February 1828. The &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; office regularly received correspondence from about 100 other newspapers, published far and wide, because it was so respected throughout the United States and Europe. In 1829, the second edition of the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; was named the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix and Indians’ Advocate,&quot; indicating Boudinot&#x27;s ambition to influence people outside the tribe. Boudinot regularly wrote editorials related to Indian Removal.

===&quot;An Address to the Whites&quot; (1826)===
Boudinot delivered this speech in the First Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia on May 26, 1826. He described the similarities between the Cherokee and the whites, and ways in which the Cherokee were adopting aspects of white culture. Boudinot was fundraising for a Cherokee national academy and printing equipment for the newspaper, support for &quot;civilizing&quot; the Cherokee. Following the speech, he published his speech in a pamphlet by the same title. &quot;An Address to the Whites&quot; was well received and &quot;proved to be remarkably effective at fund-raising&quot;.

==Influence on Indian Removal==
The Indian removal policy was a result of the discovery of gold in Cherokee territory, the growth of the cotton industry, and the relentless European-American desire for land in the Southeast. European Americans resented Cherokee control of their lands, and conflicts increasingly arose. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 called for all Indian peoples living east of the Mississippi River to be removed and sent west beyond the river. While the majority of the Cherokee led by Chief John Ross opposed the act, Boudinot began to believe that Indian Removal was inevitable. He thought the best outcome was for the Cherokee to secure their rights through treaty, before they were moved against their will. Boudinot used all of his writing and oratory skills to influence Indian Removal policy, but many within the nation opposed his viewpoint. He criticized the popular principal chief John Ross, who opposed his ideas. Ross had ordered Boudinot to stop publishing his views favoring removal in the newspaper.

In 1832, Boudinot resigned as editor of the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix,&quot; giving his reasons his inadequate salary, personal health problems, and the inability of the Cherokee Nation to provide sufficient supplies to run a national newspaper. However, in a letter to John Ross, he indicated that he could no longer serve because he was unable to print what he believed to be true about the dangers to the people from continuing to oppose removal. Ross and the council accepted the resignation and appointed Elijah Hicks to run the newspaper. Although Hicks was a good businessman he had no newspaper experience. The &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; soon declined and ceased publication on 31 May 1834.

==Removal to Indian Territory==
Boudinot and Treaty Party leaders signed the Treaty of New Echota (1835) in New Echota, Cherokee Nation (now Calhoun, Georgia) ceding all Cherokee land east of the Mississippi River. Although this was opposed by the majority of the delegation and lacked the signature of the Principal Chief John Ross, the US Senate ratified the treaty. Afterward, faced with open enmity among the Cherokee, many of the signatories and their families migrated to Indian Territory, where they located with the &quot;Old Settlers&quot;, who had gone there in the 1820s.

During 1838 and 1839, the US Army enforced the Removal Act and evicted the Cherokee and their slaves from their homes in the Southeast. They forced most of them west into Indian Territory (in eastern present-day Oklahoma). The Cherokee referred to their journey as the Trail of Tears.

After his wife&#x27;s death in 1836, Boudinot needed to relocate both himself and the children. He sent their son, Cornelius, to live with a family in Huntsville, Alabama, where he could be treated for his condition by a doctor. Another son traveled west with the Ridge family. The rest of the children were enrolled in school at Brainerd, where they could stay when Elias left the territory. Elias himself first went north to visit Harriet&#x27;s parents. After that, he joined a group that included John Ridge and traveled to the Western Cherokee Nation, it was established by &quot;Old Settlers&quot; in the northeast quarter of what is today Oklahoma. Two months later he wrote to Harriet&#x27;s parents that he had married Delight Sargent, a New England woman who had been a teacher at New Echota. Impoverished, he received $500 from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (thanks to persuasive argument from Samuel Worcester) to build a modest house a quarter mile from the Worcesters in Park Hill. Reunited with his longtime friend, Boudinot returned to his vocation as a translator of the Gospel.

The &quot;Old Settlers&quot; and John Ross&#x27; supporters failed to agree on unification following the Nation&#x27;s removal to Indian Territory. Some Ross supporters met secretly to plan assassinations of Treaty Party leaders over the hardships of the Removal and to eliminate them as political rivals in a way which would intimidate the Old Settlers into submission. On June 22, 1839, a group of unknown Cherokee assassinated Boudinot outside his home. They killed his cousin and uncle, John and Major Ridge, the same day. His brother Stand Watie was attacked but survived.

Though Ross denied any connection to the killings, Stand Watie blamed the Principal Chief. After these murders followers of Watie and Ross engaged for years in violent conflict and retaliation. Watie killed a man whom he had seen attack his uncle Major Ridge; he was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. At his trial, he was represented by his nephew, E. C. Boudinot. He had become a lawyer in Arkansas after having been raised by his mother&#x27;s family and educated in the East following his father&#x27;s assassination.

The violence lasted into 1846, when the US negotiated a tenuous peace treaty. The deep bitterness contributed to tribal divisions during the American Civil War. The post-removal factionalism and violence compounded the misfortune of the Cherokee Nation.

During the Civil War, the Nation split into two factions. Stand Watie and his supporters, the majority of the Nation, sided with the Confederacy (he served as an officer in their army, along with other Cherokee.) Ross and his supporters sided with the Union. Many Union people had to leave Indian Territory during the war for their own safety. They returned after the Union victory, and Ross was the only chief recognized by the US.

<doc id="438085" wikidata="Q5360472" url="?curid=438085" title="Elias Cornelius Boudinot">
<text>Elias Cornelius Boudinot (August 1, 1835September 27, 1890) was an American politician, lawyer, newspaper editor, and co-founder of the &quot;Arkansan&quot; who served as the delegate to the Confederate States House of Representatives representing the Cherokee Nation. Prior to this he served as an officer of the Confederate States Army in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. He was the first Native American lawyer permitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.

He was the mixed-race son of Elias and Harriet Ruggles (née Gold) Boudinot, who was from Connecticut. His father was editor of the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix,&quot; the first Native American newspaper, which was published in Cherokee and English. In 1839 his father and three other leaders were assassinated by opponents in the tribe as retaliation for having ceded their homeland in the 1835 Treaty of New Echota. The Boudinot children were orphaned by their father&#x27;s murder, as their mother had died in 1836. They were sent for their safety to their mother&#x27;s family in Connecticut, where they were educated. 

Following the Civil War, Boudinot participated in negotiations of the Southern Cherokee with the United States before the tribe was reunited; he was part of the Cherokee delegation to the US. In 1868 he and his uncle Stand Watie opened a tobacco factory, to take advantage of provisions under the nation&#x27;s new 1866 treaty with the United States. It was confiscated for non-payment of taxes, and their case went to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled against them. Boudinot began to lobby for Native Americans to be granted United States citizenship in order to be protected by the Constitution.

He was active in politics and society in the Indian Territory and Washington, D.C., supporting construction of railroads in the territory. Boudinot also worked for two Arkansas politicians. He supported proposals for termination of Cherokee sovereignty and the allotment of communal land to tribal members, as was passed under the Dawes Act. As this would extinguish tribal land rights, Boudinot also worked to establish the state of Oklahoma and have it admitted to the Union. In his 2011 history of America&#x27;s transcontinental railroads, historian Richard White writes of Boudinot: &quot;[He] became a willing tool of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad... If the competition were not so stiff, Boudinot might be ranked among the great scoundrels of the Gilded Age.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Born August 1, 1835, at New Echota, Cherokee Nation (present-day Gordon County, Georgia); Elias Cornelius Boudinot was the son of Elias, a Cherokee National leader, and his wife Harriet Ruggles (née Gold) Boudinot (1805–1836), a young woman of English-American descent from a prominent family in Cornwall, Connecticut. They had met there when his father was a student at a local school for Native Americans. The senior Elias Boudinot became editor of the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; from 1828-1832; it was the first newspaper founded by a Native American nation and published in their language. He published articles in English and Cherokee, and had type cast for the syllabary created by Sequoyah. The newspaper was distributed across the United States and internationally.

His parents named this son Elias Cornelius Boudinot, after the missionary Elias Cornelius, who had selected his father to attend the Foreign Mission School in Connecticut. Elias was the fifth of six children. The year the boy was born, his father and other leaders had signed the Treaty of New Echota, ceding the remainder of Cherokee lands in the Southeast in exchange for removal to Indian Territory and lands west of the Mississippi River. Boudinot&#x27;s mother Harriet died in 1836, several months after her seventh child was stillborn. The family moved to Indian Territory prior to the forced removal of 1838.

In 1839, when Boudinot was four years old, his father and other Treaty Party leaders were assassinated by Cherokee opponents for having given up the communal tribal lands, which was considered a capital offense. His uncle Stand Watie survived an attack the same day. For their safety, Boudinot and his siblings were sent back to Connecticut to their mother&#x27;s family. The Golds ensured the children received good educations. As a youth, Boudinot studied engineering in Manchester, Vermont.

==Career==
In 1851 at age eighteen, Boudinot returned West and taught school briefly. In 1853 he settled in Fayetteville, Arkansas near the Cherokee, and renewed contact with his uncle Stand Watie. He studied as a legal apprentice and passed the bar in 1856 in Arkansas. His first notable victory as a lawyer was defending his uncle Stand Watie against murder charges. Watie had killed James Foreman, one of the attackers of Major Ridge, Watie&#x27;s uncle. Major Ridge, his son John Ridge and Boudinot&#x27;s father had all been assassinated in 1839. Watie had survived the attack. Boudinot wanted to revive his family&#x27;s prominence among the Cherokee.

In Arkansas, Boudinot became active as a pro-slavery advocate in the Democratic Party; this was the majority position of party members. He was elected to the city council of Fayetteville in 1859. That year, together with James Pettigrew, he founded a pro-slavery newspaper, &quot;The Arkansan.&quot; It also favored the construction of railroads into Indian Territory, which was seen as integral to development. Many American Indians did not want their territory broken up by such intrusions. Boudinot urged the territory to regularize its status with the United States, and later supported measures needed to admit Oklahoma as a state.

==American Civil War==
The following year Boudinot was chosen as the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic State Central Committee and monitored rising tensions in the country. In 1861, he served as the secretary of the Secession Convention as Arkansas determined whether it would leave the Union. He also served in the 2d Cherokee Mounted Rifles under his uncle Stand Watie. Boudinot was elected major of the regiment. In 1862, he was elected a delegate to the Confederate States House of Representatives, representing the majority faction of the Cherokee who supported the Confederacy. (A minority supported the Union.) After the war, he was chairman of the Cherokee Delegation (south) to the Southern Treaty Commission, which had to renegotiate their treaties postwar with the United States. They were forced to cede territory, emancipate their slaves, and to offer full citizenship to Cherokee Freedmen who chose to stay with the nation, in a pattern similar to that which the United States required of the former states in rebellion.

==Later years==
Following the war, Boudinot and his uncle Stand Watie started a tobacco factory. They intended to take advantage of tax immunities in the 1866 Cherokee treaty with the United States and undersell American tobacco producers, even though they had opposed the treaty. Disagreeing that the 1866 treaty provided immunity for such operations, Commissioner of Internal Revenue Columbus Delano order the factory be seized. In 1871, the US Supreme Court ruled against Boudinot and Watie. It said that the Congress could abrogate previous treaty guarantees, and that the 1866 treaty had not renewed or provided for previous tax immunities.

Boudinot continued to be active in politics and society in Indian Territory after the war. He helped attract railroad construction. Under changing Indian policy by the federal government, he helped open the former Indian Territory to white settlement with passage of the Dawes Act. It first provided for allotment of communal lands to individual households of tribal members. The federal government declared any remaining land as &quot;surplus&quot; and allowed its sale to non-Native Americans. Boudinot founded the city of Vinita, Oklahoma.

He also spent time lobbying the federal government in Washington, DC. Among his activities was lobbying for the railroads. Congress passed a bill in 1873 to provide financial relief for Boudinot. However, this bill was pocket vetoed by President Ulysses S. Grant. Beginning in 1874, Boudinot served as private secretary to Congressman Thomas M. Gunter (D-Arkansas). He also was appointed to some paid committee clerkships. After Gunter left Congress, Boudinot became the secretary to U.S. Senator James David Walker of Arkansas. In 1885, he tried to gain appointment as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Although supported by Arkansas politicians, he was unsuccessful.

He also practiced law in Arkansas with the politician Robert Ward Johnson (1814-1879), who had been elected to both houses of Congress before the Civil War. Boudinot was active politically on issues related to the Indian Territory. He frequently spoke on the lecture circuit about Cherokee issues and development in the West, and was considered a prominent orator. Boudinot contributed to the eventual formation of the state of Oklahoma in the early twentieth century. Many Cherokee and others of the Five Civilized Tribes had first tried to gain passage of legislation to found a state to be controlled by Native Americans. He continued his work as an attorney. He died at the age of 55 of dysentery in Fort Smith on September 27, 1890. He is buried in Oak Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Boudinot did not marry until 1885, when he was 50. He married Clara Minear; they had no children. After their marriage, they moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, and lived there for the rest of their years.

<text>An Asian option (or &quot;average value&quot; option) is a special type of option contract. For Asian options, the payoff is determined by the average underlying price over some pre-set period of time. This is different from the case of the usual European option and American option, where the payoff of the option contract depends on the price of the underlying instrument at exercise; Asian options are thus one of the basic forms of exotic options.

There are two types of Asian options: Average Price Option (fixed strike), where the strike price is predetermined and the averaging price of the underlying asset is used for payoff calculation; and Average Strike Option (floating strike), where the averaging price of the underlying asset over the duration becomes the strike price.
One advantage of Asian options is that these reduce the risk of market manipulation of the underlying instrument at maturity. Another advantage of Asian options involves the relative cost of Asian options compared to European or American options. Because of the averaging feature, Asian options reduce the volatility inherent in the option; therefore, Asian options are typically cheaper than European or American options. This can be an advantage for corporations that are subject to the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised Statement No. 123, which required that corporations expense employee stock options.

== Etymology ==

In the 1980s Mark Standish was with the London-based Bankers Trust working on fixed income derivatives and proprietary arbitrage trading. David Spaughton worked as a systems analyst in the financial markets with Bankers Trust since 1984 when the Bank of England first gave licences for banks to do foreign exchange options in the London market. In 1987 Standish and Spaughton were in Tokyo on business when &quot;they developed the first commercially used pricing formula for options linked to the average price of crude oil.&quot; They called this exotic option the Asian option because they were in Asia.

== Permutations of Asian option ==

There are numerous permutations of Asian option; the most basic are listed below:

* Fixed strike (or average rate) Asian call payout
:: formula_1
: where A denotes the average price for the period [0, T], and K is the strike price. &lt;br&gt;The equivalent put option is given by
:: formula_2

* Floating strike (or floating rate) Asian call option payout
:: formula_3
: where S(T) is the price at maturity and k is a weighting, usually 1 so often omitted from descriptions. &lt;br&gt;The equivalent put option payoff is given by
:: formula_4

== Types of averaging ==

The Average formula_5 may be obtained in many ways. Conventionally, this means an arithmetic average. In the &quot;continuous&quot; case, this is obtained by
: formula_6

For the case of &quot;discrete monitoring&quot; (with monitoring at the times formula_7 and formula_8) we have the average given by
: formula_9

There also exist Asian options with geometric average; in the continuous case, this is given by
: formula_10

== Pricing of Asian options ==
A discussion of the problem of pricing Asian options with Monte Carlo methods is given in a paper by Kemna and Vorst.

In the path integral approach to option pricing, the problem for geometric average can be solved via the Effective Classical potential of Feynman and Kleinert.

Rogers and Shi solve the pricing problem with a PDE approach.

A Variance Gamma model can be efficiently implemented when pricing Asian-style options. Then, using the Bondesson series representation to generate the variance gamma process can increase the computational performance of the Asian option pricer.

Within jump diffusions and stochastic volatility models, the pricing problem for geometric Asian options can still be solved. For the arithmetic Asian option in Lévy models, one can rely on numerical methods or on analytic bounds.

=== European Asian call and put options with geometric averaging ===
We are able to derive a closed-form solution for the geometric Asian option; when used in conjunction with control variates in Monte Carlo simulations, the formula is useful for deriving fair values for the arithmetic Asian option.

Define the continuous-time geometric mean formula_11 as:formula_12where the underlying formula_13 follows a standard geometric Brownian motion. It is straightforward from here to calculate that:formula_14To derive the stochastic integral, which was originally formula_15, note that:formula_16This may be confirmed by Itô&#x27;s lemma. Integrating this expression and using the fact that formula_17, we find that the integrals are equivalent - this will be useful later on in the derivation. Using martingale pricing, the value of the European Asian call with geometric averaging formula_18 is given by:formula_19In order to find formula_20, we must find formula_21 such that:formula_22After some algebra, we find that:formula_23At this point the stochastic integral is the sticking point for finding a solution to this problem. However, it is easy to verify with Itô isometry that the integral is normally distributed as:formula_24This is equivalent to saying that formula_25 with formula_26. Therefore, we have that:formula_27Now it is possible the calculate the value of the European Asian call with geometric averaging! At this point, it is useful to define:formula_28Going through the same process as is done with the Black-Scholes model, we are able to find that:formula_29In fact, going through the same arguments for the European Asian put with geometric averaging formula_30, we find that:formula_31This implies that there exists a version of put-call parity for European Asian options with geometric averaging:formula_32

== Variations of Asian option ==

There are some variations that are sold in the over-the-counter market. For example, BNP Paribas introduced a variation, termed conditional Asian option, where the average underlying price is based on observations of prices over a pre-specified threshold. A conditional Asian put option has the payoff

formula_33

where formula_34 is the threshold and formula_35 is an indicator function which equals formula_36 if formula_5 is true and equals zero otherwise. Such an option offers a cheaper alternative than the classic Asian put option, as the limitation on the range of observations reduces the volatility of average price. It is typically sold at the money and last for up to five years. The pricing of conditional Asian option is discussed by Feng and Volkmer.

<doc id="438093" wikidata="Q1286721" url="?curid=438093" title="Lookback option">
<text>Lookback options, in the terminology of finance, are a type of exotic option with path dependency, among many other kind of options. The payoff depends on the optimal (maximum or minimum) underlying asset&#x27;s price occurring over the life of the option. The option allows the holder to &quot;look back&quot; over time to determine the payoff. There exist two kinds of lookback options: with floating strike and with fixed strike. 

==Lookback option with floating strike==
As the name introduces it, the option&#x27;s strike price is floating and determined at maturity. The floating strike is the optimal value of the underlying asset&#x27;s price during the option life. The payoff is the maximum difference between the market asset&#x27;s price at maturity and the floating strike. For the call, the strike price is fixed at the asset&#x27;s lowest price during the option&#x27;s life, and, for the put, it is fixed at the asset&#x27;s highest price. Note that these options are not really options, as they will be always exercised by their holder. In fact, the option is never out-of-the-money, which makes it more expensive than a standard option. The payoff functions for the lookback call and the lookback put, respectively, are given by:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the asset&#x27;s maximum price during the life of the option, formula_3 is the asset&#x27;s minimum price during the life of the option, and formula_4 is the underlying asset&#x27;s price at maturity formula_5.

==Lookback option with fixed strike==
As for the standard European options, the option&#x27;s strike price is fixed. The difference is that the option is not exercised at the price at maturity: the payoff is the maximum difference between the optimal underlying asset price and the strike. For the call option, the holder chooses to exercise at the point when the underlying asset price is at its highest level. For the put option, the holder chooses to exercise at the underlying asset&#x27;s lowest price. The payoff functions for the lookback call and the lookback put, respectively, are given by:
:formula_6
where formula_2 is the asset&#x27;s maximum price during the life of the option, formula_3 is the asset&#x27;s minimum price during the life of the option, and formula_9 is the strike price.

==Arbitrage-free price of lookback options with floating strike==
Using the Black–Scholes model, and its notations, we can price the European lookback options with floating strike. The pricing method is much more complicated than for the standard European options and can be found in &quot;Musiela&quot;. Assume that there exists a continuously-compounded risk-free interest rate formula_10 and a constant stock&#x27;s volatility formula_11. Assume that the time to maturity is formula_12, and that we will price the option at time formula_13, although the life of the option started at time zero. Define formula_14. Finally, set that 
:formula_15

Then, the price of the lookback call option with floating strike is given by:
:formula_16
where 
:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19
and where formula_20 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, formula_21.

Similarly, the price of the lookback put option with floating strike is given by:
:formula_22

==Partial lookback options==
Partial lookback options are a subclass of lookback options with the same payoff structure, but with the goal of reducing its fair price. One way is to scale the fair price linearly with constant formula_23, where formula_24. Thus the payoff is:
:formula_25

Selecting specific dates is a more intricate way of creating partial lookback options and other partial path-dependent options. The principle lies in selecting a subset of monitoring dates, so that the lookback condition is less strong and thus reducing the premium. Examples include the partial lookback option proposed by Heynen and Kat, and the amnesiac lookback option proposed by Chang and Li. Discrete partial path-dependent options are overpriced under continuous assumptions; their pricing is complex and is typically performed using numerical methods.

<doc id="438098" wikidata="Q5452209" url="?curid=438098" title="First-sale doctrine">
<text>The first-sale doctrine (also sometimes referred to as the &quot;right of first sale&quot; or the &quot;first sale rule&quot;) is a legal concept that limits the rights of an intellectual property owner to control resale of products embodying its intellectual property. The doctrine enables the distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving, video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example, enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others). In trademark law, this same doctrine enables reselling of trademarked products after the trademark holder puts the products on the market. In the case of patented products, the doctrine allows resale of patented products without any control from the patent holder. The first sale doctrine does not apply to patented processes, which are instead governed by the patent exhaustion doctrine.

==Overview of copyright law application==
Copyright law grants a copyright owner an exclusive right &quot;to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending&quot;. This is called a &quot;distribution right&quot; and differs from the copyright owner&#x27;s &quot;reproduction right&quot; which involves making copies of the copyrighted works. Rather than the right to copy, the distribution right involves the right to transfer physical copies or phonorecords (i.e., recorded music) of the copyrighted work. For example, the distribution right could be infringed when a retailer acquires and sells to the public unlawfully made audio or video tapes. Although the retailer may not have copied the work in any way and may not have known that the tapes were made unlawfully, they nevertheless infringe the distribution right by the sale. The distribution right allows the copyright owner to seek redress from any member in the chain of distribution.

The first-sale doctrine creates a basic exception to the copyright holder&#x27;s distribution right. Once the work is lawfully sold or even transferred gratuitously, the copyright owner&#x27;s interest in the material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied is exhausted. The owner of the material object can then dispose of it as they see fit. Thus, one who buys a copy of a book is entitled to resell it, rent it, give it away, or destroy it. However, the owner of the copy of the book will not be able to make new copies of the book because the first-sale doctrine does not limit the restrictions allowed by the copyright owner&#x27;s reproduction right. The rationale of the doctrine is to prevent the copyright owner from restraining the free alienability of goods. Without the doctrine, a possessor of a copy of a copyrighted work would have to negotiate with the copyright owner every time they wished to dispose of their copy. After the initial transfer of ownership of a legal copy of a copyrighted work, the first-sale doctrine eliminates the copyright holder&#x27;s right to control ownership of that specific copy.

The doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1908 (see &quot;Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus&quot;) and subsequently codified in the Copyright Act of 1909. In the &quot;Bobbs-Merrill&quot; case, the publisher, Bobbs-Merrill, had inserted a notice in its books that any retail sale at a price under $1.00 would constitute an infringement of its copyright. The defendants, who owned Macy&#x27;s department store, disregarded the notice and sold the books at a lower price without Bobbs-Merrill&#x27;s consent. The Supreme Court held that the exclusive statutory right to &quot;vend&quot; applied only to the first sale of the copyrighted work.

Today, this rule of law is codified in 17 U.S.C. § 109(a), which provides:

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 (3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.

The elements of the first sale doctrine can be summarized as follows: (1) the copy was lawfully made with the authorization of the copyright owner; (2) ownership of the copy was initially transferred under the copyright owner&#x27;s authority; (3) the defendant is a lawful owner of the copy in question; and (4) the defendant&#x27;s use implicates the distribution right only; not the reproduction or some other right given to the copyright owner.

Although copyright has always been treated as a limited territorial right, in 2013 in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. the US Supreme Court eliminated the territorial restriction on the first sale. Since then, copyrighted products legally bought abroad (often at a lower price) can be legally imported and sold in the US without any post-sale restrictions.

===Limitations===
The first sale doctrine only limits the distribution rights of copyright holders. This principle sometimes clashes with the holder&#x27;s other rights, such as the right of reproduction and derivative work rights. For example, in &quot;Lee v. A.R.T. Co.&quot;, the defendant bought plaintiff&#x27;s artworks in the form of notecards and then mounted them on ceramic tiles, covering the artworks with transparent epoxy resin. Despite plaintiff&#x27;s assertion of violation of his right to prepare derivative works, the 7th Circuit held that the derivative work right was not violated and that defendant&#x27;s sale of the tiles was protected under the first sale doctrine. However, based on very similar facts, the 9th Circuit in &quot;Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Company&quot; held that plaintiff&#x27;s right to prepare derivative works was infringed and that the first sale doctrine did not protect the defendant under such circumstances.

===Application to digital copies===
The first-sale doctrine does not neatly fit transfers of copies of digital works because an actual transfer does not actually happen—instead, the recipient receives a new copy of the work while, at the same time, the sender has the original copy (unless that copy is deleted, either automatically or manually). For example, this exact issue played out in &quot;Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.&quot;, a case involving an online marketplace for pre-owned digital music.

E-books have the same issue. Because the first sale doctrine does not apply to electronic books, libraries cannot freely lend e-books indefinitely after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text. This results in e-book publishers placing restrictions on the number of times an e-book can circulate and/or the amount of time a book is within a collection before a library&#x27;s license expires, then the book no longer belongs to them.

The question is whether the first-sale doctrine should be retooled to reflect the realities of the digital age. Physical copies degrade over time, whereas digital information may not. Works in digital format can be reproduced without any flaws and can be disseminated worldwide without much difficulty. Thus, applying the first sale doctrine to digital copies affects the market for the original to a greater degree than transfers of physical copies. The U.S. Copyright Office stated that &quot;[t]he tangible nature of a copy is a defining element of the first sale doctrine and critical to its rationale.&quot;

The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled, on July 3, 2012, that it is indeed permissible to resell software licenses even if the digital good has been downloaded directly from the Internet, and that the first sale doctrine applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited amount of time, as such sale involves a transfer of ownership, thus prohibiting any software maker from preventing the resale of their software by any of their legitimate owners. The court requires that the previous owner must no longer be able to use the licensed software after the resale, but finds that the practical difficulties in enforcing this clause should not be an obstacle to authorizing resale, as they are also present for software which can be installed from physical supports, where the first-sale doctrine is in force. The ruling applies to the European Union, but could indirectly find its way to North America; moreover the situation could entice publishers to offer platforms for a secondary market. In a notable case, the High Court of Paris found against Valve for not allowing the resale of games from the Steam digital storefront, requiring Valve to comply with the European Union Directives of first-sale doctrine within three months, pending appeals.

===Ownership requirement===
For the first sale doctrine to apply, lawful ownership of the copy or phonorecord is required. As §109(d) prescribes, first sale doctrine does not apply if the possession of the copy is &quot;by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise without acquiring ownership of it&quot;.

Some software and digital content publishers claim in their end-user license agreements (EULA) that their software or content is licensed, not sold, and thus the first sale doctrine does not apply to their works. These publishers have had some success in contracting around first sale doctrine through various clickwrap, shrink wrap, and other license agreements. For example, if someone buys MP3 songs from Amazon.com, the MP3 files are merely licensed to them and hence they may not be able to resell those MP3 files. However, MP3 songs bought through iTunes Store may be characterized as &quot;sales&quot; because of Apple&#x27;s language in its EULA and hence they may be resellable, if other requirements of first sale doctrine are met.

Courts have struggled and taken dramatically different approaches to sort out when only a license was granted to the end user as compared to ownership. Most of these cases involved software-licensing agreements. In general, courts look beneath the surface of the agreements to conclude whether the agreements create a licensing relationship or if they amount to, in substance, sales subject to first sale doctrine under §109(a). Thus, specifying that the agreement grants only a &quot;license&quot; is necessary to create the licensing relationship, but not sufficient. Other terms of the agreement should be consistent with such a licensing relationship.

In &quot;Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.&quot; the 9th Circuit created a three-factor test to decide whether a particular software licensing agreement is successful in creating a licensing relationship with the end user. The factors include: 1) whether a copyright owner specifies that a user is granted a license; 2) whether the copyright owner significantly restricts the user&#x27;s ability to transfer the software to others; and 3) whether the copyright owner imposes notable use restrictions on the software. In &quot;Vernor&quot;, Autodesk&#x27;s license agreement specified that it retains title to the software and the user is only granted a non-exclusive license. The agreement also had restrictions against modifying, translating, or reverse-engineering the software, or removing any proprietary marks from the software packaging or documentation. The agreement also specified that software could not be transferred or leased without Autodesk&#x27;s written consent, and could not be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. Based on these facts, the 9th Circuit held that the user is only a licensee of Autodesk&#x27;s software, not an owner and hence the user could not resell the software on eBay without Autodesk&#x27;s permission.

However, the same 9th Circuit panel that decided &quot;Vernor v. Autodesk&quot;, refused to apply &quot;Vernor&quot; three-factor test in &quot;UMG v. Augusto&quot; to a purported licensing agreement created when UMG sent unsolicited promotional CDs to music critics. The promotional CDs&#x27; packaging contained the language: &quot;This CD is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only. Acceptance of this CD shall constitute an agreement to comply with the terms of the license. Resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws.&quot; Augusto tried to sell these CDs on eBay and UMG argued that first sale doctrine did not apply since the CDs were not sold and only a licensing relationship was created. However the court held that first sale doctrine applies when a copy is given away and that recipients of the promotional CDs did not accept the terms of the license agreement by merely not sending back the unsolicited CDs.

In the case &quot;UsedSoft v Oracle&quot;, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the sale of a software product, either through a physical support or download, constituted a transfer of ownership in EU law, thus the first sale doctrine applies; the ruling thereby breaks the &quot;licensed, not sold&quot; legal theory, but leaves open numerous questions.

===Importation of copies===
Section 602(a)(1) of the US copyright statute states that &quot;importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords.&quot; This provision provides the copyright owner an opportunity to stop goods from entering the United States market altogether.

Application of this provision created difficult legal issues in the context of gray market products. Gray market dealers buy the genuine goods in foreign countries at a significant discount from U.S. prices. They then import these genuine goods into the U.S. and sell them at discount prices, undercutting the authorized U.S. dealers. The gray market exists where the price for goods outside the US is lower than the price inside.

On the surface, §602(a), barring unauthorized importation, would seem to clash with the first-sale doctrine, which permits the resale of lawfully made copies. The issue comes down to whether §602(a) creates an affirmative right to bar all unauthorized importation, or does the first-sale doctrine limit the reach of §602(a), thus permitting the resale of at least some lawfully made imported copies.

In 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Quality King v. L&#x27;Anza&quot; found that first-sale doctrine applied to imported goods at least where the imported goods are first lawfully made in the United States, shipped abroad for resale, and later reenter the United States. That case involved importation of hair care products bearing copyrighted labels. A unanimous Supreme Court found that the first-sale doctrine does apply to importation into the US of copyrighted works (the labels), which were made in the US and then exported.

However, the Supreme Court did not decide the issue where gray-market products are initially manufactured abroad and then imported into the US. The Court indicated that importation of goods made outside the US could perhaps be barred under §602(a), since such goods would not be &quot;lawfully made under this title&quot;. Such products might be lawfully made, either by the copyright owner or a licensee, but they would not be lawfully made under US copyright law. Rather, they would be lawfully made under the copyright laws of the other country; and the first-sale doctrine would therefore not limit the §602 importation restriction.

The 2008 case &quot;Omega v. Costco&quot; involved this exact unresolved issue, where the defendant Costco obtained authentic Omega watches, which feature a copyrighted design on the back of the watches, through the gray market and resold them in its stores in the US. Omega manufactured these watches outside the US and did not authorize their importation into the US. Based on the &quot;Quality King&quot; case, the 9th Circuit held that &quot;application of first-sale doctrine to foreign-made copies would impermissibly apply&quot; the Copyright Act extraterritorially. However, the court stated that first-sale doctrine might still apply to a foreign manufactured copy if it was imported &quot;with the authority of the U.S. copyright owner&quot;. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to &quot;Omega v. Costco&quot;, and affirmed 4–4. However, as an evenly split decision, it set precedent only in the 9th Circuit, not nationwide.

However, in &quot;Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&quot;, in 2013, the United States Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner&#x27;s permission and then imported into the US. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff&#x27;s permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court&#x27;s holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to charge vastly different prices in different markets due to ease of arbitrage. The decision removes the incentive to US manufacturers of shifting manufacturing abroad purely in an attempt to circumvent the first-sale doctrine.

==Exceptions==

===Record rentals===
The Record Rental Amendment of 1984, codified in 17 USC §109(b) prohibits an owner of a phonorecord that embodies a sound recording or musical work from renting it to the public for direct or indirect commercial advantage. This exception was designed to prevent music stores from renting records and thereby facilitating home copying.

Section 109(b) is an exception to the first sale doctrine, but it is limited in several ways. It applies only to rentals, and not to resale or other transfers. It is also limited to a subset of sound recordings—only those sound recordings that contain only a musical work. It does not apply to sound recordings that contain other content, such as commentaries or dialog soundtrack, or to non-musical sound recordings, for example audiobooks. Lastly, libraries and educational institutions are exempt from this restriction, and may rent or loan musical sound recordings.

===Software rentals===
The Copyright Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 amended §109(b) further to prohibit rentals of computer software for direct or indirect commercial advantage. The exception does not apply to lending of a copy by a nonprofit library for nonprofit purposes, provided the library affixes an appropriate warning. The amendment also specifically excluded:
* A computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or
* A computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games and may be designed for other purposes.

==Overview of trademark law application==

With reference to trade in tangible merchandise, such as the retailing of goods bearing a trademark, the first-sale doctrine serves to immunize a reseller from infringement liability.

A guiding principle for determining if a resale is protected by the first sale principle, is any &quot;material differences&quot; between a non-authorized seller and a seller not authorized by the trademark holder.

Such protection to the reseller extends to the point where said goods have not been altered so as to be materially different from those originating from the trademark owner. Alterations or &quot;material differences&quot; don&#x27;t have to be physical in nature, but may also apply to warranties and service offered by the trademark holder. The holding notion is if any alteration constitutes &quot;material differences&quot; between goods originating from copyright holder and the sold item. Such that the sale &quot;may mislead the consumer and damage the [trademark] owner&#x27;s goodwill.&quot;
===Lack of Comparable Quality Controls===

A trademark owner can overcome the first sale doctrine defense if it can show that the unauthorized reseller is using the trademark on goods that lack its quality control standards. Courts have identified a four-prong test that a trademark owner must satisfy:
 1. It maintains a substantial set of quality control standards and procedures for its products;
 2. It consistently applies these standards and procedures;
 3. The reseller is not abiding by these standards; and
 4. The sale of products that do not meet the trademark owner&#x27;s standards is likely to confuse consumers and harm the trademark&#x27;s value.

<text>In finance, an exotic option is an option which has features making it more complex than commonly traded vanilla options. Like the more general exotic derivatives they may have several triggers relating to determination of payoff. An exotic option may also include a non-standard underlying instrument, developed for a particular client or for a particular market. Exotic options are more complex than options that trade on an exchange, and are generally traded over the counter.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;exotic option&quot; was popularized by Mark Rubinstein&#x27;s 1990 working paper (published 1992, with Eric Reiner) &quot;Exotic Options&quot;, with the term based either on exotic wagers in horse racing, or due to the use of international terms such as &quot;Asian option&quot;, suggesting the &quot;exotic Orient&quot;.

Journalist Brian Palmer used the &quot;successful $1 bet on the superfecta&quot; in the 2010 Kentucky Derby that &quot;paid a whopping $101,284.60&quot; as an example of the controversial high-risk, high-payout exotic bets that were observed by track-watchers since the 1970s in his article about why we use the term exotic for certain types of financial instrument. Palmer compared these horse racing bets to the controversial emerging exotic financial instruments that concerned then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker in 1980. He argued that just as the exotic wagers survived the media controversy so will the exotic options.

In 1987, Bankers Trust&#x27;s Mark Standish and David Spaughton were in Tokyo on business when &quot;they developed the first commercially used pricing formula for options linked to the average price of crude oil.&quot; They called this exotic option the Asian option, because they were in Asia.

== Development ==

Exotic options are often created by financial engineers and rely on complex models to attempt to price them.

==Features==
A straight call or put option, either American or European, would be considered a non-exotic or vanilla option. There are two general types of exotic options: path-independent and path-dependent. An option is path-independent if its value depends only on the final price of the underlying instrument. Path-dependent options depend not only on the final price of the underlying instrument, but also on all the prices leading to the final price. An exotic option could have one or more of the following features:
* The payoff at maturity depends not just on the value of the underlying instrument at maturity, but also on its value at several times during the contract&#x27;s life (for example an Asian option depending on some average, a lookback option depending on the maximum or minimum, a barrier option which ceases to exist if a certain level is reached or not reached by the underlying, a digital option, peroni options, range options, spread options, etc.)
* It could depend on more than one index, such as in basket options, outperformance options, Himalaya options, or other mountain range options.
* The manner of settlement may vary depending on the moneyness of the option at expiry, such as a cash or share option.
* There could be callability and putability rights.
* It could involve foreign exchange rates in various ways, such as a quanto or composite option.

Even products traded actively in the market can have some exotic characteristics, such as convertible bonds, whose valuation can depend on the price and volatility of the underlying equity, the issuer&#x27;s credit rating, the level and volatility of interest rates, and the correlations between these factors.

==Barriers==

Barriers in exotic option are determined by the underlying price and ability of the stock to be active or inactive during the trade period, for instance up-and-out option has a high chance of being inactive should the underlying price go beyond the marked barrier. Down-and-in-option is very likely to be active should the underlying prices of the stock go below the marked barrier. Up-and-in option is very likely to be active should the underlying price go beyond the marked barrier.
One-touch double barrier binary options are path-dependent options in which the existence and payment of the options depend on the movement of the underlying price through their option life.

== Examples ==

*Barrier
*Cash or Share
*Cliquet
*Compound option
*Constant proportion portfolio insurance
*Digital/Binary option
*Lookback
*Rainbow option
*Timer call
*Variance swap
*Bermudan options

<doc id="438116" wikidata="Q495138" url="?curid=438116" title="Romero (film)">
<text>Romero is a 1989 biographical film depicting the story of Salvadoran archbishop Óscar Romero, who organized peaceful protests against the violent military regime, eventually at the cost of his own life. The film stars Raúl Juliá as Oscar Romero, Richard Jordan as Romero&#x27;s close friend and fellow martyred priest, Rutilio Grande, as well as actors Ana Alicia and Harold Gould. Although the film depicts true events, there are some fictional characters.

== Plot ==
During the 1977 El Salvadoran presidential election, public unrest is at an all-time high over fears of election fraud. In the midst of a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla insurgency by the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, the anti-communist military dictatorship uses death squads to abduct, torture and &quot;disappear&quot; anyone who speaks about their terrible human rights record. The military also prevents average voters from getting to the polls; soldiers are shown blocking a bus bringing people to town on election day. When the people decide to walk, the military shoots up their vans so that they have no transportation for the return journey.

The Vatican elevates theologically conservative Oscar Arnulfo Romero (Raul Julia) to the position of Archbishop of San Salvador, hoping that he will not get involved in politics. Although apolitical, Romero is afraid of the government&#x27;s increasing hostility. He initially refrains from stirring anti-government sentiments, but, as he spends more time as archbishop, he sees evidence of deception, oppression, and systemic murder, after which he cannot support the government in good conscience and begins to speak out. After the assassination of Father Rutilio Grande (Richard Jordan), an outspoken Jesuit advocate for the poor and close friend of Father Romero&#x27;s, Romero begins to take a stand against the government&#x27;s policies, prompting the government to retaliate by ordering death squads to target the priests of his Archdiocese.

After failing to rescue a pro-government hostage of the Pro-Soviet guerrillas in a botched ransom, Romero discovers that his friend Father Osuna (Alejandro Bracho), a militant critic of the military regime, has been captured and tortured. After securing his release, Romero instigates a boycott of the president-elect&#x27;s inauguration, defying him by saying Mass in a church the Salvadoran military has taken over as a barracks. He later attempts to secure the release of a soldier taken hostage with Fr. Osuna by the guerrillas, but is arrested in the process. Fr. Osuna is subsequently tortured to death, despite Romero&#x27;s protesting pleas.

Undeterred, Romero rejects the violent methods of the guerrillas, but is nonetheless assassinated while saying Mass, specifically while consecrating the Eucharist. The film concludes with text stating:

Archbishop Romero was murdered on March 24, 1980. He had spoken the disturbing truth. Many chose not to listen. As a result, between 1980 and 1989 more than 60,000 Salvadorians were killed. But the struggle for peace and freedom, justice and dignity goes on.

By 1992, when the Salvadorian Civil War ended (three years after the movie was made), the total number of Salvadorians killed had increased to over 75,000.

This was the first time a Catholic company produced a major film. The company was also known for the production of a long-standing television series called &quot;Insight&quot;. The film was screened in 1989 at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was directed by Australian filmmaker John Duigan and produced by Paulist Pictures founder Father Ellwood (Bud) Kieser. Alfonso Cuarón, a Mexican film director, worked as an assistant director for this film. Composer Gabriel Yared, who went on to win BAFTA Awards and an Oscar for his other scores, composed the music for &quot;Romero&quot;. The movie was filmed in Mexico and set in El Salvador.

== Reception ==
&quot;Romero&quot; was generally well received by critics. The film holds a 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 reviews. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a mildly positive review, awarding it two and a half stars out of four. Ebert praised Julia&#x27;s &quot;restrained and reasonable&quot; performance but felt that the film was predictable and therefore not as powerful as other biopics. &quot;Spirituality and Practice&quot; gave the film a positive review stating it as an &quot;excellent drama&quot; with most of the praise going towards Raul Julia in his performance as Romero.

&quot;Romero&quot; did receive criticism on how it did not shed light on US involvement. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated the fact that &quot;the film doesn&#x27;t deal with the role of the American government in El Salvador&#x27;s plight, beyond a plea from Romero for the US to stop sending arms that will be only used against his country&#x27;s people.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that the film &quot;is more important as the brief, considerably simplified biography of a heroic man than as cinema. The film&#x27;s manner is that of a textbook.&quot;

<text>John Hall (1575 – 25 November 1635) was an English physician and son-in-law of William Shakespeare as the husband of Susanna Hall.

==Life==
He was born at Carlton, Bedfordshire and studied at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge from 1589, receiving a B.A. in 1593 and an M.A. in 1597. He became a physician, although he did not hold an English medical degree; it has been speculated that he studied medicine in France.

He established a practice in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was the only doctor in the town. He married Shakespeare&#x27;s daughter Susanna on 5 June 1607. They had one daughter, Elizabeth. Their home in Stratford, Hall&#x27;s Croft, is now open to the public. After Shakespeare&#x27;s death, they moved into his former house at New Place.

Hall appears to have had a close relationship with his father-in-law, as they are recorded being in agreement over a local issue regarding enclosure in 1613. They are also known to have travelled together to London on business in 1614.

==Defamation case==
Hall was a leading local Puritan. He had supported the Puritan vicar, Thomas Wilson, against whom there was much local opposition. In 1613, a member of the anti-Wilson faction, John Lane, defamed Susanna, claiming she had committed adultery with one Ralph Smith, a 35-year-old haberdasher, and had caught a venereal disease from Smith. On 15 July the Halls brought suit for slander against Lane in the Consistory Court at Worcester. Robert Whatcott, who three years later witnessed Shakespeare&#x27;s will, testified for the Halls, but Lane failed to appear. Lane was found guilty and excommunicated. He was later involved in a riot to protest against Wilson.

==Writings==
Hall prepared two notebooks of his case notes with the intention that they be published. They were purchased and translated from Latin by James Cooke (1614–1688), a surgeon. He published them in 1657, 22 years after Hall&#x27;s death, as . The earliest case, in Stratford, dates from 1611, making it almost certain that Hall lived and worked in Stratford from at least the time of his marriage. The first notebook still survives, but the original manuscript of the second notebook has been lost.

==Portrayals==
The slander case has been used as the subject of a play, &quot;The Herbal Bed&quot;, by Peter Whelan. In the original production Hall was played by Liam Cunningham.

He was portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in &quot;A Waste of Shame: The Mystery of Shakespeare and His Sonnets&quot;, a TV film first broadcast on BBC Four on 22 November 2005 as part of a supporting programme for the BBC&#x27;s ShakespeaRe-Told season.

Hadley Fraser portrayed him in the 2018 movie &quot;All Is True&quot;, directed by Kenneth Branagh.

<doc id="438125" wikidata="Q293490" url="?curid=438125" title="Al-Hadi">
<text>Abū Muḥammad Mūsā ibn al-Mahdī al-Hādī (; 26 April 764 CE 14 September 786 CE) better known by his laqab al-Hādī () was the fourth Arab Abbasid caliph who succeeded his father al-Mahdi and ruled from 169 AH (785 CE) until his death in 170 AH (786 CE). His short reign ended with internal chaos and power struggles with his mother.

==Early life==
Al-Hadi was born in 764. His father was al-Mahdi and al-Khayzuran bint Atta was the mother of both caliphs Musa al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid. She had another son named Isa ibn al-Mahdi, and a daughter named Banuqah or Banujah. His mother, al-Khayzuran was born in Mecca and brought up in Jurash. She had two sisters, Salsal bint Atta and Asma bint Atta, and a brother Ghitrif ibn Atta. She was al-Mahdi&#x27;s favourite wife. Al-Mahdi consulted her on important matters of defense and administration, and officers and clerics went to her door day and night to get what they wanted from the caliph through her, and the petitioners lined up outside her door and it was crowded like a market. Khayzuran&#x27;s influence in public and political life increased gradually from interferer and decisive incursions during the reign of her husband to more powerful and wider ones during the reigns of her two sons. Al-Hadi also had several half-brothers; Ubaydallah, Ibrahim, Mansur, Ali, Abdallah. He also had half-sisters; Abbasa was his elder half-sister, others were Ulayya and Aliyah.

Al-Hadi was the eldest son of al-Mahdi and al-Khayzuran and the older brother of Harun al-Rashid. He was very dear to his father and was appointed as the first crown prince by his father at the age of 16 and was chosen as the leader of the army. Prior to his death, al-Mahdi supposedly favored his second son, Harun al-Rashid, as his successor, taking him on multiple military expeditions in 779 and 781 to train him to be the next caliph, as his own father prepared him, but died before the formal transfer of the crown prince title could occur. Not to mention, their mother, Khayzuran played a driver in these thoughts of al-Mahdi and was a partner. Alternatively, al-Rashid was a general and may have accompanied his father to war to train for and carry out his profession.

==Caliphate==
Regardless of the intent, in 785, Al-Mahdi died during an expedition with his son Harun, who rushed back to Baghdad to inform his mother. At al-Mahdi&#x27;s untimely death, Khayzuran took control of the situation. She ensured a smooth transition of power and to secure the succession for her son, she called upon the viziers and ordered them to pay the wages of the army to secure order, and then had them swear allegiance to her son as their new caliph in his absence, and held everything together until al-Hadi returned to Baghdad. Al-Hadi became the caliph at the age of 25, the youngest caliph to yet rule the Abbasids. His brother Harun al-Rashid became his crown prince at 22. This was a point of insecurity for al-Hadi as he spent the majority of his rule attempting to wrest the title of crown prince from al-Rashid - whether he was granted it before or after his father&#x27;s death - and install his 7-year-old son Ja&#x27;far in his place. As Ja&#x27;far was very young and it went against law and wisdom to install him as crown prince, al-Hadi tried to put pressure on Harun and convince him to resign himself. So, Harun escaped from the capital and did not return there until the end of his brother&#x27;s life. However, al-Hadi&#x27;s attempt to depose his brother caused further conflict between him and his mother Khayzuran, as they each strove for their respective sons to become the next caliph: al-Hadi for Ja&#x27;far and Khayzuran for Harun.

Al-Hadi was considered an &quot;enlightened ruler&quot; by his constituents and continued the &quot;progressive&quot; moves of his Abbasids predecessor. Like his father he was very open to the people of his empire and allowed citizens to visit him in the palace at Baghdad to address him. He was physically strong and famous for his bravery and talent in government and generosity. However, he was cruel, daring and zealous. Al-Hadi was especially malevolent to non-Muslim citizens, as he continued his father&#x27;s persecutions and quashed multiple internal uprisings. He crushed a Kharijite rebellion, repelled a Byzantine invasion and seized some territory in the process.

Al-Hadi was also notorious for his cruelty and persecution of the Sayyids and the Shia, he imposed further restrictions on the Alids and the remaining descendants of the Umayyad caliphate, and treated them cruelly. He cut all the allowances al-Mahdi previously assigned them due to fear of an Alid uprising. He ordered his agents to watch all &#x27;Alids&#x27; activities and place some spies among them and ordered them to register their presence daily with local authority. In 786, the Alids of Hijaz led by Ali ibn Husayn staged an uprising in response to these conditions. They gained control of Medina, released prisoners, imprisoned Abbasid agents, and made Masjid al-Nabi his command center. Then, they set out to Makkah, were denied entry by its people and forced to confront the Abbasid army led by al-Hadi in the valley of Fakhkh, whereupon Ali ibn Husayn and his companions were defeated and killed at the Battle of Fakhkh. This event became famous, and ibn Husayn became known as Shahid Fakhkh (the martyr of Fakhkh). However, ibn Husayn&#x27;s cousin, Idris bin Abdallah, escaped to Morocco aided by Wadih, an Egyptian postal manager, where he founded the Idrisi state. After the event of Fakh, al-Hadi accused Imam al-Kazim, one of his brother&#x27;s advocates, of provoking the revolutionaries. He arrested the Imam and sentenced him to execution, but died before he could implement his decision.

There was no wanting for internal conflicts as well. At al-Mahdi&#x27;s untimely death, Al-Khayzuran, his mother, reportedly wished to continue to engage in politics as she had become accustomed to during al-Mahdi&#x27;s reign: &quot;Khayzuran wanted to dominate her son. She continued to give audiences in her chambers and discuss state affairs:
:&quot;She continued to monopolize decision-making without consulting him (&quot;al-Hadi&quot;), she behaved as she had before, during the reign of al-Mahdi, people came and went through her door. She used to exercise her authority over him in all his affairs without consulting him at all, assuming sole control over matters of ordaining and forbidding, just as she had done previously with his father.&quot;
In the first months of al-Hadi&#x27;s short reign as caliph, he allowed his mother to implement the same political freedoms his father allowed and al-Hadi was in full submission to his mother, Khayzuran. He responded positively to all the requests and demands coming to her, and when she talked to officials and other audiences and made decisions and only reported her decisions to him, he did not object and approved them. Al-Khayzuran took advantage of the fact that al-Hadi never rejected her personal request, and disguised her friends desires and the supplicants who come to her as her own in order to obtain what they wanted. It eventually came to the point in which petitioners lined up at Khayzuran&#x27;s gate in order to attain their own goals and even letters from all the provinces were sent to her court to report the affairs to her and ask her for favors for themselves, and al- Hadi heard of how his officers and governors used to go to his mother Khayzuran in hopes that what they wanted from him would be done through her words. However, al-Hadi, began to oppose her participation in state affairs; he felt she overreached, and over time he retaliated against his mother&#x27;s political power. He was not inclined to allow her displays of authority and attempted to exclude her from politics. After a serious incident, he told her: 
:&quot;Do not overstep the essential limits of womanly modesty and overdo in person the role of the generous donor. It is not dignified for women to enter upon affairs of state. It is not in the power of women to intervene ... in matters of sovereignty. Look to your prayers and your prayer beads.&quot;
The harem system first became fully institutionalized in the Islamic World under the Abbasid caliphate, when the Abbasid harem was established. At this point, however, Muslim women had not yet been fully secluded from society in a harem.

The growing seclusion of women and decline of women&#x27;s rights that would permeate the Abbasid Caliphate and the region&#x27;s latter nations were illustrated by the power struggle between the Caliph al-Hadi and his mother al-Khayzuran, who refused to live in seclusion but instead challenged the power of the Caliph by giving her own audiences to male supplicants and officials and thus mixing with men. Her son considered this improper, and he publicly addressed the issue of his mothers public life by assembling his generals and asked them:
:&#x27;Who is the better among us, you or me?&#x27; asked Caliph al-Hadi of his audience.
:&#x27;Obviously you are the better, Commander of the Faithful,&#x27; the assembly replied.
:&#x27;And whose mother is the better, mine or yours?&#x27; continued the caliph.
:&#x27;Your mother is the better, Commander of the Faithful.&#x27;
:&#x27;Who among you&#x27;, continued al-Hadi, &#x27;would like to have men spreading news about your mother?&#x27;
:&#x27;No one likes to have his mother talked about,&#x27; responded those present.
:&#x27;Then why do men go to my mother to speak to her?&#x27;

Al-Khayzuran would not be oppressed or silenced, much to al-Hadi&#x27;s chagrin. The conflict was finally exposed in public when she interceded in favor of a supplicant, Abdallah ibn Malik, and publicly demanded a reply from her son, who lost his temper and openly yelled at her and they both discussed:

:Khayzuran: You must meet my request.

:al-Hadi: I will not do it.

:Khayzuran: I already assured the chief of police that it will be done.

:al-Hadi: He is a son of a harlot. I will not do it for him.

:Khayzuran: Then I will never ask you for any more favours.

:al-Hadi: I do not care.

:al-Hadi continued:&quot;Wait a moment and listen well to my words.. Whoever from among my entourage - my generals, my servants - comes to you with a petition will have his head cut off and his property confiscated. What is the meaning of those retinues that throng around your door every day? Don&#x27;t you have a spindle to keep you busy, a Koran for praying, a residence in which to hide from those besieging you? Watch yourself, and woe to you if you open your mouth in favour of anyone at all.&quot;
Khayzuran departed in absolute anger, and never had any words with him again, sweet or bitter. This situation between the royal mother and her son was never resolved and it remained an open wound. Al-Tabari says others refer to al-Hadi&#x27;s overtures to Harun. One account al-Tabari cites has al-Hadi attempting to poison his mother:
:&quot;Yahya b. al-Hasan related that his father transmitted the information to him, saying: I heard Kalisah telling al-&#x27;Abbas b. al-Fadl b. al-Rabi that Musa sent to his mother al-Khayzuran a dish of rice, saying, &quot;I found this tasty and accordingly ate some of it, so you have some too!&quot; Khalisah related: But I said to her, &quot;Don&#x27;t touch it until you investigate further, for I am afraid that it might contain something to your detriment.&quot; So they brought in a dog; it ate some and fell down dead. Musa sent to al-Khayzuran afterwards and said, &quot;How did you like the dish of rice?&quot; She replied, &quot;I enjoyed it very much.&quot; He said, &quot;You can&#x27;t have eaten it, because if you had, I would have been rid of you. When was any Caliph happy who had a mother (still alive)?&quot; (v. 30 pp. 43–44)

Al-Hadi moved his capital from Baghdad to Haditha shortly before his death.

Al-Hadi died in Baghdad at the age of 26 in 786, after ruling for only a year and two months. His brother, Harun al-Rashid, performed his funeral prayer. He was buried in &#x27;Isa Abad. Al-Tabari notes varying accounts of this death, e.g. an abdominal ulcer or assassination prompted by al-Hadi&#x27;s own mother. The note on p. 42 of volume 30 of the SUNY translation of al-Tabari cites pp. 288–289 of the Kitab al-&#x27;Uyun for the possibility that al-Khayzuran feared al-Hadi would recover from his illness and thus had slave girls suffocate him. Al-Tabari (v. 30 pp. 42f) notes al-Hadi&#x27;s assertion of independence from his mother, his forbidding her further involvement in public affairs and his threatening Harun&#x27;s succession. This note continues, &quot;Certainly, his death appears as too opportune for so many people concerned that it should have been a natural one.&quot; The famous Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun discredited this claim.

==Military activities==
His short reign was fraught with numerous military conflicts. The revolt of Husayn ibn Ali ibn Hasan broke out when Husayn declared himself caliph in Medina.

Shortly after caliph al-Mahdi died in July 785, Husayn and his followers rose in revolt at Medina, hoping to take advantage of the as yet unstable position of al-Mahdi&#x27;s successor, al-Hadi. Probably on 16 May 786, Husayn and his fellow conspirators tried to seize control of Medina. At the Mosque of the Prophet, Husayn took the pulpit, symbolically dressed in white and wearing a white turban, and received the allegiance of is followers, with the laqab of , &#x27;the One pleasing to God from the house of Muhammad&#x27;.

The rebels failed to rally the ordinary people to their cause, however, and were quickly confronted by the local garrison. Over the following days, the partisans of the Alids (, the &#x27;wearers of white&#x27;) and the Abbasids (, the &#x27;wearers of black&#x27;) clashed repeatedly, but the latter emerged victorious, confining the Alids and their partisans to the precinct of the Great Mosque. With his uprising clearly a failure, Husayn left the city for Mecca on 28 May, with some 300 followers.

On 11 June 786, at the wadi of , some northwest of Mecca, Husayn&#x27;s small force encountered the Abbasid army, under the command of a number of Abbasid princes who had been present in the city with their armed retinues for the Hajj. In the ensuing battle, Husayn and over a hundred of his followers were killed, and many taken prisoner. Many Alids managed to escape the battle by mingling with the Hajj pilgrims. Among them were Idris and Yahya, the brothers of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya.

Al-Hadi crushed the rebellion and killed Husayn and many of his followers but Idris bin Abdallah, a cousin of Husayn, escaped and aided by Wadih, the Egyptian postal manager, reached coastal Maghreb. where he later founded the Idrisi state in 788.

Al-Hadi also crushed a Kharijite rebellion and repelled a Byzantine invasion. The Abbasid armies actually seized some territory from the latter.

==Family==
Al-Hadi had two wives. One was Lubabah, the daughter of Ja&#x27;far, son of Caliph al-Mansur. The second was Ubaidah, daughter of Ghitrif ibn Atta and thus the niece of Al-Khayzuran bint Atta (Ghitrif ibn Atta&#x27;s sister). One of his concubines was Ghadir also known as Amat-al-Aziz, who had belonged to Rabi ibn Yunus, the powerful and ambitious chamberlain of caliphs al-Mansur and al-Mahdi. She was first presented to al-Mahdi, who, inturn presented her to al-Hadi. She was his favourite concubine, and bore him his two oldest sons. After al-Hadi&#x27;s death Harun al-Rashid married her. Another concubine was Rahim, who was the mother of his son, Ja&#x27;far. Another concubine was Hilanah. After al-Hadi&#x27;s death, she became a concubine of his brother Harun al-Rashid. His other sons were al-Abbas, Abdallah, Ishaq, Isma&#x27;il, Sulayman and Musa. Of the two daughters, one was Umm Isa, who married Caliph al-Mamun, and the other was Umm al-Abbas, who was nicknamed Nunah. All of them were born of concubines. His two sons, Isma&#x27;il and Ja&#x27;far married Harun-Rashid&#x27;s daughters, Hamdunah and Fatimah respectively.

==Succession==
The historian al-Tabari notes varying accounts of al-Hadi&#x27;s death, e.g. an abdominal ulcer or assassination prompted by al-Hadi&#x27;s own mother.

Al-Hadi was succeeded by his younger brother, Harun al-Rashid. Upon his accession, Harun led Friday prayers in Baghdad&#x27;s Great Mosque and then sat publicly as officials and the layman alike lined up to swear allegiance and declare their happiness at his ascent to Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin. He began his reign by appointing very able ministers, who carried on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved the condition of the people.

<text>Lagos (; ) is a city and municipality at the mouth of Bensafrim River and along the Atlantic Ocean, in the Barlavento region of the Algarve, in southern Portugal. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 31,049, in an area of 212.99 km2. The city of Lagos proper (which includes only the civil parish of São Sebastião e Santa Maria) has a population of approximately 22,000. Typically, these numbers increase during the summer months, with the influx of visiting tourists and seasonal residents. While the majority of the population lives along the coast and works in tourism and services, the inland region is sparsely inhabited, with the majority of the people working in agriculture and forestry.

Lagos is one of the most visited cities in the Algarve and Portugal, due to its variety of tourist-friendly beaches, rock formations (Ponta da Piedade), bars, restaurants and hotels, renowned for its vibrant summer nightlife and parties. Yet, Lagos is also a historic centre of the Portuguese Age of Discovery, frequent home of Henry the Navigator, historical shipyard and, at one time, centre of the European slave trade. In 2012, travel website TripAdvisor, classified Lagos as the number one travel destination, on a list of &quot;15 destinations on the rise&quot; worldwide.

Lagos, Nigeria may have been named after it since, at the time of the 15th century, Lagos, Portugal, was the main centre of Portuguese maritime expeditions down the African coast.

==History==

Lagos is an ancient maritime town with more than 2000 years of history. The name &quot;Lagos&quot; comes from a Celtic settlement, derived from the Latin &quot;Lacobriga&quot;, the name of the settlement was established during the pre-Punic civilizations. It became an early settlement of the Carthaginians, who recruited Celtic tribesmen in their war against the Romans (the Punic Wars). Owing to its already important harbour, it was colonized by the Romans and integrated into the Roman province of Lusitania, becoming known as Lacobriga. Quintus Sertorius, a rebellious Roman general, helped by the Lusitanians of Lacobriga (who had been oppressed under Roman Generals and members of Lucius Cornelius Sulla party), successfully defeated the Roman army of Caecilius Metellus Pius probably at nearby Monte Molião.

With the fall of Rome, the town of Lagos was occupied in the sixth century by the Visigoths from the Kingdom of Toledo and later by the Byzantines.
The Moors arrived in the 8th century from North Africa, renaming the settlement &quot;Zawaia&quot; (meaning &quot;lago&quot;, or &quot;lake&quot;). It became part of the much larger coastal region of &quot;al-Gharb&quot;, which eventually became known as the &quot;Algarve&quot;. The Moors fortified the town with Lagos Castle and established important trade links to Northern Africa from their bases in the Iberian peninsula. In 1174, the local wālī gave permission for the Christian peoples to construct a church dedicated to São João Baptista, which was built outside the town&#x27;s walls (becoming the oldest church in the Algarve).

===Kingdom===
Even as King Afonso Henriques advanced to the south, the Christian Reconquista never made it into Algarve and Alentejo, and the south remained under Moorish control. King Sancho I, with the support of Crusader forces used Lagos as a stepping stone to attack the fortress of Alvôr. Zawaia was eventually captured by King Afonso III of Portugal in 1241, but was only taken definitively in 1249. From this period on the King began self-styling himself as the &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarve&quot;, stressing the fact that the Algarve (which had for so long been ruled by the Moors as a foreign country) had been annexed into the dominion of the Portuguese.
Lagos became an independent jurisdiction under the rule of King Peter I in 1361.

King John I assembled his fleet in the harbour of Lagos, before setting sail for the siege and conquest of the city of Ceuta in 1415. This was the first step in opening the Muslim world to medieval Europe, which in fact led to the Age of Discovery with Portuguese explorers sailing across the whole world. By the 15th century, Lagos became the centre of Portuguese maritime exploration, with ships ordered south to trace the shoreline of Africa in order to find routes to India. Infante Henry the Navigator, third son of King John, lived most of the time in Lagos. From here he directed expeditions to Morocco and to the western coast of Africa with caravels, lateen-rigged ships with excellent seafaring capabilities. Lagos was also the home port for Gil Eanes who was the first to sail beyond Cape Bojador in 1434, after a failed attempt in 1433 that put him out of favour with the, then considered the end of the world. The act of rounding the Cape, much like the later rounding of the Cape of Good Hope, permitted Eanes (and the navigators that followed) to advance into the African subcontinent. When, by 1443, Lançarote (then fiscal officer of the crown) had sailed as far as Arguim and brought back 275 Africans, the Portuguese had sufficient slaves to relieve the perpetual handicap of agricultural labour.

Over the following decades, news of discoveries and achievements, and ships loaded with spices and goods would flow into the port of Lagos. It was also the gateway for the first African slaves into post-medieval Europe. Even before Africa was opened-up to the Portuguese, the seamen of Lagos were already unscrupulous slave traders. From the first slave markets in Lagos (the &quot;Mercado de Escravos&quot;, which opened in 1444), many Africans were dispersed throughout Europe, bringing a considerable income to the Portuguese monarchy and merchant classes, as well as cheap labour force. As the major sponsor of these expeditions, Prince Henry received one-fifth of the selling price of every slave. The demand for the indentured labour force was so high that, by 1450, profit on Mauritanian slaves was 700 percent. The discovery of gold by Alfonso Gonçales also increased activities in Lagos, whose residents petitioned the Infante Henry to establish a trading company to pursue gold deposits in the region. This included Juan Dias (ancestor of Bartolomeu Dias who rounded the Cape of Good Hope), Gil Eanes, Lançarote de Freitas, Estevan Alfonso and Rodrigo Alvarez, who provisioned a squadron of six caravels to travel to isle of Garças in 1444, but returned with 150 Africans.

Following the death of Prince Henry, and the expansion into the Atlantic and New World, the port of Lagos continued to receive shipments of goods and slaves, but its role began to decrease. Lisbon began to prosper, with ships returning directly from the colonies of the Azores, Madeira and Brazil, while trading houses began to relocate to the capital. But, even as the wealth arrived in Lisbon and Lagos, the ostentation was widely on display in the royal residences.

King Sebastian, obsessed with his plans for a great crusade against the Kingdom of Fez, assembled a huge fleet in Lagos in 1578. During this ill-fated attempt he and most of Portugal&#x27;s nobility were killed in the Battle of Ksar El Kebir in Morocco, eventually causing a succession crisis, that eventually resulted in the Iberian Union.

When Portugal came under Spanish rule, the Portuguese coast became a target for the English fleet. Lagos, close to the Spanish naval base of Cádiz, was attacked by Sir Francis Drake in the late 1580s, but was defended by its inhabitants, resulting in Drakes sack of Faro. But, the coast was under regular attack of other pirates and corsairs, in addition to the Spanish who bombarded the Algarve during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640–1668), which led to the construction of a string of forts all along the coast. One of them was the late-17th-century &quot;Fort of Ponta da Bandeira&quot; in Lagos, which was completed between 1679 and 1690 (according to the stone inscription over the main door).

From 1576 to 1755, Lagos was a high-profile capital of the Algarve, until the old Portuguese town was destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami of 1755. Although some walls from the 16th century still remain, as well as the governor&#x27;s castle, many of the buildings are from the 17th century.

Two well-known naval battles took place off Lagos, reflecting its strategic location: in the Battle of Lagos (1693) a French flotilla defeated a combined Anglo-Dutch force, while in the Battle of Lagos (1759) a British force defeated a French force.

==Geography==


===Physical geography===
By its geographical position (east-northeast to west-southwest orientation) and lithological diversity, the Algarve stands out as a unique stratigraphic and morpho-tectonic region. A peripheral Carboniferous unit of the Variscan orogeny, it constitutes the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary layers, deposited onto two totally distinct superimposed basins. Between the Middle-Upper Triassic to Hettangian, sediments evolved from continental (fluvial red sandstone) to shallow marine over the entire region, which included instances of evaporates, tholeiite fissural magmas, lava flows, volcanic ash and pyroclasts.

The area of Lagos, conforms to the Middle Miocene Lagos-Portimão formation (a band that extends along the coast from Lagos to Albufeira, abutting the Serra do Caldeirão to the north) and which corresponds to marine sedimentation over relatively stable, but a minorly deformed limestone shelf platform. A period of calm during the intra-Miocene (of approximately 2.4 Ma) led to generalized exposure and development of karst, that influences the present day coastline. The conspicuous horizontal bending of this profile in the cliffs of Lagos, much like the remainder of the Lagos-Portimão formation, is formed by alternating bands of siliciclastic and calcareous lithologies. The low degree of cementation in the layers causes a high degree of instability of the cliffs. The littoral and cliff sands are dominated by various bivalve organisms, bryozoans, larger benthic foraminifers and Coralline algae with minor additions of echinoids and balanids implying a shallow-water depositional system of a warm-temperate climatic regime. The locality of Cerro das Mós, from where a large crocodilian (&quot;Tomistoma schlegelii&quot;) tooth was collected long ago, has also produced some Odontoceti teeth. These may be dated from the Serravallian, which, constitute the oldest marine mammal occurrence in the Algarve.

===Climate===
Lagos has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Like the rest of the Algarve, Lagos is very sunny, averaging over 3100 hours of sunshine a year. Precipitation is concentrated in the winter months, where highs average around and lows around , wind and humidity are also more prevalent during this season, averaging of wind and around 80 percent humidity. Summers are warm to hot, very sunny and generally still, the coastal sea breeze helps to cool down the often excessive heat of this season.

Sea temperatures have little seasonal variation and are their highest in September-October and their lowest in March, averaging in the summer, and in the winter.

===Ecoregions/Protected areas===
Lagos has many natural interest sites, including:
* &quot;Ponta da Piedade&quot; ()
* &quot;Grutas da Costa d&#x27;Oiro&quot; ()
* &quot;Laguna de Alvor&quot; ()
*&quot;Bravura Dam&quot; )
* &quot;Mata Nacional de Barão de S.João&quot; (), representing a varied flora that includes Pine (&quot;Pinaceae&quot;), Acacia (&quot;Acacia&quot;), Eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus&quot;) and Strawberry trees (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;), with six pedestrian trails and six campsites. In the zone of Pedra Branca, is a Paleolithic menhir, called the Menhir of Pedro do Galo, accessible through the pedestrian trails, visitors can use the tables and picnicking areas near the guardhouse for barbecues, while small children have access to a playground. A public sports field and 100 metre interval obstacle course was also constructed to attract activity, near the picnic area.

====Beaches====

* &quot;Meia Praia&quot; (&quot;Half Beach&quot;) —the most popular tourist beach, consisting of soft, white sand, Meia Praia is one of the largest open bays in Europe, resulting in calm seas, permitting conditions for many nautical sports, while cliffs provide sheltered coves from strong windy conditions;
* &quot;Praia Solaria&quot; (&quot;Sunny Beach&quot;);
* &quot;Praia da Batata&quot; (&quot;Potato Beach&quot;) — a small beach tucked between two small cliffs (where the river meets the Atlantic Ocean). It is known for the small music festivals that take place there during summer;
* &quot;Praia dos Estudantes&quot; (&quot;Students&#x27; Beach&quot;);
* &quot;Praia da Dona Ana&quot; (&quot;Dona Ana Beach&quot;) - its areal is slightly thicker than the beaches in the surrounding area and it is surrounded by striking rock formations. At high tide the beach is split by the geomorphology of the cliffs;
* &quot;Praia do Canavial&quot; (&quot;Canavial Beach&quot;);
* &quot;Praia de Camilo&quot; (&quot;Camilo Beach&quot;);
* &quot;Praia da Luz&quot; (&quot;Beach of Light&quot;) - located in the parish of Luz, the beach is bounded in the east by &quot;Rocha Negra&quot; (), providing summer vacationers with a popular escape.
* &quot;Praia da Balança&quot;- located after &quot;Praia da Boneca&quot; and &quot;Praia dos Pinheiros&quot;, it is a sandy cove enclosed by towering cliffs.

==Sustainable tourism==
In 2012 Lagos received the QualityCoast Gold Award for its efforts to become a sustainable tourism destination. Because of this award, Lagos has been selected for inclusion in the global atlas for sustainable tourism DestiNet.


==Human geography==
The municipality of Lagos is located approximately east of the Cape St. Vincent coast, along the southern coast of the Algarve. It is surrounded along its borders by the municipalities of Vila do Bispo (to the west), Aljezur (to the northwest), Monchique (to the northeast) and Portimão (to the east).

To the north of Lagos is the road to Silves, the first capital of the Algarve, Monchique (spa town/mountain), Milfontes, a coastal town and port/harbour of the city of Sines, that winds through the scenic protected landscape of the Southwest Natural Park (Costa Sudoeste Alentejana e Vicentina).

Administratively, the municipality is divided into four civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Bensafrim e Barão de São João
* São Gonçalo de Lagos (São Sebastião e Santa Maria)
* Luz, which includes the separate villages of Almádena and Espiche.
* Odiáxere

==Economy==
Lagos&#x27; economy, like many coastal towns in Portugal, has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since very ancient times. Since 1960, the city has embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. It has beautiful beaches, good climate, the sea, a scenic coastline, and historical patrimony.

The Marina de Lagos has 460 berths and has become an important centre for long-distance cruisers, and it is also known for its modern drawbridge.

Lagos also has numerous cultural and night-life entertainment venues.

<doc id="438151" wikidata="Q221096" url="?curid=438151" title="Public–private partnership">
<text>A public–private partnership (PPP, 3P, or P3) is a long-term arrangement between a government and private sector institutions. Typically, it involves private capital financing government projects and services up-front, and then drawing revenues from taxpayers and/or users for profit over the course of the PPP contract. Public–private partnerships have been implemented in multiple countries and are primarily used for infrastructure projects. Although they are not compulsory, PPPs have been employed for building, equipping, operating and maintaining schools, hospitals, transport systems, and water and sewerage systems.

Cooperation between private actors, corporations and governments has existed since the inception of sovereign states, notably for the purpose of tax collection and colonization. Contemporary &quot;public–private partnerships&quot; came into being around the end of the 20th century. They were aimed at increasing the private sector&#x27;s involvement in public administration. They were seen by governments around the world as a method of financing new or refurbished public sector assets outside their balance sheet. While PPP financing comes from the private sector, these projects are always paid for either through taxes or by users of the service, or a mix of both. PPPs are structurally more expensive than publicly financed projects because of the private sector&#x27;s higher cost of borrowing, resulting in users or taxpayers footing the bill for disproportionately high interest costs. PPPs also have high transaction costs.

PPPs are controversial as funding tools, largely over concerns that public return on investment is lower than returns for the private funder. PPPs are closely related to concepts such as privatization and the contracting out of government services. The secrecy surrounding their financial details complexifies the process of evaluating whether PPPs have been successful. PPP advocates highlight the sharing of risk and the development of innovation, while critics decry their higher costs and issues of accountability. Evidence of PPP performance in terms of value for money and efficiency, for example, is mixed and often unavailable.

==Definition==

There is no consensus about how to define a PPP. The term can cover hundreds of different types of long-term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations, funding arrangements, and transparency requirements. The advancement of PPPs, as a concept and a practice, is a product of the new public management of the late 20th century, the rise of neoliberalism, and globalization pressures. Despite there being no formal consensus regarding a definition, the term has been defined by major entities.

For example, The OECD formally defines public–private partnerships as &quot;long term contractual arrangements between the government and a private partner whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the associated risks&quot;.

According to David L. Weimer and Aidan R. Vining, &quot;A P3 typically involves a private entity financing, constructing, or managing a project in return for a promised stream of payments directly from government or indirectly from users over the projected life of the project or some other specified period of time&quot;.

A 2013 study published in &quot;State and Local Government Review&quot; found that definitions of public-private partnerships vary widely between municipalities: &quot;Many public and private officials tout public–private partnerships for any number of activities, when in truth the relationship is contractual, a franchise, or the load shedding of some previously public service to a private or nonprofit entity.&quot; A more general term for such agreements is &quot;shared service delivery&quot;, in which public-sector entities join with private firms or non-profit organizations to provide services to citizens.

===Debate on privatization===

There is a semantic debate pertaining to whether public–private partnerships constitute privatization or not. Some argue that it isn&#x27;t &quot;privatization&quot; because the government retains ownership of the facility and/or remains responsible for public service delivery. Others argue that they exist on a continuum of privatization, P3s being a more limited form of privatization than the outright sale of public assets, but more extensive than simply contracting out government services.

Because &quot;privatization&quot; has a negative connotation in some circles, supporters of P3s generally take the position that P3s do not constitute privatization, while P3 opponents argue that they do. The Canadian Union of Public Employees describes P3s as &quot;privatization by stealth&quot;.

== Origins ==

Governments have used such a mix of public and private endeavors throughout history.

Muhammad Ali of Egypt utilized &quot;concessions&quot; in the early 1800s to obtain public works for minimal cost while the concessionaires&#x27; companies made most of the profits from projects such as railroads and dams. Much of the early infrastructure of the United States was built by what can be considered public–private partnerships. This includes the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike road in Pennsylvania, which was initiated in 1792, an early steamboat line between New York and New Jersey in 1808; many of the railroads, including the nation&#x27;s first railroad, chartered in New Jersey in 1815; and most of the modern electric grid. In Newfoundland, Robert Gillespie Reid contracted to operate the railways for fifty years from 1898, though originally they were to become his property at the end of the period.

The late 20th and early 21st century saw a clear trend toward governments across the globe making greater use of various PPP arrangements. Pressure to change the model of public procurement was associated with the neoliberal turn. Instigators of the policy portrayed PPPs as a solution to concerns about the growing level of public debt during the 1970s and 1980s. They sought to encourage private investment in infrastructure, initially on the basis of ideology and accounting fallacies arising from the fact that public accounts did not distinguish between recurrent and capital expenditures.

In 1992, the Conservative government of John Major in the United Kingdom introduced the Private finance initiative (PFI), the first systematic program aimed at encouraging public–private partnerships. The 1992 program focused on reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement, although, as already noted, the effect on public accounts was largely illusory. Initially, the private sector was unenthusiastic about PFI, and the public sector was opposed to its implementation. In 1993, the Chancellor of the Exchequer described its progress as &quot;disappointingly slow&quot;. To help promote and implement the policy, Major created institutions staffed with people linked with the City of London, accountancy and consultancy firms who had a vested interest in the success of PFI. 

Around the same time, PPPs were being initiated haphazardly in various OECD countries. The first governments to implement them were ideologically neoliberal and short on revenues: they were thus politically and fiscally inclined to try out alternative forms of public procurement. These early PPP projects were usually pitched by wealthy and politically connected business magnates. This explains why each countries experimenting with PPPs started in different sectors. At that time, PPPs were seen as a radical reform of government service provision.

In 1997, the new British government of Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Party expanded the PFI but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of &quot;value for money&quot;, mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk. Blair created Partnerships UK (PUK), a new semi-independent organization to replace the previous pro-PPP government institutions. Its mandate was to promote and implement PFI. PUK was central in making PPPs the &quot;new normal&quot; for public infrastructure procurements in the country. Multiple countries subsequently created similar PPP units based on PUK&#x27;s model.

While initiated in first world countries, PPPs immediately received significant attention in developing countries. This is because the PPP model promised to bring new sources of funding for infrastructure projects in transition economies, which could translate into jobs and economic growth. However, the lack of investor rights guarantees, commercial confidentiality laws, and dedicated state spending on public infrastructure in these countries made the implementation of public–private partnership in transition economies difficult. PPPs in the countries usually can&#x27;t rely on stable revenues from user fees either. The World Bank&#x27;s Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Forum attempts to mitigate these challenges.

==Funding==
A defining aspect of many infrastructure P3s is that most of the up-front financing is made through the private sector. The way this financing is done differs significantly by country. For P3s in the UK, bonds are used rather than bank loans. In Canada, P3 projects usually use loans that must be repaid within five years, and the projects are refinanced at a later date. In some types of public–private partnership, the cost of using the service is borne exclusively by the users of the service, for example, by toll road users such as in the case of Toronto&#x27;s Yonge Street at the dawn of the 19th century, and the more recent Highway 407 in Ontario. In other types (notably the PFI), capital investment is made by the private sector on the basis of a contract with the government to provide agreed-on services, and the cost of providing the services is borne wholly or in part by the government.

=== Special purpose vehicle ===

Typically, a private-sector consortium forms a special company called a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop, build, maintain, and operate the asset for the contracted period. In cases where the government has invested in the project, it is typically (but not always) allotted an equity share in the SPV. The consortium is usually made up of a building contractor, a maintenance company, and one or more equity investors. The two former are typically equity holders in the project, who make decisions but are only repaid when the debts are paid, while the latter is the project&#x27;s creditor (debt holder).

It is the SPV that signs the contract with the government and with subcontractors to build the facility and then maintain it. A typical PPP example would be a hospital building financed and constructed by a private developer and then leased to the hospital authority. The private developer then acts as landlord, providing housekeeping and other non-medical services, while the hospital itself provides medical services.

The SPV links the firms responsible of the building phase and the operating phase together. Hence there is a strong incentives in the building stage to make investments with regard to the operating stage. These investments can be desirable but may also be undesirable (e.g., when the investments not only reduce operating costs but also reduce service quality).

=== Financial partners ===
Public infrastructure is a relatively low-risk, high-reward investment, and combining it with complex arrangements and contracts that guarantee and secure the cash flows make PPP projects prime candidates for project financing. The equity investors in SPVs are usually institutional investors such as pension funds, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth and superannuation funds, and banks. Major P3 investors include AustralianSuper, OMERS and Dutch state-owned bank ABN AMRO, which funded the majority of P3 projects in Australia. Wall Street firms have increased their interest in PPP since the 2008 financial crisis.

=== Government ===
Government sometimes make in kind contributions to a PPP, notably with the transfer of existing assets. In projects that are aimed at creating public goods, like in the infrastructure sector, the government may provide a capital subsidy in the form of a one-time grant so as to make the project economically viable. In other cases, the government may support the project by providing revenue subsidies, including tax breaks or by guaranteed annual revenues for a fixed period.

===Risks===
Within public-private partnerships (PPPs), there are various risks associated. One risk common within PPPs is the lack of proper or accurate cost evaluation. Oftentimes the estimated costs of a project will not properly account for delays or unexpected events, leading to the costs to be larger than what was projected. Another risk within this area is with change of governance from differing political representatives could lead to projects being diminished or reduction of the allocated budget. This is common within PPPs as different political actors are likely to scrutinise their opponents based on their ideological positions.

=== Profits ===
Private monopolies created by PPPs can generate a rent-seeking behavior, which leads to spiraling costs for users and/or taxpayers in the operation phase of the project.

Some public–private partnerships, when the development of new technologies is involved, include profit-sharing agreements. This generally involves splitting revenues between the inventor and the public once a technology is commercialized. Profit-sharing agreements may stand over a fixed period of time or in perpetuity.

== P3 justifications ==
Using PPPs have been justified in various ways over time. Advocates generally argue that PPPs enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies that the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and delivered by the public sector. On the other hand, critics suggest that PPPs are part of an ideological program that seeks to privatize public services for the profits of private entities.

=== Off-balance-sheet accounting ===
PPPs are often structured so that borrowing for the project does not appear on the balance sheet of the public-sector body seeking to make a capital investment. Rather, the borrowing is incurred by the private-sector vehicle implementing the project, with or without an explicit backup guarantee of the loan by the public body. On PPP projects where the cost of using the service is intended to be borne exclusively by the end-user, or through a lease billed to the government every year during the operation phase of the project, the PPP is, from the public sector&#x27;s perspective, an &quot;off-balance sheet&quot; method of financing the delivery of new or refurbished public-sector assets.

This justification was particularly important during the 1990s, but has been exposed as an accounting trick designed to make the government of the day appear more fiscally responsible, while offloading the costs of their projects to service users or future governments. In Canada, many auditors general have condemned this practice, and forced governments to include PPP projects &quot;on-balance sheet&quot;.

On PPP projects where the public sector intends to compensate the private sector through availability payments once the facility is established or renewed, the financing is, from the public sector&#x27;s perspective, &quot;on-balance sheet&quot;. According to PPP advocates, the public sector will regularly benefit from significantly deferred cash flows. This viewpoint has been contested through research that shows that a majority of PPP projects ultimately cost significantly more than traditional public ones.

In the European Union, the fact that PPP debt is not recorded as debt and remains largely &quot;off-balance-sheet&quot; has become a major concern. Indeed, keeping the PPP project and its contingent liabilities &quot;off balance sheet&quot; means that the true cost of the project is hidden. According to the International Monetary Fund, economic ownership of the asset should determine whether to record PPP-related assets and liabilities in the government&#x27;s or the private corporation&#x27;s balance sheet is not straightforward.

===Project costs===

The effectiveness of PPPs as cost-saving venture has been refuted by numerous studies. Research has showed that on average, governments pay more for PPPs projects than for traditional publicly financed projects. The higher cost of P3s is attributed to these systemic factors:
*The private sector&#x27;s higher cost of capital: governments can typically borrow capital at an interest rate lower than any private company ever could. This is because governments have the power of taxation, which guarantees that they will be able to repay their debts. Since lending to governments almost always come at a lower risk than lending to private entities, governments get better credit and cheaper financing costs for building large infrastructure projects than private finance.
*Transaction costs: P3 contracts are much more complex and extensive than contracts made in traditional publicly financed projects. The negotiation of these contracts require the presence of lawyers on all sides of the table and can take months or even years to finalize. Barrie Mckenna reports that &quot;transaction costs for lawyers and consultants [in P3s] add about 3 percent to the final bill.&quot;
*Operating profits: Private companies that engage in P3s expect a return on investment after the completion of the project. By financing PPPs, they partner engages in low-risk speculation. Over the course of the contract, the private partner can charge the end-users and/or the government for more money than the cost of the initial investment.

Sometimes, private partners manage to overcome these costs and provide a project cheaper for taxpayers. This can be done by cutting corners, designing the project so as to be more profitable in the operational phase, charging user fees, and/or monetizing aspects of the projects not covered by the contract. For P3 schools in Nova Scotia, this latter aspect has included restricting the use of schools&#x27; fields and interior walls, and charging after-hours facility access to community groups at 10 times the rate of non-P3 schools.

In Ontario, a 2012 review of 28 projects showed that the costs were on average 16% lower for traditional publicly procured projects than for PPPs. A 2014 report by the Auditor General of Ontario said that the province overpaid by $8 billion through PPPs.

===Value for money===

In response to these negative findings about the costs and quality of P3 projects, proponents developed formal procedures for the assessment of PPPs which focused heavily on value for money. Heather Whiteside defines P3 &quot;Value for money&quot; as:
Not to be confused with lower overall project costs, value for money is a concept used to evaluate P3 private-partner bids against a hypothetical public sector comparator designed to approximate the costs of a fully public option (in terms of design, construction, financing, and operations). P3 value for money calculations consider a range of costs, the exact nature of which has changed over time and varies by jurisdiction. One thing that does remain consistent, however, is the favoring of &quot;risk transfer&quot; to the private partner, to the detriment of the public sector comparator.Value for money assessment procedures were incorporated into the PFI and its Australian and Canadian counterparts beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A 2012 study showed that value-for-money frameworks were still inadequate as an effective method of evaluating PPP proposals. The problem is that it is unclear what the catchy term &quot;value-for-money&quot; means in the technical details relating to their practical implementation. A Scottish auditor once qualified this use of the term as &quot;technocratic mumbo-jumbo&quot;.

Project promoters often contract a PPP unit or one of the Big Four accounting firms to conduct the value for money assessments. Because these firms also offer PPP consultancy services, they have a vested interest in recommending the PPP option over the traditional public procurement method. The lack of transparency surrounding individual PPP projects makes it difficult to draft independent value-for-money assessments.

A number of Australian studies of early initiatives to promote private investment in infrastructure concluded that in most cases, the schemes being proposed were inferior to the standard model of public procurement based on competitively tendered construction of publicly owned assets. In 2009, the New Zealand Treasury, in response to inquiries by the new National Party government, released a report on PPP schemes that concluded that &quot;there is little reliable empirical evidence about the costs and benefits of PPPs&quot; and that there &quot;are other ways of obtaining private sector finance&quot;, as well as that &quot;the advantages of PPPs must be weighed against the contractual complexities and rigidities they entail&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, many private finance initiative programs ran dramatically over budget and have not provided value for money for the taxpayer, with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete. An in-depth study conducted by the National Audit Office of the United Kingdom concluded that the private finance initiative model had proved to be more expensive and less efficient in supporting hospitals, schools, and other public infrastructure than public financing. A treasury select committee stated that &#x27;PFI was no more efficient than other forms of borrowing and it was &quot;illusory&quot; that it shielded the taxpayer from risk&#x27;.

===Transfer of risk===

One of the main rationales for P3s is that they provide for a transfer of risk: the Private partner assumes the risks in case of cost overruns or project failures. Methods for assessing value-for-money rely heavily on risk transfers to show the superiority of P3s. However, P3s do not inherently reduce risk, they simply reassign who is responsible, and the Private sector assumes that risk at a cost for the taxpayer. If the value of the risk transfer is appraised too high, then the government is overpaying for P3 projects.

Incidentally, a 2018 UK Parliament report underlines that some private investors have made large returns from PPP deals, suggesting that departments are overpaying for transferring the risks of projects to the private sector, one of the Treasury&#x27;s stated benefits of PPP.

Supporters of P3s claim that risk is successfully transferred from public to private sectors as a result of P3, and that the private sector is better at risk management. As an example of successful risk transfer, they cite the case of the National Physical Laboratory. This deal ultimately caused the collapse of the building contractor Laser (a joint venture between Serco and John Laing) when the cost of the complex scientific laboratory, which was ultimately built, was very much larger than estimated.

On the other hand, Allyson Pollock argues that in many PFI projects risks are not in fact transferred to the private sector and, based on the research findings of Pollock and others, George Monbiot argues that the calculation of risk in PFI projects is highly subjective, and is skewed to favor the private sector:

Following an incident in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh where surgeons were forced to continue a heart operation in the dark following a power cut caused by PFI operating company Consort, Dave Watson from Unison criticized the way the PFI contract operates:

Furthermore, assessments ignore the practices of risk transfers to contractors under traditional procurement methods. As for the idea that the private sector is inherently better at managing risk, there has been no comprehensive study comparing risk management by the public sector and by P3s. Auditor Generals of Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick have publicly questioned P3 rationales based on a transfer of risk, the latter stating he was &quot;unable to develop any substantive evidence supporting risk transfer decisions&quot;. Furthermore, many PPP concessions proved to be unstable and required to be renegotiated to favor the contractor.

== Accountability and transparency ==
One of the main criticisms of public–private partnerships is the lack of accountability and transparency associated with these projects. Part of the reason why evidence of PPP performance is often unavailable is that most financial details of P3s are under the veil of commercial confidentiality provisions, and unavailable to researchers and the public. Around the world, opponents of P3s have launched judicial procedures to access greater P3 project documentation than the limited &quot;bottom line&quot; sheets available on the project&#x27;s websites. When they are successful, the documents they receive are often heavily redacted.

A 2007 survey of U.S. city managers revealed that communities often fail to sufficiently monitor PPPs: &quot;For instance, in 2002, only 47.3% of managers involved with private firms as delivery partners reported that they evaluate that service delivery. By 2007, that was down to 45.4%. Performance monitoring is a general concern from these surveys and in the scholarly criticisms of these arrangements.&quot;

==Sectors==

===Water services===

After a wave of privatization of many water services in the 1990s, mostly in developing countries, experiences show that global water corporations have not brought the promised improvements in public water utilities. Instead of lower prices, large volumes of investment, and improvements in the connection of the poor to water and sanitation, water tariffs have increased out of reach of poor households. Water multinationals are withdrawing from developing countries, and the World Bank is reluctant to provide support.

The privatization of the water services of the city of Paris proved to be unwanted, and at the end of 2009 the city did not renew its contract with two of the French water corporations, Suez and Veolia. After a year of being controlled by the public, it is projected that the water tariff will be cut by between 5% and 10%.

In the 2010s, as wastewater treatment plants across North America came of age and needed to be replaced, multiple cities decided to fund the renewal of their water infrastructure through a public–private partnership. Among those cities were Brandenburg, Kentucky, which was the &quot;first local government in Kentucky to execute a public–private partnership under legislation passed in 2016&quot;, and Regina, Saskatchewan, which held a referendum on the plant&#x27;s funding model. The P3 option won out.&quot;

===Transportation===

Another major sector for P3s is transportation. The P3 Transportation sector can be broadly split into five sectors: airports, ports, roads, railways and urban passenger transport (which includes bus, light rail and heavy rail systems).

Many P3s in the United States have been toll road concessions. Transportation projects have accounted for 1/5 of all P3 projects in Canada. Major transportation P3 projects have included the Confederation Bridge linking Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, the Pocahontas Parkway in Virginia, and the London Underground PPP.

===Health services===

For more than two decades, public–private partnerships have been used to finance health infrastructure. In Canada, they comprise 1/3 of all P3 projects nationwide. Governments have looked to the PPP model in an attempt to solve larger problems in health care delivery. However, some health-care-related PPPs have been shown to cost significantly more money to develop and maintain than those developed through traditional public procurement.

A health services PPP can be described as a long-term contract (typically 15–30 years) between a public-sector authority and one or more private-sector companies operating as a legal entity. In theory, the agreements entails that the government provides purchasing power and outlines goals for an optimal health system. It then contracts a private enterprise to design, build, maintain, and/or manage the delivery of agreed-upon services over the term of the contract. Finally, the private sector receives payment for its services and assumes additional risk while benefitting from returns on its investments during the operational phase.

A criticism of P3s for Hospitals in Canada is that they result in an &quot;internal bifurcation of authority&quot;. This occurs when the facility is operated and maintained by the private sector while the care services are delivered by the public sector. In those cases, the nursing staff cannot request their colleagues from the maintenance staff to clean something (urine, blood, etc.) or to hang workplace safety signs, even if they are standing next to each other, without the approval of the private managers.

In the UK, P3s were used to build hospitals for the National Health Service. In 2017 there were 127 PFI schemes in the English NHS. The contracts vary greatly in size. Most include the cost of running services such as facilities management, hospital portering and patient food, and these amount to around 40% of the cost. Total repayments will cost around £2.1 billion in 2017 and will reach a peak in 2029. This is around 2% of the NHS budget.

===Forestry sector===
PPP options in the forest sector can include joint forest management projects between government agencies, various investors and NGOs. USAID promotes the use of P3s to assist the exploitation of certified timber and non-timber products in Third World countries by foreign companies. They claim forestry PPPs are an agent of nature conservation and the sustainable harvesting of commercialized forest products, notwithstanding the fact that it was competition from foreign companies that forced local producers to engage in unsustainable harvesting practices in the first place. Many forestry sector partnerships with NGOs are nothing more than greenwashing operations.

== Institutional support ==
Aside from the support of national governments and financial firms, PPPs are promoted by the following institutions:

===PPP units===

Public–private partnership units are organizations responsible for promoting, facilitating, and assessing P3s in their territory. They can be government agencies, or semi-independent organizations created with full or part government support. Governments tend to create these units as a response to criticisms of the implementation of P3 projects in their country prior to the creation of the P3 unit. In 2009, 50% of OECD countries had created a centralized PPP unit, and many more of these institutions exist in other countries.

=== Accounting firms ===
The &quot;big four&quot; accounting firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, and KPMG have been involved in the public–private partnership model from its inception. Advisors from these companies have been tapped to develop PPP policies and procedures in multiple countries. These companies then went on to evaluate those procedures, appraise individual projects, and act as a consultants for private and public partners in PPP contract negotiations. Accounting firms sometimes even have an equity stake in projects that they appraise the value for money. Due to these conflict of interests, multiple authors have argues that the &quot;big four&quot;&#x27;s public project appraisals are biased towards the PPP funding option against the traditional procurement model.

=== International institutions ===

The World Bank works to promote public–private partnerships in countries where it operates. The United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goal 17 target 17.17 is formulated as: &quot;Encourage effective partnerships: Encourage and promote effective public, public–private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships.&quot; The success of this target is measured by the amount in United States dollars committed to public–private partnerships for infrastructure worldwide.

=== United States foreign policy ===
The American government seeks to promote public–private partnerships around the globe to meet its various foreign policy goals. USAID promoted PPPs with Global Development Alliances and through the Development Credit Authority, which was merged into the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in 2019. The State department also promotes PPPs through its Office of Global Partnerships.

== Delivery models ==

There are many types and delivery models of PPPs, the following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the designs:

;Operation and maintenance contract (O &amp; M)
:A private economic agent, under a government contract, operates a publicly-owned asset for a specific period of time. Formal, ownership of the asset remains with the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is on the lower end of the spectrum for both involvement and risk.

;Build–finance (BF)
:The private actor builds the asset and finances the cost during the construction period, afterwards the responsibility is handed over to the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is again on the lower end of the spectrum for both measures.

;Build–operate–transfer (BOT)
:Build–operate–transfer represents a complete integration of the project delivery: the same contract governs the design, construction, operations, maintenance, and financing of the project. After some concessionary period, the facility is transferred back to the owner.

;Build–own–operate–transfer (BOOT)
:A BOOT structure differs from BOT in that the private entity owns the works. During the concession period, the private company owns and operates the facility with the prime goal to recover the costs of investment and maintenance while trying to achieve a higher margin on the project. BOOT has been used in projects like highways, roads mass transit, railway transport and power generation.

;Build–own–operate (BOO)
:In a BOO project ownership of the project remains usually with the project company, such as a mobile phone network. Therefore, the private company gets the benefits of any residual value of the project. This framework is used when the physical life of the project coincides with the concession period. A BOO scheme involves large amounts of finance and long payback period. Some examples of BOO projects come from the water treatment plants.

;Build–lease–transfer (BLT)
:Under BLT, a private entity builds a complete project and leases it to the government. In this way the control over the project is transferred from the project owner to a lessee. In other words, the ownership remains by the shareholders but operation purposes are leased. After the expiry of the leasing the ownership of the asset and the operational responsibility is transferred to the government at a previously agreed price.

;Design–build–finance–maintain (DBFM)
:&quot;The private sector designs, builds and finances an asset and provides hard facility management or maintenance services under a long-term agreement.&quot; The owner (usually the public sector) operates the facility. This model is in the middle of the spectrum for private sector risk and involvement.

;Design–build–finance–maintain–operate (DBFMO)
:Design–build–finance–operate is a project delivery method very similar to BOOT except that there is no actual ownership transfer. Moreover, the contractor assumes the risk of financing until the end of the contract period. The owner then assumes the responsibility for maintenance and operation. This model is extensively used in specific infrastructure projects such as toll roads. The private construction company is responsible for the design and construction of a piece of infrastructure for the government, which is the true owner. Moreover, the private entity has the responsibility to raise finance during the construction and the exploitation period. Usually, the public sector begins payments to the private sector for use of the asset post-construction. This is the most commonly used model in the EU according to the European Court of Auditors.

;Design–build–operate–transfer (DBOT)
:This funding option is common when the client has no knowledge of what the project entails. Hence they contracts the project to a company to design, build, operate, and then transfer it. Examples of such projects are refinery constructions.

;Design–construct–manage–finance (DCMF)
:A private entity is entrusted to design, construct, manage, and finance a facility, based on the specifications of the government. Project cash flows result from the government&#x27;s payment for the rent of the facility. Some examples of the DCMF model are prisons or public hospitals.

;Concession
:A concession is a grant of rights, land or property by a government, local authority, corporation, individual or other legal entity. Public services such as water supply may be operated as a concession. In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out investment in a public utility (such as a water privatization) for a given number of years.

== Other types ==
While long-term infrastructure projects compose the bulk of P3s worldwide, other types of Public–private partnerships exist to suit different purposes and actors.

=== Asset monetization ===
A form of P3 that became prevalent in American cities during the 21st century are &quot;asset monetization&quot; arrangements. They concerns a city&#x27;s revenue-generating assets (parking lots, garage and meters, public lights, toll roads, etc.) and transforms them into financial assets that the city can lease to a private corporation in exchange for covering operation and maintenance. These deals are usually done during periods of financial distress for the city, and the immediate revenues municipalities receive is used to pay down the debt or to fill budget holes. The 2014 Detroit bankruptcy deal included many asset monetization arrangements.

===Global public–private partnership===

Global public–private partnership (GPPP) is a governance mechanism to foster public–private partnership (PPP) cooperation between an international intergovernmental organisation like the United Nations and private companies. Existing GPPPs strive, among other things, to increase affordable access to non-generic essential drugs and vaccines in developing countries, and to promote handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhoea.
===Institutionalised public–private partnership===

The European Commission issued an &quot;interpretative communication&quot; in 2008 regarding the establishment of institutionalised public–private partnerships (IPPP), whose formation generally involves simultaneously creating a new jointly-owned public–private entity and the award of a public sector contract or concession whereby the new entity supplies goods or services to the public body or the general public. The Commission acknowledged that separating these two procedures, such that the selection of the private partner and the decision on whether to contract with the new entity were distinct processes, would not be practical, and therefore a &quot;transparent and competitive procedure&quot; through which the private partner was identified and the terms of their involvement in the institutionalised entity could be compliant with treaty obligations and public procurement law. The guidance also noted that, following the establishment of the IPPP entity, it would be free to bid for future public contracts in the same way as other businesses, but particular care would be needed to ensure that the award process remained transparent.

=== Market-led proposal ===

Market-led proposals (MLP) are P3s proposed by the private sector. MLP policies encourage private sector firms to make unsolicited P3 infrastructure project proposals to the government, instead of putting the onus on the state to propose each projects. During the 2010s, MLP policies were implemented in most Australian states and territories. Amy Sarcevic from Informa Australia notes that &quot;to date, market-led proposals have had a relatively high failure rate&quot;.

=== Public–private–community partnerships===
Public–private partnerships with non-profits and private partners, sometimes called Public–private–community partnerships (PPCPs), are a modified version of the PPP model designed for the needs of Third world countries. They were notably proposed by the Asian Development Bank as early as 1991 as an &quot;institutional reform ... to facilitate the participation of individuals, CBOs [community based organizations], other NGOs and the private sector&quot; so that they become &quot;actively involved in planning and management&quot;.

=== Social impact bond ===
Social impact bonds (also called &quot;pay for success&quot; bonds) are &quot;a public–private partnership which funds effective social services through a performance-based contract&quot;, according to Social Finance&#x27;s definition. They operate over a fixed period of time, but they do not offer a fixed rate of return. Generally, repayment to investors is contingent upon a specified social outcome being achieved. A similar system, development impact bonds, is being implemented in developing countries.

<text>The Curtiss A-8 was a low-wing monoplane ground-attack aircraft built by the United States company Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, designed in response to a 1929 United States Army Air Corps requirement for an attack aircraft to replace the A-3 Falcon. The Model 59 &quot;Shrike&quot; was designated XA-8.

==Development==
The XA-8 won a competition against the General Aviation/Fokker XA-7, after which 13 service test aircraft were ordered (five as YA-8s and eight as Y1A-8s). After the completion of testing, 11 of these aircraft were redesignated A-8.

The A-8 was the first Curtiss machine of all-metal low-wing monoplane configuration with advanced features such as automatic leading edge slats and trailing-edge flaps.

Four forward-firing machine guns were mounted in the wheel fairings, and an additional weapon of the same calibre was fitted in the observer&#x27;s cockpit for rear defense. The standard bomb load was four bombs.

One YA-8 was fitted with a radial engine and designated YA-10, while another was used for testing of the Curtiss V-1570 Conqueror engine as the Y1A-8A. This aircraft was redesignated A-8 upon the completion of testing.

46 aircraft were ordered as A-8Bs, however the order was changed to the Model 60 A-12s before production began.

==Operational history==
The A-8 created a sensation in US aviation circles when it went into service with the 3rd Attack Group at Fort Crockett, Texas in April 1932. All other standard aircraft were of biplane configuration, and the first monoplane fighter (the Boeing P-26A) did not become operational until eight months later.

==Variants==

<text>The &quot;Wentworth letter&quot; was a letter written in 1842 by Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, to &quot;Long&quot; John Wentworth, editor and proprietor of the &quot;Chicago Democrat&quot;. It outlined the history of the Latter Day Saint movement up to that time, and included Mormonism&#x27;s Articles of Faith.

The letter was written in response to Wentworth&#x27;s inquiry on behalf of one of his friends, George Barstow, who was writing a history of New Hampshire. The letter was first published on March 1, 1842, in the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; in Nauvoo, Illinois.

A (with some slight revisions) was published by Daniel Rupp in 1844 in a book called &quot;An Original History of the Religious Denominations at Present Existing in the United States&quot;.

==Significance==

The Wentworth Letter is significant for several reasons.

First, it connects the message of what Mormons believe to be the Restoration with the history of said Restoration: &quot;By these things we know...&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 20:1-17)

Second, it emphasizes the First Vision as an essential part of Latter-day Saint message.

Third, it contains the &quot;Standard of Truth&quot;, which has become a mission statement for missionaries:

“Our missionaries are going forth to different nations . . . the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.” (History of the Church 4:540)

Fourth, it ends with the statements which later became the Articles of Faith. B. H. Roberts said of these,
“These Articles of Faith were not produced by the labored efforts and harmonized contentions of scholastics, but were struck off by one inspired mind at a single effort to make a declaration of that which is most assuredly believed by the church, for one making earnest inquiry about the truth.&quot;

&quot;The combined directness, perspicuity, simplicity and comprehensiveness of this statement of the principles of our religion may be relied upon as strong evidence of a divine inspiration resting upon the Prophet, Joseph Smith.” (B. H. Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol.2, Ch.47, p.131)
And finally, the Wentworth letter re-establishes Joseph Smith&#x27;s teachings that the Lamanites are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. In the Wentworth letter we read,

&quot;They were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The principal nation of the second race fell in battle towards the close of the fourth century. &quot;The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country.&quot;&quot; (Wentworth Letter)
==Changes in published versions==

The wording of some of the articles was modified by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement, in 1851 and 1902:

1. The fourth article of faith originally read, “We believe that these ordinances are: 1st. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 2d. Repentance; 3d. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; 4th. Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.”
*It now reads: “We believe that &quot;the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel&quot; are: 1st. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 2d. Repentance; 3d. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; 4th. Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (emphasis added) (&quot;Answers to Gospel Questions&quot; 2:92)

2. The tenth article originally read, “that Zion will be built upon this continent . . .” It was later changed to &quot;that Zion will be built upon this [the American] continent . . .&quot;

3. The eleventh article originally read, &quot;We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our conscience...&quot;
*It now reads: &quot;We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our &quot;own&quot; conscience...&quot;

Joseph Fielding Smith wrote:
“The reason for the adding of the word &quot;principles,&quot; and that is the only change, was because the brethren considered when they were preparing the 1921 edition for publication of the D&amp;C, that the term ordinances did not fully cover the article completely. For instance, &quot;faith&quot; is not an ordinance, neither is &quot;repentance,&quot; but they are principles. Therefore we felt fully justified in making the article so that it would convey clearly just what the Prophet intended. So now it reads: &quot;We believe that the first principles and ordinances are,&quot; and in doing this we were perfectly within the bounds of propriety. Were the Prophet here, he would fully justify our action.”

&quot;We have no apology to make for this addition. We have in no sense destroyed the original meaning.” (&quot;Answers to Gospel Questions&quot; 2:92)

<text>The Community College of Philadelphia (CCP) is a public community college with campuses throughout Philadelphia. The college was founded in 1965 and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It offers over 100 associate degree and certificate programs through its four locations.

CCP&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the Eastern Pennsylvania Athletic Conference (EPAC) of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). They are collectively known as the Lions and have more than 50 championships as current members of the EPAC and members of the former Pennsylvania Collegiate Athletic Association.

==History==

===Early years===
The Community College of Philadelphia was founded in 1965 as a means for the African American and low-income residents of Philadelphia to have access to higher education.

In 1962, the Philadelphia Commission on Higher Education presented their recommendations for the establishment of a community college in Philadelphia, and in 1964, the college was founded in accordance with Pennsylvania legislation. With Dr. Allen T. Bonnell presiding as CCP&#x27;s first and founding president, classes commenced in September 1965 at the site of the former N. Snellenburg &amp; Company department store on South 11th Street. Under Dr. Bonnell&#x27;s leadership, enrollment at the college grew from an initial 1,200 to 4,365 students by 1967.

By 1969, it had reached 6,200. The majority of students entered the workforce upon completion of their programs, while others continued on to four-year institutions. The college initially offered courses in human services, business administration, health occupations and paraprofessional engineering.

By 1971, CCP had acquired the third Philadelphia Mint building (the Mint), located at 1700 Spring Garden Street. CCP began holding classes there in 1973 while continuing to hold classes at the 11th Street location. The construction of Main Campus (the Bonnell and West Buildings) began at 17th and Spring Garden Streets in 1979.

In 1983, CCP&#x27;s $70 million Main Campus was fully constructed around the Mint, which had undergone renovations for new administrative and student facilities. In the spring of that year, CCP&#x27;s 11th Street location was consolidated into the permanent Main Campus.

==Campus==
The college has four locations that offer varying programs. Each location offers a learning commons, science laboratories, computer labs, enrollment services, advising, counseling, and a bookstore.

===Main Campus===
Main Campus is located at 1700 Spring Garden Street in the Spring Garden neighborhood of central Philadelphia. The campus covers and houses seven buildings: the Athletics Center, the Bonnell Building, the Center for Business and Industry, the Mint Building, the Pavilion Building, the West Building and the Winnet Student Life Building.

The Athletics Center is open to all CCP students, faculty and staff. Opened in 1991, it contains an aerobics/dance room, basketball court, racquetball courts, a table tennis room cardio room and a weight room.

The Bonnell Building, the first president&#x27;s namesake, is the largest building on Main Campus. It houses student services and two auditoriums and connects to the Mint Building.

The Center for Business and Industry opened in 2003 and offers high-tech classrooms, conference rooms and office spaces for technology and workforce development programs.

The Mint Building is centrally located on Main Campus. It was the third Philadelphia Mint building, but CCP acquired it and began holding classes there in 1973. It currently houses student services, security and a library.

The Pavilion Building is the newest facility on Main Campus and has ecofriendly features. The building opened in 2011 and is home to the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management programs.

The West Building houses the allied health science and Gateway to College (alternative education) programs, among others. The facility is located at the southwest corner of 17th and Spring Garden streets and connects to the Pavilion Building.

The Winnet Student Life Building includes spaces for student support services, programs and activities.

===Northeast Regional Center===
The Northeast Regional Center is CCP&#x27;s first and largest regional center. It was initially opened in 1985 at Academy and Red Lion Roads in the Morrell Park neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. In 1994, the campus&#x27;s new location became 12901 Townsend Road in the Parkwood neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. The campus underwent renovations and an expansion project that were completed in 2010 and earned a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in 2013.

===Northwest Regional Center===
The Northwest Regional Center is located at 1300 West Godfrey Avenue in the Fern Rock neighborhood of North Philadelphia. The campus acquired the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at 1300 West Godfrey Avenue in 1998 and opened in 1999. The campus contains more than 30 classrooms and is the only location that offers the Ophthalmic Technician Proficiency Certificate program.

===West Regional Center===
The West Regional Center is located at 4725 Chestnut Street in the Walnut Hill neighborhood of West Philadelphia. It opened in 1992 and is three miles from Main Campus. It offers programs in two buildings that contain a combined 25 classrooms. As of 2021, the campus&#x27;s Automotive Technology Center is undergoing construction and is scheduled to open as the Career and Advanced Technology Center in 2022. The expanded two-story facility will include an additional of auto space, incorporate sustainable features and technologies and meet the criteria for LEED certification.

==Administration and organization==
CCP operates under seven academic pathways: Business, Entrepreneurship &amp; Law; Creative Arts; Design, Construction &amp; Transportation; Education &amp; Human Services; Health Care; Liberal Arts and Communications; and Science &amp; Technology.

A typical academic year is broken up into two 15-week terms during the fall (September–December) and spring (January–April). Within the full terms are sessions that span 10 weeks and two accelerated seven-week terms each fall and spring. The full summer term is 13–14 weeks long (May–August) and contains two accelerated terms that each span six to seven weeks. An academic year begins on the first day of the fall term and ends on the last day of the summer term.

CCP&#x27;s endowment had a market value of approximately $11.9 million in the fiscal year that ended in 2019.

==Academics and programs==
CCP has an open admissions policy and accepts life experience as credits. The college partners with local high schools to offer alternative education programs, college application support and college credit courses to high school students. In addition to its associate and certificate degree programs, CCP offers non-credit enrichment, job training and certification courses through its Continuing Professional Education and Career Training program.

CCP has dual admissions, core-to-core and program-to-program transfer agreements with more than 30 four-year institutions in Pennsylvania. The agreements allow students to automatically transfer after completing an associate degree at CCP.

CCP&#x27;s I Am More program supports formerly incarcerated students with their completion of a CCP certificate or degree program.

The Office of Collegiate Recovery supports students with their completion of a CCP certificate or degree program through recovery services.

CCP is a KEYS (Keystone Education Yields Success) program participant. The government-funded program helps students who are Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and/or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients achieve their career and economic goals.

==Student life==

===Student body===
As of fall 2020, CCP&#x27;s student body consists of 13,672 students. There are 31 percent full time and 69 percent part time students.
===Organizations===
More than 30 student clubs and organizations operate at CCP, including student government, special interest and service organizations. Student clubs are required to register and reactivate each year.

Cultural groups on campus include: African Culture and Traditions Club, Asian American Association, Christian Women Alliance, Gay Straight Alliance, Gospel Choir, Haitian Student Organization (Club Creole), International Student Organization, LASO (Latin American Student Organization), Muslim Student Association, Muslim Women League and Ritmo Latino Club.

===Publications===
&quot;The Vanguard&quot;, CCP&#x27;s independent, award-winning, student-run newspaper, circulates print and digital editions, which are available via its website and social media platforms.

===Athletics===
The CCP athletic teams, formerly known as the Colonials, are collectively known as the Lions. 
The transition was caused by a Main Campus student petition in 2016, which led to a collegewide vote to choose a new mascot. According to an article by &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, CCP&#x27;s mascot needed to reflect “inclusion, diversity, and strength,” and in 2019, Roary the lion officially became CCP&#x27;s new mascot.

The CCP athletic association chairs seven varsity athletic programs, which are open to full time students. The Lions belong to the Eastern Pennsylvania Athletic Conference (EPAC) and Region 19 of the NJCAA. Men&#x27;s sports include: basketball, cross country and track &amp; field. Women&#x27;s sports include: basketball, cross country, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The Lions became nationally affiliated with the NJCAA in summer 2013. Previously, they were members of the former Eastern Pennsylvania Collegiate Conference (EPCC) and Pennsylvania Collegiate Athletic Association (PCAA).

CCP&#x27;s teams have won four EPAC championships in men’s basketball (2015, 2016, 2018 and 2020) and two in women&#x27;s basketball (2019 and 2020).

<doc id="438178" wikidata="Q22691" url="?curid=438178" title="Ribes">
<text>Ribes () is a genus of about 200 known species of flowering plants, most of them native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The species may be known as various kinds of currants, such as redcurrants, blackcurrants, and whitecurrants, or as gooseberries, and some are cultivated for their edible fruit or as ornamental plants. &quot;Ribes&quot; is the only genus in the family Grossulariaceae.

==Description==
&quot;Ribes&quot; species are medium shrub-like plants with marked diversity in flowers and fruit. They have either palmately lobed or compound leaves, and some have thorns. The sepals of the flowers are larger than the petals, and fuse into a tube of saucer shape. The ovary is inferior, maturing into a berry with many seeds.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ribes&quot; is the single genus in the Saxifragales family Grossulariaceae. Although once included in the broader circumscription of Saxifragaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, it is now positioned as a sister group to Saxifragaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;.

===Subdivision===
First treated on a worldwide basis in 1907, the infrageneric classification has undergone many revisions, and even in the era of molecular phylogenetics there has been contradictory evidence. Although sometimes treated as two separate genera, &quot;Ribes&quot; and &quot;Grossularia&quot; (Berger 1924), the consensus has been to consider it as a single genus, divided into a number of subgenera, the main ones of which are subgenus &quot;Ribes&quot; (currants) and subgenus &quot;Grossularia&quot; (gooseberries), further subdivided into sections. Janczewski (1907) considered six subgenera and eleven sections. Berger&#x27;s twelve subgenera based on two distinct genera (see Table 1) have subsequently been demoted to sections. Weigend (2007) elevated a number of sections to produce a taxonomy of seven subgenera; &quot;Ribes&quot; (sections &quot;Ribes&quot;, &quot;Heretiera&quot;, &quot;Berisia&quot;) &quot;Coreosma&quot;, &quot;Calobotrya&quot; (sections &quot;Calobotrya&quot;, &quot;Cerophyllum&quot;), &quot;Symphocalyx&quot;, &quot;Grossularioides&quot;, &quot;Grossularia&quot;, &quot;Parilla&quot;.

Taxonomy, according to Berger, modified by Sinnott (1985):
* Subgenus &quot;Ribes&quot; (currants) 8 sections
** Section &quot;Berisia&quot; (alpine currants)
** Section &quot;Calobotrya&quot; (ornamental currants)
** Section &quot;Coreosma&quot; (black currants)
** Section &quot;Grossularioides&quot; (spiny or Gooseberry-stemmed currants)
** Section &quot;Heritiera&quot; (dwarf or skunk currants)
** Section &quot;Parilla&quot; (Andine or South American currants)
** Section &quot;Ribes&quot; (red currants)
** Section &quot;Symphocalyx&quot; (golden currants)
* Subgenus &quot;Grossularia&quot; (Gooseberries) 4 sections
** Section &quot;Grossularia&quot;
** Section &quot;Robsonia&quot; 
** Section &quot;Hesperia&quot; 
** Section &quot;Lobbia&quot; 

Some authors continued to treat &quot;Hesperia&quot; and &quot;Lobbia&quot; as subgenera. Early molecular studies suggested that subgenus &quot;Grossularia&quot; was actually embedded within subgenus &quot;Ribes&quot;. Analysis of combined molecular datasets confirms subgenus &quot;Grossularia&quot; as a monophyletic group, with two main lineages, sect. &quot;Grossularia&quot; and another clade consisting of glabrous gooseberies, including &quot;Hesperia&quot;, &quot;Lobbia&quot; and &quot;Robsonia&quot;. Other monophyletic groups identified were &quot;Calobotrya&quot;, &quot;Parilla&quot;, &quot;Symphocalyx&quot; and &quot;Berisia&quot;. However, sections &quot;Ribes&quot;, &quot;Coreosma&quot; and &quot;Heritiera&quot; were not well supported. Consequently, there is insufficient resolution to justify further taxonomic revision.

===Species===


There are around 200 species of &quot;Ribes&quot;. Selected species include:
*&quot;Ribes alpinum&quot;
*&quot;Ribes aureum&quot;
*&quot;Ribes cereum&quot;
*&quot;Ribes divaricatum&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Ribes&quot; is widely distributed through the Northern Hemisphere, and also extending south in the mountainous areas of South America. Species can be found in meadows or near streams.

==Ecology==
Currants are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species.

==Cultivation==
The genus &quot;Ribes&quot; includes the edible currants: blackcurrant, redcurrant, and white currant, as well as the European gooseberry, &quot;Ribes uva-crispa,&quot; and several hybrid varieties. It should not be confused with the dried currants used in cakes and puddings, which are from the Zante currant, a small-fruited cultivar of the grape &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. &quot;Ribes&quot; gives its name to the popular blackcurrant cordial Ribena.

The genus also includes the group of ornamental plants collectively known as the flowering currants, for instance, &quot;R. sanguineum&quot;.

=== United States ===
There are restrictions on growing some &quot;Ribes&quot; species in some U.S. states, as they are the main alternate host for white pine blister rust.

==Uses==
A number of species produce edible berries, some of which are categorized as currants and gooseberries.

Blackfoot people used blackcurrant root (&quot;Ribes hudsonianum&quot;) for the treatment of kidney diseases and menstrual and menopausal problems. The Cree used the fruit of &quot;Ribes glandulosum&quot; as a fertility enhancer to assist women in becoming pregnant.

European immigrants who settled in North America in the 18th century typically made wine from both red and white currants.

<text>John Stafford Smith (bapt. 30 March 175021 September 1836) was an English composer, church organist, and early musicologist. He was one of the first serious collectors of manuscripts of works by Johann Sebastian Bach and a friend of his son Johann Christian Bach.

Smith is best known for writing the music for &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;, which became the tune for the American patriotic song &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; following the War of 1812, and in 1931 was adopted as the national anthem of the United States.

==Early life and education==
Smith was baptised in Gloucester Cathedral, England, on 30 March 1750, the son of Martin Smith, organist of Gloucester Cathedral from 1743 to 1782. He attended the Gloucester cathedral school, where he became a boy-singer. He furthered his career as a choir boy at the Chapel Royal, London, and also studied under Dr. William Boyce.

==Career==
By the 1770s he had gained a reputation as a composer and an organist. He was elected as a member of the select Anacreontic Society which boasted amongst its membership Samuel Johnson, James Boswell and Sir Joshua Reynolds.

In the 1770s, Smith composed music for the society&#x27;s constitutional song entitled &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot; (The Anacreontic Song). The words were by Ralph Tomlinson, the president of the society, and were inspired by the 6th-century BC Greek lyric poet, Anacreon, who wrote odes on the pleasures of love and wine. The song became popular in Britain and also America following the establishment of several Anacreontic Societies there. Smith never married.

Smith later became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1784, organist for the Chapel Royal in 1802 and Master of the Children in 1805. He also became lay-vicar of Westminster Abbey. He was organist at the Three Choirs Festival held at Gloucester in 1790. He met and worked with Joseph Haydn during the famous composers London visit. 

Smith is considered to be the first Englishman to be a serious antiquarian and musicologist. He began by publishing &quot;A Collection of English Song&quot; in 1779, which musicologist Nicholas Temperley called &quot;perhaps the first scholarly edition printed in England.&quot; Smith&#x27;s library included the &quot;Old Hall Manuscript&quot;, Drexel 4175, as well as a copy of &quot;Ulm Gesangbuch&quot; from 1538 that had belonged to Johann Sebastian Bach. He also collected works that dated back to the 12th century including some Gregorian chants. His publication &quot;Musica Antiqua&quot; (1812) included musical scores of works by Jacob Obrecht, Adrian Willaert, Jacob Clemens and Cristóbal de Morales with historical notes on each piece. According to Vincent Duckles, Smith&#x27;s major contribution was &quot;to direct the attention of his readers to the importance of source studies.&quot;

==Death==

Smith died in 1836 at the age of eighty-six. He was buried at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea, and has a memorial plaque in Gloucester Cathedral, above which are displayed the US and UK&#x27;s flags.

It is often said that Smith&#x27;s death was caused by a grape-pip lodged in his windpipe. According to Pliny the Elder the ancient Greek lyric poet Anacreon, after whom the Anacreontic Society is named (and hence Smith&#x27;s most famous piece), died when he was choked by a grape-stone.

==Legacy==
===National anthem of the United States===
In 1814, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot; (later re-titled, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;) which was later set to the tune of &quot;Anacreon&quot;, a piece composed by Smith. The US Congress officially designated this song as the US national anthem in 1931.

<text>Barq&#x27;s () is a brand of root beer created by Edward Barq and bottled since the beginning of the 20th century. It is owned by the Coca-Cola Company. It was known as &quot;Barq&#x27;s Famous Olde Tyme Root Beer&quot; until 2012. Some of its formulations contain caffeine.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.overcaffeinated.org/database/soda-pop/barqs-root-beer.php&quot;&gt;Caffeine Database | Caffeine and Ingredients in Barqs Rootbeer, OverCaffeinated.org&#x27;s Report on the Ingredients in Barq&#x27;s Rootbeer&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Barq&#x27;s Brothers Bottling Company was founded in 1890 in the French Quarter of New Orleans, by Edward Charles Edmond Barq and his older brother, Gaston. The brothers bottled carbonated water and various soft drinks of their own creation. Early on, their most popular creation was an orange-flavored soda called Orangine.

Edward Barq moved to Biloxi, Mississippi in 1897 with his new wife. The following year he opened the Biloxi Artesian Bottling Works. By some accounts he debuted what was later to be known as &quot;Barq&#x27;s root beer&quot; the following year, but others maintain it was not produced until 1900.

For many decades, Barq&#x27;s was not marketed as a &quot;root beer&quot;. This was in part a desire to avoid legal conflict with the Hires Root Beer company, which was attempting to claim a trademark on the term &quot;root beer&quot;. It was also due to some differences from other root beers at the time. The formulation was sarsaparilla-based, contained less sugar, had a higher carbonation, and less of a foamy head than other brands.

The traditional slogan was the simple affirmation which first appeared on the classic diamond-necked bottle patented in 1935 by Ed Barq: &quot;Drink Barq&#x27;s. It&#x27;s good.&quot;

In 1976, the Biloxi Barq&#x27;s Company was purchased from the third generation of Barq family members by John Oudt and John Koerner. An aggressive television campaign was developed based on the &quot;Barq&#x27;s Got Sparks&quot; theme. Their plans to market the brand nationally were complicated by the existence of the Louisiana-based Barq&#x27;s companies which were owned and operated by Robinson&#x27;s heirs.

There were extended legal conflicts over the rights and ownership of the trademarks for Barq&#x27;s, Barq&#x27;s Sr. and Barq&#x27;s Root Beer. The legal battle went all the way to the United States Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, which ruled in favor of the Robinson heirs. The last family-held Louisiana Barq&#x27;s was sold by Robinson&#x27;s heirs to Coca-Cola in 2000.

The world&#x27;s largest root beer float was created in 1990, when Barq&#x27;s Root Beer cooperated with a Pick N Save grocery store in Dekalb, Illinois by mixing of Barq’s root beer with of vanilla ice cream in an above-ground swimming pool.

In the early 1990s, Barq&#x27;s sought to use current events in their marketing. In 1991, they attached coupons to 3-D glasses distributed at screenings of &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;. In 1992, Barq&#x27;s utilized the fall of the Soviet Union in a marketing campaign. The company spent between approximately $2.5 to $3 million promoting a &quot;Soviet Union Going Out of Business Sale,&quot; where customers could exchange proof of purchase items for memorabilia. In 1994, they utilized publicity surrounding the murder trial of O. J. Simpson to run a sweepstakes where customers could &quot;match the DNA&quot; from a scratchcard to win a trip to Ixtapa and &quot;Get Out of the Country.&quot; Since 1995, Barq&#x27;s has marketed with the slogan &quot;Barq&#x27;s has bite!&quot; Television ads would typically feature a Barq&#x27;s salesman (played by Nick Swardson) going door-to-door to tell people, &quot;Barq&#x27;s has bite&quot; at which point the subjects would take a sip and have an energetic reaction.

Regular Barq&#x27;s has 22.5 mg of caffeine per 12 ounce serving (similar to green tea), while Diet Barq&#x27;s has no caffeine. Barq&#x27;s also contains sodium benzoate as a flavor protectant, which under the right conditions, is a precursor to the known carcinogen benzene. It was still used as of 2008.

The Barq&#x27;s that is dispensed from Coca-Cola Freestyle machines is caffeine-free. This is because the system uses the same concentrated, microdosed ingredient for both Barq&#x27;s and Diet Barq&#x27;s; the only difference between the two is the sweetener that is added. It is also common for Barq&#x27;s that is sold in the state of Utah to be caffeine-free because many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints avoid caffeinated beverages.

<text>The &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class was a class of eight pre-dreadnought battleships launched by the Royal Navy between 1903 and 1905. The class comprised , the lead ship, , , , , , , and . They marked the first major development of the basic pre-dreadnought type that had been developed with the type of the mid-1890s, all of which had been designed by the Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, with the primary innovation being the adoption of a heavy secondary battery of four guns to supplement the standard main battery of four guns. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s were among the last pre-dreadnoughts built for the Royal Navy before the construction and launch of the revolutionary battleship HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; in 1906, which immediately rendered them obsolescent.

The ships served with the Atlantic Fleet from 1905 to 1907, when they were transferred to the Channel Fleet, though this service lasted only until 1908–1909, when they were reassigned to the Home Fleet. During this period, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; served as fleet flagship as a result of a request from her namesake that she always serve as such. In 1911, &quot;New Zealand&quot; was renamed &quot;Zealandia&quot;. &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot; were involved with experiments with seaplanes in 1912, and that year all members of the class were assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet and were later sent to the Mediterranean Sea to respond to the First Balkan War.

By the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s were sent to the Grand Fleet to support the Northern Patrol and to conduct sweeps in the North Sea for German warships, though they never saw combat. In January 1916, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; struck a German naval mine and sank, though her crew was safely evacuated. By mid-1916, the surviving ships were no longer suitable for front-line fleet service, and so they were dispersed to other tasks, including coastal defence with the Nore Command and for operations in the Gallipoli Campaign. &quot;Africa&quot; was sent to the Atlantic Patrol in 1917 and was later stricken with Spanish flu, and &quot;Britannia&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat two days before the end of the war, one of the last British warships to be sunk in the conflict. The surviving members of the class were all sold for scrap in the early 1920s.

==Design==

Design work on what would become the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class began in 1901; the Royal Navy had observed that foreign battleships, such as the Italian and the American , had begun to carry a heavy secondary battery of guns. The design staff, operating without the direction of the Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, who was ill at the time, began a series of studies for a battleship based on the preceding armed with a secondary battery of or guns. The Assistant DNC, J. H. Narbeth, initially had a great deal of trouble arranging the guns such that the secondary turrets did not interfere with the main battery guns. After examining the directly superimposed turrets used in the &quot;Virginia&quot;s, Narbeth concluded that it was not a workable solution, and so adopted an arrangement with four secondary turrets, one at each corner of the superstructure.

The Admiralty provisionally accepted a draft equipped with eight 7.5 in guns in twin gun turrets, but after White returned, he suggested the 9.2 in guns would be more effective against heavily armoured ships, and so the decision was made to switch to that armament. The heavy secondary guns added a great deal of weight high in the ship and they took up space on the deck, thus forcing the designers to make compromises to other aspects of the vessels, particularly the rest of the secondary battery. These guns, traditionally carried in casemates, were relocated to a central box battery, since it would require less armour to protect the guns in such a compact arrangement. They were also mounted lower relative to the waterline, owing to the decreased freeboard; this rendered the guns essentially unusable in anything but relatively calm seas. Combined with a higher metacentric height, the low freeboard of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s made them prone to shipping water in heavy seas and excessive rolling.

Despite the problems with their secondary armament, the ships were significantly more powerful than earlier British battleships and they compared well with foreign contemporaries. They nevertheless suffered the same fate as all late pre-dreadnought battleships. Completed shortly before the advent of the all-big-gun in 1906, they were quickly rendered obsolescent, such that during the First World War, the &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships were frequently deployed at the front of the dreadnought battle squadrons to screen them for naval mines, either by sighting or striking them before the dreadnoughts entered the area.

The &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class was the culmination of battleship design under the direction of White that had begun with the in the late 1880s. The follow-on class, the two s, were a major departure from previous designs and marked a transitional stage between pre-dreadnought and dreadnought-type battleships.

===General characteristics===
The ships of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships were more than a thousand tons heavier than earlier battleships displacing normally and up to fully loaded. The ships had of freeboard forward, amidships, and aft. To save weight, the ships had their storage for food and other supplies reduced from a 4-month supply that was standard in previous designs to 3 months. Their crew varied over the course of their careers, ranging from 755 to 815; for example, after entering service, had a crew of 777 officers and ratings; crews tended to increase during wartime.

&quot;King Edward VII&quot; and her sister ships discarded the aft conning tower that was standard practice in favour of a torpedo control tower that directed the firing of the stern torpedo tubes. The ships were fitted with two heavy pole masts; their foremasts were equipped with tops used to mount wireless telegraphy and fire control equipment. , , &quot;Dominion&quot;, , and carried large, oval tops for most of their equipment and a smaller top below, while , , and had smaller, square tops, with two small tops lower on the masts.

The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s were the first British battleships with balanced rudders since the 1870s and were very manoeuvrable, with a tactical diameter of at . However, they were difficult to keep on a straight course, and this characteristic led to them being nicknamed &quot;the Wobbly Eight&quot; during their 1914–1916 service in the Grand Fleet. They had a slightly faster roll than previous British battleship classes, but were good gun platforms, although very wet in bad weather.

===Machinery===
The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two inward-turning screws, with steam provided by water-tube or fire-tube boilers of various types. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; had ten Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers and six Scotch marine boilers, while &quot;Africa&quot;, &quot;Britannia&quot;, &quot;Hindustan&quot;, and &quot;Hibernia&quot; received eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers and three cylindrical return tube boilers. &quot;New Zealand&quot; used eighteen Niclausse boilers and three of the cylindrical return tube boilers, and &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;Commonwealth&quot; had sixteen of the Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers only. The reason multiple boiler arrangements were adopted was to compare the effectiveness of different boiler types. In service, the ships with mixed boiler types proved to be something of a disappointment, since the differing boiler types added complications to the powerplant and hampered efficient operation; they produced no benefit in return, and the experiments were not repeated in subsequent designs. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. Primarily powered by coal, all of the class except &quot;New Zealand&quot; had oil sprayers installed during construction, the first time this had been done in British battleships. These allowed steam pressure to be rapidly increased, improving the acceleration of the ships; this ability later led to the decision to adopt all oil-fired boilers in the super-dreadnoughts. &quot;New Zealand&quot;″s Niclausse boilers could not be adapted to use the oil sprayers.

The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from , though some of the ships exceeded on speed trials, including &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot;. Using only coal, the ships had a cruising radius of about at an economical speed of , and with the supplemental fuel oil, their range increased to .

===Armament===

The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s had four 12-inch 40-calibre Mk IX guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. The guns were carried in BVIIS-type mountings, which had a range of elevation from -5 degrees to of 13.5 degrees, and required the guns to return to 4.5 degrees to be loaded. The guns had a muzzle velocity of , and they were capable of penetrating 12 inches of Krupp armour at a range of . At their maximum elevation, the guns had a range of . &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and &quot;Zealandia&quot; later had their mounts modified to allow elevation to 30 degrees, which extended their maximum range significantly, to . These were supported by a heavy secondary battery of four guns in four single turrets, two on each broadside. The guns were carried in Mk VS mounts, which had a range of elevation from -7 to +15 degrees, allowing for a maximum range of . Muzzle velocity was .

The first five ships also mounted ten Mark VII 45-calibre guns, the same battery carried by earlier British battleships, though unlike earlier battleships, the &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s mounted these guns in a central battery rather than in casemates. The guns had a muzzle velocity of , and they could penetrate six inches of Krupp armour at . Maximum elevation was 14 degrees, which allowed the guns to engage targets out to . The last three ships (&quot;Britannia&quot;, &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot;) were instead fitted with 6-inch 50 calibre guns, which had been ordered for the &quot;Warrior&quot;-class armoured cruisers, but were surplus when it was decided to complete the &quot;Warrior&quot;s with a secondary armament of guns. For defence against torpedo boats, they carried fourteen 12-pounder guns and fourteen 3-pounder guns that were dispersed in pivot mounts around the ship. As was customary for battleships of the period, they were also equipped with five torpedo tubes submerged in the hull; two were on each broadside, with the fifth in the stern.

===Armour===
Most of the heavy armour of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class consisted of Krupp cemented armour; this included most of the belt armour, main and secondary turrets and their barbettes, and the conning tower. The armour layout of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class was very similar to the protection scheme used in the and &quot;London&quot; classes, with the primary change being the adoption of the armoured box for the 6-inch guns, rather than individual, armoured casemates. They had an armoured belt that was thick in the main portion of the belt; the transverse bulkhead on the aft end of the belt was thick. Aft of the transverse bulkhead, the side of the ship was protected with of Krupp non-cemented plate. Forward of the fore barbette, the belt was reduced to , then tapered to , then to at the extreme end of the bow. The upper edge of the main belt was reduced to thick, and above that was the battery deck for the 6-inch guns, which was protected with 7-inch-thick plate. The guns in the battery were divided with Krupp non-cemented screens.

The armoured deck was 2 in of mild steel, apart from the central portion of the hull, where it was reduced to and raised a deck level to the roof of the central battery. The reduction in thickness there was necessary to reduce topweight. The ships&#x27; main battery turrets had sides that were 8 to 12 inches thick, mounted atop 12-inch-thick barbettes. The 9.2-inch guns received thinner armour protection, with 5- to 9-inch sides; their barbettes were only thick, and they were reduced in height on the assumption that the side armour provided sufficient protection, and the likelihood of a shell exploding below the barbette in the ammunition hoists was very small. The conning tower had 12-inch sides.

===Modifications===
The ships of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class underwent a series of modifications over the courses of their careers. In 1907, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; had some of her 12-pounder guns temporarily relocated to the main battery turret roofs, but this was found to be unsatisfactory and they reverted to their original locations that same year. Between 1907 and 1908, she and &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, &quot;Dominion&quot;, &quot;Hindustan&quot;, and &quot;New Zealand&quot; had their bridge-mounted 3-pounders removed. They also received search lights in various positions, including the 9.2-inch turret roofs and the bridge wings. Funnel identification bands were added to all eight ships as well. &quot;Hibernia&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot; received rangefinders on their aft superstructure in 1911–1912, and most of the ships had further alterations to their search lights. &quot;Africa&quot; had experimental aircraft launching ramps installed on her bow in 1912 for flight tests, though the equipment was later transferred to &quot;Hibernia&quot; that year, from which it was removed altogether.

After the start of the First World War in August 1914, &quot;Zealandia&quot; (ex-&quot;New Zealand&quot;) gave one of her 12-pounders to arm a Q-ship, receiving a pair of 3-pounders in its place. During a refit in that period, &quot;Dominion&quot;″s bridge was enlarged. The 6-inch battery was removed from all of the ships of the class between 1916 and April 1917, with each ship having four of the guns re-mounted a deck higher in open pivot mounts in place of the 12-pounder guns that had been located there, where they were less affected by heavy seas, and thus, were more usable weapons. Additional search lights were installed during this period as well.

In 1918, &quot;Zealandia&quot; and &quot;Commonwealth&quot; were heavily modernised for use as gunnery training ships. Their pole masts were replaced with heavy tripod masts that were capable of supporting the latest fire control directors and rangefinders. Their remaining 12-pounder guns were removed and a pair of anti-aircraft guns were added on the aft superstructure. &quot;Commonwealth&quot; received anti-torpedo bulges, though &quot;Zealandia&quot; did not. &quot;Commonwealth&quot; received dazzle camouflage, and it has been reported that &quot;Zealandia&quot; was similarly painted, but according to the naval historian R. A. Burt, the &quot;lack of official and photographic evidence rules this out.&quot;

==Ships==
&quot;King Edward VII&quot;, the first battleship laid down after the beginning of Edward VII&#x27;s reign, was named for the monarch; the rest of the members of the class were named for the constituent parts of the British Empire, including the Commonwealth of Australia, Dominion of Canada, Hindustan (India), Britannia (the Roman name for Great Britain), New Zealand, the Empire&#x27;s African colonies, and Hibernia (the Roman name for Ireland).
==Service history==
As the members of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; class entered service beginning in 1905, they joined the Atlantic Fleet, where &quot;King Edward VII&quot; served as the fleet flagship, per her namesake&#x27;s request that the ship always be used as a flagship. In 1907, the members of the class were transferred to the Channel Fleet, with &quot;King Edward VII&quot; again the fleet flagship. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot; were transferred to the Home Fleet in 1908, and the rest of the class followed them there the next year. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was renamed &quot;Zealandia&quot; in 1911 to allow her original name to be used for the battlecruiser . Beginning in 1912, the ships were reorganised as the 3rd Battle Squadron, a component of the Home Fleet.

In mid-1912, &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot; were involved in tests with the Short Improved S.27 biplane &quot;S.38&quot; flown by Commander Charles Samson; the former was the first British warship to launch an aircraft, and the latter was the first to do so whilst underway. The tests demonstrated the utility of aircraft used to spot the fall of shot and to scout for hostile vessels, but also revealed the impracticability of the equipment available at the time. During the First Balkan War of 1912–1913, the ships of the 3rd Battle Squadron were sent to the Mediterranean Sea to represent British interests in the region; they were involved in an international blockade of Montenegro to protest the Montenegrin occupation of Scutari, which was to be part of the newly created state of Albania. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;s returned to British waters in 1913, where they passed the next year uneventfully.

After Britain entered the First World War on 5 August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet, the main British fleet during the war. The ships were temporarily detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet in November before returning to the Grand Fleet at the end of the month. While serving with the Grand Fleet, the squadron was tasked with conducting operations around Scotland and the North Sea as part of the Northern Patrol. The 3rd Battle Squadron was also involved in patrols of the entire Grand Fleet central North Sea through mid-1915, including in response to the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 and to support the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron during the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915. The 3rd Battle Squadron did not see action against German forces during this period, however. In January 1916, while steaming to Ireland for a refit, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; struck a mine that had been laid by the German auxiliary cruiser ; the battleship sank slowly enough that her entire crew was taken off, with the exception of one man who fell to his death during the evacuation.
In 1916, the squadron was detached to the Nore Command to guard the British southern coast, and some ships were assigned to other operations elsewhere. &quot;Hibernia&quot; and &quot;Zealandia&quot; were sent to the eastern Mediterranean in late 1915 to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign, though they saw little activity there apart from during the evacuation of Allied forces from the peninsula in early 1916. &quot;Zealandia&quot; returned to the 3rd Battle Squadron after the end of the Gallipoli Campaign. That year, &quot;Britannia&quot; was sent to the Adriatic Sea to reinforce the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) against the Austro-Hungarian Navy, though she saw no action there. &quot;Africa&quot; was attached to the 9th Cruiser Squadron for service in the Atlantic Patrol in 1917, tasked with escorting convoys between Sierra Leone and Cape Town, South Africa. &quot;Africa&quot;″s crew was stricken with Spanish flu while she was in Sierra Leone in 1918, with some 476 men reported ill and 52 deaths.

That year, &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and &quot;Zealandia&quot; were heavily modernised, with the former being used briefly on the Northern Patrol in 1918 before serving as a gunnery training ship. &quot;Zealandia&quot; was never actually used as a training ship, but she was involved in fire control experiments and was later used as a barracks ship. &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot; served as depot ships to support the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. &quot;Britannia&quot; was torpedoed by the German U-boat off Cape Trafalgar on 9 November, just two days before the Armistice with Germany that ended the fighting; she was one of the last British warships to be lost during the war. The torpedo started a serious fire in one of her 9.2-inch magazines, but like &quot;King Edward VII&quot;, she remained afloat long enough for her crew to be taken off, though some fifty men were killed in the torpedoing and subsequent fire. The six surviving members of the class were sold to ship breakers between 1920 and 1923 and were subsequently broken up for scrap.

<doc id="438261" wikidata="Q147498" url="?curid=438261" title="Ulmus glabra">
<text>Ulmus glabra, the wych elm or Scots elm, has the widest range of the European elm species, from Ireland eastwards to the Ural Mountains, and from the Arctic Circle south to the mountains of the Peloponnese and Sicily, where the species reaches its southern limit in Europe; it is also found in Iran. A large deciduous tree, it is essentially a montane species, growing at elevations up to , preferring sites with moist soils and high humidity. The tree can form pure forests in Scandinavia and occurs as far north as latitude 67°N at Beiarn Municipality in Norway. It has been successfully introduced as far north as Tromsø and Alta in northern Norway (70°N). It has also been successfully introduced to Narsarsuaq, near the southern tip of Greenland (61°N).

The tree was by far the most common elm in the north and west of the British Isles and is now acknowledged as the only indisputably British native elm species. Owing to its former abundance in Scotland, the tree is occasionally known as the Scotch or Scots elm; Loch Lomond is said to be a corruption of the Gaelic &quot;Lac Leaman&quot; interpreted by some as &#x27;Lake of the Elms&#x27;, &#x27;leaman&#x27; being the plural form of leam or lem, &#x27;elm&#x27;.

Closely related species, such as Bergmann&#x27;s elm &quot;U. bergmanniana&quot; and Manchurian elm &quot;U. laciniata&quot;, native to northeast Asia, were once sometimes included in &quot;U. glabra&quot;; another close relative is the Himalayan or Kashmir elm &quot;U. wallichiana&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Ulmus elliptica&quot; from the Caucasus, considered a species by some authorities, is often listed as a regional form of &quot;Ulmus glabra&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;wych&quot; (also spelled &quot;witch&quot;) comes from the Old English , meaning pliant or supple, which also gives definition to wicker and weak. Jacob George Strutt&#x27;s 1822 book, &quot;Sylva Britannica&quot; attests that the Wych Elm was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Wych Hazel&quot;, a name now applied to the unrelated species Hamamelis, commonly called &quot;wych hazels&quot;.

==Classification==

===Subspecies===
Some botanists, notably Lindquist (1931), have proposed two subspecies:
* &quot;U. glabra&quot; subsp. &quot;glabra&quot; in the south of the species&#x27; range: broad leaves with short tapering base and acute lobes; trees often with a short, forked trunk and a low, broad crown;
* &quot;U. glabra&quot; subsp. &quot;montana&quot; in the north of the species&#x27; range (northern Britain, Scandinavia): leaves narrower, with a long tapering base and without acute lobes; trees commonly with a long single trunk and a tall, narrow crown.

Much overlap is seen between populations with these characters, and the distinction may owe to environmental influence, rather than genetic variation; the subspecies are not accepted by &quot;Flora Europaea&quot;.
==Description==
The type sometimes reaches heights of , typically with a broad crown where open-grown, supported by a short bole up to diameter at breast height (DBH). Normally, root suckers are not seen; natural reproduction is by seed alone. The tree is notable for its very tough, supple young shoots, which are always without the corky ridges or &#x27;wings&#x27; characteristic of many elms. The alternate leaves are deciduous, 6–17 cm long by 3–12 cm broad, usually obovate with an asymmetric base, the lobe often completely covering the short (&lt;5 mm) petiole; the upper surface is rough. Leaves on juvenile or shade-grown shoots sometimes have three or more lobes near the apex. The perfect hermaphrodite flowers appear before the leaves in early spring, produced in clusters of 10–20; they are 4 mm across on 10 mm long stems, and being wind-pollinated, are apetalous. The fruit is a winged samara 20 mm long and 15 mm broad, with a single, round, 6 mm seed in the centre, maturing in late spring.
==Pests and diseases==
While the species is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease, it is less favoured as a host by the elm bark beetles, which act as vectors. Research in Spain has indicated the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, rendering the tree bark less attractive to the beetle than the field elm, though at 87 μg/g dried bark, its concentration is not as effective as in &quot;Ulmus laevis&quot; (200 μg/g). Moreover, once the tree is dying, its bark is quickly colonized by the fungus &quot;Phoma&quot;, which radically reduces the amount of bark available for the beetle to breed on. In European trials, clones of apparently resistant trees were inoculated with the pathogen, causing 85 – 100% wilting, resulting in 68% mortality by the following year. DNA analysis by Cemagref (now Irstea) in France has determined the genetic diversity within the species is very limited, making the chances of a resistant tree evolving rather remote.

A 300-year-old example growing in Grenzhammer, Ilmenau has allegedly been scientifically proven to be resistant to Dutch elm disease.

The Swedish Forest Tree Breeding Association at Källstorp produced triploid and tetraploid forms of the tree, but these proved no more resistant to Dutch elm disease than the normal diploid form.

In trials conducted in Italy, the tree was found to have a slight to moderate susceptibility to elm yellows, and a high susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle &quot;Xanthogaleruca luteola&quot;.
==Cultivation==
The wych elm is moderately shade-tolerant, but requires deep, rich soils as typically found along river valleys. The species is intolerant of acid soils and flooding, as it is of prolonged drought. Although rarely used as a street tree owing to its shape, it can be surprisingly tolerant of urban air pollution, constricted growing conditions, and severe pollarding.

As wych elm does not sucker from the roots, and any seedlings are often consumed by uncontrolled deer populations, regeneration is very restricted, limited to sprouts from the stumps of young trees. The resultant decline has been extreme, and the wych elm is now uncommon over much of its former range. It is best propagated from seed or by layering stooled stock plants, although softwood cuttings taken in early June will root fairly reliably under mist.

Wych elm was widely planted in Edinburgh in the 19th century as a park and avenue tree, and despite losses, it remains abundant there, regenerating through seedlings. It was introduced to New England in the 18th century, to Canada (as &quot;U. montana&quot; at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa) and Australia in the 19th century.
==Uses==

===Lumber===
Wych elm wood is prized by craftsmen for its colouring, its striking grain, its &#x27;partridge-breast&#x27; or &#x27;catspaw&#x27; markings, and when worked, its occasional iridescent greenish sheen or &#x27;bloom&#x27;. The bosses on old trees produce the characteristic fissures and markings of &#x27;burr elm&#x27; wood. Bosses fringed with shoots are burrs, whereas unfringed bosses are burls. 
===Medicine===

In 18th century France, the inner bark of &quot;Ulmus glabra&quot;, &quot;orme pyramidale&quot;, had a brief reputation as a panacea;
&quot;it was taken as a powder, as an extract, as an elixir, even in baths. It was good for the nerves, the chest, the stomach — what can I say? — it was a true panacea.&quot; It was this so-called &quot;pyramidal elm bark&quot; about which Michel-Philippe Bouvart famously quipped &quot;Take it, Madame... and hurry up while it [still] cures.&quot; It still appeared in a pharmacopeia of 1893.

==Notable trees==

Possibly the oldest wych elm in Europe grew at Beauly Priory in Inverness-shire, Scotland; the tree succumbed to DED in 2022 and collapsed the following year. The priory was founded circa 1230, the tree already in existence.

The UK Champion listed in the Tree Register of the British Isles was at Brahan in the Scottish Highlands (died 2021); it had a girth of 703 cm (2.23 m DBH) and a height of 24 m. Possibly the oldest specimen in England was found in 2018 in a field north of Hopton Castle in Shropshire. Coppiced long ago, its bole girth measured 6.3 m in 2018. The oldest specimen in Edinburgh is believed to be the tree (girth 5.2 m) in the former grounds of Duddingston House, now Duddingston Golf Course. Other notable specimens in Edinburgh are to be found in Learmonth Gardens and The Meadows.

In Europe, a large tree planted in 1620 grows at Bergemolo, 5 km south of Demonte in Piedmont, Italy (bole-girth 6.2 m, 2.0 m DBH, height 26 m., 2008). Other ancient specimens grow at Styria, in Austria, and at Grenzhammer, Germany (see Gallery). In 1998, over 700 healthy, mature trees were discovered on the upper slopes of Mount Šimonka in Slovakia, but they are believed to have survived courtesy of their isolation from disease-carrying beetles rather than any innate resistance; 50 clones of these trees were presented to the Prince of Wales for planting at his Highgrove Estate, and at Clapham, Yorkshire.

===In literature===
E. M. Forster cites a particular wych elm, one that grew at his childhood home of Rooks Nest, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, 16 times in his novel &quot;Howards End&quot;. This tree overhangs the house of the title and is said to have a &quot;...girth that a dozen men could not have spanned...&quot; Forster describes the tree as &quot;...a comrade, bending over the house, strength and adventure in its roots.&quot; The wych elm of the novel had pigs&#x27; teeth embedded in the trunk by country people long ago and it was said that chewing some of the bark could cure toothache. In keeping with the novel&#x27;s epigraph, &quot;Only connect...&quot;, the wych elm may be seen by some as a symbol of the connection of humans to the earth. Margaret Schlegel, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, fears that any &quot;...westerly gale might blow the wych elm down and bring the end of all things...&quot; The tree is changed to a chestnut in the 1991 film adaptation of &quot;Howards End&quot;.

==Cultivars==
About 40 cultivars have been raised, although at least 30 are now probably lost to cultivation as a consequence of Dutch elm disease and/or other factors:

&#x27;Exoniensis&#x27;, Exeter Elm, has traditionally been classified as a form of &quot;U. glabra&quot;.

==Hybrids and hybrid cultivars==
&quot;U. glabra&quot; hybridises naturally with &quot;U. minor&quot;, producing elms of the &quot;Ulmus × hollandica&quot; group, from which have arisen a number of cultivars:

However, hybrids of &quot;U. glabra&quot; and &quot;U. pumila&quot;, the Siberian elm, have not been observed in the field and only achieved in the laboratory, though the ranges of the two species, the latter introduced by man, overlap in parts of Southern Europe, notably Spain. A crossing in Russia of &quot;U. glabra&quot; and &quot;U. pumila&quot; produced the hybrid named &quot;Ulmus × arbuscula&quot;; a similar crossing was cloned (&#x27;FL025&#x27;) by the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante (IPP), Florence, as part of the Italian elm breeding programme circa 2000.

Hybrids with &quot;U. glabra&quot; in their ancestry have featured strongly in recent artificial hybridization experiments in Europe, notably at Wageningen in the Netherlands, and a number of hybrid cultivars have been commercially released since 1960. The earlier trees were raised in response to the initial Dutch elm disease pandemic that afflicted Europe after the First World War, and were to prove vulnerable to the much more virulent strain of the disease that arrived in the late 1960s. However, further research eventually produced several trees effectively immune to disease, which were released after 1989.

<text>The Ulmaceae () are a family of flowering plants that includes the elms (genus &quot;Ulmus&quot;), and the zelkovas (genus &quot;Zelkova&quot;). Members of the family are widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone, and have a scattered distribution elsewhere except for Australasia.

The family was formerly sometimes treated to include the hackberries, (&quot;Celtis&quot; and allies), but an analysis by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group suggests that these genera are better placed in the related family Cannabaceae. It generally is considered to include ca 7 genera and about 45 species. Some classifications also include the genus &quot;Ampelocera&quot;.

==Description==
The family is a group of evergreen or deciduous trees and shrubs with mucilaginous substances in leaf and bark tissue. Leaves are usually alternate on the stems. The leaf blades are simple (not compound), with entire (smooth) or variously toothed margins, and often have an asymmetrical base. The flowers are small and either bisexual or unisexual. The fruit is an indehiscent samara, nut, or drupe. 

==Uses==
&quot;Ulmus&quot; provides important timber trees mostly for furniture.

==Phylogeny==
Modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:

<text>Batman Beyond (titled Batman of the Future in European territories) is an American superhero animated television series based on the DC Comics superhero Batman. Created and developed by Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, and Alan Burnett and produced by Warner Bros. Television Animation, the series began airing on January 10, 1999 on Kids&#x27; WB, and ended on December 18, 2001 on Cartoon Network. In the United Kingdom, it began airing on September 4, 2000. After 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one direct-to-video feature film, the series was brought to an end in favor of the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series. &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; is the third series (chronologically the final series) of the DC Animated Universe, and serves as the sequel to both &quot;&quot; and &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;.

Though the initial announcement of the series were mixed, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; received critical acclaim and gained a cult following. Despite being conceived as a kid-friendly Batman series by Warner Bros. Animation, it ended up being darker than its predecessor &quot;Batman: The Animated Series.&quot;

==Plot==

The story begins in the then-distant year of 2019. Bruce Wayne, now in his 50s, continues to fight crime as Batman in a new high-tech Batsuit, although he has increased difficulty in handling criminals he could once subdue with finesse and they no longer seem to be afraid of him as he has lost his mystique. In what was supposed to be a routine mission, the rescue of a kidnapped heiress, Batman suffers a mild heart attack and at risk of being beaten to death by one of the kidnappers, is forced to use a gun to fend him off. Despite not killing the man, Bruce is ashamed that he almost broke his strict no-killing rule and, knowing his frailty and fearing that he will eventually succumb to his murderous temptation if he continues his crime-fighting, decides to retire from being Batman for good. By this point in his life, his butler Alfred Pennyworth and his family friend Leslie Thompkins have died and his close allies have all either retired or died of natural causes. His crime-fighting partners are still alive, but estranged from him following their retirements from their alter-egos and possible falling outs with him. His rogues&#x27; gallery are all either in prison, in hiding, institutionalized, reformed or deceased. He has also severed his ties with other superheroes.

The story moves ahead 20 years later in Neo-Gotham, a futuristic version of Gotham City, a megalopolis featuring staggering high rises and flying vehicles driven by upper class society. Bruce is now a man in his 70s, living in solitary isolation in Wayne Manor, with no other companion but his guard dog Ace. It is implied by his virtue of continuing to fight crime for as long as possible and ignoring his aging and deteriorating health (he had retained his former partner&#x27;s costumes) in addition to his obsessiveness that he had suffered a tragic event years prior to his retirement, which is revealed in &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;. Terry McGinnis is an athletic 16-year-old high school student and reformed juvenile delinquent with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. Living on difficult terms with his divorced father Warren McGinnis, Terry disobeys his curfew one night to meet up with his girlfriend Dana Tan, only to be harassed by a criminal gang called the Jokerz, who have seemingly modeled themselves after the original Batman&#x27;s archenemy, the Joker. A high-speed motorcycle chase between him and the Jokerz ends in the grounds of Wayne Manor, where they run into Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the gang side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce&#x27;s heart condition. Terry helps him back to the manor and, while exploring the mansion, stumbles upon the entrance to the Batcave and thus discovers Bruce&#x27;s secrets, only to be chased out by an angered Bruce.

Terry returns home to discover that his father has been murdered, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after moving in with his mother Mary and younger brother Matt, he discovers that his father had uncovered the production of illegal chemical weapons by Derek Powers, and that the man actually responsible for his father&#x27;s murder is Powers&#x27; personal assistant/bodyguard Mr. Fixx. Terry goes to Bruce who tells Terry to take the evidence to Barbara Gordon, the current Police Commissioner. After the evidence of the illegal weapon production is forcibly taken from Terry by Derek Powers, Terry takes matters into his own hands and steals the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes all of Terry&#x27;s efforts and demands that he return the suit, but Terry convinces Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle and subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. During the battle, Powers is exposed to the chemical and forced to flee into hiding to receive treatment, which subsequently mutates him into a radiation-emitting entity, though he uses artificial skin to hide the accident. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman&#x27;s presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman, with Bruce himself mentoring Terry while also serving as a surrogate father-figure to the young teen in addition to working as Bruce&#x27;s chauffeur and assistant so that Terry can support his surviving family.

The new Batman soon develops his own rogues gallery, such as Powers himself who adopts the name Blight; the seductive shapeshifter Inque; the hypnotist Spellbinder; the sound weaponizer Shriek; the deadly assassin Curaré; the insane terrorist Mad Stan; the cybernetically enhanced African big-game hunter Stalker; nerdy psychokinetic Willie Watt; and a new version of the Royal Flush Gang. Terry often also clashes with some of his mentor&#x27;s old foes, such as a rejuvenated Mr. Freeze, Bane, who has become a shell of his former self due to his overuse of venom, which is now being used as slap on patches by corrupt athletes, the longevous Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, and somewhat inevitably, the Joker himself, reborn via a microchip he inserted into the brain of Batman&#x27;s former partner, Tim Drake, many years ago.

Terry also makes allies in Neo-Gotham, including computer genius Max Gibson, who discovers Batman&#x27;s secret identity and becomes his sidekick. Police Commissioner Barbara Gordon, Bruce&#x27;s former partner Batgirl, also occasionally works with Terry. Though initially unhappy about another person following in Bruce&#x27;s dangerous footsteps and at first vehemently opposed to his efforts to help, she admits that the city needs Batman, but neither uses the Bat-Signal nor has a very close working relationship with him, unlike her father during Bruce&#x27;s time as Batman. He also has a brief relationship with Melanie Walker, who was forced to do the bidding of her family, the new Royal Flush Gang, under the codename Ten. Bruce sympathizes with Terry and tells him of his own relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Terry also later encounters Superman and a future incarnation of the Justice League (Kai-Ro/Green Lantern, Aquagirl, Warhawk and Big Barda) and helps them fight an alien threat, although he does not join the group until years later where he presumably only operates as a part-timer like his mentor.

In the far future, Terry discovers that via genetic research, he is actually Bruce&#x27;s biological son, having realized this when Bruce&#x27;s kidneys were failing and Terry&#x27;s DNA exposed him as a perfect match as a donor. While contemplating confronting Bruce, leaving Dana and abandoning the Justice League for good, Terry confronts the one responsible, Amanda Waller, an enemy-turned-ally of Bruce during his years in the League. Waller admits her participation in replacing Warren McGinnis&#x27;s DNA with Bruce&#x27;s as part of her Project Batman Beyond to ensure that Batman would have a successor, and emphasizes that Terry is not Bruce&#x27;s clone but his biological son and free to make different life choices to the ones Bruce made. Finding peace with himself, Terry reconciles with Bruce and the League, and plans to propose to Dana while continuing as Batman.

==Voice cast==

* Will Friedle as Terry McGinnis / Batman:The second Batman, he is a high school student and former delinquent. Under the pretense of doing errands for Bruce, Terry fights crime as the new Batman. Terry was chosen to be the new Dark Knight as he shared a similar loss as Bruce had, that being the death of a parent (although unlike Bruce, who lost both of his parents, Terry only lost his father).
* Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne: The original Batman, although initially reluctant he later becomes Terry&#x27;s employer, mentor, and predecessor who guides Terry through the Batcomputer but also occasionally ventures into the field to help his successor if the situation demands it, despite the risks associated with his age. During his final mission as the Dark Knight twenty years prior to the events of the main story, Bruce suffered a heart attack that nearly cost him his life, forcing him to break his primary moral principle by threatening to kill a criminal with a gun in self-defense. Horrified that he nearly used the type of weapon that took his parents&#x27; (Thomas and Martha) lives and the very thing that drove him to become a vigilante, and afraid of what he might do next, Wayne reluctantly hung up the cowl.
* Cree Summer as Maxine &quot;Max&quot; Gibson: A genius high schooler and friend of Terry&#x27;s. She discovers his secret identity, and from then on occasionally helps Batman in a role akin to that of Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s deceased former butler, though she is considered a nuisance to his predecessor (but less so as time went on). Her parents are divorced and she has an unnamed sister.
*Lauren Tom as Dana Tan: Terry&#x27;s on and off girlfriend in high school who is initially and formerly unaware of his secret identity as the new Dark Knight, and thus surprised or upset by his frequent absences which she only knows due to him working as a personal assistant for Bruce Wayne, to support his family financially following his father&#x27;s death. She also has a father who is disapproving of Terry because of the latter&#x27;s past as an irresponsible delinquent, which serves as a reminder and another motivation for Terry being Batman.
* Frank Welker as Ace:Bruce Wayne&#x27;s pet dog and his sole companion in Wayne Manor, the billionaire rescued and took in the stray Great Dane after the canine defended him from a Jokerz thug during one of Wayne&#x27;s annual visits in memory of his parents to Crime Alley. Fiercely loyal to Bruce, he eventually develops a bond with Terry as well.
* Stockard Channing (season one and two) and Angie Harmon (season 3) as Barbara Gordon: The new Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department, having succeeded her father Jim and one of Bruce&#x27;s former crime-fighting partners, Batgirl. Barbara was at one point in her younger years romantically involved with Bruce, which ended badly. Unlike her father, Barbara initially has a rocky relationship with the new Batman, being aware of his criminal record and showing resentment towards Bruce for dragging him into this life and is at first against him intervening in police duty, even threatening him with arrest. This is revealed to have been due to a long standing grudge towards Bruce for how he treated his former partners and also because of a fateful night when the Bat-family splintered. She slowly gains a grudging respect for Terry after he helps her in several sticky situations and begins acknowledging his help whenever needed, though she does not use a Bat-Signal, unlike her father. However, she still has direct access to the Batcave. She is married to Sam Young, the District Attorney of Neo-Gotham.

==Episodes==

===Crossovers===
The third season of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; featured the two-part episode &quot;The Call&quot; with (for the first time) a futuristic Justice League, a springboard for the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series. The setting and characters of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; were also briefly revived in &quot;Static Shock&quot; during the episode &quot;Future Shock&quot; in which Static is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.

&quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; revisited the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; world twice in 2005. The first was in &quot;The Once and Future Thing&quot; (Part 2), which featured Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern transported 50 years into the future to stop a time-travelling villain with the help of the future Justice League (Batman II, Static and Warhawk).

The second time was meant to be the de facto series finale for &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;: the episode &quot;Epilogue&quot; reveals that Bruce Wayne is actually Terry McGinnis&#x27;s biological father. The story, set 15 years after &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, centers on Terry (now in his early 30s) tracking down an elderly Amanda Waller. She explains through flashbacks that, even though she grew to trust and respect Batman, she was aware of him aging, getting slower, and getting weaker, thus accepting the idea of either Bruce retiring or being killed at some point. Finding the idea of a world without Batman unacceptable, Waller used her Project Cadmus connections to gather the technology for &quot;Project Batman Beyond&quot;, whose goal was to physically create a new Batman, starting with a secretly collected sample of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s DNA. Some years after Bruce retired, Waller found a young Neo-Gotham couple—the McGinnises—with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce&#x27;s parents, a nanotech solution was injected into Warren McGinnis to rewrite his reproductive material with that of Bruce. The eventual result was his wife Mary McGinnis giving birth to Terry, a child sharing the genetic traits of his mother and Bruce Wayne. When Terry was eight years old, Waller employed an elderly Andrea Beaumont in her Phantasm alias as an assassin to kill Terry&#x27;s family, hoping the trauma would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that she would be doing something against what Bruce stood for. Waller eventually conceded that Beaumont had been right and abolished the project altogether. Eight years afterward, Warren would be murdered because of Derek Powers, and Terry would meet Bruce by happenstance—resulting in Terry becoming Batman&#x27;s successor. Waller concludes by reminding Terry that he is Bruce&#x27;s son, not his clone, and that, despite the circumstances of his existence, he still has free will to live out his own life; Although not his clone she later tells Terry how he is not even close to as smart as Bruce Wayne but he does have his heart. Terry comes to terms with his revelations, and continues in being Batman. With a new sense of purpose, Terry plans to propose to Dana, while continuing his life of crimefighting.

===Animation===
In order to complete the series, Warner Bros. Animation outsourced &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; to Dong Yang Animation, Koko Enterprises and Seoul Movie (a subsidiary of TMS) in Seoul, South Korea. While the South Korean studios animated the series&#x27; episodes, the feature film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot; was animated by TMS Entertainment in Tokyo, Japan.

==Soundtrack==

Released on August 31, 1999, the soundtrack to &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; features many of the same composers who worked on the previous animated &quot;Batman&quot; shows. The music style is more industrial, with some metal influence, to tie in with the show&#x27;s futuristic cyberpunk genre.
==Critical reception==
While the idea of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; seemed as if it were &quot;not a proper continuation of the legacy of the Dark Knight&quot;, the series received critical acclaim and a cult following after its release. It has been praised for its dark and cyberpunk storytelling. The show was nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, two of which it won in 2001 for Outstanding Special Class Animated Program and Outstanding Music Direction and Composition. In addition, the show was nominated for five Annie Awards and won two of those nominations in 1999 and 2001. In 2009, IGN.com named &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; the 40th-best animated television series of all time.

Den of Geek, when listing the best episodes of the series, wrote that &quot;Batman Beyond&#x27;s first year on the air represents the show at its most realized form. It&#x27;s the only season of the show that&#x27;s written at the same level of quality as &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;. Not to say that later seasons don&#x27;t have their moments, but it seemed like the writers approached Beyond as a Saturday morning cartoon during seasons two and three, whereas during season one, they most certainly did not.&quot; Creator Bruce Timm has stated &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; is the most uneven series of the main DC Animated Universe shows, particular in regards to the latter two seasons. Greg Weisman commented that while the series was well made, it felt more like a Spider-Man series and much less like Batman. &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; was even cited by young actor Jacob Bertrand, of &quot;Cobrai Kai&quot; fame, who would go on to voice-portray Bam the Batmobile in the early-2020&#x27;s children&#x27;s animated TV series, &quot;Batwheels&quot;, as &quot;Beyond&quot;&#x27;s what got him into the Batman franchise in the first place.

==Home media==
===VHS===
Some episodes of the series were released on VHS from 1999 to 2000, including the series&#x27; premiere (as &quot;Batman Beyond: The Movie&quot;), and select episodes as five VHS volumes containing three episodes per tape (the same contents as the individual DVD volume releases, see below), and the direct-to-video film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot; (edited version).

Forty-one of the episodes and &quot;Return of the Joker&quot; were remastered. The remaining 11 episodes were an upconversion.

==Spin-off==

A spin-off from &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, an animated series called &quot;The Zeta Project&quot;, featured a revamped version of the synthoid Zeta from the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; episode &quot;Zeta&quot;. Batman would guest star in the episode &quot;Shadows&quot;. The super villain Stalker was to have appeared in &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; episode &quot;Taffy Time&quot;, but ultimately did not do so. The second-season episode &quot;Ro&#x27;s Gift&quot; has an appearance by the Brain Trust from the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; episode &quot;Mind Games&quot;. Terry McGinnis/Batman was originally slated to appear in this episode as well, but was cut since Bruce Timm and company were working on &quot;Justice League&quot;.

===Toys===
In 1999, Hasbro had released a &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; Toyline with sub-lines, In 2000, Burger King included &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; toys in their kids&#x27; meals.

===Films===

A direct-to-video feature film, &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;, was released on December 12, 2000. The original release was censored for elements of violence and death following the Columbine High School massacre, though a second, uncensored version was later released. Nevertheless, it received critical acclaim for its story, voice acting, animation and score. A second &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; film, focusing on the origins of Terry McGinnis, multiple clones of Bruce Wayne and the appearance of an elderly Selina Kyle, was planned by Bruce Timm and Glen Murakami, though it was never scripted, as it never went beyond a 45-minute impromptu plotting session between the two. The project was scrapped due to the dark tones and controversies surrounding &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;. Despite this, the plot elements were eventually reworked into the second-season finale of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; titled &quot;Epilogue&quot; (which was intended to be the series finale until the show was renewed for a third and final season) where Terry discovers his genetic origins. Amanda Waller planted Bruce Wayne&#x27;s DNA into Warren McGinnis through his routine flu shot and later helps create a copy of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle is briefly mentioned in passing.

Among the live action films proposed between the critical failure of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; and the reboot of the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise was &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;. In August 2000, Warner Bros. announced that it was developing a live-action film adaptation with Boaz Yakin attached to co-write and direct. The TV series&#x27; creators, Dini and Alan Burnett, were hired to write a screenplay for the feature film, with Neal Stephenson as consultant. Yakin hoped to cast Clint Eastwood as the retired Batman. By July 2001, a first draft was turned in to the studio, and the writers were waiting to see if a rewrite would be needed. The studio, also exploring other takes of Batman in development eventually placed &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; on hold in August 2001, but ultimately canceled the proposal. Yakin reportedly wanted the film to be dark, nihilistic, and with swearing and violence, and not the PG-13 film the studio wanted.

In January 2019, rumors began to circulate that Warner Animation Group was developing an animated &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; film following the critical and commercial success of Sony Pictures Animation&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, but was later reported that no such film was in the works. In the later August interview with DC Universe, Paul Dini revealed that Warner Bros. continues to express interest in a film adaptation but have put emphasis on other projects. Actor Tyler Posey has expressed interest in playing Terry McGinnis in the possible film adaptation. In June 2020, Michael Keaton entered talks to play an elderly Bruce Wayne, reprising his role from Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), in the DCEU film, &quot;The Flash&quot;, which was set for release in 2023. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Warner Bros. hopes for Keaton to return for multiple DCEU films in a way &quot;akin to the role played by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something of a mentor or guide or even string-puller&quot;. Keaton was officially confirmed to return in August of the same year. In December 2022, it was announced that Christina Hodson, writer of &quot;The Flash&quot; and the cancelled &quot;Batgirl&quot; film, had been hired to write a script for a live-action Batman Beyond film. The plot would have involved an aged Bruce Wayne, continuing the plot threads from his appearance in &quot;The Flash&quot;, and would have included the return of Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s Catwoman. Development on the film was shelved after James Gunn and Peter Safran were appointed as co-heads of DC Studios. In January 2023, Gunn and Safran stated that there is potential for a future multiverse project in which they may incorporate Keaton&#x27;s incarnation of Batman.

In March 2023 it was reported that an animated &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; film had been put into development, written by Daniel Casey and serving as WB&#x27;s answer to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;: &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. However, the project was put into commission under the leadership of Walter Hamada, who served as DC Films president from 2018 to 2022, and it is currently unknown if it is still happening under Gunn and Safran&#x27;s direction, though Jeff Sneider of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted that nobody who was working on the project was told it was cancelled.

===Video games===
The first appearance of the Terry McGinnis version of Batman in a video game is in the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color video game &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;.

The &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; Batsuit appears as an alternate costume in &quot;Justice League Heroes&quot; and as downloadable content in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

A &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; DLC was included in the third &quot;Lego Batman&quot; video game.

A &quot;Batman of the Future&quot; character pack featuring the Terry McGinnis Batman with all its trademark gadgets (such as the flying suit and the ability to turn invisible) and other &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;-era characters were revealed to be PS3/PS4-exclusive DLC for &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;.

Rocksteady Studios created their own unique take on the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; Batsuit for &quot;&quot; as a pre-order bonus along with &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; Batsuit titled &quot;Gotham&#x27;s Future Pack&quot;.

Batman Beyond appears in the mobile games &quot;Teeny Titans&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans Go! Figure&quot;.

===Animation===
In April 2014, a &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; short by Darwyn Cooke premiered at WonderCon. The short, which saw Will Friedle and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles, sees Batman (Terry McGinnis) battle a Batman android (resembling the design from &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;) in the Batcave with help from the elderly Bruce Wayne and the Batmobile (resembling the design from &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;). Once defeated, Batman and Bruce look out to see and prepare to fight seven additional invading androids resembling the designs from &quot;Beware the Batman&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; (1989 film), &quot;Batman&quot; (1960s TV series), and the original design by Bill Finger. Though the androids&#x27; source is unstated, they are reminiscent of the story arc from &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; involving the computer program HARDAC.

&quot;Batman Beyond&quot; is alluded in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; In the episode &quot;Sandwich Thief&quot;, Robin travels to the future to his father Nightwing&#x27;s apartment where a poster of the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; Batman can be seen, indicating that Nightwing admires this incarnation of Batman.

<text>Celtis is a genus of about 60–70 species of deciduous trees, commonly known as hackberries or nettle trees, in the hemp family Cannabaceae. It has a cosmopolitan distribution.

==Description==
&quot;Celtis&quot; species are generally medium-sized trees, reaching tall, rarely up to tall. The leaves are alternate, simple, long, ovate-acuminate, and evenly serrated margins. Diagnostically, &quot;Celtis&quot; can be very similar to trees in the Rosaceae and other rose motif families.

Small flowers of this monoecious plant appear in early spring while the leaves are still developing. Male flowers are longer and hairy. Female flowers are greenish and more rounded.

The fruit is a small drupe in diameter, edible in many species, with a dryish but sweet, sugary consistency, reminiscent of a date.

==Taxonomy==
Previously included either in the elm family (Ulmaceae) or a separate family, Celtidaceae, the APG III system places &quot;Celtis&quot; in an expanded hemp family (Cannabaceae).

=== Phylogeny ===
Members of the genus are present in the fossil record as early as the Miocene of Europe, and Paleocene of North America and eastern Asia.

=== Etymology ===
The derivation of the name of this genus, &quot;&quot;, is from a Latin word for an unrelated plant, the &quot;lotus tree&quot; of North Africa. The word was applied to this taxon by Linnaeus for unknown reasons.

===Species===
, the following 68 species are accepted by Plants of the World Online.

==== Removed from genus ====
* &quot;Trema cannabina&quot; (as &quot;C. amboinensis&quot; )
* &quot;Trema lamarckianum&quot; (as &quot;C. lamarckiana&quot; )
* &quot;Trema orientalis&quot; (as &quot;C. guineensis&quot; or &quot;C. orientalis&quot; )
* &quot;Trema tomentosa&quot; (as &quot;C. aspera&quot; or &quot;C. tomentosa&quot; )

==Distribution and habitat==
The genus is widespread throughout tropical and temperate parts of the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica.

==Ecology==
Some species, including common hackberry (&quot;C. occidentalis&quot;) and &quot;C. brasiliensis&quot;, are honey plants and a pollen source for honeybees of lesser importance.

===Lepidoptera===
&quot;Celtis&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera. These include mainly brush-footed butterflies, most importantly the distinct genus &quot;Libythea&quot; (beak butterflies) and some Apaturinae (emperor butterflies):
* &quot;Acytolepis puspa&quot; – common hedge blue, recorded on Chinese hackberry (&quot;C. sinensis&quot;)
* &quot;Automeris io&quot; – Io moth, recorded on southern hackberry (&quot;C. laevigata&quot;)
* &quot;Asterocampa celtis&quot; – hackberry butterfly or hackberry emperor
* &quot;Libythea celtis&quot; – European beak
* &quot;Libythea labdaca&quot; – African beak
* &quot;Libythea lepita&quot; – common beak
* &quot;Libythea myrrha&quot; – club beak, recorded on &quot;C. tetrandra&quot;
* &quot;Libytheana carinenta&quot; – American snout or common snout butterfly
* &quot;Nymphalis xanthomelas&quot; – scarce tortoiseshell, recorded on European hackberry (&quot;C. australis&quot;)
* &quot;Sasakia charonda&quot; – great purple emperor, recorded on &quot;C. jessoensis&quot; and &quot;C. sinensis&quot;
* A putative new taxon of the two-barred flasher (&quot;Astraptes fulgerator&quot;) cryptic species complex, provisionally called &quot;CELT,&quot; has hitherto only been found on &quot;C. iguanaea&quot;.

===Pathogens===
The plant pathogenic basidiomycete fungus &quot;Perenniporia celtis&quot; was first described from a &quot;Celtis&quot; host plant. Some species of &quot;Celtis&quot; are threatened by habitat destruction.

==Uses==

Several species are grown as ornamental trees, valued for their drought tolerance. They are a regular feature of arboreta and botanical gardens, particularly in North America. Chinese hackberry (&quot;C. sinensis&quot;) is suited for bonsai culture; a magnificent specimen in Daegu-myeon is one of the natural monuments of South Korea. 

The berries are generally edible when they ripen and fall. &quot;C. occidentalis&quot; fruit was used by the Omaha, eaten casually, as well as the Dakota people, who pounded them fine, seeds and all. The Pawnee used the pounded fruits in combination with fat and parched corn. The berries of &quot;C. douglasii&quot; are also edible, and were consumed by the Mescalero Apaches.

Hackberry wood is sometimes used in cabinetry and woodworking.
