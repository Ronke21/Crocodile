<text>St. John&#x27;s College is a private liberal arts college with campuses in Annapolis, Maryland and Santa Fe, New Mexico. As the successor institution of King William&#x27;s School, a preparatory school founded in 1696, St. John&#x27;s is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the United States; the current institution received a collegiate charter in 1784. In 1937, St. John&#x27;s adopted a Great Books curriculum based on discussion of works from the Western canon of philosophical, religious, historical, mathematical, scientific, and literary works.

The college grants a single bachelor&#x27;s degree in liberal arts. The awarded degree is equivalent to a double major in philosophy and the history of mathematics and science, and a double minor in classical studies and comparative literature. Two master&#x27;s degrees are available through the college&#x27;s graduate institute: one in liberal arts, which is a modified version of the undergraduate curriculum; and one in Eastern Classics, exclusive to the Santa Fe campus, which applies a Great Books curriculum to classic works from India, China, and Japan.

==History==
===Old program===
St. John&#x27;s College traces its origins to King William&#x27;s School, founded in 1696. King William&#x27;s School was founded with an affiliation to the Church of England. In 1784, Maryland chartered St. John&#x27;s College, which absorbed King William&#x27;s School when it opened in 1785. The college took up residence in a building known as Bladen&#x27;s Folly (the current McDowell Hall), which was originally built to be the Maryland governor&#x27;s mansion but was not completed. There was some association with the Freemasons early in the college&#x27;s history, leading to speculation that it was named after Saint John the Evangelist. The college&#x27;s original charter, reflecting the Masonic value of religious tolerance as well as the religious diversity of the founders (which included Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and the Roman Catholic Charles Carroll of Carrollton) stated that &quot;youth of all religious denominations shall be freely and liberally admitted&quot;. The college always maintained a small size, generally enrolling fewer than 500 men at a time.

In its early years, the college was at least nominally public—the college&#x27;s founders had envisaged it as the Western Shore branch of a proposed &quot;University of Maryland&quot;—but a lack of enthusiasm from the Maryland General Assembly and its Eastern Shore counterpart, Washington College, made this largely a paper institution. After years of inconsistent funding and litigation, the college accepted a smaller annual grant in lieu of being funded through the state&#x27;s annual appropriations process. The college closed during the Civil War, and its campus was used as a military hospital. In 1907, it became the undergraduate college of a loosely organized &quot;University of Maryland&quot; that included the professional schools located in Baltimore. By 1920, when Maryland State College (founded in 1857 as Maryland Agricultural College) became the University of Maryland at College Park, St. John&#x27;s was a free-standing private institution.

The college curriculum has taken various forms throughout its history. It began with a general program of study in the liberal arts, but St. John&#x27;s was a military school for much of the late 19th century and early 20th century. It ended compulsory military training with Major Enoch Garey&#x27;s accession as president in 1923.
Garey and the Navy instituted a Naval Reserve unit in September 1924, creating the first-ever collegiate Department of Naval Science in the United States. But despite St. John&#x27;s successfully pioneering the entire NROTC movement, student interest waned, and the voluntary ROTC disappeared in 1926 with Garey&#x27;s departure. The Naval Reserve unit followed by 1929.

===New program===

In 1936, the college lost its accreditation. The Board of Visitors and Governors, faced with dire financial straits caused by the Great Depression, invited educational innovators Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan to make a completely fresh start. They introduced a new program of study, which remains in effect today. Buchanan became dean of the college, while Barr assumed its presidency. In his guide &quot;Cool Colleges&quot;, Donald Asher writes that the New Program was implemented to save the college from closing: &quot;Several benefactors convinced the college to reject a watered-down curriculum in favor of becoming a very distinctive academic community. Thus this great institution was reborn as a survival measure.&quot;

In 1938, Walter Lippman wrote a column praising liberal arts education as a bulwark against fascism and said, &quot;In the future, men will point to St. John&#x27;s College and say that there was the seed-bed of the American renaissance.&quot;

In 1940, national attention was attracted to St. John&#x27;s by a story in &quot;Life&quot; entitled &quot;The Classics: At St. John&#x27;s They Come into Their Own Once More&quot;. Classic works unavailable in English translation were translated by faculty members, typed, mimeographed, and bound. They were sold to the general public as well as to students, and by 1941, the St. John&#x27;s College bookshop was famous as the only source for English translations of works such as Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De musica&quot;, and Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;.

The wartime years were difficult for the all-male St. John&#x27;s. Enlistment and the draft emptied the college; 15 seniors graduated in 1943, eight in 1945, and three in 1946. From 1940 to 1946, St. John&#x27;s was repeatedly confronted with threats of its land being seized by the Navy for expansion of the neighboring U.S. Naval Academy, and James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy, formally announced plans to do so in 1945. At the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which had expected a legal battle royale comparable to the 1819 &quot;Dartmouth&quot; case, commented that &quot;although a small college of fewer than 200 students, St. John&#x27;s has, because of its experimental liberal arts program, received more publicity and been the center of a greater academic controversy than most other colleges in the land. Its best-books program has been attacked and praised by leading educators of the day.&quot;

The constant threat of eviction discouraged Stringfellow Barr. In late 1946, Forrestal withdrew the plan to take over St. John&#x27;s in the face of public opposition and the disapproval of the House Naval Affairs Committee. Still, Barr and Scott Buchanan were already committed to leaving St. John&#x27;s and launching Liberal Arts, Inc., a new, similar college in Stockbridge, Massachusetts; that project eventually failed—but thinking about other sites for the college eventually led to the opening of St. John&#x27;s second campus in Santa Fe in 1964.

St John&#x27;s had been founded as an all-white institution and continued as such in the early years of the New Program, with Barr actively discouraging black students from applying. However, by 1948, faculty and student sentiment had shifted, and students, with the support of the faculty and administration, persuaded a reluctant Board of Visitors and Governors to integrate the college and St. John&#x27;s became one of the first previously all-white colleges south of the Mason-Dixon line to admit black students voluntarily.

In 1949, Richard D. Weigle became president of St. John&#x27;s. Following the chaotic and difficult period from 1940 to 1949, Weigle&#x27;s presidency continued for 31 years, during which time the New Program and the college itself became well established.

In 1951, St. John&#x27;s became coeducational, admitting women for the first time in its 254-year history. Some students objected because they had not been involved in—nor even aware of—the decision before it was announced to the media, and some believed that the college could not remain a serious institution if it admitted women. Martin Dyer reported that women who were admitted quickly proved they were the academic and intellectual equals of their male counterparts.

As enrollment grew during the 1950s, and facing the coming larger baby-boom generation, thoughts turned again towards opening another campus—but this time in addition to, not instead of, the one in Annapolis. Serious talk of expansion began in 1959 when the father of a student from Monterey, California, suggested to President Weigle that he establish a new campus there. &quot;Time&quot; ran an article on the college&#x27;s possible expansion plans, and 32 offers came into the college from New Hampshire, Oregon, Georgia, Alaska, Florida, Connecticut, and other states.

A group from the Monterey Peninsula told Weigle that they were interested, though funding was a problem, and suitable land was a big question. There was also an offer of land in Claremont, California, but competition with the other colleges there for students and financial contributions was a negative. The Riverside Mission Inn (in Riverside, California) was another possibility, but with only of land and many renovations needed to the inn, funding was again a significant issue.

The three California locations were all still major contenders when Robert McKinney (publisher of &quot;The Santa Fe New Mexican&quot; and a former SJC board member) called and told Weigle that a group of city leaders had long been looking for another college for Santa Fe. During a lunch Weigle attended at John Gaw Meem&#x27;s house on the outskirts of Santa Fe in late January 1961, Meem volunteered that he had a little piece of land () that he would gladly donate to the college. After lunch, Weigle looked at the land and instantly fell in love with it. A committee of four faculty members (Robert Bart, Barbara Leonard, Douglas Allanbrook, and William Darkey) later visited the four sites in contention and, after much deliberation, recommended Santa Fe.

In 1961, the governing board of St. John&#x27;s approved plans to establish a second college at Santa Fe. Groundbreaking occurred on April 22, 1963, and the first classes began in 1964. Immediately afterward, land on the Monterey Peninsula was also donated to the college on the condition that a campus be developed there by a certain date.

==Academics==
===Great Books program===
The Great Books program (often called simply &quot;the Program&quot; or &quot;the New Program&quot; at St. John&#x27;s) was developed at the University of Chicago by Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, Robert Hutchins, and Mortimer Adler in the mid-1930s as an alternative form of education to the then rapidly changing undergraduate curriculum. St. John&#x27;s adopted the Great Books program in 1937 when the college faced financial and academic ruin. The Great Books program in use today was also heavily influenced by Jacob Klein, who was dean of the college in the 1940s and 1950s.

The four-year program of study, nearly all mandatory, requires that students read and discuss the works of many of Western civilization&#x27;s most prominent contributors to philosophy, theology, mathematics, science, music, poetry, and literature. Tutorials (mathematics, language, and music) and seminar and laboratory are discussion-based. In the mathematics tutorial, students often demonstrate propositions that mathematicians of various ages have laid out. In the language tutorial student translations are presented (ancient Greek is studied in the first two years and French for the last two). The tutorials, with seminars and laboratories, constitute the classes. All classes, particularly the seminar, are considered formal exercises; consequently, students address one another and their teachers by their honorific and last name during class.

St. John&#x27;s avoids modern textbooks, lectures, and examinations in favor of a series of manuals. While traditional (A to F) grades are given and provided on transcripts, the culture of the school de-emphasizes their importance, and grades are released only at the request of the student. Grading is based largely on class participation and papers. As faculty members are called at the college, tutors play a non-directive role in the classroom, compared to mainstream colleges. However, this varies according to the course and instructor at St. John&#x27;s. The class size is small on both campuses, with a student-to-tutor ratio of 7:1. The seminar is the largest class, with around 20 students, and is led by two tutors. Daytime tutorials are smaller, typically ranging between 12 and 16 students, and are led by one tutor. Preceptorials are the smallest class size, ranging between 3 and 9 students.

The program involves:
* Four years of literature, philosophy, and political science in seminar
* Four years of mathematics
* Three years of laboratory science
* Four years of language (Ancient Greek, Middle/Early English, and French)
* First-year chorus followed by sophomore-year music

The Great Books are not the only texts used at St. John&#x27;s. Greek and French classes use supplemental materials that are more like traditional textbooks. Science laboratory and mathematics courses use manuals prepared by faculty members that combine source materials with workbook exercises. For example, the mathematics tutorial combines a 1905 paper by Albert Einstein with exercises that require the student to work through the mathematics used in the paper.

===Graduate Institute Liberal Arts program===
The Graduate Institute in Liberal Education was established at St. John&#x27;s College in 1967 as a summer program on the Santa Fe campus. The size and scope of the Institute have expanded so that currently, both the Annapolis and Santa Fe campuses offer year-round graduate-level study based on the principles of St. John&#x27;s undergraduate program. Students in the Liberal Arts program explore the persisting questions of human existence by studying classic works of the Western tradition. This program is organized into five semester-long thematic segments: Philosophy and Theology, Politics and Society, Literature, Mathematics and Natural Science, and History. Students earn a Master of Arts in Liberal Arts (MALA) by completing four of these five segments. A common curriculum provides the basis for a shared intellectual community; discussion with fellow students and faculty is the mode of learning inside and outside the classroom. Each semester, students attend a seminar, a tutorial, and a preceptorial, all carried out as small-group discussions under the guidance of St. John&#x27;s faculty members. These three types of classes are the framework of the distinctive St. John&#x27;s educational experience.

===Eastern Classics program===
At the Santa Fe campus, there is a program offering a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics (MAEC). This program is three semesters long and is designed to be completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program could not do justice to the Great Books of the three main Asian traditions (India, China and Japan) by trying to squeeze in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program, therefore, provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious, and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only Confucius, Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also Mencius, Xun Zi, Han Feizi, and Mozi, as well as historical narratives by Sima Qian and the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, the later movement of Neo-Confucianism and Zhu Xi, narrative works such as &quot;Journey to the West&quot; or the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and the great Chinese poets, Li Bai, Wang Wei and Du Fu. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of Hinduism and the development of Theravada, Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, as well as such literary masterpieces as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Shakuntala&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot;, and others. Students also take a language, either Sanskrit or Classical Chinese.

===Mitchell Art Museum===
In 1989, with a generous gift from Elizabeth Myers Mitchell and her husband Carlton Mitchell (a well-known sailor), the college built a campus gallery known as the Elizabeth Myers Mitchell Art Gallery to present museum-quality exhibitions to the greater Annapolis community. In 2014, the gallery achieved national accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums. In 2023, the name was changed to the Elizabeth Myers Mitchell Art Museum to celebrate the accreditation.

===Rankings===
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked St. John’s #75 in National Liberal Arts Colleges, #35 in Best Value Schools, and #25 in Best Undergraduate Teaching out of 211 Best National Liberal Arts Colleges.

==Campuses==
===Annapolis campus===
St. John&#x27;s is located in the Historic Annapolis district, one block from the Maryland State Capitol building. Its proximity to the United States Naval Academy (across King George Street) has inspired many comparisons to Athens and Sparta. The two schools carry on a spirited rivalry seen in their annual croquet match on the front lawn of St. John&#x27;s, which has been called by &quot;GQ&quot; &quot;the purest intercollegiate athletic event in America.&quot; St. John&#x27;s has won 32 of the 40 annual matches. About the Johnnies&#x27; commitment to the event, one midshipman commented, &quot;They&#x27;re out practicing croquet every afternoon! Alabama should take football this seriously.&quot;

Construction of McDowell Hall at the center of the campus began in 1742 by Provincial Governor of Maryland Thomas Bladen. Still, it was not completed until after the end of the Colonial period. The 23,000-square-foot historic building underwent improvements in 2017–18. Its Great Hall has seen many college events, from balls feting Generals Lafayette and Washington to the unique St. John&#x27;s institutions called waltz parties.

Mellon Hall, constructed in 1958, was designed by noted architect Richard Neutra.

====St. John&#x27;s College Observatory====
The observatory facility, located at the top of the Foucault pendulum tower in Mellon Hall, contains two permanently mounted telescopes, a 12&quot; Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope model LX200 and a 16&quot; Newtonian telescope, both made by Meade Instruments. The Foucault Pendulum is at the top of the four-story tower. The pendulum drive magnet is housed within a cast iron cone in the Observatory facility. The magnet is keyed to turn on and off as the pendulum swings by using technology such as a photoresistor that determines the center of the pendulum&#x27;s swing.

===Santa Fe campus===
St. John&#x27;s Santa Fe campus is located on the eastern edge of Santa Fe, close to Atalaya Mountain. It was opened in 1964 in response to the increase in qualified applicants at the Annapolis campus. The college chose to open a second campus rather than increase the size of the Annapolis campus. The second campus was part of a larger project to construct six campuses nationwide. St. John&#x27;s abandoned the concept when it sold a tract of land it owned in Monterey, California.

===Student body===
Within the Class of 2022, 36 U.S. states and 15 countries are represented. Approximately 99% of students receive financial aid. First-year undergraduate students range in age from 15 to 65. The student body is relatively small compared to other liberal arts colleges, with a population historically below 500 students on each campus during a year. The average ratio is six students for each professor. The college offers many community seminars and lectures available to the public.

====Admissions====
St. John’s has been test-optional for 40 years. While the Admissions Committee will assess traditional factors such as academic record, grades, and any test scores provided, it evaluates applicants through admission essays and interviews. In 2023, the college accepted 49.9% of applicants, with those admitted having an average of 3.81 GPA and those submitting test scores having an average 1250–1460 SAT, or average 30-33 ACT, score.

<text>Diversion airports are airports capable of handling a particular ETOPS-rated aircraft during an emergency landing and whose flying distance at the point of emergency does not exceed the ETOPS diversion period for that aircraft.

Any airport designated as an en route diversion airport must have the facilities to safely support that particular aircraft, and weather conditions at the time of arrival must allow a safe landing with an engine or systems malfunctioning.

An ETOPS/LROPS flight may be conducted solely if the diversion airports are available throughout the length of the flight. Unavailability due to bad weather, for example, might require an inflight rerouting.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Plan 39&quot; is a system of pre-approved slots at diversion airports, for certain airlines and aircraft types only, for use in a &quot;mass diversion&quot; event such as a runway closure or severe weather.

<doc id="429421" wikidata="Q5949" url="?curid=429421" title="St. Vitus Cathedral">
<text>The Metropolitan Cathedral of [[Saint]]s [[Saint Vitus|Vitus]], [[Saint Wenceslaus|Wenceslaus]] and [[Adalbert of Prague|Adalbert]] () is a Catholic metropolitan cathedral in Prague, and the seat of the Archbishop of Prague. Until 1997, the cathedral was dedicated only to Saint Vitus, and is still commonly named only as St. Vitus Cathedral ( or &quot;svatovítská katedrála&quot;).

This cathedral is a prominent example of Gothic architecture, and is the largest and most important church in the country. Located within Prague Castle and containing the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors, the cathedral is under the ownership of the Czech government as part of the Prague Castle complex. The cathedral&#x27;s dimensions are , the main tower is high, front towers , arch height .

==History==
===Origins===
The current cathedral is the third of a series of religious buildings at the site, all dedicated to St. Vitus. The first church was an early Romanesque rotunda founded by Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia in 930. This patron saint was chosen because Wenceslaus had acquired a holy relic – the arm of St. Vitus – from Emperor Henry I. It is also possible that Wenceslaus, wanting to convert his subjects to Christianity more easily, chose a saint whose name (&quot;Svatý Vít&quot; in Czech) sounds very much like the name of Slavic solar deity Svantevit. Two religious populations, the increasing Christian and decreasing pagan community, lived simultaneously in Prague castle at least until the 11th century.

In the year 1060, as the bishopric of Prague was founded, prince Spytihněv II embarked on building a more spacious church, as it became clear the existing rotunda was too small to accommodate the faithful. A much larger and more representative Romanesque basilica was built in its spot. Though still not completely reconstructed, most experts agree it was a triple-aisled basilica with two choirs and a pair of towers connected to the western transept. The design of the cathedral nods to Romanesque architecture of the Holy Roman Empire, most notably to the abbey church in Hildesheim and the Speyer Cathedral. The southern apse of the rotunda was incorporated into the eastern transept of the new church because it housed the tomb of St. Wenceslaus, who had by now become the patron saint of the Czech princes. A bishop&#x27;s mansion was also built south of the new church, and was considerably enlarged and extended in the mid-12th century.

===The Gothic cathedral===
Construction of the present-day Gothic cathedral began on 21 November 1344, when the seat of Prague was elevated to an archbishopric. King John of Bohemia laid the foundation stone for the new building. The patrons were the chapter of cathedral (led by a dean), the Archbishop Arnost of Pardubice, and, above all, Charles IV, King of Bohemia and a soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor, who intended the new cathedral to be a coronation church, family crypt, treasury for the most precious relics of the kingdom, and the last resting place cum pilgrimage site of patron saint Wenceslaus. The first master builder was a Frenchman Matthias of Arras, summoned from the Papal Palace in Avignon. Matthias designed the overall layout of the building as, basically, an import of French Gothic: a triple-naved basilica with flying buttresses, short transept, five-bayed choir and decagon apse with ambulatory and radiating chapels. However, he lived to build only the easternmost parts of the choir: the arcades and the ambulatory. The slender verticality of Late French Gothic and clear, almost rigid respect of proportions distinguish his work today.

After Matthias&#x27; death in 1352, 23-year-old Peter Parler assumed control of the cathedral workshop as master builder. He was son of the architect of the Heilig-Kreuz-Münster in Schwäbisch Gmünd. Initially, Parler only worked on plans left by his predecessor, building the sacristy on the north side of the choir and the chapel on the south. Once he finished all that Matthias left unfinished, he continued according to his own ideas. Parler&#x27;s bold and innovative design brought in a unique new synthesis of Gothic elements in architecture. This is best exemplified in the vaults he designed for the choir. The so-called Parler&#x27;s vaults or net-vaults have double (not single, as in classic High Gothic groin vaults) diagonal ribs that span the width of the choir-bay. The crossing pairs of ribs create a net-like construction (hence the name), which considerably strengthens the vault. They also give a lively ornamentation to the ceiling, as the interlocking vaulted bays create a dynamic zigzag pattern the length of the cathedral.
While Matthias of Arras was schooled as a geometer, thus putting an emphasis on rigid systems of proportions and clear, mathematical compositions in his design, Parler was trained as a sculptor and woodcarver. He treated architecture as a sculpture, almost as if playing with structural forms in stone. Aside from his bold vaults, the peculiarities of his work can also be seen in the design of pillars (with classic, bell-shaped columns which were almost forgotten by High Gothic), the ingenious dome vault of new St. Wenceslaus chapel, the undulating clerestory walls, the original window tracery (no two of his windows are the same, the ornamentation is always different) and the blind tracery panels of the buttresses. Architectural sculpture was given a considerable role while Parler was in charge of construction, as can be seen in the corbels, the passageway lintels, and, particularly, in the busts on the triforium, which depict faces of the royal family, saints, Prague bishops, and the two master builders, including Parler himself.

Work on the cathedral, however, proceeded slowly, because the Emperor commissioned Parler with many other projects, such as the construction of the new Charles Bridge in Prague and many churches throughout the Czech realm. By 1397, when Peter Parler died, only the choir and parts of the transept were finished.
After Peter Parler&#x27;s death in 1399 his sons, Wenzel Parler and particularly Johannes Parler, continued his work; they in turn were succeeded by a certain Master Petrilk, who by all accounts was also a member of Parler&#x27;s workshop. Under these three masters, the transept and the great tower on its south side were finished. So was the gable which connects the tower with the south transept. Nicknamed &#x27;Golden Gate&#x27; (likely because of the golden mosaic of Last Judgment depicted on it), it is through this portal that the kings entered the cathedral for coronation ceremonies.

The entire building process came to a halt with the beginning of Hussite War in the first half of 15th century. The war brought an end to the workshop that operated steadily over for almost a century, and the furnishings of cathedral, dozens of pictures and sculptures, suffered heavily from the ravages of Hussite iconoclasm. As if this was not enough, a great fire in 1541 heavily damaged the cathedral.

====St. Wenceslaus Chapel====

Perhaps the most outstanding place in the cathedral is the Chapel of St. Wenceslaus, which houses relics of the saint. Peter Parler constructed the room between 1356 (the year he took over) and 1364 with a ribbed vault. The lower portions of the walls are decorated with over 1300 semi-precious stones and paintings depicting the Passion of Christ dating from the original decoration of the chapel in 1372–1373. The upper area of the walls have paintings depicting the life of St. Wenceslaus, by the Master of the Litoměřice Altarpiece between 1506 and 1509. Above the altar, is a Gothic statue of St. Wenceslaus created by Jindřich Parler (Peter&#x27;s nephew) in 1373. The chapel is not open to the public, but it can be viewed from the doorways.

A small door with seven locks, in the southwest corner of the chapel, leads to the Crown Chamber containing the Czech crown jewels, which are displayed to the public only once every (circa) eight years.

===Renaissance and Baroque===
Through most of the following centuries, the cathedral stood only half-finished. It was built to the great tower and a transept, which was closed by a provisional wall. In the place of a three-aisled nave-to-be-built, a timber-roofed construction stood, and services were held separately there from the interior of the choir. Several attempts to continue the work on the cathedral were mostly unsuccessful. In the latter half of the 15th century, king Vladislaus II commissioned the great Renaissance-Gothic architect Benedict Ried to continue the work on the cathedral, but almost as soon as the work began, it was cut short because of lack of funds. Later attempts to finish the cathedral only brought some Renaissance and Baroque elements into the Gothic building, most notably the obviously different Baroque spire of the south tower by Nikolaus Pacassi (1753 until 1775) and the great organ in the northern wing of transept.
===Completion in 19th and 20th century===

In 1844, Václav Pešina, an energetic St. Vitus canon, together with Neo-Gothic architect Josef Kranner presented a program for renovation and completion of the great cathedral at the gathering of German architects in Prague. The same year a society under the full name &quot;Union for Completion of the Cathedral of St. Vitus in Prague&quot; was formed, whose aim was to repair, complete and rid the structure of &quot;everything mutilated and stylistically inimical&quot;. Josef Kranner headed the work from 1861 to 1866 which consisted mostly of repairs, removing Baroque decorations deemed unnecessary and restoring the interior. In 1870 workers finally laid the foundations of the new nave, and in 1873, after Kranner&#x27;s death, architect Josef Mocker assumed control of the reconstruction. He designed the west façade in a typical classic Gothic manner with two towers, and the same design was adopted, after his death, by the third and final architect of restoration, Kamil Hilbert.

In the 1920s the sculptor Vojtěch Sucharda worked on the façade, and the famous Czech Art Nouveau painter Alfons Mucha decorated the new windows in the north part of nave. Frantisek Kysela designed the rose window from 1925 to 1927, which depicts scenes from the Biblical story of creation. By the time of St. Wenceslaus jubilee in 1929, the St. Vitus cathedral was finally finished, nearly 600 years after it was begun. Despite the fact that the entire western half of the cathedral is a Neo-Gothic addition, much of the design and elements developed by Peter Parler were used in the restoration, giving the cathedral as a whole a harmonious, unified look.

===Recent history===
In 1997, on 1000th anniversary of the death of Saint Adalbert, the patrocinium (dedication) of the church was re-dedicated to Saint Wenceslaus and Saint Adalbert. The previous Romanesque basilica had this triple patrocinium to the main Bohemian patrons since 1038 when relics of Saint Adalbert were placed here. The skull of Saint Adalbert is kept at the Hilbert Treasury

In 1954, a government decree entrusted the whole Prague Castle into ownership of &quot;all Czechoslovak people&quot; and into administration of the President&#x27;s Office. Beginning in 1992, after the Velvet Revolution the church filed several petitions requesting a determination on the true owner of the structure. After 14 years, in June 2006, the City Court in Prague decided that the 1954 decree did not change the ownership of the cathedral and the owner is the Metropolitan Chapter at Saint Vitus. In September 2006, the President&#x27;s Office ceded the administration to the Metropolitan Chapter. However, in February 2007, the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic reversed the decision of the City Court and returned the case to the common court. In September 2007, the District Court of Prague 7 decided that the cathedral is owned by the Czech Republic, this decision was confirmed by the City Court in Prague and the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal of the Metropolitan Chapter, however noted that the chapter unquestionably owns the interior furnishings of the cathedral. The Metropolitan Chapter considered continuing the case in the European Court for Human Rights however in May 2010, the new Prague Archbishop Dominik Duka and the state president Václav Klaus together declared that they did not wish to continue with court conflicts. They constituted that the seven persons who are traditionally holders of the keys of the Saint Wenceslaus Chamber with the Bohemian Crown Jewels become also a board to coordinate and organize administration and use of the cathedral. However, controversy about ownership of some related canonry houses continues.

In July 2012, the Chamber of Deputies passed a bill to compensate the churches for property seized by the Communist government. The Senate approved the bill in November 2012 and the government implemented it the following June after clearing legal challenges.

==Organ==

The St. Vitus Cathedral has two organ casings. The upper façade belonged to a baroque organ, which was built in 1765 by Anton Gartner. It had 40 stops on 3 manuals and pedals. This case is purely decorative. The associated work was transported around 1909 and was lost.

The lower neoclassical casing contains today&#x27;s main organ. It was built by Josef Melzel in the years 1929–31. A general overhaul was carried out by the organ builder Brachtl a Kánský (1999–2001). The rather modest instrument in relation to the large church space has 58 stops on 3 manuals and pedals, 4,475 pipes in total. The action is purely pneumatic. With a large number of basic pipes (flutes and principals) and little reeds (trumpets), the instrument has a rather gentle tone – a typical feature of post-Romantic organs.

==Influence==
The Cathedral of St. Vitus had a tremendous influence on the development of Late Gothic style characteristic for Central Europe. Members of the Parler workshop, and indeed, the Parler family (both of which were established at the building site of St. Vitus) designed numerous churches and buildings across Central Europe. More notable examples include Stephansdom cathedral in Vienna, Strasbourg Cathedral, Church of St. Marko in Zagreb and the Church of St. Barbara in Kutna Hora, also in Czech Republic. Regional Gothic styles of Slovenia, northern Croatia, Austria, Czech Republic, and southern Germany were all heavily influenced by Parler&#x27;s design.

Of particular interest are Parler&#x27;s net vaults. The Late Gothic of Central Europe is characterised by ornate and extraordinary vaulting, a practice which was started by Parler&#x27;s development of his own vaulting system for the choir of St. Vitus Cathedral. Another regional Gothic style also displays amazing ingenuity and ornamentation in the design of vaults, the Perpendicular Style of English Gothic. A question remains of what was influenced by what. Some British art and architecture historians suspected that Peter Parler might have travelled to England at some point in his life, studying the great English Gothic cathedrals, which then inspired his work on St. Vitus. However, taking into account that the Perpendicular style and the use of truly extravagant vaults in English Gothic began at the very end of 14th century, it is also quite possible that it was St. Vitus Cathedral of Prague that influenced the development of English Gothic.

<text>Sir Hugh Maxwell Casson (23 May 1910 – 15 August 1999) was a British architect, also active as an interior designer, an artist, and a writer and broadcaster on twentieth-century design. He was the director of architecture for the 1951 Festival of Britain. From 1976 to 1984, he was president of the Royal Academy.

== Life ==

Casson was born in London on 23 May 1910, spending his early years in Burma—where his father was posted with the Indian Civil Service—before being sent back to England for education. He was the nephew of the actor Lewis Casson and his wife the actress Sybil Thorndike. Casson was educated at Eastbourne College in East Sussex, then at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1929–31), where his subject was architecture, after which he spent time at the Bartlett School of Architecture in Bloomsbury, London, and the British School at Athens. He met his future wife, Margaret Macdonald Troup (1913–1995), an architect and designer who taught design at the Royal College of Art, while they were both students. The couple married in 1938 and had three daughters.

== Work ==
Before the Second World War, Casson divided his time between teaching at the Cambridge School of Architecture and working in the London office of his Cambridge tutor, Christopher (Kit) Nicholson. He wrote the book &quot;New Sights of London&quot; in 1938 for London Transport, championing modern architecture within reach of London, while remaining critical of the UK&#x27;s record in innovative building. &quot;He does not mince his words&quot;, commented the &quot;Architect and Building News&quot; on the cover. During the war, he worked in the Camouflage Service of the Air Ministry.

Casson was appointed to his role as director of architecture of the Festival of Britain on the South Bank in 1948 at the age of 38, and set out to celebrate peace and modernity through the appointment of other young architects. For example, the Modernist design of the Royal Festival Hall was led by a 39-year-old, Leslie Martin. Casson&#x27;s Festival achievements led to his being made a (Knight Bachelor) in 1952. The following year he designed street decorations in Westminster for the Coronation of Elizabeth II.

After the war, and alongside his Festival work, Casson went into partnership with young architect Neville Conder. Their projects included corporate headquarters buildings, university campuses, the Elephant House at London Zoo, a building for the Royal College of Art (where Casson was Professor of Interior Design from 1955 to 1975, and later served as Provost), the Microbiology Building (Belfast), and the master planning and design of the Sidgwick Avenue arts faculty buildings for the University of Cambridge, including the Austin Robinson Building which houses the Faculty of Economics as well as the Marshall Library of Economics. This latter project lasted some thirty years.

Casson was a friend of members of the British royal family and is reported to have taught watercolour painting to Prince Charles. In 1955, he designed the interiors for the new royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;; he also designed interiors for suites at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

From 1953 to 1975, he was professor of environmental design at the Royal College of Art, where his wife Margaret was senior tutor. 

In the 1980s Casson became a television presenter, with his own series, &quot;Personal Pleasures with Sir Hugh Casson&quot;, about stately homes and places he enjoyed.

Casson supplied watercolour illustrations for a new edition of Sir John Betjeman&#x27;s verse autobiography &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot; (1960); &quot;The Illustrated &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot;&quot; was published by John Murray in 1989.

== Reception ==
After his work for the Festival of Britain, Casson was knighted in the New Year Honours of 1952. He was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1978, and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1985.

He was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy in 1962, and a full member in 1970. He was treasurer in 1975–1976, and president from 1976 to 1984. During the Summer Exhibition the academy awards an annual Hugh Casson Drawing Prize &quot;for an original work on paper in any medium, where the emphasis is clearly on drawing&quot;, and a room in the Keeper&#x27;s House is named after him.

From 1982 to 2017 &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine gave the Sir Hugh Casson Award for the &quot;Worst New Building of the Year&quot;.

An archive of Casson&#x27;s papers is held by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Photographs attributed to him are held in the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, whose archive, of primarily architectural images, is being digitised under the wider Courtauld Connects project.

<text>In quantum mechanics, a probability amplitude is a complex number used for describing the behaviour of systems. The square of the modulus of this quantity at a point in space represents a probability density at that point.

Probability amplitudes provide a relationship between the quantum state vector of a system and the results of observations of that system, a link that was first proposed by Max Born, in 1926. Interpretation of values of a wave function as the probability amplitude is a pillar of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. In fact, the properties of the space of wave functions were being used to make physical predictions (such as emissions from atoms being at certain discrete energies) before any physical interpretation of a particular function was offered. Born was awarded half of the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for this understanding, and the probability thus calculated is sometimes called the &quot;Born probability&quot;. These probabilistic concepts, namely the probability density and quantum measurements, were vigorously contested at the time by the original physicists working on the theory, such as Schrödinger and Einstein. It is the source of the mysterious consequences and philosophical difficulties in the interpretations of quantum mechanics—topics that continue to be debated even today.

== Physical overview ==
Neglecting some technical complexities, the problem of quantum measurement is the behaviour of a quantum state, for which the value of the observable to be measured is uncertain. Such a state is thought to be a coherent superposition of the observable&#x27;s &quot;eigenstates&quot;, states on which the value of the observable is uniquely defined, for different possible values of the observable.

When a measurement of is made, the system (under the Copenhagen interpretation) &quot;jumps&quot; to one of the eigenstates, returning the eigenvalue belonging to that eigenstate. The system may always be described by a linear combination or superposition of these eigenstates with unequal &quot;weights&quot;. Intuitively it is clear that eigenstates with heavier &quot;weights&quot; are more &quot;likely&quot; to be produced. Indeed, which of the above eigenstates the system jumps to is given by a probabilistic law: the probability of the system jumping to the state is proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding numerical weight squared. These numerical weights are called probability amplitudes, and this relationship used to calculate probabilities from given pure quantum states (such as wave functions) is called the Born rule.

Clearly, the sum of the probabilities, which equals the sum of the absolute squares of the probability amplitudes, must equal 1. This is the normalization requirement.

If the system is known to be in some eigenstate of (e.g. after an observation of the corresponding eigenvalue of ) the probability of observing that eigenvalue becomes equal to 1 (certain) for all subsequent measurements of (so long as no other important forces act between the measurements). In other words, the probability amplitudes are zero for all the other eigenstates, and remain zero for the future measurements. If the set of eigenstates to which the system can jump upon measurement of is the same as the set of eigenstates for measurement of , then subsequent measurements of either or always produce the same values with probability of 1, no matter the order in which they are applied. The probability amplitudes are unaffected by either measurement, and the observables are said to commute.

By contrast, if the eigenstates of and are different, then measurement of produces a jump to a state that is not an eigenstate of . Therefore, if the system is known to be in some eigenstate of (all probability amplitudes zero except for one eigenstate), then when is observed the probability amplitudes are changed. A second, subsequent observation of no longer certainly produces the eigenvalue corresponding to the starting state. In other words, the probability amplitudes for the second measurement of depend on whether it comes before or after a measurement of , and the two observables do not commute.

==Mathematical formulation==

In a formal setup, the state of an isolated physical system in quantum mechanics is represented, at a fixed time formula_1, by a state vector belonging to a separable complex Hilbert space. Using bra–ket notation the relation between state vector and &quot;position basis&quot; formula_2 of the Hilbert space can be written as 
:formula_3.
Its relation with an observable can be elucidated by generalizing the quantum state formula_4 to a measurable function and its domain of definition to a given -finite measure space formula_5. This allows for a refinement of Lebesgue&#x27;s decomposition theorem, decomposing &quot;μ&quot; into three mutually singular parts
:formula_6
where &quot;μ&quot;ac is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, &quot;μ&quot;sc is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and atomless, and &quot;μ&quot;pp is a pure point measure.

===Continuous amplitudes===

A usual presentation of the probability amplitude is that of a wave function formula_4 belonging to the space of (equivalence classes of) square integrable functions, i.e., formula_4 belongs to if and only if
:formula_9.
If the norm is equal to and formula_10 such that
:formula_11,
then formula_12 is the probability density function for a measurement of the particle&#x27;s position at a given time, defined as the Radon–Nikodym derivative with respect to the Lebesgue measure (e.g. on the set of all real numbers). As probability is a dimensionless quantity, must have the inverse dimension of the variable of integration . For example, the above amplitude has dimension [L−1/2], where L represents length. 

Whereas a Hilbert space is separable if and only if it admits a countable orthonormal basis, the range of a continuous random variable formula_13 is an uncountable set (i.e. the probability that the system is &quot;at position formula_13&quot; will always be zero). As such, eigenstates of an observable need not necessarily be measurable functions belonging to (see normalization condition below). A typical example is the position operator formula_15 defined as
:formula_16
whose eigenfunctions are Dirac delta functions
:formula_17
which clearly do not belong to . By replacing the state space by a suitable rigged Hilbert space, however, the rigorous notion of eigenstates from spectral theorem as well as spectral decomposition is preserved.

===Discrete amplitudes===

Let formula_18 be atomic (i.e. the set formula_19 in formula_20 is an &quot;atom&quot;); specifying the measure of any discrete variable equal to . The amplitudes are composed of state vector indexed by ; its components are denoted by for uniformity with the previous case. If the -norm of is equal to 1, then is a probability mass function.

A convenient configuration space is such that each point produces some unique value of the observable . For discrete it means that all elements of the standard basis are eigenvectors of . Then formula_21 is the probability amplitude for the eigenstate . If it corresponds to a non-degenerate eigenvalue of , then formula_22 gives the probability of the corresponding value of for the initial state .

 if and only if is the same quantum state as . if and only if and are orthogonal. Otherwise the modulus of is between 0 and 1.

A discrete probability amplitude may be considered as a fundamental frequency in the probability frequency domain (spherical harmonics) for the purposes of simplifying M-theory transformation calculations. Discrete dynamical variables are used in such problems as a particle in an idealized reflective box and quantum harmonic oscillator.

=== Examples ===
An example of the discrete case is a quantum system that can be in two possible states, e.g. the polarization of a photon. When the polarization is measured, it could be the horizontal state formula_23 or the vertical state formula_24. Until its polarization is measured the photon can be in a superposition of both these states, so its state formula_25 could be written as

:formula_26,

with formula_27 and formula_28 the probability amplitudes for the states formula_23 and formula_24 respectively. When the photon&#x27;s polarization is measured, the resulting state is either horizontal or vertical. But in a random experiment, the probability of being horizontally polarized is formula_31, and the probability of being vertically polarized is formula_32.

Hence, a photon in a state formula_33 would have a probability of formula_34 to come out horizontally polarized, and a probability of formula_35 to come out vertically polarized when an ensemble of measurements are made. The order of such results, is, however, completely random.

Another example is quantum spin. If a spin-measuring apparatus is pointing along the z-axis and is therefore able to measure the z-component of the spin (formula_36), the following must be true for the measurement of spin &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;:
:formula_37
:formula_38
If one assumes that system is prepared, so that +1 is registered in formula_39 and then the apparatus is rotated to measure formula_36, the following holds:
:formula_41
The probability amplitude of measuring spin up is given by formula_42, since the system had the initial state formula_43. The probability of measuring formula_44 is given by
:formula_45
Which agrees with experiment.

==Normalization==

In the example above, the measurement must give either or , so the total probability of measuring or must be 1. This leads to a constraint that ; more generally the sum of the squared moduli of the probability amplitudes of all the possible states is equal to one. If to understand &quot;all the possible states&quot; as an orthonormal basis, that makes sense in the discrete case, then this condition is the same as the norm-1 condition explained above.

One can always divide any non-zero element of a Hilbert space by its norm and obtain a &quot;normalized&quot; state vector. Not every wave function belongs to the Hilbert space , though. Wave functions that fulfill this constraint are called normalizable.

The Schrödinger equation, describing states of quantum particles, has solutions that describe a system and determine precisely how the state changes with time. Suppose a wave function gives a description of the particle (position at a given time ). A wave function is square integrable if 
:formula_46
After normalization the wave function still represents the same state and is therefore equal by definition to
:formula_47
Under the standard Copenhagen interpretation, the normalized wavefunction gives probability amplitudes for the position of the particle. Hence, is a probability density function and the probability that the particle is in the volume at fixed time is given by
:formula_48
The probability density function does not vary with time as the evolution of the wave function is dictated by the Schrödinger equation and is therefore entirely deterministic. This is key to understanding the importance of this interpretation: for a given particle constant mass, initial and potential, the Schrödinger equation fully determines subsequent wavefunctions. The above then gives probabilities of locations of the particle at all subsequent times.

==In the context of the double-slit experiment==

Probability amplitudes have special significance because they act in quantum mechanics as the equivalent of conventional probabilities, with many analogous laws, as described above. For example, in the classic double-slit experiment, electrons are fired randomly at two slits, and the probability distribution of detecting electrons at all parts on a large screen placed behind the slits, is questioned. An intuitive answer is that , where is the probability of that event. This is obvious if one assumes that an electron passes through either slit. When no measurement apparatus that determines through which slit the electrons travel is installed, the observed probability distribution on the screen reflects the interference pattern that is common with light waves. If one assumes the above law to be true, then this pattern cannot be explained. The particles cannot be said to go through either slit and the simple explanation does not work. The correct explanation is, however, by the association of probability amplitudes to each event. The complex amplitudes which represent the electron passing each slit ( and ) follow the law of precisely the form expected: . This is the principle of quantum superposition. The probability, which is the modulus squared of the probability amplitude, then, follows the interference pattern under the requirement that amplitudes are complex:
formula_49
Here, formula_50 and formula_51
are the arguments of and respectively. A purely real formulation has too few dimensions to describe the system&#x27;s state when superposition is taken into account. That is, without the arguments of the amplitudes, we cannot describe the phase-dependent interference. The crucial term formula_52 is called the &quot;interference term&quot;, and this would be missing if we had added the probabilities.

However, one may choose to devise an experiment in which the experimenter observes which slit each electron goes through. Then, due to wavefunction collapse, the interference pattern is not observed on the screen.

One may go further in devising an experiment in which the experimenter gets rid of this &quot;which-path information&quot; by a &quot;quantum eraser&quot;. Then, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, the case A applies again and the interference pattern is restored.

==Conservation of probabilities and the continuity equation==

Intuitively, since a normalised wave function stays normalised while evolving according to the wave equation, there will be a relationship between the change in the probability density of the particle&#x27;s position and the change in the amplitude at these positions.

Define the probability current (or flux) as
:formula_53
measured in units of (probability)/(area × time).

Then the current satisfies the equation
:formula_54
The probability density is formula_55, this equation is exactly the continuity equation, appearing in many situations in physics where we need to describe the local conservation of quantities. The best example is in classical electrodynamics, where corresponds to current density corresponding to electric charge, and the density is the charge-density. The corresponding continuity equation describes the local conservation of charges.

==Composite systems==
For two quantum systems with spaces and and given states and respectively, their combined state can be expressed as a function on , that gives the
product of respective probability measures. In other words, amplitudes of a non-entangled composite state are products of original amplitudes, and respective observables on the systems 1 and 2 behave on these states as independent random variables. This strengthens the probabilistic interpretation explicated above .

==Amplitudes in operators==
The concept of amplitudes is also used in the context of scattering theory, notably in the form of S-matrices. Whereas moduli of vector components squared, for a given vector, give a fixed probability distribution, moduli of matrix elements squared are interpreted as transition probabilities just as in a random process. Like a finite-dimensional unit vector specifies a finite probability distribution, a finite-dimensional unitary matrix specifies transition probabilities between a finite number of states.

The &quot;transitional&quot; interpretation may be applied to s on non-discrete spaces as well.

<text>Palatine German (Standard German: , endonym: ) is a group of Rhine Franconian dialects spoken in the Upper Rhine Valley, roughly in the area between Zweibrücken, Kaiserslautern, Alzey, Worms, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Mannheim, Odenwald, Heidelberg, Speyer, Landau, Wörth am Rhein and the border to Alsace and Lorraine, in France, but also beyond.

The English term &quot;Palatine&quot; refers to the Palatinate region (). Almost all traditional dialects of the Palatinate belong to the Palatine dialect group, but the Palatine speech area also extends to the west and east into neighboring regions (Saarland, Kurpfalz, southern Hesse). The main dialect divisions within Palatine German are (also called ) and (also called ).

The Pennsylvania Dutch language is descended primarily from the Palatine German that was spoken by Palatines who emigrated to North America from the 17th to the 19th centuries and maintained their native language. Danube Swabians in Croatia and Serbia also use many elements of Palatine German.

==Characteristics==

To the northwest, Palatine German is separated from Moselle Franconian by the &quot;das&quot;/&quot;dat&quot;-isogloss (Palatine German uses &quot;das&quot; or similar forms) and the absence of Rhenish pitch accent. To the southeast, it borders on South Franconian, separated by the &quot;Appel&quot;/&quot;Apfel&quot;-line (Palatine German: &quot;Appel&quot;). Within the greater Rhine Franconian dialect area, the traditional defining isoglosses are the northern &quot;fescht&quot;/&quot;fest&quot;-line that separates Palatine German (&quot;fescht&quot;) from the Hessian dialects (&quot;fest&quot;), and the southern &quot;Haus&quot;/&quot;Hus&quot;-line that separates Palatine German (&quot;Haus&quot;) from Lorraine Franconian (&quot;Hus&quot;).

Like other Rhine Franconian dialects, Palatine German has &quot;e&quot;-apocope (i.e. loss of earlier final &quot;-e&quot;), &quot;n&quot;-apocope (i.e. loss of earlier final &quot;n&quot; in the suffix &quot;-en&quot;) and /oː/ for earlier long &quot;a&quot;, e.g. &quot;Strooß&quot;/&quot;Strooße&quot; &#x27;street&#x27;/&#x27;streets&#x27; (cf. Standard German &quot;Straße&quot;/&quot;Straßen&quot;). The major division of Palatine German into and is based on a bundle of distinguishing features, such as:
* lacks the suffix &quot;-en&quot; in the past participle of strong verbs (e.g. &quot;gebroch&quot; &#x27;broken&#x27;, &quot;geschripp&quot; &#x27;written&#x27;). In , the suffix is retained as &quot;-e&quot; (with apocope of &quot;n&quot;, e.g. &quot;gebroche&quot;, &quot;geschriwwe&quot;).
*Loss of medial &quot;g&quot; in in words like &quot;frooe&quot; (cf. Standard German &quot;fragen&quot;). In , it is retained as a voiced velar fricative (&quot;frooche&quot; ).
* &quot;han&quot;/&quot;hun&quot; &#x27;(I) have&#x27; against &quot;hap&quot;/&quot;häp&quot;.

==Samples==

Here are some words in Palatine German with their Standard German equivalents:

This sentence is pronounced in :

In , it would be the following:

In Standard German, the sentence would read:

In English, it means:

&quot;I have already told [it to] him, but he didn&#x27;t believe me.&quot;


 (Standard German)

&quot;Are you hungry too?&quot; (English)

==Grammar==

Grammatically, all Palatine dialects do not use the genitive case, which is replaced by the dative, with or without , and most dialects have no imperfect tense but only the perfect.

== Notable speakers==
* Helmut Kohl (German Chancellor 1982–1998)

* Lorraine Franconian
* Riograndenser Hunsrückisch

<text>The vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) is a medium-sized New World sparrow. The only member of the genus Pooecetes, it is a pale sparrow with brown streaks that breeds across the grasslands of northern North America. It migrates to winter in the southern United States and Mexico.

== Taxonomy ==
The vesper sparrow was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the finches in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla graminea&quot;. He gave the locality as New York. Gmelin based his own description on those for the &quot;grass finch&quot; that had been described by John Latham in 1783 and by Thomas Pennant in 1785. The vesper sparrow is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Pooecetes&quot; that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek ποα (&quot;poa&quot;) meaning &quot;grass&quot; with οικητης (&quot;oikētēs)&quot; meaning &quot;dweller&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;gramineus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;grassy&quot; or &quot;grass-like&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised.
* &quot;P. g. gramineus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – breeds in southeast Canada to east USA
* &quot;P. g. confinis&quot; Baird, SF, 1858 – breeds in southwest Canada and central west USA
* &quot;P. g. affinis&quot; Miller, GS, 1888 – breeds in northwest USA

== Description ==
The vesper sparrow is in overall length and weighs . Adults have light brown upper-parts and light under-parts, both with darker streaking. There are three features that are unique to the vesper sparrow. The first is the presence of a small, white ring surrounding the eyes. The second is the flash of white tail feathers seen during flight. The third is the presence of a chestnut patch on the shoulder. However, this is usually not visible to an observer.

Another notable characteristic is that some vesper sparrows, especially west of the Cascades, tend to have a more pinkish hue. They also do not have a bold eyeline found in some sparrows.

The male sings from a higher perch, such as a shrub or fencepost, which indicates his ownership of the nesting territory. The musical song begins with two pairs of repeated whistled notes and ends in a series of trills, somewhat similar to that of the song sparrow. They have slurred whistles with one lower pitch followed by a second higher pitch. Furthermore, vesper sparrows make use of short descending trills as a part of their song.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Vesper sparrows are primarily found across Canada and most of the northern United States. Unlike some other sparrows in the regions they are found, vesper sparrows are located in lower elevations of grassy areas such as dry grasslands, sagebrush and fields.

Around September, with the onset of fall, vesper sparrows migrate to the eastern United States, the central United States, Mexico and the Gulf Coast. They return during March as spring arrives to the north.

== Behavior ==
Vesper sparrows tend to be more grounded to the shrub area, often taking dust baths and hopping around. These birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects and seeds. Outside the nesting season they often feed in small flocks.

=== Breeding ===
The courtship involves the male sparrow running with his wings raised and occasionally jumping around to sing its song. The cup shaped loose nest is placed on the ground. The clutch of 3–5 eggs, usually 4, is incubated by the female for 12–13 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge after at least 9 days in the nest. Two broods are raised per season.

== Threats to population==
While the species as a whole is not threatened or endangered, it has faced declines in population. Between 1970 and 2014, the population decreased by 30% and currently has an estimated population of around 34 million. The species has a delicate relationship with agricultural land. The loss of farmland due to conversions to more developed regions has created a degree of habitat loss caused by a reduction in space available for nesting. However, the presence of farmland has also damaged the population. Improper cultivator operations including early and frequent harvesting have destroyed nests and eggs. Fallow strips around farmland have also contributed to habitat loss. The reduction in cover can increase exposure to predators.

<text>The 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, more commonly known as Black Hawk Down, was detailed by the U.S. Army and lasted from October 3 to October 4 in 1993.

== October 3, 1993 ==
=== Afternoon ===
13:50 – Task Force Ranger analysts receive intelligence of Salad&#x27;s location.

14:49 – Habr Gidr clan leaders, two principal targets, and the United Nations Corporation are located at a residence in central Mogadishu, Somalia.

15:32 – Official force launch, consisting of 19 aircraft, twelve vehicles, and 160 men.

15:42 – Official assault begins. 1st SFOD-D soldiers hit the target house. Four-Ranger &quot;chalk&quot; &quot;fast-rope&quot; in. A Ranger, Private First Class Todd Blackburn, misses the rope and falls 70 feet to the street.

15:47 – Large crowds of Somalis begin converging on the target area.

15:58 – One of the vehicles, a five-ton truck, is hit and disabled by a rocket propelled grenade.

16:00 – Groups of armed Somalis from the city of Mogadishu begin converging on the target area.

16:02 – Raid targets captured: Assault force reports both clan leaders and about 21 others were in custody. As the force prepares to pull out, three vehicles are detached to rush the wounded Private Blackburn back to the base. SGT Dominick Pilla is killed as these vehicles return to base, becoming the first American fatality.

16:15 – The convoy is delayed and does not move out due to confusion about who is signaling whom. It turned out that &quot;Delta&quot; was waiting for the convoy to originate the signal to them while the convoy was waiting for Delta to initiate the signal to them. The prisoners were eventually loaded after the Delta teams moved the prisoners to the trucks.

16:20 – First helicopter crash: Black Hawk &quot;Super 6-1&quot; is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashed roughly four blocks north of the target building. Delta Force snipers SSG Daniel Busch and SGT Jim Smith, survive the crash and begin to defend the crash site.

16:22 – Crowds of armed Somalis start racing towards the Super 6-1 crash site.

16:26 – A Humvee convoy starts moving. When the prisoners are loaded up, the convoy and ground forces all begin moving towards the crashed helicopter. Black Hawk &quot;Super 6-4&quot;, piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, takes the place of Black Hawk Super 6-1 circling over the city.

16:28 – Search and rescue of Black Hawk Super 6-1: search and rescue team ropes in to assist the crew of the first crashed helicopter. Both pilot and co-pilot were dead. Two of the crew chiefs, Staff Sgt. Ray Dowdy and Staff Sgt. Charlie Warren, were severely wounded.

16:35 – The Convoy made a wrong turn and got lost among the city streets, sustaining heavy casualties by Somali snipers and armed militia.

16:40 – Second helicopter crash: Mike Durant&#x27;s Black Hawk, Super 6–4, is also hit by a Somali rocket propelled grenade, and crashed about a mile from the first crash site. Hostile crowds of Somalians begin moving toward it as well.

16:42 – Two Delta Force snipers, Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart and Master Sergeant Gary Gordon, who had been providing cover fire by air were inserted into the crash site by helicopter at their own request, to help protect the injured Durant and his crew.

16:54 – HMMWV convoy abandons Black Hawk Super 6-1 search. The Lost Convoy, with more than half of its force either wounded or dead, abandons its search for the first downed Black Hawk and begins fighting its way back to the base.

17:03 – Quick Reaction Force convoy (a smaller, emergency convoy) is dispatched from Command and Control in an attempt to rescue the men stranded at Durant&#x27;s crash site. It encounters immediate obstacles.

17:34 – QRF and the Lost Convoy decided to return to base. Both convoys, having sustained heavy casualties, linked up and abandon the efforts to break through to Durant. The remainder of the ground force of Rangers and commandos were converging around the first crash site, sustaining many casualties. Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith is among those shot.

17:40 – Snipers Shughart and Gordon run out of ammunition and are killed when hostile Somalis overrun Durant&#x27;s crash site. Every member of the crew are dead, except for Durant, who suffered a broken leg and injured back. Durant is carried off by militia (He was eventually released to the Red Cross, 11 days later.) During Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia, Durant was the pilot of helicopter &quot;Super Six Four.&quot; It was the second MH-60L of two Black Hawk helicopters to crash during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. His helicopter was hit on the tail by a rocket-propelled grenade. That led to its crash about a mile southwest of the operation&#x27;s target. (Both Gordon and Shughart received the Medal of Honor posthumously for their heroism in this action.)

17:45 – Both convoys return to the base. Ninety-nine men remain trapped and surrounded in the city around the first downed Black Hawk. Corporal Smith is bleeding heavily, medic requests immediate evacuation.

19:08 – Black Hawk Super &quot;6-6&quot; makes a daring re-supply run, dropping water, ammunition and medical supplies to the trapped force. It is badly damaged, cannot land to evacuate Corporal Smith, and limps back to base.

20:27 – Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith dies.

21:00 – Joint Task Force Command requests assistance from other commands. The Rescue Convoy, composed of two companies of 10th Mt. Division troops along with the remainder of Task Force Ranger, Pakistani tanks and Malaysian armored vehicles, is formed at Mogadishu&#x27;s &quot;New Port&quot;, and begins planning the rescue.

23:23 – The rescue convoy moves out, but as it approaches the crash site there is a large explosion which severely damages the convoy and makes the rescue almost impossible. However, a stockpile of rocket-propelled grenades in the city allows them to be used to great effect. A large proportion of the population is affected by power outages due to the Americans&#x27; destroying electrical substations in Mogadishu.

== October 4, 1993 ==
At Midnight 00:00 (24:00), the Rangers are still trapped inside Mogadishu without essential equipment, such as night vision devices.

01:55 — Rescue convoy reaches the trapped Ranger force. A second half of the convoy reaches the site of Durant&#x27;s downed Black Hawk. Durant and his crew are missing.

03:00 — Forces are still struggling to remove the pinned body of Clifton &quot;Elvis&quot; Wolcott, pilot of downed Super Six One.

05:30 — Rangers start moving from the city to the Pakistani Stadium, on foot. Wolcott&#x27;s body is finally recovered. Vehicles roll out of the city. Elements of the Rangers are left to run to a rendez-vous point on National Street, covering the vehicles whilst enduring gunfire during the exfiltration. The road they take is known as the Mogadishu Mile.

06:30 — The force returns to the Pakistani Stadium. 13 Americans are confirmed dead or mortally wounded, 73 injured, and 6 missing in action (5 are later confirmed dead, raising the death toll to 18, and 1 taken prisoner).

<text>A waterbed, water mattress, or flotation mattress is a bed or mattress filled with water. Waterbeds intended for medical therapies appear in various reports through the 19th century. The modern version, invented in San Francisco and patented in 1971, became a popular consumer item in the United States through the 1980s with up to 20% of the market in 1986 and 22% in 1987. By 2013, they accounted for less than 5% of new bed sales.

==Construction==
Waterbeds primarily consist of two types, hard-sided beds and soft-sided beds.

A hard-sided waterbed consists of a water-containing mattress inside a rectangular frame of wood resting on a plywood deck that sits on a platform.

A soft-sided waterbed consists of a water-containing mattress inside of a rectangular frame of sturdy foam, zippered inside a fabric casing, which sits on a platform. It looks like a conventional bed and is designed to fit existing bedroom furniture. The platform usually looks like a conventional foundation or box spring, and sits atop a reinforced metal frame.

Early waterbed mattresses, and many inexpensive modern mattresses, have a single water chamber. When the water mass in these &quot;free flow&quot; mattresses is disturbed, significant wave motion can be felt, and they need time to stabilize after a disturbance. Later models employed wave-reducing methods, including fiber batting. Some models only partially reduce wave motion, while more expensive models almost eliminate wave motion.

Water beds are normally heated. If no heater is used, the water will equalize with the room air temperature (around 70 °F). 
In models with no heater, there are at least several inches of insulation above the water chamber. This partially eliminates the body-contouring benefit of a waterbed, and the ability to control the bed temperature. For these reasons, most waterbeds have temperature control systems. Temperature is controlled via a thermostat and set to personal preference, most commonly around average skin temperature, . A typical heating pad consumes 150–400 watts of power. Depending on insulation, bedding, temperature, use, and other factors, electricity usage may vary significantly.

Waterbeds are usually constructed from soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or similar material. They can be repaired with practically any vinyl repair kit.

== Types of waterbed mattresses ==
*Free flow mattress: Also known as a full wave mattress. It contains only water but no baffles or inserts.
* Semi-waveless mattress: Contains a few fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support.
* Waveless mattress: Contains many layers of fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support. Frequently, the better mattresses contain additional layers in the center third of the mattress called special lumbar support.

==History in 1800s==
A form of waterbed was invented in 1833 by the Scottish physician Neil Arnott. &quot;Dr. Arnott&#x27;s Hydrostatic Bed&quot; was devised to prevent bedsores in patients, and comprised a bath of water with a covering of rubber-impregnated canvas, on which lighter bedding was placed. Arnott did not patent it, permitting anyone to construct a bed to this design.

The use of a waterbed (for the ailing Mrs. Hale) is mentioned in Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s 1855 novel &quot;North and South&quot;.

On May 18, 1863, a proposal for waterbed supplies was posted to newspapers by the USA Medical and Hospital Department, Medical Purveyor&#x27;s Office, Washington D.C. The proposal requested a supplier for &quot;water-beds, India Rubber Rubber Cushions, for air or water&quot;.

In 1871, a waterbed was in use in Elmira, New York, for &quot;invalids&quot;. It was briefly mentioned by Mark Twain in his article &quot;A New Beecher Church&quot;, which was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 23 July 1871. Twain wrote: &quot;In the infirmary will be kept one or two water-beds (for invalids whose pains will not allow them to be on a less yielding substance) and half a dozen reclining invalid-chairs on wheels. The water-beds and invalid-chairs at present belonging to the church are always in demand, and never out of service&quot;.

A newspaper classified want ad in 1877 requested &quot;AN INDIA RUBBER Water-bed. 3 feet by 2 feet, new or second hand. Call immediately at 1,222 Broadway.&quot;

The protagonist Graham is placed on a waterbed in a glass case during his coma of 203 years in the 1898 H. G. Wells novel &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;.

==Heinlein descriptions==
Science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein described therapeutic waterbeds in his novels &quot;Beyond This Horizon&quot; (1942), &quot;Double Star&quot; (1956), and &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961). In 1980 Heinlein recalled in &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;:

Heinlein made no attempt to build his invention, but its first builder, Charles Hall, was denied a patent claim based on Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;prior works&quot;.

Apparently, the initial patent application by Charles Hall for the waterbed was denied as being too broad, as the device itself had been described by Heinlein in several of his novels that had been published more than 25 years prior to Hall trying to make one. Hall was later granted a patent when he modified and specified his design.

==The Hall waterbed==
The modern waterbed was created by Charles Prior Hall in 1968, while he was a design student at San Francisco State University in California. Hall originally wanted to make an innovative chair. His first prototype was a vinyl bag chair with 300 pounds (136 kg) of cornstarch. Ultimately, he abandoned working on a chair, and settled on perfecting a bed.

Hall was granted a patent (#3,585,356) on his waterbed in 1971, which he originally called &quot;liquid support for human bodies.&quot; The same year, he founded Innerspace Environments, a manufacturing and sales company which became the leading retailer of waterbeds in the United States, with 30 owned-and-operated stores. The patent came to trial in 1991 in &quot;Intex v. Hall /wbx&quot;. The patent was upheld in court, and Hall received a $4.8 million judgment for infringement. Hall /wbx received additional royalties from licensing. Some later lawsuits were dismissed because of laches.

In 1987, sales peaked at 22% of the domestic mattress industry. Although the waterbed was initially advertised as offering &quot;undisturbed sleep&quot;, Hall admitted that customers &quot;bought it for the sensual or the sexual part of it&quot;, and the sexually associated advertising was highly effective in the 1970s and early 1980s. Henry Petroski of Duke University said of the waterbed: &quot;Not only was it the cool new gadget, but it emerged during a time when the culture embraced anything different, especially a product that embodied sexual liberation&quot;.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Regarding usage===
The waterbed can be useful and comfortable for some and dangerous for others. The main feature of the waterbed found attractive is its form-fitting, pressure-minimizing nature. Not only is this beneficial to those seeking mere comfort, but the removal of pressure from the spine can provide relief to those with back pain. In addition, the distribution of weight can prevent bedsores among users who are paralyzed or comatose. However, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development warns that the form-fitting nature of the water-bed poses a danger to infants, providing a possibility of asphyxiation.

Another advantage of a waterbed is its easy cleaning. It is impossible for dirt and dead skin particles to penetrate the water mattress, which can then be wiped away periodically with a cloth and vinyl cleaner. The cover over the mattress can be regularly washed—thus virtually eliminating house dust mites in the bed. Dust mites can trigger asthma, eczema, and allergies in people sensitive to them.

===Other factors===
First, since some hard-sided waterbeds are of different sizes from other mattresses, bed sheets are harder to find and come in fewer varieties. Second, moving a waterbed is more difficult than moving a normal bed; the water must be drained and the frame disassembled, then the frame must be reassembled, the mattress refilled with water, and the water heated for a potentially long period to get the new water to the correct temperature. Heating the bed can be costly; a waterbed consumes between 300 and 1,500 kWh/year ($36–180 USD at 12c/kWh, the US national average cost for residential energy), depending on the climate, bed size, and other factors. The energy usage can be decreased by about 60% with the use of a soft-sided waterbed. The ability to heat the bed is lost if there is a power outage, and this can make the bed too cold to sleep on, particularly if the power outage occurs during winter, and/or the room cannot be heated. The water itself can pose challenges when water mattresses occasionally leak. Plastic liners will reduce damage, but emptying, patching, refilling, and reheating the bed (and sleeping elsewhere until all this is completed) can be an inconvenience. Another factor is the weight of a waterbed. Waterbed mattresses, depending on the size, hold about of water, which could bring the weight of the entire bed to over . This weight could pose a risk to the floor the bed is on. Some landlords may not allow a tenant to have a waterbed due to this, especially if it is on a higher floor.

<doc id="429438" wikidata="Q202578" url="?curid=429438" title="First Jewish–Roman War">
<text>The First Jewish–Roman War (66–74 CE), also known as the Great Jewish Revolt, the First Jewish Revolt, the War of Destruction, or the Jewish War, was the first of three major rebellions by the Jews against the Roman Empire. Fought in the province of Judaea, it resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem, other cities and towns, the displacement of its population, the appropriation of land, and the destruction of the Jewish Temple and polity.

Judaea, once independent under the Hasmoneans, fell to Rome in the first century BCE. Initially a client kingdom, it later became a directly ruled province, marked by the rule of oppressive governors, socioeconomic divides, nationalist aspirations, and rising religious and ethnic tensions. In 66 CE, under Nero, unrest flared when a local Greek sacrificed a bird at the entrance of a Caesarea synagogue. Tensions escalated as Governor Gessius Florus looted the temple treasury and massacred Jerusalem&#x27;s residents, sparking an uprising in which rebels seized the Roman garrison while pro-Roman officials fled.

To quell the unrest, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Roman Syria, led an army into Judaea. After initial advances, the Romans were defeated in Beth Horon. In the aftermath, a moderate government was established in Jerusalem, led by former High Priest Ananus ben Ananus. In 67 CE, Roman general Vespasian was sent to suppress the revolt. He invaded the Galilee, capturing the strongholds of Yodfat, Tarichaea, and Gamla. As rebels and refugees fled to Jerusalem, the moderate government was overthrown, and the city descended into infighting between rival insurgent factions led by Simon bar Giora and John of Gischala. After Vespasian subdued most of the province, news of Nero&#x27;s death prompted his departure for Rome to claim the throne. His son, Titus, led the siege of Jerusalem, which fell in the summer of 70 CE, resulting in the destruction of the Temple and the razing of the city. Titus returned to Rome, where he and his father celebrated a triumph in 71. Meanwhile, Legion X Fretensis remained in Judaea to suppress the last pockets of Jewish resistance, culminating in the fall of Masada in 73 or 74 CE.

The war had profound consequences for the Jewish people. Many were killed, displaced, or sold into slavery. The loss of Jerusalem and the Temple led to a reformulation of Jewish political and religious life. In Jewish history, these events mark the transition from the Second Temple period to the Rabbinic period. After the revolt, the sages emerged as leading figures, establishing a rabbinic center in Yavneh, which became a key episode in the development of Rabbinic Judaism. The victory bolstered the newly established Flavian dynasty, which commemorated its triumph through monumental constructions and coinage. The empire also imposed the , a punitive tax on all Jews, and increased its military presence in the region. The Jewish–Roman wars reached their end in the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the last major attempt to restore Jewish independence, which led to even more catastrophic consequences.

==Background==

=== Judaea under the Romans ===

In 63 BCE, the kingdom of Judaea was conquered by the Roman general Pompey, bringing an end to Jewish independence under the Hasmonean dynasty. Pompey&#x27;s invasion intervened in the civil war between Hyrcanus and Aristobolus, who fought for the royal throne after the death of their mother, Queen Salome Alexandra. During his siege of Jerusalem, Pompey entered the Holy of Holies—an act of desecration, as only the High Priest was permitted entry. The Jewish monarchy was abolished, and the Romans instead appointed Hyrcanus to serve exclusively as High Priest. Parts of the kingdom were transferred to Hellenistic cities and incorporated into the province of Syria.

Recognizing the nationalist character of Hasmonean rule, the Romans sought to suppress it by instituting a new, loyal dynasty. In 40 BCE, Antigonus II Mattathias, Aristobolus&#x27; son, briefly regained the throne with Parthian support, but was deposed by in 37 BCE by Herod, who had been appointed &quot;King of the Jews&quot; by the Roman Senate. Herod ruled Judaea as a client kingdom of Rome until his death in 4 BCE. Afterwards, his realm was divided among his sons. Archelaus served as &quot;ethnarch&quot; of Judea, Samaria, and Idumaea, while Herod Antipas governed the Galilee and Perea. Archelaus&#x27; misrule led to his deposition in 6 CE, and the Romans annexed his territories as the province of &quot;&quot;.

In the following decades, Jewish–Roman relations in the province were marked by numerous crises. With the onset of direct Roman rule, the census of Quirinius, instituted by the governor of Syria, triggered an uprising led by Judas of Galilee. Judas led the &quot;fourth philosophy&quot;, a movement that recognized God as the only king and rejected foreign rule. Under Pilate&#x27;s administration (c. 26–36 CE), incidents such as the introduction of military standards into Jerusalem, the diversion of Temple funds for an aqueduct, and a soldier&#x27;s indecent exposure near the Temple provoked unrest and bloodshed. Conflicts escalated during pilgrim festivals, as the influx of worshippers often fueled nationalistic sentiments.

Under Caligula&#x27;s reign (37–41 CE), Roman policy in Judaea underwent a brief disruption. His insistence on the imperial cult intensified anti-Jewish sentiment, leading to violent outbreaks in Alexandria in 38 CE. Tensions escalated following a dispute at Yavneh (Jamnia), where the Jewish community dismantled a pagan altar. In response, Caligula ordered a statue of himself to be placed in the Temple, provoking widespread outrage. A Jewish delegation from Alexandria then attempted to persuade the emperor to abandon his plan. Only his death prevented an open conflict, but the episode deepened Jewish resentment toward Roman rule.

In 41 CE, Herod Agrippa, supported by Emperor Claudius, was able to unify the territories once ruled by his grandfather, Herod. This period saw a brief restoration of Jewish self-governance, with Agrippa acting as a client king. However, after his death in 44 CE, Judaea reverted to direct Roman rule under procurators, with its administrative territory expanded to encompass Judea, Samaria, Idumaea, Galilee and Perea. His son, Agrippa II, ruled Chalcis and held authority over the Temple, including appointing and removing High Priests.

The second provincial era began stably but soon fell into disorder. Around 48 CE, the Romans crucified Jacob and Simon, sons of Judas of Galilee. In the following years, clashes took place between Jews and Samaritans. By the early 50s CE, the Sicarii, a radical faction, used the dense crowds of pilgrim festivals in Jerusalem to carry out targeted assassinations and intimidate the local population. They also targeted landowners in rural areas, destroying their property in an attempt to discourage cooperation with the Romans. Religious fanaticism grew, inspiring figures like Theudas, who sought to part the Jordan but was executed by procurator Fadus, and &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, who led followers toward Jerusalem before being dispersed by Antonius Felix.

In 64 CE, Gessius Florus, a native of Asia Minor, became procurator, securing the position through his wife, a friend of Nero&#x27;s wife. Tacitus regarded him as a poor choice for the role, while Josephus portrays him as a ruthless official who plundered the region and inflicted harsh punishments. His connections to the imperial family afforded him considerable freedom in his governance. The completion of the construction works in the Temple around 64 CE reportedly left many workers unemployed. The deteriorating conditions under Florus led many to flee the region. During Passover, likely the year after Florus&#x27; appointment, Cestius Gallus, the governor of Syria, visited Jerusalem, perhaps to address complaints against Florus, but he took no action to change the procurator&#x27;s policies.

== Causes and motivations ==
The First Jewish–Roman War is regarded by most scholars as a prime example of ancient Jewish nationalism. At its core, the revolt was driven by the pursuit of &quot;freedom&quot;, which entailed removing Roman control and establishing an independent Jewish state. Aspiration for independence grew following the death of Herod and particularly after the establishment of direct imperial rule. This desire was partially fueled by memories of the successful Maccabean revolt against the Seleucids, which fostered the belief that a similar victory over Rome could be achievable. David Goodblatt noted that efforts such as the attempt to liberate Judaea from Roman rule, minting coins inscribed with &quot;Israel&quot;, and using an era of the &quot;freedom of Israel&quot; reflect characteristics comparable to modern national liberation movements.

The harsh suppression of unrest, along with the widespread perception of Roman rule as oppressive, further fueled Jewish discontent. Many Roman officials were corrupt, brutal, or inept, fueling unrest even under competent governors. Florus&#x27; governorship is described by ancient sources as the tipping point that sparked the Jewish revolt. Roman historian Tacitus attributed the war to Roman misgovernance rather than Jewish rebelliousness; he notes that Jews showed restraint under harsh Roman rulers but lost patience due to Florus&#x27; actions. Similarly, Josephus wrote that Florus&#x27; oppressive rule incited the revolt, as the Jews preferred to die in battle rather than endure prolonged suffering under his governance.

The concept of &quot;zeal,&quot; rooted in figures like Phinehas, Elijah, and the Hasmoneans, is often seen as a key driver of the revolt. While only Eleazar ben Simon&#x27;s faction called itself &quot;Zealots,&quot; Martin Hengel argued that this term could be applied similar factions shared its ideology—recognizing God as the sole sovereign and rejecting foreign rule. He traced this view to intensified Torah concepts, such as God&#x27;s kingship, first manifested by Judas of Galilee, founder of the Fourth Philosophy. This ideology resurfaced in the revolt, especially among the Sicarii, led by Judas&#x27;s descendants. Philip Alexander similarly described the Zealots as a coalition of factions, united by a shared form of nationalism and the goal of liberating Israel by force.

Some scholars suggest that apocalyptic beliefs played a role in fueling the revolt, with many rebels envisioning a divinely sanctioned cosmic struggle inspired by prophetic texts, such as the Book of Daniel, which foretold the fall of the fourth imperial power, which people believed was Rome. According to Jonathan Price, these ideas motivated Jews across the country to join the uprising. Tessa Rajak, however, challenged this notion, asserting that there is no evidence to suggest the insurgents were driven by messianic or end-of-days aspirations.

Some Marxist scholars, notably Heinz Kreißig, interpreted the revolt as a class struggle between social strata, though these interpretations have been criticized for prioritizing political theory over historical evidence. Jonathan Price challenges this view, noting minimal evidence for economic issues in first-century Judaea. He notes that rebel leaders showed little consistent class allegiance; while Simon bar Giora targeted wealthy Jews and freed slaves, both he and other leaders drew aristocratic support, while the others lacked any social agenda. Price interprets the burning of debt records as a move to gain popular support rather than an ideological statement. Guy Rogers argues that debt was a routine feature of life during the period and neither served as a primary cause of the uprising nor as a unifying slogan for any rebel factions during the war.

Mutual animosities between the region&#x27;s Jewish population and neighboring Greco-Roman cities are also considered a factor that influenced the revolt. The Roman garrison in the province was predominantly composed of individuals from Hellenistic cities, while provincials from the Greek-speaking eastern provinces were appointed to key administrative roles, further intensifying existing tensions.

Martin Goodman argued that the revolt was driven by the inability of the local ruling elite to address economic pressures and societal discontent. This failure was linked to their lack of legitimacy, as their authority depended on the Herodians and Romans, both of whom were widely despised by much of the population. He argues that elite involvement made Rome view the uprising as a full rebellion and deepened divisions within the rebel state.

== Outbreak of the rebellion ==

In May 66 CE, ethnic violence erupted in Caesarea, when local Jews tried to buy land beside their synagogue from its Greek owner. Despite an offer well above its value, he refused and built workshops blocking synagogue access. When young Jews resisted, Florus backed the Greek. Prominent Jews then paid Florus eight talents to halt construction, but he took the money and left for Sebaste, allowing work to continue. The next day, on Shabbat, a Greek desecrated the synagogue entrance by sacrificing a bird on a chamber pot, sparking violence between the communities. Local cavalry failed to intervene, and Jews who complained to Florus were arrested.

Shortly after, Florus arrived in Jerusalem and seized 17 talents from the Temple treasury, claiming &quot;governmental purposes.&quot; Protests followed, with crowds mocking Florus by passing around a basket to collect alms. After the Sanhedrin refused to surrender the offenders, Florus ordered his troops to sack the Upper Agora, where they whipped, crucified, and killed over 3,600 people, including wealthy Jews, Roman citizens of the equestrian order, who were legally exempt from such punishment. His troops exceeded their orders, covering a larger area, as well as looting and taking prisoners. Berenice, the daughter of Agrippa I who was visiting the city, pleaded for restraint but, according to Josephus, was threatened by legionaries. A second massacre occurred when Jews from the city went to greet two cohorts arriving from Caesarea. Florus&#x27; troops responded to the greeting with silence. When some Jews reacted angrily, the soldiers charged, causing a stampede that killed many as they tried to reach the Antonia Fortress. Florus, attempting to reach the fortress himself, was blocked by the angry population, who also severed access between the Temple and the Antonia by destroying the porticoes between them. Eventually, he fled the city, leaving only one cohort behind as a garrison.King Agrippa II, the Jewish vassal king of Chalcis, hurried from Alexandria to calm the unrest. After receiving updates on the situation, Cestius Gallus, the Roman governor of Syria, sent an emissary to Judaea, who first consulted Agrippa in Yavneh to gain a balanced understanding. The emissary then traveled to Jerusalem with Agrippa, made a sacrifice in the Temple, and examined the aftermath of Florus&#x27; actions, before returning to report that the Jews were loyal to Rome but opposed only to Florus. With Berenice by his side, Agrippa then addressed the people, calling for restraint and urging them not to rebel. He admitted the shortcomings of Roman governance, but stressed that a tiny nation could not stand against an invincible power.

Initially, Agrippa appeared successful in convincing the people of Jerusalem against waging war against Rome. Following his speech, he and his sister Berenice wept, and the crowd declared they were not at war with Rome but with Florus. Agrippa warned that refusing to pay tribute and dismantling the porticoes connecting the Antonia Fortress to the Temple constituted rebellion, urging their restoration and payment of taxes to avoid further accusations. Convinced, the people began rebuilding, and officials collected the 40 talents owed. However, when Agrippa urged them to endure Florus&#x27;s rule until a new governor was appointed, the crowd turned against him. Amid insults and stone-throwing, he and Berenice were forced to flee in disgrace.

Eleazar ben Hanania, the Temple&#x27;s captain and son of former High Priest Ananias, convinced the priests to cease accepting gifts or sacrifices from foreigners. This act ended the practice of offering sacrifices on behalf of Rome and its emperor. According to Josephus, this event marked the foundation of the war against Rome. Around this time, a faction of Sicarii, led by Menahem ben Judah, a descendant of Judas of Galilee, launched a surprise assault on the desert fortress of Masada. They captured the fortress and slaughtered the Roman garrison. The looted weapons were then transported to Jerusalem.

Subsequently, the leaders of Jerusalem, along with the high priests and heads of the Pharisees, failed to dissuade the populace from revolting. They then sought to quell the uprising by requesting that Florus and Agrippa dispatch troops to Jerusalem. In response, Agrippa dispatched 2,000 cavalrymen to Jerusalem recruited from Auranitis, Batanaea, and Trachonitis. These forces, along with the moderates, controlled the Upper City, while the Lower City and the Temple Mount fell under the control of Eleazar ben Hanania&#x27;s followers. After a few days of fighting, the rebels captured the Upper City, forcing the moderates to take refuge in Herod&#x27;s Palace, while others fled or hid. The rebels then set fire to the house of Ananias, the palaces of Agrippa and Berenice, and the public archives, where debt records were kept. This act is often viewed as reflecting the importance of socio-economic elements in the revolt; as by destroying the archives, the rebels sought to gain the support of Jerusalem&#x27;s poor and debtors.

The rebels then captured the Antonia Fortress, seizing artillery and massacring the Roman garrison. With reinforcements from the Sicarii, they captured Herod&#x27;s Palace, then agreed to a ceasefire with the moderates, but refused to make peace with the Roman soldiers. The Romans retreated to the towers of Phasael, Hippicus, and Mariamne, where they held out for eleven more days. During this time, the Sicarii captured and killed Ananias and his brother. Later, in mid-September, when the besieged soldiers surrendered their weapons in exchange for safe passage, the rebels massacred them, sparing only their commander Metilius, who pledged to convert to Judaism and undergo circumcision. after appearing in royal attire, he was killed, and the Sicarii were expelled from Jerusalem. Some of them, including Menahem&#x27;s relative, Eleazar ben Yair, withdrew to Masada.

Meanwhile, ethnic violence spread across Judaea, Syria, and neighboring regions. Around the time of the garrison massacre, according to Josephus, non-Jews in Caesarea carried out an ethnic cleansing, killing about 20,000 Jews. The survivors were arrested by Florus. Hundreds of Jews were reportedly killed in Ascalon and Akko-Ptolemais, while in Tyre, Hippos, and Gadara, many were executed or imprisoned. The Jews of Scythopolis joined their fellow townspeople in defending against Jewish attackers but were asked to stay with their families in a grove outside the town. Three days later, they were betrayed and murdered. Violence soon spread to parts of Syria, and in Damascus, a large number of Jews were executed. News of the massacre prompted Jewish groups to attack nearby villages and cities, especially in the Decapolis, including Philadelphia, Heshbon, Gerasa and Pella. Cedasa, Hippos, Akko-Ptolemais, Gaba, and Caesarea were also targeted. Archaeological evidence from Gerasa and Gadara confirms the destruction of public buildings. Josephus described Sebaste, Ashkelon, Anthedon, and Gaza as destroyed by fire, though his account may be exaggerated.

Violence also broke out in Alexandria, Egypt, when Greeks attacked Jews gathered in an amphitheater, capturing some alive and provoking Jewish retaliation. Roman governor Tiberius Julius Alexander—a Jew who had renounced his faith and ancestral traditions—attempted peaceful mediation, but when it failed, he deployed military forces, killing tens of thousands. Meanwhile, in Judaea, Jewish forces seized the fortresses of Cypros near Jericho and Machaerus in Perea.

== Gallus&#x27; campaign and defeat ==
At this point, Cestius Gallus marched to Judaea with a force from Antioch, including Legio XII Fulminata, 2,000 men from each of Syria&#x27;s three other legions, six infantry cohorts, and four cavalry units. He was joined by two to three legions of vassal troops: 2,000 cavalry and 3,000 archers fromAntiochus IV of Commagene, a similar number of infantry and fewer cavalry from Agrippa II, and 1,000 cavalry with 3,000 infantry from Sohaemus of Emesa. Irregular forces from cities like Berytus, driven by anti-Jewish sentiment, were also recruited.

From his base in Akko-Ptolemais, Gallus launched a campaign against Jewish villages in the Galilee, burning Chabulon and other nearby settlements, before marching to Caesarea. Gallus&#x27; forces captured Jaffa, Jerusalem&#x27;s port, massacring its inhabitants and setting the city ablaze. He also sent a cavalry force to ravage the toparchy of Narbata, near Caesarea. The Romans were welcomed by the residents of Sepphoris, who opposed the revolt. The city&#x27;s inhabitants pledged their allegiance and promised to support the fight against the rebels. From there, Gallus proceeded toward Jerusalem, passing through Antipatris and Lydda and leaving devastation in their wake. Lydda, largely deserted as most of its residents were in Jerusalem for the festival of Sukkot, was destroyed, and those who remained were killed. Continuing his march through Bethoron and Gabaon, Gallus&#x27; army was ambushed by Jewish forces, suffering significant losses. Among the Jewish fighters were Niger the Perean and Simon bar Giora, a native of Gerasa, possibly the son of a proselyte, who later became a major leader of the revolt. They were joined by Monobazus and Candaios, members of the Adiabenian royal family who had converted to Judaism. Agrippa II made a final attempt to negotiate peace with the rebels, but his efforts failed.

In late Tishrei, Gallus advanced towards Jerusalem and encamped on Mount Scopus. His arrival drove the rebels into the inner city and Temple complex. Upon entering the city, Gallus set fire to the Bezetha district and the Timber Market to intimidate the population, then camped in the Upper City. However, for reasons that remain unclear, he lifted the siege and retreated. Josephus, uncertain of the reasons, suggested that Gallus could have captured the city with more determination. Menahem Stern suggested that Gallus, faced with fierce rebel opposition, did not believe he could take the city by force. E. Mary Smallwood proposed that Gallus may have been concerned about the impending winter, the lack of proper siege equipment, the risk of rebel ambushes in the hills, and the possible insincerity of the moderates&#x27; offer to open the gates.Gallus&#x27; retreat from Jerusalem turned into a rout, resulting in the loss of 5,300 infantry and 480 cavalry. At the steep, narrow Bethoron pass, on the same route where the Maccabees had once defeated the Seleucids, the Romans suffered a decisive ambush by Jewish archers positioned on the surrounding cliffs. Some managed to escape under cover of darkness but at the cost of hundreds of men. Suetonius, possibly in error, claimed the Romans lost their legionary eagle. Pursued to Antipatris, they abandoned supplies, including artillery and battering rams, which the rebels seized. Gallus died soon after, possibly by suicide. Scholars compare this defeat to the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, though on a smaller scale, with Fergus Millar noting its rarity as a decisive Roman loss in a provincial uprising.

The unexpected victory shifted the momentum toward the pro-revolt factions. The rebels grew more confident, while moderates and previously undecided individuals were swept up in enthusiasm. Some moderate elites fled to join the Romans, while others remained in the city, aligning themselves with the pro-revolt camp. Around the same time, a pogrom unfolded in Damascus, where the city&#x27;s men, fearing betrayal from wives who had converted to Judaism, confined the Jews to a gymnasium and then, according to Josephus, killed thousands within hours.

== Judean provisional government ==
After Gallus&#x27; defeat, a popular assembly, possibly functioning alongside the Sanhedrin, convened at the Temple and established a provisional government led by the aristocracy. Ananus ben Ananus, a former High Priest, was appointed as one of the government heads and began fortifying the city alongside Joseph ben Gurion. High Priest Joshua ben Gamla seems to have effectively assumed the role of second-in-command in Jerusalem, despite not being formally appointed to an office in the Temple assembly. The new government divided the country into districts, with commanders assigned to each of them. Josephus, then known as , was appointed commander of Galilee and Gaulanitis, while Joseph ben Shimon was given Jericho. John the Essene led the western Judean districts of Jaffa, Lydda, Emmaus, and Thamna. Eleazar ben Ananias and Jesus ben Sappha oversaw Idumaea, with Niger the Perean, a hero of the Gallus campaign, under their command. Menasseh commanded the district of Perea in Transjordan, and John ben Ananias was tasked with Gophna and Acrabetta in northern Judea. The Zealot leader, Eleazar ben Simon, was denied any formal position.

After the Temple meeting, Jerusalem&#x27;s priestly leadership began minting coins, an act that symbolized the rejection of Roman authority and foreign currency while asserting the new Jewish state&#x27;s responsibility for its financial affairs. These coins bore Hebrew inscriptions in the Paleo-Hebrew script featuring slogans such as &quot;Jerusalem the Holy&quot; and &quot;For the Freedom of Zion&quot;, which was altered in the fourth year to &quot;For the Redemption of Zion&quot;. They were dated using a new calendar based on the years of the revolt (years one to five), signifying the dawn of a new era with the emergence of the Jewish state. The silver coins—marking the first instance of silver coinage in Jewish history—defined the currency as the &quot;shekel of Israel&quot;, with &quot;Israel&quot; possibly serving as the name of the state. The coins&#x27; designation as shekels and fractions, such as &quot;half-shekel&quot; or &quot;quarter-shekel&quot;, invoked ancient Jewish sovereignty by reviving the biblical-era weight system. The use of Hebrew inscriptions on the coins was a deliberate choice, with the language serving as a symbol of Jewish nationalism and the assertion of statehood.

Shortly after its establishment, the government ordered the destruction of Herod Antipas&#x27; palace in Tiberias due to its forbidden images, possibly as a demonstration of zeal or to appease city factions. The unfinished Third Wall, protecting Jerusalem&#x27;s vulnerable north, was repaired and completed. The government dispatched envoys beyond the Euphrates, to Jews living in the Parthian Empire, seeking support against Rome. With no regular Jewish army since the Hasmoneans, the government attempted to form a national army but struggled, as the military-aged population had increasingly joined rebel factions. Weapons were obtained from multiple sources; Tacitus writes that &quot;arms were available for all who could bear them&quot;. They seized significant quantities from defeated Roman garrisons, raided fortresses, and stripped weapons from fallen Romans. Additionally, they commissioned weapons from blacksmiths in Jerusalem and may have purchased arms from local manufacturers, including those who supplied the Roman army. Anyway, as Josephus indicates, the provisional government did not genuinely seek the revolt; instead, while pretending to support it, they aimed to restore control over the country and negotiate a settlement with the Romans.

Around Hanukkah, a Jewish force led by Niger the Perean and John the Essene launched an attack on the southern coastal city of Ashkelon. The assault was motivated by the need to eliminate a Roman stronghold that posed a threat, and was further fueled by the long-standing animosity with the city&#x27;s inhabitants. Two assaults on the city were repelled by the Romans, prompting a Jewish retreat. In the Galilee rose a prominent rebel leader named John son of Levi, or John of Gischala, after his hometown of Gush Halav (Gischala in Greek), who was a wealthy cultivator and trader of olive oil, and a cunning figure. Initially opposed to the war, he reportedly changed his stance after his hometown was attacked by the people of Tyre and Gadara. Leading a group of peasants, refugees, and brigands, he became Josephus&#x27; main adversary, although his attempts to displace Josephus were unsuccessful. In the meanwhile, Simon Bar Giora waged a campaign against the wealthy in the northern parts of Judea. Jerusalem&#x27;s leaders later expelled him from the toparchy of Acrabetene, forcing him to flee to Masada. Initially distrusted by the rebels at the fort and restricted to the lower part of its plateau, Simon eventually earned their trust and joined in their raids on nearby villages.

== Vespasian&#x27;s Galilee campaign ==
After Gallus&#x27; defeat, Emperor Nero assigned the command of the war to Vespasian, a former consul and a seasoned and experienced commander. According to Suetonius, the 57-year-old general was chosen &quot;both for his proven energy and because his family and name were not feared due to their obscurity.&quot; Vespasian then traveled overland from Corinth to Syria, gathering an army that included three full legions: the V Macedonica and X Fretensis, both of which had fought in Armenia, with the latter being stationed in Syria. The XV Apollinaris, which had also participated in the Armenian campaign, was marched from its station in Alexandria to Akko-Ptolemais by Titus, Vespasian&#x27;s 27-year-old firstborn son. The Roman forces were bolstered by 23 auxiliary and six of cavalry, likely drawn from Syria. In addition to these, troops were supplied by local rulers: Antiochus IV of Commagene, Agrippa II, and Sohaemus of Emesa each contributed 2,000 infantry archers and 1,000 cavalry, while Malchus II of Nabatea sent 1,000 cavalry and as many as 5,000 infantry.

Vespasian established his initial base of operations in Akko-Ptolemais, arriving there in the early summer of 67 CE. From this location, the Romans launched their offensive against the rebels in the Galilee, a region with a significant Jewish population primarily living in easily fortifiable villages. While Josephus claims that he gathered an army of 100,000 men, this figure is clearly an exaggeration. Nevertheless, the Romans faced a substantial challenge in the region; Unable to confront the Romans directly on the battlefield, the Jews retreated to their cities and villages, compelling the Romans to lay siege in order to suppress the resistance.

The people of Sepphoris–the capital of the Galilee and the second-largest Jewish city in the country after Jerusalem–surrendered to the Romans by meeting Vespasian in Ptolemais and formally pledging their loyalty to Rome. Gabara was captured by the Romans in the first assault, with all males reportedly killed due to animosity towards the Jews and the memory of Gallus&#x27; defeat. The city and surrounding villages were set on fire, and survivors were enslaved.

The Romans then moved to attack Yodfat (Yodefat/Iotapata), a town with an estimated population of 7,000 on the eve of the siege. Around the same time, Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus led a force to destroy the nearby village of Iaphia, where all male inhabitants, excluding infants, were reportedly slain, and the infants and women were sold into slavery. Cerialis, who commanded Legio V Macedonica, was dispatched to fight a large group of Samaritans who had gathered atop Mount Gerizim, the site of their ruined temple, killing many.The town of Yodfat fell after a 47-day siege, which Josephus, who led its defense, documented in great detail. The defenders employed various materials to absorb projectiles and battering ram strikes, and counterattacked the besieging forces with boulders and boiling oil—marking the first recorded use of this tactic. Dozens of arrowheads and ballista stones were discovered at the site. When the Romans finally captured the city, they massacred all those who were found in the open and hunted down the rest in hiding; Josephus estimates 40,000 died, though modern estimates suggest around 2,000 were killed, with 1,200 women and infants captured. Excavations at Yodfat uncovered a cistern containing the remains of approximately twenty people, including men, women, and children, some of whom showed evidence of violent deaths. This finding, alongside scattered remains across the site, suggests that after the Roman destruction, survivors or returning Jews gathered unburied bones and interred them in cisterns and caves.

Josephus records that following the fall of Yodfat, he and 40 others took refuge in a deep pit. When discovered, they resolved to commit suicide by drawing lots. After being left among the final two survivors, Josephus chose to surrender to the Romans rather than take his own life. Soon after, upon meeting Vespasian, Josephus prophesied the general&#x27;s rise to emperor, which led Vespasian to spare his life rather than sending him to Nero. After the fall of Yodfat, Vespasian and Titus took a 20-day respite in Caesarea Philippi (Panias), the capital of Agrippa II.

When military operations resumed, Tiberias, a Jewish-majority city that was part of Agrippa&#x27;s realm, surrendered to the Romans without resistance. The city&#x27;s population, which had been divided into pro-revolt and pro-Roman factions, saw the pro-Roman faction prevail as the Roman army approached. By contrast, Taricheae, a port town north of Tiberias, mounted a fierce defense but was eventually subdued. According to Josephus, the residents of Tarichae did not initially want to fight, but the influx of outsiders to the city became more determined to resist following a decisive defeat outside the walls. After its fall, surviving rebels took to the Sea of Galilee, engaging the Romans in naval skirmishes that resulted in heavy losses for the Jews. Josephus reports that 6,700 were killed in Taricheae, leaving the lake stained red with blood and floating bodies. Afterward, Vespasian separated the local prisoners from the &quot;foreigners&quot; blamed for instigating the revolt; the latter were forced to travel along a guarded route to Tiberias, where, in the city&#x27;s stadium, 1,200 were executed. Six thousand young men were reportedly sent to work on the Corinth Canal in Greece, some were given as a gift to Agrippa II, and 30,400 were sold into slavery.

The Roman campaign then shifted to Gamla, a fortified city on a steep rocky promontory in the southern Golan. Part of Agrippa II&#x27;s realm, the city was initially loyal to Rome, but later switched allegiance and minted its own revolt coins. Josephus, who claimed to have walled the city, had in reality only hastily sealed gaps between existing structures along the city&#x27;s perimeter. Now a prisoner of war rather than a commander, he accompanied the Romans and documented the siege firsthand. Archaeological finds at the site include various pieces of Roman armor, around 100 catapult bolts, roughly 1,600 arrowheads, and close to 2,000 ballista stones. Gamla&#x27;s synagogue was seemingly repurposed during the war into a refuge for displaced individuals, as indicated by the presence of fireplaces, cookpots, and storage jars near its northern wall. These objects were found buried beneath Roman ballista stones. Despite heavy Roman casualties, the city was eventually captured in October 67 after a siege, and was never resettled. According to Josephus, only two women survived the onslaught, with the rest either throwing themselves into ravines or being killed by the Romans.

The Romans also captured the fortress on Mount Tabor. In Gush Halav, a town in Upper Galilee, rebel leader John of Gischala attempted to negotiate a surrender but instead fled with his followers during a brief Shabbat respite granted by Titus. When Titus returned, the city surrendered to the Romans. Another Roman force recaptured Jaffa, putting an end to the rebel activities that had flourished in Judaea&#x27;s coast following Gallus&#x27;s withdrawal. The rebels had engaged in piracy, disrupting connections with other parts of the empire and threatening vital grain supplies. The Romans were aided by a storm that destroyed the rebel fleet.

== Civil war and coup in Jerusalem ==
As the Romans neared the end of their campaign in the Galilee, Jerusalem, swollen by incoming refugees and rebels, descended into a state of turmoil and violence. Opposing the moderate government were the Zealots, a priestly faction devoted to strict religious observance. They continued that the stance of Eleazar ben Hananiah, the priest who had ceased holding sacrifices on behalf of the emperor. Although Eleazar&#x27;s fate remains uncertain, leadership among the Zealots now featured figures like Eleazar ben Simon and Zachariah ben Avkilus. The Zealots sought to overthrow the moderate government and found an ally in John of Gischala, who arrived from the Galilee with his followers, likely in Autumn 67 CE. The Zealots arrested prominent city figures on charges of conspiring with the Romans and subsequently executed them. They also took control of the Temple, abolishing the traditional practice of selecting high priests from aristocratic priestly families. Instead, a new high priest, Phannias ben Samuel, was chosen by lot. According to Josephus, Phannias lacked both a high priestly lineage and knowledge of the position. These actions suggest that the rebels aimed not only to overthrow Roman rule but also to enact a revolutionary transformation of the Jewish polity&#x27;s social and economic structures.

Ananus ben Ananus, leader of the moderates, sought to suppress the Zealots. In a public assembly, he denounced the populace for tolerating earlier atrocities and accused the Zealots of enslaving the city and desecrating the Temple. His speech rallied the people, who urged him to lead them. As he organized a force, the Zealots, learning of the preparations, launched a preemptive attack. The moderates&#x27; superior numbers eventually forced the Zealots to retreat into the Temple&#x27;s inner sanctuary, where they fortified themselves. John of Gischala told the Zealots that Ananus had persuaded the people to surrender the city to Vespasian, and advised them to seek external support. In response, the Zealots summoned upon the Idumeans, who quickly arrived and, with their assistance, entered Jerusalem in early 68 after the Zealots opened the gates under the cover of a storm. The two factions then launched a brutal assault on the city&#x27;s defenders, many of whom were killed in their sleep or overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the attackers. The Idumeans, showing no mercy, slaughtered both defenders and supplicants.

During the winter of 67/68 CE, the rebel factions ruthlessly eliminated their enemies and solidified their power through slaughter, terror, and public trials. Ananus ben Ananus and Joshua ben Gamla were captured, killed, and dishonored, their bodies left unburied in violation of Jewish custom. The distinguished commander Niger the Perean and the moderate leader Joseph ben Gurion were also murdered. The Zealots established special tribunals to prosecute those accused of treason. Most of the Idumaeans, realizing the extent of their wrongs, eventually chose to leave Jerusalem; others stayed and joined Simon&#x27;s ranks. Many Jews fled to the Romans, driven either by personal danger from their ties to the former government or by disillusionment with the revolutionary leaders; others secured their departure by paying a price. Vespasian, upon hearing of the events in Jerusalem from deserters, decided against marching on the city, asserting, according to Josephus, that God was letting the Jews destroy themselves without Roman interference.

During the Passover feast, the Sicarii descended from Masada, raiding the wealthy village of Ein Gedi on the southwestern shore of the Dead Sea. They killed 700 women and children, looted homes, and seized crops before returning to the fortress. Similar raids on nearby villages devastated the region, attracting new recruits to their cause.

== Vespasian&#x27;s campaign in Judea ==
In January 68, the leaders of Gadara in Perea sent a delegation to Vespasian offering to surrender the city. As Vespasian advanced, those opposed to capitulation killed a prominent citizen they blamed for the surrender, then fled, while the remaining citizens dismantled the city walls, allowing the Romans to enter and establish a garrison. Vespasian then returned to Caesarea. Meanwhile, the fugitives attempted to rally support in nearby Bethennabris, but were defeated by Roman forces. The survivors, seeking refuge in Jericho, were massacred near the Jordan River, where over 15,000 were reportedly killed, and many drowned or were captured.

In the spring of 68, Vespasian launched a methodical campaign to subdue towns and villages leading to Jerusalem. He chose to delay the siege of the city, allowing the Jewish factions within to weaken each other further while awaiting the spring harvest to gather necessary supplies. After capturing Antipatris, Vespasian and his army advanced, burning and destroying nearby towns. They reduced the district of Thamna and then moved on to Lydda and Yavneh (Jamnia), which were settled by those who had surrendered. Vespasian then marched to Emmaus, where he established a camp and stationed the Fifth Legion by April 68. From there, he advanced to Bethleptepha, burning the area and parts of Idumaea, before capturing Betabris and Caphartoba, reportedly killing over 10,000 people and taking 1,000 prisoners. Vespasian then returned to Emmaus, passed through Mabartha in Samaria (later Flavia Neapolis), and camped at Corea in May–June 68. Afterward, he advanced to Jericho, where he was met by the Roman force that took Peraea. The survivors of the Peraean campaign had initially fled to Jericho but deserted when the Romans approached, leaving the city empty. A Roman garrison was established in Jericho and at Adida, east of Lydda.

Vespasian visited the Dead Sea, where he conducted an experiment to test the buoyancy of its salt waters by throwing individuals who could not swim into the lake with their hands tied behind their backs. It is believed that around this time, the sectarian community at Qumran, commonly associated with the Essenes, was destroyed. Some members of the Qumran community may have joined the rebels at Masada. Following this, Lucius Annius was sent to Gerasa (likely a textual error for Gezer), where after capturing the city, he executed many young men, enslaved women and children, plundered and burned the homes, and destroyed surrounding villages, slaughtering those who could not escape.

Outside Jerusalem, Simon bar Giora gained strength, extending his influence over Judea and Idumaea. He plundered the wealthy and freed slaves, promising gifts to his followers. His raids in northern Judea led him to turn his forces southward, where he defeated a Zealot army. He then reached a bloody stalemate with an Idumaean force. Simon withdrew to Nain, preparing for an invasion of Idumaea. He encamped in Teqoa and made a failed attempt to capture Herodium. At their camp in Alurus, the Idumaeans sent an officer to assess Simon&#x27;s army, but he betrayed them by exaggerating Simon&#x27;s strength and convincing them to surrender without a fight. When Simon approached, the Idumaean forces scattered before any battle took place. Simon&#x27;s later successes in Idumaea, including the conquest of Hebron, instilled fear in the Zealots, who ambushed him. When they captured Simon&#x27;s wife, he retaliated by taking those found outside of the walls captive and torturing them, threatening to destroy Jerusalem&#x27;s walls unless she was returned. The Zealots complied, and Simon, having secured his wife, took a brief respite from his campaigns.

== Simon enters Jerusalem, and a succession war in Rome ==

While the war in Judea was in progress, great events were occurring in Rome. When the Senate declared Nero an enemy of the people, he fled Rome and committed suicide with the help of a secretary on 9 June 68, sparking a civil war for imperial succession known as the &quot;Year of the Four Emperors&quot;. The newly installed emperor Galba was murdered after being in power for only a few months by supporters of his rival, Otho.

In April 69, John of Gischala&#x27;s rivals opened Jerusalem&#x27;s gates to Simon ben Giora. By this time, the Zealots from the Galilee had plundered the homes of the wealthy, murdered men, and raped women. Following these actions, they reportedly began to adopt the attire and behaviors of women, imitating both their ornaments and their desires, as Josephus notes, engaging in what he describes as &quot;unlawful pleasures&quot;. Those attempting to flee the city from the Zealots were killed by Simon and his followers outside the walls.

Upon entering Jerusalem, Simon gained control of significant portions of the city but failed to dislodge John, who retained control over the Temple compound and its environs. Simon controlled most of Jerusalem, including the Upper City, with his base at the Phasael Tower, much of the Lower City, and the northern sections of the city. His forces grew as the Idumaeans and nobles joined him. The infighting persisted through the summer of 69. The rival factions burned the city&#x27;s food supplies to undermine their opponents, severely depleting resources needed for the impending Roman siege. According to Tacitus, &quot;There were constant battles, treachery and arson among them, and a large store of grain was burnt.&quot; Rabbinic texts similarly reference the destruction of the food stores, with the suggestion that extremists set fire to the supplies in order to compel the people to fight the Romans. Josephus also notes the burning of food stores, but only during the later stages of the infighting. The destruction of these crucial supplies, which could have supported the city for an extended time, inevitably resulted in widespread starvation.

In late June 69, Vespasian moved southeast to subdue the toparchies of Gophna and Acrabetta, before capturing the cities of Bethel and Ephraim, installing Roman garrisons. He then approached Jerusalem&#x27;s walls, killing many and capturing others, marking his closest approach to the city. Meanwhile, Cerialis led a scorched-earth campaign in northern Idumaea, burning Caphethra and capturing Capharabis (Kefar Bish), whose residents surrendered to the Romans with olive branches, thereby sparing the town from destruction. The Romans then took Hebron, slaughtering its inhabitants and destroying the city.

On July 1, 69 CE, Vespasian was proclaimed emperor, first in Egypt, then by the legions in the Levant, and eventually throughout the East. Josephus, who had predicted Vespasian&#x27;s rise to power, was freed from his chains. Military operations in Judaea paused as Vespasian traveled to Alexandria and later to Rome to secure his position. Command of the war was handed by a council at Berytus to Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus. In December 69, Vitellius was dead, and Vespasian was officially recognized as emperor during the winter of 69/70.

== Siege of Jerusalem ==
By the winter of 69/70, Titus returned to Judaea with an army of nearly 50,000 soldiers and established Caesarea as his main base. His forces included V Macedonica, X Fretensis, and XV Apollinaris and XII Fulminata, along with auxiliaries from Egypt and allied vassal kings. Arab contingents, reportedly motivated by long-standing enmity toward the Jews, also joined the campaign. Meanwhile, internal strife persisted in Jerusalem, where factions led by John of Gischala, Simon bar Giora and Eleazar ben Simon waged a three-way civil war. In early Nisan 70, Titus advanced through Samaria, reaching Gophna before camping near Gibeah, just north of Jerusalem. Following the strategies of earlier conquerors, he chose to attack the city from the north-northeast, where it was unprotected by a ravine.

Jerusalem, spanning approximately with a population of around 80,000 but reportedly swelled due to Passover pilgrims and refugees, faced increasing pressure as Roman forces closed in. Factions within the city temporarily united only when the Romans commenced battering the wall. Titus conducted a risky reconnaissance mission, narrowly escaping an ambush, before setting up camps at Mount Scopus and the Mount of Olives. During construction of the latter camp, a joint attack by the Jewish factions surprised the Romans, some of whom were unarmed, but the assault was repelled. Although the factions had reconciled, they still maintained separate leadership structures and areas of control: John defended the Temple Mount and the Ophel, while Simon controlled the residential districts.

On 14 Nisan, with the onset of the week-long Passover festival, the Romans exploited a temporary halt in Jewish attacks to position their siege forces. Meanwhile, John&#x27;s faction infiltrated the Temple&#x27;s inner courtyards, open to the public for the festival, took control, and subdued the Zealots, bringing them under their authority. After fifteen days, the Romans breached the city&#x27;s Third Wall and captured its northern suburbs. They soon managed to breach the Second Wall as well, but the narrow opening allowed only a few soldiers to enter, and they became trapped, suffering heavy losses at the hands of the defenders. A few days later, this area was also taken. The Romans then destroyed the northern section of the city, and began psychological warfare, parading their forces and renewing peace offers through Josephus, who delivered a speech to the city&#x27;s population, but without success. Meanwhile, famine wreaked havoc within the city. The number of starvation casualties among the population was very high, and Josephus even recounts an instance of cannibalism. Many attempted to flee the city, but both the rebels and the Romans showed brutality toward the escapees, torturing and crucifying fugitives. Syrian and Arab auxiliaries reportedly disemboweled refugees in search of swallowed valuables.

By Sivan, the Romans had encircled the city with a circumvallation wall, aiming to cut off supplies and escape routes. Jewish defenders managed to undermine the Roman siege engines targeting the Antonia Fortress by digging tunnels beneath them and setting the supports on fire, causing the engines to collapse. However, the Romans eventually breached the fortress&#x27;s defenses and turned their focus toward the Temple. On 17 Tammuz, the daily Temple sacrifice (&quot;&quot;) ceased. Some members of the priestly and upper classes surrendered and were sent by Titus to Gophna, where, later during the siege, they, along with Josephus, were tasked with persuading fellow Jews to surrender. Jewish fighters burned the porticoes connecting the Temple to the Antonia Fortress to block Roman access, and sought refuge in the Temple&#x27;s courtyards. On the eighth day of the month of Av, Roman forces breached the Temple&#x27;s outer court. Two days later, on the tenth of Av, a Roman soldier threw a burning piece of wood into the Temple, igniting a fire that would eventually consume the entire structure. According to Josephus, the destruction occurred against Titus&#x27; wishes, as he had intended to preserve the Temple, telling his officers that it should remain as a symbol of Roman rule. When the fire started, he reportedly rushed from a nap and signaled for the flames to be extinguished, but his soldiers either did not hear or ignored his orders. However, an account from 4th century historian Sulpicius Severus—possibly based on Tacitus—claims that Titus actually supported the Temple&#x27;s destruction. Additional references in Valerius Flaccus and the Babylonian Talmud, also suggest that Titus ordered the Temple&#x27;s destruction. As the Temple burned, chaos erupted in its courtyards, as mass suicides and indiscriminate killings ensued. Roman forces then systematically demolished the remaining structures on the Temple Mount, placing their standards near the eastern gate as a sign of victory. 

After the Temple&#x27;s destruction, the Romans began systematically razing the city. Titus refused offers from the rebel leaders to evacuate, and ordered the destruction of several districts, including the Acra and the Ophel, followed by the entire Lower City. On the 20th of Av, the Romans launched an assault on the Upper City. The treasures of the Temple, including menorahs, tables, sacred vessels, priestly garments, clothes, and spices, were surrendered to the Romans by captured temple officials. Roman soldiers massacred people in their homes and in the streets, while some Jews fled into underground tunnels, where they either perished or were captured.

According to Josephus, Titus spared only three towers of Herod&#x27;s palace and a section of the city&#x27;s western wall to protect the Roman garrison stationed there, while the rest of Jerusalem was systematically razed to the ground. The archaeological record aligns with this account, showing evidence of widespread destruction and burning throughout Jerusalem dating to 70 CE. Extensive fire damage destroyed the residential buildings of the Upper City and the Ophel. The Pool of Siloam and the city&#x27;s drainage system became clogged with silt and stopped working. At the base of the Temple Mount walls, large stones and rubble, toppled by the Romans during their razing of the temple complex, have been uncovered. Near the southern section of the Western Wall, massive stones from the temple complex were discovered, having been thrown onto the Herodian street running alongside the wall.

After Jerusalem&#x27;s fall, Titus ordered his men to kill only those who engaged in armed resistance, but many old and weak prisoners were killed against his orders. Younger survivors were confined on the Temple Mount, where their fate was determined: rebels and brigands were executed, the tallest and most handsome were reserved for Titus&#x27; triumph in Rome. Prisoners over 17 were sent in chains to Egypt; many were distributed across the empire for execution by the sword or wild animals, and those under 17 were sold into slavery. John of Gischala surrendered and was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Simon Bar Giora, emerging at the site of the destroyed temple dressed in white and purple, was captured by Terentius Rufus and sent to Titus in Caesarea.

Before arriving in Rome for his triumph, Titus embarked on a regional victory tour. In Caesarea Philippi, he staged spectacles featuring war prisoners, including executions by wild animals and gladiatorial combat. He then marked his brother&#x27;s birthday in Caesarea, where 2,500 Jewish captives were killed in similar games. More executions took place during Vespasian&#x27;s birthday celebrations in Berytus. The final phase of the suppression, a mop-up operation to eliminate the remaining Jewish resistance, lasted until 73/74 CE.

== Last strongholds ==
In the spring of 71 CE, Titus departed for Rome, leaving three rebel strongholds still under Jewish control: Herodium and Masada in the Judaean Desert, and Machaerus in Perea. Sextus Lucilius Bassus, the newly appointed legate of Judaea, was tasked with capturing these final centers of resistance. Bassus first seized Herodium, a fort located south of Jerusalem, before crossing the Jordan to capture Machaerus, a heavily fortified hilltop fortress near the Dead Sea. Herodium fell rapidly, with Josephus offering only a brief mention of its surrender. Machaerus was then subjected to a Roman siege, which involved the construction of a circumvallation wall, small siege camps, and an incomplete assault ramp, traces of which still exist today. The rebels capitulated after Eleazar, a young man from a prominent Jewish family who had ventured outside the fort, was captured, stripped, and scourged in full view of the defenders in preparation for crucifixion. This act led the insurgents to send a delegation to negotiate their surrender, securing assurances of safe passage for the Jewish defenders. The non-Jews present at the site, with the exception of a few who managed to escape, were slaughtered by the Romans.

Bassus then pursued rebels led by Judah ben Ari in the forest of Jardes, near the Dead Sea. According to Josephus, some of these rebels had previously fought among the defenders of Jerusalem and Machaerus. Roman cavalry surrounded the forest while infantry advanced, cutting down trees and overpowering the outmatched rebels; according to Josephus, 3,000 were killed. Bassus later died of uncertain causes before completing his campaign. He was succeeded by Lucius Flavius Silva, who was assigned the task of capturing Masada, the last pocket of resistance.

In 72–73 or 73–74 CE, Silva launched the siege of Masada, deploying Legio X Fretensis and auxiliary forces, totaling around 8,000 troops. When Masada&#x27;s defenders refused to surrender, Silva established siege camps and a circumvallation wall around the fortress, along with a siege ramp, features that remain among the best-preserved examples of Roman siegecraft visible today. The siege lasted between two and six months during the winter season. According to Josephus, after the Romans breached the outer wall, the defenders constructed an inner fortification. When it became evident that this wall would also fall, Eleazar ben Yair, the leader of the rebels, delivered a speech advocating for collective suicide. He argued that this act would preserve their freedom, spare them from slavery, and deny their enemies a final victory. Persuaded by his words, the rebels carried out the plan, with each man killing his own family before taking his own life. When the Romans entered the fortress, they found that 960 of the 967 inhabitants had committed suicide. Only two women and five children survived, having concealed themselves in a cistern.

The Roman effort at Masada, deploying vast resources and engineering ingenuity to eliminate a small pocket of resistance in an isolated desert fortress of no strategic importance, may have been intended as a message to those considering rebellion: the Romans would relentlessly pursue and crush rebels, even at great cost, to eradicate any trace of resistance.

Archaeological work at Masada uncovered eleven ostraca (one of which contained the name of Ben Yair, possibly used to determine the order of suicide), twenty-five skeletons of the defenders, and religious structures, including ritual baths and a synagogue. These findings, alongside the remains of the Roman siegecraft, corroborate Josephus&#x27; account of the siege, though the historicity of his narrative regarding the mass suicide remains a subject of scholarly debate.

==Impact on the Jewish people==

=== Destruction and displacement in Judaea ===
The Roman suppression of the revolt had a profound impact on the Jews of Judaea. Many perished due to battles, sieges, and famine, while cities, towns, and villages across the region suffered varying degrees of destruction. During the war, the Jewish capital of Jerusalem—praised by Pliny the Elder in the 70s as &quot;by far the most famous city of the East and not of Judaea only&quot;—was systematically destroyed, with much of its population massacred or enslaved. Both historical accounts and archaeological evidence corroborate this devastation.

Roman historian Tacitus, when describing the siege of Jerusalem, reports &quot;We have heard that the total number of the besieged of every age and both sexes was six hundred thousand.[...] Both men and women showed the same determination; and if they were to be forced to change their home, they feared life more than death&quot;. Josephus claimed that 1.1 million people died during the siege of Jerusalem, including many who were trapped in the city while visiting for Passover. Modern scholars, however, dispute this figure. Seth Schwartz argues it is implausible, estimating the total population of Judaea at around 1 million, with half being Jews, and noting the survival of sizeable Jewish communities in the region after the war. Guy McLean Rogers suggests Josephus inflated the numbers to flatter the Flavians, estimating casualties in Jerusalem at 20,000–30,000. Charles Leslie Murison proposes that the 1.1 million figure might refer to total war casualties rather than just those in Jerusalem, but emphasizes that this remains speculative. However, Josephus&#x27; report of 97,000 captives taken during the war is widely accepted as reliable by scholars. Rogers attributes this reliability to the Roman practice of recording the number of slaves sold after their wars. Schwartz concurs, noting that this indicates a significant portion of the population was either expelled from the country or, at the very least, displaced.

The destruction was uneven across Judaea. Judea proper experienced the most severe devastation, particularly in the Judaean Mountains. In contrast, cities like Lod, Yavneh and their surroundings remained relatively intact. In the Galilee, Tarichaea (likely Magdala) and Gabara were destroyed, but Sepphoris and Tiberias reconciled with the Romans and escaped major harm. Mixed cities saw the elimination of their Jewish populations, and the impact extended into parts of Transjordan.

Moshe David Herr estimates that one-quarter of Judaea&#x27;s Jewish population perished during the revolt. These deaths resulted from Roman battles, internal conflicts, famine, plagues, and massacres by non-Jews in mixed cities. Additionally, Herr estimates that a tenth of the population was captured by the Romans, with many facing harsh treatment, execution, or forced labor. Strong young men were forced into gladiatorial combat in stadiums and circuses across the empire, while others were sent to brothels or sold as slaves, with the majority ending up abroad. Overall, Herr concludes that a third of Judaea&#x27;s Jewish population was effectively erased.

Despite the devastating losses and the destruction of Jerusalem, Jewish life recovered and continued to flourish in Judaea, with Jews remaining a relative majority in the region. The Jewish population regained enough strength to rise in arms against Roman rule once more during the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE. However, the Roman suppression of the uprising proved even more catastrophic, resulting in the widespread destruction and depopulation of Judea proper.

=== Economic and social ramifications ===
The uprising effectively ended the already limited Jewish political and social autonomy under Roman rule. The social ramifications of the war were profound, leading to the complete disappearance or loss of status of entire social strata. The most impacted were the classes closely associated with Jerusalem and the Temple. The aristocratic oligarchy, consisting of the families of the High Priesthood and their affiliates, who wielded significant political, social, and economic influence and amassed great wealth, suffered a total collapse. With the disappearance of the High Priests and the Sanhedrin, a significant leadership vacuum emerged.

The revolt affected Judaea&#x27;s economic and social environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the Jewish world at large. With the influx of pilgrims and wealth from the Roman and Parthian Empires, which concentrated vast wealth in Jerusalem, the Second Temple had developed into a massive economy by the first century, but the destruction of the city and the temple brought this to an end. Additionally, according to Josephus and other scholars, the Romans confiscated and auctioned off all Jewish land or all land held by Jews who had participated in the insurrection. Josephus reports that in 70 CE, the Romans seized Jewish property in Judaea for resale. Scholars believe this confiscation mainly affected supporters of the revolt, many of whom were landowners in Judea proper. The date and balsam groves of Jericho and En Gedi, along with other traditionally &quot;royal lands&quot;, were incorporated into Vespasian&#x27;s personal estate. Hills and plains that had been cultivated were devastated, as soldiers were often ordered to cut down orchards. Josephus recounts that when Jerusalem was under siege, all the trees in the surrounding area were felled, leaving the land desolate and bare. Many survivors were left to work as tenant farmers on land that had been seized by Rome.

Moshe and David Aberbach argued that following the suppression of the revolt, the Jews, &quot;largely deprived of the territorial, social and political bases of their nationalism&quot;, were forced to &quot;base their identity and hopes of survival not on political but on cultural and moral power.&quot; Adrian Hastings argued that following the revolt, the Jews ceased to be a political entity and did not resemble a nation-state for almost two millennia. Despite this, they maintained their national identity through collective memory, religion and sacred texts, even without land or political power, and remained a nation rather than just an ethnic group, eventually leading to the rise of Zionism and the establishment of Israel.

=== Imposition of the Fiscus Judaicus ===

Following the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, the Romans imposed a new tax, the , on all Jews across the Empire. This tax required Jews to pay an annual sum of two drachmas, replacing the half-shekel () previously donated to the Temple. The funds were redirected to the rebuilding and maintenance of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in Rome, which had been destroyed during the civil war of 69 CE. Over time, the tax evolved into a broader levy on Jews, implicitly holding all Jews—whether in Judea or the diaspora—responsible for the revolt, even though most had no role in the conflict.

Under Domitian, the enforcement of the tax became even more severe, as noted by Suetonius. He states that Domitian extended the tax to those who lived as Jews without openly acknowledging it and to those who hid their Jewish background. His successor, Nerva (r. 96–98 CE), reformed the tax system, applying it solely to Jews who observed their ancestral customs. A coin was issued to commemorate the change. Evidence of the is preserved in receipts found in Egypt, with records dating from 70 CE to 116 CE. The tax ceased in Egypt during the Diaspora Revolt, which resulted in widespread suppression and the near-total annihilation of Egyptian Jewry.

=== Establishment of Roman garrisons and colonies ===

Following the revolt, the ruins of Jerusalem were garrisoned by Legio X Fretensis, which remained stationed there for nearly two centuries. Along with the legion, the Roman forces included cavalry and infantry . Only a small number of Jews remained in the area of Jerusalem, while the emperor took control of the land, which was worked by quasi-tenants, and Pliny the Elder referred to the surrounding countryside as the toparchy of Orine. This significant military presence prompted changes in the province&#x27;s administrative structure, necessitating the appointment of a governor () of ex-praetorian rank. Within this new framework, the regions of Judea and Idumaea were designated as a military zone () under the command of officers from Legio X. In the early 2nd century, another legion was transferred to Judaea, increasing the Roman military strength and requiring an ex-consul to oversee the province.

Roman citizens, many of whom were ex-soldiers, established themselves in Judaea. Vespasian also settled 800 Roman veterans in Motza, which became a Roman settlement known as or . Masada remained garrisoned by Roman troops until the early 2nd century CE, leaving behind archaeological evidence, including documents.

Vespasian further solidified Roman control over the province by granting colony status to Caesarea, the provincial capital, renaming it , and settling many veterans there. According to the Byzantine chronicler John Malalas, a large odeon was constructed in the city on the site of a former synagogue, using the spoils of the revolt. The port town of Jaffa, devastated during the war, was refounded, and a new town, Flavia Neapolis, was founded in Samaritis and granted city status.

=== In the diaspora ===
The Jewish revolt had a profound impact on Jewish-Roman relations, leading to the revocation of many privileges. After the revolt, Roman authorities intensified their efforts to quell any potential uprisings in Jewish diaspora communities, targeting individuals deemed as troublemakers in Egypt and Cyrenaica, which had absorbed thousands of refugees and insurgents from Judaea. According to Josephus, a group of Sicarii fled to these regions, where they attempted to incite Jewish rebellion by urging loyalty to God alone as Lord and refused to acknowledge Caesar as &quot;lord&quot; even under torture. In 72 CE, the Jewish temple at Leontopolis—founded two centuries earlier by Onias IV following the loss of his high priesthood in Jerusalem—was closed by the Roman authorities, indicating that Jewish institutions were now seen as potential sources of rebellion. In 73 CE, the Jewish aristocracy in Cyrenaica was slaughtered, and while Vespasian did not directly condone the action, he implicitly endorsed it by treating the Roman governor responsible leniently.

After the fall of Jerusalem, Titus &quot;funded expensive spectacles and used Jewish captives as a display of their own destruction&quot; in southern Syria and Judaea. Later, upon arriving in Antioch in the spring of 71 CE, Titus encountered a crowd demanding the expulsion of Jews from the city. After deliberations, Titus returned and rejected their request, explaining that the Jews&#x27; country had been destroyed and no other place would accept them. The crowd then asked for the removal of the tablets inscribed with the Jews&#x27; rights, but Titus declined once more. John Malalas, a 6th-century Byzantine chronicler, writes that a synagogue in Daphne, near Antioch, was destroyed during the war and replaced by Vespasian with a theater, an inscription of which claimed it was founded &quot;from the spoils of Judaea.&quot; He also describes a gate of cherubs in Antioch, established by Titus from the spoils of the Temple. According to Philostratus&#x27; &quot;Life of Apollonius&quot;, Titus refused to accept a wreath of victory offered by the groups neighboring Judaea, on the grounds that he had only been the instrument of divine wrath.

Samuel Rocca writes that in the wake of the revolt, thousands of Jewish slaves were brought to the Italian Peninsula. A tombstone from Puteoli, near Naples, mentions a captive woman from Jerusalem named Claudia Aster, with the name Aster believed to be derived from Esther. The Roman poet Martial references a Jewish slave of his, described as originating from &quot;Jerusalem destroyed by fire.&quot; Jewish slaves brought to Italy after the war are also evidenced by graffiti in Pompeii and other places in Campania, as well as possibly by Habinnas, a character who may have been Jewish, in Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;. Similar to Josephus, there are records of other Jews bearing the &quot;&quot; &quot;Flavius&quot;, possibly indicating descent from Jews captured during the revolt and subsequently freed. Rome itself experienced a significant influx of Jewish slaves.

Glen Bowersock writes that revolt and the destruction of Jerusalem brought Jews to the Arabian Peninsula, leading to the establishment of settlements in southern Yemen, along the coast of Ḥaḍramawt, and most notably in the northwestern Ḥijāz, particularly in Yathrib (later Medina), where they became prominent representatives of monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia. Jews are also believed to have first settled in Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and Gaul (modern France) during this period.

=== Religious developments ===

The destruction of the Second Temple, which stood at the center of Jewish religious and national life and served as a symbol of God&#x27;s presence, created a profound religious and societal void. This event marked the end of sacrificial rites central to Jewish worship and abruptly terminated the lineage of the High Priesthood. In the aftermath of the revolt, Jewish sectarianism also disappeared. The Sadducees, whose authority was closely tied to the Temple, dissolved as a distinct group due to the loss of their power base, their role in the revolt, the confiscation of land, and the collapse of Jewish self-governance. Similarly, the Essenes, whose communities—such as Qumran—were destroyed and dissolved during the war, also appear to have vanished. In contrast, the Pharisees, who largely opposed the revolt, survived and emerged as the dominant force in reshaping and unifying Judaism. They were succeeded by the rabbis, under whose guidance a transition took place toward a new religious framework that prioritized Torah observance and the performance of good deeds as central tenets. Over the following centuries, the rabbis continued to shape Jewish practice in the absence of the Temple, focusing on the role of the oral tradition as a complement to the written Torah. These efforts saw the compilation of the Mishnah (redacted in the early 3rd century) and later, the two Talmuds, as primary sources of Jewish law and religious guidance.

The synagogue, which had existed for centuries before the Temple&#x27;s destruction, gradually became the focal point of Jewish worship and communal life thereafter. Rabbinic literature describes the synagogue as a &#x27;diminished sanctuary&#x27; (), and emphasizes the belief that the divine presence () resides there, particularly during prayer or study. Over time, prayers, rituals, and customs once performed in the Temple were adapted for synagogue use. Traditional forms of synagogal worship, including sermons and the reading of scripture, were preserved, while new forms of worship, such as (liturgical poetry) and organized prayer, developed. Rabbinic instruction, however, maintained that certain practices should remain exclusive to the Temple. The Mishnah instructed that prayers be directed towards Jerusalem, and most synagogues face the site of the Temple rather than mirroring its orientation. This reflects the idea that synagogues were not intended to be replicas of the Temple but rather distant extensions of its sanctity.

The destruction of the Second Temple is commemorated on Tisha B&#x27;Av, a major fast day in Judaism that marks the destruction of Jerusalem in 586/587 BCE and 70 CE, alongside other tragedies in Jewish history. The Western Wall, a remnant of the Second Temple, is as a symbol of mourning, earning the name &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; due to the lamentations of Jews at the site. The structure symbolizes the memory of the homeland&#x27;s destruction and the hope for its restoration.

==== Immediate responses to the destruction ====
Tannaitic literature from the generations following the destruction reflects deep sorrow and anguish over the destruction of the Temple. One passage in the Mishnah laments that with the destruction, &quot;faithful men came to an end&quot;, and since that time, &quot;there has been no day without its curse.&quot; According to rabbinic texts, some Jews mourned the loss by abstaining from meat and wine, while others retreated to caves, engaging in fasting and ascetic practices as they awaited deliverance. Certain communities adopted the year of the Temple&#x27;s destruction as a reference point for life events; for instance, Jewish tombstones from the Zoara cemetery uniformly calculate dates from this event. Josephus interpreted the destruction of the Temple as a sign that God had turned to the Romans due to Jewish sin, urging submission to Roman rule. However, he believed that the covenant between God and Israel remained valid, with restoration dependent on Jewish repentance, mirroring biblical interpretations of the First Temple&#x27;s destruction.

After the revolt, Jewish apocalyptic literature saw a revival, with works like &quot;Apocalypse of Baruch and&quot; &quot;Fourth Ezra&quot; mourning the Temple&#x27;s destruction, offering explanations, and expressing hope for Jerusalem’s restoration. These late first-century CE pseudepigraphical texts, attributed to Baruch ben Neriah and Ezra, frame the fall of the Second Temple within that of the First. Both depict the destruction as divinely decreed and executed, interpreting it as a providential sign of the approaching end of time, in fulfillment of God&#x27;s hidden plan. Drawing from the biblical precedent of Jerusalem&#x27;s rebuilding seventy years after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s destruction, they prophesy Rome&#x27;s fall and Jerusalem&#x27;s restoration. &quot;Fourth Ezra&quot; affirms the covenant&#x27;s continued validity, while &quot;Apocalypse of Baruch&quot; emphasizes that the Jews still possess the Torah.

Further evidence of Jewish responses to the destruction of Jerusalem is found in the &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot;, a compilation of prophecies attributed to Greek prophetesses but authored by Jewish and later Christian writers to express their views to the Greco-Roman world through a respected and authoritative voice. Book 4 of the &quot;Oracles&quot;, likely composed by a Jewish author probably after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, references the destruction alongside the Roman civil war of 68–69 CE. It foretells that &quot;a leader of Rome will come to Syria, who will burn the Temple of Jerusalem with fire, slaughter many men, and destroy the great land of the Jews with its broad roads&quot; and prophesies the return of Nero—widely believed at the time to have fled to the East, rather than committed suicide—as an instrument of divine wrath against the Romans in general and the Flavians more specifically. The destruction may have contributed to the separation of Christianity from Judaism, possibly prompting early Christians to distance themselves from Jews. The Gospels, followed by later Patristic writings, depict the Jews&#x27; suffering and the destruction of the Temple as divine retribution for their rejection of Jesus. According to 4th-century church fathers Eusebius and Epiphanius of Salamis, Jerusalem&#x27;s Christians fled to Pella before the war.

The rabbis&#x27; response to the events is expressed through tales, traditions, exegetical writings, and other genres, which were integrated into rabbinic literature over several centuries. These texts attribute the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple to divine punishment for Israel&#x27;s sins as well as societal and social failings. Works such as the Babylonian Talmud emphasize a lack of strong leadership, internal divisions, the misuse of wealth, and a lack of communal care as leading factors for the calamity. One text explains that while the First Temple was destroyed due to idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed, the Second Temple fell because of the equally grave issue of groundless hatred. Another notable text, the story of Kamsa and Bar Kamsa, recounts a banquet where the host mistakenly invites Bar Kamsa instead of Kamsa. When Bar Kamsa is dishonored by being denied a seat, he becomes an informer to the Romans, setting off a chain of events that leads to the war. In another story, after learning that the rabbis had attempted to negotiate a settlement with the Romans, the revolutionary leaders in Jerusalem destroyed the food supplies that three wealthy men—Ben Kalba&#x27; Sabua&#x27;, Naqdimon ben Gurion, and Ben Sisit Hakkeset—had gathered, allowing to sustain the city for 21 years. Rabbinic texts also reference visits to the ruined city, and depict God, along with Moses, the patriarchs, prophets, and angelic figures, mourning the destruction.

==== Establishment of the rabbinic center in Yavneh ====
According to rabbinic sources,&#x27; Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai (&quot;), a prominent Pharisaic sage, was smuggled out of besieged Jerusalem in a coffin by his students. After predicting Vespasian&#x27;s rise to the throne, he secured permission from the future emperor to establish a rabbinic center in Yavneh. Notably, this account shares similarities with Josephus&#x27; narrative of his own meeting with Vespasian, despite some differences. While the details remain difficult to verify, and since the existing sources differ regarding his conversation with Vespasian and his requests from him, various explanations have been offered for how ben Zakkai arrived in Yavneh and established it as the new center of Jewish spirituality.&#x27; Josephus&#x27; writings confirm that several dignitaries fled Jerusalem during the siege, lending plausibility to Ben Zakkai&#x27;s escape.

In Yavneh, an organized and authoritative system of rabbinic scholarship began to form, becoming the basis for the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism as the dominant form of Judaism in the following centuries. Under Ben Zakkai and his successor Gamaliel II, various enactments (&#x27;) were issued to adapt Jewish life to the new reality. These measures included adapting Temple-related practices for observance outside the Temple. For example, the &#x27; of taking the &#x27; was extended to all seven days of Sukkot everywhere, previously observed only in the Temple. He also permitted the &#x27; to be sounded in any courtyard when the New Year coincided with Shabbat, rather than restricting it to the Temple courts as had been the practice previously. Gamaliel sought to maintain ties with the diaspora by visiting communities abroad and welcoming visitors to Yavneh for study and consultation. Additionally, the prayer liturgy was formalized, including the &quot;, which was established to be recited three times daily as a substitute for the sacrificial offerings.

=== Later Jewish–Roman relations ===

Despite the Jewish defeat, tensions continued to build in the region. In 115 CE, large-scale Jewish uprisings, known as the Diaspora Revolt, erupted across several eastern provinces, including Cyprus, Egypt, Libya, and Mesopotamia, with limited activity in Judaea. The causes can be attributed to the destruction of the Temple and the Jewish Tax. Refugees and traders from Judaea—including Sicarii who fled to Egypt and Cyrenaica—are believed to have spread the ideas rooted in the first revolt, as evidenced by the discovery of coinage from that revolt in these regions. The uprisings were marked by extreme violence and took two years for the Romans to suppress, resulting in the near-total ethnic cleansing of Jewish communities in Cyprus, Egypt, and Libya.

Sixty years after the First Jewish Revolt, the Jews of Judaea mounted their last large-scale organized effort to reclaim independence from Rome—the Bar Kokhba revolt. It erupted in 132 CE in response to the establishment of a Roman colony, Aelia Capitolina, on Jerusalem&#x27;s ruins. Under the leadership of Simeon Bar Kokhba, the Jews established an short-lived independent state. Hadrian amassed a vast force that descended upon Judaea and crushed the revolt. The consequences were devastating: widespread destruction, mass killings described as genocide, and Judea&#x27;s near-total depopulation, with many Jews sold into slavery and transported abroad. After the fall of Betar in 135 CE, Hadrian imposed harsh anti-Jewish laws to dismantle Jewish nationalism, banning Jews from Jerusalem and renaming Judaea as Syria Palaestina. The failure ended Jewish aspirations for national independence, and sealed the fate of the Jerusalem Temple. Though Hadrian&#x27;s death in 137 eased some persecution, the Jewish population had drastically declined, with the remaining Jewish population largely concentrated in the Galilee, the Golan, and coastal plain cities, with smaller communities along the fringes of Judea proper and a few other areas. From the time of Judah ha-Nasi later in the same century, the Jews reached a pragmatic coexistence with Rome.

== Impact for Rome ==
=== Triumph of 71 CE ===
In summer 71 CE, a year after the capture of Jerusalem, a triumph was held in Rome to mark the victory,—a unique event in Roman history, as it was the only triumph celebrating the subjugation of an existing province&#x27;s population. Josephus&#x27; description of the triumph, found in Book VII of &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, provides the longest and most detailed surviving account of any triumph from the Imperial period. The triumph is estimated to have been witnessed by a crowd of hundreds of thousands. Vespasian and Titus rode in a pair of triumphal chariots, with Domitian following separately beside them. The procession featured numerous treasures and artworks, including purple-dyed tapestries, embroidered rugs, gemstones, sculptures of deities, and adorned animals. The Jewish captives were marched, according to Josephus, &quot;to make a display of their own destruction&quot;. Moving scaffolds, some three or four stories high, displayed golden frames, ivory craftsmanship, and gold tapestries, illustrating scenes of the war such as ruined cities, destroyed fortresses, defeated enemies, and captured generals.

Among the treasures carried in the triumphal procession were the Temple&#x27;s menorah, a golden table, possibly that of the Showbread, and &quot;the law of the Jews&quot;, possibly sacred Jewish texts taken from the Temple. Simon Bar Giora was paraded in the procession, and upon its end on the Capitoline Hill, he was scourged and taken to the Mamertine Prison. There, in accordance with Roman law, he was hanged as a primary leader of the rebels.

=== &quot;Judaea Capta&quot; Coinage ===
The Flavian dynasty issued an extensive series of coins inscribed with the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;Judaea has been conquered&quot;), commemorating the conquest and subjugation of the province. This represented a rare instance of a provincial defeat being prominently celebrated in Roman coinage. Issued over a 10–12-year period, these coins played a central role in Flavian propaganda across the empire. The obverse featured portraits of either Vespasian or, more commonly, Titus, while the reverse depicted symbolic imagery: a mourning woman, representing the Jewish people, seated beneath a date palm, emblematic of the province of Judaea. Variations included depictions of the woman as bound, kneeling, or blindfolded before Nike (or Victoria), the personification of victory. The Caesarea mint appears to have modified the imagery to reduce potential offense to the Jews of Judaea, omitting more provocative motifs such as a half-naked captive.

=== Monumental Constructions ===

Under the Flavians, Rome&#x27;s city center was transformed with monuments commemorating the victory, including two triumphal arches: the Arch of Titus in the Forum, completed after Titus&#x27; death in 81 CE, and another at the Circus Maximus, finished earlier that same year. The first, still standing today, is widely believed to have been constructed by Domitian, Titus&#x27; younger brother and successor. According to its inscription, it was dedicated by the Senate and People of Rome to the divine Vespasian and Titus. Notably, it features two prominent reliefs: one depicting soldiers bearing the Temple spoils and the other showing Titus in a quadriga during his triumph. The second arch stated in its inscription that Titus subdued &quot;the Jewish people and destroyed the city of Jerusalem, a thing either sought in vain by all generals, kings and peoples before him or untried entirely.&quot;

The spoils from Jerusalem&#x27;s Temple, including the menorah and the Table of Shewbread, were displayed in the newly built Temple of Peace, alongside other masterpieces of art. Completed around 75 CE and dedicated to Pax, the Roman goddess of peace, the temple symbolized the restoration of peace throughout the Empire. The revenues from the &quot; were used for the reconstruction of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, which had been destroyed during the civil war. Additionally, the Colosseum, initiated by Vespasian and completed under Titus, was financed &quot; (from the spoils of war), as noted in an inscription, implicitly tying its funding to the Jewish War.

==Sources==
The main primary source for the Jewish revolt is Josephus (37/38–c. 100 CE&quot;&quot;), born , a Jewish historian of priestly descent and a native of Jerusalem. Appointed commander of Galilee in 66 CE, he was responsible for preparing the region for the revolt, before surrendering after the Siege of Yodfat in 67 CE. Escaping a suicide pact, he saved his life by prophesying Vespasian&#x27;s rise to emperor. Held captive for two years, he later gained freedom after Vespasian&#x27;s accession in 69 CE, and accompanied Titus during the siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In 71 CE, he moved to Rome under imperial patronage, received Roman citizenship and the name Flavius Josephus. Granted land, a pension, and sacred books, he spent his later years writing historical works.

Josephus&#x27; first work and primary account of the revolt, &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, completed by 79 CE, chronicles the revolt in seven volumes. Originally in his native language, probably Aramaic, he later rewrote it in Greek with assistance. The first volume covers events in the two centuries preceding the revolt, while the rest detail the war and its aftermath. Claiming to correct biased accounts, Josephus also sought to deter future revolts. His firsthand experience, supplemented by accounts from deserters and Roman records, shaped his narrative. He minimized the collective responsibility of the Jewish people for the revolt, blaming a rebellious minority, corrupt and brutal Roman governors, and divine will. Taking pride in receiving official endorsement from Vespasian and Titus for the accuracy of his writings; he was likely compelled to present his account in a manner that aligned with their messages or, at the very least, did not contradict them. At the same time, his experience as a participant and eyewitness, as well as his knowledge of both Jewish and Roman worlds, renders his account an invaluable historical source.

Josephus&#x27; second major work, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (completed 93/94 CE), traces Jewish history from creation to the revolt. While it overlaps with &quot;The Jewish War&quot; in covering the period from 175 BCE to 66 CE, which serves as the background for the revolt&#x27;s eruption, &quot;Antiquities&quot; offers greater detail on this era,&#x27; differing in several respects, including its greater emphasis on internal Jewish conflicts rather than on Jewish–Roman relations.&#x27; Josephus&#x27; later autobiography, &quot;Life&quot;, written as an appendix to &quot;Antiquities&quot;, focuses on his role in the Galilee. It was a rebuttal to Justus of Tiberias&#x27; critical &quot;A History of the Jewish War&quot;, which was published twenty years after the revolt,&#x27; and challenged both Josephus&#x27; earlier narrative and religiosity.&#x27; In &quot;Life&quot;, Josephus provides a detailed account of the events of 66–67 CE, offering a narrative that contrasts with his earlier work, revealing differences in the portrayal of events.

Aside from Josephus, the written sources for the Jewish revolt are limited. Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, written in the early 2nd century CE, offers a detailed Jewish history in Book 5, chapters 1–13, as a prelude to the revolt,&#x27; though his siege account is incomplete.&#x27; Cassius Dio&#x27;s account in Book 66 survives only in epitomes, while Suetonius provides occasional remarks. These sources complement and sometimes contradict Josephus, helping to refine and corroborate his account where its reliability is debated. Rabbinic literature provides insights into the war and the Temple&#x27;s destruction but poses challenges for historians. Primarily legal and theological in nature, these texts were not meant as historical records. Oral transmission shaped many accounts, often embellishing events for religious or ethical purposes. However, some rabbinic descriptions, particularly of the Jerusalem famine, align with external sources, confirming aspects of the historical narrative.

More information on the revolt can be deduced from archaeological, numismatic, and documentary evidence. Archaeological excavations at sites destroyed during the war reveal military tactics, preparations, and the impact of the sieges and battles. Jewish revolt coins reflect rebel ideology, messaging, and aims. Texts such as the documents from Wadi Murabba&#x27;at, featuring dating formulas and phrases similar to revolt coinage, shed light on daily life and legal matters during the uprising.

<text>Altenstadt is a municipality in the district Wetteraukreis, in Hesse, Germany. It is situated in the Nidder valley, approx. 27 kilometers north-east of Frankfurt am Main.

== History ==
Altenstadt was part of the limes, the former border of the Roman Empire, that passes through the town. According to excavations, Altenstadt was a Roman garrison in the first half of the second century.

The first documented mention of Altenstadt took place only in the year 767, which makes Altenstadt the oldest municipality of Upper Hesse.

== Division of the municipality ==
The municipality consists of 8 districts:
== Notable persons ==
Rudolf Ehrmann was born in Altenstadt in 1879. He became Professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin for Inner Medicine and one of the most prominent German Physician of first half of the 20th century. He was a personal general practitioner to Albert Einstein who helped him to emigrate to the USA in 1939. In 1945 he became a US citizen.

One of the inhabitants of Altenstadt was the justice inspector Friedrich Kellner, who alternated his work-week between Laubach and Altenstadt during World War II. Kellner recorded the misdeeds of the Nazis in a ten-volume diary which was on display in 2005 at the George Bush Presidential Library. A Canadian documentary, My Opposition: the Diaries of Friedrich Kellner, was produced in 2006.

The Lutheran missionary Georg Heinrich Schwarz was born in Höchst an der Nidder in 1868. He laboured in the Cape Bedford Mission, North Queensland, Australia, for 55 years. The anniversary of his arrival is still celebrated there each year in September and known as Muni Day.

On 5 September 2019, Stefan Jagsch from the extreme-right NPD was elected the Mayor of the Waldsiedlung unopposed, which led to irritation in other parties at national level.

<text>In electronics, a buffer amplifier is a unity gain amplifier that copies a signal from one circuit to another while transforming its electrical impedance to provide a more ideal source (with a &quot;lower&quot; output impedance for a voltage buffer or a &quot;higher&quot; output impedance for a current buffer). This &quot;buffers&quot; the signal source in the first circuit against being affected by currents from the electrical load of the second circuit and may simply be called a buffer or follower when context is clear.

==Voltage buffer==
A voltage buffer amplifier is used to transform a voltage signal with high output impedance from a first circuit into an identical voltage with low impedance for a second circuit. The interposed buffer amplifier prevents the second circuit from loading the first circuit unacceptably and interfering with its desired operation, since without the voltage buffer, the voltage of the second circuit is influenced by output impedance of the first circuit (as it is larger than the input impedance of the second circuit). In the ideal voltage buffer (Figure 1 top), the input impedance is infinite and the output impedance is zero. Other properties of the ideal buffer are: perfect linearity, regardless of signal amplitudes; and instant output response, regardless of the speed of the input signal.

If the voltage is transferred unchanged (the voltage gain &quot;Av&quot; is 1), the amplifier is a unity gain buffer; also known as a voltage follower because the output voltage &quot;follows&quot; or tracks the input voltage. Although the voltage gain of a voltage buffer amplifier may be (approximately) unity, it usually provides considerable current gain and thus power gain. However, it is commonplace to say that it has a gain of 1 (or the equivalent 0 dB), referring to the voltage gain.

As an example, consider a Thévenin source (voltage &quot;VA&quot;, series resistance &quot;RA&quot;) driving a resistor load &quot;RL&quot;. Because of voltage division (also referred to as &quot;loading&quot;) the voltage across the load is only &quot;&quot;. However, if the Thévenin source drives a unity gain buffer such as that in Figure 1 (top, with unity gain), the voltage input to the amplifier is &quot;VA&quot;, and with &quot;no voltage division&quot; because the amplifier input resistance is infinite. At the output the dependent voltage source delivers voltage &quot;Av VA = VA&quot; to the load, again without voltage division because the output resistance of the buffer is zero. A Thévenin equivalent circuit of the combined original Thévenin source &quot;and&quot; the buffer is an ideal voltage source &quot;VA&quot; with zero Thévenin resistance.

==Current buffer==
Typically a current buffer amplifier is used to transform a current signal with a low output impedance from a first circuit into an identical current with high impedance for a second circuit. The interposed buffer amplifier prevents the second circuit from loading the first circuit&#x27;s current unacceptably and interfering with its desired operation. In the ideal current buffer (Figure 1 bottom), the output impedance is infinite (an ideal current source) and the input impedance is zero (a short circuit). Again, other properties of the ideal buffer are: perfect linearity, regardless of signal amplitudes; and instant output response, regardless of the speed of the input signal.

For a current buffer, if the current is transferred unchanged (the current gain &quot;βi&quot; is 1), the amplifier is again a unity gain buffer; this time known as a current follower because the output current &quot;follows&quot; or tracks the input current.

As an example, consider a Norton source (current &quot;IA&quot;, parallel resistance &quot;RA&quot;) driving a resistor load &quot;RL&quot;. Because of current division (also referred to as &quot;loading&quot;) the current delivered to the load is only &quot;&quot;. However, if the Norton source drives a unity gain buffer such as that in Figure 1 (bottom, with unity gain), the current input to the amplifier is &quot;IA&quot;, with &quot;no current division&quot; because the amplifier input resistance is zero. At the output the dependent current source delivers current &quot;βi IA = IA&quot; to the load, again without current division because the output resistance of the buffer is infinite. A Norton equivalent circuit of the combined original Norton source &quot;and&quot; the buffer is an ideal current source &quot;IA&quot; with infinite Norton resistance.

==Voltage buffer examples==

=== Op-amp implementation ===
A unity gain buffer amplifier may be constructed by applying a full series negative feedback (Fig. 2) to an op-amp simply by connecting its output to its inverting input, and connecting the signal source to the non-inverting input (Fig. 3). Unity gain here implies a &quot;voltage gain&quot; of one (i.e. 0 dB), but significant &quot;current gain&quot; is expected. In this configuration, the entire output voltage (β = 1 in Fig. 2) is fed back into the inverting input. The difference between the non-inverting input voltage and the inverting input voltage is amplified by the op-amp. This connection forces the op-amp to adjust its output voltage to simply equal the input voltage (Vout follows Vin so the circuit is named op-amp voltage follower).

The impedance of this circuit does not come from any change in voltage, but from the input and output impedances of the op-amp. The input impedance of the op-amp is very high (1 MΩ to 10 TΩ), meaning that the input of the op-amp does not load down the source and draws only minimal current from it. Because the output impedance of the op-amp is very low, it drives the load as if it were a perfect voltage source. Both the connections to and from the buffer are therefore bridging connections, which reduce power consumption in the source, distortion from overloading, crosstalk and other electromagnetic interference.

=== Simple transistor circuits ===
Other unity gain buffer amplifiers include the bipolar junction transistor in common-collector configuration (called an &quot;emitter follower&quot; because the emitter voltage follows the base voltage, or a &quot;voltage follower&quot; because the output voltage follows the input voltage); the field effect transistor in common-drain configuration (called a source follower because the source voltage follows the gate voltage or, again, a &quot;voltage follower&quot; because the output voltage follows the input voltage); or similar configurations using vacuum tubes (cathode follower), or other active devices. All such amplifiers actually have a gain of slightly less than unity (though the loss may be small and unimportant) and add a DC offset. Only one transistor is shown as the active device in these schematics (however, the current source these circuits may require transistors too).

====Impedance transformation using the bipolar voltage follower====
Using the small-signal circuit in Figure 4, the impedance seen looking into the circuit is
::formula_1

(The analysis uses the relation &quot;gmrπ = (IC /VT) (VT /IB)&quot; = β, which follows from the evaluation of these parameters in terms of the bias currents.) Assuming the usual case where &quot;rO&quot; » &quot;RL&quot;, the impedance looking into the buffer is larger than the load &quot;RL&quot; without the buffer by a factor of (β + 1), which is substantial because β is large. The impedance is increased even more by the added &quot;rπ&quot;, but often &quot;rπ&quot; « (β + 1) RL, so the addition does not make much difference

====Impedance transformation using the MOSFET voltage follower====
Using the small-signal circuit in Figure 5, the impedance seen looking into the circuit is no longer &quot;RL&quot; but instead is infinite (at low frequencies) because the MOSFET draws no current.

As frequency is increased, the parasitic capacitances of the transistors come into play and the transformed input impedance drops with frequency.

====Chart of single-transistor amplifiers====
Some configurations of single-transistor amplifier can be used as a buffer to isolate the driver from the load. For most digital applications, an NMOS voltage follower (common drain) is the preferred configuration. These amplifiers have high input impedance, which means that the digital system will not need to supply a large current.
==== Logic buffer amplifiers ====

A non-linear buffer amplifier is sometimes used in digital circuits where a high current is required, perhaps for driving more gates than the normal fan-out of the logic family used, or for driving displays, or long wires, or other difficult loads. It is common for a single package to contain several discrete buffer amplifiers. For example, a hex buffer is a single package containing 6 buffer amplifiers, and an octal buffer is a single package containing 8 buffer amplifiers. The terms inverting buffer and non-inverting buffer effectively correspond with high-current capability single-input NOR or OR gates respectively.

==== Speaker array amplifiers ====

The majority of amplifiers used to drive large speaker arrays, such as those used for rock concerts, are amplifiers with 26-36dB voltage gain capable of high amounts of current into low impedance speaker arrays where the speakers are wired in parallel.

==== Driven guards ====
A driven guard utilizes a voltage buffer to protect a very high impedance signal line by surrounding the line with a shield driven by a buffer to the same voltage as the line, the close voltage matching of the buffer prevents the shield from leaking significant current into the high impedance line while the low impedance of the shield can absorb any stray currents that could affect the signal line.

==Current buffer examples==
Simple unity gain buffer amplifiers include the bipolar junction transistor in common-base configuration, or the MOSFET in common-gate configuration (called a &quot;current follower&quot; because the output current follows the input current). The current gain of a current buffer amplifier is (approximately) unity.

=== Simple transistor circuits ===

Figure 6 shows a bipolar current buffer biased with a current source (designated &quot;IE&quot; for DC emitter current) and driving another DC current source as active load (designated &quot;IC&quot; for DC collector current). The AC input signal current &quot;iin&quot; is applied to the emitter node of the transistor by an AC Norton current source with Norton resistance &quot;RS&quot;. The AC output current &quot;iout&quot; is delivered by the buffer via a large coupling capacitor to load &quot;RL&quot;. This coupling capacitor is large enough to be a short circuit at frequencies of interest.

Because the transistor output resistance connects input and output sides of the circuit, there is a (very small) backward voltage feedback from the output to the input so this circuit is not unilateral. In addition, for the same reason, the input resistance depends (slightly) upon the output load resistance, and the output resistance depends significantly on the input driver resistance.

<text>Elcat was a battery electric vehicle manufacturer and an electric vehicle importer based in Järvenpää, Finland.

Elcat Automotive was owned by an electricity producer called Fortum until the production decreased in the early 21st century. Elcat began working in 1974 to design electric cars for Nordic climate. The first prototypes for Elcat&#x27;s automotive industry were made in 1985 with a joint venture plan with Subaru&#x27;s Sambar, Dias, and Domingo vans, while the first commercial product was released in 1990. The users of Elcat vehicles were Finnish post office (Posti) and Stockholm-based delivery service.

Elcat ceased car production in 2002 and pivoted to importing electric vehicles. The company imported and sold electric quadricycles, golf carts, and maintenance vehicles as well as electric mopeds and bicycles.

Elcat went bankrupt in 2017.

<text>The field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) is a small New World sparrow in the family Passerellidae. It is about long and weighs about . The head is grey with a rust-coloured crown, white eye-ring and pink bill. The upper parts are brown streaked with black and buff, the breast is buff, the belly is white and the tail is forked. There are two different colour morphs, one being greyer and the other more rufous.

The field sparrow is distributed across eastern Canada and the eastern United States, with northern populations migrating southwards to southern United States and north-eastern Mexico in the fall. The typical habitat of this bird is bushy country with shrubs and grassland. The nest is a cup-shaped construction built on the ground and hidden beneath a bush or clump of grass. The birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, feeding mainly on seeds and insects. The population is thought to be in slow decline, but it is a common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Description==
Adults have brown upperparts, a buffy breast, a white belly, two whitish wing bars and a dark-brown forked tail. They have a grey face, a rusty crown, a white eye ring and a pink bill. They have rusty markings behind the eye. There are grey and rufous colour variants of the species. Males and females have a similar appearance with males being slightly larger than the females.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is brushy, shrubby fields across eastern North America. The nest is an open cup on the ground under a clump of grass or in a small thicket. They often breed more than once in each season, and each time they build a new nest, the nest is built higher off the ground as the season progresses and leaves grow in..Their eggs are laid in May or June; they are pale bluish white, speckled and blotched with yellowish brown and grayish purple.

These birds are permanent residents in the southern parts of their range. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico.

==Habits==
These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, mainly eating insects and seeds. They may feed in small flocks outside the nesting season.

The male sings from a higher perch, such as a shrub or fencepost, which indicates his ownership of the nesting territory. The song is a series of sad whistles ending in a trill, the sound formed like the accelerating sound of a bouncing ball has the quality coming to rest, usually last a long 4 seconds, both are often compared.

This bird&#x27;s numbers expanded as settlers cleared forests in eastern North America, but may have declined in more recent times. Despite this, it is a common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>The Department of State Security (), commonly known as the Securitate (, ), was the secret police agency of the Socialist Republic of Romania. It was founded on 30 August 1948 from the &quot;Siguranța&quot; with help and direction from the Soviet MGB. 

The Securitate was, in proportion to Romania&#x27;s population, one of the largest secret police forces in the Eastern bloc. The first budget of the Securitate in 1948 stipulated a number of 4,641 positions, of which 3,549 were filled by February 1949: 64% were workers, 4% peasants, 28% clerks, 2% persons of unspecified origin, and 2% intellectuals. By 1951, the Securitate&#x27;s staff had increased fivefold, while in January 1956, the Securitate had 25,468 employees. At its height, the Securitate employed some 11,000 agents and had half a million informers for a country with a population of 22 million by 1985. The Securitate under Nicolae Ceaușescu was one of the most brutal secret police forces in the world, responsible for the arrests, torture, and deaths of thousands of people. Following the Romanian Revolution in 1989, the new authorities assigned the various intelligence tasks of the Securitate to new institutions.

==History==

===Founding===

The General Directorate for the Security of the People (Romanian initials: DGSP, but more commonly just called the Securitate) was officially founded on 30 August 1948, by Decree 221/30 of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly. However, it had precursors going back to August 1944, following the coup d&#x27;état of 23 August. Its stated purpose was to &quot;defend democratic conquests and guarantee the safety of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic against both internal and external enemies.&quot;

The Securitate was created with the help of SMERSH, the NKVD counter-intelligence unit. The SMERSH operation in Romania, called Brigada Mobilă (&quot;The Mobile Brigade&quot;), was led until 1948 by NKVD colonel Alexandru Nicolschi. The first Director of the Securitate was NKVD general Gheorghe Pintilie (born &quot;Panteleymon Bodnarenko&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Pantiușa&quot;). Alexandru Nicolschi (by then a general) and another Soviet officer, Major General , held the deputy directorships. was the first Securitate secretary.

As Vladimir Tismăneanu says, &quot;If one does not grasp the role of political thugs such as the Soviet spies Pintilie Bodnarenko (Pantiușa) and Alexandru Nikolski in the exercise of terror in Romania during the most horrible Stalinist period, and their personal connections with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and members of his entourage, it is difficult to understand the origins and the role of the Securitate&quot;.

Initially, many of the agents of the Securitate were former Royal Security Police (named &quot;General Directorate of Safety Police&quot;—&quot;Direcția Generală a Poliției de Siguranță&quot; in Romanian) members. However, before long, Pantiușa ordered anyone who had served the monarchy&#x27;s police in any capacity arrested, and in the places of the Royal Security Policemen, he hired ardent members of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), to ensure total loyalty within the organization.

Several Securitate operatives were killed in action, especially in the early 1950s. As listed by the internal news bulletin on the occasion of Securitate&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, in 1968, these included major Constantin Vieru, senior lieutenant Ștefan Vămanu, lieutenant Iosif Sipoș, sub-lieutenant Vasile Costan, platoon leader Constantin Apăvăloaie and corporal Alexandru Belate. Furthermore, lieutenant Ionel Jora was killed by the son of a suspect he had apprehended.

===Method===

The Securitate surveillance took place in different ways: general intelligence surveillance (&quot;supraveghere informativă generală&quot;, abbreviated &quot;S.I.G.&quot;); priority intelligence surveillance (&quot;supraveghere informativă prioritară&quot;, abbreviated &quot;S.I.P.&quot;); clearance file (&quot;mapă de verificare&quot;, abbreviated &quot;M.V.&quot;); individual surveillance dossier (&quot;dosar de urmărire individuală&quot;, abbreviated &quot;D.U.I.&quot;); target dossier (&quot;dosar de obiectiv&quot;), the target being, for example, an institute, a hospital, a school, or a company; case dossier (&quot;dosar de problemă&quot;), the targets being former political prisoners, former Iron Guard members, religious organizations, etc.; and element dossier (&quot;dosar de mediu&quot;), targeting writers, priests, etc.

In the 1980s, the Securitate launched a massive campaign to stamp out dissent in Romania, manipulating the country&#x27;s population with vicious rumors (such as supposed contacts with Western intelligence agencies), machinations, frameups, public denunciations, encouraging conflict between segments of the population, public humiliation of dissidents, toughened censorship and the repression of even the smallest gestures of independence by intellectuals. Often the term &quot;intellectual&quot; was used by the Securitate to describe dissidents who had higher education qualifications, such as college and university students, writers, directors, and scientists, who opposed the philosophy of the Romanian Communist Party. Assassinations were also used to silence dissent, such as the attempt to kill high-ranking defector Ion Mihai Pacepa, who received two death sentences from Romania in 1978, and on whose head Ceaușescu decreed a bounty of two million US dollars. Yasser Arafat and Muammar al-Gaddafi each added one more million dollars to the reward. In the 1980s, Securitate officials allegedly hired Carlos the Jackal to assassinate Pacepa.

Forced entry into homes and offices and the planting of microphones was another tactic the Securitate used to extract information from the general population. Telephone conversations were routinely monitored, and all internal and international fax and telex communications were intercepted. In August 1977, when the Jiu Valley coal miners&#x27; unions went on strike, several leaders died prematurely, and it was later discovered that Securitate doctors had subjected them to five-minute chest X-rays in an attempt to have them develop cancer. After birth rates fell, Securitate agents were placed in gynecological wards while regular pregnancy tests were made mandatory for women of child-bearing age, with severe penalties for anyone who was found to have terminated a pregnancy.

The Securitate&#x27;s presence was so ubiquitous that it was believed one out of four Romanians was an informer. In truth, the Securitate deployed one agent or informer for every 43 Romanians, which was still a high enough proportion to make it practically impossible for dissidents to organize. The regime deliberately fostered this sense of ubiquity, believing that the fear of being watched was sufficient to bend the people to Ceaușescu&#x27;s will. For example, one shadow group of dissidents limited itself to only three families; any more than that would have attracted Securitate attention. In truth, the East German Stasi was even more ubiquitous than the Securitate; counting informers, the Stasi had one spy for every 6.5 East Germans. 

During the period 1980–1989, the Securitate recruited over 200,000 informants, the largest number in its history, and about a third of the estimated number of 650,000 collaborators dating back to 1948; in 1989 alone, more than 25,000 recruitments were carried out. According to data, of those 200,000 new recruits, 158,000 were men. About 30,200 had higher education and more than 4,300 were students. Most collaborators came from the education area, approximately 8,500, and in second place were members of the clergy, almost 4,200. More than 3,600 doctors and nurses were informants, and 800 came from the legal professions. In the arts sector, over 1,000 recruits included 110 actors, 50 directors, 120 artists, 410 instrumentalists, 210 painters, and 55 sculptors. Less than 5% of the number of new informants (about 8,500) came from rural areas.

===Downfall===
After Ceaușescu was ousted, the new authorities replaced the Securitate with a few special and secret services like the SRI (Romanian Intelligence Service) (with internal tasks such as counterespionage), the SIE (Foreign Intelligence Service), the SPP (Protection and Guard Service) (the former Directorate V), the STS (Special Telecommunications Service) (the former General Directorate for Technical Operations), etc.

Today, the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives (abbreviated CNSAS, for Consiliul Național pentru Studierea Arhivelor Securității) &quot;is the authority that administrates the archives of the former communist secret services in Romania and develops educational programs and exhibitions with the aim of preserving the memories of victims of the communist regime.&quot;

==Subdivisions==
===General Directorate for Technical Operations===
The General Directorate for Technical Operations (Direcția Generală de Tehnică Operativă — DGTO) was an integral part of the Securitate&#x27; s activities. Established with the assistance of the KGB in the mid-1950s, the DGTO monitored all voice and electronic communications in the country. The DGTO intercepted all telephone, telegraph, and telex communications coming into and going out of the country. It secretly implanted microphones in public buildings and private residences to record ordinary conversations among citizens.

===Directorate for Counterespionage===
The Directorate for Counterespionage conducted surveillance against foreigners—Soviet nationals in particular—to monitor or impede their contacts with Romanians. It enforced a variety of restrictions preventing foreigners from residing with ordinary citizens, keeping them from gaining access to foreign embassy compounds and requesting asylum, and requiring them to report any contact with foreigners to the Securitate within twenty-four hours. Directorate IV was responsible for similar counterespionage functions within the armed forces, and its primary mission was identifying and neutralizing Soviet penetrations.

===Directorate for Foreign Intelligence===
The Directorate for Foreign Intelligence conducted Romania&#x27;s espionage operations in other countries, such as those of Western Europe. Among those operations sanctioned by the Communist government were industrial espionage to obtain nuclear technology, and plots to assassinate dissidents, such as Matei Pavel Haiducu was tasked with, though he informed French authorities, faking the assassinations before defecting to France.

===Directorate for Penitentiaries===
The Directorate for Penitentiaries operated Romania&#x27;s prisons, which were notorious for their horrendous conditions. Prisoners were routinely beaten, denied medical attention, had their mail taken away from them, and sometimes even administered lethal doses of poison. Some of the harshest prisons were those at Aiud, Gherla, Pitești, Râmnicu Sarat, and Sighet, as well as the forced labor camps along the Danube–Black Sea Canal and at Periprava. From 1948 to 1955, the penitentiaries operated by this Directorate were grouped into 4 categories:
* Category I: Aiud, Gherla, Jilava.
* Category II: Arad, Caransebeș, Cluj, Constanța, Craiova, Făgăraș, Galați, Mărgineni, Mislea, Ocnele Mari, Oradea, Brașov, Pitești, Ploiești, Rahova, Suceava, Târgșor, Târgu Ocna, Timișoara, Văcărești.
* Category III: Alba Iulia, Bacău, Baia Mare, Botoșani, Brăila, Buzău, Cluj (minors), Dej, Deva, Dumbrăveni, Focșani, Iași, Rahova II, Râmnicu Sarat, Sibiu, Satu Mare, Sighet, Târgu Mureș.
* Category IV: Bârlad, Bistrița, Caracal, Carei, Călărași, Câmpulung Moldovenesc, Câmpulung Muscel, Codlea, Dăeni, Giurgiu, Făgăraș (local), Fălticeni, Dorohoi, Huși, Ișalnița, Lugoj, Miercurea Ciuc (women), Odorhei, Oravița, Petroșani, Piatra Neamț, Rădăuți, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Roman, Sfântu Gheorghe, Sighișoara, Sighet (local), Slatina, Târgoviște, Târgu Jiu, Tecuci, Tulcea, Turda, Turnu Măgurele, Turnu Severin, Vaslui, Zalău.
Gradually, a large number of penal colonies and labor camps were established as a form of political detention for administrative detainees and became an integral part of the penitentiary system. The most important ones were along the Danube–Black Sea Canal, the Brăila Swamp, and the lead mines in northern Romania. Specific locations included: Arad, Baia Mare, Baia Sprie, Bârcea Mare, Bicaz, Borzești, Brad, Brâncovenești, CRM Bucharest, Buzău, Capu Midia, Castelu, Cavnic, Câmpulung, Cernavodă, Chilia Constanța, Chirnogi, Crâscior, Culmea, Deduleşti, Doicești, Domnești, Dorobanțu, Dudu, Fântânele, Fundulea, Galeșu, Giurgeni, Ghencea, Iași, Ițcani, Km. 31, Lucăcești, Mărculești, Mogoșoaia, Nistru, Onești, Onești Baraj, Peninsula/Valea Neagră, Periprava, Periș, Poarta Albă, Roșia Montană, Roșia Pipera, Roznov, Salcia, Grădina, Băndoiu, Strâmba, Stoeneşti, Piatra-Frecăței, Saligny, Sibiu, Simeria, Slatina, Spanțov, Tătaru, Târnăveni, Toporu, Vlădeni, Zlatna.

===Directorate for Internal Security===
The Directorate for Internal Security was originally given the task of monitoring the activities going on in the PCR. But after Ion Mihai Pacepa&#x27;s defection in 1978 and his exposing details of the Ceaușescu regime, such as the collaboration with Arab radical groups, massive espionage on American industry targets and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support, international infiltration and espionage in the Securitate only increased, much to Ceaușescu&#x27;s anger. In order to solve this problem the entire division was reorganized and was charged with rooting out dissent in the PCR. A top secret division of this Directorate was formed from forces loyal personally to Ceaușescu and charged with monitoring the Securitate itself. It acted almost as a Securitate for the Securitate, and was responsible for bugging the phones of other Securitate officers and PCR officials to ensure total loyalty.

===National Commission for Visas and Passports===
The National Commission for Visas and Passports controlled all travel and immigration in and out of Romania. In effect, traveling abroad was all but impossible for anyone but highly placed Party officials, and any ordinary Romanian who applied for a passport was immediately placed under surveillance. Many Jews and ethnic Germans were given passports and exit visas through tacit agreements with the Israeli and West German governments.

===Directorate for Security Troops===
The Directorate for Security Troops acted as a 20,000-strong paramilitary force for the government, equipped with artillery and armoured personnel carriers. The security troops selected new recruits from the same annual pool of conscripts that the armed services used. The police performed routine law enforcement functions including traffic control and issuance of internal identification cards to citizens. Organized in the late 1940s to defend the new regime, in 1989 the security troops had 20,000 soldiers. They were an elite, specially trained paramilitary force organized like motorized rifle (infantry) units equipped with small arms, artillery, and armored personnel carriers, but their mission was considerably different.

The security troops were directly responsible through the Minister of the Interior to Ceaușescu. They guarded important installations including PCR county and central office buildings and radio and television stations. The Ceaușescu regime presumably could call the security troops into action as a private army to defend itself against a military coup d&#x27;état or other domestic challenges and to suppress antiregime riots, demonstrations, or strikes.

To ensure total loyalty amongst these crack troops, there were five times as many political officers in the Directorate for Security Troops as there were in the regular army. They adhered to stricter discipline than in the regular military, but were rewarded with special treatment and enjoyed far superior living conditions compared to their countrymen. They guarded television and radio stations, as well as PCR buildings. In the event of a coup, they would have been called in to protect the regime.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Directorate for Security Troops was disbanded and replaced first by the Guard and Order Troops (&quot;Trupele de Pază și Ordine&quot;), and in July 1990 by the Gendarmerie.

===Directorate for Militia===
The Directorate for Militia controlled Romania&#x27;s Miliția, the standard police force, which carried out regular policing tasks such as traffic control, public order, etc. In 1990 it was replaced by the Romanian Police.

===Directorate V===
Directorate V were bodyguards for important governmental officials. Colonel Dumitru Burlan was the chief of bodyguards of President Nicolae Ceaușescu, and served once as his stand-in (double), but was not able to protect Ceaușescu from arrest and execution during the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

== Funding ==

=== IKEA ===
In the 1980s under the rule of the Romanian Communist Dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, Romania&#x27;s secret police, the &#x27;Securitate&#x27;, received six-figure payments from IKEA. According to declassified files at the , IKEA agreed to overcharge for products made in Romania and some of the overpayment funds were deposited into an account controlled by the Securitate.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service (HMPS) is a part of HM Prison and Probation Service (formerly the National Offender Management Service), which is the part of His Majesty&#x27;s Government charged with managing most of the prisons within England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own prison services: the Scottish Prison Service and the Northern Ireland Prison Service, respectively).

The Director General of HMPS, currently Phil Copple, is the administrator of the prison service. The Director General reports to the Secretary of State for Justice and also works closely with the Prisons Minister, a junior ministerial post within the Ministry of Justice.

The statement of purpose for His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service states that &quot;[His] Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service serves the public by keeping in custody those committed by the courts. Our duty is to look after them with humanity and help them lead law abiding and useful lives in custody and after release&quot;. The Ministry of Justice&#x27;s objective for prisons seeks &quot;Effective execution of the sentences of the courts so as to reduce re-offending and protect the public&quot;.

It has its head office in Clive House in London, and previously its head office was in Cleland House in the City of Westminster, London.

The British Overseas Territory of Bermuda&#x27;s HM Prison Service (renamed the &quot;Department of Corrections&quot; in 2002) is a separate organisation.

==Operation==
In 2004, the Prison Service was responsible for 130 prisons and employed around 44,000 staff. the number of prisons had risen by one (of which 11 were privately owned).

Population statistics for the service are published weekly. Those for 24 June 2016 counted 85,130 prisoners; 95.47% were male. Those for the year to 31 March 2019 showed a fall to 83,013 (annual average); 95% were male.

HMPPS has a duty to implement the sentences and orders of the courts, to protect the public and to rehabilitate offenders. There are various ways a prisoner can be purposefully rehabilitated; including education, training, work and undertaking targeted accredited programmes.

Prisoners in England and Wales have a daily regime which might include employment and training on temporary licence outside of prison. In financial year 2018/19, 12,100 prisoners on average were employed in custody, delivering 17.1 million hours worked over the year. Average monthly net earnings per prisoner was £1,083 before the Prisoner Earnings Act (PEA) levy was applied.

On 31 March 2019, there were 37,735 staff in post. This was an increase of 2,452 staff on 31 March 2018, when a total of 35,293 were staff in post. Over the two-year period from 31 March 2017 to the latest year, 4,894 extra staff were in post (32,841 staff were in post on 31 March 2017).

Drug finds in prisons again rose; in the 12 months to March 2019, they numbered 18,435 an increase of 41% over the previous alike period.

==History==
===18th century===
During the eighteenth century, a wide variety of measures were used to punish crime, including fines, the pillory, and whipping. Until 1776, transportation to the American colonies was often offered as an alternative to the death penalty; which could be imposed for many offences including pilfering. When prison spaces were exhausted in 1776, sailing vessels (&quot;hulks&quot;) were used for temporary confinement.

The most notable reformer was high sheriff of Bedfordshire John Howard. Having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, Howard published &quot;The State of the Prisons&quot; in 1777. He discovered prisoners who were confined, despite being acquitted, as they could not pay the jailer&#x27;s fees. Howard proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell, with separate sections for female felons, male felons, young offenders, and debtors. The prison reform charity, the Howard League for Penal Reform, is Howard&#x27;s namesake.

The Penitentiary Act passed in 1779 following Howard&#x27;s agitation. It introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction, a labour regime, and proposed two state penitentiaries: one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France, so jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years providing magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms. In 1815 jail fees were abolished.

===19th century===
Quakers such as Elizabeth Fry continued to publicise the dire state of prisons as did Charles Dickens about the Marshalsea in his novels &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. Samuel Romilly managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the Panopticon for the design of prisons and the use of the treadwheel as a means of hard labour. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline. Robert Peel&#x27;s Gaols Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 64) attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act 1877.

The American separate system attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of Millbank Prison in 1816 and Pentonville prison in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and Joshua Jebb set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year.

The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using tread-wheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the &#x27;flood of criminals&#x27; released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel Edmund Frederick du Cane, was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of &#x27;hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed&#x27;. In 1877 he encouraged Disraeli&#x27;s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons. By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.

The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. From 1877, a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localised prisons were nationalised in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to enact multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicised process of Parliament.

===20th Century===
The Probation of Offenders Act 1907 introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for the transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organised to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67) prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, the chair of the Prison Commission.

====Winston Churchill====
Major reforms were championed by the Liberal Party government in 1906–1914. The key player was Winston Churchill when he was the Liberal Home Secretary, 1910–1911. He first achieved fame as a prisoner in the Boer war in 1899. He escaped after 28 days and the media, and his own book, made him a national hero overnight. He later wrote, &quot;I certainly hated my captivity more than I have ever hated any other in my whole life. ... Looking back on those days I&#x27;ve always felt the keenest pity for prisoners and captives.&quot; As Home Secretary he was in charge of the nation&#x27;s penal system. Biographer Paul Addison says. &quot;More than any other Home Secretary of the 20th century, Churchill was the prisoner&#x27;s friend. He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.&quot; He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, especially those imprisoned for their delay in paying fines, or for debts. He shortened their terms, and made life in prison more tolerable, and rehabilitation more likely. His reforms were not politically popular, but they had a major long-term impact on the British penal system.

====Borstal system====

In 1894–1895, Herbert Gladstone&#x27;s Committee on Prisons showed that criminal propensity peaked from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called &quot;Borstal&quot; after the village in Kent which housed the first one in 1902. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when Alexander Paterson became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the English public school: cellblocks were designated as &#x27;houses&#x27; by name and had a &quot;housemaster&quot;. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. 

Borstal populations remained at a low level until after the Second World War when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself. Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including open prisons and housemasters (renamed &quot;assistant governors&quot;), and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service.

In 1988, borstals were replaced with young offender institutions for those aged 18-20, and secure children’s homes for those aged 10-17. Education, training and support are still the main focuses.

====Later Reforms====
In general, the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.

In 1979, the government of Margaret Thatcher began implementing the &quot;short, sharp shock&quot; programme. However, it was soon found to have had no effect on reoffending, with more than half of offenders being convicted again within a year, and was abandoned.

===21st century===
Early in 2004, it was announced that the Prison Service would be integrated into a new National Offender Management Service later in the year.

In 2008, there were plans for rationalisation of the prison management system with the advent of the Titan Prison concept, however these were abandoned in 2009.

In 2016, six existing prisons were give prisons&quot;, with prison governors in charge of operation and budget. Penal charities claimed reforms would fail if prisoners were &quot;crammed into filthy institutions with no staff&quot;. The reforms have not expand beyond the first six prisons as planned, as the necessary legislation has stalled due to the 2017 UK general election.

In 2017, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) became Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS), now known as His Majesty&#x27;s Prison and Probation Service following Charles III&#x27;s accession to the throne in September 2022.

==Current issues==

The imprisonment rate for England and Wales is the highest in western Europe, and at roughly the &quot;midpoint&quot; worldwide. The prison population numbered 83,165 in August 2018. The Ministry of Justice has projected that this will rise to 86,400 by March 2023. The government plans to increase the time some prisoners spend in prison.

Recent issues affecting the prison system include overcrowding, lower levels of staffing and the increased availability of synthetic cannabinoids and drones for smuggling. Despite a fall in crime rates between 2010 and 2016, the prison population continued to rise, while staff numbers were reduced, with the number of prison officers being reduced from 25,000 in 2010 to about 18,000 in 2015. There has been a particularly sharp rise in the number of prisoners above the age of 60. The head of the Prison Governors&#x27; Association suggested in 2017 that prison sentences of less than a year should be replaced with alternative punishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc10/10/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the age of several prisons. A 2015 announcement from the government agreed that old prisons are more expensive to run and often unsuitable in design, such as having &quot;dark corners which too often facilitate violence and drug-taking.&quot;

In July 2018, the Government announced &quot;a £30 million investment including £16 million to improve conditions for prisoners and staff and £7 million on new security measures, including airport-security style scanners, improved searching techniques and phone-blocking technology&quot;.

In The Lammy Review, a report commissioned by the Conservative government and led by David Lammy MP, it was found that whilst adult prison populations are 24% BAME individuals, only 6% of prison staff were from Black and Minority Ethnic communities. This was one of the significant factors listed as the cause for mis-trust between BAME prisoners and prison staff which then impacts the percentage of black and minority ethnic prisoners that have access to rehabilitation programmes in prison and therefore, increase their chances of re-offending after leaving prison.

==Prison officers==
===Recent development===
Historically, uniformed prison staff were under the supervision of a small number of very senior and experienced officers who held one of three chief officer ranks. Below these were the ranks of principal officer (rank badgetwo Bath stars) and senior officer (rank badgesingle Bath star). However, as a reorganisation in the 1980s, termed &quot;A Fresh Start&quot;, saw these chief officer ranks abolished, and their role taken by junior grade prison governors.

From 2000 onwards, as part of a process to increase accountability within the prison service, all operational officers have been assigned a three-digit unique identification number, worn on all items of uniform (typically as an embroidered epaulette) along with the two-digit LIDS identification code of the specific prison or institution. From 2010 onwards, attempts were made to replace the principal officer rank with non-uniformed junior managers (developing prison service managers – DPSM), although this process was neither entirely successful nor fully implemented. Further restructuring in 2013, known as &quot;Fair &amp; Sustainable&quot;, saw the remaining historic ranks and rank insignia phased out in favour of a new structure, and simple stripes on uniform epaulettes to indicate grades.

===Uniforms===
Prison officers wear a white shirt and black tie, black trousers, black boots, black &#x27;Nato&#x27; jumper or black soft shell fleece-jacket (or both).

Prison officers working in the Juvenile or Immigration Detention estate wear a &#x27;soft uniform&#x27; consisting of a polo shirt opposed to white shirt with black tie.

For formal occasions, a dark tunic with whistle on a chain is worn with a tie and peaked cap for men and bowler cap and open collar for women. Black gloves and shoes are worn, as are any medals/ribbons that have been awarded. Rank is worn on epaulettes and on the shoulders of uniforms.

===Powers and structure===
Public sector prison officers (historically known as warders), under the Prison Act 1952, have &quot;all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of a constable&quot; whilst acting as such.

Under the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 it is an offence to assault (amongst others) a prison officer and is punishable by up to twelve months in prison, as well as a fine. Murder of a prison officer who was acting in the execution of their duty at the time can result in a whole life order being imposed.

Although the system is flexible in operation, most prison officers work in small teams, either assigned to a specific duty, or providing one shift of staff for the supervision of a particular wing within a prison.

Each such team is, in many instances, led by a supervising officer.

An overall manager of the wing has the title of custodial manager. They have direct management of the wing and the line management of the officers and supervising officers.

===Equipment===
Most prison officers, when working on the landings, carry:

* baton – usually an Monadnock AutoLock 21” in length, for self-defence
* radio – for communication between officers and the control room
* keys – worn on a long key-chain
* body cameras – worn on the chest
* rigid-bar handcuff – TCH 842 like the Hiatt speedcuffs type are being phased in as part of general issue kit
* PAVA spray – see below.

In 2018, it was reported by the GOV UK website that prison officers would start to be equipped with PAVA incapacitating spray:

The government said that this would be &quot;fully rolled out by April 2019&quot; and that &quot;the decision follows a successful trial by HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) at 4 prisons&quot;. The four prisons involved in the trial were HMPs Hull, Preston, Risley and Wealstun.

In 2023, the government reported that now all HM Prison fficers &quot;have access to&quot; body worn video cameras.

===Rank insignia===
===Location prefixes===
===Specialist roles===
In addition to uniformed officers carrying out security and custodial roles, a number of specialist functions exist within every prison. Some are assigned to uniformed specialist officers, while others are carried out by non-uniformed support staff.

Before the &quot;Fresh Start&quot; initiative there were more uniformed specialist officer roles, including dog handlers, works officers, hospital officers, catering officers, physical education officers, and officer instructors. Today the uniformed specialist officer roles include dog handlers (DH), works officers (W), and healthcare officers (H) and physical exercise instructors (PEI) who are the successors of the former hospital officers. The roles of the former catering officers, PE officers, and officer instructors are today taken by non-uniformed caterers, PE instructors, and educational/vocational instructors. Other key non-uniformed roles within the staff of a prison include chaplains, psychologists, and administrators.

==Private prisons==
Privately managed prisons were introduced in the 1990s. Currently, there are 15 prisons in the UK run by third parties: HMP Altcourse, HMP Ashfield, HMP Bronzefield, HMP Doncaster, HMP Dovegate, Five Wells Prison, HMP Forest Bank, HMP Lowdham Grange, HMP Oakwood, HMP Parc, HMP Peterborough, HMP Rye Hill, HMP Thameside and HMP Northumberland. These are run by three third party contractor companies: G4S, Serco and Sodexo.

==Ban on industrial action==
Questions were raised about the status of the POA (Prison Officers&#x27; Association) in the 1990s. In 1994, a legal decision determined that it was illegal to induce prison officers to take industrial action – a law which had applied to police officers since 1919 – meaning that the POA could not call strike action amongst its members. New labour legislation introduced by the Conservative government in 1992 laid down that the POA could no longer be a trade union. This was reversed in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, but prison officers were still denied the right to take industrial action. This right was restored in March 2005 to prison officers in the public sector in England, Wales and Scotland, but not in Northern Ireland or to prison custody officers in the private sector.

On 29 August 2007, the POA started a 24-hour walkout of prisons, picketing establishments asking prison officers not to attend work for their shift. This was the first ever national strike action taken by the POA. The POA reported that 90% of its members (27,000) went on strike that day.

In January 2008, the Home Secretary announced that the government was to introduce legislation to remove the right for prison officers in England and Wales to take strike action. This legislation was enacted as section 138 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. In November 2016, the High Court approved a government request to stop industrial action taking place. In July 2017 the government won a High Court bid to obtain a permanent ban on industrial action by prison officers.

==Independent Monitoring Board==
Every prison and immigration removal centre has an Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), formerly known as a &quot;Board of Visitors&quot;. Members of the IMB, who are volunteers, are appointed by the Home Secretary and act as &#x27;watchdogs&#x27; for both the Minister of Prisons and the general public, to ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained. An analysis of the reporting of IMBs found that while there may be some problems with their training and undertaking of duties, their monitoring and surveillance of the detention estate can be more than symbolic and may further the humane and just treatment of the state&#x27;s most vulnerable citizens.

==HMPS in the National Offender Management Service==
On 6 January 2004, then Home Secretary David Blunkett announced that the Prison Service, together with the National Probation Service, was to be integrated into a new National Offender Management Service. The Service, Blunkett said, will be &quot;a new body to provide end-to-end management of all offenders&quot;.

On 1 April 2008, NOMS was reorganised as part of a shake-up in the Ministry of Justice. The headquarters and regional structures of NOMS and HMPS were merged into a single HQ structure with Phil Wheatly as Director General of NOMS. This brings HMPS and the National Probation Service under a single headquarters structure for the first time ever.

On 1 June 2011, NOMS was merged with the wider MoJ (HMCTS etc.) to form one organisation. Although HMCTS and NOMS are working under different terms and conditions, they are now managed together and HR is dealt with by one Shared Service centre. A review of terms and conditions for all MoJ staff, including NOMS, is currently in progress with view to bringing all staff terms and conditions across NOMS and HMCTS in line.

<doc id="429452" wikidata="Q6044916" url="?curid=429452" title="InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington">
<text>The InterFaith Council of Metropolitan Washington (IFC or IFCMW) is an American interfaith non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. The organization was founded in 1978 and the Reverend Clark Lobenstine served as the first Executive Director from 1979–2014. Reverend David Lindsey is the current Executive Director. The IFC brings together eleven historic faith communities to promote dialogue, understanding and community and to work on projects of common interest throughout the DC region. Through its events, resources and collaborations, IFC aspires to uphold the worth and dignity of all people and all life, to provide opportunities for interfaith engagement, increase religious literacy and promote mutual respect among diverse faiths.

==History==
In an interview with the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs in 2011, Executive Director Lobenstine said, &quot;The Interfaith Conference was founded by the Islamic, Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Jewish communities and was the first organization to engage the Islamic community back in a metropolitan area in both interfaith dialogue and interfaith collaboration for justice in 1978. Since then Baháʼí, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Latter Day Saint, Sikh, and Zoroastrian believers have joined. We now represent eleven faith-based communities. The founders before I started were clear that the Conference wouldn’t do service, but rather enact justice by building a just community as well as through interfaith dialogue. These principles continue to guide us still and our Center for Nurturing Understanding is focused on applying those ideals to young people.&quot;

<text>The World Professional Darts Championship is one of the most important tournaments in the darts calendar. Originally held as an annual event between 1978 and 1993, players then broke off into two separate organisations after a controversial split in the game. Each organisation, the British Darts Organisation (BDO) and the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) then arranged their own World Championships, the former in January the latter in December. As a result, there was no longer a unified world champion in the sport for nearly three decades. 

The BDO version dated back to 1978, when it was held at the Heart of the Midlands nightclub, Nottingham. The following year it moved to the Jollees Cabaret Club, Stoke, where it stayed until 1985. From then until 2019 it was held at the Lakeside Leisure Complex at Frimley Green, Surrey. In 2020 the tournament was held at The O2 Arena in London. The BDO went into liquidation in 2020 and the World Darts Federation announced later that they would be creating their own version of a World Championship, returning to the Lakeside Leisure Complex. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their version didn&#x27;t get underway until 2022. Since qualification for the BDO version was always based on WDF rankings, most of the player pool and legacy of this new version of the World Championship is based on the old BDO system. 

The PDC version has been running since 1994 after &quot;the split&quot;, with a field of players containing all active previous World Champions from the BDO. It was originally staged at Purfleet&#x27;s Circus Tavern, Essex, before moving to its current home Alexandra Palace, London, for the 2008 World Championship.

<doc id="429458" wikidata="Q666374" url="?curid=429458" title="Mkhedrioni">
<text>The Mkhedrioni was a paramilitary group in the Republic of Georgia, known for its high-profile involvement in the Georgian Civil War and the War in Abkhazia. It was outlawed since 1995 but subsequently reconstituted as the Union of Patriots political party. However, failing to secure registration, it soon faded into obscurity.

==Background==
Founded in 1989 by Jaba Ioseliani, the Mkhedrioni presented itself as the heir to historic Georgian guerrilla groups who fought Iranian and Ottoman occupiers. The group&#x27;s name literally means &quot;horsemen&quot;, but in Georgian it has a meaning closer to &quot;knights&quot; (this alternative translation has occasionally been used). Each member of the organization would take an oath to defend Georgia&#x27;s people, the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church and Georgia&#x27;s land, and wore a medallion with a scene of Saint George slaying the dragon on one side and the bearer&#x27;s name and blood type on the other.

The establishment of the Mkhedrioni took place as Georgia moved towards independence in the final years of the Soviet Union. Relations between Georgian nationalists and the country&#x27;s national minorities, especially the Abkhaz and Ossetians, were difficult at best even during Soviet rule and grew more tense during the rise to power of the nationalist dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The Mkhedrioni was one of a number of nationalist paramilitary groups established during this period as a counterbalance to similar paramilitary organisations set up by rival nationalists elsewhere in Georgia.

The Mkhedrioni&#x27;s members gained an unpleasant reputation as heavily armed thugs who engaged in violent intimidation of their rivals. They were highly visible, wearing what amounted to a uniform of jeans, sweaters and jackets, topped off by sunglasses (even worn indoors). Leaders wore Armani suits bulging with guns, according to one author. Mkhedrioni relied on illegal sources of income (targeting gasoline supplies) and exploited connections with Moscow&#x27;s Georgian underworld. Mkhedrioni members were often accused of criminal activity, extorting &quot;protection money&quot; from businesses in areas which they effectively controlled, operating roadblocks where drivers would be &quot;fined&quot;, smuggling drugs and committing robberies. By 1991, the Mkhedrioni was claimed to have had about 1,000 fighters and 10,000 associate members – considerably more than the official state National Guard.

Despite Gamsakhurdia and Ioseliani sharing a broadly similar nationalist outlook, the two men fell out badly shortly after Gamsakhurdia came to power in November 1990. In February 1991, Ioseliani was imprisoned without trial, along with many of his supporters, and the Mkhedrioni was banned. In August 1991, just after the Soviet coup attempt, Gamsakhurdia sacked Tengiz Kitovani, the commander of Georgia&#x27;s National Guard, and his Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua resigned around the same time. Kitovani soon formed an anti-Gamsakhurdia alliance with Sigua and the imprisoned Ioseliani. In December 1991, Kitovani&#x27;s supporters released Ioseliani from jail and launched a violent coup d&#x27;état against the Gamsakhurdia government in alliance with the Mkhedrioni. Intense gun battles took place in the streets of Tbilisi between the rebels and &quot;Zviadists&quot; holed up in the state parliament building during December 1991 – January 1992, which ended with Gamsakhurdia fleeing to the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya. At least 100 people were killed in the fighting.

==The Mkhedrioni after Gamsakhurdia==
The Mkhedrioni played a crucial role in suppressing the remaining &quot;Zviadists&quot; after the downfall of Gamsakhurdia. Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, was brought in to provide a respectable face for the new government, but it remained dependent on the Mkhedrioni: even inside the parliament building, Mkhedrioni gunmen had a constant presence as &quot;bodyguards&quot; for Jaba Ioseliani, who was now a member of parliament. Mkhedrioni were given the role of the interior forces under the new government.

In 1993, worsening civil strife in Abkhazia prompted the Mkhedrioni and National Guard to launch a joint operation in the region to root out separatists and Gamsakhurdia supporters. This resulted in a disastrous defeat for the pro-government forces, who were driven out of Abkhazia along with virtually the entire ethnic Georgian population of the region: over 10,000 people were killed in the fighting. In September 1993, Gamsakhurdia took the opportunity to launch an armed uprising in western Georgia in an attempt to return to power. The Mkhedrioni played an important role in suppressing the uprising and were for a while given semi-official status as the &quot;Georgian Rescue Corps&quot;. Russian intervention ensured Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s defeat and on December 31 he reportedly committed suicide, though it has also been stated, and widely believed within Georgia, that he was murdered. Mkhedrioni forces were alleged in press reports to be responsible for his death, but they denied this.

The Mkhedrioni were subsequently given responsibility for rooting out &quot;Zviadists&quot; in western Georgia, which they did with a brutal efficiency that was widely criticised by foreign governments and international human rights organisations. Shevardnadze responded by gradually limiting the organisation&#x27;s power. Although Ioseliani remained head of the supposedly civilianised organisation, it continued to function as a private army. In early 1995, Shevardnadze ordered it to disarm, accusing it of deep involvement in organised crime. He narrowly escaped assassination in a bomb attack on August 29, 1995, which he blamed on a shadowy coalition of &quot;mafia forces&quot; including Ioseliani and others. Other acts of political violence were also blamed on the Mkhedrioni. The organisation was outlawed and Ioseliani imprisoned, although many regarded the claim that it had been involved in the bombing as being inconclusively proven.

In spite of its banning, the Mkhedrioni continues to have a somewhat shadowy existence in Georgian politics. A number of members, led by Tornike Berishvili, recreated it in 1999 as an ostensibly political rather than paramilitary organisation. It has been claimed that the Mkhedrioni has had relations with Chechen separatists and continues to be involved in criminal and paramilitary activities, including continued guerrilla attacks in Abkhazia. Jaba Ioseliani was released from prison in an amnesty in April 2000 and resumed his post as head of the Mkhedrioni, declaring his intention to run for president and participate in the November 2003 parliamentary elections. However, Ioseliani died of a heart attack in March 2003.

When the Mkhedrioni failed to secure registration to stand in elections under its own name, it reconstituted itself in November 2002 as a political party called the &quot;Union of Patriots&quot; in alliance with former Gamsakhurdia supporters. It was again refused registration by the government. Its leader Badri Zarandia was assassinated on January 8, 2003.

<text>Majid Majidi () is an Iranian filmmaker and producer. In his films, Majidi has touched on many themes and genres and has won numerous international awards.

==Biography==
Born in a Persian middle-class family, he grew up in Tehran and at the age of 14 he started acting in amateur theater groups. He then studied at the Institute of Dramatic Arts in Tehran.

After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, his interest in cinema brought him to act in various films, most notably Mohsen Makhmalbaf&#x27;s &quot;Boycott&quot; in 1985.

In 1997, Majidi directed &quot;Children of Heaven&quot;, which was nominated to receive the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Though it lost to the Italian film &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; by Roberto Benigni, &quot;Children of Heaven&quot; is the first Iranian film to have been nominated by the academy.

Majidi has directed several other feature films since &quot;Children of Heaven&quot;: &quot;The Color of Paradise&quot; in 2000, &quot;Baran&quot; in 2001, and &quot;The Willow Tree&quot; in 2005 (alternative English title &quot;One Life More&quot;). He also recently directed a feature-length documentary titled &quot;Barefoot to Herat&quot; which chronicles life in refugee camps and the city of Herat during and after the anti-Taliban offensive of 2001.

In 2008, Majidi&#x27;s acclaimed film &quot;The Song of Sparrows&quot; was the opening film of the Visakhapatnam International Film Festival in India.

Majidi was one of five international film directors invited by the Beijing government to create a documentary short film to introduce the city of Beijing, in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics which was held in the Chinese capital; the project was titled &quot;Vision Beijing&quot;.

Majidi pulled out of a Danish film festival in protest against the publication in Denmark of cartoons satirizing the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. He stated that he was withdrawing &quot;to protest against insulting any religious belief or icon&quot;.

<doc id="429472" wikidata="Q478320" url="?curid=429472" title="Scottish Football Association">
<text>The Scottish Football Association (; also known as the Scottish FA and the SFA) is the governing body of football in Scotland and has the ultimate responsibility for the control and development of football in Scotland. Members of the SFA include clubs in Scotland, affiliated national associations as well as local associations. It was formed in 1873, making it the second-oldest national football association in the world. It is not to be confused with the Scottish Football Union, which is the name that the SRU was known by until the 1920s.

The Scottish Football Association is a member of both UEFA and FIFA and holds a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is responsible for the Laws of the Game. It is based at Hampden Park in Glasgow. In addition, the Scottish Football Museum is located there.

The Scottish Football Association is responsible for the operation of the Scotland national football team, the annual Scottish Cup and several other duties important to the functioning of the game in Scotland.

==History==
===Formation===
Following the formation of Scotland&#x27;s earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.

Queen&#x27;s Park, a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs – Queen&#x27;s Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville – attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to join.

That day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that:

===Founding members===

The following eight football clubs founded the Scottish Football Association:

===Chief Executive/Secretary===
The chief executive of the Scottish Football Association oversees the development of football in Scotland and the administration of disciplinary matters, and is also responsible for the general organisation of the national side. One of the most prominent roles of the chief executive is to hire and dismiss Scotland national football team managers.

* Archibald Rae (1873–1874)
* J.C. Mackay (1874–1875)
* William Dick (1875–1880)
* James Fleming (1880–1882)
* Robert Livingstone (1882)
* John McDowall (1882–1928)
* Sir George Graham (1928–1957)

<text>In linguistics, Aeolic Greek (), also known as Aeolian (), Lesbian or Lesbic dialect, is the set of dialects of Ancient Greek spoken mainly in Boeotia; in Thessaly; in the Aegean island of Lesbos; and in the Greek colonies of Aeolis in Anatolia and adjoining islands.

The Aeolic dialect shows many archaisms in comparison to the other Ancient Greek dialects (Arcadocypriot, Attic, Ionic, and Doric varieties), as well as many innovations.

Aeolic Greek is widely known as the language of Sappho and of Alcaeus of Mytilene. Aeolic poetry, which is exemplified in the works of Sappho, mostly uses four classical meters known as the Aeolics: Glyconic (the most basic form of Aeolic line), hendecasyllabic verse, Sapphic stanza, and Alcaic stanza (the latter two are respectively named for Sappho and Alcaeus).

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

====Labiovelars====
Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Greek &quot;*&quot; changed to Aeolic &quot;p&quot; everywhere. By contrast, PIE &quot;*&quot; changed to Attic/Ionic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric &quot;t&quot; before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;.
* PIE * → Lesbian písures&quot;, Boeotian péttares&quot; ~ Attic téttares, Ionic tésseres&quot;, Doric tétores&quot; &quot;four&quot;
Similarly PIE/PGk &quot;*&quot; always became &quot;b&quot; and PIE &quot;*&quot; &gt; PGk &quot;*&quot; always became &quot;ph&quot; (whereas in other dialects they became alternating &quot;b&quot;/&quot;d&quot; and &quot;ph&quot;/&quot;th&quot; before back/front vowels).

Labiovelars were treated the same way in the P-Celtic languages and the Sabellic languages.

A Proto-Greek consonant cluster with &quot;h&quot; (from Indo-European ) and a sonorant (&quot;r, l, n, m, w, y&quot;) changed to the double sonorant (&quot;rr, ll, nn, mm, ww, yy&quot;) in Lesbian and Thessalian (sub-dialects of Aeolic) by assimilation. In Attic/Ionic, Doric, and Boeotian Aeolic, the &quot;h&quot; assimilated to the vowel before the consonant cluster, causing the vowel to lengthen by compensatory lengthening.
: PIE &quot;VsR&quot; or &quot;VRs&quot; → Attic/Ionic-Doric-Boeotian &quot;VVR&quot;.
: PIE &quot;VsR&quot; or &quot;VRs&quot; → Lesbian-Thessalian &quot;VRR&quot;.
* PIE * → Proto-Greek &quot;*ehmi&quot; → Lesbian-Thessalian emmi&quot; ~ Attic/Ionic ēmi&quot; (= ) &quot;I am&quot;

====Loss of h====
Lesbian Aeolic lost initial &quot;h-&quot; (&quot;psilosis&quot; &quot;stripping&quot;) from Proto-Indo-European s- or y-. By contrast, Ionic sometimes retains it, and Attic always retains it.
* PIE * → Proto-Greek *hāwélios&quot; → Lesbian &quot;āélios&quot;, Ionic &quot;ēélios&quot; ~ Attic hēlios&quot; &quot;sun&quot;

====Retention of w====
In Thessalian and Boeotian (sub-dialects of Aeolic) and Doric, the Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Greek semi-vowel &quot;w&quot; (digamma) was retained at the beginning of a word.
* PIE → Boeotian, Doric &quot;wépos&quot; ~ Attic-Ionic &quot;épos&quot; &quot;word&quot;, &quot;epic&quot; (compare Latin &quot;vōx&quot; &quot;voice&quot;)

===Vowels===

====Long a====
In Aeolic and Doric, Proto-Greek long &quot;ā&quot; remains. By contrast, in Attic, long &quot;ā&quot; changes to long &quot;ē&quot; in most cases; in Ionic, it changes everywhere.
* PIE → Aeolic, Doric mātēr ~ Attic/Ionic &quot;mētēr&quot; &quot;mother&quot;

====Compensatory lengthening====
Compensatory lengthening of &quot;a, e, o&quot; in Lesbian gives &quot;ai, ei, oi&quot; (in Attic, it would be &quot;ā, ei, ou&quot;) for example in the accusative plural of a and o stem nouns, or in many 3 Pl verb conjugations.

====Boeotian====
In Boeotian, the vowel-system was, in many cases, changed in a way reminiscent of the modern Greek pronunciation.
* Attic/Ionic ~ Boeotian ~ Modern Greek 
* Attic/Ionic ~ Boeotian ~ Modern Greek 
* Attic/Ionic ~ Boeotian ~ Mediaeval Greek and Old Athenaean ~ Modern Greek 

===Accent===
In Lesbian Aeolic, the accent of all words is recessive (&quot;barytonesis&quot;), as is typical only in the verbs of other dialects.
* Attic/Ionic potamós ~ Lesbian pótamos &quot;river&quot;

==Morphology==
Contracted or vowel-stem verbs that are thematic in Attic/Ionic are often athematic (&quot;-mi&quot;) in Aeolic.
* Ionic &quot;philéō&quot;, Attic &quot;philô&quot; ~ Aeolic &quot;phílēmi&quot; &quot;I love&quot;

Aeolic athematic infinitive active ends in &quot;-men&quot; or (Lesbian) &quot;-menai&quot;. ~ Attic/Ionic has &quot;-enai&quot;.
* Lesbian &quot;émmen, émmenai&quot;; Thessalian, Boeotian &quot;eîmen&quot; ~ Attic/Ionic &quot;eînai&quot; (spurious diphthong) &quot;to be&quot;
In the Lesbian dialect this ending also extends to the thematic conjugation, where Attic/Ionic has &quot;-ein&quot;. All three of these Aeolic endings occur in Homer.
* Homeric &quot;agémen&quot;

Proto-Greek &quot;-ans&quot; and &quot;-ons&quot; → &quot;-ais&quot; and &quot;-ois&quot; (first- and second declension accusative plural) ~ Attic/Ionic -&quot;ās&quot; and &quot;-ōs&quot; (-ους).

Dative plural &quot;-aisi&quot; and &quot;-oisi&quot; ~ Attic/Ionic &quot;-ais&quot; and &quot;-ois&quot;.

The participle has &quot;-ois&quot; and &quot;-ais&quot; for Attic &quot;-ōs&quot; (-ους), &quot;-ās&quot;.

<doc id="429477" wikidata="Q4970618" url="?curid=429477" title="British Poetry Revival">
<text>The British Poetry Revival is the general name now given to a loose movement in the United Kingdom that took place in the late 1960s and 1970s. The term was a neologism first used in 1964, postulating a New British Poetry to match the anthology &quot;The New American Poetry&quot; (1960) edited by Donald Allen.

The Revival was a modernist-inspired, primarily by Basil Bunting&#x27;s works, reaction to the Movement&#x27;s more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation—Bob Cobbing, Paula Claire, Tom Raworth, Eric Mottram, Jeff Nuttall, the Finnish poet Anselm Hollo, Andrew Crozier, the Canadian poet Lionel Kearns, Lee Harwood, Allen Fisher, Iain Sinclair—and a younger generation: Paul Buck, Bill Griffiths, John Hall, John James, Gilbert Adair, Lawrence Upton, Peter Finch, Ulli Freer, Ken Edwards, Robert Gavin Hampson, Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, Robert Sheppard Paul Evans, Adrian Clarke, Clive Fencott, Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan, Cris Cheek, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley.

==Beginnings==
Poets associated with the British Poetry Revival generally looked to modernist models, such as the American poets Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams and Charles Olson and British figures such as David Jones, Basil Bunting and Hugh MacDiarmid. By the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that these older writers had opened up. They included Roy Fisher, Gael Turnbull, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Bob Cobbing, Jeff Nuttall, Tom Raworth, Michael Horovitz, Eric Mottram, Peter Finch, Edwin Morgan, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, Lee Harwood, and Christopher Logue.

Many of these poets joined Allen Ginsberg and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall International Poetry Incarnation on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British happening. Earlier British happenings included John Latham&#x27;s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; Gustav Metzger&#x27;s 1964 auto-destructive art; Adrian Henri&#x27;s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool&#x27;s The Cavern Club; and Jeff Nuttall&#x27;s events in Better Books. They had their roots in Dada events at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich at the start of the century.

Fisher, a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of William Carlos Williams&#x27;s &quot;Paterson&quot; to his native Birmingham in his long poem &quot;City&quot;. Turnbull, who spent some time in the USA, was also influenced by Williams. His fellow Scots Morgan and Finlay both worked with found, sound and visual poetry. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the Beat generation writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the Black Mountain poets; while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the New York School.

Publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry included Turnbull&#x27;s Migrant Press, Raworth&#x27;s Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;New Departures&quot;, Stuart Montgomery&#x27;s Fulcrum Press, Tim Longville&#x27;s &quot;Grosseteste Review&quot;, Galloping Dog Press and its &quot;Poetry Information&quot; magazine, Pig Press, Andrew Crozier and Peter Riley&#x27;s &quot;The English Intelligencer&quot;, Crozier&#x27;s Ferry Press, and Cobbing&#x27;s Writers Forum. Many of these presses and magazines also published &quot;avant-garde&quot; American and European poetry. The first representative anthology of the new movement was Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain&quot; (1969). A broader view of the first and second generations of the Revival is in the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in &quot;The New British Poetry&quot; (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides an account of some of this activity in his chapter &quot;The British Poetry Revival&quot; in his book, &quot;The Poetry of Saying&quot; (Liverpool University Press, 2005)&#x27;, while Juha Virtanen wrote a Revival monograph, &quot;Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).

==England==
===London===

Thanks in no small part to Cobbing&#x27;s Writers Forum and its associated writers&#x27; workshop, London was a hub for many young poets, including Bill Griffiths, Paula Claire, Allen Fisher, Iain Sinclair, Gilbert Adair, Lawrence Upton, Peter Finch, Ulli Freer, Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, Robert Sheppard, Adrian Clarke, Clive Fencott, Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan, cris cheek, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in &quot;CLASP: late modernist poetry in London&quot; (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards, and in Ken Edwards&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Wild Metrics&quot;.

Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of Anglo-Saxon and his years as a Hells Angel. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for William Blake and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Bridge&quot; and &quot;Lud Heat&quot; and Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Place&quot; sequence of books. O&#x27;Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British women poets to combine feminist concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths&#x27;s poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), &quot;Bill Griffiths&quot; (Salt, 2007). For more on Sinclair, see Robert Sheppard, &quot;Iain Sinclair&quot; (Northcote House, 2007) or Brian Baker, Iain Sinclair (Manchester UP, 2007). For Fisher, see Robert Hampson and cris cheek (eds), &quot;The Allen Fisher Companion&quot; (Shearsman, 2020).

Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair&#x27;s early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing&#x27;s Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.

Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the Beat generation writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram&#x27;s presence there, King&#x27;s College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, Sean Bonney, Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, Ken Edwards, Bill Griffiths, Robert Gavin Hampson, Jeff Hilson, Will Rowe, and Lawrence Upton.

=== Northern England===

By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in Newcastle and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published &quot;Briggflatts&quot;, which is widely considered to be his masterpiece. A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, Connie and Tom Pickard started a reading series and bookshop in the Morden Tower Book Room. The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg. Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso and the Canadian poets Gerry Gilbert and Lionel Kearns all read there. They were soon joined by Richard Caddel, brought up in Kent but an honorary Northumbrian, Barry MacSweeney and Colin Simms. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, Tony Baker, and Tom Pickard in Geraldine Monk (ed.) &quot;CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition&quot; (Shearsman, 2012).

Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the Objectivist poets. Specifically, Louis Zukofsky and Lorine Niedecker were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on George Oppen. Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting&#x27;s interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet&#x27;s insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.

At Easter, 1967 MacSweeney organised the Sparty Lea Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, John James, John Temple, Pete Armstrong, Tim Longville, Peter Riley, John Hall, J. H. Prynne and Nick Waite, stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea. This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other&#x27;s work.

Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, Geraldine Monk is very much a poet of the North of England. Like Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan, she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk&#x27;s edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including Jim Burns, Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed, &quot;CUSP&quot;, mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.

===Cambridge===

The Cambridge poets were a group centred around J. H. Prynne and included Andrew Crozier, John James, Douglas Oliver, Veronica Forrest-Thomson, Peter Riley, Tim Longville and John Riley. Prynne was influenced by Charles Olson and Crozier was partly responsible for Carl Rakosi&#x27;s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The &quot;Grosseteste Review&quot;, which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of &quot;The English Intelligencer&quot;, a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by Peter Riley. Contributors and recipients included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte.

The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at Cambridge University or at Anglia Polytechnic. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.

==Wales and Scotland==

In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, &quot;second aeon&quot;. He began Oriel Books in Cardiff in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young Welsh poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were John Freeman and Chris Torrance. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both George Oppen and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited &quot;Not Comforts / but Visions&quot;, essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, Jeremy Hooker, Freeman, Hampson and others. Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing &quot;Magic Door&quot; sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk&#x27;s &quot;CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition&quot; (Shearsman, 2012).

In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and Tom Leonard emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the Third Eye Centre in Glasgow (later renamed the Centre for Contemporary Arts). Magazines such as &quot;Scottish International&quot;, &quot;Chapman&quot;, and Duncan Glen&#x27;s magazine &quot;Akros&quot; maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.

In a similar vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.

==&quot;A treacherous assault on British poetry&quot;==

In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund Poetry Society and in the elections became the Poetry Society&#x27;s new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society&#x27;s magazine &quot;Poetry Review&quot;. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried listings of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.

Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society&#x27;s building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the Association of Little Presses (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.

In the late 1970s, in response to the number of &#x27;foreign poets&#x27; being featured in &quot;Poetry Review&quot;, Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as &quot;a treacherous assault on British poetry&quot;, according to Mottram&#x27;s preface to his section of the anthology, &quot;the new british poetry&quot;. in which he outlines some of the breadth of poetic activity from which this loose grouping emerged. An archive-based, event-history approach to subsequent events is provided by Peter Barry in his book &quot;Poetry Wars: British poetry in the 1970s and the Battle of Earls Court&quot; (Salt, 2006). An account of this &#x27;battle&#x27; from the other side is provided by James Sutherland Smith, where his comparison of the brief takeover of the Poetry Society to an attempt &quot;by the Militant Tendency to take over the Rotary Club&quot; suggests some of the political and class issues around At around the same time, the Arts Council also set up a top-down inquiry that overturned the result of the Society&#x27;s elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival. As a result of the Arts Council setting aside the votes of the members, many of the members boycotted the Society. Robert Sheppard has provided a useful critique of Barry&#x27;s account and of the tactics of the committee members: as a representative of a younger generation of poets, who had grown up through Cobbings&#x27;s writers forum workshops, whose &#x27;linguistically innovative poetry&#x27; was more akin to LANGUAGE poets than to the New American Poetry, and felt the boycott was a tactical error. 

==The 1980s and after==

A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in &quot;Poetry Review&quot; under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, Bill Griffiths, Ulli Freer, cris cheek, Lawrence Upton, Robert Gavin Hampson, Robert Sheppard, and Ken Edwards were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at Gilbert Adair&#x27;s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as Caroline Bergvall, Paul Buck, Andrew Duncan, D. S. Marriott, Maggie O&#x27;Sullivan and Denise Riley. Edwards ran &quot;Reality Studios&quot;, a magazine that grew out of Alembic (UK poetry magazine), the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based Wendy Mulford, which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based &quot;Angel Exhaust&quot; magazine brought many of the younger poets together – in particular, Adrian Clarke, Robert Sheppard and Andrew Duncan. In the Midlands, Tony Baker&#x27;s &quot;Figs&quot; magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.

In 1988 an anthology called &quot;The New British Poetry&quot; was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology &quot;A Various Art&quot;, which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work &quot;Conductors of Chaos&quot; (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), &quot;The New British poetries: the scope of the possible&quot; (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 W. N. Herbert and Richard Price co-edited the anthology of Scottish Informationist poetry &quot;Contraflow on the SuperHighway&quot; (Gairfish and Southfields Press).

The anthology &quot;Conductors of Chaos&quot; featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets David Gascoyne, selected by Jeremy Reed; W. S. Graham, selected by Tony Lopez; David Jones, selected by Drew Milne; J.F. Hendry, selected by Andrew Crozier and Nicholas Moore, selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continued, for some decades, to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of &quot;Talisman&quot; (1996). With Peter Quartermain Caddel also edited &quot;&quot; (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma&#x27;s &quot;Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry&quot; (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.

Into the 1990s and beyond poets including Johan de Wit, Sean Bonney, Jeff Hilson and Piers Hugill have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led Writers Forum workshop. A sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago, Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of Martin Gubbins, Andreas Aandwandter and Martin Bakero. Those associated with the Barque Press (most obviously Andrea Brady and Keston Sutherland), and more recently Bad Press (in particular, Marianne Morris and Jow Lindsay), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. Perdika Press in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of Bill Berkson. From Scotland, Peter Manson, who had co-edited the magazine &quot;Object Permanence&quot; in the mid-1990s, Drew Milne, editor of &quot;Parataxis&quot;, David Kinloch and Richard Price (previously editors of &quot;Verse&quot; and &quot;Southfields&quot;) also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of cris cheek, Bridgid Mcleer and Alaric Sumner, under the direction of Caroline Bergvall and John Hall through the Performance Writing programme at Dartington College of Arts including Kirsten Lavers, Andy Smith, and Chris Paul; from the involvement of Redell Olsen in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, Sophie Robinson, John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through Keith Jebb at University of Bedfordshire&#x27;s Creative Writing programme, including Alyson Torns and Allison Boast.

<text>are soft mats used as flooring material in traditional Japanese-style rooms. They are made in standard sizes, twice as long as wide, about , depending on the region. In martial arts, tatami are used for training in a dojo and for competition.

Tatami are covered with a weft-faced weave of on a warp of hemp or weaker cotton. There are four warps per weft shed, two at each end (or sometimes two per shed, one at each end, to reduce cost). The (core) is traditionally made from sewn-together rice straw, but contemporary tatami sometimes have compressed wood chip boards or extruded polystyrene foam in their cores instead or as well. The long sides are usually with brocade or plain cloth, although some tatami have no edging.

==History==

The term &quot;tatami&quot; is derived from the verb , meaning &#x27;to fold&#x27; or &#x27;to pile&#x27;. This indicates that the early tatami were thin and could be folded up when not used or piled in layers. 

Tatami were originally a luxury item for the nobility. The lower classes had mat-covered earthen floors. During the Heian period, when the shinden-zukuri architectural style of aristocratic residences was consummated, the flooring of shinden-zukuri palatial rooms were mainly wooden, and tatami were used as seating only for the highest aristocrats. 

In the Kamakura period, there arose the shoin-zukuri architectural style of residence for the samurai and priests who had gained power. This architectural style reached its peak of development in the Muromachi period, when tatami gradually came to be spread over whole rooms, beginning with small rooms. Floors completely covered with tatami came to be known as , , and rules concerning seating and etiquette determined the arrangement of the tatami in the rooms. 

Before the mid-16th century, the ruling nobility and samurai slept on tatami or woven mats called , while commoners used straw mats or loose straw for bedding. Tatami were gradually popularized and reached the homes of commoners toward the end of the 17th century.

Houses built in Japan today often have few or no tatami-floored rooms. Having just one such room is common. Rooms having tatami flooring and other such traditional architectural features are referred to as &quot;nihonma&quot; or &quot;washitsu&quot;, &quot;Japanese-style rooms&quot;.

==Size==

Tatami can be categorized by their size, correlated to their place of origin:

* tatami: , originated from Kyoto
* tatami: , also called tatami, originated from Nagoya
* tatami: , also called tatami, originated from Tokyo

In terms of traditional Japanese length units, a tatami is 1 by 0.5&quot;ken&quot;, or equivalently 6 by 3&quot;shaku&quot;. The length of these units varies regionally, which led different regions to develop separate tatami size conventions. One &quot;shaku&quot; is approximately the same length as one foot in the British-American measurement system. As for thickness, is average for tatami, while is the norm for tatami. 

A half mat is called a , and a mat of three-quarter length is called a ( or ), which is used in .

In Japan, the size of a room is usually measured in relation to the size of , about for a standard Nagoya-size tatami. Alternatively, in terms of traditional Japanese area units, room area (and especially house floor area) is measured in terms of &quot;tsubo,&quot; where one &quot;tsubo&quot; is the area of two tatami mats (forming a square); formally 1 by 1&quot;ken&quot; or about .

Some common room sizes in the Nagoya region are:
* mats = 9&quot;shaku&quot; × 9&quot;shaku&quot; ≈ 
* 6mats = 12&quot;shaku&quot; × 9&quot;shaku&quot; ≈ 
* 8mats = 12&quot;shaku&quot; × 12&quot;shaku&quot; ≈ 

Shops were traditionally designed to be mats, and Japanese tea rooms are frequently mats.

Another format is the tatami, originating from the Ryūkyū Islands, which are square and can have various measurements. tatami do not have borders, and have become popular in modern times for their simplicity.

==Layout==
There are rules concerning the number of tatami mats and their layout in a room. In the Edo period, and tatami arrangements were distinctly differentiated, with tatami rearranged depending on the occasion. In modern practice, the &quot;auspicious&quot; layout is normally used. In this arrangement, the junctions of the tatami form a &quot;T&quot; shape; in the &quot;inauspicious&quot; arrangement, the tatami are in a grid pattern wherein the junctions form a &quot;+&quot; shape. An auspicious tiling often requires the use of mats to tile a room. It is NP-complete to determine whether a large room has an auspicious arrangement using only full mats.

An inauspicious layout was used to avoid bad fortune at inauspicious events such as funerals. Now it is widely associated with bad luck and itself avoided.

<doc id="429487" wikidata="Q35218" url="?curid=429487" title="Old High German">
<text>Old High German (OHG; ) is the earliest stage of the German language, conventionally identified as the period from around 500/750 to 1050. Rather than representing a single supra-regional form of German, Old High German encompasses the numerous West Germanic dialects that had undergone the set of consonantal changes called the Second Sound Shift.

At the start of this period, dialect areas reflected the territories of largely independent tribal kingdoms, but by 788 the conquests of Charlemagne had brought all OHG dialect areas into a single polity. The period also saw the development of a stable linguistic border between German and Gallo-Romance, later French.

Old High German largely preserved the synthetic inflectional system inherited from its ancestral Germanic forms. The eventual disruption of these patterns, which led to the more analytic grammar, are generally considered to mark the transition to Middle High German.

Surviving Old High German texts were all composed in monastic scriptoria, so the overwhelming majority of them are religious in nature or, when secular, belong to the Latinate literary culture of Christianity. The earliest instances, which date to the latter half of the 8th century, are glosses—notes added to margins or between lines that provide translation of the (Latin) text or other aid to the reader.

==Periodisation==
Old High German is generally dated from around 750 to around 1050. The start of this period sees the beginning of the OHG written tradition, at first with only glosses, but with substantial translations and original compositions by the 9th century. However, the fact that the defining feature of Old High German, the Second Sound Shift, may have started as early as the 6th century and is complete by 750, means that some take the 6th century to be the start of the period. Alternatively, terms such as (&quot;pre-OHG&quot;) or (&quot;pre-literary OHG&quot;) are sometimes used for the period before 750. Regardless of terminology, all recognize a distinction between a pre-literary period and the start of a continuous tradition of written texts around the middle of the 8th century.

Differing approaches are taken, too, to the position of Langobardic. Langobardic is an Elbe Germanic and thus Upper German dialect, and it shows early evidence for the Second Sound Shift. For this reason, some scholars treat Langobardic as part of Old High German, but with no surviving texts — just individual words and names in Latin texts — and the speakers starting to abandon the language by the 8th century, others exclude Langobardic from discussion of OHG. As Heidermanns observes, this exclusion is based solely on the external circumstances of preservation and not on the internal features of the language.

The end of the period is less controversial. The sound changes reflected in spelling during the 11th century led to the remodelling of the entire system of noun and adjective declensions. There is also a hundred-year &quot;dearth of continuous texts&quot; after the death of Notker Labeo in 1022. The mid-11th century is widely accepted as marking the transition to Middle High German.

==Territory==

Old High German encompasses the dialects that had undergone the Second Sound Shift during the 6th century—namely all of the Upper and Central German dialects.

The Franks in the western part of Francia (Neustria and western Austrasia) gradually adopted Gallo-Romance by the beginning of the OHG period, with the linguistic boundary later stabilised approximately along the course of the Meuse and Moselle in the east, and the northern boundary probably a little further south than the current boundary between French and Dutch. North of this line, the Franks retained their language, but it was not affected by the Second Sound Shift, which thus separated the Low Franconian or Old Dutch varieties from the more easterly Franconian dialects which formed part of Old High German.

In the south, the Lombards, who had settled in Northern Italy, maintained their dialect until their conquest by Charlemagne in 774. After this the Germanic-speaking population, who were by then almost certainly bilingual, gradually switched to the Romance language of the native population, so that Langobardic had died out by the end of the OHG period.

At the beginning of the period, no Germanic language was spoken east of a line from Kieler Förde to the rivers Elbe and Saale, earlier Germanic speakers in the Northern part of the area having been displaced by the Slavs. This area did not become German-speaking until the German eastward expansion (&quot;Ostkolonisation&quot;, &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;) of the early 12th century, though there was some attempt at conquest and missionary work under the Ottonians.

The Alemannic polity was conquered by Clovis I in 496, and in the last twenty years of the 8th century Charlemagne subdued the Saxons, the Frisians, the Bavarians, and the Lombards, bringing all continental Germanic-speaking peoples under Frankish rule. While this led to some degree of Frankish linguistic influence, the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, and this unification did not therefore lead to any development of a supra-regional variety of Frankish nor a standardized Old High German; the individual dialects retained their identity.

==Dialects==
There was no standard or supra-regional variety of Old High German—every text is written in a particular dialect, or in some cases a mixture of dialects. Broadly speaking, the main dialect divisions of Old High German seem to have been similar to those of later periods—they are based on established territorial groupings and the effects of the Second Sound Shift, which have remained influential until the present day. But because the direct evidence for Old High German consists solely of manuscripts produced in a few major ecclesiastical centres, there is no isogloss information of the sort on which modern dialect maps are based. For this reason the dialects may be termed &quot;monastery dialects&quot; (German &quot;Klosterdialekte&quot;).

The main dialects, with their bishoprics and monasteries:

* Central German
** East Franconian: Fulda, Bamberg, Würzburg
** Middle Franconian: Trier, Echternach, Cologne
** Rhine Franconian: Lorsch, Speyer, Worms, Mainz, Frankfurt
** South Rhine Franconian: Wissembourg
* Upper German
** Alemannic: Murbach, Reichenau, Sankt Gallen, Strasbourg
** Bavarian: Freising, Passau, Regensburg, Augsburg, Ebersberg, Wessobrunn, Benediktbeuern, Tegernsee, Salzburg, Mondsee

In addition, there are two poorly attested dialects:
* Thuringian is attested only in four runic inscriptions and some possible glosses.
* Langobardic was the dialect of the Lombards who invaded Northern Italy in the 6th century, and little evidence of it remains apart from names and individual words in Latin texts, and a few runic inscriptions. It declined after the conquest of the Lombard Kingdom by the Franks in 774. It is classified as Upper German on the basis of evidence of the Second Sound Shift.

The continued existence of a West Frankish dialect in the Western, Romanized part of Francia is uncertain. Claims that this might have been the language of the Carolingian court or that it is attested in the Ludwigslied, whose presence in a French manuscript suggests bilingualism, are controversial.

==Literacy==
Old High German literacy is a product of the monasteries, notably at St. Gallen, Reichenau Island and Fulda. Its origins lie in the establishment of the German church by Saint Boniface in the mid-8th century, and it was further encouraged during the Carolingian Renaissance in the 9th.
The dedication to the preservation of Old High German epic poetry among the scholars of the Carolingian Renaissance was significantly greater than could be suspected from the meagre survivals we have today (less than 200 lines in total between the &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot; and the &quot;Muspilli&quot;). Einhard tells how Charlemagne himself ordered that the epic lays should be collected for posterity. It was the neglect or religious zeal of later generations that led to the loss of these records. Thus, it was Charlemagne&#x27;s weak successor, Louis the Pious, who destroyed his father&#x27;s collection of epic poetry on account of its pagan content.

Rabanus Maurus, a student of Alcuin and later an abbot at Fulda, was an important advocate of the cultivation of German literacy. Among his students were Walafrid Strabo and Otfrid of Weissenburg.

Towards the end of the Old High German period, Notker Labeo was among the greatest stylists in the language, and developed a systematic orthography.

==Writing system==
Old High German marked the culmination of a shift away from runic writing of the pre-OHG period to the Latin alphabet. This shift led to considerable variations in spelling conventions, as individual scribes and scriptoria had to develop their own transliteration of sounds not native to Latin script. Otfrid von Weissenburg, in one of the prefaces to his &quot;Evangelienbuch&quot;, offers comments on and examples of some of the issues which arise in adapting the Latin alphabet for German: &quot;&quot; (&quot;...so also, in many expressions, spelling is difficult because of the piling up of letters or their unfamiliar sound.&quot;) The careful orthographies of the OHG &quot;Isidor&quot; or Notker show a similar awareness.

==Phonology==

The charts show the vowel and consonant systems of the East Franconian dialect in the 9th century. This is the dialect of the monastery of Fulda, and specifically of the Old High German &quot;Tatian&quot;. Dictionaries and grammars of OHG often use the spellings of the Tatian as a substitute for genuine standardised spellings, and these have the advantage of being recognizably close to the Middle High German forms of words, particularly with respect to the consonants.

===Vowels===
Old High German had six phonemic short vowels and five phonemic long vowels. Both occurred in stressed and unstressed syllables. In addition, there were six diphthongs.

Notes:
# Vowel length was indicated in the manuscripts inconsistently (though modern handbooks are consistent). Vowel letter doubling, a circumflex, or an acute accent was generally used to indicate a long vowel.
# The short high and mid vowels may have been articulated lower than their long counterparts as in Modern German. This cannot be established from written sources.
# All back vowels likely had front-vowel allophones as a result of umlaut. The front-vowel allophones likely became full phonemes in Middle High German. In the Old High German period, there existed (possibly a mid-close vowel) from the umlaut of and but it probably was not phonemicized until the end of the period. Manuscripts occasionally distinguish two sounds. Generally, modern grammars and dictionaries use for the mid vowel /ɛ/ and for the mid-close vowel /e/.
# On the diphthongs’ origins:
## OHG ⟨ie⟩ came from PWGmc *ē. It passed from *ē to ⟨ea⟩ to ⟨ia⟩ to ⟨ie⟩.
### *hēr &gt; ⟨hiar⟩, ⟨hia⟩
## OHG ⟨iu⟩ came from PWGmc *iu. This OHG diphthong /iu̯/ was one of the sources for the Middle High German monophthong /yː/.
### *þiudisk &gt; ⟨diutisk⟩
## OHG ⟨ei⟩ came from PWGmc *ai. PWGmc *ai monophthongized to OHG ⟨ê⟩ before certain consonants: /w/, /r/, and /x/ from PWGmc *h.
### *stain &gt; ⟨stein⟩
### *raihō &gt; ⟨rêho⟩
## OHG ⟨uo⟩ came from PWGmc *ō. It passed from *ō to ⟨oa⟩ to ⟨ua⟩ to ⟨uo⟩.
### *mōd &gt; ⟨muot⟩
## OHG ⟨io⟩ came from PWGmc *eu. It passed from *eu to ⟨eo⟩ to ⟨io⟩.
### *leuþ &gt; ⟨liod⟩
## OHG ⟨ou⟩ came from PWGmc *au. PWGmc *au monophthongized to OHG ⟨ô⟩ before certain consonants: /d/, /t/, /s/, /s̠/, /l/, /n/, /r/, and /x/ from PWGmc *h.
### *baum &gt; ⟨boum⟩
### *dauþu &gt; ⟨tôd⟩

====Reduction of unstressed vowels====
By the mid 11th century the many different vowels found in unstressed syllables had almost all been reduced to .

Examples:

(The New High German forms of these words are broadly the same as in Middle High German.)

===Consonants===

The main difference between Old High German and the West Germanic dialects from which it developed is that the former underwent the Second Sound Shift. The result of the sound change has been that the consonantal system of German is different from all other West Germanic languages, including English and Low German.

# There is wide variation in the consonant systems of the Old High German dialects, which arise mainly from the differing extent to which they are affected by the High German Sound Shift. Precise information about the articulation of consonants is impossible to establish.
#In the plosive and fricative series, if there are two consonants in a cell, the first is fortis and the second lenis. The voicing of lenis consonants varied between dialects.
#Old High German distinguished long and short consonants. Double-consonant spellings indicate not a preceding short vowel, as they do in Modern German, but true consonant gemination. Double consonants found in Old High German include &quot;pp, bb, tt, dd, ck&quot; (for ), &quot;gg, ff, ss, hh, zz, mm, nn, ll, rr.&quot;
# changes to in all dialects during the 9th century. The status in the Old High German &quot;Tatian&quot; (), as is reflected in modern Old High German dictionaries and glossaries, is that &quot;th&quot; is found in initial position and &quot;d&quot; in other positions.
# It is not clear whether Old High German had acquired a palatalized allophone after front vowels, as is the case in Modern German.
#A curly-tailed &quot;z&quot; (&quot;ȥ&quot;) is sometimes used in modern grammars and dictionaries to indicate the alveolar fricative that arose from Common Germanic &quot;t&quot; in the High German consonant shift. That distinguishes it from the alveolar affricate, which represented as &quot;z&quot;. The distinction has no counterpart in the original manuscripts, except in the Old High German &quot;Isidor&quot;, which uses &quot;tz&quot; for the affricate.
# The original Germanic fricative &quot;s&quot; was in writing usually clearly distinguished from the younger fricative &quot;z&quot; that evolved from the High German consonant shift. The sounds of both letters seem not to have merged before the 13th century. Since &quot;s&quot; later came to be pronounced before other consonants (as in &quot;Stein&quot; , &quot;Speer&quot; , &quot;Schmerz&quot; (original &quot;smerz&quot;) or the southwestern pronunciation of words like &quot;Ast&quot; ), it seems safe to assume that the actual pronunciation of Germanic &quot;s&quot; was somewhere between and , most likely about , in all Old High German until late Middle High German. A word like &quot;swaz&quot;, &quot;whatever&quot;, would thus never have been but rather , later (13th century) , .

===Phonological developments===
This list has the sound changes that transformed Common West Germanic into Old High German but not the Late OHG changes that affected Middle High German:
* , &gt; , in all positions ( &gt; already took place in West Germanic. Most but not all High German areas are subject to the change.)
** PG *&quot;sibi&quot; &quot;sieve&quot; &gt; OHG &quot;sib&quot; (cf. Old English &quot;sife&quot;), PG *&quot;gestra&quot; &quot;yesterday&quot; &gt; OHG &quot;gestaron&quot; (cf. OE &quot;ġeostran&quot;, &quot;ġ&quot; being a fricative )
* High German consonant shift: Inherited voiceless plosives are lenited into fricatives and affricates, and voiced fricatives are hardened into plosives and in some cases devoiced.
** Ungeminated post-vocalic , , spirantize intervocalically to , , and elsewhere to , , . Cluster is exempt. Compare Old English &quot;slǣpan&quot; to Old High German &quot;slāfan&quot;.
** Word-initially, after a resonant and when geminated, the same consonants affricatized to , and , OE &quot;tam&quot;: OHG &quot;zam&quot;.
*** Spread of &gt; is geographically very limited and is not reflected in Modern Standard German.
** , and are devoiced.
*** In Standard German, that applies to in all positions but to and only when they are geminated. PG *brugjo &gt; *bruggo &gt; &quot;brucca&quot;, but *leugan &gt; &quot;leggen&quot;.
* (*&quot;ē²&quot;) and are diphthongized into and , respectively.
* Proto-Germanic became except before , , and word-finally, when it monophthongizes into ê, which is also the reflex of unstressed .

==Morphology==

===Verbs===
====Tense====
Germanic had a simple two-tense system, with forms for a present and preterite. These were inherited by Old High German, but in addition OHG developed three periphrastic tenses: the perfect, pluperfect and future.

The periphrastic past tenses were formed by combining the present or preterite of an auxiliary verb (&quot;wësan&quot;, &quot;habēn&quot;) with the past participle. Initially the past participle retained its original function as an adjective and showed case and gender endings - for intransitive verbs the nominative, for transitive verbs the accusative. For example:
&quot;After thie thö argangana warun ahtu taga&quot; (Tatian, 7,1)
&quot;When eight days had passed&quot;, literally &quot;After that then gone-by were eight days&quot;
Latin: &quot;Et postquam consummati sunt dies octo&quot; (Luke 2:21)

&quot;phīgboum habeta sum giflanzotan&quot; (Tatian 102,2)
&quot;There was a fig tree that some man had planted&quot;, literally &quot;Fig-tree had certain (&quot;or&quot; someone) planted&quot;
Latin: &quot;arborem fici habebat quidam plantatam&quot; (Luke 13:6)

In time, however, these endings fell out of use and the participle came to be seen no longer as an adjective but as part of the verb, as in Modern German. This development is taken to be arising from a need to render Medieval Latin forms, but parallels in other Germanic languages (particularly Gothic, where the Biblical texts were translated from Greek, not Latin) raise the possibility that it was an independent development.

Germanic also had no future tense, but again OHG created periphrastic forms, using an auxiliary verb &quot;skulan&quot; (Modern German &quot;sollen&quot;) and the infinitive, or &quot;werden&quot; and the present participle:

&quot;Thu scalt beran einan alawaltenden&quot; (Otfrid&#x27;s Evangelienbuch I, 5,23)
&quot;You shall bear an almighty one&quot;

&quot;Inti nu uuirdist thu suigenti&quot;&#x27; (Tatian 2,9)
&quot;And now you will start to fall silent&quot;
Latin: &quot;Et ecce eris tacens&quot; (Luke 1:20)
The present tense continued to be used alongside these new forms to indicate future time (as it still is in Modern German).

====Conjugation====
The following is a sample conjugation of a strong verb, &quot;nëman&quot; &quot;to take&quot;.

===Personal pronouns===
==Syntax==
Any description of OHG syntax faces a fundamental problem: texts translated from or based on a Latin original will be syntactically influenced by their source, while the verse works may show patterns that are determined by the needs of rhyme and metre, or that represent literary archaisms. Nonetheless, the basic word order rules are broadly those of Modern Standard German.

Two differences from the modern language are the possibility of omitting a subject pronoun and lack of definite and indefinite articles. Both features are exemplified in the start of the 8th century Alemannic creed from St Gall: (Modern German, ; English &quot;I believe in God the almighty father&quot;).

By the end of the OHG period, however, use of a subject pronoun has become obligatory, while the definite article has developed from the original demonstrative pronoun () and the numeral (&quot;one&quot;) has come into use as an indefinite article. These developments are generally seen as mechanisms to compensate for the loss of morphological distinctions which resulted from the weakening of unstressed vowels in the endings of nouns and verbs (see above).

==Texts==

The early part of the period saw considerable missionary activity, and by 800 the whole of the Frankish Empire had, in principle, been Christianized. All the manuscripts which contain Old High German texts were written in ecclesiastical scriptoria by scribes whose main task was writing in Latin rather than German. Consequently, the majority of Old High German texts are religious in nature and show strong influence of ecclesiastical Latin on the vocabulary. In fact, most surviving prose texts are translations of Latin originals. Even secular works such as the are often preserved only because they were written on spare sheets in religious codices.

The earliest Old High German text is generally taken to be the Abrogans, a Latin–Old High German glossary variously dated between 750 and 780, probably from Reichenau. The 8th century Merseburg Incantations are the only remnant of pre-Christian German literature. The earliest texts not dependent on Latin originals would seem to be the and the Wessobrunn Prayer, both recorded in manuscripts of the early 9th century, though the texts are assumed to derive from earlier copies.

The Bavarian &quot;Muspilli&quot; is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition. Other important works are the (Gospel harmony) of Otfrid von Weissenburg, the and the 9th century . The boundary to Early Middle High German (from ) is not clear-cut.

An example of Early Middle High German literature is the .

==Example texts==
The Lord&#x27;s Prayer is given in four Old High German dialects below. Because these are translations of a liturgical text, they are best not regarded as examples of idiomatic language, but they do show dialect variation very clearly.

<text>The Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival and Taipei Golden Horse Awards () are a film festival and associated awards ceremony held annually in Taiwan. The festival and ceremony were founded in 1962 by the Government Information Office of the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan and is now run as an independent organisation. The awards ceremony is usually held in November or December in Taipei, although the event has also been held in other locations in Taiwan in recent times.

==Overview==
Since 1990 (the 27th awards ceremony), the festival and awards has been organized and funded by the Motion Picture Development Foundation R.O.C., which set up the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival Executive Committee. The Committee consists of nine to fifteen film scholars and film scholars on the executive board, which includes the Chairman and CEO. Under the Committee, there are five different departments: the administration department for internal administrative affairs, guest hospitality and cross-industry collaboration; the marketing department which is responsible for event planning and promotion, advertising and publications; the project promotion department attending to the execution of the project meetings; the competition department which is in charge of the competition and awards ceremony; and the festival department which is devoted to festival planning, curation of films and invitation of filmmakers, subtitle transition and production and all on-site arrangements during the festival.

The awards ceremony is Taiwan’s equivalent to the Academy Awards, and was considered among the most prestigious film awards in the Chinese-speaking world for decades until the mainland Chinese boycott in 2019. The awards are contested by Chinese-language submissions from Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and elsewhere. It is one of the four major Chinese-language film awards, along with Hong Kong Film Award, Golden Rooster Awards and Hundred Flowers Awards, also among the most prestigious and respected film awards in the Chinese-speaking film industry. It is also one of the major annual awards presented in Taiwan along with Golden Bell Awards for television production and Golden Melody Awards for music.

The Golden Horse awards ceremony is held after a month-long festival showcasing some of the nominated feature films for the awards. A substantial number of the film winners in the history of the awards have been Hong Kong productions. The submission period is usually around July to August each year and nominations are announced around October with the ceremony held in November or December. Although it has been held once a year; however, it was stopped in 1964 and 1974 and boycotted in the after-ceremony in 2018. Winners are selected by a jury of judges and awarded a Golden Horse statuette during the broadcast ceremony.

==History==
In May 1962, the Government Information Office of the Republic of China (ROC) enacted the &quot;Mandarin Film Award Regulation of Year 1962&quot; to officially found the Golden Horse Awards. The name &quot;Golden Horse&quot; () is a common political term that originates from the islands of Kinmen, Quemoy, or &quot;the Golden Gate&quot; ( ) and Matsu or &quot;the Ancestral Horse&quot;( ), which are under ROC control. The reasons were purely political, as these islands were ROC offshore islands that protected them from the mainland, and were heavily fortified during the Cold War. This was to imply the ROC&#x27;s sovereignty over territories controlled by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The awards ceremony was established to boost the Chinese-language film industry and to award outstanding Chinese-language films and filmmakers. It is one of the most prestigious awards in the film industry in Asia. It has been helping the development of movies in Chinese as it provides great support and encouragement to the filmmakers. Moreover, it intends to introduce excellent films to Taiwanese audience from around the world to stimulate exchange of ideas and inspire creativity.

In 2019, the China Film Administration prohibited mainland Chinese films and filmmakers from participating in the Golden Horse awards, due to political tensions stemming from a Taiwanese filmmaker&#x27;s award acceptance speech advocating for Taiwan&#x27;s independence in the previous year. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV cited this incident from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony as the reason for the ban. Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee, who was the Golden Horse Awards Committee’s chairman, commented on the situation, highlighting how politics can negatively impact the arts. Subsequently, Hong Kong director Johnnie To resigned as the jury president for the 2019 Golden Horse Awards citing prior film production commitments as the reason for his resignation.

==Entries and eligibility==
The awards ceremony pays attention not only to commercial movies but also to artistic films and documentaries. There has been some criticism of this from those who believe that this will not help the Taiwanese commercial movie industry much. However, the awards ceremony plays a significant role in helping the movie industry and drawing more people’s attention to Chinese-language movies.

Under current regulations, any film made primarily in the Chinese language is eligible for competition. Since 1996, a liberalization act allows for films from mainland China to enter the Awards. Several awards have been given to mainland Chinese artists and films, including Jiang Wen&#x27;s &quot;In the Heat of the Sun&quot; in 1996, Best Actor for Xia Yu in 1996, Joan Chen&#x27;s &quot;Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl&quot; in 1999, Best Actress for Qin Hailu in 2001 and Lu Chuan&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 2004.

==Hosts==
For the first fourteen award ceremonies, there were no regular hosts for the ceremony. Hosts began since the fifteenth ceremony; that year&#x27;s hosts were Ivy Ling Po and Wang Hao. Since then, there are usually two hosts every year, sometimes with a combination of one host from Hong Kong and the other from Taiwan. A significant number of celebrities have hosted the ceremony, such as Jackie Chan, Eric Tsang, Kevin Tsai and Dee Hsu. In 2012 (the 49th awards ceremony), Bowie Tsang and Huang Bo were the hosts and Huang Bo became the first host from Mainland China in the history of the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards.

<doc id="429492" wikidata="Q7318763" url="?curid=429492" title="Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)">
<text>The Revolutionary Communist Party, known as the Revolutionary Communist Tendency until 1981, claimed to be a Trotskyist political organisation formed in 1978. From 1988 it published the journal &quot;Living Marxism&quot;. It started with only a few dozen supporters; its membership peaked at 200 in the mid-1990s.

After 1991, the party abandoned Trotskyism and mainstream leftism before publicly taking a libertarian position. It was disbanded in 1997, although a number of former members maintain a loose political network to promote its ideas.

== Beginnings ==

The party originated as a tendency in the Revolutionary Communist Group which had split from the International Socialists in the 1970s. This group had concluded that there was no living Marxist tradition in the left and Marxism would have to be re-established. The RCG saw the British working class and especially the labour movement as dominated by bourgeois ideology and chauvinist nationalism, and the IS as pandering to its low-level trade union consciousness and economism; they asserted that a purer vanguard party was needed, focusing on anti-imperialism rather than trade unionism.

Disagreements about the course the Revolutionary Communist Group should take in relation to support for the Anti-Apartheid Movement and the African National Congress led Frank Furedi, a sociologist at the University of Kent (better known then by his cadre name Frank Richards), to break off and form his own group in 1978. The Revolutionary Communist Tendency (RCT) hoped to draw together those militant working class leaders who were disappointed by the limitations of reformism to help to build a new working class leadership and develop an independent working class programme. The RCT renamed itself the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1981.

== Stance ==
Taking a strong line which it considered to be inspired by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s work on the relationship between imperialism and reformism, the party originally held that the &quot;only hope of securing any decent sort of life - or even guaranteeing survival - lies in the working class taking control over society&quot;. It further argued that traditional Stalinist and social democratic appeals to the bourgeois state had undermined working-class independence and that as a result an independent vanguard party should be organized to campaign for a distinctly working-class politics. In 1978, for example, when the left was strong within the Labour Party, the RCP argued that &quot;Labour is the party which attempts to resolve the crisis by integrating militant working class resistance into the capitalist system&quot;. This position included a rejection of support for the Labour Party and one that questioned the allegiances of the trade union movement. A consequence of this belief was a growing distrust of traditional statist left-wing struggles as reformist. According to some, the RCP took a view that reformism consolidated bourgeois ideology in the potential leadership layers of the working class. The RCP took a number of positions coined to distinguish independent working-class politics from statist reformism which included:
* The rejection of all controls on immigration.
* Opposition to any national economic recovery strategies, such as import controls, which aimed to pit British workers against those overseas.
* Free abortion and contraception on demand.
* Decriminalisation of homosexuality and complete equality under the law.
* Unconditional support for the struggle against British imperialism in Northern Ireland on the grounds that &quot;British workers cannot ignore the cause of Irish liberation without renouncing their own class interests&quot;.
* A claim that the police occupied Brixton: &quot;We have to organise on the streets and housing estates to keep the police out&quot;.
* Opposition to no platforming fascists, but, through the campaign Workers Against Racism, aiming to organise physical defence against racist attacks.

The party&#x27;s programme can be traced through the publications &quot;Our Tasks and Methods&quot; (a reprint of the Revolutionary Communist Group&#x27;s founding document), the 1983 general election manifesto &quot;Preparing for Power&quot; and the article &quot;The Road to Power&quot; in the theoretical journal &quot;Confrontation&quot; (1986).

Historian Evan Smith suggests that there has been a debate about whether the RCP was part of the left. Frank Furedi later described the party&#x27;s approach: “We tried to transcend the left-right divide. Lots of left-wingers said we were not really left-wing because we did not speak their language. We wanted to have an experimental approach and not repeat the problems of the past.” Andy Beckett of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: Despite its name, most of its stances were not communist or revolutionary but contrarian: it supported free speech for racists, and nuclear power; it attacked environmentalism and the NHS. Its most consistent impulse was to invoke an idealised working class, and claim it was actually being harmed by the supposed elites of the liberal left.

==Front groups and campaigns==
According to historian Evan Smith,The RCT/RCP formed several front groups around single issues during the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the most prominent being the Irish Freedom Movement (which had begun as the Smash the Prevention of Terrorism Act Campaign) and Workers Against Racism (originally East London Workers Against Racism). SPTAC and ELWAR were both set up to rival the alleged chauvinism of the British left and larger campaign organisations around the issues of Irish solidarity and anti-racism, such as the Troops Out Movement and the Anti-Nazi League. From the beginning, it seemed that the RCT/RCP was more comfortable directing its own single-issue groups than joining other larger campaign groups.

===Workers Against Racism ===
Beginning as East London Workers Against Racism (ELWAR) before it was launched as a national campaign, Workers Against Racism campaigned against state racism. Protests were organised against deportations and passport checks at hospitals and unemployment benefit offices. ELWAR also organised patrols and vigils to defend immigrants against racist attacks. In Parliament, Conservative MP Nicholas Winterton demanded of the Home Secretary &quot;if he will seek to proscribe the East London Workers against Racism vigilante group&quot;. Workers Against Racism was criticised in the press for its activities during the 1981 Brixton riots. An internal Home Office report to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher claimed: [T]he Revolutionary Communist Party set up a Lambeth Unemployed Workers&#x27; Group shortly before the Riots, and has since formed a South London Workers Against Racism group, similar to the East London Workers Against Racism which attracted some notoriety for organising vigilante patrols.

=== Anti-deportation campaigns ===

The party&#x27;s Workers Against Racism campaign fought many deportation threats, like George Roucou&#x27;s, on the grounds that British immigration law was racist. Roucou was a shop steward in the building workers&#x27; union UCATT in Manchester. Workers Against Racism helped to organise a campaign culminating in a one-day strike and demonstration by his fellow council workers on 6 February 1987. On 13 March 1987, with 500 protesting outside, the Home Office appeal panel reversed Roucou&#x27;s deportation order. On 11 June 1985, Metso Moncrieffe was arrested and held by police pending a deportation order. Workers Against Racism campaigners raised the case, disrupting a test match at the Edgbaston cricket ground in July 1985 with a Metso Must Stay banner and helping to build a 1,000-strong march for him in December 1986. In September 1987, Moncrieffe&#x27;s deportation order was overturned.

=== Supporting Irish republicanism ===
Supporting Irish republicanism was central to the work of the party. According to historian Jack Hepworth, &quot;Advocating ‘unconditional support’ [for the IRA] enabled the RCP to challenge reformism on the British left and nationalism in the labour movement.&quot;

In 1978, the RCP organised the Smash the Prevention of Terrorism Act Campaign and held protests outside police stations where suspects were held. The party organised a conference of trade unionists opposed to Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom in Coventry in 1981 and later that year held a march to the TUC conference, the Workers March for Irish Freedom. On Saturday 6 February 1982, the Irish Freedom Movement (IFM) was founded at a meeting in Caxton House, Archway and TUC general secretary Len Murray wrote to the thirteen trades councils that sponsored the conference threatening them with disaffiliation if they attended. RCP Political Committee member Mick Hume, who edited &quot;The Next Step&quot;, recalls that the IFM were accused of complicity in the 1984 bombing of the Conservative Party conference. The IFM published a quarterly bulletin &quot;Irish Freedom&quot; and organised an annual march on the anniversary of internment. When the voices of Sinn Féin supporters were banned from the British broadcast media, &quot;Living Marxism&quot; carried a front page interview with its leader Gerry Adams and the IFM picketed Broadcasting House. After the Brighton bombing, an RCP editorial in &quot;the next step&quot; said:We support unconditionally the right of the Irish people to carry out their struggle for national liberation in whatever way they choose. We neither support nor condemn any particular tactic the republican movement pursues, whether it is an electoral campaign or a bombing campaign.
Similarly, after the Enniskillen bombing in 1987, Hume reiterated that British radicals’ responses could &quot;not be based on emotional revulsion at particular incidents of violence or terror&quot;.

By the end of the 1980s, according to historian Jack Hepworth, &quot;the IFM was the largest radical solidarity movement in Britain, with an annual August march in London typically attracting an estimated 3,000 demonstrators&quot; and an activist base beyond the party faithful; by 1990 it had twenty branches in the UK.

===Student politics===
The party primarily recruited amongst students. By 1984, it had 45 university and polytechnic branches.

===Electoral involvement===
The RCP stood candidates in the May 1981 local elections, under its own name and that of ELWAR. It stood a candidate in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election, its campaign mainly consisting of heckling Labour candidate Peter Tatchell, who lost the seat to the Liberal Party; the RCP candidate received 38 votes. It fielded four candidates in the 1983 United Kingdom general election, who achieved a total vote of nearly 1000. In 1983, the party began its annual &quot;Preparing for Power&quot; public conferences. In 1986, it launched a new theoretical journal, &quot;Confrontation&quot;. In the 1986 United Kingdom local elections, the RCP stood 38 candidates, including Claire Fox (under the name Claire Foster), who received a total of just under 2300 votes, with an average of 60 votes each. In the 1986 Knowsley North by-election, its candidate was also backed by the Workers Revolutionary Party and received 664 votes, its highest so far. In the 1987 Greenwich by-election, its candidate received 91 votes.

In 1987, it launched the Red Front electoral coalition, appealing to other anti-Labour groups to join it. Its manifesto demanded work or full pay, the defence of trade union rights, equal rights for all, and opposition to war. It had a libertarian flavour and also argued that &quot;The dangers from Aids have in fact been grossly exaggerated. The principal threat to homosexuals in Britain today is not from Aids, but from the safe sex campaign.&quot; Two other groups joined the campaign: Red Action and the Revolutionary Democratic Group. The Front stood 14 candidates, including Kenan Malik. The candidate in Knowsley North achieved 538 vote (1.37%); the others between 111 and 300. It stood its own candidates in the 1989 Glasgow Central by-election and 1989 Vauxhall by-election, receiving 141 and 171 votes respectively.

=== Campaign Against Militarism ===

In 1993, the party helped launch the Campaign Against Militarism (CAM) to fight against western military intervention. CAM organised protests against the military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia and Iraq. On 10 September 1993, seventy Somalis and CAM supporters occupied the United States embassy after an alleged massacre of civilians in Mogadishu, the only time it has happened. After they were evicted by armed marines, eleven were convicted under the as yet untested criminal trespass laws, but charges were dropped after lawyer Mike Fisher sought to have the case tried in the United States, arguing that the offence, if any, was committed on American soil. CAM was the only left-wing group that joined British Serbs in their demonstrations over the military strikes on Yugoslavia in 1994.

In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; Mike Freeman identified &quot;the metamorphosis of what had long regarded itself as a peace movement into a war movement&quot; after Labour rallied to support the First Iraq War. Later, this trend was called &quot;humanitarian imperialism&quot; in &quot;Living Marxism.&quot; The party opposed Western military intervention in Bosnia, Somalia, Kosovo, Iraq and East Timor.

== Controversial positions ==
The party took a number of positions that were strongly criticised by others on the left:
* In &quot;The Truth About the AIDS Panic,&quot; Michael Fitzpatrick and Don Milligan wrote that there is &quot;no good evidence that Aids is likely to spread rapidly among heterosexuals in the West&quot;. The pamphlet argued that the government campaign warning of a heterosexual aids epidemic was a moral panic that would worsen prejudice against gay people.
* When British miners struck against redundancies in 1984, the party argued that the union&#x27;s refusal to hold a national ballot was a major problem: &quot;The only way to win the passive majority for the strike was to launch an aggressive campaign around a national ballot&quot;.
* In the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa, the party argued that &quot;sanctions don&#x27;t make sense&quot; because it was wrong to call on the governments that had supported Apartheid to overthrow it. Rather, workers ought to &quot;take direct action&quot;, like blocking South African imports at docks.

When the organisation re-thought its outlook in 1991, it adopted a number of positions that put it at odds with the New Labour milieu:
* &quot;Living Marxism&quot; argued against what it called the &quot;new authoritarianism&quot;, the greater official interference and surveillance of ordinary people by the state. The growth in &quot;at-risk&quot; registers and CCTV were examples.
* The party opposed the increase in judicial and other kinds of non-majoritarian overriding of parliament as well as the subordination of parliament to the European Convention on Human Rights.

== Criticism ==
In 1981, Alex Callinicos of the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP) took issue with the party&#x27;s argument that &quot;such issues as racism and Ireland form [...] a vital component of revolutionary propaganda&quot;. Callinicos claimed instead that &quot;if most of the workers involved have reactionary views on questions such as race, the position of women, and so on&quot;, then that was less important than that they were fighting over pay and conditions. Callinicos also called into question the party&#x27;s stress on &quot;the connection between reformism and nationalism&quot;, saying they were &quot;paleo-marxists&quot;. In 1984, the SWP and other left parties denounced the RCP for calling for a national ballot in the miners&#x27; strike.

The party&#x27;s stance on AIDS was widely criticised by the gay rights movement. On 30 June 1990, Simon Watney and Edward King of the group OutRage! kicked over the party&#x27;s stall at the Gay Pride march. Watney criticised Michael Fitzpatrick and Don Milligan for giving credence to the idea that AIDS was a &quot;gay plague&quot; by their insistence that there would be no epidemic amongst heterosexuals in the west. However, OutRage! was divided over the attack.

Nick Cohen, Marko Attila Hoare and Oliver Kamm strongly criticised the party and its former members after the dissolution for opposing the military interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq. Hoare, Cohen and Kamm also rejected Noam Chomsky&#x27;s defence of &quot;Living Marxism&quot; and its coverage of the Bosnian war.

In 1997, environmental journalist George Monbiot argued that the party had undue influence at Channel 4 in an article titled &quot;Marxists found alive in C4&quot; after two of its members contributed to the &quot;Against Nature&quot; television programme, whose director Martin Durkin is also connected to the group. Elsewhere, Monbiot took issue with &quot;Living Marxism&quot; for putting too much stress on freedom as if &quot;there should be no limits to human action, least of all those imposed by &#x27;official and semi-official agencies [...] from the police and the courts to social services, counsellors and censors&#x27;&quot;.

Andy Rowell and Jonathan Matthews of the Norfolk Genetic Information Network criticised the party for championing genetic engineering. Andy Rowell and Bob Burton along with Jonathan Matthews of the Norfolk Genetic Information Network charged &quot;Living Marxism&quot; with a history of attacking the environmental movement.

== Re-orientation and disbandment ==
At the end of the 1980s, the party had moved away from its roots as a Trotskyist organisation, leading some critics to argue that they had abandoned the notion of the class struggle. In 1988, its weekly tabloid newspaper &quot;The Next Step&quot; carried an article arguing that &quot;the disintegration of the official labour movement, and the apparent lack of a left-wing alternative, has consolidated an overwhelmingly defensive mood in the working class&quot;.

In the 1987 general election, party members stood as part of the Red Front, arguing that working people needed to break with the Labour Party, but no Red Front candidate retained their election deposit.

In 1988, the party made &quot;The Next Step&quot; into a bulletin for its supporters. Later that year, a monthly magazine called &quot;Living Marxism&quot; was set up for a wider readership. Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet, the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism. In December 1990, &quot;Living Marxism&quot; ran an article by Furedi, &quot;Midnight in the Century&quot;, which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that &quot;for the time being at least, the working class has no political existence&quot;.

In 1997, the point was put more forcefully: In today&#x27;s circumstances class politics cannot be reinvented, rebuilt, reinvigorated or rescued. Why? Because any dynamic political outlook needs to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness. And contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies cannot be used as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity.

Between 1990 and 1997, the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change (in philosophical language, a &quot;subject&quot; of history) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it. Prefacing a 1996 &quot;Living Marxism&quot; manifesto, Mick Hume argued:Of course [...] we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans complaining about problems like unemployment, exploitation and poverty which continue to scar our society. But that would be to ignore the transformation which has taken place in the political climate [...]. At different times, different issues matter most. Each era has thrown up its own great questions which define which side you are on [...]. [A]t &quot;Living Marxism&quot;, we see our job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism. That is the easy bit. There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics, to counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit of social liberation. [...] [D]ealing with [...] unconventional questions, and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them, is the precondition for making political action possible in our time.
In 1994, the Irish Freedom Movement was dissolved. As the Northern Ireland peace process unfolded, the RCP increasingly turned from unconditional support for the IRA towards scorn at its gradualism and reformism.

In February 1997, shortly after the party disbanded, &quot;Living Marxism&quot; re-branded as &quot;LM&quot;, possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins. Articles in &quot;LM&quot; argued:
* Against support for Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour project in 1997.
* Against &quot;humanitarian interventions&quot; in the Balkans, East Timor and Iraq.
* For freedom of speech and the &quot;right to be offensive&quot;.
* Against the &quot;new authoritarianism&quot; of CCTV cameras, anti-social behaviour orders and anti-harassment laws.
* Against the demonisation of the white working class.

This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide. In December 1995, &quot;LM&quot; carried a report by Fiona Fox from Rwanda which argued: The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term &#x27;genocide&#x27; in Rwanda. It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people, to justify outside interference in the country&#x27;s affairs, and to lend legitimacy to a minority military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers.

&quot;LM&quot; continued to create controversy on a variety of issues, most notably on the British Independent Television News (ITN) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s. The controversy centred on &quot;LM&quot; featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps. The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against &quot;LM&quot; were estimated to total around £1 million. The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers.

== Later organisations ==
Many former members of the party and some of the people who contributed to &quot;LM&quot; magazine continue to be politically active, most notably in the Academy of Ideas (formerly the Institute of Ideas), a think tank led by Claire Fox; the online magazine &quot;Spiked&quot;, initially edited by Mick Hume and later by Brendan O&#x27;Neill; and the Manifesto Club in which a leading figure is Munira Mirza, appointed by Boris Johnson as London&#x27;s Director of Policy for culture, the arts and creative industries, and subsequently as his head of Number 10 policy unit. Other groups produced by former members include Debating Matters, the Young Journalists&#x27; Academy, WorldWrite, Audacity.org, the Modern Movement, and Parents with Attitude. The Battle of Ideas has also been held annually since 2005 by the Academy of Ideas, which has been described as a &quot;refuge&quot; for former RCP members. Some commentators, such as George Monbiot, have pointed to apparent entryist tactics of having jobs and lives used by former RCP members designed to influence mainstream public opinion.

One party member from the 1990s explained in an article in &quot;Spiked&quot;:I never left the RCP: the organisation folded in the mid-Nineties, but few of us actually &#x27;recanted&#x27; our ideas. Instead we resolved to support one another more informally as we pursued our political tradition as individuals, or launched new projects with more general aims that have also engaged people from different traditions, or none. These include &quot;Spiked&quot; and the Institute of Ideas, where I now work. It must be said that this development annoyed our political opponents immensely, and a cursory Google search (try &#x27;LM network&#x27; if you have time to kill) will return a plethora of exposés purporting to show that former members of the RCP are involved in various sinister conspiracies. [...] [T]he impossibility of simply doing away with a school of thought that is no longer attached to an organisation is perhaps what annoys our opponents most of all.

In April 2019, three former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, Claire Fox, James Heartfield and Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, were selected as candidates for Nigel Farage&#x27;s Brexit Party in the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom. Stuart Waiton stood in Dundee West at the 2019 general election, also for the Brexit Party.

<doc id="429495" wikidata="Q454486" url="?curid=429495" title="Frank Furedi">
<text>Frank Furedi (; born 3 May 1947) is a Hungarian-Canadian academic and emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent. He is well known for his work on sociology of fear, education, therapy culture, sociology of knowledge, and what he calls &quot;paranoid parenting&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Furedi&#x27;s family emigrated from Hungary to Canada after the failed 1956 uprising, and he completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in international relations at McGill University. He has lived in Britain since 1969. He completed an MA in African politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, and received a PhD from the University of Kent in 1987 with a thesis on the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. 

==Revolutionary Communist Party and offshoots==
A former student radical, he became involved in left-wing politics in Britain in the 1970s, in particular, as a member of the International Socialists (IS), under the pseudonym Frank Richards. He and others were expelled from the IS in 1973 and formed the Revolutionary Communist Group, then in 1976, he and his followers were expelled from this group and formed the Revolutionary Communist Tendency, refounded in 1978 as the Revolutionary Communist Party.

The RCP was distinguished by its contrarianism, commitment to theoretical elaboration and hostility to state intervention in social life. Among its positions were support for the IRA and Saddam Hussein.

In December 1990, the RCP&#x27;s magazine &quot;Living Marxism&quot; ran an article by Furedi, entitled &quot;Midnight in the Century&quot;, which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that &quot;for the time being at least, the working class has no political existence&quot;. This signalled a re-orientation of the party towards more libertarian positions, its formal dissolution by the end of the decade, and the founding of the web site &quot;Spiked Online&quot; with which Furedi is now associated.

==Academic career==
Furedi&#x27;s academic work was initially devoted to a study of imperialism and race relations. His books on the subject include &quot;The Mau Mau War in Perspective&quot;, &quot;The New Ideology of Imperialism&quot; and &quot;The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race&quot;. In recent years his work has been oriented towards exploring the sociology of risk and low expectations. Furedi is author of several books on this topic, most recently &quot;Wasted: Why Education Isn&#x27;t Educating&quot; (Continuum 2009) and &quot;Invitation to Terror: The Expanding Empire of the Unknown&quot; (Continuum 2007), an analysis of the impact of terrorism post 9/11. His more recent publications, &quot;On Tolerance: A Defence of Moral Independence&quot; (Continuum 2011) and &quot;Authority: A Sociological Introduction&quot; (Cambridge University Press) deal with the inter-related problem of freedom and authority. 

He was, according to research from 2005, the most widely cited sociologist in the UK press. Furedi frequently appears in the media, expressing his view that Western societies have become obsessed with risk. He writes regularly for &quot;Spiked&quot;. He has also written several books on the subject of risk, offering a counterpoint to the analyses of Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, including &quot;Paranoid Parenting&quot;, &quot;Therapy Culture&quot;, and &quot;Culture of Fear&quot;.

Notable PhD students he has supervised include Munira Mirza.

In November 2021, Furedi assumed the post of director of the MCC Brussels centre, an offshoot of the Mathias Corvinus Collegium funded by the ruling Hungarian Fidesz party, citing the need for an alternative to mainstream pro-European think-tanks.

In May 2023, Furedi spoke at the National Conservatism Conference in London on the topic &quot;The War Against National Belonging&quot;.

==Views==
In the 1990s he was actively involved in humanist-focused issues, especially campaigns for free speech. Furedi maintains that society and universities are undergoing a politically driven &#x27;dumbing down&#x27; process which is manifest in society&#x27;s growing inability to understand and assess the meaning of risk. The rise of the environmental and green movements parallels society&#x27;s growing obsession with risk. Furedi also attacks the scientific consensus on global warming, and has criticised the prominent role played by science in policy formation.

In 2008 he criticised opponents of American vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on the &quot;Spiked&quot; website. He claims: &quot;It seems that even fervent advocates of women’s rights will adopt outdated and chauvinistic moral rhetoric when targeting a woman they do not like.&quot;

In 2008 he co-authored a book with Jennie Bristow published by the think tank Civitas titled &quot;Licensed to Hug: How Child Protection Policies Are Poisoning the Relationship Between the Generations and Damaging the Voluntary Sector&quot;, arguing that the growth of police vetting (see Criminal Records Bureau) has created a sense of mistrust and advocating a more common-sense approach to adult/child relations, based on the assumption that the vast majority of adults can be relied on to help and support children, and that the healthy interaction between generations enriches children&#x27;s lives.

==Reception==

=== Praise ===
The philosopher Mary Warnock wrote in 2011 that Furedi is &quot;to be respected in the strongest sense, indeed greatly admired&quot; for his exposure of hypocrisy and intolerance in contemporary culture.

In reviewing Furedi&#x27;s &quot;Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone?&quot; for &quot;The Times&quot; in 2004, the traditional conservative philosopher and writer Roger Scruton said:

=== Criticism ===
Critics of Furedi are drawn from a wide spectrum of left and progressive opinion who criticise as cultish and reactionary the organizations in which he has been a leading figure. Furedi&#x27;s views on race have been described as a &quot;colourblind racism&quot;. George Monbiot has accused Furedi of overseeing extreme right-wing libertarian campaigns &quot;against gun control, against banning tobacco advertising and child pornography, and in favour of global warming, human cloning and freedom for corporations&quot;. Monbiot has also accused him of leading entryism of ex-RCPers into &quot;key roles in the formal infrastructure of public communication used by the science and medical establishment&quot;, to pursue an agenda in favour of genetic engineering. The journalist Nick Cohen has described the RCP as a &quot;weird cult&quot; whose Leninist discipline, disruptive behaviour and selfish publicity-seeking have remained unaltered during the various tactical shifts in the face it presents to the wider world.

==Personal life==
Furedi is married to Ann Furedi. He lives in Faversham, Kent.

<text>The Arbëreshë (; ; ), also known as Albanians of Italy or Italo-Albanians, are an Albanian ethnolinguistic group minority historically settled in Southern and Insular Italy (in the regions of Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania, and Molise, but mostly concentrated in the regions of Calabria and Sicily).

They are the descendants of Albanian refugees settled in the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily who fled from Albania, Epirus, and later some from the numerous Albanian communities of Attica and Morea, between the 14th and the 18th centuries following the death of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg and the gradual conquest of the Balkans by the Ottoman Turks. Their culture is determined by the main features that are found in language, religious rite, traditional costume, art and gastronomy, still zealously preserved, with the awareness of belonging to a specific ethnic group.

Over the centuries, the Arbëreshë have managed to maintain and develop their identities, thanks to their cultural value exercised mainly by the religious communities of the Byzantine Rite.
Nowadays, most of the fifty Arbëreshë communities are adherents to the Italo-Albanian Church, an Eastern Catholic Church. They belong to two eparchies, the Lungro, for the Arbëreshë of Continental Italy, the Piana degli Albanesi, for the Arbëreshë of Sicily, and the Monastery of Grottaferrata of Lazio, whose Basilian monks come largely from the Albanian settlements of Italy. The church is the most important organization for maintaining the characteristic religious, ethnic, linguistic and traditional identity of the Arbëreshë community.

The Arbëreshë speak &quot;Arbërisht&quot;, an old variant of the Albanian language which derives from the Tosk Albanian spoken in central-southern Albania and Epirus. In Italy the Albanian Arbëresh language is protected by law number 482/99, concerning the protection of the historic linguistic minorities.

The Arbëreshë are scattered also in other parts of Italy. They are in great numbers in North and South America, especially in the US, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay and Canada, and in the various parts of central-northern Europe. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 Italo-Albanians (400,000 if including those outside of Italy); they constitute one of the oldest and largest minorities in Italy. When speaking about their &quot;nation&quot;, Arbëresh use the term &quot;Arbëria&quot;, a loose geographical term for the scattered villages in southern Italy which use Arbëresh language.

In the light of historical events, the secular continuity of the Albanian presence in Italy is exceptional. In 2017, an official application for inclusion of the Arbëresh people has been submitted to the UNESCO as a living human and social intangible cultural heritage of humanity by the Government of Albania.

== Distribution ==



The Arbëresh villages maintain two or three names, an Italian one as well as one or two native Arbëresh names by which villagers know the place. The Arbëreshë communities are divided into numerous ethnic islands corresponding to different areas of southern Italy. However, some places have already lost their original characteristics and the language, and others have totally disappeared. Today, Italy has 50 communities of Arbëreshë origin and culture, 41 municipalities and 9 villages, spread across seven regions of southern Italy, forming a population of about 100,000. Some cultural islands survive in the metropolitan areas of Milan, Chieri, Turin, Rome, Naples, Bari, Cosenza, Crotone and Palermo. In the rest of the world, following the migrations of the twentieth century to countries such as Canada, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and the United States, there are strong communities that keep Arbëreshë traditions alive.

=== Community of Albanian origin ===
There are also more than thirty ancient Albanian centers that have lost, in different historical periods and for various reasons, the use of the Albanian language and are thus characterized by a lack of historical and cultural heritage of the Arbëresh: for Emilia-Romagna they are Pievetta and Bosco Tosca, hamlets of Castel San Giovanni (PC); for Lazio it is Pianiano (VT), a hamlet of Cellere; for Molise it is Santa Croce di Magliano (CB); for Campania in the province of Caserta it is Alife; for Puglia they are Casalnuovo Monterotaro, Castelluccio dei Sauri, San Paolo di Civitate (FG), Monteparano, San Giorgio Ionico, San Crispieri, Faggiano, Roccaforzata, Monteiasi, Carosino, Montemesola (TA); for Basilicata they are Brindisi Montagna, Rionero in Vulture (PZ); for Calabria are Cervicati (Çervikat), Mongrassano (Mungrasana), Rota Greca (Rrota), San Lorenzo del Vallo (Sullarënxa &#x27;), Sartano, Serra d&#x27;Aiello (Serrë, CS), Amato, Arietta (Arjèta), fraction of Petronà, Gizzeria (Jacaria) and the hamlets Mortilla (Mortilë) and Gizzeria Lido (Zalli i Jacarisë), Zagarise, Zangarona (Xingarona), fraction of Lamezia Terme, (CZ); for Sicily they are Mezzojuso (Munxifsi), Palazzo Adriano (Pallaci, PA), Sant&#x27;Angelo Muxaro (Shënt&#x27;Ëngjëlli, AG), Biancavilla (Callìcari), Bronte (Brontë), San Michele di Ganzaria (Shën Mikelli, CT).

The communities of Mezzojuso and Palazzo Adriano, in the province of Palermo, are to be considered a particular case, since, despite having lost the Albanian language and the customs of origin, they have kept the Greek-Byzantine rite, a peculiar pillar - together with language and customs - of the Albanian identity of the diaspora. In this case the identity is preserved in the religious aspect and in the historical memory. The communities of Cervicati, Mongrassano and Rota Greca, in the province of Cosenza, preserve the memory of the original cultural heritage.

The Albanian migrations, since the beginning of the long diaspora, led to the formation of medium-small arbëreshe communities well integrated in numerous existing cities of central-northern Italy (in particular, Venice) and in the Crown of Aragon (Naples, Bari, Altamura, Barletta, Andria, Trani, Foggia, Bovino, San Severo, Lecce, Brindisi, Potenza, Matera, Melfi, Caltagirone and Piazza Armerina), in most cases reality - again for different reasons - assimilated by the surrounding culture.

=== Cultural islands, migrations and the modern Albanian diaspora ===
Relevant cultural islands survive in the large metropolitan areas of Milan, Turin, Rome, Naples, Bari, Cosenza, Crotone and Palermo. In the rest of the world, following the migrations of the twentieth century in countries such as Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay there are strong communities that they keep the Arbëreshë language and traditions alive.

Since 1990, with the fall of the post-Bolshevik communist regime in Albania, significant communities of shqiptarë (Albanians of Albania) have entered and integrated into the social fabric of the Italian-Albanian towns. With the struggle for the independence of Kosovo (2008) a very recent group of Albanians, victims of the ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslav regime, has also integrated itself into the various Albanian communities of Italy.

== History ==
=== Ethnonym ===
In the Middle Ages, the native Albanians in the area of Albania called their country &quot;Arbëri&quot; or &quot;Arbëni&quot; and referred to themselves as &quot;Arbëreshë&quot; or &quot;Arbëneshë&quot;. In the sixteenth century, the toponym &quot;Shqipëria&quot; and the demonym &quot;Shqiptarë&quot; gradually replaced &quot;Arbëria&quot; and &quot;Arbëresh&quot; respectively. Nowadays, only the Albanians in Italy, whose ancestors immigrated from the Middle Ages, are called Arbëresh and the language Arbërisht. The term &quot;Arbëreshë&quot; and its variants are also used as endonyms by the Arbanasi in Croatia and Arvanites in Greece.

=== Early migrations ===

The invasion of the Balkans by the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century forced many Arbëreshë to emigrate from Albania and Epirus, Attica, Thebes, Peloponnese then called Morea and other Islands to southern Italy. There were several waves of migrations. In 1448, the King of Naples Alfonso V of Aragon appealed to Skanderbeg to help suppress a revolt at Naples. Skanderbeg sent a force under the leadership of Demetrio Reres, and his two sons. Following a request by the Albanian soldiers, King Alfonso granted them land and they were settled in twelve villages in the mountainous area called Catanzaro in 1448. A year later the sons of Demetrio, George and Basil along with other Albanians were settled in four villages in Sicily.

In 1461, the son of Alfonso, king Ferdinand I of Naples again requested the help of Skanderbeg. This time, the legendary leader himself came to Italy with his troops led by one of his generals, Luca Baffa, to end a French-supported insurrection. Skanderbeg was appointed as the leader of the combined Neapolitan-Albanian army and, after winning two decisive battles, the Albanian soldiers effectively defended Naples. This time they were rewarded with land east of Taranto in Apulia, populating 15 other villages. From the history we know that region of Puglia since 4-5 century BC was inhabited by the Iapygian tribes such as Daunians, Peuceti, and Messapians. Messapic language, according to some researchers, its same like Albanian language. &quot;&quot;bila&quot; means daughter. In region of Vlorë daughter is called the same as the Mesapians called it :&quot;Bila&quot;, in the other regions of Albania is called &quot;Bija&quot;&quot;. 
After the death of Skanderbeg in 1468, the organized Albanian resistance against the Ottomans came to an end. Like much of the Balkans, Albania became subject to the invading Turks. Many of its people under the rule of Luca Baffa and Marco Becci fled to the neighboring countries and settled in a few villages in Calabria. From the time of Skanderbeg&#x27;s death until 1480 there were constant migrations of Albanians to the Italian coast. Throughout the 16th century, these migrations continued and other Albanian villages were formed on Italian soil. The new immigrants often took up work as mercenaries hired by Italian armies.

According to some albanologists, this historiographic tradition was created &quot;ad hoc&quot;, as they believe that the resistance of Skanderbeg against the Turks was not the major factor that produced the Albanian migration to Italy. Indeed, scholars argue that Albanians have migrated from the western Balkans to Italy through several waves since the Middle Ages, even before Skanderbeg&#x27;s period.

Another wave of emigration, between 1500 and 1534, relates to Arbëreshë from central Greece. Employed as mercenaries by Venice, they had to evacuate the colonies of the Peloponnese with the assistance of the troops of Charles V, as the Turks had invaded that region. Charles V established these troops in southern Italy to reinforce defenses against the threat of Turkish invasion. Established in isolated villages (which enabled them to maintain their culture until the 20th century), Arbëreshë were, traditionally, soldiers for the Kingdom of Naples and the Republic of Venice, from the Wars of Religion to the Napoleonic invasion.

=== Later migrations ===

The wave of migration from southern Italy to the Americas in 1900–1910 and 1920–1940 depopulated approximately half of the Arbëreshë villages, and subjected the population to the risk of cultural disappearance, despite the beginning of a cultural and artistic revival in the 19th century.

Since the end of communism in Albania in 1990, there has been a wave of immigration into Arbëreshë villages by Albanians.

== Language ==


Arbëresh derives from the Tosk dialect spoken in southern Albania, and is spoken in Southern Italy in the regions of Calabria, Molise, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania, Abruzzi, and Sicily. All dialects of Arbëresh are closely related to each other.


The Arbëresh language retains many archaisms of medieval Albanian from pre-Ottoman Albania in the 15th century. It also retains some Greek language elements, including vocabulary and pronunciation. It has also preserved some conservative features that were lost in mainstream Albanian Tosk. For example, it has preserved certain syllable-initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in Standard Albanian (cf. Arbërisht &quot;gluhë&quot; (&#x27;language/tongue&#x27;), vs. Standard Albanian &quot;gjuhë&quot; ). It sounds more archaic than Standard Albanian, but is close enough that it is written using the same Albanian alphabet as Standard Albanian. A Shqiptar (Albanian) listening to or reading Arbërisht is similar to a modern English speaker listening to or reading Shakespearean English. The Arbëresh language is of particular interest to students of the modern Albanian language as it represents the sounds, grammar, and vocabulary of pre-Ottoman Albania.

Arbërisht was commonly called (&quot;Albanian&quot; in Italian) in Italy until the 1990s. Until recently, Arbërisht speakers had only very imprecise notions about how related or unrelated their language was to Albanian. Until the 1980s Arbërisht was exclusively a spoken language, except for its written form used in the Italo-Albanian Church, and Arbëreshë people had no practical affiliation with the Standard Albanian language used in Albania, as they did not use this form in writing or in media. When a large number of immigrants from Albania began to enter Italy in the 1990s, they came into contact with local Arbëreshë communities.

Since the 1980s, some efforts have been organized to preserve the cultural and linguistic heritage of the language. Arbërisht has been under a slow decline in recent decades, but is currently experiencing a revival in many villages in Italy. Figures such as Giuseppe Schirò Di Maggio have done much work on school books and other language learning tools in the language, producing two books &quot;Udha e Mbarë&quot; and &quot;Udhëtimi&quot;, both used in schools in the village of Piana degli Albanesi.

Linguists focusing on the language include (Albanian) Eda Derhemi, (diaspora born) Martin Di Maggio as well as (Piana degli Albanesi native) Vito Matranga.

There is no official political, administrative or cultural structure which represents the Arbëresh community. Arbërësh is not one of the group of minority languages that enjoy the special protection of the State under Article 6 of the Italian Constitution. At the regional level, however, Arbërisht is accorded some degree of official recognition in the autonomy statutes of Calabria, Basilicata and Molise. 
* In the case of Calabria, the region is to provide for recognition of the historical culture and artistic heritage of the populations of Arbëresh origin and to promote the teaching of the two languages in the places where they are spoken.
* Article 5 of the autonomy statute of Basilicata lays down that the regional authorities &quot;shall promote renewed appreciation of the originality of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the local communities&quot;. 
* Finally, the autonomy statute of the Molise region stipulates that the region &quot;shall be the guardian of the linguistic and historical heritage and of the popular traditions of the ethnic communities existing in its territory and, by agreement with the interested municipalities, shall promote renewed appreciation of them&quot;.
In certain communes the local authorities support cultural and linguistic activities promoted by the Arbëresh communities and have agreed to the erection of bilingual road signs. There are associations that try to protect the culture, particularly in the province of Cosenza. The Arbëresh language is used in some private radios and publications. The fundamental laws of the areas of Molise, Basilicata and Calabria make reference to the Arbëresh language and culture. Nevertheless, the increase in training in the use of the written language has given some hope for the continuity of this culture.

=== Literature ===
==== Early Arbëreshë literature ====

The first work of Italo-Albanian literature was that of Sicilian archpriest Luca Matranga (1567–1619). The book was titled &quot;E mbsuama e krështerë&quot; (Christian Doctrine) and it was a simple religious translation in Arbëresh language, aiming at bringing Christianity closer to his people is Southern Italy. While during the 17th century there were no Arbëresh writers, in the 18th century there was Giulio Variboba (1724–1788, ), regarded by many Albanians as the first genuine poet in all of Albanian literature. Born in San Giorgio Albanese (Mbuzati) and educated in Corsini Seminary in San Benedetto Ullano, after many polemics with local priest he went to exile in Rome in 1761 and there he published in 1762 his long lyric poem &quot;Ghiella e Shën Mëriis Virghiër&quot; (The life of Virgin Mary). The poem has been written entirely in dialect of San Giorgio and has about 4717 lines. Variboba is considered unique in Albanian literature for his poetic sensitivities and the variety of rhythmic expression. Another known artistic figure of that time was Nicola Chetta (1740–1803) known in Albanian as &quot;Nikollë Keta&quot;. As a poet he wrote verses both in Albanian and Greek language and he has also composed the first Albanian sonnet in 1777. Being a poet, lexicographer, linguist, historian, theologian and rector of Greek seminary, his variety and universality of work distinguish him from other writers of the period.
The most prominent figure among Arbëresh writers and the foremost figure of the Albanian nationalist movement in 19th-century Italy was that of Girolamo de Rada (). Born the son of a parish priest of Italo-Albanian Catholic Church in Macchia Albanese () in the mountains of Cosenza, De Rada attended the college of Saint Adrian in San Demetrio Corone. In October 1834, in accordance with his father&#x27;s wishes, he registered at the Faculty of Law of the University of Naples, but the main focus of his interests remained folklore and literature. It was in Naples in 1836 that De Rada published the first edition of his best-known Albanian-language poem, the &quot;Songs of Milosao&quot;, under the Italian title &quot;Poesie albanesi del secolo XV. Canti di Milosao, figlio del despota di Scutari&quot; (Albanian poetry from the 15th century. Songs of Milosao, son of the despot of Shkodra). His second work, &quot;Canti storici albanesi di Serafina Thopia, moglie del principe Nicola Ducagino&quot;, Naples 1839 (Albanian historical songs of Serafina Thopia, wife of prince Nicholas Dukagjini), was seized by the Bourbon authorities because of De Rada&#x27;s alleged affiliation with conspiratorial groups during the Italian Risorgimento. The work was republished under the title &quot;Canti di Serafina Thopia, principessa di Zadrina nel secolo XV&quot;, Naples 1843 (Songs of Serafina Thopia, princess of Zadrina in the 15th century) and in later years in a third version as &quot;Specchio di umano transito, vita di Serafina Thopia, Principessa di Ducagino&quot;, Naples 1897 (Mirror of human transience, life of Serafina Thopia, princess of Dukagjin). His Italian-language historical tragedy &quot;I Numidi&quot;, Naples 1846 (The Numidians), elaborated half a century later as &quot;Sofonisba, dramma storico&quot;, Naples 1892 (Sofonisba, historical drama), enjoyed only modest public response. In the revolutionary year 1848, De Rada founded the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Albanese d&#x27;Italia&quot; (The Albanian of Italy) which included articles in Albanian. This bilingual &quot;political, moral and literary journal&quot; with a final circulation of 3,200 copies was the first Albanian-language periodical anywhere.

De Rada was the harbinger and first audible voice of the Romantic movement in Albanian literature, a movement which, inspired by his unfailing energy on behalf of national awakening among Albanians in Italy and in the Balkans, was to evolve into the romantic nationalism characteristic of the Rilindja period in Albania. His journalistic, literary and political activities were instrumental not only in fostering an awareness for the Arbëresh minority in Italy but also in laying the foundations for an Albanian national literature.

The most popular of his literary works is the above-mentioned &quot;Canti di Milosao&quot; (Songs of Milosao), known in Albanian as &quot;Këngët e Milosaos&quot;, a long romantic ballad portraying the love of Milosao, a fictitious young nobleman in fifteenth-century Shkodra (Scutari), who has returned home from Thessalonica. Here, at the village fountain, he encounters and falls in love with Rina, the daughter of the shepherd Kollogre. The difference in social standing between the lovers long impedes their union until an earthquake destroys both the city and all semblance of class distinction. After their marriage abroad, a child is born. But the period of marital bliss does not last long. Milosao&#x27;s son and wife soon die, and he himself, wounded in battle, perishes on a riverbank within sight of Shkodra.

== Religion ==
=== The Italo-Albanian Church ===
The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, particular church &quot;sui iuris&quot;, includes three ecclesiastical jurisdictions: the Eparchy of Lungro degli Italo-Albanesi for the Albanians of Southern Italy based in Lungro (CS); the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi for Albanians of Insular Italy based in Piana degli Albanesi (PA); the Territorial Abbacy of Santa Maria of Grottaferrata, with Basilian monks (O.S.B.I.) come from the Italo-Albanian communities, located in the only abbey and abbey church in Grottaferrata (RM).

The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church being a Byzantine enclave in the Latin West, is secularly inclined to ecumenism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was the only abode of eastern Christianity from the end of the Middle Ages until the twentieth century in Italy.

There are institutions and religious congregations of the Byzantine rite in the territory of the Italo-Albanian Church: the Basilian Order of Grottaferrata, the Collegine Sisters of Sacra Famiglia, Piccole operaie dei Sacri Cuori and the congregation of the Basilian Sisters Daughters of Saint Macrina.

== Culture ==
=== Traditions and folklore ===
Among the Arbëreshë the memory of Skanderbeg and his exploits was maintained and survived through songs, in the form of a Skanderbeg cycle.

Arbëreshë people have preserved their Albanian traditinal dances (&quot;vallje&quot;), including the Albanian sword dance.

=== Gjitonía ===

&quot;Gjitonia&quot; is a form of neighbourhood typical of Arbëresh communities and widespread throughout the Arbëresh people. It comes from the Greek (geitonía). The Gjitonía functions as a microsystem around which the life of the &quot;horë&quot; (village) revolves; the Gjitonía is a smaller-scale version of the layout of the village often consisting of a small square towards which the alleys are oriented, surrounded by buildings that have openings towards a larger square (&quot;&quot;) on diagonal angles. The name is usually taken from the families that live there.
The social aspect of the Gjitonía is an ancient and historical structure where values of hospitality and solidarity between the families of the neighbourhood coexisted and where there was no difference of social class. Mainly for the Italian-Albanian communities, it is a world where relationships were so strong that they created real family relationships so much so that the Arbëreshe phrase &quot;Gjitoni gjirì&quot; (&quot;neighbourhood relatives&quot;) is typical.

===Cuisine===



The Arbëreshë cuisine is composed of the cuisines of Albania and Italy. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their Albanian origins to a mixed cuisine of Sicilian, Calabrian, and Lucanian influences.

These traditional dishes are Piana degli Albanesi (Palermo, Sicily):

* Strangujët – A form of Gnocchi called Strangujtë made with flour by hand, flavoured with tomato sauce (&quot;lënk&quot;) and basil. Traditionally this dish was consumed by families seated around a floor level table of wood (&quot;zbrilla&quot;) on 14 September, the &quot;Festa e Kryqit Shejt&quot; (Exaltation of the Cross).
* Grurët – Boiled wheat dish flavored with olive oil, known as cuccìa in the Sicilian language. The tradition is to eat it on Festa e Sënda Lluçisë. Variations are the use of sweetened milk or ricotta with flakes of chocolate, orange peel and almonds.
* Kanojët – Cannoli, the universally famous Pianotto sweet pastry. Its culinary secret is waffle (&quot;shkorça&quot;) of flour, wine, lard and salt and filled with sweetened ricotta, and lastly sprinkled with sieved chocolate.
* Bukë – Arbëresh bread (&quot;bukë&quot;) is prepared with local hard grain flour and manufactured to a round and mostly leavened shape with natural methods. It is cooked in antique firewood furnaces (Tandoor). It is eaten warm flavored with olive oil (&quot;vaj i ullirit&quot;) and dusted with cheese or with fresh ricotta.
* Panaret – Arbëresh Easter bread shaped either into a circle or into two large braids and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It is adorned with red Easter eggs. The Easter eggs are dyed deep red to represent the blood of Christ, the eggs also represent new life and springtime. It is traditionally eaten during the Resurrection Meal. After 40 days of fasting, as per the Byzantine Catholic tradition, the Easter feast has to begin slowly, with a light meal after the midnight liturgy on Saturday night. The fast is generally broken with panaret.
* Loshkat and Petullat – Sweetened spherical or crushed shaped fried leavened dough. Eaten on the eve of E Mart e Madh Carnival.
* Të plotit – A sweet cake in various shaped with fig marmalade filling, one of the oldest Arbëresh dishes.
* Milanisë – Traditionally eaten on the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day (&quot;Festa e Shën Zefit&quot;) and Good Friday, is a pasta dish made with a sauce (&quot;lënk&quot;) of wild fennel paste, sardines and pine nuts.
* Udhose and Gjizë – Homemade cheese and ricotta normally dried outdoors.
* Likëngë – Pork sausages flavored with salt, pepper and seed of Fennel (farë mbrai).
* Llapsana – Forest Brussels sprout (llapsana) fried with garlic and oil.
* Dorëzët – Very thin home-made semolina spaghetti, cooked in milk and eaten on Ascension Day.
* Groshët – Soup made of fava beans, chickpeas and haricot beans.
* Verdhët – During Easter a kind of pie is prepared with eggs, lamb, ricotta, sheep cheese and (previously boiled) leaf stalks of golden thistle; in some villages, the young aerial parts of wild fennel are used instead.

==Physical appearance==
A study from 1918 included 59 Arbëreshë men from Cosenza, Calabria, the result showed that fair hair was present in 27% of them. The same study also showed that the frequencies of light eyes and white skin, were 47% and 67% respectively. The Arbëreshë, from this survey, are found to be overall less pigmented than the Calabrians. They are also taller (m. 1.64) and less dolichocephalic (cephalic index 80.6).

== Genetics ==
According to Sarno et al. 2015 there are many Y-DNA haplogroups present among Arbëreshë. Those haplogroups are also shared with their Italian and Balkan neighbours. Arbereshë appear as slightly differentiated from native Southern Italians, and instead overlap with the other Southern Balkan populations of Albania and Kosovo.

<text>Decimus Burton (30 September 1800 – 14 December 1881) was one of the foremost English architects and landscapers of the 19th century. He was the foremost Victorian architect in the Roman revival, Greek revival, Georgian neoclassical and Regency styles. He was a founding fellow and vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and from 1840 architect to the Royal Botanic Society, and an early member of the Athenaeum Club, London, whose clubhouse he designed and which the company of his father, James Burton, the pre-eminent Georgian London property developer, built.

Burton&#x27;s works are Hyde Park, London (including the gate or screen of Hyde Park Corner, the Wellington Arch, and the Gates); Green Park and St James&#x27;s Park; Regent&#x27;s Park (including Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Clarence Terrace, Chester Terrace, and the villas of the Inner Circle which include his own mansion, The Holme, and the original Winfield House); the enclosure of the forecourt of Buckingham Palace from which he had Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch moved; the clubhouse of the Athenaeum Club, London; Carlton House Terrace; Spring Gardens in St. James&#x27;s; and the Palm House and the Temperate House at Kew Gardens. Burton designed the seaside towns of St Leonards-on-Sea, Fleetwood, and Folkestone, and also Royal Tunbridge Wells. His Calverley Estate (of which only a small proportion survives) was highly commended.

Burton was a member of London high society during the Georgian era and during the Regency era. He had close friendships with Princess Victoria (the future Queen Victoria); the Duchess of Kent; William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, John Wilson Croker, and Sir Humphry Davy. The Burtons&#x27; London mansion, The Holme of Regent&#x27;s Park, which was built by James&#x27;s company to a design by his son Decimus Burton, was described by 20th century architectural critic Ian Nairn as &#x27;a definition of Western civilization in a single view&#x27;. Burton also contributed to the design of their Tonbridge, Kent mansion, Mabledon.

==Family==
Decimus was the tenth child of James Burton, a pre-eminent London property developer (1761–1837), and Elizabeth Westley (12 December 1761 – 14 January 1837), of Loughton, Essex, the daughter of John and Mary Westley. His father was born James Haliburton, and shortened his surname to Burton in 1794, between the births of his fourth and fifth children. The paternal grandfather was William Haliburton (1731–1785), a London property developer of Scottish descent. 

On his father&#x27;s side, Decimus&#x27;s great-great grandparents were Rev. James Haliburton (1681–1756) and Margaret Eliott, daughter of Sir William Eliott, 2nd Baronet, and aunt of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield. Decimus was descended from John Haliburton (1573–1627), from whom Sir Walter Scott was descended on the maternal side. Burton was a cousin of the Canadian author and British Tory MP Thomas Chandler Haliburton and of the British civil servant Lord Haliburton, who was the first native Canadian to be raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 

Decimus&#x27;s siblings included the Egyptologist James Burton, and the physician Henry Burton. He was the nephew of Constance Mary Fearon, who was the founder of the Francis Bacon Society.

==Education and architectural style==
Decimus was born at the &#x27;very comfortable and well staffed&#x27; North House in the newly built Southampton Terrace, Bloomsbury, London. From 1805, Decimus was raised in his father&#x27;s mansion, Mabledon House, in Kent. Subsequent to the birth of his twelfth child, Jessy, in 1804, Decimus&#x27;s father James Burton had purchased a site on a hill about one mile to the south of Tonbridge in Kent, where he constructed, to the designs of the architect Joseph T. Parkinson, in 1805, the large country mansion which he named Mabledon House, which was described in 1810 by the local authority as &#x27;an elegant imitation of an ancient castellated mansion&#x27;. The majority of the stone that James Burton required for Mabledon was quarried from the hill on which it was to be built, but Burton also purchased the stone that had been released by the recent demolition at a nearby mansion, Penshurst Place. Decimus Burton was coincidentally commissioned to expand Mabledon, his childhood home, on several occasions after it had been sold by his father.

===Tuition by his father and George Maddox===
Decimus first trained with his father and received drawing lessons from George Maddox. Decimus&#x27;s father James was a talented architect, in addition to the foremost contemporaneous property developer. Williams says of James Burton, &quot;[He] was no ordinary builder. He could have put up an imposing and beautifully proportioned building, correct in every constructional detail, from the roughest of sketches tossed patronizingly at him by a &#x27;gentleman architect, and &quot;James Burton became adept at relieving the monotony of long residential terraces by allowing their central blocks to project slightly from the surfaces to each side, and by bringing forward, too, the houses at each end&quot;, and that &quot;the ironwork in a classical style in James Burton&#x27;s Bloomsbury terraces was, and often still is, particularly fine, though mass produced&quot;. 

Samuel Pepys Cockerell, advisor to the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, a contemporary of James Burton, commended James Burton&#x27;s architectural excellence: Without such a man, possessed of very considerable talents, unwearied industry, and a capital of his own, the extraordinary success of the improvement of the Foundling Estate could not have taken place... By his own peculiar resources of mind, he has succeeded in disposing of his buildings and rents, under all disadvantages of war, and of an unjust clamour which has repeatedly been raised against him. Mr Burton was ready to come forward with money and personal assistance to relieve and help forward those builders who were unable to proceed in their contracts; and in some instances he has been obliged to resume the undertaking and complete himself what has been weakly and imperfectly proceeded with... 

In 1815, James Burton took Decimus to Hastings, where the two would later design and build St Leonards-on-Sea and, in 1816, Decimus commenced work in James Burton&#x27;s office. While working for his father, Decimus was present in the design and construction of lower Regent Street. Simultaneously, Maddox taught Decimus architectural draughtsmanship, including the details of the five orders. After his first year of tuition by his father and Maddox, Decimus submitted to the Royal Academy of Arts a design for a bridge, which was commended by the academy.

===Tuition at Royal Academy Schools by John Soane===
Burton has been described by Williams as &quot;an exceptionally clever child&quot; who demonstrated a lack of emotion characteristic of his family. Decimus left Tonbridge School in 1816 and entered directly the Royal Academy Schools, in 1817. His contemporaries at the Royal Academy included Sydney Smirke, with whom he would restore Temple Church, London between 1841 and 1843, and William Tite. As a consequence of his father&#x27;s social position, Burton was able to enter the Schools at an unprecedentedly young age, without having been previously articled to an architect. There he was taught by Sir John Soane, for whom his brother, James, had also worked. 

Soane was an advocate of the Neo-Palladian style, but had repudiated, including to his students, Robert Smirke&#x27;s new Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, which had not been built in proportion: Soane used special diagrams to demonstrate to his students, including Burton, the failings of Smirke&#x27;s design, as a consequence of which he was ostracized within the Royal Academy and compelled to suspend his lectures. Soane commended, in contradistinction, in 1815, as an archetype of neoclassical excellence, Robert Adam&#x27;s Kedleston Hall: &quot;In this superb structure he [Adam] has united... the taste and magnificence of a Roman villa with all the comforts and conveniences of an English Nobleman&#x27;s residence&quot;.

===Tuition by John Nash===
Whereas Decimus&#x27;s father James Burton was vigorously industrious, and had become &#x27;most gratifyingly rich&#x27;, John Nash&#x27;s early years in private practice, and his first speculative developments, which failed either to sell or let, were unsuccessful, and his consequent financial shortage was exacerbated by the &#x27;crazily extravagant&#x27; wife whom he had married before he had completed his training, until he was declared bankrupt in 1783. To resolve his financial shortage, Nash cultivated the acquaintance of James Burton, who consented to patronize him. James Burton was responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of Nash&#x27;s London designs, in addition to for their construction, and Decimus became acquainted with Nash through his father. 

Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written, &#x27;John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises. Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style... John Nash needed the son&#x27;s aid, as well as the father&#x27;s&#x27;. Subsequent to the Crown Estate&#x27;s refusal to finance them, James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of John Nash at Regent&#x27;s Park, which he had already been commissioned to construct. In return, Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton. Nash was a vehement advocate of the neoclassical revival endorsed by Soane, although he had lost interest in the plain stone edifices typical of the Georgian style, and instead advocated the use of stucco. Decimus Burton entered the office of Nash in 1815, where he worked alongside Augustus Charles Pugin, who detested the neoclassical style. Decimus established his own architectural practice in 1821. 

In 1821, Nash invited Decimus to design Cornwall Terrace in Regent&#x27;s Park, and Decimus was also invited by George Bellas Greenough, a close friend of the Prince Regent, Humphry Davy, and Nash, to design Grove House in Regent&#x27;s Park. Greenough&#x27;s invitation to Decimus Burton was &#x27;virtually a family affair&#x27;, for Greenhough had dined frequently with Decimus&#x27;s parents and Decimus&#x27;s brothers, including the physician Henry Burton. Greenough and Decimus finalized their designs during numerous meetings at the opera. 

Decimus&#x27;s design, when the villa had been completed, was described in &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; as, &#x27;One of the most elegant and successful adaptations of the Grecian style to purposes of modern domestic architecture to be found in this or any country&#x27;. Subsequently, Nash invited Burton to design Clarence Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park. Nash was appointed architectural &#x27;overseer&#x27; for Decimus&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park projects: Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Chester Terrace, Clarence Terrace, the villas along the Inner Circle, including The Holme and the London Colosseum according to Thomas Hornor&#x27;s specifications. However, to Nash&#x27;s great annoyance, Decimus disregarded the latter&#x27;s advice and developed the terraces according to his own style. As a result, Nash sought, unsuccessfully, to demolish and completely rebuild Chester Terrace. Decimus subsequently eclipsed his master and emerged as the dominant force in the design of Carlton House Terrace, where he exclusively designed No. 3 and No. 4. Decimus also designed some of the villas of the Inner Circle: his villa for the Marquess of Hertford has been described as, &#x27;decorated simplicity, such as the hand of taste, aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute&#x27;.

===Other influences===

Decimus was a polymath and a philomath and extremely erudite in both arts and sciences, as was demonstrated by the diversity of his library – a part of which was auctioned off by his nieces after his death. The sale catalogue listed 347 separate lots, some of which ran into many volumes, and demonstrated the diversity of his intellectual interests: it contained the complete Proceedings of the Camden Society, in 135 volumes; and transactions of many of the learned societies of which Burton was a member; and the complete &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; (70 vols.) of G. L. L. Buffon and Bernard Germain de Lacépède; and standard works on classical architecture, such as the five volumes of Colen Campbell, &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot; by John Woolfe and James Gandon, James Gibbs&#x27;s &quot;Book of Architecture&quot;, and William Kent&#x27;s &quot;The Designs of Inigo Jones&quot;; and numerous topographical views and surveys of cities and counties in the collection; and foreign-language texts, including volumes by Charles Percier and Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, and a complete set of Giovanni Battista Piranesi&#x27;s works, and several dictionaries. The absence of any &quot;Grand Tour&quot; early in Decimus&#x27;s career meant that his books and casts were the sources for his early designs, which are technically formal in style. However, he subsequently travelled extensively in Europe and North America. His first tours were of France and Spain, in 1826. He toured the Netherlands in 1846 and Germany in 1850. He toured Italy, including Venice. He toured Canada and the United States, after departing Liverpool for Halifax, Nova Scotia, with his cousin Thomas Chandler Haliburton, a Tory MP and author. Burton collected casts, which informed his work, over 200 of which he donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which displayed 18 of the same in its British Galleries. 

Although he was the leading exponent of Greek revival architecture, Burton was uniquely and significantly influenced by Ancient Roman architecture. It was in his Georgian neoclassical work that he attained the acme of his excellence. Dana Arnold (2002) described his Neoclassical work thus:

&quot;His use of the orders is always correct, but he showed a lack of pedantry in their application that sets him apart from some of his more doctrinaire contemporaries, such as Hamilton and Smirke. From Nash he had learned to combine the classical and the picturesque, and it is the picturesque that is predominant in much of his later work&quot;.

In his later career, Decimus designed buildings in the Gothic revival style, the &quot;old English&quot; style and in the &quot;cottage orné&quot; style. His Gothic revival designs are unoriginal as he had little sympathy for the style.

==Life==

Burton has been described, by architectural scholar Guy Williams, as &quot;rich, cool, well-dressed, apparently celibate, the designer and prime member of the Athenaeum, one of London&#x27;s grandest gentlemens&#x27; clubs&quot; where Burton &quot;mixed with many of the greatest in the land, meeting the most creative as well as those with enormous hereditary wealth&quot;. By 1826, the name of Decimus Burton &quot;was on the lips of everyone who cared at all about the arts and architecture&quot;: he was &quot;very well liked [and] his modesty, politeness, and upright bearing were endearing&quot; and &quot;his integrity and professional competence were worthy of the greatest respect&quot;. Burton was treated by the aristocracy &#x27;more as a friend than as a professional advisor&#x27; and his close friendships with, and patronage by, the aristocracy were undamaged by the vituperation of both his person and his neoclassical architecture by Augustus Pugin and his disciples. The &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; commended Burton&#x27;s &quot;extreme amiability of character&quot;.

The Burtons&#x27; social circle included Princess Victoria; the Duchess of Kent; William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire; John Wilson Croker; John Nash; Sir Humphry Davy; George Bellas Greenough; Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood; and their Canadian cousin, Thomas Chandler Haliburton. Decimus and his siblings, Jane, James (born 1786), Septimus, the solicitor, Octavia, and Jessy, would host Thomas on his visits to London.

Burton was &quot;on excellent terms&quot; with Princess Victoria, and with the Duchess of Kent. The Princess and the Duchess, with several courtiers, had laid the foundation stone of a Decimus Burton School in Tunbridge Wells, and, five weeks later, in autumn 1834, they had stayed, by Burton&#x27;s invitation, at James Burton&#x27;s private villa at St Leonards-on-Sea, until several weeks into 1835.

From 1818, Burton resided, with his father, at The Holme, Regent&#x27;s Park, which has been described as &quot;one of the most desirable private homes in London&quot;, which was designed as the Burton family mansion by Decimus, and built by James Burton&#x27;s own company. The Holme was the second villa to be built in Regent&#x27;s Park, and the first of those to be designed or constructed by the Burton family. The hallmark of the Burton design is the large semi-circular bay that divided the principal elevation, and which extended for two storeys. The original villa also had a conservatory of polygonal form, which used wrought iron glazing bars, then only recently patented, instead of the then customary wooden bars. The first villa to be constructed in the park was St John&#x27;s Lodge by John Raffield.

Burton bought from the Crown a plot at Spring Gardens, St. James&#x27;s Park, at the east end of The Mall, where he constructed, in the Georgian neoclassical townhouse style, No. 10, 12, and 14 Spring Gardens, as both his townhouse and his principal office. The buildings no longer exist, but elevations of them appear in the former LCC&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot; Vol. XX, and views of their interiors have been preserved in Hastings Museum and Art Gallery. At the end of 1834, Burton had two &quot;comfortable well-staffed homes&quot;, one in Spring Gardens and one at Tunbridge Wells, where he had another office at No. 10 Calverley Parade, where the Tunbridge Wells Town Hall now stands. Williams records that, for Burton, &quot;Money was rolling in. Income tax was of no concern. [Decimus] had a brother who could look after his business affairs and see to his investments&quot;.

Burton retired in 1869, and subsequently resided at his homes at Gloucester Gardens, Kensington, and St. Leonards Lodge, St. Leonards-on-Sea, which adjoined &#x27;The Uplands&#x27; and &#x27;The Lawn&#x27; developments which he had designed. He never married nor had issue. He died in December 1881, at 1 Gloucester Road, Kensington, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, alongside his brother Henry Burton, and his sister Jessy Burton. Decimus was the last of his siblings to die. Over his grave is a tapering sarcophagus of grey Cornish granite, on a stepped base, with a shallow pyramidal cover. His tomb was Grade II listed building in 2001. On his death, his property, including his extensive library and all of his architectural drafts and notes passed to surviving members of his family, mostly to his nephew Alfred Henry Burton (d.1917) or his two unmarried nieces, Helen and Emily Jane Wood, who subsequently sold their share, despite that he had left his library to the Royal Institute of British Architects, of which he had served as president. However, Burton donated 200 of his extensive collection of casts, which informed his work, to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which displayed 18 of the same in its British Galleries. Amongst Burton&#x27;s possession on his death were an oil painting of St. John, copied by Sir Joshua Reynolds from a work by Raphael; a model of the Temple on the Ilissus at Athens; a statuette of an Angel copied from an original by Thorvaldsen; framed drawings of &#x27;A Royal Palace&#x27; by Joseph Gandy ARA (b. 1771), who had been described as &#x27;an English Piranesi&#x27;; and a bronze lamp suspended from a snake&#x27;s mouth. An obituary notice said &quot;No architect was better known, and none was better respected, for he was amiable, considerable, and gentle to all&quot;.

==Career==
===Central London Parks===
During the second half of the 1820s, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the King resolved that Hyde Park, and the area around it, must be renovated to the extent of the splendor of rival European capital cities, and that the essence of the new arrangement would be a triumphal approach to Buckingham Palace, which had been recently completed. The committee of the project, led by the Prime Minister, Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, and advised by Charles Arbuthnot, President of the Board of Commissioners of Woods and Forests, selected Decimus Burton as the project&#x27;s architect: in 1828, when giving evidence to a Parliamentary select committee on the Government&#x27;s spending on public works, Arbuthnot explained that he had nominated Burton &#x27;having seen in the Regent&#x27;s Park, and elsewhere, works which pleased my eye, from their architectural beauty and correctness&#x27;. Burton intended to create an urban space dedicated to the celebration of the House of Hanover, national pride, and the nation&#x27;s heroes.

The renovation of Hyde Park, Green Park, and St James&#x27;s Park, began, in 1825, with the demarcation of new drives and pathways, subsequent to which Burton designed new lodges and gates, viz. Cumberland Gate, Stanhope Gate, Grosvenor Gate, the Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, and, later, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Gate, Knightsbridge, in the classical style. There were no authoritative precedents for such buildings, which required windows and chimney stacks, in the classical style, and, in the words of Guy Williams, &#x27;Burton&#x27;s reticent treatment of the supernumerary features&#x27; and of the cast iron gates and railings, was &#x27;greatly admired&#x27;.

At Hyde Park Corner, the King required that &quot;some great ceremonial outwork that would be worthy of the new palace that lay to its rear&quot;, and accepted Burton&#x27;s consequent proposal for a sequence comprising a gateway and a classical screen, and a triumphal arch, which would enable those approaching Buckingham Palace from the north to ride or drive first through the screen and then through the arch, before turning left to descend Constitution Hill and enter the forecourt of Buckingham Palace through Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch. The screen became the Roman revival Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, which delighted the King and his Committee, and which architectural historian Guy Williams describes as &#x27;one of the most pleasing architectural works that have survived from the neo-classical age&#x27;. The triumphal arch became the Wellington Arch at Constitution Hill into Green Park, London, which has been described as &#x27;one of London&#x27;s best loved landmarks&#x27;. Burton designed the arch&#x27;s iron gates, which were constructed by Bramah and Co. of Pimlico. Burton&#x27;s original design for the triumphal arch, which was modelled on the Arch of Titus at Rome, on which the central and side blocks of the Screen had been modelled, was more technically perfect, and coherent with the Screen, than that of the arch that was subsequently built: this original design, however, was rejected by the committee – who had envisaged a design based on the Arch of Constantine (on which Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch had been modelled) – because it was not sufficiently ostentatious. Burton created a new design, &quot;to pander to the majestic ego&quot;, which was much larger and modelled on a fragment found in the Ancient Roman forum, which was accepted on 14 January 1826, and subsequently built as the present Wellington Arch.

====Sculpture of the Triumphal Arch====
The arch at Constitution Hill was left devoid of decorative sculpture as a result of the moratorium in 1828 on public building work, and, instead, despite the absolute objection of Burton, was mounted with an ungainly equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, the son of the then recently deceased James Wyatt, who had been selected by statue&#x27;s commissioner, and one of its few subsequent advocates, Sir Frederick Trench. Matthew Cotes Wyatt was not competent: Guy Williams contends that he was &#x27;not noticeably talented&#x27;, and the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that &#x27;thanks to royal and other influential patronage, Wyatt enjoyed a reputation and practice to which his mediocre abilities hardly entitled him&#x27;. Trench, and his patrons the Duke and Duchess of Rutland, had told the public subscribers to the statue that the statue would be place on top of Burton&#x27;s triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner: Burton expressed his opposition to this proposal &#x27;as plainly and as vehemently as his nature allowed&#x27; consistently over successive years, because the ungainly statue would &#x27;disfigure&#x27; his arch, for which it was much too large, and the surrounding neighbourhood, because it would have to be placed, contrary to all classical precedent, across, instead of parallel with, the roadway under the arch. 

Burton had envisaged that his arch would be topped with only a small quadriga whose horses would have been parallel with the road under the arch. Burton&#x27;s objections were extensively endorsed by most of the aristocratic residents of London. A writer in &quot;The Builder&quot; asked Charles Canning, the First Commissioner for Woods and Forests, to ban the project: &quot;We have learnt, and can state positively, that Mr. Burton has the strongest objection possible against placing the group in question on the archway... and that he is taking no part whatever in the alteration proposed to be made in the upper part of the structure to prepare it to receive the pedestal... Mr. Burton, through the mildness which characterizes him, has not expressed this opinion so loudly and so publicly as he ought to have done... an opinion prevails very generally, that he is a party to the proceedings, and this has induced many to be silent who would otherwise have spoken...&quot;. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, contended that another site would be preferable, and proposed, on behalf of the Crown, to offer any other site, but the statue&#x27;s subscribers rejected all alternative proposals. Every single MP except Sir Frederick Trench wanted the statue to be placed elsewhere. 

Canning wrote that &#x27;the remonstrances which reach Her Majesty&#x27;s Government against the proposed appropriation of the arch are so many and so strong, the representations of its architect, Mr. Burton, in the same sense, are so earnest, and the opinion of every other eminent architect, artist, or other competent authority who has been consulted on the subject is so decided [against the placing of the Wellington statue on the arch]&quot;&quot;.

Decimus Burton himself wrote, &quot;The arch would, I consider, suffer greatly in importance if the colossal statue in question be placed there, because it would become a mere pedestal. The want of proportion in the proposed surmount, compared with the columns and other details of the architecture, would show that they had been designed by different hands, and without reference for each other. ...I have desired to witness the completion of this building, as originally designed by me, and as approved by the Lords of the Treasury, yet I would prefer that the building should remain for the present in its forlorn and bare state, rather than a colossal equestrian statue should be placed upon it... I fear that if this appropriation of the building should be decided upon, a proposition would soon be made for removing altogether the facades of columns, the slender proportions of which would appear so incongruous and out of proportion compared with the prodigious dimensions of the statue&quot;. 

Burton had realized that the disciples of Pugin and advocates of Pugin&#x27;s anti-classicism would remove all classical elements from his arch if permitted the opportunity to do so. The Government placed the Wellington statue on the arch in autumn 1846: Williams contends that the product was &#x27;ridiculous&#x27;. &quot;The Builder&quot; contended, &quot;down, unquestionably, it must come. As the network of timber is removed, spar by spar, from before it, so do the folly of the experiment, the absurdity of the conjunction, and the greatness of the sacrifice become apparent. Its effect is even worse than we anticipated – the destruction of the arch by the statue, and of the statue by its elevation on the arch, more complete. Every post brings us letters urging renewed efforts to remove the figure to another site&quot;. The contestation about the prospective removal of the statue became national. However, the Government failed to remove the statue, despite that they had professed, when it had been placed, that they would do so if it provoked the aversion which it had provoked. Foreign intellectuals who visited London identified the incongruous fusion of the statue and the arch as &quot;spectacular confirmation&quot; of the &quot;artistic ignorance of the English&quot;. Architectural historian Guy Williams writes that &quot;[the] arch at Hyde Park Corner is a visible reminder of one of the fiercest attacks that have ever been launched in the worlds of art and architecture. The face of London might have been very different now – freer, perhaps, of the &#x27;monstrous carbuncles&#x27; so disliked by the present Prince of Wales – if the attacked party [Decimus Burton] had been a little more pugnacious, and so better equipped to stand his ground&quot;.


In 1847 the problem of accommodating Queen Victoria&#x27;s expanding family was becoming acute. It was &quot;solved&quot; in two steps by Decimus Burton and W.A. Nesfield. With his eye for landscape, Burton had John Nash&#x27;s triumphal monument, originally intended as the entrance to the palace, relocated to the north eastern corner of Hyde Park. He consulted on filling in the Buckingham Palace forecourt, creating new interiors and the courtyard we know today. The Royal Family were able to move in to more spacious premises. Moving the arch, stone by stone, was left to the engineering skills of Thomas Cubitt and took four years. The siting at the Cumberland Gate entrance to the park was eventually completed in 1851.

During 1882, traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner motivated advocacy for Burton&#x27;s triumphal arch to be moved to the top of Constitution Hill to create space for traffic. In response to this advocacy, Burton&#x27;s great-nephew Francis Fearon compiled and published a pamphlet that advocated the removal of the Wellington statue from the arch in the event of the removal of the arch to another location: Fearon contended that the arch should be &#x27;relieved once and for all of its unsightly load&#x27;. The campaign led by Fearon was successful: Wyatt&#x27;s incongruous statue was removed to Aldershot, and its place on Burton&#x27;s arch, which was moved to Constitution Hill in 1883, was occupied by a Quadriga by Captain Adrian Jones. Jones&#x27; statue is not nearly as elegant as Burton&#x27;s designed statue intended for the arch, but it is more coherent with the arch than Wyatt&#x27;s statue, and its figures, unlike those of Wyatt&#x27;s statue, are aligned with the roadway under the arch.

====London Zoo====
By the end of 1829, Burton had completed London Zoo, which had opened in April 1828, to fervent commendation. Guy Williams records, &quot;From all sides, Decimus Burton&#x27;s Zoo buildings received the highest praise. They were playful - witty, even - while being architecturally beyond reproach. They made a visit to the Zoo an aesthetic, as well as an educational, pleasure. They brought a suggestion of foreign lands to the flattish expanses at the foot of Primrose Hill&quot;. Burton laid out the Zoo in the picturesque style, and designed the early animal houses in the cottage orné style. As a consequence of the success of his London Zoo designs, Burton received more commissions than he were able to complete himself, and, consequently, employed assistants, began to train pupils, and bought a plot at Spring Gardens, St. James&#x27;s Park, at the east end of The Mall, where he constructed Nos. 10, and 11, and 12 Spring Gardens as both his townhouse and his office.

====Architecture as environment====
Burton was one of the first architects to consider the implications of architecture on the creation of distinct urban environments. The evidence given by Burton to two Parliamentary select committees demonstrates the breadth of his knowledge, and the esteem in which his opinion was held by his contemporaries. Burton&#x27;s evidence to the 1840 Select Committee, which discussed plans to develop Trafalgar Square, popularised his views on urban development. This is one of the first examples of public discourse about an urban space that acknowledged the potential for its national and political significance.

===Athenaeum Club===
The Athenaeum was founded in 1824 at the instigation of John Wilson Croker, then Secretary to the Admiralty, who was primarily responsible for the organisation and early development of the club. In 1823, Croker wrote to Sir Humphry Davy, &quot;I will take the opportunity of repeating the proposition I have made to you about a Club for Literary and Scientific men and followers of the Fine Arts. The fashionable and Military Clubs... have spoiled all the Coffee Houses and Taverns so that the artist, or mere literary man... are in a much worse position&quot;. 

Croker suggested 30 names for the club&#x27;s organizing Committee, including the Earl of Aberdeen, the Earl of Ashburnham, Earl Spencer, Lord Palmerston, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Francis Chantrey, and Robert Smirke the Younger: all of those invited, except Richard Payne Knight, accepted. The first meeting of the Athenaeum, with 14 men present, was held at the rooms of the Royal Society on 16 February 1824, where a committee was formed that resolved: first, that temporary premises would be rented at 12 Waterloo Place, which had been constructed by the company of Club member James Burton, the pre-eminent London property developer; and, second, that Decimus Burton, then 24 years old, would be commissioned to design a permanent clubhouse. The Trustees of the Club who employed Burton were the Earl of Aberdeen, former Prime Minister and President of the Society of Antiquaries of London; Sir Thomas Lawrence, President of the Royal Academy; and Sir Humphry Davy, President of the Royal Society. Decimus continued to work for the club until 1864, and designed Croker&#x27;s villa at Stokes Bay, near Gosport, in around 1840. Burton&#x27;s Athenaeum clubhouse is in the Neoclassical style, with both Ancient Greek, Ancient Roman, and Renaissance Italian elements: it has a Doric portico with paired columns, and has been described by architectural scholar Guy Williams as &#x27;a building of remarkable grace and astonishing novelty&#x27; with a central staircase that is &#x27;distinctly Egyptian in flavour&#x27;. The Corinthian-columns of the entrance hall, informed by those of the Athenian Tower of the Winds, are Greek: the barrel-vaulted ceiling Roman. John Summerson contends design were informed by that of Baldassare Peruzzi&#x27;s 17th century Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome. 

Burton made himself responsible for the design of as many of the decorative features of the club as possible, including the clock-cases and the pendant light-fittings. When the Clubhouse was completed in April 1830, the members of the Club Committee stated, &quot;[They] are bound to express their entire satisfaction at the manner in which the work has been carried out by Mr. Burton. They can testify, and indeed the foregoing Accounts evince, the general accuracy of his estimates and they trust that the Club at large, as well as the public, must be satisfied of his professional skill, and the beauty of his architectural designs&quot;. Decimus Burton subsequently became the &quot;prime member of the Athenaeum, one of London&#x27;s grandest gentlemen&#x27;s clubs&quot;, of which his father James was also a member. The cast of the Apollo Belvedere positioned in the recess at the top of the principal staircase at the Athenaeum was a gift to the club from Decimus. There is a photographic portrait of Decimus, taken in 1873, preserved at the club, and the Club retains some furniture designed by Decimus. Another early member was Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, a close friend of the Burtons.

===Calverley Estate===
Burton was commissioned to develop the Calverley Estate by John Ward, an MP for whom he had designed his first neoclassical country residence. Great Mount Pleasant, a mansion owned by the Duke of Leeds, had been used by the Princess Victoria and the Duchess of Kent. The villas constructed by Burton on the Calverley Estate were intended for the gentry, and each would be able to accommodate several servants. Burton&#x27;s design is predominantly Georgian neoclassical in style, but includes elements of the Italianate-, Old English or Tudor-, neogothic-, and cottage orne styles. Burton designed 24 villas, the first of which was completed in autumn 1828: nearly twenty years would pass until the last villa of the series were complete. Burton also constructed a series of Tudor-style servants&#x27; cottages, and three grand entrances to the estate: the Victoria Gate, and the less ornate Keston Lodge and Farnborough Lodge.

In 1832, Calverley Park Crescent, designed by Burton, modelled partially on those at Bath and Buxton, was constructed at Calverley. The Crescent contained 17 shops, and covered areas for spectators. Burton&#x27;s development of the Calverley Estate contained elements of the neoclassical-, the Old English-, and the neogothic styles, and was highly commended: it has been described as &quot;a landmark in English domestic architecture&quot; and the &quot;prototype garden suburb&quot;. 

M. Wilson contends that &#x27;Decimus Burton&#x27;s laying out of the Calverley Estate is the best surviving embodiment of Early Victorian seriousness and refinement&#x27;. Christopher Hussey, of &quot;Country Life&quot;, commended Burton&#x27;s &#x27;restrained eclectism&#x27; in the Calverley developments. Williams contends that the Calverley Estate be &#x27;one of the great architectural successes of the nineteenth century&#x27; and that &#x27;Decimus Burton&#x27;s reputation could be assured by his work here alone&#x27;, and describes Burton&#x27;s villas at the estate as &#x27;domestic masterpiece[s]&#x27;. Henry Russell Hitchcock described Burton&#x27;s Calverley Estate as &#x27;the finest extant example&#x27; of its kind. Sir John Soane&#x27;s friend John Britton described Burton&#x27;s Calverley as a &#x27;beautiful pleasure garden&#x27;. 

Philip Whitbourn contends that Burton has been inaccurately &#x27;sometimes stereotyped as [one] feeling no enthusiasm for the Gothic Revival&#x27; and that &#x27;it is as a master not only of the neoclassical but also of the picturesque that Decimus Burton should be remembered&#x27;. William Willicombe&#x27;s subsequent designs on the Calverley Estate, including Lansdowne Road and Calverley Park Gardens, were informed by Burton, with whom he had worked on Burton&#x27;s earlier parts of the town.

===Constructions in the neo-gothic style===
Burton was commissioned to design Holy Trinity Church at Tunbridge Wells in the neo-gothic style: he unwisely accepted the commission despite that he was &#x27;neither by temperament nor training&#x27; qualified to design a work in this style, of which he knew little, and his design was censured, in addition to commended as a &#x27;beautiful structure&#x27; and a &#x27;handsome structure&#x27; which &#x27;reflects great credit on the architect&#x27;. A more unanimously successful attempt to design in the neogothic style was St Mary&#x27;s Church, Goring-by-Sea, which he redesigned, for the Tory MP David Lyon, between 1836 and 1838.

===Neoclassical Houses of Parliament and vituperation by Augustus W. N. Pugin===
Burton created a design for a new neoclassical Houses of Parliament. Decimus Burton and his pupils commended the purchase of the Elgin Marbles for the nation, and the erection of a neoclassical gallery in which they could be displayed to the same, and subsequently contended that the Burning of Parliament in the fire of 1834 were an opportunity for the creation of a splendid neoclassical replacement of the Houses of Parliament, in which the Elgin Marbles could be displayed: they expressed their aversion that the new seat of the British Empire would &quot;be doomed to crouch and wither in the , vaultings, tracery, pointed roof, and flying buttresses of a Gothic building…&quot;: a building of a style that they contended to be improper ‘to the prevailing sentiment of an age so enlightened’. In contradistinction to the neo-gothic style, they commended those who had ‘built St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, to the satisfaction of an applauding posterity, in the more beautiful and universal style of Roman architecture’. 

However, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, wanted, now that he were premier, to disassociate himself from the controversial John Wilson Croker, who was a founding member of the Athenaeum, close associate of the Burtons, an advocate of neoclassicism, and repudiator of the neo-gothic style: consequently, Peel appointed a committee chaired by Edward Cust, a detestor of the style of Nash and William Wilkins, which resolved that the new Houses of Parliament would have to be in either the ‘gothic’ or the ‘Elizabethan’ style. 

Augustus Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, James Gillespie-Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Roman Catholicism, as a consequence of which any design submitted in his own name would certainly have been automatically rejected; the design he submitted for improvements to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1843 were rejected for this reason. The design for Parliament that Pugin submitted through Barry won the competition. Subsequent to the announcement of the design ascribed to Barry, William Richard Hamilton, who had been secretary to Lord Elgin during the acquisition and transportation of the Elgin Marbles, published a pamphlet in which he censured the fact that ‘gothic barbarism’ had been preferred to the masterful designs of Ancient Greece and Rome: but the judgement was not altered, and was ratified by the Commons and the Lords. The commissioners subsequently appointed Pugin to assist in the construction of the interior of the new Palace, to the design of which Pugin himself had been the foremost determiner. The first stone of the new Pugin-Barry design was laid on 27 April 1840.

====Vituperation of Burton by Pugin====
During the competition for the design of the new Houses of Parliament, Burton, &quot;the land&#x27;s leading classicist&quot;, was vituperated with continuous invective, which Guy Williams has described as an &quot;anti-Burton campaign&quot;, by the foremost advocate of the neo-gothic style, Augustus Pugin, who was made enviously reproachful that Burton &quot;had done much more that Pugin&#x27;s father (Augustus Charles Pugin) to alter the appearance of London&quot;. Pugin attempted to popularize advocacy of the neo-gothic, and repudiation of the neoclassical, by composing and illustrating books that contended the supremacy of the former and the degeneracy of the latter, which were published from 1835. 

In 1845, Pugin, in his &quot;Contrasts: or a Parallel Between the Noble Edifices of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries and Similar Buildings of the Present Day&quot;, which the author had to publish himself as a consequence of the extent of the defamation of society architects therein, satirized John Nash as &quot;Mr Wash, Plasterer, who jobs out Day Work on Moderate Terms&quot;, and Burton as &quot;Talent of No Consequence, Premium Required&quot;, and included satirical sketches of Nash&#x27;s Buckingham Palace and Burton&#x27;s Wellington Arch. Consequently, the amount of commissions received by Burton declined, although he retained a close friendship with the aristocrats amongst his patrons, who continued to commission him. Burton completed a new portico, hall, and staircase for William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s Devonshire House; additions to 10 Belgrave Square for the second Earl of Burlington; the enlargement of Grimston Park, Yorkshire, for John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden and the Russian Princess Bagration; additions to Syon House for Lord Prudhoe; and a new town, Fleetwood, in Lancashire, for Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood.

===Glasshouses===
Decimus was primarily responsible for the &#x27;Great Stove&#x27; [conservatory] at Chatsworth House for the 6th Duke of Devonshire, for which Joseph Paxton has been erroneously attributed primary responsibility and credit. Architectural historian Guy Williams is unequivocal: Decimus Burton was &quot;[the] designer of the Great Stove at Chatsworth&quot;. Burton, who was advisor to the Royal Botanic Society, also designed the &#x27;Winter Garden&#x27; glasshouse of the Royal Botanic Society in Regent&#x27;s Park, and the Palm House, originally named &#x27;the Stove&#x27;, and Temperate House at Kew Gardens. The constructed Palm House is the consequence of the collaboration of Burton and Richard Turner: &#x27;Decimus Burton contributed his considerable flair for creating refined and elegant structures and Richard Turner a singular talent for metal fabrication&#x27;. Burton&#x27;s Palm House has been described as &quot;one of the boldest pieces of 19th century functionalism in existence - much bolder indeed, and hence aesthetically much more satisfying than Crystal Palace ever was&quot;. 

Philip Whitbourn contends that Burton&#x27;s Palm House &#x27;could have a just claim as the world&#x27;s most important surviving Victorian glass and iron structure&#x27;. Joseph Paxton&#x27;s Crystal Palace was derived almost entirely from the glasshouse work of Decimus Burton and Richard Turner. Subsequent to his retirement there, Decimus designed and constructed several buildings at St Leonards-on-Sea. Burton&#x27;s Temperate House at Kew, which is double the size of his Palm House and the world&#x27;s largest surviving Victorian glass structure, was only completed after his death, in 1898, and has become one of his most popularly acclaimed works: Williams writes of the Temperate House, &quot;It makes one wonder how much the appearance of London might not have been improved if Augustus W. N. Pugin had never started his anti-Burton campaign&quot;. Burton&#x27;s other works at Kew include the Museum No.1, the Campanile, and the Main Entrance Gates to Kew Green. Burton&#x27;s Glasshouses at Kew constituted the UK&#x27;s case for Kew to be made an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002.

===Further studies and elections===
From 1830 to 1834, Burton studied at Clifford&#x27;s Inn. The architectural historian, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, believes that Decimus was the designer of the Gatehouse and the Inn buildings.

In 1832 Decimus Burton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts; a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London; a founding Fellow, and later vice-president, of the Royal Institute of British Architects; and was architect to the Royal Botanic Society from 1840. An 1828 testimonial for his election to Fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries described him as &#x27;Architect and Gentleman, well versed in the History and Antiquaries of this Kingdom&#x27;: he was elected FSA on 8 January 1829, during the tenure of W. R. Hamilton, Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, as vice-president.

===Protégés===
Burton trained his nephew, Henry Marley Burton (1821–1880) the son of his eldest brother, William Ford Burton. Henry Marley Burton succeeded to Decimus&#x27;s architectural practice subsequent to Decimus&#x27;s retirement. In 1866, Henry Marley was commissioned by John George Dodson, 1st Baron Monk Bretton to design a mansion at Coneyborough. Decimus had previously designed Bineham in Chailey for Dodson&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Blencowe. Burton also taught the architects Henry Currey, George Mair, John Crake, Arthur William Hakewill, and E.J. May, who was his last pupil.

===Legacy===
Despite the fact that he had left his library to the Royal Institute of British Architects, of which he had served as president, most of it was deposited instead with his two unmarried nieces, Helen and Emily Jane Wood, who subsequently sold it, and the remainder was distributed among other family members. As a consequence, according to Dana Arnold, there is a gross imbalance between the ‘scale and significance’ of Decimus Burton&#x27;s work and the amount of documentary evidence about it that has come into the public domain. Given the fragmentary nature of written sources concerning his work, he has tended to be relegated, quite undeservedly, &#x27;to the margins of architectural histories’. However, Burton&#x27;s works in London, especially those around Hyde Park, Green Park, Regent&#x27;s Park, remains a lasting and resplendent memorial. His reputation has increased since the commencement of the 20th century, during which a &quot;Burtons&#x27; St Leonards Society&quot; has been founded in St Leonards-on-Sea to &#x27;encourage the preservation of the work of James and Decimus Burton and to prevent development unsympathetic to its character&#x27;, which has successfully thwarted several attempts to create new developments that would have violated the beauty of the Burtons&#x27; project.

The recently completed restoration (2018) of the Temperate House at London&#x27;s Kew Gardens has prompted a re-evaluation of Burton&#x27;s horticultural designs. Douglas Murphy contends that Burton&#x27;s use of &quot;Iron and glass, through shedding ornament and aiming for efficient performance over capricious pomp, was retroactively understood as the historic forerunner of Modernism, meaning that what had been thought of as mere engineering was allowed to enter the pantheon of true architecture. Burton&#x27;s name was now fortunately attached to some of the most significant works of that type&quot;.

Burton&#x27;s legacy on either side of the Irish Sea endures. In April 2017 the Hearsum Collection, in collaboration with The Royal Parks and Ireland&#x27;s Office of Public Works, mounted an exhibition at Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park entitled &quot;Parks, Our Shared Heritage: The Phoenix Park, Dublin &amp; The Royal Parks, London&quot;, demonstrating the historical links between Richmond Park (and other Royal Parks in London) and Phoenix Park. This exhibition was also displayed at the Mall Galleries in London in July and August 2017.
==List of architectural projects==
The projects are listed by county in alphabetical order. The list is based on the work of , and on the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for &quot;Burton, Decimus (1800–1881)&quot;, by Dana Arnold. Any other sources are specified individually.

===Buckinghamshire===
* Stockgrove House, Buckinghamshire/Bedfordshire border (1831) demolished circa 1928

===East Sussex===
* Oaklands Park, Sedlescombe Sedlescombe (1830)
* Adelaide Crescent, Hove, Brighton, (1831 – 1834, for Sir Isaac Goldsmith). The style that Burton used here was the progenitor of that which Osbert Lancaster subsequently termed &#x27;Kensington Italianate&#x27;. (Only numbers 1–10 were built in Burton&#x27;s style: the remainder were completed from 1850 to a much grander design)
* Wick Hall, Hove (1840; demolished 1936)

====St Leonards-on-Sea====
In 1828 Burton&#x27;s father, James, bought an estate in East Sussex, on which he built the new town of St Leonard&#x27;s-on-Sea, as a pleasure resort for the gentry. Decimus designed the majority of the buildings.
===Central London===
* The Holme, Inner Circle, Regent&#x27;s Park (1818). From 1818, Burton resided, with his father, at The Holme, Regent&#x27;s Park, which has been described as &#x27;one of the most desirable private homes in London&#x27;, which was designed as the Burton family mansion by Decimus, and built by James Burton&#x27;s own company. The Holme was the second villa to be built in Regent&#x27;s Park, and the first of those to be designed or constructed by the Burton family. The hallmark of the Burton design is the large semi-circular bay that divided the principal elevation, and which extended for two storeys. The original villa also had a conservatory of polygonal form, which used wrought iron glazing bars, then only recently patented, instead of the then customary wooden bars.
* Clarence Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park (1823)
* The original Winfield House (1825) for Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford, which became known as &#x27;St. Dunstan&#x27;s Villa&#x27;. Burton&#x27;s creation was described as, &#x27;decorated simplicity, such as the hand of taste, aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute&#x27;. Burton&#x27;s creation was subsequently reconstructed as a building with a modern exterior. In 1819, Burton had also designed for the same commissioner a South Villa, the designs of which were exhibited at Royal Academy in 1822 and in 1825, the manuscript drawings of which are now in the Library of the Architectural Association, London.
* Cornwall Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London (1821)
* Chester Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park

* Beulah Spa, Upper Norwood, London SE (1831). Burton landscaped the grounds and designed the buildings for the entrepreneur, John Davidson Smith. It became a popular society venue attracting large crowds to its &quot;fêtes&quot;. Burton&#x27;s buildings were in a &quot; rustic&quot; style, with the ticket office in the form of a thatched cottage. The Spa closed in 1856 soon after the opening of the nearby Crystal Palace. Burton also drew up designs for a grand crescent of terraced houses on hill above the spa, which was, however, never built.
* Holwood House, Keston (1823–1826) This has been described as &#x27;splendidly Grecian... the best thing of its kind in Kent&#x27;.

===Lancashire===
Burton&#x27;s work with his father on the East Sussex town of St Leonards-on-Sea, between 1827 and 1837, had so impressed their friend, and fellow Atheneaum Club member, Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood that he commissioned Burton to design and lay out his new port and seaside resort of Fleetwood.

<text>STS-41-G (formerly STS-17) was the 13th flight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and the sixth flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. &quot;Challenger&quot; launched on October 5, 1984, and conducted the second shuttle landing at Kennedy Space Center on October 13, 1984. It was the first shuttle mission to carry a crew of seven, including the first crew with two women (Sally K. Ride and Kathryn D. Sullivan), the first American Extravehicular activity (EVA) involving a woman (Sullivan), the first Australian-born person to journey into space as well as the first astronaut with a beard (Paul D. Scully-Power) and the first Canadian astronaut (Marc Garneau).

STS-41-G was the third shuttle mission to carry an IMAX camera on board to document the flight. Launch and in-orbit footage from the mission (including Sullivan and Leestma&#x27;s EVA) appeared in the 1985 IMAX movie &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;.

== Mission summary ==


On October 5, 1984, &quot;Challenger&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center at 7:03:00 a.m. EDT, marking the start of the STS-41-G mission. On board were seven crew members – the largest flight crew ever to fly on a single spacecraft at that time. They included commander Robert L. Crippen, making his fourth Shuttle flight and second in six months (Crippen became the first American astronaut to complete two space missions in the same calendar year); pilot Jon A. McBride; three mission specialists – David C. Leestma, Sally K. Ride and Kathryn D. Sullivan – and two payload specialists, Paul D. Scully-Power and Marc Garneau, the first Canadian citizen to serve as a Shuttle crew member, as well as the first Canadian in space. The mission also marked the first time two female astronauts had flown together.

Sullivan became the first American woman to walk in space when she and Leestma performed a 3-hour Extravehicular activity (EVA) on October 11, 1984, demonstrating the Orbital Refueling System (ORS) and proving the feasibility of refueling satellites in orbit.

Nine hours after liftoff, the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) was deployed from the payload bay by the Canadarm robot arm, and its on-board thrusters boosted it into orbit above the Earth. ERBS was the first of three planned satellites designed to measure the amount of energy received from the Sun and reradiated into space. It also studied the seasonal movement of energy from the tropics to the polar regions.

Another major mission activity was the operation of the Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B). The SIR-B was part of the OSTA-3 experiment package in the payload bay, which also included the Large Format Camera (LFC) to photograph the Earth, another camera called MAPS which measured air pollution, and a feature identification and location experiment called FILE, which consisted of two TV cameras and two still cameras.

The SIR-B was an improved version of a similar device flown on the OSTA-1 package during STS-2. It had an eight-panel antenna array measuring . It operated throughout the flight, but problems were encountered with &quot;Challenger&quot;″s Ku-band antenna, and therefore much of the data had to be recorded on board the orbiter rather than transmitted to Earth in real-time as was originally planned.

Payload Specialist Scully-Power, an employee of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), performed a series of oceanography observations during the mission. Garneau conducted a series of experiments sponsored by the Canadian government, called CANEX, which were related to medical, atmospheric, climatic, materials and robotic science. A number of Getaway Special (GAS) canisters, covering a wide variety of materials testing and physics experiments, were also flown.

A claim was later made that the Soviet Terra-3 laser testing center was used to track Challenger with a low-power laser on October 10, 1984. This supposedly caused the malfunction of on-board equipment and the temporary blinding of the crew, leading to a U.S. diplomatic protest. However, this story has been comprehensively denied by the crew members. In 2022, former Soviet Minister of Industry informed the Russian press that the Soviets had used a laser locator to lock onto the shuttle and hold the lock until it was 800 km from the test site.

During the 8 days, 5 hours, 23 minutes, and 33 seconds mission, &quot;Challenger&quot; traveled and completed 133 orbits. It landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at Kennedy Space Center – becoming the second shuttle mission to land there – on October 13, 1984, at 12:26 p.m. EDT.

The STS-41-G mission was later described in detail in the book &quot;Oceans to Orbit: The Story of Australia&#x27;s First Man in Space, Paul Scully-Power&quot; by space historian Colin Burgess.

Almost forty years after the flight, one of the OMS engines installed on &quot;Challenger&quot; for STS-41-G was reused and repurposed as the main engine for the Orion capsule on the Artemis I test flight around the Moon. The engine fired multiple times to adjust altitude and velocity, including bringing the capsule into and out of a Distant Retrograde Orbit around the Moon.

== Mission insignia ==
The thirteen complete stars in the blue field of the U.S. flag of the mission insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence and being essentially the 13th undertaken flight, by &#x27;obscuring&#x27; the remaining stars. (The 17 stars in the black field were indicative of the flight&#x27;s original designation as STS-17.) Central, as if it is launching, is an astronaut insignia in gold, which was presented to each astronaut since Project Mercury, after completing their first spaceflight, as a reference to the mostly rookie crew. Gender symbols are placed next to each astronaut&#x27;s name (the male symbol was &#x27;buffed up&#x27; as to make it feasible to visualize on the patch), and a Canadian flag icon is placed next to Garneau&#x27;s name.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>Buile Shuibhne or Buile Suibne (, The Madness of Suibhne or Suibhne&#x27;s Frenzy) is a medieval Irish tale about Suibhne mac Colmáin, king of the Dál nAraidi, who was driven insane by the curse of Saint Rónán Finn. The insanity makes Suibhne leave the Battle of Mag Rath and begin a life of wandering (which earns him the nickname Suibne Geilt or &quot;Suibhne the Madman&quot;). He dies under the refuge of St. Moling.

The tale is sometimes seen as an installment within a three-text cycle, continuing on from &quot;Fled Dúin na nGéd&quot; (&quot;The Feast of Dún na nGéd&quot;) and &quot;Cath Maige Rátha&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Mag Rath&quot;).

Suibhne&#x27;s name appears as early as the ninth century in a law tract (&quot;Book of Aicill&quot;), but &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot; did not take its current form until the twelfth century. includes a detailed analysis of the language and date of the text. He contends that the text in its final form is not as old as generally presumed but should be dated to the early thirteenth century.

==Suibhne&#x27;s identity==
The identity of Suibhne is a very convoluted matter as several texts mention different Suibhnes in regards with the Battle of Mag Rath. Buile Shuibhne specifies Suibhne as the son of Colman Cuar and as the king of Dál nAraidi in Ulster in Ireland (in particular in the areas of present-day county Down and county Antrim). This particular Suibhne son of Colman&#x27;s name can also be found in the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; and the Book of Lismore. The &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; state Suibhne, son of Colmán, died in the Battle of Mag Rath, making Buile seem a fanciful imagining of a dead warrior. Historical records of Dál nAraidi do exist. It was a historical kingdom inhabited by the Cruthin. However the king lists of Dál nAraidi in the Book of Leinster fail to mention any Suibhne son of Colmán Cuar as king, and identifies Congal Claen as king of Dál nAraidi during this time. James G. O’Keeffe has hypothesized a possible scenario where Suibhne might have been elected by the Cruithin to act as regent in the midst of King Congal&#x27;s exile.

==Text==
There are three manuscripts, B (Royal Irish Academy, B iv i), 1671–4; K (Royal Irish Academy, 23 K 44), 1721–2; and L (Brussels, 3410), 1629, a condensed version in the hand of Mícheál Ó Cléirigh. The text can be dated to broadly from 1200 to 1500 on linguistic grounds, but John O&#x27;Donovan asserted the writer must have lived before 1197 when the last chieftain of Tir Connail died who was descended from Domnall mac Áedo, since the work is intended to flatter this monarchic dynasty.

== Plot ==
===The saint&#x27;s curse===
In the legend, while Saint Rónán Finn was marking boundaries for a new church, the sound of his bell reached Suibhne&#x27;s ear. Suibhne, upon learning that this was church-making activity on his grounds, rushed out to expel St. Ronan from his territory. His wife Eorann tried to detain him by grabbing his cloak, which unraveled, leaving Suibhne to exit the house stark naked. Suibhne grabbed Ronan&#x27;s Psalter and threw it into the lake, and seized the Saint by the hand and started to drag him away. But Suibhne was interrupted by a messenger from Congal Claen requesting aid in the Battle of Mag Rath (near modern Moira, 637 A.D.).

The next day, the Psalter was returned unharmed by an otter that fetched it from the lake. The saint laid a curse upon Suibhne, condemning him to wander and fly around the world naked, and to meet his death by spear-point. In the ongoing war, St. Ronan had mediated a truce to last from each evening until morning, but Suibhne habitually broke this by killing during the hours when combat was not permitted.

One day, Bishop Ronan and his psalmists were on their round blessing the troops. Suibhne too received the sprinkling of holy water, but taking this as a taunt, he killed one of the bishop&#x27;s psalmists with a spear, and cast another at Ronan himself. The weapon pierced a hole in Ronan&#x27;s bell (hanging on his breast), and the broken-off shaft hurled in the air. At this, Ronan repeated the same curse: that Suibhne will wander like a bird, much as the spear-shaft, perch on tree branches at the sound of the bell, and die by the spear just as he had killed the monk. When battle resumed, the tremendous noise of the armies clashing drove Suibhne insane. His hands were numbed, his weapons fell, and he began to tread ever so lightly as a bird levitating in the air. (It is revealed much later on that like a bird, feathers had grown on him.)

===The madness and wandering===
The deranged Suibhne then left the battlefield, reaching a forest called Ros Bearaigh, in Glenn Earcain and perched on a yew tree. He was discovered by his kinsman Aongus the Fat, who was making his retreat from battle. Suibhne fled to Cell Riagain in Tir Conaill, alighting on another tree. There he was surrounded by the forces of Domnall mac Áedo, which was the side Suibhne and his Dál nAraidi kinsmen were warring against. The victorious Domnall nevertheless praised and pitied Suibhne and offered him gifts, but the madman would not comply.

Suibhne went to his home territory of Glenn Bolcáin, wandered seven years throughout Ireland, and returned to Glenn Bolcain, which was where his fortress and dwelling stood, and a celebrated valley of madmen. Suibhne&#x27;s movement was now being tracked by his kinsman Loingsechan, who had successfully taken the madman into custody three times before. Loingsechan in his millhouse had the opportunity to capture Suibhne, but the attempt failed, and he had to await another chance. Suibhne then paid a visit to his wife, who was living with another man, a contender for Suibhne&#x27;s kingship. Eorann maintained she would rather be with Suibhne, but he told her to remain with her new husband. An army stormed in, but Suibhne eluded capture.

Suibhne then returned to the yew tree at Ros Bearaigh, the same tree he went to when he first developed his madness, but when Eorann came to deceive and capture him, he moved away to another tree in Ros Ercain. However, his whereabouts were discovered, and Loingsechan coaxed him out of the tree, tricking him with the false news that his entire family had perished. Loingsechan brought Suibhne back to normal life and restored his sanity, but, while he was recuperating, the mill hag taunted him into a leaping contest. As they leapt, the noise of a hunting party returned Suibhne to madness. The mill hag eventually fell from her leap and was dashed to pieces. Since she was Loingsechan&#x27;s mother-in-law, this meant that Suibhne could not return to Dál nAraidi without facing vengeance.

Suibhne subsequently wandered various parts of Ireland, into Scotland and western England. He went from Roscommon to Slieve Aughty, Slieve Mis, Slieve Bloom mountain ranges; Inismurray island; the Cave of St. Donnan of Eigg, an island in the Scottish Inner Hebrides; then tarried for a month and a half in &quot;Carrick Alastair&quot; (Ailsa Craig off Scotland). He reached Britain and befriended a Fer Caille (Man of the Wood), who was another madman, and they spent an entire year together. The giant Briton met his predestined death by drowning in a waterfall.

===Death according to prophecy===
&quot;Fly through the air like the shaft of his spear and that he might die of a spear cast like the cleric whom he had slain.&quot;

Suibhne then returned to Ireland, to his home dominion of Glen Bocain. He visited his wife Eorann again but refused to go in the house for fear of confinement. Eorann then told him to leave, never to return, because the sight of him was an embarrassment to all. But after a while, Suibhne regained his lucidity and made his resolve to go back to Dál nAraidi, whatever judgment might befall him. St. Ronan learned of this and prayed to God to hinder Suibhne. Suibhne was haunted by headless cadavers and detached heads at Sliabh Fuaid.

Eventually, Suibhne arrived at &quot;The House of St. Moling&quot;, i.e. Teach Moling (St Mullin&#x27;s in County Carlow), and Moling harbored him after hearing the madman&#x27;s story. It might be noted that earlier, Suibhne had sung a stave predicting this place to be the place where he would meet his demise, and likewise, the Saint also knew this to be the madman&#x27;s resting place. As Suibhne attended Moling&#x27;s vespers, the priest instructed a parish woman employed as his cook to provide the madman with a meal (collation), in the form of daily milk. She did so by emptying milk into a hole she made with her foot in the cow dung. However, her husband (Moling&#x27;s herder) believed malicious hearsay about the two having a tryst, and in a fit of jealousy, thrust a spear into Suibhne while he was drinking from the hole. Thus Suibhne died in the manner prescribed by Ronan, but received his sacrament from Moling, &quot;as eric&quot;.

==Literary style==
The poetry in the story of Suibhne is rich and accomplished, and the story itself of the mad and exiled king who composes verse as he travels has held the imagination of poets since then. At every stop in his flight, Suibhne pauses to give a poem on the location and his plight, and his descriptions of the countryside and nature, as well as his pathos, are central to the development of the text. includes a detailed analysis of some of the poetry.

==Translations and adaptations==
Many poets have invoked Suibhne (most often under the English version of his name, Sweeney) – most notably in Seamus Heaney&#x27;s translation of the work into English, which he entitled &quot;Sweeney Astray&quot;. The author Flann O&#x27;Brien incorporated much of the story of &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot; into his comic novel &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, whose title is the English translation of the place name &#x27;Snámh dá én&#x27; in the tale. Another version from the Irish text, titled &quot;The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine&quot;, was published by the Irish poet Trevor Joyce.

A modern Irish version of Buile Shuibhne was published in 2010 by Seán Ó Sé. This was the first time that the full original text was made available in modern Irish.

Sweeney also appears as a character in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot; and is portrayed by Pablo Schreiber in its TV adaptation. In the TV adaptation, Ibis, saying that &quot;stories are truer than the truth,&quot; suggests that Sweeney is also Lugh, the Irish multi-skilled god of lightning, crafts and culture. However, Sweeney remembers his past as Buile Shuibhne, and denies that he is Lugh. Although, he begrudgingly remembers episodes of Lugh&#x27;s life such as the slaying of One-Eyed Balor of the Fomorians

A contemporary version of the legend by poet Patricia Monaghan explores Sweeney as an archetype of the warrior suffering from &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Heart&quot;.

W. D. Snodgrass introduces his poem &quot;Heart&#x27;s Needle&quot; with a reference to &quot;The Madness of Suibhne&quot;.

Irish poet and playwright Paula Meehan loosely based her 1997 drama &quot;Mrs. Sweeney&quot; on the Sweeney legend. Set in an inner-city Dublin flat complex called The Maria Goretti Mansions (recalling the factual Fatima Mansions), the play examines what life must have been like for Sweeney&#x27;s wife; as Meehan states, &quot;I wondered what it must have been like to be his woman.&quot; The play charts the trials and tribulations of Lil Sweeney&#x27;s life in the Maria Goretti flats as she deals with crime, poverty, unemployment, drug abuse, and tries to come to terms with the premature death of her daughter Chrisse, a heroin addict who died a year before the action starts from an AIDS related illness. Lil&#x27;s husband, Sweeney, is a pigeon fancier who, upon discovering that all his pigeons have been killed, retreats into a bird-like state.

Irish composer Frank Corcoran wrote a series of works between 1996 and 2003 around the tale. This includes the choral work &quot;Buile Suibhne / Mad Sweeney&quot; (1996, after Heaney), the electro-acoustic composition &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s Vision&quot; (1997), and the chamber work &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s Smithereens&quot; (2000).
French writer Pierre Michon retells the story of Suibhne&#x27;s levity in his 1997 collection &quot;Mythologies d&#x27;hiver&quot;.

In the 1999 young adult fantasy novel &quot;The Stones Are Hatching&quot; by Geraldine McCaughrean, Mad Sweeney is portrayed as having been traumatised by his experience fighting in the Napoleonic Wars.

Noah Mosley composed the opera &quot;Mad King Suibhne&quot; in 2017 produced by Bury Court Opera with a libretto by Ivo Mosley and it was also performed at Messum&#x27;s barn, Wiltshire.

<doc id="429511" wikidata="Q912422" url="?curid=429511" title="Inguinal canal">
<text>The inguinal canal is a passage in the anterior abdominal wall on each side of the body (one on each side of the midline), which in males, convey the spermatic cords and in females, the round ligament of the uterus. The inguinal canals are larger and more prominent in males.

==Structure==
The inguinal canals are situated just above the medial half of the inguinal ligament. The canals are approximately 4 to 6 cm long, angled anteroinferiorly and medially. In males, its diameter is normally 2 cm (±1 cm in standard deviation) at the deep inguinal ring.

A first-order approximation is to visualize each canal as a cylinder.

===Walls===
To help define the boundaries, these canals are often further approximated as boxes with six sides. Not including the two rings, the remaining four sides are usually called the &quot;anterior wall&quot;, &quot;inferior wall (&quot;floor&quot;)&quot;, &quot;superior wall (&quot;roof&quot;)&quot;, and &quot;posterior wall&quot;. These consist of the following:

===Deep inguinal ring===
The deep inguinal ring (internal or deep abdominal ring, abdominal inguinal ring, internal inguinal ring, &quot;annulus abdominalis&quot;) is the entrance to the inguinal canal.

====Location====
The surface marking of the deep inguinal ring is classically described as half an inch above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament.

However, the surface anatomy of the point is disputed. In a recent study, it was found to be in a region between the mid-inguinal point (situated midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis) and the midpoint of the inguinal ligament (i.e. midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle). Traditionally, either one of these two sites was claimed as its location. However, this claim is based upon the study&#x27;s dissection of 52 cadavers, and may not reflect the live &quot;in vivo&quot; anatomy.

Some sources state that it is at the layer of the transversalis fascia.

====Description====
The deep inguinal ring is an opening in the transversalis fascia. It is of an oval form, the long axis of the oval being vertical; it varies in size in different subjects, and is much larger in the male than in the female. It is bounded, above and laterally, by the arched lower margin of the transversalis fascia; below and medially, by the inferior epigastric vessels. It transmits the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament of the uterus in the female.

From its circumference, a thin funnel-shaped membrane, the infundibuliform fascia, is continued around the cord and testis, enclosing them in a distinct covering.

===Superficial inguinal ring===

The superficial inguinal ring (subcutaneous inguinal ring or external inguinal ring) is an anatomical structure in the anterior wall of the mammalian abdomen. It is a triangular opening that forms the exit of the inguinal canal, which houses the ilioinguinal nerve, the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve, and the spermatic cord (in men) or the round ligament (in women). At the other end of the canal, the deep inguinal ring forms the entrance.

It is found within the aponeurosis of the external oblique, immediately above the pubic crest, 1 centimeter above and superolateral to the pubic tubercle. 
It has the following boundaries—medial crura by pubic crest, lateral crura by pubic tubercle and inferiorly by inguinal ligament.

=== Contents ===
The structures which pass through the canals differ between males and females:
* in males: the spermatic cord and its coverings, and the ilioinguinal nerve.
* in females: the round ligament of the uterus, and the ilioinguinal nerve.

The classic description of the contents of the spermatic cords in the male are:

3 arteries: artery to vas deferens (or ductus deferens), testicular artery, cremasteric artery;

3 fascial layers: external spermatic, cremasteric, and internal spermatic fascia;

3 other structures: pampiniform plexus, vas deferens (ductus deferens), testicular lymphatics;

3 nerves: genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve (L1/2), sympathetic and visceral afferent fibres, ilioinguinal nerve (N.B. outside spermatic cord but travels next to it)

Note that the ilioinguinal nerve passes through the superficial ring to descend into the scrotum, but does not formally run through the canal.

===Development ===

==== In males ====
During development, each testicle descends from the starting point on the posterior abdominal wall (para-aortically) from the labioscrotal swellings near the kidneys, down the abdomen, and through the inguinal canals to reach the scrotum. This way, each testicle descends through the abdominal wall into the scrotum the processus vaginalis (which later obliterates).

==Clinical significance==

Abdominal contents (potentially including intestine) can be abnormally displaced from the abdominal cavity. Where these contents exit through the inguinal canal, having passed through the deep inguinal ring, the condition is known as an indirect or oblique inguinal hernia. This can also cause infertility. This condition is far more common in males than in females, owing to the inguinal canal&#x27;s small size in females.

A hernia that exits the abdominal cavity directly through the deep layers of the abdominal wall, thereby bypassing the inguinal canal, is known as a direct inguinal hernia.

In males with strong presentation of the cremasteric reflex, the testes can—during supine sexual activity or manual manipulation—partially or fully retract into the inguinal canal for a short period of time. In juveniles and adults with inguinal injury, retraction can be prolonged and potentially lead to overheating-related infertility.

The superficial ring is palpable under normal conditions. It becomes dilated in a condition called athletic pubalgia. Abdominal contents may protrude through the ring in inguinal hernia.

Thus lymphatic spread from a testicular tumour is to the para-aortic nodes first, and not the inguinal nodes.

==Biology==
* January 10 – John Gould reports to the Zoological Society of London that bird specimens brought by Charles Darwin from the Galápagos Islands which Darwin had thought were blackbirds, &quot;gross-bills&quot; and finches are in fact &quot;a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar&quot; as to form &quot;an entirely new group, containing 12 species&quot;, an important step in the inception of Darwin&#x27;s theory.

* Bernard Bolzano publishes &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;.
* William Rowan Hamilton treats complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers.
* Siméon Denis Poisson&#x27;s lectures on probability (introducing Poisson distribution) and decision theory are published.
* Pierre Wantzel proves that several ancient geometric problems (including doubling the cube and trisecting the angle) are impossible to solve using only compass and straightedge.

==Physics==
* Michael Faraday introduces the concept of lines of force.

==Technology==
* February 25 – Thomas Davenport obtains the first United States patent on an electric motor.
* May – Samuel Morse patents his telegraph and exhibits it to the United States Congress.
* June 12 – Cooke and Wheatstone file their patent for the electrical telegraph in the United Kingdom.
* July 19 – Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s paddle steamer is launched in Bristol.
* July – Godefroy Engelmann of Mulhouse patents chromolithography.
* November 18 – William Crompton patents the cotton power loom in the United States.
* Louis Daguerre&#x27;s daguerrotype &quot;L’Atelier de l&#x27;artiste&quot; is said to be the earliest known photographic image successfully to undergo the full process of exposure, development and fixation.
* Camille Polonceau patents the Polonceau truss.
* The first electric locomotive built is a miniature battery locomotive constructed by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen in Scotland, and powered by galvanic cells (batteries).

==Publications==
* Bernard Bolzano publishes his &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; (&quot;Theory of Science&quot;).
* Andrew Ure publishes his encyclopedia &quot;A Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures and Mines&quot; in the United Kingdom.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: Antoine-César Becquerel; John Frederic Daniell
* Wollaston Medal: Proby Thomas Cautley; Hugh Falconer

==Births==
* January 16 – Ellen Russell Emerson (died 1907), American ethnologist.
* January 17 – François Lenormant (died 1883), French assyriologist and numismatist.
* January 19 – William Williams Keen (died 1932), American physician.
* January 27 – Eduard von Hofmann (died 1897), Austrian forensic pathologist.
* March 7 – Henry Draper (died 1882), American physician and astronomer, pioneer of astrophotography.
* March 23 – Richard Anthony Proctor (died 1888), English astronomer.
* April 3 – John Burroughs (died 1921), American naturalist.
* April 27 – Paul Gordan (died 1912), German Jewish mathematician, &quot;the king of invariant theory&quot;.
* May 26 – Washington Roebling (died 1926), American civil engineer.
* June 20 – Paul Bachmann (died 1920), German mathematician.
* July 21 – Johanna Hedén (died 1912), Swedish midwife and surgeon.
* September 8 – Raphael Pumpelly (died 1923), American geologist and explorer.
* October 23 – Moritz Kaposi (died 1902), Hungarian dermatologist.
* November 4 – James Douglas (died 1918), Canadian-born metallurgist.
* November 14 – Lucas Barrett (died 1862), Canadian-born British naturalist.
* November 23 – Johannes Diderik van der Waals (died 1923), Dutch theoretical physicist.
* November 28 – John Wesley Hyatt (died 1920), American inventor and industrial chemist.

==Deaths==
* February 1 – Edward Donovan (born 1768), Anglo-Irish naturalist.
* February 4 – John Latham (born 1740), English physician, naturalist and &quot;grandfather of Australian ornithology&quot;.
* February 16 – Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (born 1776), German naturalist and advocate of transmutation.
* February 19 – Georg Büchner (born 1813), German-born writer and anatomist (typhus).

<doc id="429519" wikidata="Q147129" url="?curid=429519" title="Zao (American band)">
<text>Zao () is an American metalcore band founded in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and later relocated to Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Founded in March 1993, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, vocalist Dan Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by some fans as the &quot;core&quot; of Zao, with the current line up being the longest running in the band&#x27;s history.

For a time, the band featured Christian themes in their music and was regarded as a Christian band, however this theme was eventually met with debate among the members and the band currently no longer considers themselves a &quot;Christian band&quot; with only bassist Martin Lunn identifying as a Christian.

To date, Zao has released 11 full-length albums, 9 EPs or splits, a two-disc DVD documentary and embarked on numerous concert tours, garnering a limited but global fan base and earning critical praise in the process.

==History==

===The first era (1993–1997)===
The founding members of Zao, were vocalist Eric Reeder, guitarist Roy Goudy, bassist Mic Cox, and drummer Jesse Smith. The band&#x27;s name comes from the Greek word , which means &#x27;alive&#x27; or &#x27;to have life&#x27;. Zao vocalist Eric Reeder has been credited with coming up with the band&#x27;s name. Calling their sound &quot;Christ-centered hardcore&quot;, they sought to reach an audience that they felt has been pushed away from the organized church. Most of their early songs, which appeared on their first two full-length albums, &quot;All Else Failed&quot; and &quot;The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation&quot; (which saw the band re-recording much of the &quot;All Else Failed&quot; material), contained explicit references to God and centered on the theme of the peace of God. Reeder (who appeared on Zao&#x27;s Author and Sustained demos, as well as a split with Outcast) left before Zao recorded &quot;All Else Failed&quot; and was replaced by Shawn Jonas, who went on to form Symphony in Peril. Jonas left the band after recording two albums and is now a youth pastor at New Life Church in West Virginia; original bassist Mic Cox left the band, and Kevin Moran took his place. Ron Gray also joined the band as a second guitarist after the recording of &quot;The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation&quot;. All of the band members, except for drummer Jesse Smith, quit Zao following the 1997 Cornerstone festival and a couple of shows they played on the way back home.

===The second era (1998–2002) ===

In 1998, Smith recruited Brett Detar, guitarist of Pennsylvania emocore band Pensive, to help him build a new incarnation of Zao. Detar suggested a pair of his friends, guitarist Russ Cogdell and vocalist Dan Weyandt. Both Cogdell and Weyandt had played in Christian hardcore band Seasons in the Field, who had released a split EP with Pensive. Smith would drive several hours to Greensburg, where all these new members lived, to co-write and rehearse what would become the first (and in many ways, defining) album from the new Zao, &quot;Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest&quot;. The group played fewer and fewer songs from the old version of the band as &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; took hold. When it came time to embark on tour for the band&#x27;s new lineup, Moran, who had continued with the band up until this point, departed, which led to the band touring without a bassist. The band set stages ablaze with their raw emotion and Weyandt&#x27;s personal storytelling, which detailed the hardships that informed their songs. With a rockabilly look and Smith&#x27;s oddly engaging habit of setting up his drums facing away from the audience, their live reputation grew large in the underground. Not long after recording their half of a split EP with labelmates Training for Utopia in California, Detar left the group in 1999 to focus his energy on his rock side-project The Juliana Theory, who would sign to Sony and have a successful career before disbanding in 2006.

Following Detar&#x27;s departure, Smith expressed interest in putting the band on a brief hiatus, which led to Weyandt and Cogdell forming a new project called Eight Stars for Elijah in the vein of Sunny Day Real Estate. Scott Mellinger (formerly of Creation Is Crucifixion) played guitars in the band, alongside Weyandt, while Cogdell played drums, alongside friend Tim on bass. However, at the same time the bassist moved to Florida, Smith returned with the proposition of bringing Zao back to record a new album. Weyandt and Cogdell pushed for Mellinger to join the band, to which Smith agreed. Mellinger joined the band on lead guitar and Rob Horner, a longtime friend of Smith&#x27;s, came in on bass. With this lineup at hand, the band would enter the studio to record another seminal metalcore album, &quot;Liberate Te Ex Inferis&quot; (Latin for &quot;Save Yourself from Hell&quot;, a line from the movie &quot;Event Horizon&quot;), which came out through Solid State Records. According to Weyandt, the lyrical themes were very dark on the record, which led to him lying to certain people about what the songs were actually written about. After the album was recorded, Cogdell left the band in 2000 to go to film school, while Weyandt also quit the band to work as a tattoo artist. The band would then embark on tour with Today is the Day and Nile following their departure, which led to Mellinger, Horner, and Smith hiring Corey Darst on vocals for the tour.

Once the band returned from tour, they traveled to the studio to record Zao&#x27;s fifth album titled &quot;Self-Titled&quot;, with Weyandt coming by for a few days to contribute his lyrics and vocals. By this point, Weyandt returned to the band with Darst being replaced. The album is notable for Smith&#x27;s dark pop interludes, the V-Drum sound and the song &quot;Five Year Winter&quot;, which remains a signature Zao song. When the band traveled to the studio at Barry Poynter, the band had only written two songs by the time they arrived. &quot;Five Year Winter&quot; had been written on the car ride down to the studio, which was in Little Rock, Arkansas. Only Mellinger and Smith wrote and recorded the material. In hindsight, Mellinger expressed that he wishes he could re-record the album with live drums and change other small things. The initial title for the album was &quot;Alive Is Dead&quot;, but due to The Juliana Theory&#x27;s &quot;Emotion is Dead&quot; being released, they did not want to give the impression they were copying them. Corey Darst replaced Weyandt for the majority of the touring in support of the album, with Horner returning, and second guitarist Matt Auxier joining up. Darst never appeared on a Zao album although this version of the group (Darst, Smith, Mellinger and Horner) did cut a three-song demo during a Seattle tour stop. The group talked about signing with either Sanctuary or Century Media Records, but Zao &quot;broke up&quot; on stage at a December 2001 show in Pittsburgh (later documented on their DVD). They were to embark on a tour with The Juliana Theory and Weyandt had joined Darst onstage as a special guest, but an incapacitated Jesse Smith could not make it through the show and long-brewing tensions boiled over.

Smith, however, once again, contacted Solid State Records and Tooth &amp; Nail Records funded the next Zao projects: a brand new album that featured just Smith, Mellinger, and Weyandt called &quot;Parade of Chaos&quot;, as well as a re-recording of the original Zao&#x27;s &quot;All Else Failed&quot; played by the same trio. In the documentary &quot;The Lesser Lights of Heaven&quot;, the band disavowed the re-recording, admitting they did it because they were broke and needed to fulfill their record contract with Solid State. &quot;Parade of Chaos&quot; was considered to be a &quot;half-hearted&quot; release, due to the members&#x27; being burned out on the band and that it was planned to fulfill their contract. Smith and Mellinger were the only members at the time and had attempted to figure out who they wanted on vocals, with Darst and Ryan Downey of Burn It Down (later their manager with Superhero Management) being considered. Downey convinced Smith that Weyandt needed to be a part of the album. Weyandt recorded both &quot;Parade of Chaos&quot; and &quot;All Else Failed&quot; within three days. Following the album&#x27;s release, Weyandt, Mellinger, Smith and a returning Cogdell set-out on the &quot;Burn It Down and Walk Away Tour&quot;, billed as Zao&#x27;s &quot;final&quot; tour, with support from special guests Underoath, Unearth, Dead Poetic, and The Underwater. Although technically a tour in support of &quot;Parade of Chaos&quot; as well, no songs from the album were featured in the set-list. After the 2002 tour, the group&#x27;s members focused on other projects, most notably Cogdell and Mellinger&#x27;s more rock-oriented Jade Meridian and Horner&#x27;s two-year stint with the Wheeling, West Virginia sci-fi metal band The Minus Tide.

===The third era (2003–2006)===

However, the &quot;Liberate&quot; era lineup reconvened in Greensburg around the promise of a new record label that offered to fund a new Zao album. The &quot;label&quot; ended up falling apart before a note of music was ever recorded, prompting Smith to reach out to Ferret Music who agreed to sign the band to a two-album deal. After cutting some new demos, Weyandt left the group, due to some issues with addiction at the time. Society&#x27;s Finest singer Joshua Ashworth was asked by Smith to join the group. This version of Zao did a few shows and recorded a couple of songs. Living Sacrifice drummer Lance Garvin filled in for Smith when the rest of the guys could not find him for a couple of 2003 festival dates. However, by the end of 2003, Cogdell and Mellinger realized they did not want to make a Zao record without Dan on vocals. Smith and Horner quit Zao and joined up with former bassist Kevin Moran to focus on their new band, Gods. Ashworth stepped aside. With Weyandt back on board, the remaining three &quot;core&quot; members recruited the rhythm section from Jade Meridian (bass player Shawn Koschick, drummer Stephen Peck) to round-out the Zao lineup. At this time the band started to write their 7th album. For a time, the band could not find a bassist or a drummer, with talks of Cogdell playing drums if they could not find someone.

In 2004, Zao released &quot;The Funeral of God&quot; — a concept album that imagined a world where God had chosen to abandon mankind. Ferret heavily advertised the album, the group made their first music video (for &quot;The Rising End&quot;), and went on several tours of the US, resulting in the biggest selling Zao album to date. Though they had played a few shows there before, Zao did their first-ever extensive European headlining tour with this lineup. Shawn told the band he would be leaving just before the &quot;Praise the War Machine&quot; US headlining tour, but he did complete the tour. The sold-out show at Glasshouse in Pomona, CA was filmed for the band&#x27;s in-the-works DVD. Longtime friend, tour manager, and former Pensive member Marty Lunn took over the bass position before Zao co-headlined the &quot;City of Champions&quot; tour with The Juliana Theory. The following year, Stephen Peck told the band he was quitting two weeks before they were set to leave for the UK to tour with Bleeding Through. Scrambling to find a replacement, the group hired local drummer Jeff Gretz. Weyandt worked close by to Gretz&#x27;s place of employment and evidently left Gretz a note that the band needed a drummer. The UK tour was followed by the &quot;Strhess Tour&quot; across the US in the summer of 2005 with Bleeding Through, Darkest Hour and Misery Signals. The Los Angeles and San Diego shows were recorded for the upcoming DVD. In 2005, the band released their DVD, &quot;The Lesser Lights of Heaven&quot;, mapping their history up till that point, having members from different bands, including: Don and Ryan Clark (Demon Hunter, Training for Utopia), Bruce Fitzhugh (Living Sacrifice), Chris McLane (Stretch Arm Strong), Jimmy Ryan (Haste the Day, Trenches), and CJ Anderson (Sinai Beach), as well as Ferrett Music&#x27;s staff and Roy Culver of Solid State Records.

In January 2006, Weyandt, Mellinger, Lunn, and Gretz traveled to Chicago to record their next album with one of their collective heroes, Steve Albini. The making of &quot;The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here&quot; was documented for a limited edition DVD. The band set out with the goal of recording an album that felt like a band and not individual members recording their parts separately, as well as having an album with no &quot;filler songs&quot;. Directly after recording, Zao hit the road with In Flames, Trivium and DevilDriver. After that, they co-headlined their second &quot;Ferret Music Tour&quot;. However, they were forced to head home early after Weyandt severely injured his hand. &quot;The Fear...&quot; was released in June while Zao was on tour with Demon Hunter. The band filmed a video for &quot;My Love, My Love (We&#x27;ve Come Back from the Dead)&quot;, a self-described &quot;zombie love story&quot;, during that tour. The fall of 2006 saw Zao touring with Throwdown, Evergreen Terrace and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster. During the tour, Mellinger and Weyandt both agreed that Zao should embark on a long break after the tour. Eager to continue touring, Gretz left Zao not long after and became the drummer for From Autumn to Ashes. Gretz states that he only announced his departure as Zao was becoming inactive and he wanted to continue working and that no one would hire him if they believed he was still a full-time member of Zao.

===The fourth era (2007–2009)===
On January 23, 2007, Zao announced in a lengthy statement that Russ Cogdell had rejoined the band after recovering from his knee surgery. Zao stated that they would not fill the drum position. Josh Walters, formerly of The Juliana Theory, would fill-in if/when the band next appeared live. The band said they had completed their two-album deal with Ferret Music but did not say who would be releasing their next album. There was no news on whether they intended to re-sign to Ferret or seek a new label. Not long after the statement was released, the band said that Walters would in fact not be performing with them.

In mid-2008, Zao played their first show since 2006 with Demon Hunter at Mr. Smalls in Pittsburgh, PA. The lineup for the show was Weyandt, Mellinger, Lunn and Gretz. Following this, they began recording their new album, &quot;Awake?&quot;, with Scott Mellinger, Daniel Castleman and As I Lay Dying singer Tim Lambesis co-producing. The guitars and bass were all engineered by Mellinger, vocals engineered by Dave Hidek, and the drums were engineered by Castleman. The band finished vocal recording in November 2008 with engineer Dave Hidek at Treelady Studios, located in Pittsburgh, PA. According to Gretz, Lambesis was not highly involved in the production, with Daniel Castleman being very hands-on. The band released the album on May 5, 2009, on Ferret Records.

===The fifth era (2010–present)===
The band took to the web updating the world on the status of the band, as it stands, ZAO is Daniel Weyandt, Scott Mellinger, Russ Cogdell, Marty Lunn and Jeff Gretz. Among other things in the recent update, the band said they were extremely surprised at how well their last album, &quot;Awake?&quot;, did in the market considering it had no tour support by them and that it was thrown onto Ferret&#x27;s label in the 11th hour. Zao said the best thing to come out of it is that they learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans still enjoy their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music. According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album. Guitar tracking began in January 2015. &quot;Xenophobe&quot;, the band&#x27;s first EP since 1998, was released on July 10, 2015.

On October 13, 2016, the band released &quot;Observed/Observer&quot;, the second song that would be on &quot;The Well-Intentioned Virus&quot;, the first being &quot;Xenophobe&quot;. The band premiered the next song, &quot;A Well-Intentioned Virus&quot;, on October 27, 2016. On December 1, 2016, the band released the album stream for &quot;The Well-Intentioned Virus&quot;. The band announced an EP, &quot;Pyrrhic Victory&quot;, which was released on November 3, 2017.

In the first half of 2018, Zao announced that their 2004 album &quot;The Funeral of God&quot; would be released on vinyl by Tragic Hero Records, but this release got caught up in legal issues and has yet to be released. On September 21, 2018, the band released a split 7-inch vinyl with Yashira through American record label Mind Over Matter Records, which included the songs &quot;Hide From the Light&quot; (Zao) and &quot;Led to Ache&quot; (Yashira). They followed this split up with a 7-inch EP entitled &quot;Decoding Transmissions From the Möbius Strip&quot; on February 8, 2019, which included the tracks &quot;Transmission 1: I Saw The End&quot; and &quot;Transmission 2: I Saw The Devil.&quot; The same announcement by the band hinted at a new album in the works. Starting in August 2019, the band is embarking on a Midwest tour of the United States with Hollow Earth and Wolf King. On November 15, 2019, the band released &quot;Reformat/Reboot&quot;, a remix album featuring eight remixed tracks from &quot;The Well-Intentioned Virus&quot;. It was released on numerous formats including a Nintendo Entertainment System game cartridge. On April 9, 2021, the band released their eleventh studio album, &quot;The Crimson Corridor&quot;, the band&#x27;s second release with their independent label, Observed/Observer Recordings.

==Religion==
Christianity has been a key influence in the band&#x27;s early work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band with second vocalist Shawn Jonas often preaching Christianity between songs, which changed as time passed and members changed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band&#x27;s vision with citing wanting to be able to play to more secular music scenes and providing less emphasis on religion because he felt the original line-up would &quot;force it down peoples throats.&quot; Upon vocalist Daniel Weyandt joining the band; the lyrics shifted to more personal content albeit initially still retaining an occasional Christian message which became less prevalent with every album. Because only bassist Martin Lunn identifies as Christian, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists with guitarist Scott Mellinger going on record and stating that Zao would prefer to just be known as a Metal band.

Lyrics in future productions may or may not include Christian messages, but Zao has stated they would have loved to return to the Christian Cornerstone Festival when it was still active. As of 2015, only one member of the band (bassist Martin Lunn) claims Christianity as their beliefs. 

Certain members have gone on to state that they had never held the Christian belief, including Mellinger and longtime Bassist Rob Horner. Although it was previously stated that he was not a Christian upon his joining, Jeff Gretz stated that he was raised Catholic and that he &quot;never said he never believed.&quot;

<text>Minoxidil is a medication used for the treatment of high blood pressure and pattern hair loss. It is an antihypertensive and a vasodilator. It is available as a generic medication by prescription in oral tablet form and over-the-counter as a topical liquid or foam.

==Medical uses==
Minoxidil, when used for hypertension, is generally reserved for use in severe hypertension patients who do not respond to at least two agents and a diuretic. Minoxidil is also generally administered with a loop diuretic to prevent sodium and potassium retention. It may also cause a reflex tachycardia and thus is prescribed with a beta blocker.

=== Hair loss ===
Minoxidil, when applied topically, is used for the treatment of hair loss. It is effective in helping promote hair growth in people with androgenic alopecia regardless of sex. Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth.

Low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) is used off-label against hair loss and to promote hair regrowth. Oral minoxidil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment alternative for patients having difficulty with topical formulations.

==Side effects==
Topically applied minoxidil is generally well tolerated, but common side effects include itching of the eyes, general itching, irritation at the treated area, and unwanted hair growth elsewhere on the body.

Alcohol and propylene glycol present in some topical preparations may dry the scalp, resulting in dandruff and contact dermatitis.

Side effects of oral minoxidil may include swelling of the face and extremities, rapid heartbeat, or lightheadedness. Cardiac lesions, such as focal necrosis of the papillary muscle and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle, have been observed in laboratory animals treated with minoxidil. Pseudoacromegaly is an extremely rare side effect reported with large doses of oral minoxidil.

In 2013 or 2014, a seven-year-old girl was admitted to a children&#x27;s hospital in Toulouse in France after accidentally ingesting a teaspoon of Alopexy (a brand name for minoxidil in France). The child vomited constantly after ingestion and showed hypotension and tachycardia for 40 hours. The authors of the report on the incident stressed that the product should be kept out of reach of children, and urged manufacturers to consider more secure child-resistant packaging.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood. Minoxidil is an adenosine 5&#x27;-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener, causing hyperpolarization of cell membranes. Theoretically, by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, it allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the follicles. Moreover, minoxidil contains a nitric oxide moiety and may act as a nitric oxide agonist. This may cause follicles in the telogen phase to shed, which are then replaced by thicker hairs in a new anagen phase. Minoxidil is a prodrug that is converted by sulfation via the sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1 to its active form, minoxidil sulfate. The effect of minoxidil is mediated by adenosine, which triggers intracellular signal transduction via both adenosine A1 receptors and two sub-types of adenosine A2 receptors (A2A and A2B receptors). Minoxidil acts as an activator of the Kir6/SUR2 channel upon selective binding to SUR2. The expression of SUR2B in dermal papilla cells might play a role in the production of adenosine. Minoxidil induces cell growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, IGF-1 and potentiates HGF and IGF-1 actions by the activation of uncoupled sulfonylurea receptor on the plasma membrane of dermal papilla cells.

A number of &quot;in vitro&quot; effects of minoxidil have been described in monocultures of various skin and hair follicle cell types including stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of collagen synthesis, and stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, prostaglandin synthesis and leukotriene B4 expression.

Minoxidil causes a redistribution of cellular iron through its apparent capacity to bind this metal ion. By binding iron in a Fenton-reactive form, intracellular hydroxyl radical production would ensue, but hydroxyl would be immediately trapped and scavenged by the minoxidil to generate a nitroxyl radical. It is presumed that this nitroxyl radical will be capable of reduction by glutathione to reform minoxidil. Such a process would cycle until the minoxidil is otherwise metabolized and would result in rapid glutathione depletion with glutathione disulphide formation and therefore with concomitant consumption of NADPH/NADH and other reducing equivalents. Minoxidil inhibited PHD by interfering with the normal function of ascorbate, a cofactor of the enzyme, leading to a stabilization of HIF-1α protein and a subsequent activation of HIF-1. In an in vivo angiogenesis assay, millimolar minoxidil increased blood vessel formation in a VEGF-dependent manner. Minoxidil inhibition of PHD occurs via interrupting ascorbate binding to iron. The structural feature of positioning amines adjacent to nitric oxide may confer the ability of millimolar minoxidil to chelate iron, thereby inhibiting PHD. Minoxidil is capable of tetrahydrobiopterin inhibition as a cofactor for nitric oxide synthase.

Minoxidil stimulates prostaglandin E2 production by activating COX-1 and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 but inhibits prostacyclin production. Additionally, expression of the prostaglandin E2 receptor, the most upregulated target gene in the β-catenin pathway of DP cells, was enhanced by minoxidil, which may enable hair follicles to grow continuously and maintain the anagen phase.

Due to the anti-fibrotic activity of minoxidil inhibition of enzyme lysyl hydroxylase present in fibroblast may result in the synthesis of a hydroxylysine-deficient collagen. Minoxidil can also potentially stimulate elastogenesis in aortic smooth muscle cells, and in skin fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. In hypertensive rats, minoxidil increases elastin levels in the mesenteric, abdominal, and renal arteries by a decrease in elastase enzyme activity in these tissues. In rats, potassium channel openers decrease calcium influx which inhibits elastin gene transcription through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2)-activator protein 1 signaling pathway. ERK 1/2 increases, through elastin gene transcription, adequately cross-linked elastic fiber content synthesized by smooth muscle cells, and decreases the number of cells in the aorta.

Minoxidil possesses α2-adrenergic receptor agonist activity, stimulates the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (SNS) by way of carotid and aortic baroreceptor reflexes. Minoxidil administration also brings an increase in plasma renin activity, largely due to the aforementioned activation of the SNS. This activation of the renin-angiotensin axis further prompts increased biosynthesis of aldosterone; whereas plasma and urinary aldosterone levels are increased early in the course of treatment with minoxidil, over time these values tend to normalize presumably because of accelerated metabolic clearance of aldosterone in association with hepatic vasodilation.

Minoxidil may be involved in the inhibition of serotonin 5-HT2 receptors.

Minoxidil might increase blood-tumor barrier permeability in a time-dependent manner by down-regulating tight junction protein expression and this effect could be related to ROS/RhoA/PI3K/PKB signal pathway. Minoxidil significantly increases ROS concentration when compared to untreated cells.

In vitro Minoxidil treatment resulted in a 0.22 fold change for 5α-R2 (p &lt; 0.0001). This antiandrogenic effect of minoxidil, shown by significant downregulation of 5α-R2 gene expression in HaCaT cells, may be one of its mechanisms of action in alopecia.

Minoxidil is less effective when the area of hair loss is large. In addition, its effectiveness has largely been demonstrated in younger men who have experienced hair loss for less than 5 years. Minoxidil use is indicated for central (vertex) hair loss only. Two clinical studies are being conducted in the US for a medical device that may allow patients to determine if they are likely to benefit from minoxidil therapy.

Conditions such as Cantú syndrome have been shown to mimic the pharmacological properties of minoxidil.

==Chemistry==
Minoxidil is an odorless, white to off-white, crystalline powder (crystals from methanol-acetonitrile). When heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides. It decomposes at 259-261 °C.

Solubility (mg/ml): propylene glycol 75, methanol 44, ethanol 29, 2-propanol 6.7, dimethylsulfoxide 6.5, water 2.2, chloroform 0.5, acetone &lt;0.5, ethyl acetate &lt;0.5, diethyl ether &lt;0.5, benzene &lt;0.5, acetonitrile &lt;0.5.

formula_1 4.61

Minoxidil, 6-amino-1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-imino-4-piperidinopyrimidine, is synthesized from barbituric acid, the reaction of which with phosphorus oxychloride gives 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine. Upon reaction with ammonium, this turns into 2,4-diamino-6-chloropyrimidine. Next, the resulting 2,4-diamino-6-chloropyrimidine undergoes a reaction with 2,4-dichlorophenol in the presence of potassium hydroxide, giving 2,4-diamino-6-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-pyrimidine. Oxidation of this product with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid gives 2,4-diamino-6-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)pyrimidine-3-oxide, the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyl group of which is replaced with a piperidine group at high temperature, giving minoxidil.

Another synthesis approach is depicted here:
==History==

===Initial application===
Minoxidil was developed in the late 1950s by the Upjohn Company (later became part of Pfizer) to treat ulcers. In trials using dogs, the compound did not cure ulcers but proved to be a powerful vasodilator. Upjohn synthesized over 200 variations of the compound, including the one it developed in 1963 and named minoxidil. These studies resulted in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving minoxidil (with the brand name Loniten) in the form of oral tablets to treat high blood pressure in 1979.

===Hair growth===
When Upjohn received permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to test the new drug as medicine for hypertension they approached Charles A. Chidsey, at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He conducted two studies, the second study showing unexpected hair growth. Puzzled by this side-effect, Chidsey consulted Guinter Kahn (who while a dermatology resident at the University of Miami had been the first to observe and report hair development on patients using the minoxidil patch) and discussed the possibility of using minoxidil for treating hair loss.

Kahn, along with his colleague Paul J. Grant, had obtained a certain amount of minoxidil and conducted their own research, since they were first to make the side effect observation. Neither Upjohn or Chidsey at the time were aware of the side effect of hair growth. The two doctors had been experimenting with a 1% solution of minoxidil mixed with several alcohol-based liquids. Both parties filed patents to use minoxidil for hair loss prevention, which resulted in a decade-long trial between Kahn and Upjohn, which ended with Kahn&#x27;s name included in a consolidated patent (U.S. #4,596,812 Charles A Chidsey, III and Guinter Kahn) in 1986 and royalties from the company to both Kahn and Grant.

Meanwhile, the effect of minoxidil on hair loss prevention was so clear that in the 1980s physicians were prescribing Loniten off-label to their balding patients.

In August 1988, the FDA approved minoxidil for treating baldness in men under the brand name &quot;Rogaine&quot; (FDA rejected Upjohn&#x27;s first choice, Regain, as misleading). The agency concluded that although &quot;the product will not work for everyone&quot;, 39% of the men studied had &quot;moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of the head&quot;. &quot;Men&#x27;s Rogaine&quot;, marketed by Johnson &amp; Johnson went off-patent on January 20, 2006.

In 1991, Upjohn made the product available for women. &quot;Women&#x27;s Rogaine&quot;, marketed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, went off-patent in February 2014.

=== Pericardial effusion ===
Minoxidil has been implicated in causing pericardial effusions including life-threatening cases of cardiac tamponade. There have been case reports dating back to the 1980s describing this phenomenon, including topical. and oral formulations. The frequency of these occurrences has previously been reported at 3% but the true frequency is difficult to determine as a large proportion of patients in this cohort also had renal insufficiency and may have had an effusion preceding the use of minoxidil.

==Society and culture==

=== Economics ===
In February 1996, the FDA approved both the over-the-counter sale and the production of generic formulations of minoxidil. Upjohn replied to that by lowering prices to half the price of the prescription drug and by releasing a prescription 5% formula of Rogaine in 1997. In 1998, a 5% formulation of minoxidil was approved for nonprescription sale by the FDA. The 5% aerosol foam formula was approved for medical use in the US in 2006. The generic versions of the 5% aerosol foam formula were approved in 2017.

In 2017, a study of pharmacy prices in four states for 41 over-the-counter minoxidil products which were &quot;gender-specified&quot; found that the mean price for minoxidil solutions was the same for women and men even though the women&#x27;s formulations were 2% and the men&#x27;s were 5%, while the mean price for minoxidil foams, which were all 5%, was 40% higher for women. The authors noted this was the first time gender-based pricing had been shown for a medication.

== Research ==
Minoxidil is being investigated as a potential treatment for ovarian cancer.

== Toxicity to animals ==
Minoxidil is highly toxic to dogs and cats, even in doses as small as a drop or lick. There are reported cases of cats dying shortly after coming in contact with minimal amounts of the substance.

There is no specific antidote, but lipid rescue has been used successfully.

<text>Voles are small rodents that are relatives of lemmings and hamsters, but with a stouter body; a longer, hairy tail; a slightly rounder head; smaller eyes and ears; and differently formed molars (high-crowned with angular cusps instead of low-crowned with rounded cusps). They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice.

Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. There are approximately 155 different vole species.

==Description==
Voles are small rodents that grow to , depending on the species. Females can have five to ten litters per year, though with an average lifespan of three months and requiring one month to adulthood, two litters is the norm. Gestation lasts for three weeks and the young voles reach sexual maturity in a month. As a result of this biological exponential growth, vole populations can grow very large within a short time. One mating pair can produce 100 offspring in a year.

Voles outwardly resemble several other small animals. Moles, gophers, mice, rats and even shrews have similar characteristics and behavioral tendencies.

Voles thrive on small plants yet, like shrews, they will eat dead animals and, like mice and rats, they can live on almost any nut or fruit. In addition, voles target plants more than most other small animals, making their presence evident. Voles readily girdle small trees and ground cover much like a porcupine. This girdling can easily kill young plants and is not healthy for trees and other shrubs.

Voles often eat succulent root systems and burrow under plants and eat away until the plant is dead. Bulbs are another favorite target for voles; their excellent burrowing and tunnelling skills give them access to sensitive areas without clear or early warning. The presence of large numbers of voles is often identifiable only after they have destroyed a number of plants. However, like other burrowing rodents, they also play beneficial roles, including dispersing nutrients throughout the upper soil layers.

==Predators==
Many predators eat voles, including martens, owls, hawks, falcons, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, raccoons, squirrels, snakes, weasels, domestic cats and lynxes. Vole bones are often found in the pellets of the short-eared owl, the northern spotted owl, the saw-whet owl, the barn owl, the great gray owl, and the northern pygmy owl. In the summer of 2024, biologists and other scientists at UC Davis first observed California ground squirrels actively hunting voles.

==Lifespan==

The average lifespan for smaller species of vole is three to six months, and they rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the European water vole, live longer and usually die during their second, or rarely their third, winter. As many as 88% of voles are estimated to die within the first month of life.

==Genetics and sexual behavior==
The prairie vole is a notable animal model for its monogamous social fidelity, since the male is usually socially faithful to the female, and shares in the raising of pups. The woodland vole is also usually monogamous. Another species from the same genus, the meadow vole, has promiscuously mating males, and scientists have changed adult male meadow voles&#x27; behavior to resemble that of prairie voles in experiments in which a viral vector was used to increase a single gene&#x27;s expression within a particular brain region. 

The behavior is influenced by the number of repetitions of a particular string of microsatellite DNA. Male prairie voles with the longest DNA strings spend more time with their mates and pups than male prairie voles with shorter strings. However, other scientists have disputed the gene&#x27;s relationship to monogamy, and cast doubt on whether the human version plays an analogous role. Physiologically, pair-bonding behavior has been shown to be connected to vasopressin, dopamine, and oxytocin levels, with the genetic influence apparently arising via the number of receptors for these substances in the brain; the pair-bonding behavior has also been shown in experiments to be strongly modifiable by administering some of these substances directly.

Voles have a number of unusual chromosomal traits. Species have been found with 17 to 64 chromosomes. In some species, males and females have different chromosome numbers, a trait unusual in mammals, though it is seen in other organisms. Additionally, genetic material typically found on the Y chromosome has been found in both males and females in at least one species. In another species, the X chromosome contains 20% of the genome. All of these variations result in very little physical aberration; most vole species are virtually indistinguishable. In one species, the creeping vole &quot;Microtus oregoni&quot;, it was discovered the Y chromosome has been lost entirely; the male-determining chromosome is actually a second X that is largely identical to the female X, and both the maternally inherited and male-specific sex chromosomes carry vestiges of the ancestral Y. This is quite unusual in mammals, as the XY system is fairly stable across a number of mammal species.

==Mating system==
Voles may be either monogamous or polygamous, which leads to differing patterns of mate choice and parental care. Environmental conditions play a large part in dictating which system is active in a given population. Voles live in colonies due to the young remaining in the family group for relatively long periods. In the genus &quot;Microtus&quot;, monogamy is preferred when resources are spatially homogeneous and population densities are low; where the opposites of both conditions are realized, polygamous tendencies arise. Vole mating systems are also sensitive to the operational sex ratio and tend toward monogamy when males and females are present in equal numbers. Where one sex is more numerous than the other, polygamy is more likely. However the most marked effect on mating system is population density and these effects can take place both inter and intra-specifically.

Male voles are territorial and tend to include territories of several female voles when possible. Under these conditions polygyny exists and males offer little parental care. Males mark and aggressively defend their territories since females prefer males with the most recent marking in a given area.

Voles prefer familiar mates through olfactory sensory exploitation. Monogamous voles prefer males who have yet to mate, while non-monogamous voles do not. Mate preference in voles develops through cohabitation in as little as 24 hours. This drives young male voles to show non-limiting preference toward female siblings. This is not inclusive to females&#x27; preference for males which may help to explain the absence of interbreeding indicators.

Although females show little territoriality, under pair bonding conditions they tend to show aggression toward other female voles. This behavior is flexible as some &quot;Microtus&quot; females share dens during the winter months, perhaps to conserve heat and energy. Populations which are monogamous show relatively minor size differences between genders compared with those using polygamous systems.

The grey-sided vole (&quot;Myodes rufocanus&quot;) exhibits male-biased dispersal as a means of avoiding incestuous matings. Among those matings that involve inbreeding, the number of weaned juveniles in litters is significantly fewer than that from noninbred litters, due to inbreeding depression.

Brandt&#x27;s vole (&quot;Lasiopodomys brandtii&quot;) lives in groups that mainly consist of close relatives. However, they show no sign of inbreeding. The mating system of these voles involves a type of polygyny for males and extra-group polyandry for females. This system increases the frequency of mating among distantly related individuals, and is achieved mainly by dispersal during the mating season. Such a strategy is likely an adaptation to avoid the inbreeding depression that would be caused by expression of deleterious recessive alleles if close relatives mated.

== Empathy and consolation ==
A 2016 study into the behavior of voles, &quot;Microtus ochrogaster&quot; specifically, found that voles comfort each other when mistreated, spending more time grooming a mistreated vole. Voles that were not mistreated had levels of stress hormones that were similar to the voles that had been mistreated, suggesting that the voles were capable of empathizing with each other. This was further proven by blocking the vole&#x27;s receptors for oxytocin, a hormone involved in empathy. When the oxytocin receptors were blocked this behavior stopped.

This type of empathetic behavior has previously been thought to occur only in animals with advanced cognition such as humans, apes, and elephants.

<doc id="429531" wikidata="Q551478" url="?curid=429531" title="Charlie Daniels">
<text>Charles Edward Daniels (October 28, 1936 – July 6, 2020) was an American singer, musician, and songwriter. His music fused rock, country, blues and jazz, and was a pioneering contribution to Southern rock and progressive country. He was best known for his number-one country hit &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;. Much of his output, including all but one of his eight &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charting singles, was credited to the Charlie Daniels Band.

Daniels was active as a singer and musician from the 1950s until his death. He was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame in 2002, the Grand Ole Opry in 2008, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009, and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2016.

== Early life ==

Charles Edward Daniels was born October 28, 1936, in Wilmington, North Carolina, to teenage parents William and LaRue Daniel. The &quot;s&quot; in Daniels&#x27; name was added by mistake when his birth certificate was filled out. Two weeks after Daniels had begun to attend elementary school, his family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, commuting between Valdosta and Elizabethtown, North Carolina, before moving back to Wilmington. After enduring measles, Daniels would require glasses to see for most of his life afterward, which led to him being bullied by other children at his school. Influenced by Pentecostal gospel, local bluegrass music groups and rhythm and blues artists that he heard on the radio, as well as Western films, Daniels began writing and performing songs.

==Career==
===Sideman career and first rock band===
Daniels began his music career as a member of the bluegrass band Misty Mountain Boys in the 1950s, already skilled on guitar, fiddle, banjo, and mandolin, In the 1960s, Daniels was performing rock and roll. Daniels formed his own band, the Rockets, who later changed their name to the Jaguars after scoring a hit single with the instrumental recording &quot;Jaguar&quot;. After discovering jazz, the Jaguars began performing jazz music, before reverting to rock and country music by 1964. During his career as a rock and roll sideman, Daniels also wrote songs for other performers. In July 1963, soul singer Jerry Jackson recorded Daniels&#x27; song &quot;It Hurts Me&quot;; the following year, on January 12, 1964, Elvis Presley recorded the better known recording of Daniels&#x27; song. The songwriting credits list Charles E. Daniels and Joy Byers as the songwriters, although Byers&#x27; husband, songwriter and producer Bob Johnston, was the actual co-writer with Daniels. Johnston encouraged Daniels to move to Nashville in order to get work as a session player, which led to Daniels recording with Bob Dylan on his 1969 album &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, Ringo Starr on his 1970 album &quot;Beaucoups of Blues&quot; and Leonard Cohen on his 1971 album &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;, as well as further sessions with Dylan and Cohen&#x27;s 1971 tour. Dylan and Daniels found each other creatively invigorating during their recordings together, with Dylan saying that &quot;when Charlie was around, something good would usually come out of the sessions&quot;, and Daniels describing the recording sessions with Dylan as &quot;loose, free and, most of all, fun&quot;. Daniels also produced albums for the Youngbloods, including their 1969 album &quot;Elephant Mountain&quot;.

===Solo career and formation of the Charlie Daniels Band===
Daniels released his self-titled debut album in 1970, which helped lay the foundations for Southern rock. Two years later, Daniels formed the Charlie Daniels Band. Daniels scored a Top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop charts with &quot;Uneasy Rider&quot;, a talking bluegrass song, in 1973. The following year, Daniels organized the first Volunteer Jam concert. The same year, the Charlie Daniels Band released the gold selling &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;, followed by the even more successful &quot;Nightrider&quot;, whose success was spurred by the Top 40 hit single &quot;Texas&quot;. &quot;Saddle Tramp&quot; was also a gold seller, and was the first release by the band to reach the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country charts.

In 1975 he played fiddle on Hank Williams Jr&#x27;s breakthrough studio album Hank Williams Jr. and Friends on the songs &quot;Losin You&quot; originally by The Marshall Tucker Band and &quot;Stoned At The Jukebox&quot;. He would also later provide a fiddle solo to the bridge of Williams Jr&#x27;s later song Family Tradition from his 1979 studio album of the same name. 
In 1979, the Charlie Daniels Band released their most commercially successful album, &quot;Million Mile Reflections&quot;, which reached number five and was certified triple-platinum. It featured the single &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, which reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in September 1979, and won Daniels the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance. The band also attracted a high-profile fan in President Jimmy Carter, who used Daniels&#x27; song &quot;The South&#x27;s Gonna Do It Again&quot; as his campaign theme, After Carter&#x27;s win, the band performed at his 1977 inauguration. In 1980, Daniels played himself in the film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, starring John Travolta, and as a result became closely identified with the revival of country music generated by the film&#x27;s success. Subsequently, the combination of the success of the more country-oriented song and the decline in popularity of Southern rock led Daniels to shift focus in his sound from rock to country music. After the platinum certified &quot;Full Moon&quot; (1980) and the gold certified &quot;Windows&quot; (1982), Daniels would not have another hit album until the 1989 release &quot;Simple Man&quot;, which earned Daniels another gold album, although the title track sparked controversy, as it was interpreted by some as advocating vigilantism, due to lyrics such as &quot;Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp/Put &#x27;em on their knees and tie &#x27;em to a stump/Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest&quot;, which garnered Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.

===Later career===
In the 1990s, Daniels&#x27; albums failed to chart, although he continued to draw audiences as a concert performer well into the 21st century. In 1995, Daniels released the first of three Christian albums for Sparrow Records, &quot;The Door&quot;. In 1999, Daniels was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.

The 21st century saw Daniels, who had previously recorded for major labels, predominantly recording for independent record labels. In 2001, Daniels received considerable attention for his song &quot;This Ain&#x27;t No Rag, It&#x27;s a Flag&quot;, released in November, 2001, which was written in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11th of that year. Daniels then followed with a book entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Rag&quot;. &quot;Songs from the Longleaf Pines&quot; (2005) marked Daniels&#x27; first fully bluegrass and gospel album, and began an association with Koch Records, who began releasing a series of Daniels&#x27; albums which included holiday albums, live albums and theme compilations. 

On October 18, 2005, Daniels was honored as a BMI Icon at the 53rd annual BMI Country Awards. The following year, Daniels played in the backup band for Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s opening sequence to &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. In November 2007, Daniels was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted during the January 19, 2008, edition of the Opry. In 2009, Daniels was featured playing fiddle in a commercial for GEICO.

In 2016, Daniels released &quot;Night Hawks&quot;, an album of Western swing music. In October of that year, Daniels became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. In March 2017, HarperCollins announced that Daniels&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Never Look at the Empty Seats&quot;, would be released on October 24, 2017. In the late 2010s, Daniels, drummer James Stroud, guitarist Billy Crain and bassist Charlie Hayward formed a new band, Beau Weevils, which debuted on the 2018 album &quot;Songs in the Key of E&quot;, which Daniels described as being in a &quot;down-home, swampy rock meets funk with a little taste of Delta-type of style.&quot; On September 28, 2018, Daniels was awarded the MMP Music Award and inducted into the MMP Global Entertainment Hall of Fame in Biloxi, MS. On November 6, 2018, Daniels released a book of daily inspirational quotes and stories titled &quot;Let&#x27;s All Make the Day Count: The Everyday Wisdom of Charlie Daniels&quot; through HarperCollins&#x27;s Thomas Nelson imprint.

==Musical style==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that Charlie Daniels&#x27; self-titled debut album, released in 1970, was a pivotal recording in the development of the Southern rock genre, &quot;because it points the way to how the genre could and would sound, and how country music could retain its hillbilly spirit and rock like a mother.&quot; Erlewine described Daniels as &quot;a redneck rebel, not fitting into either the country or the rock &amp; roll [...] but, in retrospect, he sounds like a visionary, pointing the way to the future when southern rockers saw no dividing lines between rock, country, and blues, and only saw it all as sons of the South.&quot; The Charlie Daniels Band fused rock, country, blues, and jazz; Erlewine described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;a distinctly Southern blend&quot; which emphasized improvisation in their instrumentation, which was aided by the band following the Allman Brothers Band’s seminal use of two lead guitarists and two drummers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Daniels&#x27; music incorporated elements of country, blues, bluegrass, rock and Western swing.

After the success of &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, a single which Erlewine described as a &quot;a roaring country-disco fusion&quot;, Daniels shifted his sound from rock toward country music. In both Daniels&#x27; rock and country recordings, Daniels &quot;helped shape the sound of country-rock&quot;. In 1977, &quot;Billboard&quot; identified the Charlie Daniels Band as major performers of progressive country. Rapper Cowboy Troy said that Charlie Daniels and Jerry Reed&#x27;s vocal delivery &quot;was called recitations at that time, but if you listened to it now, you&#x27;d probably call it a rap&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; as one of the earliest examples of country rap. Regarding his musical style, Daniels said &quot;I never claimed to be country&quot;; Daniels described his style instead as &quot;American music&quot;, saying that the Charlie Daniels Band played &quot;some of all the music that&#x27;s come across in America&quot;, particularly country, bluegrass, rock, gospel and jazz. Daniels also said &quot;I refuse to be categorized because I think that puts blinders on you.&quot; Daniels&#x27; guitar playing was defined as having a &quot;thick, buttery sound&quot; which he achieved by stringing his Les Paul guitars with .10 gauge Gibson strings, and amplifying them through a Marshall cabinet.

==Views==

Daniels did not endorse any political candidates, and refused to express political views in his concerts. Regarding his views, Daniels said, &quot;I do not consider myself political. I can understand why people would say what I write is political. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just my feelings. It&#x27;s common sense to me as an American citizen, which is not only our right, but our duty, really, to express our opinion, if no other way than at least in the voting booth. I don&#x27;t do that on stage. I don&#x27;t pay good money to go hear somebody talk about their political beliefs. It&#x27;s just not part of my show. That is confined to the private part of my life, which I consider my writings on Twitter and [interviews]&quot;. However, in 1976, Daniels performed at campaign fundraisers for Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidential bid, and at his inauguration in January the following year; Daniels also initially supported the legalization of marijuana. In the following decade, however, Daniels expressed views that many considered to be right-wing and conservative. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; writer Seth Cohen, Daniels &quot;frequently captured the pent-up frustrations of many Americans who felt that a &quot;coastal elite&quot; cadre of politicians and activists were moving the country farther away from some of its core values&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Daniels had &quot;plenty in common with moderates and liberals who supported Bernie Sanders, expressing disgust at Washington gridlock and a fervent belief in term limits for people in Congress so that fresh ideas keep coming.&quot; Daniels also supported &quot;the idea that someone can criticize the president&#x27;s decision making and not be called anti-American.&quot; 

Daniels was an outspoken Christian. In 2003, Daniels supported the invasion of Iraq. Regarding the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, Daniels said, &quot;If tearing them down did any good, I&#x27;d be all for it. But I don&#x27;t see where it does any good.&quot; Daniels also said that &quot;when we pay attention to political correctness and things that don&#x27;t really mean anything, we&#x27;re wasting time, energy and political capital by not getting something meaningful done. We spend time chasing rainbows.&quot; In 2013, following chemical weapons attacks by Bashar al-Assad, and United States military response, Daniels wrote, &quot;These and other questions need to be answered before any kind of action, bilateral or unilateral is taken. Otherwise, we will be right back in the same old Middle Eastern boiling pot again and I think everybody, doves and hawks alike, have had enough of that.&quot; In 2016, he appeared in an ad for the NRA that was directed at the government of Iran. After President Donald Trump&#x27;s April 7, 2017 military strike against targets in Syria in retaliation for additional chemical weapon deployment, Daniels tweeted: &quot;The world changed yesterday, America will no longer be viewed as a cowering toothless tiger.&quot; In 2019, Daniels lambasted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for signing the Reproductive Health Act, which legalized abortion until birth under some circumstances, tweeting &quot;Watch the wrinkles on Cuomo&#x27;s face lengthen as the ramifications of the thousands of murders he has sanctioned come to bear on him. The NY legislature has created a new Auschwitz dedicated to the execution of a whole segment of defenseless citizens. Satan is smiling.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Daniels married Hazel Juanita Alexander on September 20, 1964. They had one child, a son, Charles Edward Daniels Jr. An avid University of Tennessee sports fan, Daniels enjoyed hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and other outdoor activities. He was a member of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and performed on their videos.

Daniels suffered a major arm injury on January 30, 1980, while digging fence post holes on his farm near Mount Juliet. He suffered three complete breaks in his right arm and two broken fingers when his shirtsleeve caught on a spinning power auger. The injury required surgery and sidelined him for four months.

Daniels was successfully treated for prostate cancer in 2001. On January 15, 2010, Daniels was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke while snowmobiling in Colorado. He was released two days later. During a doctor visit on March 25, 2013, Daniels was diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia and admitted to a Nashville hospital for a series of routine tests. The tests revealed that a pacemaker was needed to regulate his heart rate. One was put in on March 28, and Daniels was released from the hospital within days.

Daniels died on July 6, 2020, at the age of 83 of a hemorrhagic stroke at Summit Medical Center in Hermitage, Tennessee. He was buried in a grave at Mount Juliet, Tennessee.

<doc id="429540" wikidata="Q1471867" url="?curid=429540" title="Turangalîla-Symphonie">
<text>The Turangalîla-Symphonie is the only symphony by Olivier Messiaen (1908–1992). It was written for an orchestra of large forces from 1946 to 1948 on a commission by Serge Koussevitzky for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Along with the &quot;Quatuor pour la fin du temps&quot;, the symphony is one of the composer&#x27;s most notable works.

Leonard Bernstein conducted the premiere in Boston on 2 December 1949, followed by the New York premiere on 10 December. The December 1949 performances included an intermission after the fifth movement; it was the only work on the program. The commission did not specify the duration, orchestral requirements or style of the piece, leaving the decisions to the composer. Koussevitzky was scheduled to conduct the premiere, but fell ill, and the task fell to Bernstein, who never conducted the work again. Yvonne Loriod, who later became Messiaen&#x27;s second wife, was the piano soloist, and Ginette Martenot played the ondes Martenot for the first and several subsequent performances.

From 1953 on, Yvonne&#x27;s sister Jeanne Loriod was the ondes Martenot player in many performances and recordings.

==Concept==

While most of Messiaen&#x27;s compositions are religious in inspiration, at the time of writing the symphony the composer was fascinated by the myth of Tristan and Isolde, and the Turangalîla Symphony forms the central work in his trilogy of compositions concerned with the themes of romantic love and death; the other pieces are &quot;Harawi&quot; for piano with soprano and &quot;Cinq rechants&quot; for unaccompanied trios of soprani, alti, tenors, and basses. It is considered one of the greatest musical compositions of the 20th century; being described by its commissioner as &#x27;the most important piece of classical music ever written since Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;&#x27;. A typical performance runs around 80 minutes in length. Messiaen famously summarised the entire symphony as being &quot;a love song; a hymn to joy.&quot;

Although the concept of a rhythmic scale corresponding to the chromatic scale of pitches occurs in Messiaen&#x27;s work as early as 1944, in the &quot;Vingt regards sur l&#x27;enfant-Jésus&quot; (a work Messiaen quotes in the fourth movement), the arrangement of such durations into a fixed series occurs for the first time in the opening episode of the movement &quot;Turangalîla 2&quot; in this work, and is an important historical step toward the concept of integral serialism.

The title of the work, and those of its movements, were a late addition to the project, chosen after Messiaen made a list of the work&#x27;s movements. He described the name in his letters from 1947 to 1948. He derived the title from two Sanskrit words, () and  (), which he explained thus:
:&quot;Lîla&quot; literally means play – but play in the sense of the divine action upon the cosmos, the play of creation, destruction, reconstruction, the play of life and death. &quot;Lila&quot; is also love. &quot;Turanga&quot;: this is the time that runs, like a galloping horse; this is time that flows, like sand in an hourglass. &quot;Turanga&quot; is movement and rhythm. &quot;Turangalîla&quot; therefore means all at once love song, hymn to joy, time, movement, rhythm, life and death.

Messiaen described the joy of Turangalîla as &quot;superhuman, overflowing, blinding, unlimited&quot;. He revised the work&#x27;s orchestration in 1990.

==Instrumentation==

The piece is scored for a large orchestra with a particularly large percussion section:

:Solo piano
:Ondes Martenot
Woodwinds
: 1 piccolo
: 2 flutes
: 2 oboes
: 1 cor anglais
: 2 clarinets
: 1 bass clarinet
: 3 bassoons
Brass
: 4 horns
: 3 trumpets
: 1 trumpet in D
: 1 cornet
: 3 trombones
: 1 tuba
Percussion (12 percussionists)

: Vibraphone
: Keyed or mallet glockenspiels
: Triangle
: Temple blocks
: Wood block
: Cymbals (crash and three types of suspended)
: Tam tam
: Tambourine
: Maracas
: Snare drum
: Provençal tabor
: Bass drum
: Tubular bells
: Celesta

Strings
: 32 violins
: 14 violas
: 12 cellos
: 10 double basses

The demanding piano part includes several solo cadenzas.

==Cyclic themes==

In writing about the work, Messiaen identified four cyclic themes that reappear throughout; there are other themes specific to each movement. In the score the themes are numbered, but in later writings he gave them names to make them easier to identify, without intending the names to have any other, literary meaning.


==Structure==
The work is in ten movements, linked by the common themes identified above, and other musical ideas:


The composer&#x27;s initial plan was for a symphony in the conventional four movements, which eventually became numbers 1, 4, 6, and 10. Next, he added the three &quot;Turangalîla&quot; movements, which he originally called &quot;tâlas&quot;, a reference to the use of rhythm in Indian classical music. Finally, the 2nd, 5th, and 8th movements were inserted. Early on, Messiaen authorized separate performance of movements 3, 4, and 5, as &quot;Three tâlas&quot; (not to be confused with the original use of the term for the three Turangalîla movements), but later came to disapprove of the performance of extracts.

==Recordings==

No recording was made of the world premiere, and Bernstein himself did not return to the work in either concert performance or in the recording studio, but a recording exists of part of the rehearsals for the premiere in Boston, featuring the fifth and sixth movements. 

It was released in 2013 as part of a set of previously unissued Bernstein recordings (Music and Arts WHRA-6048).
