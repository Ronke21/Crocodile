<doc id="441816" wikidata="Q150910" url="?curid=441816" title="Charles Algernon Parsons">
<text>Sir Charles Algernon Parsons (13 June 1854 – 11 February 1931) was an Anglo-Irish mechanical engineer and inventor who designed the modern steam turbine in 1884. His invention revolutionised marine propulsion, and he was also the founder of C. A. Parsons and Company. He worked as an engineer on dynamo and turbine design, and power generation, with great influence in the naval and electrical engineering fields. He also helped develop optical equipment for searchlights and telescopes. Parsons received the Faraday Medal and the Copley Medal for his work.

== Career and commercial activity ==

Parsons was born into an Anglo-Irish family on 13 June 1854 in London as the youngest son of the famous astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse. The family seat is Birr Castle, County Offaly, Ireland, and the town of Birr was called Parsonstown, after the family, from 1620 to 1901. 

With his three brothers, Parsons was educated at home in Ireland by private tutors (including John Purser), all of whom were well versed in the sciences and also acted as practical assistants to the Earl in his astronomical work. (One of them later became, as Sir Robert Ball, Royal Astronomer of Ireland.) Parsons then read mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin and at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating from the latter in 1877 with a first-class honours degree. He joined the Newcastle-based engineering firm of W.G. Armstrong as an apprentice, an unusual step for the son of an earl. Later he moved to Kitsons in Leeds, where he worked on rocket-powered torpedoes.

=== Steam turbine engine ===


In 1884 Parsons moved to Clarke, Chapman and Co., ship-engine manufacturers operating near Newcastle, where he became head of their electrical-equipment development. He used Regnault&#x27;s large collection of steam properties (&quot;data of the physicists&quot;) to develop a turbine engine turning at 18,000 RPM in 1884 and immediately utilised the new engine to drive an electrical generator, which he also designed. Parsons&#x27; steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionised marine transport and naval warfare.

Another type of steam turbine at the time, invented by Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913) in the 1880s, was an impulse design that subjected the mechanism to huge centrifugal forces and so had limited output due to the weakness of the materials available. Parsons explained in his 1911 Rede Lecture that his appreciation of the scaling issue led to his 1884 breakthrough on the compound steam turbine:

It seemed to me that moderate surface velocities and speeds of rotation were essential if the turbine motor was to receive general acceptance as a prime mover. I therefore decided to split up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series, so that the velocity of the steam nowhere should be great...I was also anxious to avoid the well-known cutting action on metal of steam at high velocity.

=== Founding Parsons and Company ===

In 1889 he founded C. A. Parsons and Company in Newcastle to produce turbo generators to his design. In the same year he set up the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCO). In 1890, DisCo opened Forth Banks Power Station, the first power station in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators. In 1894 he regained certain patent rights from Clarke Chapman. Although his first turbine was only 1.6% efficient and generated a mere 7.5 kilowatts, rapid incremental improvements in a few years led to his first megawatt turbine, built in 1899 for a generating plant at Elberfeld in the German Empire.


=== Marine steam turbine applications ===

Also interested in marine applications, Parsons founded the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company in Newcastle. Famously, in June 1897, his turbine-powered yacht, &quot;Turbinia&quot;, turned up unannounced at the Navy Review for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Spithead, on 26 June 1897, in front of the Prince of Wales, foreign dignitaries, and Lords of the Admiralty. Moving at speed at Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review off Portsmouth, to demonstrate the great potential of the new technology. The &quot;Turbinia&quot; moved at ; the fastest Royal Navy ships using other technologies reached . Part of the speed improvement came from the slender hull of the &quot;Turbinia&quot;.

Within two years the destroyers HMS &quot;Viper&quot; and were launched with Parsons&#x27; turbines, soon followed by the first turbine-powered passenger ship, Clyde steamer TS &quot;King Edward&quot; in 1901; the first turbine transatlantic liners RMS &quot;Victorian&quot; and &quot;Virginian&quot; in 1905; and the first turbine-powered battleship, in 1906, all of them driven by Parsons&#x27; turbine engines. ( &quot;Turbinia&quot; is housed in a purpose-built gallery at the Discovery Museum, Newcastle.)

=== Honours and awards ===

Parsons was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1898, received their Rumford Medal in 1902 and their Copley Medal in 1928, and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1918. He served as the president of the British Association from 1916 to 1919. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 at Toronto. Knighted in 1911, he became a member of the Order of Merit in 1927. In 1929 the Iron and Steel Institute awarded him the Bessemer Gold Medal.

=== Surviving companies ===

The Parsons turbine company survives in the Heaton area of Newcastle as part of Siemens, a German conglomerate. In 1925 Charles Parsons acquired the &quot;Grubb Telescope Company&quot; and renamed it &quot;Grubb Parsons&quot;. That company survived in the Newcastle area until 1985.

Parsons also designed the Auxetophone, an early compressed-air gramophone.

== Personal life and death ==

In 1883, Parsons married Katharine Bethell, the daughter of William F. Bethell. They had two children: the engineer and campaigner Rachel Mary Parsons (b. 1885), and Algernon George &quot;Tommy&quot; Parsons (b. 1886), who was killed in action during World War I in 1918, aged 31.

They had a London home at 1 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, from 1918 to 1931.

Sir Charles Algernon Parsons died on 11 February 1931, on board the steamship &quot;Duchess of Richmond&quot; while on a cruise with his wife. The cause of death was given as neuritis. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 3 March 1931. Parsons was buried in the parish church of St Bartholomew&#x27;s in Kirkwhelpington in Northumberland.

His widow, Katharine, died at her home in Ray Demesne, Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland in 1933. Rachel Parsons died in 1956; stableman Denis James Pratt was convicted of her manslaughter.

In 1919, Katharine and her daughter Rachel co-founded the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society with Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, Margaret, Lady Moir, Laura Annie Willson, Margaret Rowbotham and Janetta Mary Ornsby, which is still in existence today. Sir Charles was initially a supportive member of the organisation until his wife&#x27;s resignation.

==Commemoration==
Parsons&#x27; ancestral home at Birr Castle in Ireland houses a museum detailing the contribution the Parsons family have made to the fields of science and engineering, with part of the museum given over to the engineering work of Charles Parsons.

Parsons is depicted on the reverse of an Irish silver 15 Euros silver Proof coin that was struck in 2017.

The Irish Academy of Engineering awards The Parsons Medal, named after Charles Parsons, every year to an engineer who has made an exceptional contribution to the practice of engineering. Previous winners include Prof. Tony Fagan (2016), Dr. Edmond Harty (2017), Prof. Sir John McCanny (2018) and Michael McLaughlin (2019).

<text>Psilocybe ( ) is a genus of gilled mushrooms, growing worldwide, in the family Hymenogastraceae. Many species contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Taxonomic history ===
A 2002 study of the molecular phylogeny of the agarics indicated that the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot; as then defined was polyphyletic, falling into two distinct clades that are not directly related to each other. The blue-staining hallucinogenic species constituted one clade and the non-bluing species the other. The previous type species of the genus, &quot;Psilocybe &quot; (now &quot;Deconica montana&quot;), was in the non-bluing clade, but in 2010 the type species was changed to &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, a member of the bluing clade. A 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of the Agaricales by Matheny and colleagues, further demonstrated the separation of the bluing and non-bluing clades of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; in a larger, strongly supported phylogenetic tree of the Agaricales.

&quot;Psilocybe&quot; had been placed taxonomically in the agaric family Strophariaceae based upon its spore and pileipellis morphology. The phylogenetic study by Matheny &quot;et al.&quot;, placed the non-bluing &quot;Psilocybe&quot; and its close relatives in a basal position within the Strophariaceae, a sister taxon to a clade containing the other genera within that family. The bluing &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, however, form a clade that is sister to &quot;Galerina&quot; in the newly revised family, Hymenogastraceae that used to be restricted to secotioid, false-truffles. The phylogenetic study by Moncalvo, &quot;et al.&quot; confirmed that the agaric genus &quot;Melanotus&quot; is simply a subgroup of the non-bluing &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, all of which are placed in &quot;Deconica&quot;, and also pointed to a close relationship between the latter genus and the genera &quot;Kuehneromyces&quot; and &quot;Phaeogalera&quot;.

=== Modern classification ===
In 2007, a paper by Redhead &quot;et al.&quot; proposed conserving the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot; with &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; as its type species. The suggestion was accepted by unanimous vote of the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi of the International Botanical Congress in 2010, meaning that &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; (a member of the bluing clade) now serves as the type species of the genus. Since &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; is now the type species of the genus, the bluing hallucinogenic clade remained in the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot; (Hymenogastraceae) while the non-bluing clade were transferred to the genus &quot;Deconica&quot; (Strophariaceae). However, it has been demonstrated that &quot;P. fuscofulva&quot;, a species that used to be known as &quot;P. atrobrunnea&quot;, belongs to the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot; s.s. but does not contain psychotropic compounds. Negative results have also been published for &quot;P. fimetaria&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name &quot;Psilocybe&quot; is a compound of the Greek elements ψιλός (&quot;psilós&quot;) &quot;bare&quot; / &quot;naked&quot; and κύβη (&quot;kúbe&quot;) &quot;head&quot; / &quot;swelling&quot;, giving the meaning &quot;bare-headed&quot; (i.e. bald) referring to the mushroom&#x27;s detachable pellicle (loose skin over the cap), which can resemble a bald pate.

==Description==
&quot;Psilocybe&quot; fruit bodies are typically small, nondescript mushrooms with a typical &quot;little brown mushroom&quot; morphology. Macroscopically, they are characterized by their small to occasionally medium size, brown to yellow-brown coloration, with a typically hygrophanous cap, and a spore print-color that ranges from lilac-brown to dark purple-brown (though rusty-brown colored varieties are known in at least one species). Hallucinogenic species typically have a blue-staining reaction when the fruit body is bruised. Microscopically, they are characterized by pileipellis with hyphae that run parallel to the pileus surface, forming a &quot;cutis&quot;, by their lack of chrysocystidia, and by spores that are smooth, ellipsoid to rhomboid to subhexagonal in shape, with a distinct apical germ pore. Ecologically, all species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; are saprotrophs, growing on various kinds of decaying organic matter.

==Distribution and habitat==

Geographically, species in this genus are found throughout the world in most biomes. The greatest species diversity seems to be in the neotropics, from Mesoamerica through Brazil and Chile. &quot;Psilocybe&quot; are found in a variety of habitats and substrates. Many of the species found in temperate regions, such as &quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot;, seem to have an affinity for landscaped areas mulched with woodchips and are actually rather rare in natural settings removed from human habitation. Contrary to popular belief, only a minority of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species, such as &quot;P. cubensis&quot; and &quot;P. subcubensis&quot;, grow directly on feces. Many other species are found in habitats such as mossy, grassy, or forest humus soils. &quot;Psilocybe&quot; arose about 65 million years ago.

==Psychoactivity==

===Biochemistry and pharmacology===

The psilocybin molecule is indirectly responsible for the hallucinogenic properties of the &quot;Psilocybe&quot;. This compound, as well as all other indole alkaloids, are derived from the amino acid tryptophan, being the only amino acid with the indole-amine ring. Tryptophan is converted to tryptamine by decarboxylation. Two methylation steps occur producing DMT, another psychedelic compound. Hydroxylation of this compound produces the more potent hallucinogen psilocin, followed by phosphorylation yielding psilocybin. After ingestion of the psilocybin compound alkaline phosphatases present in the body&#x27;s digestive system, kidneys, and possibly in the blood readily cleave the phosphoryl ester bond from psilocybin, yielding the hydroxyl compound, psilocin. Psilocin is the chemical primarily responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of the &quot;Psilocybe&quot;. The blue-staining species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; are characterized by the presence of psilocin and psilocybin. This blue-staining reaction occurs after the fruit body has been injured, particularly near the base of the stalk. This reaction is thought to be due to the oxidation of psilocybin after the outer surface of the fruit body has been breached. The degree of bluing in a &quot;Psilocybe&quot; fruit body roughly correlates with the concentration of psilocin in the mushroom. Psilocybin is chemically far more stable than psilocin, the latter compound being largely lost when the mushroom is heated or dried.

The chemical structure of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is similar to that of psilocin. The latter differs mainly by the location of one of the hydroxyls, and the addition of two methyl groups that make the molecule lipophilic (fat soluble), ergo capable of crossing the lipid membrane sheaths of the central nervous system. After psilocybin has been ingested and dephosphorylated, to psilocin, the mechanism it uses in the brain has a direct agonist effect on the 5-HT serotonin receptors. To explain this effect, the psilocin molecule essentially mimics the serotonin molecule, binding to the 5-HT receptors and initiating the same response as the serotonin. This effect explains the euphoria experienced by ingestion of this &quot;agonist.&quot; Initially, hallucinogens were thought to blockade these serotonin neurotransmitters, but persistent research led to this agonist effect conclusion.

Woolley and Campbell conducted research to determine whether the depletion of the hormone serotonin had a direct effect on mental disorders and that hallucinations might be due to an excess of serotonin. Their results led them to study chemicals analogous to serotonin. They found that the psychoactive chemicals psilocybin and psilocin exhibited serotonin-like effects, however as dosage increased, these compounds acted as serotonin antagonists, psilocybin being comparable to the most potent antagonist yet discovered. This is a plausible basis for the psychological effects of these hallucinogenic compounds.

Even though these chemicals are psychoactive and therefore the basidiomycete deemed toxic, there have been no reports of fatalities or induced internal organ damage directly associated with ingestion of these chemicals. Misidentification of the fruit body could lead to ingestion of a lethal fungus.

Some psychoactive species contain baeocystin, norbaeocystin and β‐carboline monoamine oxidase inhibitors in addition to psilocin and psilocybin.

===Medical and psychiatric aspects===
The medicinal uses of the &quot;Psilocybe&quot; was recorded by Native Americans of Central America. Shamans, or curanderas would avidly ingest the &quot;sacred mushrooms&quot; for the extrasensory perceptual effects it gave them in order to better assess problems faced in their society. The observed effects of the alkaloids found in these mushrooms has given rise to research into their possible uses for psychiatric medicine.

==History and ethnography==

Hallucinogenic species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; have a long history of use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times up to the present day. Hallucinogenic &quot;Psilocybe&quot; were known to the aboriginal Mexicans as &quot;teonanácatl&quot; (literally &quot;divine mushroom&quot;) and were reportedly served at the coronation of Moctezuma II in 1502. After the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, like other pre-Christian traditions, was forcibly suppressed and driven underground.

By the 20th century, hallucinogenic mushroom use was thought by non-Native Americans to have disappeared entirely. However, in 1955, Valentina Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson became the first Westerners to actively participate in an indigenous mushroom ceremony. The Wassons did much to publicize their discovery, even publishing an article on their experiences in &quot;Life&quot; in 1957. In 1956, Roger Heim identified the hallucinogenic mushroom that the Wassons had brought back from Mexico as &quot;Psilocybe&quot; and in 1958, Albert Hofmann first reported psilocin and psilocybin as the active compound in these mushrooms. There is some skepticism as to whether or not these &quot;sacred mushrooms&quot; were actually in the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot;. However, according to Heim&#x27;s research in Mexico, he identified three species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; that he believed were used in these native ceremonies. The species identified by Heim were; &quot;P. mexicana, P. caerulescens&quot;, and &quot;P. zapotecorum&quot;. are a variety of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; mushrooms that make up the &quot;teonanácatl&quot; group of hallucinogenic mushrooms, including &quot;P. cubensis&quot;. Isauro Nava Garcia, a Mazatec man, provided guidance to Heim while Heim conducted his field and culture work. Garcia was an avid observer of the fungi in his environment while identifying specific characteristics about the fruit body of the &quot;Psilocybe&quot; his ancestors utilized, as well as knowing where they could be found.

At present, hallucinogenic mushroom use has been reported among a number of groups spanning from central Mexico to Oaxaca, including groups of Nahua, Mixtecs, Mixe, Mazatecs, Zapotecs, and others.

The popularization of entheogens by Wasson, Timothy Leary, and others has led to an explosion in the use of hallucinogenic &quot;Psilocybe&quot; throughout the world. By the early 1970s, a number of psychoactive &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species were described from temperate North America, Europe, and Asia and were widely collected. Books describing methods of cultivating &quot;P. cubensis&quot; in large quantities were also published. The relatively easy availability of hallucinogenic &quot;Psilocybe&quot; from wild and cultivated sources has made it among the most widely used of the hallucinogenic drugs.

==Legal status==

The purified chemicals psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule&quot; &quot;II drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. However, the UN drug treaties do not apply to cultivation, preparation, or international transport of psilocybin mushrooms.

Internationally, the two chemicals are generally considered controlled substances. However, there is much ambiguity about what is considered a &quot;container&quot; of these compounds. In several countries (e.g. Brazil), the chemicals themselves are listed as controlled substances, but the mushrooms that contain the chemicals are not, therefore deemed legal.
In the United States, possession of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; mushroom fruiting bodies is illegal in every state except for Florida. This is because the Supreme Court of Florida does not believe that these mushrooms could &quot;reasonably be found to be containers of the schedule I substance, psilocybin&quot;.

In the United States there is no federal law mentioning the possession of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; spores, this is because only the psilocybin and psilocin compounds are considered Schedule I drugs and there is no presence of these compounds in the spores themselves, only in the fruiting body of the cultivated spores. However, there are several US states that have actually prohibited possession of these spores because they can be cultivated to produce these hallucinogenic, Schedule&quot; &quot;I drugs. These states includes California, Georgia, and Idaho.

However, possession of the spores by a qualified mycologist in California is legal if being put to use for research purposes, which must be approved by Research Advisory Panel. If not authorized by law, possession of spores or cultivation of fruiting bodies of the &quot;Psilocybe&quot; is punishable to not more than one year in county jail or state prison.

Psilocybin mushrooms as well as other &quot;soft drugs&quot; which are stronger than cannabis but not synthetic, are legally available through smart shops in the Netherlands. Only the truffle form of magic mushrooms (such as &quot;P. tampanensis&quot;) are currently legal, but these still contain the active ingredients and produce similar effect as the caps and stalks.

==Notable species==

* &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; (&quot;Stropharia cubensis&quot;); the most commonly cultivated and consumed &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, due to ease of cultivation and large size of fruit bodies; also commonly collected throughout the tropics and subtropics, nicknamed the commercial psilocybe.
* &quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot;; Native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, but also found in western Europe; nicknamed the &quot;wavy-cap&quot; or &quot;wavies&quot;.
* &quot;Psilocybe natalensis;&quot; is found in South Africa and closely related to Psilocybe cubensis.
* &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot;; The most common psilocybin-containing mushroom. Found in northern temperate climates; nicknamed the &quot;liberty cap&quot;.
* &quot;Psilocybe azurescens&quot;, a highly potent species native to the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon, but popular in outdoor cultivation, and expanding its range as a result; nicknamed &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis is a bi-lingual Greek and Latin manuscript of the New Testament written in an uncial hand on parchment. It is designated by the siglum D or 05 in the Gregory-Aland numbering of New Testament manuscripts, and δ 5 in the von Soden numbering of New Testament manuscripts. It contains most of the four Gospels and Acts, with a small fragment of 3 John. Using the study of comparative writing styles (palaeography), it is currently dated to the 5th century.

Codex Bezae is renowned for having a distinctive text of the four Gospels and Acts, and is a leading member of the &quot;Western&quot; recension. The manuscript has been studied extensively.
A digital facsimile of the codex is available from Cambridge University Library, which holds the manuscript.

== Description ==
The manuscript is a codex (the precursor to the modern book), containing the text of the four Gospels, Acts and 3 John written on 406 extant parchment leaves, from perhaps an original 534 (sized 26 x 21.5 cm). The text is written in one column per page, with the Greek text on the left face and the Latin text on the right. The text is written colometrically and is full of hiatus. The first three lines of each book are in red letters, with black and red ink alternating the title of books. As many as eleven correctors (designated as G, A, C, B, D, E, H, F, J, L, K) have amended the text of the manuscript between the sixth and twelfth centuries. The Greek text of the codex has some copying errors, e.g., errors of metathesis (the transposition of sounds or syllables in a word), such as seen in , where (&quot;egeneto&quot;) was changed into (&quot;enegeto&quot;); and in , where (&quot;hypelaben&quot;) transforms into (&quot;hypebalen&quot;).

The manuscript employs the following nomina sacra (sacred names/words considered sacred in Christianity); the ones cited here are only nominative case (subject case) examples: ( / &quot;Iēsous&quot; / &quot;Jesus&quot;), ( / &quot;Christos&quot; / &quot;Christ&quot;), ( / &quot;patēr&quot; / &quot;Father&quot;), ( / &quot;staurōthē&quot; / &quot;[he] was crucified&quot;). Other words which usually feature among the nomina sacra are written out in full: (&quot;mēter&quot; / &quot;Mother&quot;), υιος (&quot;huios&quot; / &quot;Son&quot;), σωτηρ (&quot;sōter&quot; / &quot;savior&quot;), ανθρωπος (&quot;anthrōpos&quot; / &quot;man&quot;), ουρανος (&quot;ouranos&quot; / &quot;sky&quot;), Δαυιδ (&quot;David&quot;), Ισραηλ (&quot;Israel&quot;), and (&quot;Iērousalēm&quot; &#x27;Jerusalem&#x27;).

== Codex contents ==
The manuscript presents the gospels in the so-called Western order of Matthew, John, Luke and Mark, of which only Luke is complete; after some missing pages the manuscript picks up with the Third Epistle of John (in Latin) and contains part of Acts.

; Missing sections:
: Matthew 1:1–20, 6:20–9:2, 27:2–12; John 1:16–3:26; Acts 8:29–10:14, 21:2–10, 21:16–18, 22:10–20, 22:29–end

; Omitted verses:
: Matthew ; ; ; ; ; ; 
: Mark 
: Luke ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; 
: John 

; Supplementations (by a later hand):
: Matthew 3:7–16; Mark 16:15–20; John 18:14–20:13

== Text type ==
The Greek text is unique, with many interpolations found in no other manuscript. It has several remarkable omissions, and a capricious tendency to rephrase sentences. Aside from this one Greek manuscript, the type of text is found in Old Latin (pre-Vulgate) versions — as seen in the Latin here — and in Syriac, and Armenian versions. &quot;Bezae&quot; is the principal Greek representative of the Western text-type.

There is no consensus on the many problems the Greek text presents. Since the Latin text occasionally agrees with Codices Bobiensis and Vercellensis against all others, it &quot;preserves an ancient form of the Old Latin&quot;, and is a witness to a text which was current no later than 250 CE. Issues of conformity have dogged the usage of the codex in biblical scholarship. &quot;In general the Greek text is treated as an unreliable witness,&quot; but it is &quot;an important corroborating witness wherever it agrees with other early manuscripts.&quot;

Some of the outstanding features: Matthew 16:2b–3 is present and not marked as doubtful or spurious. One of the longer endings of Mark is given. Luke 22:43f and Pericope Adulterae are present and not marked as spurious or doubtful. John 5:4 is omitted, and the text of Acts is nearly 8% longer than the generally received text. It also includes a story of a man working on the Sabbath placed after Luke 6:4 which is not found in any other manuscript.

Acts in Codex Bezae differs quite considerably from other manuscripts, which some argue possibly represents an earlier version directly from Luke.

== Notable readings ==

Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis contains some extraordinary readings. Below is a selection of some of the more notable or unsupported readings, with text and translation.





== History ==
The codex&#x27;s place of origin is still disputed; both Gaul (France) and southern Italy have been suggested. Other proposed places of origin include Egypt, Palestine and Beirut.

The manuscript is believed to have been repaired at Lyon (France) in the ninth century, as revealed by a distinctive ink used for supplementary pages. It was closely guarded for many centuries in the monastic library of St Irenaeus at Lyon. The manuscript was consulted, perhaps in Italy, for disputed readings at the Council of Trent, and was at about the same time collated for Stephanus&#x27;s edition of the Greek New Testament. During the upheavals of the Wars of Religion in the 16th century, when textual analysis had a new urgency among the Reformation&#x27;s Protestants, the manuscript was stolen from the monastic library in Lyon when French Huguenots ransacked the library in 1562. It was delivered to the Protestant scholar Theodore Beza, the friend and successor of Calvin, who gave it in 1581 to the University of Cambridge, in the comparative security of England, which accounts for its double name. It remains in the Cambridge University Library (Nn. II 41).

Scholar John Mill collated and biblical scholar Johann Jakob Wettstein transcribed (in 1716) the text of the codex. Both did their editions of the Greek Testament, but both did their work carelessly. A much better collation was made about 1732 by John Dickinson.

In 1787, the University of Cambridge appointed Dr Thomas Kipling to edit a facsimile edition which appeared in two volumes in 1793.

The English cleric Frederick H. A. Scrivener edited the text of the codex in 1864 (rewritten text of the codex) and published a photographic facsimile in 1899.

The importance of the manuscript is such that a colloquium held at Lunel, Hérault, in the south of France on 27–30 June 1994 was entirely devoted to it. Papers discussed the many questions it poses to our understanding of the use of the Gospels and Acts in early Christianity, and of the text of the New Testament.

<doc id="441835" wikidata="Q547344" url="?curid=441835" title="Animal Liberation (book)">
<text>Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals is a 1975 book by the Australian philosopher Peter Singer. It is widely considered within the animal liberation movement to be the founding philosophical statement of its ideas. Singer himself rejected the use of the theoretical framework of rights when it comes to human and nonhuman animals. Following Jeremy Bentham, Singer argued that the interests of animals should be considered because of their ability to experience suffering and that the idea of rights was not necessary in order to consider them. He popularized the term &quot;speciesism&quot; in the book, which had been coined by Richard D. Ryder to describe the exploitative treatment of animals.

A revised edition, &quot;Animal Liberation Now&quot;, was released in 2023.

==Summary==
Singer allows that animal rights are not the same as human rights, writing in &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; that &quot;there are obviously important differences between humans and other animals, and these differences must give rise to some differences in the rights that each have.&quot;

In &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, Singer argues against what he calls speciesism: discrimination on the grounds that a being belongs to a certain species. He holds the interests of all beings capable of suffering to be worthy of equal consideration and that giving lesser consideration to beings based on their species is no more justified than discrimination based on skin color. He argues that animals&#x27; rights should be based on their capacity to feel pain more than on their intelligence. In particular, he argues that while animals show lower intelligence than the average human, many severely intellectually challenged humans show equally diminished, if not lower, mental capacity and that some animals have displayed signs of intelligence (for example, primates learning elements of American sign language and other symbolic languages) sometimes on a par with that of human children. Therefore, intelligence does not provide a basis for giving nonhuman animals any less consideration than such intellectually challenged humans. Singer concludes that the most practical solution is to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet. He also condemns vivisection except where the benefit (in terms of improved medical treatment, etc.) outweighs the harm done to the animals used.

==Reception==
Activist Ingrid Newkirk wrote of &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, &quot;It forever changed the conversation about our treatment of animals. It made people—myself included—change what we ate, what we wore, and how we perceived animals.&quot; Other activists who claim that their attitudes to animals changed after reading the book include Peter Tatchell and Matt Ball.

Singer has expressed regret that the book did not have more impact. In September 1999, he was quoted by Michael Specter in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on the book&#x27;s impact:
:It&#x27;s had effects around the margins, of course, but they have mostly been minor. When I wrote it, I really thought the book would change the world. I know it sounds a little grand now, but at the time the sixties still existed for us. It looked as if real changes were possible, and I let myself believe that this would be one of them. All you have to do is walk around the corner to McDonald&#x27;s to see how successful I have been.

The book has also received a wide range of philosophical challenges to his formulation of animal rights. In a lengthy debate in &quot;Slate&quot;, published in 2001, Richard Posner wrote, among other things, that Singer failed to see the &quot;radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [his] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly intellectually challenged child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees.&quot; Singer replied to and rejected this claim, engaging in a lengthy debate with Posner.

In addition, Martha Nussbaum has argued that the capability approach provides a more adequate foundation of justice than Utilitarianism can supply. Utilitarianism, Nussbaum argues, ignores adaptive preferences, elides the separateness of distinct persons, misidentifies valuable human/non-human emotions such as grief, and calculates according to &quot;sum-rankings&quot; rather than inviolable protection of intrinsic entitlements.

The moral philosopher Roger Scruton criticised Singer&#x27;s works, including &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, saying that they &quot;contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals.&quot;

==Personal background==
In an essay entitled &quot;Animal Liberation: A Personal View&quot;, Singer describes the personal background that led to his adoption of the views he sets out in &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;. He writes of how he arrived in Oxford in October 1969, and in 1970 had lunch with a fellow graduate student, Richard Keshen, who avoided meat. This led Singer to inquire as to why and then to read Ruth Harrison&#x27;s book, &quot;Animal Machines&quot;, as well as a paper by Roslind Godlovitch (who would later co-edit &quot;Animals, Men and Morals&quot;), which convinced him to become a vegetarian and to take animal suffering seriously as a philosophical issue.

==&quot;Animal Liberation Now&quot;==
A revised edition, titled &quot;Animal Liberation Now: The Definitive Classic Renewed&quot;, was released on 23 May 2023, featuring a new foreword by Yuval Noah Harari. Two-thirds of the book consists of entirely new material, and it also documents changes in animal welfare since the book&#x27;s original publication, along with other developments, such as the impact of meat consumption on climate and on the risk of spreading dangerous new viruses.

<doc id="441838" wikidata="Q838776" url="?curid=441838" title="Bridge to Terabithia (novel)">
<text>Bridge to Terabithia is a children&#x27;s novel written by Katherine Paterson. The book was originally published in 1977 by Thomas Crowell, and would win a Newbery Medal the year after.

The novel tells the story of fifth grader Jesse Aarons, who becomes friends with his new neighbor, Leslie Burke, after he loses a footrace to her at school. Leslie is a tomboy from a wealthy family, and Jesse thinks highly of her. Jesse is an artistic boy from a poorer family who, in the beginning, is fearful and angry. After meeting Leslie, however, his life is transformed. He becomes courageous and learns to let go of his frustration. The two children create a kingdom for themselves, which Leslie names &quot;Terabithia&quot;.

Paterson drew inspiration for the novel from a real event that occurred in August 1974 when her son&#x27;s friend was struck and killed by lightning. The novel&#x27;s content has been the frequent target of censorship and appears at number eight on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books for the decade 1990–2000.

It has been adapted for the screen twice: a 1985 PBS TV movie and a 2007 Disney/Walden Media feature film.

==Background of book==

Katherine Paterson lived for a time in Takoma Park, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The novel was inspired by an incident during that time: on August 14, 1974, her son David&#x27;s best friend, Lisa Christina Hill, died after being struck by lightning in Bethany Beach, Delaware. She was eight years old.

The name of the imaginary kingdom is similar to that of the Narnian island Terebinthia, created by C. S. Lewis in 1951 or earlier for &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. Paterson observed in 2005:

I thought I had made it up. Then, rereading &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; by C. S. Lewis, I realized that I had probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis probably got that name from the terebinth tree in the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously.

The novel makes a direct reference to &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; as a series of books Leslie lends to Jess, in order to help him learn to behave like a king.

The novel also indirectly alludes to the fantasy series &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Ten-year-old Jesse &quot;Jess&quot; Aarons has trained all summer to be the fastest runner in his rural school. Secretly, he wants to be an artist, but his father disapproves. He has a crush on the school music teacher, Miss Edmunds, the only person who encourages him to draw.

Jess&#x27;s new neighbor, Leslie Burke, is a tomboy with a wealthy family from Arlington, Virginia. At recess on the first day of school, Leslie outruns everyone. The other students mock her for being a teacher&#x27;s pet and for not owning a television. When Jess defends Leslie from Janice Avery, an eighth grade bully, they become friends. They play by a dry creek behind Leslie&#x27;s house. They pretend they are the king and queen of a hidden magical kingdom, Terabithia, that can be entered only by swinging over the creek bed on an old rope.

When Jess&#x27;s six-year-old sister May Belle brings Twinkies to school for lunch, Janice Avery steals them. At Terabithia, Jess and Leslie forge a love letter to Janice from a boy she likes. The letter asks for a date, and Janice is humiliated when he does not show up. Months later, Leslie hears Janice crying in the bathroom. Jess convinces Leslie to help Janice. Janice tells Leslie that she is abusively beaten by her father, and her so-called friends have just gossiped about it to the entire seventh grade. Leslie comforts Janice by telling her that everyone will forget about it in a week. That night, May Belle tells Jess that she followed him and Leslie to the creek. He makes her swear never to follow them again nor to tell their mother.

On Easter, Jess and Leslie go to church with Jess&#x27;s family. While she calls the story of Jesus &quot;beautiful&quot;, she doubts it. This upsets May Belle, who believes God will damn Leslie to hell when she dies. That week, rain turns the dry creek bed into a rushing river. By Wednesday evening, Jess is too scared to swing over the river, while Leslie remains unafraid. On Thursday morning, Miss Edmunds calls Jess and invites him to Washington, D.C. to visit the Smithsonian Museum. When he returns home, Leslie is dead: The rope broke as she swung over the creek to Terabithia, hit her head and drowned.

Jess asks his father whether Leslie is in hell; his father assures him she isn&#x27;t. Using a large branch, Jess crosses the stream to Terabithia, where he makes a funeral wreath for Leslie. May Belle, who has followed him, makes it halfway across the branch before becoming too scared to continue. Jess guides her back to land.

Jess&#x27;s teacher, Mrs. Myers, tells him that when her husband died, people tried to make her forget, but she didn&#x27;t want to. Using scrap lumber left behind by the Burkes, Jess builds a bridge across the dry creek bed. He puts flowers in May Belle&#x27;s hair, leads her across the bridge, and begins to play Terabithia, with May Belle as the new queen and Jess as the king.

==Characters==

* Jesse Aarons – In the beginning of the novel, he is habitually fearful, angry and depressed due to his family struggles. He also has a crush on his music teacher, Miss Edmunds, which plays an integral role in the final events of the story. After meeting and then ultimately losing Leslie, he is transformed, in that he becomes courageous and lets go of his anger and frustration.
* Leslie Burke – An intelligent, talented, imaginative, outgoing girl, it is she who creates the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia. Her talents include gymnastics, creative writing, swimming and running. Jesse thinks highly of her, and they are loyal friends. She is a newcomer to his school, and not socially accepted by the other students. She dies when she falls into the creek Jesse and Leslie used to cross into Terabithia after the rope snaps, sustaining a head injury that keeps her unconscious until she drowns.
* May Belle Aarons – One of Jesse&#x27;s younger sisters. She is described as the only one of his siblings with whom he feels comfortable. However, because she is six years to his 10, she does not fit the mold of the ideal confidante to him, leaving him still desperate for companionship. She is closest to him from the beginning, and like him, feels that she does not have a place in the family. She is the first of his sisters to learn about Terabithia, and becomes the queen after Leslie&#x27;s death. She is welcomed into his world because of being the only one who to show any sort of empathy for, or acceptance of, him in his family.
* Ellie and Brenda Aarons – Jesse&#x27;s two older sisters. They are never mentioned separately within the novel and are rarely portrayed in a positive light. They continually ask for favors from their mother and boss their younger siblings around. It is only near the climax of the story, after hearing of Leslie&#x27;s death, that they express some concern for their brother.
* Joyce Ann Aarons – Jesse&#x27;s four-year-old youngest sister. She is mainly tended to by the mother and has no significant role in the story, but as May Belle describes her, she is &quot;nothing but a baby&quot;.
* Janice Avery – The school bully at Lark Creek. She is very overweight and tends to become very offended when people tease her for being so. Janice has a crush on Willard Hughes, which Jesse and Leslie use to trick her. Her father beats her and she secretly smokes. Also, her face is used on the giant troll living in Terabithia for the 2007 movie.
* Miss Edmunds – The somewhat unconventional and controversial music teacher, whom Jesse greatly admires. Edmunds invites him to go to the Smithsonian Museum, which leads Leslie to go to Terabithia by herself. As a result, Leslie is alone when she falls from the rope and drowns.
* Prince Terrien – A puppy that Jesse gave Leslie for Christmas. He is the guardian and court jester of Terabithia. In the novel, he is referred to as P.T.
* Gary Fulcher – He and Jesse both hope to be the fastest kid in the fifth grade; he serves as another bully in the story, but he is not quite as mean as Janice Avery.
* Mrs. Myers – Jesse and Leslie&#x27;s teacher, given the nickname &quot;Monster Mouth Myers&quot;. She favors Leslie, and tells Jesse after Leslie&#x27;s death that she was the best student Myers had ever had. Her husband had also died, and she explains to Jesse a little about grief from her own experience.
* William and Judith (Hancock) Burke – Leslie&#x27;s parents, novelists who come to the story&#x27;s location for their work. Mother—book writer, Father—political writer. Unlike most of the locals, they do not watch or own a television. Leslie calls William and Judith &quot;Bill and Judy&quot;, respectively.

==Reception==
At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said, &quot;Paterson, who has already earned regard with her historical fiction set in Japan, proves to be just as eloquent and assured when dealing with contemporary American children—and Americans of very different backgrounds at that.&quot; Children&#x27;s author Jean Fritz wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;With great skill Mrs. Paterson takes Jess to the depths of this nightmare and then brings him back, along with all he has learned in Terabithia—a survivor and certainly equal to the demands.&quot; According to &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;, &quot;Jess and his family are magnificently characterized; the book abounds in descriptive vignettes, humorous sidelights on the clash of cultures, and realistic depictions of rural school life. The symbolism of falling and of building bridges forms a theme throughout the story, which is one of remarkable richness and depth, beautifully written.&quot; In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1976 to 1985, literary critic Zena Sutherland wrote of &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;, &quot;The poignant story is all the more effective because Paterson lets Jesse express his grief and guilt rather than telling readers that he feels them. There is no glossing-over; nor is there a reaching for dramatic effect.&quot;

==Literary significance==
The novel&#x27;s content has been the frequent target of censors. It ranks number 8 on the American Library Association list of most commonly challenged books in the United States for 1990–1999. On the ALA list for 2000–2009 it ranks No. 28. The challenges stem from death being a part of the plot; Jesse&#x27;s frequent use of the word &quot;lord&quot; outside of prayer; allegations that it promotes secular humanism, New Age religion, occultism, and Satanism; and for use of offensive language.

The novel is often featured in English studies classes in Ireland, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Philippines, Ecuador, the United Kingdom, Costa Rica, Panama, South Africa and the United States.

In 2012, the novel was ranked number ten among all-time best children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. Two other books by Paterson made the top 100.

==Adaptations==
Two films have been made based on the novel, both with the original title. One was a PBS TV movie made in 1985, starring Annette O&#x27;Toole, Julian Coutts, and Julie Beaulieu.

The second was a theatrical film released on February 16, 2007, directed by the co-creator of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot; and former Hanna-Barbera animator Gabor Csupo and starring Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Bailee Madison, and Zooey Deschanel; the adaptation was done in part by David Paterson himself. While the giant troll was adapted, the Dark Master, Squogres (a race of squirrel/ogre-like creatures), Hairy Vultures, and many unidentified creatures were created for the film.

A musical stage adaptation (&quot;supported by a lyrical score&quot;) entitled &quot;The Bridge to Terabithia&quot; is listed for sale by Stageplays.com, credited to Paterson and Stephanie S. Tolan, another children&#x27;s writer. It was catalogued by the Library of Congress in 1993, with primary credit to Steve Liebman for the music, as &quot;Bridge to Terabithia: a play with music&quot; (New York: S. French, c1992).

<text>Duke of Suffolk was a title that has been created three times in the peerage of England.

The dukedom was first created for William de la Pole, who had already been elevated to the ranks of earl and marquess, and was a powerful figure under Henry VI.

The second creation was for Charles Brandon, a favourite of Henry VIII; his two sons successively inherited the title, but left no more heirs.

The third creation of the dukedom of Suffolk was for Henry Grey, 3rd Marquess of Dorset, in 1551. The duke also held the title Baron Ferrers of Groby (1300). These titles became forfeit when the duke was attainted in 1554.

<text>Ethical consumerism (alternatively called ethical consumption, ethical purchasing, moral purchasing, ethical sourcing, or ethical shopping and also associated with sustainable and green consumerism) is a type of consumer activism based on the concept of dollar voting. People practice it by buying ethically made products that support small-scale manufacturers or local artisans and protect animals and the environment, while boycotting products that exploit children as workers, are tested on animals, or damage the environment.

The term &quot;ethical consumer&quot;, now used generically, was first popularised by the UK magazine &quot;Ethical Consumer&quot;, first published in 1989. &quot;Ethical Consumer&quot; magazine&#x27;s key innovation was to produce &quot;ratings tables&quot;, inspired by the criteria-based approach of the then-emerging ethical investment movement. &quot;Ethical Consumer&quot;″s ratings tables awarded companies negative marks (and overall scores, starting in 2005) across a range of ethical and environmental categories such as &quot;animal rights&quot;, &quot;human rights&quot;, and &quot;pollution and toxics&quot;, empowering consumers to make ethically informed consumption choices and providing campaigners with reliable information on corporate behaviour. Such criteria-based ethical and environmental ratings have subsequently become commonplace both in providing consumer information and in business-to-business corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings such as those provided by Innovest, Calvert Foundation, Domini, IRRC, TIAA–CREF, and KLD Analytics. Today, Bloomberg and Reuters provide &quot;environmental, social, and governance&quot; ratings directly to the financial data screens of hundreds of thousands of stock market traders. The nonprofit Ethical Consumer Research Association continues to publish &quot;Ethical Consumer&quot; and its associated website, which provides free access to ethical rating tables.

Although single-source ethical consumerism guides such as &quot;Ethical Consumer&quot;, Shop Ethical, and the Good Shopping Guide are popular, they suffer from incomplete coverage. User-generated ethical reviews are more likely, long-term, to provide democratic, in-depth coverage of a wider range of products and businesses. The Green Stars Project promotes the idea of including ethical ratings (on a scale of one to five green stars) alongside conventional ratings on retail sites such as Amazon or review sites such as Yelp.

The term &quot;political consumerism&quot;, first used in a study titled &quot;The Gender Gap Reversed: Political Consumerism as a Women-Friendly Form of Civic and Political Engagement&quot; from authors Dietlind Stolle and Michele Micheletti (2003), is identical to the idea of ethical consumerism. However, in this study, the authors found that political consumerism as a form of social participation often went overlooked at the time of writing and needed to be accounted for in future studies of social participation. However, in &quot;From Ethical Consumerism to Political Consumption&quot;, author Nick Clarke argues that political consumerism allows for marginalized groups, such as women, to participate in political advocacy in non-bureaucratic ways that draw attention to governmental weaknesses. Political consumerism has also been criticised on the basis that &quot;it cannot work&quot;, or that it displays class bias. The widespread development of political consumerism is hampered by substantial mundane consumption, which does not afford reflective choice, along with complexities of everyday life, which demand negotiations between conflicting moral and ethical considerations.

== The Consumer groups==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, people in industrialized countries began formal consumer movements to ensure that they would get value for their money in terms of the things they purchased. These movements focused on the unfair labor practices of the companies, and on labelling requirements of food, cosmetics, drugs, etc. Examples of the consumer movements were the Consumer League which was established in New York, US in 1891, National Consumers League created in US in 1898, and Consumers Council which was established during World War I in Great Britain. During this time workers were neither well-paid nor did they have secure employment with benefit of social protection; similarly, working conditions were decent and the Irish Trade Union movement focused the ILO policy of campaigning for decent work wherever there was an opportunity for job improvement or job creation.

==Basis==

===Global morality===

In &quot;Unequal Freedoms: The Global Market As An Ethical System&quot; (1998), John McMurtry argues that all purchasing decisions imply some moral choice, and that there is no purchasing that is not ultimately moral in nature. This mirrors older arguments, especially by the Anabaptists (e.g. Mennonites, Amish), that one must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability for all harms done at any distance in space or time to anyone by one&#x27;s own choices. Some interpretations of the book of Genesis from the Judeo-Christian scriptures appears to direct followers towards practising good stewardship of the Earth, under an obligation to a God who is believed to have created the planet for people to share with other creatures. A similar argument presented from a secular humanist point of view is that it is simply better for human beings to acknowledge that the planet supports life only because of a delicate balance of many different factors.

===Spending as morality===
Some trust criteria, e.g. creditworthiness or implied warranty, are considered to be part of any purchasing or sourcing decision. However, these terms refer to broader systems of guidance that would, ideally, cause any purchasing decision to disqualify offered products or services based on non-price criteria that affect the moral rather than the functional liabilities of the entire production process. Paul Hawken, a proponent of natural capitalism, refers to &quot;comprehensive outcomes&quot; of production services as opposed to the &quot;culminative outcomes&quot; of using the product of such services. Often, moral criteria are part of a shift away from commodity markets towards a service economy where all activities, from growing to harvesting to processing to delivery, are considered part of the value chain for which consumers are &quot;responsible&quot;.

Andrew Wilson, Director of the UK&#x27;s Ashridge Centre for Business and Society, argues that &quot;Shopping is more important than voting&quot;, and that the disposition of money is the most basic role we play in any system of economics. Some theorists believe that it is the clearest way that we express our actual moral choices: if we say we care about something but continue to buy in a way that has a high probability of risk of harm or destruction to that thing, we don&#x27;t really care about it; we are practising a form of simple hypocrisy. Ethical consumerism is widely explained by psychologists using the theory of planned behavior, which attributes a consumer&#x27;s choices to their perceived sense of control, social norms, and evaluation of the consequences. However, recent research suggests that a consumer&#x27;s ethical obligation, self-identity, and virtues may also influence their buying decisions. 

In an effort by churches to advocate moral and ethical consumerism, many have become involved in the Fair Trade movement:
* Ten Thousand Villages is affiliated with the Mennonite Central Committee
* SERRV International is partnered with Catholic Relief Services and Lutheran World Relief
* Village Markets of Africa sells Fair Trade gifts from the Lutheran Church in Kenya
* Catholic Relief Services has their own Fair Trade mission in CRS Fair Trade

==Standards and labels==
A number of standards, labels and marks have been introduced for ethical consumers, such as:

* B corporation
* Co-op Marque
* Dolphin safe
* EKOenergy for electricity agreements
* Equal Exchange
* Ethical Consumer Best Buy label
* Fairtrade
* Free-range poultry
* FSC-certified sustainably sourced wood
* Grass fed beef
* Green America Seal of Approval
* Halal (religious standard)
* Kosher (religious standard)
* Local food
* MSC-certified sustainably sourced seafood
* No Pork No Lard (semi-religious standard)
* Organic food
* Organic Trade Association
* Product Red
* Rainforest Alliance certified
* Recycled/recyclable
* Respects Your Freedom
* Shade-grown coffee
* Social Accountability 8000
* Union-made
* Vegan

Along with disclosure of ingredients, some mandatory labelling of the origins of clothing or food is required in all developed nations. This practice has been extended in some developing nations so that, for example, every item carries the name, phone number and fax number of the factory where it was made so a buyer can inspect its conditions. This can also be used to show that the item was not made by child labour or &quot;prison labor&quot;, the use of which to produce export goods is banned in most developed nations. Such labels have also been used for boycotts, as when the merchandise mark Made in Germany was introduced in 1887.

These labels serve as tokens of some reliable validation process, some instructional capital, much as does a brand name or a nation&#x27;s flag. They also signal some social capital, or trust, in some community of auditors that must follow those instructions to validate those labels.
Some companies in the United States, though currently not required to reduce their carbon footprint, are doing so voluntarily by changing their energy use practices, as well as by directly funding (through carbon offsets), businesses that are already sustainable—or that are developing or improving green technologies for the future.

In 2009, Atlanta&#x27;s Virginia-Highland neighborhood became the first Carbon-Neutral Zone in the United States. Seventeen merchants in Virginia-Highland allowed their carbon footprint to be audited. Now, they are partnered with the Valley Wood Carbon Sequestration Project—thousands of acres of forest in rural Georgia—through the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The businesses involved in the partnership display the Verus Carbon Neutral seal in each store front and posted a sign prominently declaring the area&#x27;s Carbon Neutral status. (CCX ceased trading carbon credits at the end of 2010 due to inactivity in the U.S. carbon markets, although carbon exchanges were intended to still be facilitated.)

Some theorists suggest the amount of social capital or trust invested in nation-states (or &quot;flags&quot;) will continue to decrease, and that placed in corporations (or &quot;brands&quot;) will increase. This can only be offset by retrenched national sovereignty to reinforce shared national standards in tax, trade, and tariff laws, and by placing the trust in civil society in such &quot;moral labels&quot;. These arguments have been a major focus of the anti-globalization movement, which includes many broader arguments against the amoral nature of markets. However, the economic school of Public Choice Theory pioneered by James M. Buchanan has offered counter-arguments based on an economic demonstration of this theory of &quot;amoral markets&quot;, which lack ethics or morals, versus &quot;moral governments&quot;, which are tied to ideas of justice.

==Research==
GfK NOP, the market research group, made a five-country study of consumer beliefs about the ethics of large companies. The countries surveyed were Germany, the United States, Britain, France, and Spain. More than half of respondents in Germany and the US believed there is a serious deterioration in standards of corporate practice. Almost half of those surveyed in Britain, France, and Spain held similar beliefs.

About a third of respondents told researchers they would pay higher prices for ethical brands, though the perception of various companies&#x27; ethical or unethical status varied considerably from country to country.

The most ethically perceived brands were The Co-op (in the UK), Coca-Cola (in the US), Danone (in France), Adidas (in Germany), and Nestlé (in Spain). Coca-Cola, Danone, Adidas, and Nestlé did not appear anywhere in the UK&#x27;s list of 15 most ethical companies. Nike appeared in the lists of the other four countries but not in the UK&#x27;s list.

In the UK, The Co-operative Bank has produced an Ethical Consumerism Report (formerly the Ethical Purchasing Index) since 2001. The report measures the market size and growth of a basket of &#x27;ethical&#x27; products and services, and valued UK ethical consumerism at GBP36.0 billion (~USD54.4 billion) in 2008, and GBP47.2 billion (USD72.5 billion) in 2012.

A number of organizations provide research-based evaluations of the behavior of companies around the world, assessing them along ethical dimensions such as human rights, the environment, animal welfare, and politics. Green America is a not-for-profit membership organization founded in 1982 that provides the &quot;Green American Seal of Approval&quot; and produces a &quot;Responsible Shopper&quot; guide to &quot;alert consumers and investors to problems with companies that they may shop with or invest in.&quot; The Ethical Consumer Research Association is a not-for-profit workers&#x27; co-operative founded in the UK in 1988 to &quot;provide information on the companies behind the brand names and to promote the ethical use of consumer power.&quot; They provide an online searchable database under the name Corporate Critic or Ethiscore. The Ethiscore is a weightable numerical rating designed as a quick guide to the ethical status of companies, or brands in a particular area, and is linked to a more detailed ethical assessment. &quot;Alonovo&quot; is an online shopping portal that provides similar weightable ethical ratings termed the &quot;Corporate Social Behavior Index&quot;.

==Related concepts==

===Conscientious consumption===

Conscientious consumerism is when people make a habit of buying goods from ethical companies and avoid impulsive buying from unethical ones, in order to contribute positively in political, social, and environmental ways. Such a consumer rationalizes unnecessary and even unwanted consumption by saying that &quot;it&#x27;s for a good cause.&quot; As a result, the consumer buys pink ribbons during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, green products to support the environment, candy and popcorn from school children, greeting cards and gift wrap from charities, and other such often-unwanted objects. The consumer avoids considering whether the price offered is fair, whether a small cash donation would be more effective with far less work, or even whether selling the item is consistent with the ostensible mission, such as when sports teams sell candy.

Some of these efforts are based on concept brands: the consumer is buying an association with women&#x27;s health or environmental concerns as much as they are buying a tangible product.

Conscientious consumption involves people who are &quot;more focused on real needs than artificially created craves,&quot; such as not continually following trend cycles in consumer industries.

Conscientious consumerism has become more popular in recent years, with consumers becoming more aware of the impact of their purchases on society and the environment. This trend has led to the growth of companies that prioritize corporate social responsibility and ethical practices in their operations to reinforce customer loyalty. However, some companies have taken note of this shift towards conscientious consumerism and started deceptive marketing to convey a false impression that their product is environmentally friendly. This green marketing tactic is called greenwashing, which is prevalent in the cosmetic industry. Greenwashing has a negative impact on consumer trust with brands and cosmetic products that are marketed as green.

===Alternative giving===

In response to an increasing demand for ethical consumerism surrounding gift-giving occasions, charities have promoted an alternative gift market, in which charitable contributions are made on behalf of the gift &quot;recipient&quot;. The &quot;recipient&quot; receives a card explaining the selected gift, while the actual gift item (frequently agricultural supplies or domestic animals) is sent to a family in a poor community.

==Criticism==
Critics argue that ethical consumerism has limited ability to affect structural change. Berkey (2021) has argued that ethical consumerism focuses on individual consumer behavior rather than systemic change can create a false sense of efficacy and distract from more effective methods of creating change, such as collective action and policy reform. Some say the actual effect of ethical consumerism is the preponderance of niche markets, while others argue that because it is difficult for consumers to obtain enough information about the outcomes of a given purchase, this prevents them from making informed ethical choices. Critics have also argued that the uneven distribution of wealth prevents consumerism, ethical or otherwise, from fulfilling its democratic potential.

One study suggests that &quot;Buying Green&quot; serves as a license for unethical behavior. In their 2009 paper, &quot;Do Green Products Make Us Better People?&quot;, Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong write:

In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products. However, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products. Together, the studies show that consumption is more tightly connected to our social and ethical behaviors in directions and domains other than previously thought.

In a 2010 &quot;The Guardian&quot; article, British environmental writer and activist George Monbiot argued that green consumers who do not articulate their values are part of &quot;a catastrophic mistake,&quot; on the grounds that such consumerism &quot;strengthens extrinsic values&quot; (those that &quot;concern status and self-advancement&quot;), thereby &quot;making future campaigns less likely to succeed&quot;.

James G Carrier, Associate at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, draws on Karl Marx&#x27;s concept of commodity fetishism to argue that ethical consumption does not help consumers lead a more moral life, nor does it influence businesses as intended. The goal of ethical consumption at a personal level is to lead a more moral life, and that capitalism causes commodities to be presented in such a way that they are perceived without regard for the labor that is represented by the product, the labor that was involved in allowing that commodity to exist. The goal at a public level is for consumers to use their purchasing power to put pressure on companies to change the way they conduct business. Marx argued that under capitalism, the presentation of goods obscures the people and processes behind their production.

Carrier begins by giving examples of products that have been presented in a way that misrepresents their context. He first points to the images of growers commonly found on fair trade coffee packaging. The image suggests self-reliance and ignores the dependence upon immigrant wage workers who harvest the coffee. Fairtrade coffee is viewed as a direct link to the grower without a middle man. However, there are many parties involved such as the roasters, shippers, wholesalers, and retailers of the product. Carrier also discusses fictitious commodities, which are things that are not produced in the conventional sense, material or not, and can be appropriated for commercial gain. The conceptual categories of ethicality need to be legible to consumers in order for a consumer to be able to participate in ethical consumption. Sellers use imagery to satisfy that need, and the images they use become emblematic and representational of the values of ethical consumers, and in some ways the presentation of these images fetishize the product, and the pervasiveness of such images begins to shape ethicality, as the absence of these images also signifies the absence of those same values. In short: it is difficult to buy ethical products because there are many aspects to commodities that consumers are unable to be fully aware of; fully informed decisions are almost impossible to make. Consumers see the images that sellers use as a means of virtue signaling, and purchase those products with the intent of ethical consumption because they believe that those images have been produced conscientiously to represent conceptual categories of &quot;ethical.&quot;

Carrier extends commodity fetishism to include nature reserves because they are advertised and because people are urged to visit the landscapes and animals for a fee. For example, parks in Jamaica show colorful fish and coral growth on pamphlets to attract tourists. These photos fetishize coastal waters by ignoring the other important ecological aspects of the water. In Montego Bay, Jamaica, environmentalists argue that tourism has damaged the park. Run-off feeds into the waterways and sea-grass beds integral to local nutrient cycles are removed.

The strategic direction of the consumer&#x27;s attention further mystifies and fetishizes the object of consumption. Carrier points out that the moment of consumer choice is emphasized rather than the context that leads people to seek ethicality. He believes that more attention should be paid to how the consumer acquired their moral leanings.

<text>Sir Richard Stafford Cripps (24 April 1889 – 21 April 1952) was a British Labour Party politician, barrister, and diplomat.

A wealthy lawyer by background, Cripps first entered Parliament at a by-election in January 1931, and was one of a handful of Labour frontbenchers to retain his seat at the October general election that year. He became a leading spokesman for the left-wing and for co-operation in a Popular Front with Communists before 1939, in which year the Labour Party expelled him. During this time he became intimately involved with Krishna Menon and the India League. 

During World War II (1939-1945), Cripps served from May 1940 to January 1942 as Ambassador to the USSR, with major responsibility for building rapport with Hitler&#x27;s greatest foe. Back in London in early 1942, he became a member of the War Cabinet of the wartime coalition. In March 1942, Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent him to India to negotiate with Indian leaders about Indian cooperation in the war effort in exchange for dominion status after the war. Cripps failed in this mission, as his proposals were too radical for Churchill and the Cabinet, while being too conservative for Mahatma Gandhi and other Indian leaders. Nonetheless, he kept the trust and friendship of V. K. Krishna Menon, allowing him to retain a role in Indian affairs, including as a member of the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India and, ultimately, in having a voice in the selection of the final Viceroy in 1947. From November 1942 he served as Minister of Aircraft Production, an important post, but one outside the inner War Cabinet.

Cripps rejoined the Labour Party in February 1945, and after the war he served in the 1945-1951 Attlee ministry, first as President of the Board of Trade and between 1947 and 1950 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Labour Party member and historian Kenneth O. Morgan claimed of his role in the latter position that he was &quot;the real architect of the rapidly improving economic picture and growing affluence from 1952 onwards&quot;.

The economy improved after 1947, benefiting from American money given through grants from the Marshall Plan as well as from loans. However, the pound had to be devalued in 1949. Cripps kept the wartime rationing-system in place to hold down consumption during an &quot;age of austerity&quot;, promoted exports and maintained full employment with static wages. The public especially respected &quot;his integrity, competence, and Christian principles&quot;.

==Early life==

Cripps was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Charles Cripps, a barrister and later Conservative MP, and the former Theresa Potter, the sister of Beatrice Webb and Catherine Courtney. Cripps grew up in a wealthy family and was educated at Winchester College, where the Headmaster described him as &quot;a thoroughly good fellow&quot; and at University College London, where he studied chemistry. He left science for the law, and in 1913 was called to the bar by the Middle Temple. He served in the First World War as a Red Cross ambulance driver in France, and then managed a chemical factory producing armaments. He practised as a barrister during the 1920s, where he specialised in patent cases, and was reported to be the highest paid lawyer in England. He was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1927.

Cripps was a member of the Church of England and in the 1920s became a leader in the World Alliance to Promote International Friendship through the Churches, as his father had been. From 1923 to 1929 Cripps was the group&#x27;s treasurer and its most energetic lecturer.

==Joining the Labour Party==
At the end of the 1920s, Cripps moved to the left in his political views, and in 1930 he joined the Labour Party. The next year, he was appointed Solicitor-General in the second Labour government, and received the then customary knighthood. In 1931, Cripps was elected to Parliament in a by-election for Bristol East. As an MP, he was a strong proponent of Marxist social and economic policies, although he had strong faith in evangelical Christianity, and did not subscribe to the Marxist rejection of religion.

In the 1931 general election, Cripps was one of only three former Labour ministers to hold his seat, alongside George Lansbury, who subsequently became party leader, and Clement Attlee, deputy leader.

In 1932, Cripps helped found and became the leader of the Socialist League, which was composed largely of intellectuals and teachers from the Independent Labour Party who rejected its decision to disaffiliate from Labour. The Socialist League put the case for an austere form of democratic socialism. He argued that on taking power the Labour Party should immediately enact an Emergency Powers Act, allowing it to rule by decree and thus &quot;forestall any sabotage by financial interests&quot;, and also immediately abolish the House of Lords.

In 1936, Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee dissociated itself from a speech in which Cripps said he did not &quot;believe it would be a bad thing for the British working class if Germany defeated us&quot;. Cripps also opposed British rearmament:
:&quot;Money cannot make armaments. Armaments can only be made by the skill of the British working class, and it is the British working class who would be called upon to use them. To-day you have the most glorious opportunity that the workers have ever had if you will only use the necessity of capitalism in order to get power yourselves. The capitalists are in your hands. Refuse to make munitions, refuse to make armaments, and they are helpless. They would have to hand the control of the country over to you.&quot;

Cripps was an early advocate of a united front against the rising threat of fascism and he opposed an appeasement policy towards Nazi Germany. In 1936, he was the moving force behind a Unity Campaign, involving the Socialist League, the Independent Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain, designed to forge electoral unity against the right. Opposed by the Labour leadership, the Unity Campaign failed in its intentions. Rather than face expulsion from Labour, Cripps dissolved the Socialist League in 1937. &quot;Tribune&quot;, set up as the campaign&#x27;s newspaper by Cripps and George Strauss, survived. In early 1939, however, Cripps was expelled from the Labour Party for his advocacy of a Popular Front with the Communist Party, the Independent Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and anti-appeasement Conservatives.

In 1938, Cripps visited Jamaica to investigate violence which took place during mass strikes. During one of the political meetings he spoke at, the audience included the future pioneer of black civil rights in Britain, Billy Strachan, who had been taken by his father to hear Cripps speak. During this same meeting, the People&#x27;s National Party was formed.

==Second World War==

When Winston Churchill formed his wartime coalition government in 1940 he appointed Cripps Ambassador to the Soviet Union in the view that Cripps, who had Marxist sympathies, could negotiate with Joseph Stalin who had a nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany through the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. When Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, Cripps became a key figure in forging an alliance between the western powers and the Soviet Union.

In 1942, Cripps returned to Britain and made a broadcast about the Soviet war effort. The popular response was phenomenal, and Cripps rapidly became one of the most popular politicians in the country, despite having no party backing. He was appointed a member of the War Cabinet, with the jobs of Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons, and was considered for a short period after his return from Moscow as a rival to Churchill in his hold on the country.

===Mission to India===
Churchill responded by sending Cripps to India in March 1942. The goal of the Cripps Mission was to negotiate an agreement with the nationalist leaders that would keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for self-government after the war. Cripps designed the specific proposals himself, but they were too radical for Churchill and the Viceroy, and too conservative for Mahatma Gandhi and the Indians, who demanded immediate independence. No middle way was found and the mission was a failure.

===Minister of Aircraft Production===
In November 1942, Cripps stepped down from being Leader of the House of Commons and was appointed Minister of Aircraft Production, a position outside the War Cabinet in which he served with substantial success until May 1945, when the wartime coalition ended. A supporter of Air Chief Marshal Harris&#x27;s strategic bombing campaign against Germany, Cripps stated in a July 1943 broadcast that &quot;the more we ... can destroy from the air the industrial and transport facilities of the Axis, the weaker will become his resistance. ... The heavier our air attack, the lighter will be the total of our casualties&quot;.

Cripps was unhappy with the British black propaganda campaign against Germany. When Cripps discovered details of the German radio work of Sefton Delmer (through the intervention of Richard Crossman) he wrote to Anthony Eden, then Foreign Secretary: &quot;If this is the sort of thing that is needed to win the war, why, I&#x27;d rather lose it.&quot; Delmer was defended by Robert Bruce Lockhart who pointed out the need to reach the sadist in the German nature.

In February 1945, Cripps rejoined the Labour Party.

==After the war==
When Labour won the 1945 general election, Clement Attlee appointed Cripps President of the Board of Trade, the second most important economic post in the government. Although still a strong socialist, Cripps had modified his views sufficiently to be able to work with mainstream Labour ministers. In Britain&#x27;s desperate post-war economic circumstances, Cripps became associated with the policy of &quot;austerity&quot;. As an upper-class socialist, he held a puritanical view of society, enforcing rationing with equal severity against all classes. Together with other individuals, he was instrumental in the foundation of the original College of Aeronautics, now Cranfield University, in 1946. The Stafford Cripps Learning and Teaching Centre on Cranfield&#x27;s campus is named after him.

In 1946, Soviet jet engine designers approached Stalin with a request to buy jet designs from Western sources to overcome design difficulties. Stalin is said to have replied: &quot;What fool will sell us his secrets?&quot; However, he gave his assent to the proposal, and Soviet scientists and designers travelled to the United Kingdom to meet Cripps and request the engines. To Stalin&#x27;s amazement, Cripps and the Labour government were willing to provide technical information on the Rolls-Royce Nene centrifugal-flow jet engine designed by RAF officer Frank Whittle, along with discussions of a licence to manufacture Nene engines. The Nene engine was promptly reverse-engineered and produced in modified form as the Soviet Klimov VK-1 jet engine, later incorporated into the MiG-15 which flew in time to deploy in combat against UN forces in North Korea in 1950, causing the loss of several B-29 bombers and cancellation of their daylight bombing missions over North Korea. Ironically, a US fighter Aircraft that fought the M15 was the Grumman F9F Panther which was equiped with the US Version of the Nene-Pratt &amp; Whitney J42

Also in 1946, Cripps returned to India as part of the Cabinet Mission, which proposed formulae for independence to the Indian leaders. The other two members of the delegation were Lord Pethick-Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India, and A. V. Alexander, the First Lord of the Admiralty. However, the solution devised by the three men, known as the Cabinet Mission Plan, was unsatisfactory to the Indian National Congress mainly its principal leaders, and instead of having to hold together the emerging one nation, Indian National Congress leaders travelled further down the road that eventually led to Partition.

In 1947, amid a growing economic and political crisis, Cripps tried to persuade Attlee to retire in favour of Ernest Bevin; however, Bevin was in favour of Attlee remaining. Cripps was instead appointed to the new post of Minister for Economic Affairs. Six weeks later Hugh Dalton resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Cripps succeeded him, with the position of Minister for Economic Affairs now merged into the Chancellorship. He increased taxes and continued strategic rationing which muted consumption to boost the balance of trade and stabilise the Pound Sterling seeing Britain trade its way out of a real risk of fiscal and economic gloom. He was among those who brought about the nationalisation of strategic industries such as coal and steel.

Amid financial problems from 1948 to 1949, Cripps maintained a high level of social spending on housing, health, and other welfare services, while also maintaining the location of industry policy. Personal incomes and free time continued to rise, as characterised by cricket and football enjoying unprecedented booms, together with the holiday camps, the dance hall, and the cinema. In his last budget as Chancellor (1950), the housebuilding programme was restored to 200,000 per annum (after having previously been reduced due to government austerity measures), income tax was reduced for low-income earners as an overtime incentive, and spending on health, national insurance, and education was increased.

During the period Cripps imposed harsh foreign currency restrictions on private and commercial travellers, he was paying for his grandchildrens&#x27; swiss boarding school and for both his daughter&#x27;s and his own swiss sanitorium.

Cripps had suffered for many years from colitis, inflammation of the lower bowel; a condition aggravated by stress. In 1950, his health broke down and he was forced to resign his office in October. He resigned from Parliament the same month, and at the resulting by-election on 30 November he was succeeded as the MP for Bristol South East by Anthony Wedgwood Benn.

==Personal life==
Cripps was the sororal nephew of Beatrice Webb and Catherine Courtney. His mother died when he was four years old. His stepmother, Marian Ellis, had a profound influence on him. He was married to Isobel Swithinbank, who became the Honourable Lady Cripps, daughter of Harold William Swithinbank, better known as Dame Isobel Cripps (1891–1979), and had four children
* Sir John Stafford Cripps (1912–1993), journalist and campaigner, who was a conscientious objector in the Second World War and in 1937 married Ursula Davy, having four sons and two daughters.
* Isobel Diana Cripps (1913–1985) who died unmarried
* (Anne) Theresa Cripps (1919–1998), who was married 1945 to Sir Robert Cornwallis Gerald St. Leger Ricketts, 7th Bt, and had two sons and two daughters. The elder son Sir Tristram Ricketts, 8th Bt. succeeded his father, died in 2007, and has been succeeded by his own son, Sir Stephen Ricketts, 9th Bt.
* Peggy Cripps, born Enid Margaret Cripps (1921–2006), children&#x27;s author and philanthropist. Peggy Cripps shocked much British opinion by marrying the black African aristocrat Nana Joseph Emmanuel Appiah (1918–1990), a relative of the Ashanti king of Ghana, in June 1953. Peggy Appiah had one son and three daughters. Her son is the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah (b. May 1954 London), the Laurance S. Rockefeller professor of philosophy at Princeton University. Her three daughters live in Namibia, Nigeria, and Ghana and have eight children among them. One of them is the actor Adetomiwa Edun.

Cripps was a vegetarian, certainly for health reasons and possibly also for ethical reasons. &quot;Cripps suffered from recurring illness which was alleviated by nature cure and a vegetarian diet...&quot;. His male-line descendants are in remainder to the barony Parmoor. In 1989, a Blue Plaque was unveiled at 32 Elm Park Gardens, Chelsea to mark the site of Cripps&#x27; birth.

==Death==
Cripps died of cancer on 21 April 1952 while in Zürich, Switzerland 3 days shy of his 63rd birthday. He was cremated at Sihlfeld Crematorium in Zürich. His ashes are buried in the churchyard in Sapperton, Gloucestershire, and his wife is buried beside him.

The Stafford Cripps estate on Gee Street in the former Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury is named in his honour; the three blocks are called Parmoor, Sapperton and Cotswold, after the Cripps family title and Sir Stafford Cripps resting place.

<doc id="441860" wikidata="Q200850" url="?curid=441860" title="János Kádár">
<text>János József Kádár (; ; 26 May 1912 – 6 July 1989), born János József Czermanik, was a Hungarian Communist leader and the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, a position he held for 32 years. Declining health led to his retirement in 1988, and he died in 1989 after being hospitalized for pneumonia.

Kádár was born in Fiume in poverty to a single mother. After living in the countryside for some years, Kádár and his mother moved to Budapest. He joined the Party of Communists in Hungary&#x27;s youth organization, KIMSZ, and went on to become a prominent figure in the pre-1939 Communist party, eventually becoming First Secretary. As a leader, he would dissolve the party and reorganize it as the Peace Party, but the new party failed to win much popular support.

After World War II, with Soviet support, the Communist party took power in Hungary. Kádár rose through the party ranks, serving as Interior Minister from 1948 to 1950. In 1951, he was imprisoned by the government of Mátyás Rákosi but was released in 1954 by reformist Prime Minister Imre Nagy. On 25 October 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution, Kádár replaced Ernő Gerő as General Secretary of the Party, taking part in Nagy&#x27;s revolutionary government. A week later, he broke with Nagy over his decision to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. After Soviet intervention in Hungary, Kádár was selected to lead the country. He ordered Nagy to be executed shortly after coming to power. He gradually moderated, releasing the majority of remaining prisoners of this period in an amnesty in 1963. His leadership was characterized by unrelenting &quot;Realpolitik&quot;; for a long time, he successfully maneuvered between Moscow&#x27;s wishes, local interests and the expectations of the Western world. In an interview with a Western journalist, he called himself a &quot;toiler for compromise&quot;.

Kádár was succeeded by Károly Grósz as General Secretary on 22 May 1988. Grósz would only serve a year in this post due to the fall of Communism in Europe in 1989. During his time as leader of Hungary, Kádár pushed for an improvement in standards of living. Kádár increased international trade with non-communist countries, in particular those of Western Europe. Kádár&#x27;s policies differed from those of other Communist leaders, such as Nicolae Ceaușescu, Enver Hoxha, and Wojciech Jaruzelski, all of whom favored more orthodox interpretations of Marxism–Leninism. Kádár&#x27;s reformist policies and the increasing commercial ties to the Western World would in turn worsen relations with Leonid Brezhnev in the Soviet Union. As the leader of Hungary, Kádár attempted to liberalize the Hungarian economy with a greater focus on consumer goods, in what would become known as Goulash Communism.

== Childhood ==
János Kádár was an illegitimate son of the soldier János Krezinger and the servant maid Borbála Czermanik. Krezinger came from a smallholder family of Pusztaszemes, Somogy County. Kádár&#x27;s father had Bavarian German origin. The mother, Borbála Csermanek was born in Ógyalla (today Hurbanovo, Slovakia) to a landless Slovak father and Hungarian mother. The parents of Borbála were too poor to provide schooling for the girl, thus the teenager girl had to work as maid in various villas. Soon Borbála got a job in the popular seaside resort town, Opatija. Krezinger met with Borbála during his military service in Opatija, the story however how they met is unknown. Kádár only met his father once, in 1960, when Kádár was already the leader of the country.

Kádár was born out of wedlock in Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia) on 26 May 1912. The infant was registered in the Italian version of his name: Giovanni Giuseppe Czermanik (In Hungarian: János József Czermanik) because he was born in the Italian established Santo Spirito Hospital. Being an illegitimate child, the infant could only receive the Czermanik family name of his mother. Abandoned, Borbála gave birth to János in the middle of the holiday season, as no one wanted to employ a single mother with a child. His mother, Borbála went to look for Krezinger, but his family wanted nothing to do with them. She walked ten kilometres to the city of Kapoly where she persuaded the Bálint family to care for her child for a fee. Borbála found work in Budapest. To avoid the pronunciation problems of the Slovak-origin Czermanik name in Budapest, the family changed the orthography of their name to Csermanek.

Although Kádár&#x27;s foster father, Imre Bálint, was in charge, it was Bálint&#x27;s brother, Sándor Bálint, that Kádár would remember as his true foster father. While Imre served in the army during World War I, Sándor was left to take care of Kádár. Sándor was the only man Kádár had a good relationship with throughout his early childhood. Kádár started working at an early age and helped Sándor take care of his sick wife. Kádár years later recalled how his early experiences moved him towards Marxist–Leninism. He recalls how he was accused of setting a building on fire when the true culprit was the corrupt inspector&#x27;s son. Suddenly in 1918, at the age of six, Borbála reclaimed him, moved him to Budapest and enrolled him in school. In school he got bullied for his bumpkin manners and his peasant talk.

Borbála worked hard to ensure that Kádár would get a good education. In the summer time, Kádár would find work in the countryside. He was seen as &quot;alien&quot; by his contemporaries, in the countryside they would call him a &quot;city boy&quot; while in the city they would call him a &quot;country boy&quot;. Then in 1920, Borbála got pregnant again; the father left soon. Kádár helped take care of his half-brother, Jenő. At the Cukor Street Elementary School, Kádár proved to be a bright student. He skipped school often, and his mother tried beatings to make it stop. Classes were easy for him and he skipped school to play sports. He did read often however, but his mother was unimpressed by this and sarcastically asked him if he was a &quot;gentleman of leisure&quot;. Kádár left school at the age of fourteen in 1926. Kádár started his apprenticeship as a car mechanic. After he was turned down as a car mechanic, he started work as an apprentice of Sándor Izsák, chief Hungarian representative of Torpedo Typewriter Company in the autumn of 1927. Typewriter mechanics had a high standing among the working class, there were only 160 of them in the country.

== Party work ==
His first meeting with Marxist literature came in 1928 after he won a junior chess competition organised by the Barbers Trade Union. His prize was Friedrich Engels&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot;. The tournament organiser explained to Kádár that if he didn&#x27;t understand it after his first reading, he should re-read it again until he understood it. Kádár followed his advice, even if his friends were &quot;unimpressed&quot; by his reading. As he later noted later in his life, he did not understand the reading but it got him thinking: &quot;Immutable laws and connections in the world which I had not suspected.&quot; While it may be true that as Kádár comments that the book had great influence over him, it was in 1929 when he was fired after he flared up at his employer after he talked condescendingly towards Kádár. When the Great Depression hit Hungary, Kádár was the first to be fired. What ensued was low paid jobs and poverty. He later became unemployed, and it was this experience which brought him into contact with the Communist Party of Hungary. According to Kádár he became a member of the party in 1931.

In September 1930, Kádár took part in an organised trade union strike. The strike was crushed by the authorities, and many of his fellow Communists were arrested. In the aftermath of the failed strike, he supported the party by gathering signatures for candidates of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Bloc, an attempt by the Communist Party to create a front which would win over new supporters. This attempt was thwarted by the authorities, and new arrests ensued. In June 1931, he joined the Communist youth organization, the Communist Young Workers&#x27; Association (KIMSZ). He joined the Sverdlov party cell, named after Soviet Yakov Sverdlov. His alias within the party became János Barna. During his early membership, the party was illegal, following the crushing of the 1919 Hungarian Soviet Republic. In December 1931, the authorities had been able to track him down, and Kádár was arrested on charges of spreading communism, and being a communist. He denied the charges, and because of lack of evidence, was released. He was however under constant police surveillance, and after some days, he was back in contact with KIMSZ. He was given new responsibilities, and by May 1933 he became a member of the KIMSZ Budapest committee. Because of his promotion in the Communist hierarchy, he was given a new alias, Róna. The party suggested, but Kádár rejected, the offer of studying at the Lenin Institute in Moscow, claiming that he could not leave his family alone. His advance up the hierarchy came to an end when he was arrested on 21 June 1931 with other Communist activists. Kádár cracked because of police brutality, when he later confronted his fellow arrested Communists, he realized he had made a mistake and denied and retracted all his confessions. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Because of his confessions to the police, he was suspended from KIMSZ.
After being released for parole, he was politically in limbo. The hope of rejoining the Communist party was shattered by the Comintern&#x27;s decision to dissolve the national Communist party in Hungary. The few remaining members of the party were told to infiltrate and work cooperatively with the Social Democratic Party of Hungary and trade unions. Kádár had in the meantime been able to persuade himself that it was because of changes within the party, and not his confessions, which had led to none of his associates making contact with him. He did, at the same time, have four more months of his prison sentence to serve before being released. In prison Kádár met with Mátyás Rákosi, a commissar of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and a renowned political prisoner. While Kádár later claimed that there grew a father-son like bond between them, the more plausible truth is that there grew a &quot;somewhat adolescent cheekiness&quot; between the two. In prison, Rákosi interrogated Kádár, and came to the conclusion that his confessions were due to his &quot;shortcomings&quot;. After being released from prison for good, some former party activists made contact with him and instructed Kádár to infiltrate the Social Democratic Party with them. Within the party, Kádár and his associates made no secret of their Marxist views, frequently talking about the struggles of the working class and their gaze, which was directed towards the Soviet Union.

Kádár still lived in poverty, and found it hard to blend in with the upper working class and the intelligentsia. Paradoxically, his main Communist contact in the Social Democratic Party was a sculptor named György Goldmann. Kádár evolved into an effective speaker on &quot;bread and butter issues&quot;, but failed at having any success on more serious and complex topics. In 1940 he was recalled to the party&#x27;s ranks. At the beginning of its re-founding, the party liked to use members without any police records, therefore Kádár was given more responsibilities within the infiltration of the Social Democratic Party. During May and June the police arrested and rounded up several party activists, including Goldman, but Kádár had managed to go into hiding. As early as May 1942, Kádár became a member of the newly formed Central Committee of the Communist party, mostly due to the lack of personnel, seeing that the majority of them had been sent to prison. István Kovács, the acting party leader from December 1942, said; &quot;he [Kádár] was extremely modest, a clever man but not then theoretically trained&quot;. Kovács brought Kádár into the party leadership and gave him a seat in the Secretariat of the Central Committee. By January 1943, had been able to get in touch with some seventy to eighty members, but this effort was torn apart by a new round of mass arrests, with Kovács being among them.

== First Secretaryship ==
The new leadership after the last mass arrest consisted of Kádár as First Secretary, Gábor Péter, István Szirmai and Pál Tonhauser. During Kádár&#x27;s first tenure as leader of the party, he faced many problems, the most important being that the Communists were becoming increasingly irrelevant in a fast-changing situation, mostly because of the Hungarian government&#x27;s continuing interference. In a meeting with Árpád Szakasits, a left-leaning Social Democrat, Kádár was asked to stop the party&#x27;s illegal infiltration of his party. This meeting led to criticism being mounted against him during a Central Committee plenum meeting. In February 1936, Peter came up with an idea; his idea was to dissolve the party so that party members independently could spread communism, while a small secret leadership structure could keep itself together for some years. This, he said, would stop the continuing mass arrest of the Communist party personnel and in turn strengthen the party for the future. While at the beginning Kádár was against such an idea, the idea grew on him and came to the conclusion that instead of dissolving the party, he would pretend to dissolve it and rename the party which would effectively throw the Hungarian authorities off their trail. The so-called &quot;new party&quot; was formed in August under the name, Peace Party. This decision was not supported by all, and the Moscow-based Hungarian Communists led by Mátyás Rákosi condemned the decision and domestic militants. Kádár disagreed with the criticism laid against him, claiming it was a &quot;tactical retreat&quot; which led to the renaming of the party, but with no changes to either the party&#x27;s principles or structures. His attempted plan to fool the police failed, and the police continued arresting Hungarian Communists. Later in his life, this would be one of the few topics of his life Kádár would refuse to discuss.

After the German invasion of Hungary, the Peace Party, with other parties, established the Hungarian Front, the party&#x27;s potential allies were still very wary of them. Therefore, the Popular Front was never able to win much support amongst the populace. In the aftermath of the invasion, the party under Kádár&#x27;s leadership started partisan operations and created their own Military Committee. Kádár tried to cross the border into Yugoslavia in hope of making contact with the Yugoslav partisans and their leader, Josip Broz Tito. At the same time, Kádár probably hoped to establish better, and stronger, relations with the USSR; something they had been trying to do since 1942. Kádár was given a new identity as an army corporal trying to cross the Hungarian-Yugoslav border. This attempt failed, and he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. The authorities never figured out his real identity therefore members such as Rákosi thought he was a secret agent for the police. There is however no hard proof for these accusations, and incompetence remains the sole plausible reason. It was later proven, when SS officer Otto Winckelmann reported to Berlin that Kádár had been arrested, they had mistakenly confused Kádár for another Communist.

Kádár, while in prison, was able to send out messages to Péter, and other high-ranking party members, they were able to orchestrate a scheme to free him. In the meantime, the leader of Hungary Miklós Horthy was conspiring against the German occupiers. There were rumours that claim that Horthy tried to get in contact with Kádár, but did not know that he was in prison. Horthy was deposed by the German government and replaced by Arrow Cross Party leader Ferenc Szálasi. Szálasi&#x27;s policies had an immediate effect on Kádár; he had emptied the prison Kádár lived in and sent them to Nazi concentration camps. Kádár was able to escape and made his way back to Budapest. Immediately after his return to Budapest, Kádár headed the Communist party&#x27;s military committee. The committee tried to persuade workers to help the Soviet forces, but was not able to muster much support from the populace, therefore its effect was marginal at best. After the Soviet victory in Budapest, he changed his name from Csermanek to Kádár, literally meaning &quot;cooper&quot; or &quot;barrel-maker&quot;.

==From leadership to show trials==

===Post–World War II career===
After the Soviet liberation of Hungary, the Soviet–Hungarian Communist leadership sent Zoltán Vas and the new Kremlin-approved Central Committee of the Communist Party of Hungary; Kádár became a member. Kádár rose, not because of ideology, or technical knowledge, but rather for his organisational skills. He helped organize the Party&#x27;s headquarters and designed its membership card. The Soviet troops stationed in Hungary committed mass rapes and pillaged Budapest and the countryside. Kádár told the Interior Minister, &quot;The Soviet command caused really big difficulties in our work, especially in the beginning, and they still do&quot;. Kádár was appointed deputy chief of police. He had sharp critics, such as Rákosi&#x27;s party deputy Ernő Gerő who felt his decision to dissolve the party during the war was a rash decision. Other peers felt he had been over-promoted. Nevertheless, he moved up to the Politburo of the Communist Party of Hungary. In February 1945, Rákosi was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of Hungary.

Rákosi&#x27;s leadership consisted of Mihály Farkas the Minister of Defence. Kádár and Béla Kovács noted with puzzlement the leadership&#x27;s total lack of interest in the domestic Communist&#x27;s experience and outlook. As head of cadres, Kádár supervised membership appointments to the party. This position gave him contacts, some of whom would become very important to him in his later life. After failing to secure a majority in Parliament after the 1945 Hungarian parliamentary election, the Communist leadership started the divide and conquer strategy known as salami tactics. Kádár became a prominent figure during the period between 1945 and the 1947 Hungarian parliamentary election. Kádár had evolved a sense of rivalry with the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, claiming the party was &quot;thrashing&quot; them in government, and that they made it impossible for the Communists to negotiate policy with the Hungarian trade unions.

In 1946, Kádár campaigned for the Communist party in workers districts and factories. These areas were heavily contested between the Communists and the Social Democrats. The Communists were able to persuade the Social Democrats to hold elections in factories where the Communists held the majority. The clear majority results gained by the Communists during this election prompted the Social Democrats to postpone the rest of the election. At the 3rd Congress of the Communist Party of Hungary, Kádár was appointed one of Rákosi&#x27;s two deputies. He was appointed deputy because of social and ethnic background, the majority of the leadership were of Jewish origins and were intellectuals, Kádár was however a &quot;Hungarian&quot; worker. In the aftermath of his appointment, he enrolled himself in Russian lessons and grew fond of reading, his favorite being &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;.

Kádár, as in 1946, was a Communist party campaigner, and was described by historian Robert Gough as &quot;a great success&quot;. The Communists won a majority in Parliament in 1947, and because of the escalation of the Cold War, the Soviet leadership ordered them to drop all pretense of liberal democracy and create an undisguised Communist one-party state. Kádár played an active role in the creation of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party; created when the Social Democratic Party was forced to merge with the Communists. At the unification congress Kádár made a speech which made little impact on the Communist movement in Hungary. In May 1948 Kádár visited the Soviet Union, and for the first and last time in his life he saw Joseph Stalin with his own eyes. During his visit to the USSR, Kádár&#x27;s brother, Jenő died. On 5 August 1948 László Rajk was appointed to the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Kádár took his place as Minister of the Interior.

As Interior Minister, Kádár did not have real power as the most important organizations of internal state security operated under the direct control of Rákosi and his closest associates. Unlike his Eastern European counterparts, Kádár was unenthusiastic about the role; Enver Hoxha, after being introduced to Kádár by Rákosi, thought &quot;how he didn’t seem to me to be of the right stuff to be minister of internal affairs&quot;. In 1949, Borbála died, and Kádár married Mária Tamáska. Just as Stalin had launched a Great Purge against those with knowledge of the pre-Stalin party, Rákosi launched a purge against those who had worked in Hungary, and not in the Soviet Union, during World War II and before. In retrospect, it is clear that Kádár was appointed Minister of the Interior with the deliberate aim to involve him in the &quot;show trial&quot; of Laszlo Rajk, although the investigations and proceedings were handled by the State Security Agency with the active participation of the Soviet Secret Police. Rákosi later boasted of &quot;spending many a sleepless night&quot; in unraveling the threads of the &quot;anti-party conspiracy&quot; led by Rajk and his &quot;gang.&quot; During the public trial, Rákosi personally gave instructions to the judge over the phone. Rákosi would later attempt to blame Kádár for Rajk&#x27;s death.

Later in his life, Rákosi said that Rajk died screaming &quot;Long live Stalin! Long live Rákosi!&quot; Instead, Tibor Szönyi died without saying a word and András Szalai crying. Farkas and Gábor Péter, upon the death of Rajk and the others, said &quot;provocateurs to their last breaths&quot;. This event didn&#x27;t assure Kádár; making him doubt if any of the accusation leveled against his coworkers were true. It is believed that after Rajk&#x27;s death Kádár was seen vomiting; these rumours have not been confirmed by any sources from that time. Rákosi contacted him the following the day, asking him why he was in such a bad mood, and continued, saying; &quot;Did the executions affect you that much?&quot;. According to certain rumours, which are probably not reliable, Kádár visited Rákosi to tell him about his reaction to the execution. Later, during a party presentation to a college, Kádár emphasized party austerity. This presentation might reflect on Kádár&#x27;s reaction to Rajk&#x27;s execution and his revelation that he might become the next victim of government repression. When holding his presentation, he was described by his audience as a &quot;haggard&quot;, &quot;distressed&quot; and as a man under a lot of &quot;strain&quot;.

===Show trial and rehabilitation===
Rákosi told Kádár, in late August 1950, that former Social Democratic party leader Árpád Szakasits had confessed to being a spy for the capitalistic countries. Szakasits&#x27; imprisonment would be the start of a long purge against former social democrats, trade union officials, and high-standing Communist party members. The purge would last until 1953, the extent of the purge went so far that the ÁVH held files on around one million, literally one-tenth of Hungary&#x27;s population at that time. The purges were enacted when Rákosi and his associates were in the middle of the country&#x27;s collectivising agriculture and the rapid industrialisation efforts. Ernő Gerő&#x27;s ambition to make Hungary a land made out of &quot;steel and iron&quot; led to a decline in the national standards of living.

At this point, Rákosi had started distrusting Kádár, leading Kádár to resign as Ministry of the Interior citing health and stress reasons for his choice. Kádár believed the longer down the ladder he climbed there was a bigger chance of not being purged. In this he was wrong, and he along with new Minister of the Interior Sándor Zöld, were criticised for not doing a proper enough job to remove the anti-socialist movement within the country. Kádár would later refute most of the allegations the Rákosi leadership put against, but to no avail, and for every letter he wrote to refute an allegation another allegation was put against him. He eventually gave up and in one letter Kádár even admitted to his faults; claiming that he was still &quot;politically backward&quot; and &quot;ideologically untrained&quot; when he headed the prewar Communist Party as First Secretary. Kádár concluded that he had been fooled by the capitalists and therefore offered his resignation from active politics. Instead of resigning, and losing his seats in the Central Committee and the Politburo, his memberships in these organisations were renewed at the party congress. Believing that his position was secure and that Rákosi had given him another chance, Kádár thought nothing more of it. This proved to be wrong, and by the end of March 1951, Rákosi informed the Soviets that Kádár along with Zöld and Gyula Kállai were to be imprisoned.

On 18 April 1951, Zöld had killed his whole family and committed suicide after finding out that Rákosi and his associates had decided to purge him from the party. When the authorities found their bodies, they decided to quickly gather the remaining two before they did something rash too. Kádár, who did not know what had just taken place, was at home taking care of his wife Maria, who had been in and out of the hospital. The Hungarian leadership decided to call him, asking Kádár to meet them at the party headquarters, when leaving his home he was stopped by ÁVH officers and the ÁVH head Gábor Péter.

Only a year later, Kádár found himself the defendant in a show trial of his own—on false charges of having been a spy of Horthy&#x27;s police. This time it was Kádár who was beaten by the security police and urged to &quot;confess&quot;. During Kádár&#x27;s interrogation, the ÁVH reportedly beat him, smeared him with mercury to prevent his skin pores from breathing, and had his questioner urinate into his pried-open mouth. However, at the 1954 rehearing of his trial, when asked if he had been maltreated, he answered &quot;Physically no&quot;, a denial he repeated in later interviews towards the end of his life. It is thought by some that the stories of brutality were intended to portray him as a victim of Stalinist torture in order to counter his image at home and abroad as a Soviet stooge.

Kádár was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. His incarceration included three years of solitary confinement, conditions far worse than he suffered while imprisoned under the Horthy regime. He was released from prison in July 1954, after the death of Stalin and the appointment of Imre Nagy as Prime Minister in 1953. Kádár accepted the offer to act as party secretary in the heavily industrialized 13th district of Budapest. He rose to prominence quickly, building up a large following among workers who demanded increased freedom for trade unions.

== Role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 ==

Rákosi was forced to resign in 1956, replaced by Gerő. On 23 October 1956, students marched through Budapest intending to present a petition to the government. The procession swelled as several people poured onto the streets. Gerő replied with a harsh speech that angered the people, and police opened fire. It proved to be the start of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. As the revolution spread throughout the country, Nagy was called back as Prime Minister.

The Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party decided to dissolve itself and to reorganize itself as the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. On 25 October 1956, Kádár was elected General Secretary. He was also a member of the Nagy Government as Minister of State.

Nagy began a process of liberalization, removing state controls over the press, releasing many political prisoners, and expressing wishes to withdraw Hungary from the Warsaw Pact. He formed a coalition government. Although the Soviet leaders issued a statement that they strove to establish a new relationship with Hungary on the basis of mutual respect and equality, in the first days of November, the Presidium of the Soviet Communist Party took a decision to crush the revolution by force.

On 1 November 1956, Kádár, together with Ferenc Münnich, left Hungary for Moscow with the support of the Soviet Embassy in Budapest. There the Soviet leaders tried to convince him that a &quot;counter-revolution&quot; was unfolding in Hungary that must be put to an end at any cost. He only agreed to change sides when the Soviet leaders informed him that the decision had already been taken to crush the revolution with the help of the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary. He was also told that unless he agreed to become prime minister in the new government, the Rákosi–Gerő leadership would be reinstalled. Although he was under duress, he did not, by his own admission, resist as much as he could have. In a speech given on 12 April 1989, he confessed to having played a role in Nagy&#x27;s execution, calling it his &quot;own personal tragedy.&quot; Writing in 1961, American journalist John Gunther said that &quot;Kádár today looks like a man pursued by shadows, a walking corpse.&quot;

At dawn on 4 November 1956, Soviet tank divisions moved into Budapest with orders to crush the revolution. The proclamation of the so-called Revolutionary Workers&#x27;-Peasants&#x27; Government of Hungary, headed by Kádár, was broadcast from Szolnok the same day. He announced a &quot;Fifteen Point Programme&quot; for this new government:
# To secure Hungary&#x27;s national independence and sovereignty
# To protect the people&#x27;s democratic and socialist system from all attacks
# To end fratricidal fighting and to restore order
# To establish close fraternal relations with other socialist countries on the basis of complete equality and non-interference
# To cooperate peacefully with all nations irrespective of form of government
# To quickly and substantially raise the standard of living for all in Hungary
# Modification of the Five Year Plan, to allow for this increase in the standard of living
# Elimination of bureaucracy and the broadening of democracy, in the workers&#x27; interest
# On the basis of the broadened democracy, management by the workers must be implemented in factories and enterprises
# To develop agricultural production, abolish compulsory deliveries and grant assistance to individual farmers
# To guarantee democratic elections in the already existing administrative bodies and Revolutionary Councils
# Support for artisans and retail trade
# Development of Hungarian culture in the spirit of Hungary&#x27;s progressive traditions
# The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, acting in the interest of our people, requested the Red Army to help our nation smash the sinister forces of reaction and restore order and calm in Hungary
# To negotiate with the forces of the Warsaw Pact on the withdrawal of troops from Hungary following the end of the crisis

The 15th point was withdrawn after pressure from the USSR that a 200,000 strong Soviet detachment be garrisoned in Hungary. This development allowed Kádár to divert huge defense funds to welfare. Nagy, along with Georg Lukács, Géza Losonczy and László Rajk&#x27;s widow, Júlia, fled to the Yugoslav Embassy. Kádár promised them safe return home at their request but failed to keep this promise as the Soviet party leaders decided that Imre Nagy and the other members of the government who had sought asylum at the Yugoslav Embassy should be deported to Romania. Later on, a trial was instituted to establish the responsibility of the Imre Nagy Government in the 1956 events. Although it was adjourned several times, the defendants were eventually convicted of treason and conspiracy to overthrow the &quot;democratic state order&quot;. Imre Nagy, Pál Maléter and Miklós Gimes were sentenced to death and executed on 16 June 1958. Géza Losonczy and both died in prison under suspicious circumstances during the court proceedings.

==Kádár era==

Kádár assumed power in a critical situation. The country was under Soviet military administration for several months. The fallen leaders of the Communist party took refuge in the Soviet Union and were planning to regain power in Hungary. The Chinese, East German, and Czechoslovak leaders demanded severe reprisals against the perpetrators of the &quot;counter-revolution&quot;. Despite the distrust surrounding the new leadership and the economic difficulties, Kádár was able to normalize the situation in a remarkably short time. This was due to the realization that, under the circumstances, it was impossible to break away from the Communist bloc. The Hungarian people realized that the promises of the West to help the Hungarian revolution were unfounded and that the logic of the Cold War determined the outcome. Hungary remained part of the Soviet sphere of influence with the tacit agreement of the West. Though influenced strongly by the Soviet Union, Kádár enacted a policy slightly contrary to that of Moscow, for example, allowing considerably large private plots for farmers of collective farms.
Starting in the early 1960s, he gradually lifted Rákosi&#x27;s more draconian measures against free speech and movement, and also eased some restrictions on cultural activities. He even tolerated samizdat publications to a far greater extent than his counterparts. As Kádár once said, &quot;what kind of regime is it that doesn&#x27;t have even a tiny little opposition, just for show? But there&#x27;s also the fact that they can&#x27;t go beyond a certain limit, and if they try, they&#x27;ll pay for it.&quot; Hungarians had much more freedom than their Eastern Bloc counterparts to go about their daily lives.

The result was a regime that was far more humane than other Communist regimes, especially so when compared to the first seven years of undisguised Communist rule in Hungary. However, it was not a liberal regime in any sense. The Communists maintained absolute control over the government and also encouraged citizens to join party organizations. The National Assembly, like its counterparts in other Communist countries, did little more than approve decisions already made by the MSZMP and its Politburo. Voters were presented with a single list from the Patriotic People&#x27;s Front, which was dominated by the MSZMP. All prospective candidates had to accept the Front&#x27;s program in order to stand; indeed, Kádár and his advisers used the Front to weed out candidates they deemed unacceptable. The secret police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs III, while operating with somewhat more restraint than their counterparts in other Eastern Bloc countries (such as the AVH), was nonetheless a feared tool of government control. The Hungarian media remained under censorship that was considered fairly onerous by Western standards, but far less stringent than was the case in other Communist countries.

As a result of the relatively high standard of living, and more relaxed restrictions on speech, movement, and culture than that of other Eastern Bloc countries, Hungary was generally considered one of the better countries in which to live in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The dramatic fall in living standards after the fall of Communism led to some nostalgia about the Kádár era. However, the relatively high living standards had their price in the form of 58% of GDP or US$22 bn state debt left behind by the Kádár régime. As mentioned above, the regime&#x27;s cultural and social policies were still somewhat authoritarian; their impact on contemporary Hungarian culture is still a matter of considerable debate.

While Kádár&#x27;s regime remained strictly loyal to the Soviet Union in foreign policy, its intent was to establish a national consensus around its domestic policies. In notable contrast to Rákosi, who repeatedly declared &quot;he who is not with us is against us&quot; in his rally speeches, Kádár declared that &quot;who is not against us is with us.&quot; Kádár was the first Eastern European leader to develop closer ties with the Social Democratic parties of Western Europe. He also attempted to establish good relations with the United States, though could only go so far due to the limitations imposed by Kádár&#x27;s ultimate commitment to communist internationalism.

When Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Kádár had some kind words about the deposed Soviet leader, which was a unique gesture among Eastern Bloc leaders. Consequently, his relationship with Brezhnev was somewhat uneasy for a long time. Kádár tried to mediate between the leaders of the Czechoslovak reform movement of 1968 and the Soviet leadership to avert the danger of military intervention. When the Soviet leaders took the decision to intervene to suppress the Prague Spring, Kádár decided to participate in the Warsaw Pact operation.

The regression towards Stalinist economic policies in the Soviet Union at the end of the 1960s had an impact in Hungary. In the political-economic structure, which had been left untouched by the reforms, it was relatively easy for the &quot;conservative&quot; political offensive with Soviet support to take hold. Zoltán Komócsin, Béla Biszku and Árpád Pullai, who had aimed to stop economic reform and seize political power, defeated the reform wing, which was led by Rezső Nyers, Lajos Fehér and Jenő Fock, and implemented the renewed centralisation of the economy. Unqualified people were appointed to leading positions en masse, and a campaign was launched against certain sections of the intelligentsia.

At the same time, the oil crisis caused an unfavorable turn in the world economy for the Hungarian economy: Hungarian goods for export were paid less, while imported goods needed for economic growth and modernization became more expensive. Thus, the increase in real wages, which the leadership considered important, could only be covered by loans. In the early 1970s, credit was cheap and was freely used: by the end of the 1970s, $8 billion in debt had been accumulated.

During Kádár&#x27;s rule, international tourism increased dramatically, with many tourists (including Hungarians who emigrated in 1956 or before) from Canada, the US, and Western Europe bringing much-needed money into Hungary. Hungary built strong relations with developing countries and many foreign students arrived. The &quot;Holy Crown&quot; (referred to in the media as the &quot;Hungarian Crown&quot;, so as to prevent it carrying a political symbolism of the Horthy régime or an allusion to Christianity) and regalia of Hungarian kings were returned to Budapest by the United States in 1978.

Kádár was known for his simple and modest lifestyle and avoided the self-indulgence persona of other Communist leaders. Although he was never personally corrupt, he sometimes overlooked corrupt dealings of other members of the elite to an extent. To strengthen his popularity, whispering propaganda depicted him as totally intolerant to corruption by his underlings. Playing chess was one of his favorite pastimes. However, he was an avid hunter (hunting for sport used to be an aristocratic hobby before 1945 in Hungary and this pattern continued during the Communist era when it became a cherished pastime and occasion for the new elite to informally socialize and to get drunk), and was a member of an exclusive hunting association made up by Party leaders and other dignitaries. He wasn&#x27;t a heavy drinker though and demanded modesty when he was present. Also, foreign guests often visited the Hungarian forests too, from the Shah of Iran through Fidel Castro to the King of Nepal, and Leonid Brezhnev hunted with Kádár several times. The popularity of this &quot;gentleman&#x27;s sport&quot; among Communist leaders was marked by political decisions made on hunting excursions.
Kádár was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize (1975–76). He was also awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 April 1964.

==Resignation, final months and death==
János Kádár held power in Hungary until the &quot;apparat coup&quot; in the spring of 1988, when he resigned under pressure as General Secretary in the face of mounting economic difficulties and his own ill health. At a party conference in Budapest on 22 May 1988, at which half a dozen of his Politburo associates were also removed, Kádár announced his resignation and was officially replaced as General Secretary by Prime Minister Károly Grósz, who strove to continue Kádár&#x27;s policies in a modified form adapted to the new circumstances. Kádár was named instead to the ceremonial position of Party President. He did not wish to be re-elected to the Political Committee, the most important decision-making body of the party. Nevertheless, the post allowed him the right to speak at Central Committee plenums. By May 1989, Kádár was showing unmistakable signs of mental deterioration; his increasingly incoherent speeches were becoming an embarrassment. Doctors encouraged him to go on vacation in the Crimea, but Kádár balked; he remembered how Rákosi had died in Soviet exile and was wary of the same fate. On 8 May, Kádár lost his remaining posts; officially, he retired for health reasons. Grósz and his associates were in no position to resist, as they were in turn were being sidelined by a faction of young &quot;radical reformers&quot; who set out to dismantle Communism altogether and rehabilitate the party&#x27;s image ahead of free elections due the following year.

On 12 April 1989 Kádár unexpectedly appeared and made a rambling, incoherent speech at the closed meeting of the Central Committee. By the &quot;right of the last word&quot;, he wanted to confess about his negotiations in 1956 in Moscow (about which he never spoke publicly) and about the conviction and execution of Imre Nagy. But all the changes that occurred in Eastern Europe and Hungary between 1956 and 1989 were at the same time in his head. An interpretation of Kádár&#x27;s thoughts was offered by Mihály Kornis, who gave a lecture about János Kádár. According to Miklós Németh&#x27;s testimony, in late May or early June 1989, a few weeks before his death, Kádár asked a Roman Catholic priest to hear his confession, which some have theorised as a sign of a possible revelation and conversion to Christianity.

Kádár died of cancer on 6 July 1989 aged 77, three months before the formal end of the regime he had largely created. Kádár&#x27;s grave at the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest was vandalized on 2 May 2007 as a number of his bones, including his skull, were dug up and stolen, along with his wife Mária Tamáska&#x27;s urn. A message reading &quot;murderers and traitors may not rest in holy ground 1956–2006&quot; (taken from a song titled &quot;Neveket akarok hallani&quot; written by the rock band &quot;Kárpátia&quot;) was written nearby. The two dates refer to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the 2006 protests in Hungary, respectively. This act was received with widespread revulsion across the political and societal spectrum in Hungary. Police investigations focused on extremist right-wing groups which had been aspiring to &quot;carry out an act that would create a big bang.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Kádár&#x27;s legacy remains disputed in Hungary. Supporters of Kádár argue that the Kádár era was one of peace and stability with widespread job security and robust social protections for average people. Others argue that although Kádár increased the standard of living for Hungarians, and instituted broad liberalization, the country was still fundamentally a dictatorship and a Soviet satellite state.

He is considered one of the most influential figures of 20th century Hungarian history along with István Tisza and Miklós Horthy. A research has found that according to 6% of respondents he was &quot;the greatest Hungarian&quot;, finishing 3rd from a list of 10 choices.

Polls indicate that nostalgia for the Kádár era remains widespread in Hungary. According to a 2020 poll carried out by Policy Solutions in Hungary, 54 percent of Hungarians believe most people had a better life under Kádár, compared to 31 percent who say life for most people was worse under Kádár.

<text>The Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s) (or simply &quot;Staffords&quot; for short) was an infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Division. The regiment was formed in 1959 by the amalgamation of the South Staffordshire Regiment and the North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s), and in 2007 was amalgamated with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to become the 3rd Battalion, Mercian Regiment.

In 2014, the 3rd Battalion, Mercian Regiment was merged with the 1st and 2nd battalions, to create the 1st and 2nd battalions, Mercian Regiment (Cheshires, Worcesters and Sherwood Foresters, and Staffords).

The mascot of the Staffordshire Regiment was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier; each successive mascot took the name Watchman. The current serving mascot is known as Private Watchman VI and he carries out his duties as part of the Staffordshire Regimental Association.

The regiment was formed on 31 January 1959 by the amalgamation of the South Staffordshire Regiment and North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s).

In November 1960 the regiment undertook a six-month exercise in Kenya, followed by a year in Colchester and then a return to Kenya for a further two years. On the tour the regiment had to deal with a mutiny by the Ugandan Army. Returning home, the regiment was the last unit of the British Army to serve in East Africa.

A home tour in Dover followed in 1964. Then came a two-year posting to Berlin in 1968 followed by a tour in Sharjah in the Trucial States where the regiment again recorded a &#x27;last unit&#x27; distinction being the last unit to serve in Sharjah.

The regiment undertook a tour in Northern Ireland during the Troubles in 1972 before moving to Quebec Barracks in Osnabrück in 1973. Further tours in Northern Ireland were undertaken in 1974 and 1976. The regiment moved to Hyderabad Barracks in Colchester Garrison later in 1976 before undertaking another tour in Northern Ireland in 1979.

The regiment moved to Dale Barracks in Chester in 1991, to Abercorn Barracks in Ballykinler in 1994 and Clive Barracks in Shropshire in 1996. From their base in Shropshire, the 1st Battalion deployed to Hong Kong in 1996, shortly before it was handed back to China, and also to Northern Ireland for short periods and a six-month roulement tour to Belfast in 1997.

<text>AstraZeneca plc () (AZ) is a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with its headquarters at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus in Cambridge, United Kingdom. As of February 2025, AstraZeneca plc is the most highly valued British company in the world with a market capitalization of US$226 billion. It has a portfolio of products for major diseases in areas including oncology, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, infection, neuroscience, respiratory, and inflammation.

The company was founded in 1999 through the merger of the Swedish Astra AB and the British Zeneca Group (itself formed by the demerger of the pharmaceutical operations of Imperial Chemical Industries in 1993). Its portfolio includes primary and speciality care, coverage for rare diseases, and a robust global presence across various regions. Since the merger it has been among the world&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical companies and has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Cambridge Antibody Technology (in 2006), MedImmune (in 2007), Spirogen (in 2013) and Definiens (by MedImmune in 2014). It has its research and development concentrated in three strategic centres: Cambridge, United Kingdom; Gothenburg, Sweden and Gaithersburg in Maryland, U.S.

AstraZeneca traces its earliest corporate history to 1913, when Astra AB was formed by a large group of doctors and apothecaries in Södertälje. Throughout the twentieth century, it grew into the largest pharmaceutical company in Sweden. Its British counterpart, Zeneca PLC was formed in 1993 when ICI divested its pharmaceuticals businesses; Astra AB and Zeneca PLC merged six years later, with the chosen headquarters in the United Kingdom.

AstraZeneca&#x27;s primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index; it also has a secondary listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm. It is also listed on the American Nasdaq and is a Nasdaq-100 company. AstraZeneca has one of the highest market capitalisations of pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

==History==
Astra AB was founded in 1913 in Södertälje, Sweden, by 400 doctors and apothecaries. In 1993 the British chemicals company ICI (established from four British chemical companies) demerged its pharmaceuticals businesses and its agrochemicals and specialities businesses, to form Zeneca Group PLC. Finally, in 1999 Astra and Zeneca Group merged to form AstraZeneca plc, with its headquarters in London. In 1999, AstraZeneca identified a new location for the company&#x27;s US base, the &quot;Fairfax-plus&quot; site in North Wilmington, Delaware.

===2000–2006===
In September 2002, its drug Iressa (gefitinib) was approved in Japan as monotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. On 3 January 2004 Dr Robert Nolan, a former director of AstraZeneca, formed the management team of ZI Medical.

In December 2005, the company acquired KuDOS Pharmaceuticals, a UK biotech company, for £120 million. and entered into an anti-cancer collaboration agreement with Astex. That same year, the firm also became a Diamond Member of the Pennsylvania Bio commerce organisation.

In May 2006, following a collaborative relationship begun in 2004, AstraZeneca acquired Cambridge Antibody Technology for £702 million.

===2007–2012: The patent cliff and subsequent acquisitions===

In February 2007, AstraZeneca agreed to buy Arrow Therapeutics, a company focused on the discovery and development of anti-viral therapies, for US$150million. AstraZeneca&#x27;s pipeline, and &quot;patent cliff&quot;, was the subject of much speculation in April 2007 leading to pipeline-boosting collaboration and acquisition activities. A few days later AstraZeneca acquired US company MedImmune for about US$15.2 billion to gain flu vaccines and an anti-viral treatment for infants; AstraZeneca subsequently consolidated all of its biologics operations into a dedicated biologics division called MedImmune.

In December 2009, AstraZeneca acquired Novexel Corp, an antibiotics discovery company formed in 2004 as a spin-off of the Sanofi-Aventis anti-infectives division. Astra acquired the experimental antibiotic NXL-104 (CEF104) (CAZ-AVI) through this acquisition.

In December 2011, AstraZeneca acquired Guangdong BeiKang Pharmaceutical Company, a Chinese generics business.

In February 2012, AstraZeneca and Amgen announced a collaboration on treatments for inflammatory diseases. Then in April 2012, AstraZeneca acquired Ardea Biosciences, another biotechnology company, for $1.26 billion. In June 2012, AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb announced a two-stage deal for the joint acquisition of the biotechnology company Amylin Pharmaceuticals. It was agreed that Bristol Myers Squibb would acquire Amylin for $5.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.7 billion in debt, with AstraZeneca then paying $3.4 billion in cash to Bristol Myers Squibb, and Amylin being folded into an existing diabetes joint venture between AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb.

===2013 restructuring and beyond===

====2013====
In March 2013, AstraZeneca announced plans for a major corporate restructuring, including the closure of its research and development activities at Alderley Park in Cheshire and Loughborough in the UK and at Lund in Sweden, investment of $500million in the construction of a new research and development facility in Cambridge and the concentration of R&amp;D in three locations: Cambridge, Gaithersburg, Maryland (location of MedImmune, where it will work on biotech drugs), and Gothenburg in Sweden, for research on traditional chemical drugs. AstraZeneca also announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from London to Cambridge in 2016. That announcement included the announcement that it would cut 1,600 jobs; three days later it announced it would cut an additional 2,300 jobs. It also announced that it would focus on three therapeutic areas: Respiratory Inflammation &amp; Autoimmunity, Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolic Disease, and Oncology. In October 2013, AstraZeneca announced it would acquire biotech oncology company Spirogen for around US$440 million.

====2014====
On 19 May 2014, AstraZeneca rejected a &quot;final offer&quot; from Pfizer of £55 per share, which valued the company at £69.4billion (US$117billion). The companies had been meeting since January 2014. If the takeover had proceeded, Pfizer would have become the world&#x27;s biggest drug maker. The transaction would also have been the biggest foreign takeover of a British company. Many in Britain, including politicians and scientists, had opposed the deal. In July 2014 the company entered into a deal with Almirall to acquire its subsidiary Almirall Sofotec and its lung treatments including the COPD drug, Eklira. The US$2.1 billion deal included an allocation of US$1.2 billion for development in the respiratory franchise, one of AstraZeneca&#x27;s three target therapeutic areas announced the year before. In August 2014 the company announced it had entered into a three-year collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma on diabetic nephropathy.

In September 2014, the company joined forces with Eli Lilly in developing and commercialising its candidate BACE inhibitor – AZD3292 – used for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; this deal was projected to yield up to US$500 million AstraZeneca. In November 2014, the firm&#x27;s biologics R&amp;D operation, MedImmune, agreed to acquire Definiens for more than US$150 million. It also began a Phase I/II trial collaboration with Pharmacyclics and Janssen Biotech investigating combination treatments. Also in November, AstraZeneca agreed to sell its lipodystrophy treatment business to Aegerion Pharmaceuticals for more than US$325 million. In December, the company received accelerated FDA approval for Olaparib in the treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer who have a BRCA genetic mutation. A major criterion governing the drugs approval was, on average, its ability to shrink tumours in patients for 7.9 months.

====2015====
In February 2015, AstraZeneca announced it would acquire the US and Canadian rights to Actavis&#x27;s branded respiratory drug business for an initial sum of US$600 million. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Orca Pharmaceuticals to develop retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma inhibitors for use in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, which could generate up to US$122.5 million for Orca. The company also announced its plan to spend US$40 million creating a new subsidiary focused on small molecule anti-infectives – primarily in the research of the gyrase inhibitor, AZD0914, which was then in Phase II testing for the treatment of gonorrhea. The company underwrote twenty out of thirty-two seats of a new Cambridge– Gothenburg service by Sun-Air of Scandinavia.

In March, the company stated that it would co-commercialise naloxegol along with Daiichi Sankyo in a deal worth up to US$825 million. In April, the firm announced a number of collaborations worth an estimated US$1.8 billion; first, to develop and commercialise MEDI4736, with Celgene, for use against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and multiple myeloma with AstraZeneca receiving US$450 million. The second of two deals is an agreement to study a combination treatment of MEDI4736 and Innate Pharma&#x27;s Phase II anti-NKG2A antibody IPH2201 for up to US$1.275 billion. The company&#x27;s MedImmune arm also launched collaborative clinical trials with Juno Therapeutics, investigating combination treatments for cancer; these trials involved combinations of MEDI4736 and one of Juno Therapeutics&#x27; CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell candidates. In June, the company revealed a partnership with Eolas Therapeutics on the Eolas Orexin-1 Receptor Antagonist (EORA) program for smoking cessation and other treatments. In July, AstraZeneca announced the sale of its rights to Entocort (budesonide) to Tillotts Pharma for $215 million. In July, Genzyme announced it would acquire the rare cancer drug Caprelsa (vandetanib) from AstraZeneca for up to US$300 million.

In August, the company announced it had acquired the global rights to develop and commercialise Heptares Therapeutics&#x27; drug candidate HTL-1071, which focuses on blocking the adenosine A2A receptor, in a deal worth up to US$510 million. That same month, the company&#x27;s MedImmune subsidiary acquired exclusive rights to Inovio Pharmaceuticals&#x27; INO-3112 immunotherapy under an agreement which could net more than US$727.5 million for Inovio. INO-3112 targets Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. In September, Valeant licensed Brodalumab from the company for up to US$445 million. On 6 November, it was reported that AstraZeneca had acquired ZS Pharma for US$2.7 billion. In December, the company announced its intention to acquire the respiratory portfolio of Takeda Pharmaceutical – namely Alvesco and Omnaris – for US$575 million A day later, the company announced it had taken a 55% majority stake in Acerta for US$4 billion; the transaction included commercial rights to Acerta&#x27;s irreversible oral Bruton&#x27;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, acalabrutinib (ACP-196), which under development at that time. In 2015, AstraZenica was the eighth-largest drug company in the world based on sales revenue.

====2017====
In July 2017, the company&#x27;s CEO Pascal Soriot said that Brexit would not affect its commitment to its current plans in the United Kingdom. However, it had slowed decision making for new investment projects waiting for a post-Brexit regulatory regime to settle down. Two months later, the firm&#x27;s chairman Leif Johansson planned in taking the &quot;first steps&quot; in moving its research and manufacturing operations away from the United Kingdom, if there is a hard Brexit. Soon after, executive vice president Pam Cheng stated that AstraZeneca had ignited startup of duplicate QA testing facility in Sweden and has initiated hiring in Sweden.

In 2017, it was the eleventh largest drug company in the world based on sales and ranked seventh based on R&amp;D investment.

====2018====
In February 2018, AstraZeneca announced it was spinning off six early-stage experimental drugs into a new biotechnology company, known as Viela Bio, valued at US$250 million.

On 6 December 2018, AstraZeneca purchased nearly 8% of the American pharmaceutical business, Moderna.

====2019====
In March 2019, AstraZeneca announced it will pay up to US$6.9 billion to work with Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd on an experimental treatment for breast cancer. AstraZeneca plans to use some of the proceeds of a US$3.5 billion share issue to fund the deal. The deal on the drug known as trastuzumab deruxtecan sent shares in Japan&#x27;s Daiichi soaring 16%.

In September 2019, the company announced that it would cease drug production at its German headquarters in Wedel, leading to the loss of 175 jobs by the end of 2021.

In October 2019, AstraZeneca announced it would sell the global commercial rights for its drug to treat acid reflux to German pharmaceutical company Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH for as much as US$276 million.

====2020====
In February 2020, AstraZeneca agreed to sublicense its global rights (except Europe, Canada and Israel) to the drug Movantik, to Redhill Biopharma.

In June 2020, AstraZeneca made a preliminary approach to Gilead Sciences about a potential merger, worth almost US$240 billion. However, these plans were subsequently dropped because it would have distracted the company from its own pipeline and ongoing COVID-19 vaccine efforts.

In July 2020, the business entered into its second collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, centred around the development of DS-1062, an antibody drug conjugate. The deal could potentially be worth up to US$6 billion for Daiichi.

In September 2020, AstraZeneca acquired the preclinical oral PCSK9 inhibitor program from Dogma Therapeutics.

On 27 December 2020, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said that they have “figured out the winning formula” with their two-dose system with the Oxford University’s COVID-19 vaccine. Three days later, the United Kingdom approved the emergency use of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.

====2021====
In July 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Alexion Pharmaceuticals. In October 2021, the company, through Alexion, acquired Caelum Biosciences and its monoclonal treatment (CAEL-101) for light chain (AL) amyloidosis for up to $500 million.

====2022====
In July 2002, the company announced it would acquire TeneoTwo for up to $1.3 billion, increasing its blood cancer drug offering. In October 2022, it was announced that it would acquire LogicBio Therapeutics, which was active in clinical-stage genomic medicine.

In November 2022, it was announced AstraZeneca had acquired the Amsterdam-headquartered clinical-stage biotechnology company, Neogene Therapeutics.

====2023====
In January, AstraZeneca announced it would acquire CinCor Pharma for $1.8 billion.

In November 2023, AstraZeneca launched a new global health tech business, Evinova, that focused on provide global services to CROs and pharma companies to design, run and monitor clinical trials.

In December 2023, AstraZeneca announced that it would acquire an RSV vaccine developer, Icosavax for $1.1 billion. Later that month, AstraZeneca agreed to acquire clinical-stage biopharmaceutical developer of cell therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases, Gracell Biotechnologies, in a deal valued at up to $1.2 billion. Both the acquisitions were completed in February 2024.

====2024====
In March 2024, AstraZeneca announced it would acquire Amolyt Pharma in exchange for $1.05 billion. That same month, the firm also announced the acquisition of Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc for $2 billion in cash.

In July 2024, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) blocked the National Health Service (NHS) from providing Enhertu, an innovative treatment for advanced HER2-low breast cancer, due to AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo not offering a low enough price. Nice&#x27;s decision, the first rejection of a breast cancer treatment in six years, highlighted the financial challenges of funding complex medicines, with Enhertu costing £117,857 per treatment course. Despite approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, Nice&#x27;s non-recommendation meant the drug could only be available privately or under separate funding in Scotland. Clinical trials showed Enhertu extended patients&#x27; lives by five months compared to chemotherapy, but Nice and the companies could not agree on a new price.

In February 2024, the chief executive faced criticism from corporate governance experts and AstraZeneca investors regarding his excessive pay.

In December 2024, the company announced the appointment of Rene Haas and Birgit Conix to its board as non-executive directors. Both appointments will be effective from January 2025 and February 2025 respectively.

==Operations==
AstraZeneca develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceutical and biotechnology products to treat disorders in the oncology, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, infection, neuroscience, respiratory and inflammation areas.

AstraZeneca has its corporate headquarters in Cambridge, United Kingdom, and its main research and development (R&amp;D) centres are in Cambridge (UK), Gaithersburg (Maryland, US), Mölndal in Gothenburg (Sweden), and Warsaw (Poland).

=== Headquarters ===
AstraZeneca&#x27;s global headquarters are located in the Cambridge Biomedical Campus adjacent to Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom. This facility, known as the &quot;Discovery Centre&quot;, was designed by Swiss architecture firm Herzog &amp; de Meuron and officially opened by Prince Charles on the 23 November 2021. The building is designed to accommodate over 2,200 scientists across 16 laboratories covering approximately 19,000 square meters. built at a cost of approximately £1 billion.

=== Cambridge-Gothenburg flights ===
In 2015, AstraZeneca arranged for the establishment of a direct air route between Cambridge and Gothenburg, which began operation on 2 March 2015. The company reserved 20 of the 32 seats on each flight, with the remaining seats available to the public, which was operated SUN-AIR for British Airways. The service connects AstraZeneca’s global headquarters in Cambridge with its research facility in Gothenburg. The service operated four days per week and was intended to support collaboration between staff in the two locations, allowing same-day travel for meetings. The route ended as a scheduled public service in 2016 due to insufficient demand, but these flights continue for AstraZeneca employees as of 2024.

==Orphan drugs==

In April 2015, AstraZeneca&#x27;s drug tremelimumab was approved as an orphan drug for the treatment of mesothelioma in the United States. In February 2016, AstraZeneca announced that a clinical trial of tremelimumab as a treatment for mesothelioma failed to meet its primary endpoint.

==Senior management==
As of 2008, David Brennan was paid US$1,574,144 for his role as chief executive officer.

On 26 April 2012, it was announced that Brennan was to retire in early June of that year. In August 2012, Pascal Soriot was named CEO of AstraZeneca.

It was also announced that Leif Johansson would succeed Louis Schweitzer as non-executive chairman on 1 June 2012, three months earlier than previously announced, and would become Chairman of the Nomination and Governance Committee after the 2012 Annual General Meeting.

The company&#x27;s non-executive Board directors are Philip Broadley, Euan Ashley, Michel Demaré, Deborah DiSanzo, Diana Layfield, Sheri McCoy, Tony Mok, Nazneen Rahman, Andreas Rummelt, and Marcus Wallenberg.

== Lobbying ==

=== Political lobbying ===
AstraZeneca is a member of the Personalized Medicine Coalition, a medical research advocacy group that lobbies on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry.

==Controversies==

===Seroquel===
In April 2010, AstraZeneca settled a &quot;qui tam&quot; lawsuit brought by Stefan P. Kruszewski for US$520 million to settle allegations that the company defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, and other government-funded health care programs in connection with its marketing and promotional practices for the blockbuster atypical antipsychotic, Seroquel. According to the settlement agreement, AstraZeneca targeted its illegal marketing of the anti-psychotic Seroquel towards doctors who do not typically treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, such as physicians who treat the elderly, primary care physicians, pediatric and adolescent physicians, and in long-term care facilities and prisons.

In March 2011, AstraZeneca settled a lawsuit in the United States totalling US$68.5 million to be divided up to 38 states.

===Nexium===
The company&#x27;s most commercially successful medication is esomeprazole (Nexium). The primary uses are treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease. When it is manufactured the result is a mixture of two mirror-imaged molecules, R and S. Two years before the omeprazole patent expired, AstraZeneca patented S-omeprazole in pure form, pointing out that since some people metabolise R-omeprazole slowly, pure S-omeprazole treatment would give higher dose efficiency and less variation between individuals. In March 2001, the company began to market Nexium, as it would a brand new drug.

The (R)-enantiomer of omeprazole is metabolized exclusively by the enzyme CYP2C19, which is expressed in very low amounts by 3% of the population. Treated with a normal dose of the enantiomeric mixture, these persons will experience blood levels five-times higher than those with normal CYP2C19 production. In contrast, esomeprazole is metabolized by both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, providing less-variable drug exposure. While omeprazole is approved only at doses of up to 20 mg for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, esomeprazole is approved for doses up to 40 mg.

In 2007, Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; and a lecturer in social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, said in &quot;Stern&quot;, a German-language weekly newsmagazine, that AstraZeneca&#x27;s scientists had misrepresented their research on the drug&#x27;s efficiency, saying: &quot;Instead of using presumably comparable doses [of each drug], the company&#x27;s scientists used Nexium in higher dosages. They compared 20 and 40 mg Nexium with 20 mg Prilosec. With the cards having been marked in that way, Nexium looked like an improvement – which however was only small and shown in only two of the three studies.&quot;

===Bildman fraud, sexual harassment and faithless servant clawback===
On 4 February 1998, Astra USA sued Lars Bildman, its former president and chief executive officer, seeking US$15 million for defrauding the company. The sum included US$2.3 million in company funds he allegedly used to fix up three of his homes, plus money the company paid as the result of the EEOC investigation. Astra&#x27;s lawsuit alleged Bildman sexually harassed and intimidated employees, used company funds for yachts and sex workers, destroyed documents and records, and concocted: &quot;tales of conspiracy involving ex-KGB agents and competitors. This was in a last-ditch effort to distract attention from the real wrongdoer, Bildman himself.&quot; Bildman had already pleaded guilty in US District Court for failing to report more than US$1 million in income on his tax returns. In addition, several female co-workers filed personal sexual-harassment lawsuits against Bildman. In April 1998, Bildman was sentenced to 21 months in prison three months after he pled guilty to filing false Federal tax returns.

In February 1998, AstraZenaca&#x27;s U.S. affiliate Astra U.S.A. agreed to a $10 million settlement after an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation which started in May 1996 found that sexual harassment against female employees. 120 former female employees of Astra were interviewed during the inquiry, with about 80 of them being identified as able to file claims. Astra U.S.A. also issued a statement of apology for the hostile work environment.

In &quot;Astra USA v. Bildman&quot;, 914 N.E.2d 36 (Mass. 2009), applying New York&#x27;s faithless servant doctrine, the court held that a company&#x27;s employee who had engaged in financial misdeeds and sexual harassment must &quot;forfeit all of his salary and bonuses for the period of disloyalty&quot;. The court held that this was the case even if the employee &quot;otherwise performed valuable services&quot;, and that the employee was not entitled to recover restitution for the value of those other services. The decision attracted a good deal of attention by legal commentators.

===CAFÉ study===
In 2004, University of Minnesota research participant Dan Markingson took his own life while enrolled in an industry-sponsored pharmaceutical trial comparing three FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics: Seroquel (quetiapine), Zyprexa (olanzapine), and Risperdal (risperidone). University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. A 2005 FDA investigation cleared the university. Nonetheless, controversy around the case has continued. A &quot;Mother Jones&quot; article resulted in a group of university faculty members sending a public letter to the university Board of Regents urging an external investigation into Markingson&#x27;s death.

===Transfer mispricing===
In February 2010, AstraZeneca agreed to pay £505 million to settle a UK tax dispute related to transfer mispricing.

=== Conflicting commitments to the UK and the EU over COVID-19 vaccines ===

In August 2020, AstraZeneca made an advance purchase agreement with the European Commission and the EU member states for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines:
:&quot;13.1. AstraZeneca represents, warrants and covenants to the Commission and the Participating Member States that: [...] (e) it is not under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any Person or third party in respect of the Initial Europe Doses or that conflicts with or is inconsistent in any material respect with the terms of this Agreement or would impede the complete fulfilment of its obligation under this Agreement;&quot;

However, the UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, declared in March 2021 that the United Kingdom had been given &quot;exclusivity&quot; and that the EU&#x27;s treaty was &quot;inferior&quot;. After placing the order for AstraZeneca&#x27;s vaccine, the European Commission mistakenly assumed that it had enough vaccines and initially ordered only 200 million doses from Pfizer–BioNTech when the manufacturers offered 500 million doses to the EU in November 2020.

However, the contract that AstraZeneca reached with the UK was very similar to that it reached with the EU, and it also contained the phrase &quot;best reasonable efforts&quot;; the UK contract was signed on 28 August 2020, a day after the contract with the EU. The key difference seems to be that AstraZeneca entered into a preliminary agreement with the U.K. back in May 2020 which arranged for &quot;the development of a dedicated supply chain for the U.K.&quot; The failure to produce the vaccine in the anticipated quantities contributed to the low vaccination rates of vulnerable populations of the European Union at the beginning of the outbreak of more virulent variants of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2021.

=== Operations in China and investigation===
AstraZeneca&#x27;s reputation in China was tarnished when its Chinese subsidiary did not quickly donate to relief efforts after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Typically, donations for disaster relief in China are made through funds established through the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs and its subordinate organization, the Red Cross Society of China. AstraZeneca had a corporate rule prohibiting foreign subsidiaries from making donations to local governments, and the company construed this rule as prohibiting donations for Sichuan earthquake relief efforts. AstraZeneca&#x27;s Chinese subsidiary suffered a major backlash for its failure to donate. Corporate approval was eventually given for the Chinese subsidiary to donate, but only after a long delay.

During the early 2020s, AstraZeneca expanded its R&amp;D pipeline within China, increasing its investment in the country; the firm also signed licensing agreements with nine separate biotech firms in China that have been collectively valued at $6.5 billion.

In May 2023, AstraZeneca&#x27;s China president, Leon Wang, stated that the company aims to be a &quot;patriotic&quot; company in China that &quot;loves the Communist Party.&quot; On 30 October 2024, AstraZeneca revealed that Wang was under investigation by Chinese authorities and had been detained. The China business is now being run by Michael Lai, the general manager.

In November 2024, it was announced that Chinese officials had widened their investigation under a national anti-corruption campaign targeting healthcare. Among the allegations, former AstraZeneca employees are accused of falsifying genetic tests to secure reimbursement for the company’s lung cancer drug, Tagrisso. Several current and former company executives are also being investigated for potentially breaching data privacy laws and for the suspected illegal importation of certain cancer drugs – likely including Enhertu, Imfinzi and Imjudo – from Hong Kong.

=== Operations in Russia ===
Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, AstraZeneca faced criticism for maintaining its operations and continuing certain clinical trials in Russia, despite promising to halt new investments in the country. While several international pharmaceutical companies announced suspensions of new clinical studies in Russia after the conflict began, AstraZeneca moved forward with a study for a new COVID-19 prevention drug, essential for its registration in Russia.

<text>Two major bombings took place in residential compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on 12 May 2003, 39 people were killed, and over 160 wounded (mostly Westerners) when bombs went off at three compounds in Riyadh—Dorrat Al Jadawel, Al Hamra Oasis Village, and the Vinnell Corporation Compound. On 8 November, a bomb was detonated outside the Al-Mohaya housing compound west of Riyadh, killing at least 17 people and wounding 122, mostly Arab foreigners.

The bombings have been attributed to Islamic extremists as part of a campaign against Westerners and Westernization in Saudi Arabia. They are thought to have been sparked by the stationing of US troops in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq.

==Prelude==
A smaller campaign of insurgency in Saudi Arabia had begun in November 2000 when car bombings were carried out targeting and killing individual expatriates in Riyadh and other cities. As early as February 2003, the US State Department issued travel warnings that Westerners could be targeted by terrorists. The warnings followed an explosion at a private residence where weapons, explosives, cash, and false documents were subsequently discovered. In early May 2003, the US State Department warned that terrorists were in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government also warned of this and issued an alert for 19 men believed to be members of Al-Qaeda planning attacks.

==May attack==
Late on 12 May, several vehicles manned by heavily armed assault teams arrived at three Riyadh compounds: The Dorrat Al Jadawel, a compound owned by the London-based MBI International and Partners subsidiary Jadawel International, the Al Hamra Oasis Village, and the Vinnell Corporation Compound, occupied by a Virginia-based defense contractor that was training the Saudi National Guard. All contained large numbers of Americans, Westerners, and non-Saudi Arabs.

Around 11:15 pm, multiple gunmen infiltrated the Al Hamra Oasis Village, a site inhabited mainly by Westerners. They killed the guards at the gate and proceeded to open fire at residents, killing Westerners, non-Saudi Arabs, and Saudis and the assailants then detonated a car bomb. The next attack was at the Jadawel compound, though the assailants failed to gain access to the compound due to the prominent level of security. There was a shootout between security personnel and terrorists on approach to the front gates. The terrorists then detonated a two-ton truck bomb outside the area killing themselves, two security guards and injuring many others.

The final target was the Vinnell compound. The terrorists approached the gate in a sedan, with a pickup truck carrying the explosives following. Those in the sedan shot the Saudi soldiers guarding the gate and then opened the gate for the pickup truck. The truck was driven to the front of one of the residential high rises on the compound and detonated. At the time, many of the Vinnell employees were away from the compound, supporting an exercise for the National Guard. Seven Americans were killed or died of injuries the night of the attack, along with two Filipino employees. An eighth American died in hospital several days later. Some of the terrorists died when the truck bomb was detonated, and others escaped by climbing over the compound wall.

===Possibility of inside actors===
According to American intelligence sources, the bomber&#x27;s operation &quot;depended on a significant level of &#x27;insider&#x27; knowledge of the compounds.&quot; According to one American military official quoted by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, it took the bombers 
(...) 30 seconds to a minute to get from the gate to the housing block. They had to know where the switches were to operate the gates after attacking the guards. They then drove at breakneck speed with a bomb weighing nearly 200 kilograms to the most intensely populated location in the complex and blew it up. &quot;Several bombers&quot; were wearing uniforms of the National Guard to help them get into the three bombed complexes. The intelligence officials believe that al-Qaeda has infiltrated even the elite National Guard, which is involved in compound security.

===Reaction===
In the immediate aftermath of the May bombing, a large number of Western expatriates left Saudi Arabia. Airlines reported a &quot;flood of bookings for flights from Saudi Arabia to Britain and America&quot;. There were also bomb scares and an evacuation of one compound near those attacked and at the landmark Faisaliya Tower.

The attacks were denounced by then-US President George W. Bush as &quot;ruthless murder&quot; and by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah as the work of &quot;monsters.&quot; Abdullah vowed to destroy the terrorist group that ordered them, and the Saudi government began a harsh crackdown on the insurgency, arresting more than 600 terrorist suspects and seizing bomb-making materials, bomb belts, and thousands of weapons.

On 7 June 2003, an official Saudi statement identified twelve men as the perpetrators of this attack. According to that statement, the identification was based on DNA found at the scene. The names were Al-Qaeda member Khaled Muhammad bin Muslim Al-Arawi Al-Juhani, Muhammed Othman Abdullah Al-Walidi Al-Shehri, Hani Saeed Ahmad Al Abdul-Karim Al-Ghamdi, Jubran Ali Ahmad Hakami Khabrani, Khaled bin Ibrahim Mahmoud, Mehmas bin Muhammed Mehmas Al-Hawashleh Al-Dosari, Muhammed bin Shadhaf Ali Al-Mahzoum Al-Shehri, Hazem Muhammed Saeed Kashmiri, Majed Abdullah Sa&#x27;ad bin Okail, Bandar bin Abdul-Rahman Menawer Al-Rahimi Al-Mutairi, Abdul-Karim Muhammed Jubran Yazji, and Abdullah Farres bin Jufain Al-Rahimi Al-Mutairi.

Abdul Rahman Jabarah was killed in a gunfight with Saudi security forces, as was Zubayr Al-Rimi. Both men were believed to have had involvement in the attack.

Saif al-Adel and Saad bin Laden were implicated in the attacks. According to Seth G. Jones, the bombings were planned by al Qaeda in Iran, with apparent Iranian complicity. In May 2003, then-State Department official Ryan Crocker provided information on the upcoming attack to Iranian officials, who apparently took no action. However, according to an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, al-Adel and Saad were being held prisoner in Iran when the attacks took place. Saad was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in 2009.

===Casualties===
In the compound bombings, reportedly at least 27 people died from several different countries:

In addition, twelve suicide bombers died, bringing the entire toll from the attacks to 39. More than 160 other people were injured, including more than two dozen Americans.

In October 2003, as-Sahab released the videotaped wills of the bombers Abu Umar al-Ta&#x27;ifi (also known as Hamza al-Ansari), Muhammad bin Shazzaf al-Shahri (also known as Abu Tareq al-Aswad) and Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab al-Maqit, recorded two weeks before the attacks.

==November attack==
On 8 November, a suicide truck bomb detonated outside the Al-Mohaya housing compound in Laban Valley, West of Riyadh, killing at least 17 people and wounding 122, among them 36 children. The majority of the casualties were foreigners, many of them workers from countries such as Egypt and Lebanon. Other injured victims were people from India, Bangladesh, Philippines, and Eritrea. (The US State Department had warned of further attacks in the Kingdom on the day of the attack.)

===Questions about inside actors===
According to the Saudi Press Agency, suicide bombers posing as guards drove into the compound in a vehicle that &quot;looked like a police car&quot;, and after an exchange of gunfire with security forces blew themselves up—the compound allegedly chosen by them because those occupied by Western expatriates were too well guarded. However, journalist John R. Bradley noted that none of the suicide bombers were identified by the government and that despite official reports of gunfire before the bombing—and thus presumably casualties among security forces—there were no televised visits by Interior Minister Prince Naif to homes of members of those forces, as is customary when members are killed in an attack.

Bradley reports that in an alternative version of the bombing—provided to him by Saudi opposition figures with sources among disgruntled members of the security forces and government—the police car was &quot;in fact ... a car belonging to the Saudi special security forces,&quot; and that the bomb was not detonated in suicide but by remote control, its detonators escaping unharmed. Thus, attackers dressed as policemen, driving a special security forces car, taking care not to kill any of those defending the compound, and apparently not themselves being fired upon with any degree of accuracy [meant that] There could not be greater evidence, if even only half of that proved true, that Al-Qaeda had infiltrated Saudi Arabia&#x27;s military and security forces, including those entrusted with the protection of residential compounds.
According to Bradley, surviving residents of the compound stated that three months before the bombing Saudi religious police accompanied by regular Saudi police, had visited them—a rare intrusion into the &quot;refuge from Saudi morality that the compounds are supposed to provide&quot;. The police had warned the residents that their &quot;Westernized lifestyle&quot; was &quot;under scrutiny&quot;. It was an &quot;open secret&quot;, according to Bradley, that many of the religious police supported Osama bin Laden.

<doc id="441881" wikidata="Q216951" url="?curid=441881" title="24th Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 24th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army that was inactivated in October 1996. Formed during World War II from the disbanding Hawaiian Division, the division saw action throughout the Pacific theater, first fighting in New Guinea before landing on the Philippine islands of Leyte and Luzon, driving Japanese forces from them. Following the end of the war, the division participated in occupation duties in Japan, and was the first division to respond at the outbreak of the Korean War. For the first 18 months of the war, the division was heavily engaged on the front lines with North Korean and Chinese forces, suffering over 10,000 casualties. It was withdrawn from the front lines to the reserve force for the remainder of the war after the second battle for Wonju, but returned to Korea for patrol duty at the end of major combat operations.

After its deployment in the Korean War, the division was active in Europe and the United States during the Cold War. It was based at Fort Stewart, Georgia and later reactivated at Fort Riley, Kansas. It did not see combat again until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced the Iraqi military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated as part of the post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.

==History==
===Hawaiian Division===

The 24th Infantry Division traces its lineage to Army units activated in Hawaii. It was activated under the Square Division Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&amp;E) on 1 March 1921 as the Hawaiian Division at Schofield Barracks, Oahu. The division insignia is based on the taro leaf, emblematic of Hawaii. The 21st Infantry Regiment and the 22nd Infantry Regiment was assigned to the Division, both of which had been assigned to the US 11th Infantry Division prior to 1921.

The entire Hawaiian Division was concentrated at a single location during the next few years, allowing it to conduct more effective combined arms training. It was also manned at higher personnel levels than other divisions, and its field artillery was the first to be motorized.

Between August and September 1941, the Hawaiian Division&#x27;s assets were reorganized to form two divisions under the new Triangular Division TO&amp;E. Its brigade headquarters were disbanded and the 27th and 35th Infantry Regiments were assigned to the new 25th Infantry Division. Hawaiian Division headquarters was redesignated as Headquarters, 24th Infantry Division on 1 October 1941. The 24th Infantry Division also received the Hawaiian Division&#x27;s Shoulder Sleeve Insignia, which was approved in 1921.

The division was then centered around three infantry regiments: the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 21st Infantry Regiment from the old Hawaiian Division, and the 299th Infantry Regiment from the Hawaii National Guard. In July 1942, the 299th Infantry was inactivated after its ranks were depleted by the transfer of many &quot;Nisei&quot; (second-generation Japanese-Americans) to form the 100th Infantry Battalion, and the 25th Infantry Division&#x27;s 298th Infantry Regiment was reassigned to the 24th. Also part of the division were the 13th Field Artillery Battalion, the 52nd Field Artillery Battalion, the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, the 11th Field Artillery Battalion, the 24th Signal Company, the 724th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company, the 24th Quartermaster Company, the 24th Reconnaissance Troop, the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion, the 24th Medical Battalion, and the 24th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment.

===World War II===
The 24th Infantry Division was among the first US Army divisions to see combat in World War II and among the last to stop fighting. The division was on Oahu, with its headquarters at Schofield Barracks, when the Japanese launched their Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the unit suffered some casualties during the attack. Among these casualties were Sgt. Paul J. Fadon (killed in a truck 10 miles north of Schofield Barracks), Pvt. Walter R. French, Pfc. Conrad Kujawa, Pvt. Torao Migita (killed by friendly fire in downtown Honolulu), and Corporal Theodore J. Lewis (who became the 24th Infantry Division&#x27;s first soldier killed during WWII). The division was then charged with the defense of northern Oahu, where it built an elaborate system of coastal defenses throughout 1942. In July 1942, the 299th Infantry Regiment was replaced by the 298th Infantry Regiment. One year later, this regiment was replaced by the 34th Infantry Regiment from the Hawaiian Department Reserve. The 34th Infantry remained with the 24th Infantry Division until the end of the war. As an active component unit, the 34th was easier to deploy than the reserve component units, which were less trained.

====Hollandia====
In May 1943, the 24th Infantry Division was alerted for movement to Australia, and it completed the move to Camp Caves, near Rockhampton, on the eastern coast of Australia by 19 September 1943. Once deployed, it began intensive combat training. After training, the division moved to Goodenough Island on 31 January 1944, to prepare for Operation Reckless, the amphibious capture of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea (now Jayapura, Papua province, Indonesia).

The 24th landed at Tanahmerah Bay on 22 April 1944 and seized the important Hollandia Airdrome despite torrential rain and marshy terrain. Shortly after the Hollandia landing, the division&#x27;s 34th Infantry Regiment moved to Biak to reinforce the 41st Infantry Division. The regiment captured Sorido and Borokoe airdromes before returning to the division on Hollandia in July. The 41st and 24th divisions isolated 40,000 Japanese forces south of the landings. Despite resistance from the isolated Japanese forces in the area, the 24th Infantry Division advanced rapidly through the region. In two months, the 24th Division crossed the entirety of New Guinea.
====Leyte====

After occupation duty in the Hollandia area, the 24th Division was assigned to X Corps of the Sixth United States Army in preparation for the invasion of the Philippines. On 20 October 1944, the division was paired with the 1st Cavalry Division within X Corps, and the two divisions made an assault landing at Leyte, initially encountering only light resistance. Following a defeat at sea on 26 October, the Japanese launched a large, uncoordinated counteroffensive against the Sixth Army. The 24th Division drove up the Leyte Valley, advanced to Jaro and captured Breakneck Ridge on 12 November 1944, in heavy fighting.

While final clearing operations continued on Leyte, the 24th Division&#x27;s 19th Infantry Regiment moved to Mindoro Island as part of the Western Visayan Task Force and landed in the San Jose area on 15 December 1944. There, it secured airfields and a patrol base for operations on Luzon. Elements of the 24th Infantry Division effected a landing on Marinduque Island. Other elements supported the 11th Airborne Division drive from Nasugbu to Manila.

====Luzon====
The 24th Division was among the 200,000 men of the Sixth Army which moved to recapture Luzon from the Japanese 14th Area Army, which fought delaying actions on the island. The division&#x27;s 34th Infantry Regiment landed at San Antonio, Zambales on 29 January 1945 and ran into a furious battle on Zig Zag Pass, where it suffered heavy casualties. On 16 February 1945 the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry took part in the amphibious landing on Corregidor and fought the Japanese on the well-defended island. The rest of the division landed at Sablayan, Mindoro on 19 February, cleared the remainder of the island and engaged in numerous mopping up actions during the following month. These operations were complete by 18 March, and the division moved south to attack through Basilan. the division landed at Mindanao on 17 April 1945 and cut across the island to Digos until 27 April, stormed into Davao on 3 May, and cleared Libby airdrome on 13 May. Although the campaign officially closed on 30 June, the division continued to clear up Japanese resistance during July and August 1945. The 24th Infantry Division and the Philippine Commonwealth military patrolled the region until the official surrender of Japan ended the war. On 15 October 1945 the division left Mindanao for occupation duty on mainland Japan.
Four soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor during their service with the 24th Infantry Division during World War II. They were James H. Diamond, Charles E. Mower, Harold H. Moon Jr., and Francis B. Wai. Members of the 24th Infantry Division also won 15 Distinguished Service Crosses, two Distinguished Service Medals, 625 Silver Star Medals, 38 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 2,197 Bronze Star Medals, and 50 Air Medals. The division itself was awarded eight Distinguished Unit Citations for participation in the campaign.

====Occupation of Japan====
After the end of the war, the division remained on mainland Japan. It occupied Kyūshū from 1945 until 1950. During this time, the US Army shrank. At the end of World War II it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force. It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan. The others were the 1st Cavalry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 25th Infantry Division, all under control of the Eighth United States Army. The 24th Division retained the 19th, 21st, and 34th regiments, but the formations were undermanned and ill-equipped due to the post-war drawdown and reduction in military spending.

===Korean War===
On 25 June 1950, 10 divisions of the North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) launched an attack into the Republic of Korea in the south. The North Koreans overwhelmed the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and advanced south, preparing to conquer the entire nation. The UN ordered an intervention to prevent the conquest of South Korea. U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground forces into South Korea. The 24th Infantry Division was closest to Korea, and it was the first US division to respond. The 24th Division&#x27;s first mission was to &quot;take the initial shock&quot; of the North Korean assault, then try to slow its advance until more US divisions could arrive.

====Task Force Smith====

Five days later, on 30 June, a 406-man infantry force from 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, supported by a 134-man artillery battery (also from the 24th Infantry Division) was sent into South Korea. The force, nicknamed Task Force Smith for its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bradford Smith, was lightly armed and ordered to delay the advance of KPA forces while the rest of the 24th Infantry Division moved into South Korea. On 4 July, the task force set up in the hills north of Osan and prepared to block advancing KPA forces. The next day, they spotted an incoming column of troops from the KPA 105th Armored Division. The ensuing battle was a rout, as the Task Force&#x27;s obsolescent anti-tank weapons and understrength units were no match for the KPA&#x27;s T-34 tanks and full-strength formations. Within a few hours, the first battle between American and North Korean forces was lost. Task Force Smith suffered 20 killed and 130 wounded in action. Dozens of US soldiers were captured, and when US forces retook the area, some of the prisoners were discovered to have been executed. According to recently declassified documents the troops were captured and taken to Pyongyang where they are thought to have been murdered about three months later.

Approximately 30 percent of Task Force Smith became casualties in the Battle of Osan. The task force delayed the KPA advance for only seven hours.

====Pusan Perimeter====
The rest of the 24th Infantry Division arrived in South Korea, through the port of Pusan, followed by elements of the 1st Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division from the Eighth Army. As more soldiers arrived, the 24th Infantry Division was placed under the command of I Corps, Eighth Army. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and pushed south by the KPA&#x27;s superior numbers and equipment. 24th Infantry Division soldiers were pushed south at and around Chochiwon, Chonan, Pyongtaek, Hadong and Yechon. The division&#x27;s 19th and 34th Regiments engaged the KPA 3rd and the 4th Infantry Divisions at the Kum River between 13 and 16 July and suffered 650 casualties of the 3,401 men committed there. On 19 and 20 July, the KPA divisions attacked the 24th Infantry Division&#x27;s headquarters in Taejon and overran it in the Battle of Taejon. In the ensuing battle, 922 men of the 24th Infantry Division were killed and 228 were wounded of 3,933 committed there. Many soldiers were missing in action, including the division commander, Major General William F. Dean, who was captured and later awarded the Medal of Honor. On 1 August, the 24th Division&#x27;s 19th Infantry Regiment engaged KPA forces and was again forced back, losing 90 killed. KPA officers at the battle claimed that some US soldiers were &quot;too frightened to fight.&quot; However, the 24th Infantry Division managed to delay the advancing North Koreans for two days, long enough for significant numbers of UN forces to arrive in Pusan and begin establishing defenses further south. By the time the 24th Infantry Division retreated and reformed, the 1st Cavalry Division was in place behind it. The division suffered over 3,600 casualties in the 17 days it fought alone against the KPA 3rd and 4th Divisions.
By 4 August, a perimeter was established around Pusan on the hills to the north of the city and the Naktong River to the west. The Eighth Army, including the 24th Infantry Division, was cornered by the surrounding KPA. UN forces were now concentrated, the 24th Division was at Naktong, with the 25th Infantry Division to the south, and the 1st Cavalry Division and ROK forces to the north. The 24th Division was also reinforced by the 2nd Infantry Division, newly arrived in the theater. The 24th was quickly sent to block the KPA 6th Infantry Division, which attempted to attack the UN forces from the southwest. On 8 August, the KPA 4th Infantry Division crossed the river and attempted to penetrate the perimeter. After 10 days of fighting, the 24th Infantry Division counterattacked and forced the North Koreans back across the river. By late August 1950, only 184 of the 34th Regiment&#x27;s original 1,898 men remained. The regiment was dissolved and was replaced within the 24th by the 5th Regimental Combat Team. The 34th Regiment&#x27;s survivors were added to the ranks of the 19th and 21st Regiments in an effort to bring them up to strength and the 5th Infantry remained with the 24th Division until the division withdrew from Korea. Elements of the 24th Infantry Division were moved into reserve on 23 August and replaced by the 2nd Infantry Division. A second, larger KPA attack occurred between 31 August and 19 September, but the 2nd, 24th, and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division beat them back across the river again.

At the same time, X Corps, with the 7th Infantry Division and 1st Marine Division, attacked Inchon, striking the KPA from the rear. The attack routed the surprised North Koreans, and starting on 16 September, the Eighth Army broke out of the Pusan Perimeter and then began a general counteroffensive northwards. The 24th Infantry Division advanced to Songju, then to Seoul. The Army advanced north along the west coast of Korea through October. By mid-October, the KPA had been almost completely destroyed, and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance into North Korea as quickly as possible to end the war. The 24th Infantry Division, with the ROK 1st Infantry Division, moved to the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army, and moved north along Korea&#x27;s west coast. The 24th Division then moved north to Chongju. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October. On 1 November, the division&#x27;s 21st Infantry captured Chonggodo, from the Yalu River and Korea&#x27;s border with China. Units of the Eighth Army and X Corps spread out as they attempted to reach the Yalu and complete the conquest of North Korea as quickly as possible.

====Chinese intervention====
The UN forces renewed their offensive on 24 November before being stopped by the PVA Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November. The 24th Infantry Division, on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, was hit by soldiers from the PVA 50th and 66th Field Armies. Amid heavy casualties, the Eighth Army retreated from North Korea to the Imjin River, south of the 38th Parallel, having been destabilised by the overwhelming PVA force.

On 1 January 1951, 500,000 PVA troops attacked the Eighth Army&#x27;s line at the Imjin River, forcing it back and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The 24th Infantry Division was then reassigned to IX Corps to replace the 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, which had been placed in reserve due to heavy losses. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.

====Stalemate====
General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered I, IX and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive on the Chinese (Operation Thunderbolt) quickly thereafter. The 24th Division, as part of IX Corps, advanced along the center of the peninsula to take Chipyong-ni. The corps ran into heavy resistance and fought for the region until February. Between February and March 1951, the 24th Infantry Division participated in Operation Killer, pushing PVA forces north of the Han River. This operation was followed by Operation Ripper, which recaptured Seoul in March. After this, Operation Rugged and Operation Dauntless in April saw the division advance north of the 38th Parallel and reestablish itself along previously established lines of defense, code named Kansas and Utah, respectively.

In late April, the PVA launched a major counterattack. Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions were able to hold their ground against the PVA 9th Army Corps, the ROK 6th Infantry Division, to the east, was destroyed by the PVA 13th Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the 24th and 25th Divisions. The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April. The UN forces&#x27; line was moved back to Seoul but managed to hold. In May-June the UN launched another counteroffensive erasing most of the PVA gains. In September, the UN forces launched another counteroffensive with the 24th Infantry Division at the center of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the ROK 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the PVA 20th and 27th Armies. In November, the PVA attempted to counter this attack but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations.

In January 1952, the 24th Infantry Division, which suffered over 10,000 casualties in 18 months of fighting, was redesignated as the Far East Theater reserve and pulled out of Korea. It returned to Japan to rebuild. The 34th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted, and the division returned to full strength during the next year, having been replaced in Korea by the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. In July 1953, the division returned to Korea to restore order at Geoje prisoner of war camp. It arrived two weeks before the end of the war.

During the war, 10 soldiers of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor. They were William F. Dean, George D. Libby, Melvin O. Handrich, Mitchell Red Cloud Jr., Carl H. Dodd, Nelson V. Brittin, Ray E. Duke, Stanley T. Adams, Mack A. Jordan, and Woodrow W. Keeble. Keeble&#x27;s medal was awarded on 3 March 2008, 26 years after his death. The 24th Infantry Division suffered 3,735 killed and 7,395 wounded during the Korean War. It remained on front-line duty after the armistice until October 1957, patrolling the 38th parallel in the event that combat would resume. The division then returned to Japan and remained there for a short time.

===Cold War===
On 1 July 1958 the division was relocated to Augsburg, West Germany, replacing the 11th Airborne Division in a reflagging ceremony. The 24th was organized under the Pentomic Division TO&amp;E, in which its combat forces were organized into five oversized battalions (called &quot;battle groups&quot;) with no intermediate brigade or regimental headquarters. Although considered an infantry division, the 24th included two airborne battle groups for several months. The 1st Airborne Battle Group, 503rd Infantry left the division for reassignment to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg on 7 January 1959 and the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry departed on 8 February 1959, also for the 82nd.

On 13 July, less than 2 weeks after the reorganization, King Faisal II of Iraq was assassinated in a coup orchestrated by pro-Egyptian officers. The Christian president of Lebanon, pressured by Muslims to join Egypt and Syria in the Gamal Abdel Nasser-led United Arab Republic, requested help from the Eisenhower administration during the 1958 Lebanon crisis.

On the night of 15 July, U.S. Marines from the Sixth Fleet landed at Beirut and secured the Beirut airport. The following day, the 24th Division&#x27;s 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry deployed to Turkey and flew to Beirut on 19 July. They were joined by a medium tank battalion and support units, which assisted the Marines in forming a security cordon around the city. The force stayed until late October, providing security, making shows of force, including parachute jumps, and training the Lebanese Army. When factions of the Lebanese government worked out a political settlement, they left. The 24th Division&#x27;s 1/187th lost one soldier killed by a sniper.

The 24th came into international press focus in 1961 when its commanding general, Major General Edwin Walker, was removed from command for making &quot;derogatory remarks of a serious nature about certain prominent Americans ... which linked the persons and institutions with Communism and Communist influence&quot;. The inquiry was sparked by Walker&#x27;s &quot;Pro Blue&quot; program and accusations Walker and his Information Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Roberts, distributed John Birch Society literature as troop information in the 24th.

After the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, the Seventh Army began sending infantry units from the divisions in West Germany on a rotating basis to reinforce the Berlin Brigade. The 24th Division&#x27;s units participated in this action.

In January 1963, the 24th was reorganized as a mechanized infantry division under the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) TO&amp;E, which replaced the pentomic battle groups with conventional-sized battalions organized in three combined arms brigades. The 169th Infantry Brigade, previously assigned to the 85th Infantry Division was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 24th Infantry Division. The 85th Division&#x27;s 170th Infantry Brigade was redesignated the 2nd Brigade, 24th Infantry Division. The 190th Infantry Brigade, previously assigned to the 95th Infantry Division, became the division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade. In 1965, the 24th Infantry Division received its distinctive unit insignia.

The 24th remained in Germany, specifically Augsburg, Bavaria until September 1968, when it redeployed its 1st and 2nd Brigades to Fort Riley, Kansas, as part of Exercise Reforger while the division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade was maintained in Germany. As the US Army withdrew from Vietnam and reduced its forces, the 24th Infantry Division and its three brigades were inactivated on 15 April 1970 at Fort Riley.

In September 1975, the 24th Infantry Division was reactivated at Fort Stewart, Georgia, as part of the program to build a 16-division US Army force. Because the Regular Army could not field a full division at Fort Stewart, the 24th had the 48th Infantry Brigade of the Georgia Army National Guard assigned to it as a round-out unit in place of its 3rd Brigade. Targeted for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) role, the 24th Division was reorganized as a mechanized division in 1979.

Under then-Major General John Galvin, the division was earmarked to join the U.S. Army&#x27;s component of the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, the XVIII Airborne Corps. Galvin wrote years later that the &#x27;logistical problems [involved in Middle East deployments] were tougher than anything I had ever encountered in my time in seven different divisions.&#x27; (Galvin 2015, 267). &#x27;We went immediately to barcoding, minicomputers, and every innovation we could find to improve supply procedures and keep [the] division moving.&#x27; (Galvin, Fighting the Cold War, 2015, 267–8).
The 24th ID eventually reequipped with new M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, that formed the core of the U.S. Army&#x27;s heavily armored mechanized force for the 15 years that followed.

===Gulf War===
====Desert Shield====
When President George H.W. Bush decided to send troops to Saudi Arabia after the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the division, as part of the XVIII Airborne Corps, was one of the first formations deployed to the Middle East. It arrived in 10 large cargo ships of the Military Sealift Command. Advance elements of the 24th Division began arriving in Saudi Arabia on 17 August. Some controversy erupted when the division&#x27;s round-out formation, the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), of the Georgia National Guard, was not sent overseas. Army leaders decided that the use of National Guard forces was unnecessary, as they felt the active-duty force had sufficient troops. The 48th Brigade was replaced once the 24th Division was in Saudi Arabia with the regular Army&#x27;s 197th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized). The 24th Division was then assigned to XVIII Airborne Corps as the corps&#x27; heavy-armored division.

In the months that followed, the 24th Division played an important part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy firepower with its large number of armored vehicles, including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos that followed the rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and on the desert sand. The 24th remained in relatively stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.
Aviation units of the division included 2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry, and 1st Battalion, 24th Aviation Regiment.

====Desert Storm====


Operation Desert Storm began with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 17 January 1991. When the ground attack commenced on 24 February, the 24th Infantry Division formed the east flank of the corps with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. It blocked the Euphrates River valley to cut off Iraqi forces in Kuwait and little resistance. At this time, the 24th Division&#x27;s ranks swelled to over 25,000 troops in 34 battalions, commanding 94 helicopters, 241 M1 Abrams tanks, 221 M2 Bradley Armored fighting vehicles, and over 7,800 other vehicles. The 24th Infantry Division performed exceptionally well in the theater; it had been training in desert warfare for several years before the conflict. On 26 February, the 24th Division advanced through the valley and captured Iraqi airfields at the Battle for Jalibah Airfield and Tallil. At the airfields, it encountered entrenched resistance from the Iraqi 37th and 49th Infantry Divisions, as well as the 6th Nebuchadnezzar Mechanized Division of the Iraqi Republican Guard. Despite some of the most fierce resistance of the war, the 24th Infantry Division destroyed the Iraqi formations and captured the two airfields the next day. The 24th then moved east with VII Corps and engaged several Iraqi Republican Guard divisions. The 24th Infantry Division&#x27;s Task Force Tusker attacked entrenched Iraqi forces on 26 February 1991 to seize battle position 143, effectively severing the Iraqi Euphrates River Valley line of communication to the Kuwait Theater of operation and destroying the major combat elements of the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command&#x27;s elite 26th Commando Brigade.

On 2 March 1991 the 24th Infantry Division would participate in a controversial engagement against the Republican Guard Hammurabi Division. It would take place well after the ceasefire. It is known as the Battle of Rumaila. Iraqi Republican Guard forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to reach and cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a kill zone and then in the course of the next five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.
Nine American artillery battalions would fire thousands of rounds and rockets during this particular engagement. At least six Hammurabi Republican Guard battalions were destroyed.

The 1st Bn., 24th Aviation Reg destroyed 32 Iraqi tanks, 49 BMPs, 37 trucks, 8 Frog Missile launchers, numerous other assorted artillery pieces, anti-aircraft guns, and support vehicles.
This devastating aerial attack assured the destruction of the Republican Guard Forces Hammurabi Division and the remnants of several other infantry divisions. Four companies within 1st Battalion, 24th Aviation Regiment would be awarded Valorous Unit Award Citations.

General Barry McCaffrey reported the elimination of 247 tanks and armored fighting vehicles, 43 artillery pieces, and over 400 trucks. Approximately 3,000 Iraqi soldiers were captured. The battle was one-sided and Iraqi attempts to return fire proved to be almost completely ineffective, as during the engagement only one U.S. soldier was injured and two U.S. armored vehicles were lost (an M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle damaged by enemy fire and an M1 Abrams tank set on fire by a nearby explosion of an Iraqi truck). A hospital bus with medics and wounded Iraqi soldiers who had already surrendered to another American platoon was also destroyed by gunfire, which later troubled many U.S. soldiers. Surviving Iraqi soldiers were either taken prisoner, fled on foot or swam to safety.

After the Iraqi forces were defeated, the U.N. mandated that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf War. By the end of combat operations, the 24th Infantry Division advanced 260 miles and destroyed 360 tanks and other armored personnel carriers, 300 artillery pieces, 1,200 trucks, 25 aircraft, 19 missiles, and over 500 pieces of engineer equipment. The division took over 5,000 Iraqi prisoners of war while suffering only eight killed, 36 wounded, and five non-combat casualties.

After returning to the United States in spring 1991, the 24th was reorganized with two brigades at Fort Stewart and the 3rd Brigade reactivated at Fort Benning, Georgia, replacing the 197th Infantry Brigade. In fall 1994, Iraq again threatened the Kuwaiti border, and two brigades from the division returned to southwest Asia. As part of the Army&#x27;s reduction to a ten-division force, the 24th Infantry Division was inactivated on 15 February 1996 and reflagged to become the 3rd Infantry Division. Its three brigades were reflagged as 3rd Infantry Division brigades.

===Training command===
In the wake of the Cold War, the US Army considered new options for the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two active duty division headquarters were activated for training National Guard units; those of the 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate, so they could not be deployed as combat divisions. Instead, the headquarters units focused on full-time training.

On 5 June 1999 the 24th Infantry Division was reactivated, this time at Fort Riley, Kansas. From 1999 to 2006, the 24th Infantry Division consisted of a headquarters and three separate National Guard brigades; the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team at Clinton, North Carolina, the 218th Heavy Brigade Combat Team at Columbia, South Carolina, and the 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Macon, Georgia. The division headquarters was responsible for the Guard brigades should they be called to active duty in wartime. This never occurred, as each brigade deployed individually. The division&#x27;s final operations included preparing Fort Riley for the return of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed in Germany.

To expand upon the concept of Reserve component and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for reserve units&#x27; readiness and mobilization exercises. Division East activated at Fort Riley. This transformation was part of an overall restructuring of the US Army to streamline the organizations overseeing training. Division East took control of reserve units in states east of the Mississippi River, eliminating the need for the 24th Infantry Division headquarters. As such, the 24th Infantry Division was again inactivated on 1 August 2006 at Fort Riley.

===Inactivation===
Though it was inactivated, the division was initially identified as the third highest priority inactive division in the United States Army Center of Military History&#x27;s lineage scheme due to its numerous accolades and long history. All of the division&#x27;s flags and heraldic items were moved to the National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning, Georgia following its inactivation. Should the U.S. Army decide to activate more divisions in the future following the activation of the 7th Infantry Division in 2012, the center will most likely suggest the first new division be the 9th Infantry Division, the second be the 24th Infantry Division, the third be the 5th Infantry Division, and the fourth be the 2nd Armored Division.

==Honors==
The 24th Infantry Division was awarded five campaign streamers and one unit decoration in World War II, eight campaign streamers and three unit decorations in the Korean War, two campaign streamers for the Gulf War, and one unit award in peacetime, for a total of fifteen campaign streamers and five unit decorations in its operational history.

<text>The Biblioteca Ambrosiana is a historic library in Milan, Italy, also housing the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, the Ambrosian art gallery. Named after Ambrose, the patron saint of Milan, it was founded in 1609 by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, whose agents scoured Western Europe and even Greece and Syria for books and manuscripts. Some major acquisitions of complete libraries were the manuscripts of the Benedictine monastery of Bobbio (1606) and the library of the Paduan Vincenzo Pinelli, whose more than 800 manuscripts filled 70 cases when they were sent to Milan and included the famous &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Ilias Picta&quot;.

== Background ==
During his sojourns in Rome, 1585–95 and 1597–1601, Cardinal Borromeo envisioned developing a library in Milan as one open to scholars and that would serve as a bulwark of Catholic scholarship in the service of the Counter-Reformation against the treatises issuing from Protestant presses.

The library&#x27;s contents were assembled in the six preceding years by a team of purchasing agents, members of the Cardinal&#x27;s establishment or ecclesiastical &quot;hommes de confiance&quot;. These emissaries, who travelled over much of the Mediterranean, were kept under strict financial control from Milan and worked to a master plan devised by the Cardinal. In this scheme Greek manuscripts, of which there were more than a thousand, held the position of honour that had become normal since the Renaissance, but Oriental languages were given greater prominence than in earlier public collections. There was only one large block purchase; attempts to buy the library of Cardinal Ascanio Colonna in Rome and those of Giacomo Barocci and Pietro Bembo in Venice were unsuccessful, though Lucrezia Borgia&#x27;s love-letters presumably came from the last. Otherwise the books were acquired singly or in small groups. 

An important source of supply was the churches and monasteries of northern Italy to whom the Cardinal-Archbishop was clearly well placed to appeal . The most valuable codex obtained in this way was perhaps the sixth-century papyrus Josephus from Sant&#x27;Ambrogio in Milan, and the greatest coup, the acquisition of part of Bobbio&#x27;s ancient library in exchange for &#x27;more useful&#x27; modern books. Bobbio had been founded in the early seventh century by a party of Irish monks under St Columban, and still owned the only substantial group of Italian pre-Caroline manuscripts outside Verona Cathedral.

Cardinal Federigo chose a suitable envoy, Gian Giacomo Valeri, of an old Milanese family, Canon of Santa Maria della Scala and an antiquarian collector on his own account. Negotiations were opened in 1605 and had immediate success. The following year about seventy-four manuscripts reached the Ambrosiana, among them at least two written in Ireland (one at Bangor in County Down), and several palimpsests, one of the submerged texts being of three lost orations of Cicero. 

Antonio Olgiati, the Cardinal&#x27;s librarian and first Prefect of the Ambrosiana, was sent on a buying mission to south Germany, the southern Netherlands and France. Francesco Bernardino Ferrari, later Olgiati&#x27;s successor as Prefect, made a similar journey to Spain. An Ambrosian Doctor, Antonio Salmazia, spent a year from 1607 to 1608 in Corfu hunting for Greek manuscripts. Harassed by delays in the transfer of funds and by the Corfiotes&#x27; hostility, tantalised by travellers&#x27; tales from the mainland of &#x27;a very numerous and good library which once belonged to an Emperor in Constantinople&#x27; or of a Gospels with the words of Christ written in gold and those of &#x27;the Jewish hordes&#x27; in black, he nevertheless succeeded in buying 113 manuscripts by weight (one Corfiote pound weight of manuscript cost five Milanese lire). A group of Greek manuscripts was purchased in Venice from the titular archbishop of Philadelphia, and others were received in a consignment from Chios, and discovered in the monasteries of Abruzzo. Hebrew manuscripts and some rare printed books were obtained from the Jewish communities of Bologna and other Italian towns by Domenico Gerosolimitano, a converted rabbi in the Cardinal&#x27;s service.

Works in Oriental languages have been a feature of the Ambrosiana&#x27;s holdings since its foundation, but little is known of how or where the 340 Arabic, Persian and Turkish manuscripts of the vecchio fondo were acquired. A Lebanese Christian was dispatched to the Levant from 1610 to 1617, but with what result, other than a gift of &#x27;Chaldean books&#x27; from the Maronite patriarch, is not recorded. Probably the advice of Diego de Urrea Conca, a Spanish Arabist living in Naples, was followed; he recommended asking the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller to instruct their ships to buy Arabic manuscripts in quantity when they visited Cairo and ‘those parts’. Even so, the founder&#x27;s appetite for the exotic was not satisfied. He owned works in Glagolitic (the medieval alphabet of Croatia) and a Japanese &quot;Contemptus mundi&quot; printed in Amakusa in 1596, and begged Cardinal Ottavio Bandini’s secretary to find him hieroglyphic books.

In 1601 Cardinal Federigo&#x27;s correspondent and friend, Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, died in Padua. Two hundred volumes of transcripts of state papers were impounded by the Republic of Venice and more books were lost when Barbary pirates attacked the galleys carrying the consignment down the Adriatic to the collector&#x27;s Neapolitan heirs. The remainder of the library was offered at auction in Naples in 1608 (the earliest recorded book auction sale in Italy) and bought for the Ambrosiana for 3,050 scudi. There were further delays - the printed books would not have paid the cost of shipping and had to be left behind, for safe transport it was necessary to wait for the Genoese fleet returning from escorting a new archbishop to Sicily. Eventually in the middle of 1609 five hundred and fifty manuscripts, nearly half of which were Greek, arrived in Milan.

== Building ==
To house the cardinal&#x27;s 15,000 manuscripts and twice that many printed books, construction began in 1603 under designs and direction of Lelio Buzzi and Francesco Maria Richini.

The library was shelved behind brass grilles round the walls of a single room with a high coved ceiling, designed by Richini and Buzzi and completed by 1609. Two friezes of authors&#x27; and artists&#x27; portraits, inspired by Paolo Giovio&#x27;s famous series at Como, ran along the gallery and above the bookcases. The light entered by two enormous semicircular windows at each end of the room. Rooms to hold collections of pictures and casts of antique statues, to which was later added accommodation for schools of painting and sculpture, occupied the remainder of a long narrow building adjoining the churches of San Sepolcro and Santa Maria della Rosa in the centre of Milan.

When its first reading room, the &quot;Sala Fredericiana&quot;, opened to the public on 8 December 1609 it was one of the earliest public libraries. One innovation was that its books were housed in cases ranged along the walls, rather than chained to reading tables, the latter a medieval practice seen still today in the Laurentian Library of Florence. A printing press was attached to the library, and a school for instruction in the classical languages.

Constant acquisitions, soon augmented by bequests, required enlargement of the space. Borromeo intended an academy (which opened in 1625) and a collection of pictures, for which a new building was initiated in 1611–18 to house the Cardinal&#x27;s paintings and drawings, the nucleus of the Pinacoteca. Artwork at the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana includes Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Musician&quot;, Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Basket of Fruit&quot;, Bramantino&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Christ Child&quot; and Raphael&#x27;s cartoon of &quot;The School of Athens&quot;. The library now contains some 12,000 drawings by European artists, from the 14th through the 19th centuries, which have come from the collections of a wide range of patrons and artists, academicians, collectors, art dealers, and architects.

== Collection ==
The Ambrosiana contains several important manuscript works from classical antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1637, six years after the cardinal&#x27;s death, the library acquired twelve manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci, including the &quot;Codex Atlanticus&quot;, from the Marquis Galeazzo Arconati, who had refused a tempting offer from Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel. The &quot;Codex Atlanticus&quot; is the largest single set of drawings by Leonardo. Formed by the sculptor Pompeo Leoni, it incorporates three dismembered notebooks and many single sheets.

Among the 30,000 manuscripts, which range from Greek and Latin to Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopian, Turkish and Persian, is the Muratorian fragment, of &quot;ca&quot; 170 A.D., the earliest example of a Biblical canon and an original copy of &quot;De divina proportione&quot; by Luca Pacioli. Gian Vincenzo Pinelli&#x27;s library, purchased by Cardinal Borromeo in 1608, comprises five hundred and fifty manuscripts, including a fourth- or fifth-century illustrated Homer known as &#x27;the Ambrosian Iliad&#x27;, a tenth- or eleventh-century Horace, a copy of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; written in Padua about 1355, Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;La Fiammetta&quot; annotated by Pietro Bembo, and many antiquarian, humanistic and topical miscellanies. Among Christian and Islamic Arabic manuscripts are treatises on medicine, a unique 11th-century diwan of poets, and the oldest copy of the &quot;Kitab Sibawahaihi&quot;.

Among the treasures of the library are also a Greek Pentateuch of the fifth century; several palimpsest texts, including an early Plautus, fragments of Ulfilas&#x27;s Gothic Bible, and a copy of Virgil, with marginal notes by Petrarch.

== College of Doctors ==

The most original feature of the library&#x27;s constitutions was to separate responsibility for administration from that for the scholarly use of the collections. The former was entrusted to seven conservatori, to include the senior member of the Borromeo family. For the latter purpose a College of Doctors was instituted. They were encouraged to specialise in different subjects and released from all routine duties, but required to publish a learned work within three years of appointment. The librarian was given onerous responsibilities, among them the purchase of new books and advice to the Doctors on subjects for research.

Among the most prominent doctors of the Ambrosiana have been Giuseppe Ripamonti, Ludovico Antonio Muratori, Giuseppe Antonio Sassi, Cardinal Angelo Mai and, at the beginning of the 20th century, Antonio Maria Ceriani, Achille Ratti (on 8 November 1888), the future Pope Pius XI, and Giovanni Mercati. Ratti wrote a new edition of the &quot;Acta Ecclesiae Mediolanensis&quot; (&quot;Acts of the Church of Milan&quot;), Latin work firstly published by the cardinal Federico Borromeo in 1582.

A handful of clauses in the constitutions reflect the Ambrosiana&#x27;s ecclesiastical origin: at least four of the Doctors should profess theology, communication with foreigners &#x27;of depraved religion&#x27; was forbidden, each Doctor within ten years of his appointment must publish a work on the Virgin Mary to whom the college and library were dedicated.

== Later history ==
Several prized manuscripts, including the Leonardo codices, were requisitioned by the French during the Napoleonic occupation, and only partly returned after 1815. In particular, Leonardo&#x27;s aerial screw was taken and is still in the Institut de France in Paris.

In 1943 the building was damaged by an Allied air-raid. Manuscripts and incunables had been removed and escaped intact, and the damage to the fabric was made good after the war (the paintings are now particularly well displayed), but several volumes perished, including the archives of opera libretti of La Scala. The building was restored in 1952 and underwent major restorations in 1990–97.

== In popular culture ==
The Ambrosiana library was from the beginning open to the public (for four hours a day - now increased to five). The great seventeenth century scholar Gabriel Naudé judged that there were at his time only three libraries in all Europe open to the public, namely the Bodleian, the Ambrosiana and the Angelica. This unique feature was well known to early modern travellers. &#x27;The Bibliotheca Ambrosiana is one of the best Libraries in Italy, because it is not so coy as the others, which scarce let themselves be seen; whereas this opens its dores publikly to all comers and goers, and suffers Them to read what book they please&#x27; (Richard Lassels, &quot;The Voyage of Italy&quot;, 1670).

On 15 October 1816 the Romantic poet Lord Byron visited the library. He was delighted by the letters between Lucrezia Borgia and Pietro Bembo (&quot;The prettiest love letters in the world&quot;) and claimed to have managed to steal a lock of her hair (&quot;the prettiest and fairest imaginable.&quot;) held on display.

The novelist Mary Shelley visited the library on 14 September 1840 but was disappointed by the tight security occasioned by the recent attempted theft of &quot;some of the relics of Petrarch&quot; housed there.

<text>Tanagra () is a town and a municipality north of Athens in Boeotia, Greece. The seat of the municipality is the town Schimatari. It is not far from Thebes, and it was noted in antiquity for the figurines named after it. The Tanagra figurines were a mass-produced, mold-cast and fired type of Greek terracotta figurine produced from the later fourth century BC, primarily in Tanagra.

==Government== 
The municipality Tanagra was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Dervenochoria
*Dilesi
*Oinofyta
*Schimatari
*Tanagra

In 2014 the municipal unit Dilesi was created from parts of the municipal units Oinofyta (the village Dilesi) and Schimatari (the village Plaka Dilesi).

==History==
===Ancient===
Tanagra (), sometimes written Tanagraea, was a town of ancient Boeotia, situated upon the left bank of the Asopus, in a fertile plain, at the distance of 130 stadia from Oropus and 200 from Plataeae. Several ancient writers identified Tanagra with the Homeric Graea; but others supposed them to be distinct places, and Aristotle regarded Oropus as the ancient Graea. Pausanias mentions in Tanagra&#x27;s location the ancient city of Graea, eponymous of the &quot;Graikoi&quot;, a Boeotian tribe whose name gave rise to the Latin &quot;Graecus&quot; &quot;Greek&quot; which later spread throughout the western world as the name of the Greeks and Greece. Homer, while reciting the Boeotian forces in the &quot;Iliad&quot;″s Catalogue of Ships, provides the first known reference to the Boeotian city of Graea.

Tanagra was also called Poemandria or Poimandria (Ποιμανδρία), and its territory Poemandris, from the fertile meadows which surrounded the city, or after its founder Poimandros, who took part in the Trojan campaign. The most ancient inhabitants of Tanagra are said to have been the Gephyraei, who came from Phoenicia with Cadmus, and from thence emigrated to Athens. From its vicinity to Attica the territory of Tanagra was the scene of more than one battle. In 457 BC the Lacedaemonians on their return from an expedition to Doris, took up a position at Tanagra, near the borders of Attica, with the view of assisting the oligarchical party at Athens to overthrow the democracy. The Athenians, with a thousand Argeians and some Thessalian horse, crossed Mount Parnes and advanced, against the Lacedaemonians. In the First Battle of Tanagra, both sides fought with great bravery; but the Lacedaemonians gained the victory, chiefly through the treacherous desertion of the Thessalians in the very heat of the engagement. At the beginning of the following year (456 BC), and only sixty-two days after their defeat at Tanagra, the Athenians under Myronides again invaded Boeotia, and gained at Oenophyta, in the territory of Tanagra, a brilliant and decisive victory over the Boeotian League, which made them masters of the whole country (see Battle of Oenophyta). The walls of Tanagra were now razed to the ground. The Second Battle of Tanagra was fought in 426 BC. the Athenians made an incursion into the territory of Tanagra, and on their return defeated the Tanagraeans and Boeotians.

Dicaearchus, who visited Tanagra in the time of Cassander, says that the city stood on a rugged and lofty height, and had a white chalky appearance. The houses are adorned with handsome porticoes and encaustic paintings. The surrounding country does not grow much corn, but produces the best wine in Boeotia. Dicaearchus adds that the inhabitants are wealthy but frugal, being for the most part landholders, not manufacturers; and he praises them for their justice, good faith, and hospitality. In the time of Augustus, Tanagra and Thespiae were the two most prosperous cities in Boeotia. Tanagra is called by Pliny the Elder a free state; it is mentioned by Ptolemy; and it continued to flourish in the sixth century.

Its public buildings are described at some length by Pausanias. The principal temple was that of Dionysus, which contained a celebrated statue of Parian marble, by Calamis, and a remarkable Triton. Near it were temples of Themis, Aphrodite and Apollo, and two of Hermes, in one of which he was worshipped as Criophorus, and in the other as Promachus. Near the latter was the theatre, and probably at no great distance the gymnasium, which contained a picture of Corinna, who was a native of Tanagra. There was also a monument of this poet in a conspicuous part of the city. Pausanias remarks as a peculiarity in Tanagra, that all their sacred buildings were placed by themselves, apart from the houses of the town. He likewise notices that Tanagra was famous for its breed of fighting-cocks, a circumstance which is mentioned by other writers. Tanagra possessed a considerable territory; and Strabo mentions four villages belonging to it, Eleon or Heleon, Harma, Mycalessus, and Pharae.

The ruins of the ancient city are located at approximately: .

===Modern===
In the early 1870s, a spate of looting at Tanagra&#x27;s necropolis saw the theft of artefacts, including figurines, from around 10,000 tombs. This episode raised the profile of the illegal excavation and export of antiquities among the Greek press and public, and led to the excavation of the site by Panagiotis Stamatakis between 1871 and 1873.

In the early 2000s, a military plane which was on a training flight crashed on the runway during bad weather. There were no survivors.

On Sunday 18 September 2005, the Archangelos air show, the largest ever organized in Greece, took place in Tanagra. It attracted a crowd of more than 200,000.

==Geography==
The municipality has an area of 461.023 km2, the municipal unit 122.527 km2, the community 27.814 km2. Tanagra is located SE of Thiva and Arma, SW of Schimatari and NW of Agios Thomas. Farmlands surround the rest of Tanagra, and the Asopus River along with the Parnitha mountains to the south.

==Demographics==

Arvanites settled in Tanagra in the Middle Ages, but today they only make up a linguistic minority.

==Economy==

Since 1956, the 114th Combat Wing of the Hellenic Air Force has been based in Tanagra Air Base. The base is one of Greece&#x27;s largest military airports and its runway is about 3 km in length.

The Hellenic Aerospace Industry production and maintenance facilities have been located in the town since 1975.

==Transport==

Tanagra can be accessed by GR-1 in the north and by a provincial road linking Thiva (Thebes) in the west.

Tanagra is served by two interchanges, a partial southbound exit, a northbound entrance to the northwest and an almost-full to the east, serving access to highways 44 and 77 to the island of Euboea. Its service road lies to the south and is linked with the southeast bypass and to the military base.

<text>Terence Francis Eagleton (born 22 February 1943) is an English literary theorist, critic, and public intellectual. He is currently Distinguished Professor of English Literature at Lancaster University.

Eagleton has published over forty books, but remains best known for &quot;Literary Theory: An Introduction&quot; (1983), which has sold over 750,000 copies. The work elucidated the emerging literary theory of the period, as well as arguing that all literary theory is necessarily political. He has also been a prominent critic of postmodernism, publishing works such as &quot;The Illusions of Postmodernism&quot; (1996) and &quot;After Theory&quot; (2003). He argues that, influenced by postmodernism, cultural theory has wrongly devalued objectivity and ethics. His thinking is influenced by Marxism and Christianity.

Formerly the Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford (1992–2001) and John Edward Taylor Professor of Cultural Theory at the University of Manchester (2001–2008), Eagleton has held visiting appointments at universities around the world including Cornell, Duke, Iowa, Melbourne, Trinity College Dublin, and Yale.

Eagleton delivered Yale University&#x27;s 2008 Terry Lectures and the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s 2010 Gifford Lecture entitled &quot;The God Debate&quot;. He gave the 2010 Richard Price Memorial Lecture at Newington Green Unitarian Church, speaking on &quot;The New Atheism and the War on Terror&quot;. In 2009, he published a book which accompanied his lectures on religion, entitled &quot;Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate&quot;.

==Early life==
Eagleton was born in Salford, Lancashire, England, on 22 February 1943, to Francis Paul Eagleton and his wife, Rosaleen (née Riley) Eagleton. He grew up in a working-class Catholic family of Irish descent in Salford, with roots in County Galway. His mother&#x27;s side of the family had strong Irish republican sympathies. He served as an altar boy at a local Carmelite convent where he was responsible for escorting novice nuns taking their vows, a role referred to in the title of his memoir &quot;The Gatekeeper&quot; (2002).

==Education and academia==
Eagleton was educated at De La Salle College, a Roman Catholic grammar school in Pendleton, Salford. In 1961, he went to read English at Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated with first-class honours. He later described his undergraduate experience as a &quot;waste of time&quot;. In 1964, he moved to Jesus College, Cambridge, where as a junior research fellow and doctoral student, he became the youngest fellow at the college since the 18th century. He was supervised by Raymond Williams. It was during this period that his socialist convictions began to take hold, and he edited a radical Catholic leftist periodical called &quot;Slant&quot;.

In 1969, he moved to the University of Oxford where he became a fellow and tutor of Wadham College (1969–1989), Linacre College (1989–1993) and St Catherine&#x27;s College, becoming Thomas Warton Professor of English in 1992. At Wadham, Eagleton ran a well-known seminar on Marxist literary theory which, in the 1980s, metamorphosed into the radical pressure group Oxford English Limited and its journal &quot;News from Nowhere: Journal of the Oxford English Faculty Opposition&quot;, to which he contributed several pieces. In 2001, Eagleton left Oxford to become the John Edward Taylor Professor of English at the University of Manchester.

==Career==
Eagleton began his literary studies with the 19th and 20th centuries, then conformed to the stringent academic Marxism of the 1970s. He then published an attack on his mentor Williams&#x27;s relation to the Marxist tradition in the pages of the &quot;New Left Review&quot;, in the mode of the French critic Louis Althusser. In the 1960s, he became involved with the left-wing Catholic group &quot;Slant&quot;, authoring a number of theological articles (including &quot;A Marxist Interpretation of Benediction&quot;), as well as a book &quot;Towards a New Left Theology&quot;. A major turning point was his &quot;Criticism &amp; Ideology&quot; (1976) in which Eagleton discusses various theorists and critics from F. R. Leavis and (his tutor) Raymond Williams to Pierre Macherey. This earliest response to Theory is critical and substantive with Eagleton supplying a dense web of categories for &quot;a materialist criticism&quot; which situates the author as well as the text in the general mode of production, the &quot;literary&quot; mode of production and particular ideologies. In chapter 4 he gives a thorough overview of one theme in the English context – &quot;organicist concepts of society&quot; or &quot;community&quot; – as worked by petty-bourgeois Victorian writers, from George Eliot to D. H. Lawrence, and how this determines textual form in each instance.

===&quot;Literary Theory&quot; and &quot;After Theory&quot;===
In &quot;Literary Theory: An Introduction&quot; (1983, revised 1996), Eagleton surveys the history of theoretical approaches to literature, from its beginnings with Matthew Arnold, through formalism, psychoanalysis, and structuralism, to post-structuralism. In the process, he demonstrates what is the thesis of the book: that theory is necessarily political. Theory is always presented as if it is unstained by point of view and is neutral, but in fact it is impossible to avoid having a political perspective. Peter Barry has said of the book that it &quot;greatly contributed to the &#x27;consolidation&#x27; of literary theory and helped to establish it firmly on the undergraduate curriculum&quot;. Eagleton&#x27;s approach to literary criticism is one firmly rooted in the Marxist tradition, though he has also incorporated techniques and ideas from more recent modes of thought as structuralism, Lacanian analysis and deconstruction. As his memoir &quot;The Gatekeeper&quot; recounts, Eagleton&#x27;s Marxism has never been solely an academic pursuit. He was active in the International Socialists (along with Christopher Hitchens) and then the Workers&#x27; Socialist League whilst in Oxford. He has been a regular contributor to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

&quot;After Theory&quot; (2003) was written two decades later, after the end of the great period of High Theory – the cultural theory of Foucault, the postmodernists, Derrida, et al. Looking back, Eagleton evaluates its achievements and failures, and proposes new directions needing to be pursued. He considers that among the great achievements of Theory were the expansion of objects of study (to include gender, sexuality, popular culture, post-colonialism, etc.), and the wide-ranging self-reflective criticism of traditional assumptions. But in Eagleton&#x27;s estimation there were also many serious mistakes, for instance: the assault on the normative and the insistence on the relativity of truth leaves us powerless to criticize oppression; the rejection of objectivity and (excessively) of all forms of essentialism bespeak an unrecognized idealism, or at least a blindness to our human materiality, ultimately born of an unconscious fear of death; and cultural studies has wrongly avoided consideration of ethics, which for Eagleton is inextricably tied to a proper politics. It is virtue and politics and how they may be realized, among other things, that Eagleton offers as new avenues needing to be explored by cultural studies. &quot;After Theory&quot; fleshes out this political aspect, tied to ethics, growing out of the fact that humans exist in neediness and dependency on others, their freedom bounded by the common fact of death.

===Dawkins, Hitchens and the New Atheism===
Eagleton has become a vocal critic of what has been called the New Atheism. In October 2006, he published a review of Richard Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The God Delusion&quot; in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. Eagleton begins by questioning Dawkins&#x27;s methodology and understanding: &quot;Imagine someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is the &quot;Book of British Birds&quot;, and you have a rough idea of what it feels like to read Richard Dawkins on theology.&quot; Eagleton further writes, &quot;Nor does [Dawkins] understand that because God is transcendent of us (which is another way of saying that he did not have to bring us about), he is free of any neurotic need for us and wants simply to be allowed to love us.&quot; He concludes by suggesting Dawkins has not been attacking organised faith so much as a sort of rhetorical straw man:

====Terry and Gifford Lectures====
In April 2008 Eagleton delivered Yale University&#x27;s Terry Lectures, with the title &quot;Faith and Fundamentalism: Is belief in Richard Dawkins necessary for salvation?&quot;, constituting a continuation of the critique he had begun in &quot;The London Review of Books&quot;. Introducing his first lecture with an admission of ignorance of both theology and science, Eagleton goes on to affirm: &quot;All I can claim in this respect, alas, is that I think I may know just about enough theology to be able to spot when someone like Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens – a couplet I shall henceforth reduce for convenience to the solitary signifier &quot;Ditchkins&quot; – is talking out of the back of his neck.&quot; An expanded version of these lectures was published in 2009 as &quot;Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate&quot;.

===Football===
Eagleton sees football as a new opium of the people distracting ordinary people from more serious, important social concerns. Eagleton is pessimistic as to whether this distraction can be ended:
==Criticism of Martin and Kingsley Amis==

In late 2007, a critique of Martin Amis included in the introduction to a 2007 edition of Eagleton&#x27;s book &quot;Ideology&quot; was widely reprinted in the British press. In it, Eagleton took issue with Amis&#x27; widely quoted writings on &quot;Islamism&quot;, directing particular attention to one specific passage from an interview with Ginny Dougary published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 9 September 2006. 

Eagleton criticised Amis and expressed surprise as to its source, stating: &quot;[these are] not the ramblings of a British National Party thug ... but the reflections of Martin Amis, leading luminary of the English metropolitan literary world.&quot; He drew a connection between Amis and his father (the novelist Kingsley Amis). Eagleton went on to write that Martin Amis had learned more from his father – whom Eagleton described as a reactionary &quot;racist, anti-Semitic boor, a drink-sodden, self-hating reviler of women, gays and liberals&quot; – than merely &quot;how to turn a shapely phrase.&quot; Eagleton added there was &quot;something rather stomach-churning at the sight of those such as Amis and his political allies, champions of a civilisation that for centuries has wreaked untold carnage throughout the world, shrieking for illegal measures when they find themselves for the first time on the sticky end of the same treatment.&quot;

The essay became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in British literary circles. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, a commentator for &quot;The Independent&quot;, wrote an article about the affair, to which Amis responded via open letter, calling Eagleton &quot;an ideological relict ... unable to get out of bed in the morning without the dual guidance of God and Karl Marx.&quot; Amis said the views Eagleton attributed to him as his considered opinion was in fact his spoken description of a tempting urge, in relation to the need to &quot;raise the price&quot; of terrorist actions. Eagleton&#x27;s personal comments on Kingsley Amis prompted a further response from Kingsley&#x27;s widow, the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard. Howard wrote to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, noting that for a supposed &quot;anti-semitic homophobe&quot;, it was peculiar that the only guests at the Howard–Amis nuptials were either Jewish or gay. As Howard explained, &quot;Kingsley was never a racist, nor an anti-Semitic boor. Our four great friends who witnessed our wedding were three Jews and one homosexual.&quot; Colin Howard, Howard&#x27;s homosexual brother, called Eagleton &quot;a little squirt&quot;, adding that Sir Kingsley, far from being homophobic, had extended an affectionate friendship to him and helped him come to terms with his sexuality.

Eagleton defended his comments about Martin and Kingsley Amis in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, claiming the main bone of contention – the substance of Amis&#x27; remarks and views – had been lost amid the media furore.

==Critical reactions==
William Deresiewicz wrote of &quot;After Theory&quot;, Eagleton&#x27;s book, as follows... :
The novelist and critic David Lodge, writing in the May 2004 &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; on &quot;Theory&quot; and &quot;After Theory&quot;, concluded:
Jonathan Bate stressed the importance of Eagleton&#x27;s Roman Catholic background in &quot;Saint Terence&quot;, a 1991 review-essay in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; before the overt religious turn in Eagleton&#x27;s later works.

==Personal life==
Eagleton has been married twice. His first marriage was to Rosemary Galpin, a nurse; his second marriage was to American academic Willa Murphy. They have since divorced. Eagleton has five children: Dominic Eagleton, Daniel Eagleton, the journalist Oliver Eagleton, Alice Eagleton and Owen Eagleton. His daughter-in-law is theatre director Andrea Ferran.

<text>Ewald Georg von Kleist (10 June 1700 – 11 December 1748), also known as Ewald Jürgen von Kleist, was a German jurist, Lutheran cleric, physicist and the inventor of the Leyden jar.

A member of the von Kleist family, Ewald was born in Wicewo in Farther Pomerania. His father was district administrator (1657–1716). He studied jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig and the University of Leyden and may have started his interest in electricity at the latter university under the influence of Willem &#x27;s Gravesande. From 1722–1745 or 1747 he was dean of the in Kamień Pomorski, in the Kingdom of Prussia, after which he became president of the royal court of justice in Köslin. He was a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin.

Influenced by Georg Matthias Bose, he independently invented the Kleistian jar on 11 October 1745, which could store electricity in large quantities. He communicated this discovery to a group of Berlin scientists in late 1745, and the news was transferred in a confused form to Leyden University where it was further investigated. This became more commonly known as the Leyden jar after graduate student Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leyden.

<text>In mathematical finance, a risk-neutral measure (also called an equilibrium measure, or &quot;equivalent martingale measure&quot;) is a probability measure such that each share price is exactly equal to the discounted expectation of the share price under this measure.
This is heavily used in the pricing of financial derivatives due to the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, which implies that in a complete market, a derivative&#x27;s price is the discounted expected value of the future payoff under the unique risk-neutral measure. Such a measure exists if and only if the market is arbitrage-free.

==A risk-neutral measure is a probability measure==

The easiest way to remember what the risk-neutral measure is, or to explain it to a probability generalist who might not know much about finance, is to realize that it is:

# The probability measure of a transformed random variable. Typically this transformation is the utility function of the payoff. The risk-neutral measure would be the measure corresponding to an expectation of the payoff with a linear utility.
# An &quot;implied&quot; probability measure, that is one implied from the current observable/posted/traded prices of the relevant instruments. Relevant means those instruments that are causally linked to the events in the probability space under consideration (i.e. underlying prices plus derivatives), and
# It is the implied probability measure (solves a kind of inverse problem) that is defined using a linear (risk-neutral) utility in the payoff, assuming some known model for the payoff. This means that you try to find the risk-neutral measure by solving the equation where current prices are the expected present value of the future pay-offs under the risk-neutral measure. The concept of a unique risk-neutral measure is most useful when one imagines making prices across a number of derivatives that &quot;would&quot; make a unique risk-neutral measure, since it implies a kind of consistency in one&#x27;s hypothetical untraded prices, and theoretically points to arbitrage opportunities in markets where bid/ask prices are visible.

It is also worth noting that in most introductory applications in finance, the pay-offs under consideration are deterministic given knowledge of prices at some terminal or future point in time. This is not strictly necessary to make use of these techniques.

==Motivating the use of risk-neutral measures==
Prices of assets depend crucially on their risk as investors typically demand more profit for bearing more risk. Therefore, today&#x27;s price of a claim on a risky amount realised tomorrow will generally differ from its expected value. Most commonly, investors are risk-averse and today&#x27;s price is &quot;below&quot; the expectation, remunerating those who bear the risk.

It turns out that in a complete market with no arbitrage opportunities there is an alternative way to do this calculation: Instead of first taking the expectation and then adjusting for an investor&#x27;s risk preference, one can adjust, once and for all, the probabilities of future outcomes such that they incorporate all investors&#x27; risk premia, and then take the expectation under this new probability distribution, the &quot;risk-neutral measure&quot;. The main benefit stems from the fact that once the risk-neutral probabilities are found, &quot;every&quot; asset can be priced by simply taking the present value of its expected payoff. Note that if we used the actual real-world probabilities, every security would require a different adjustment (as they differ in riskiness).

The absence of arbitrage is crucial for the existence of a risk-neutral measure. In fact, by the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, the condition of no-arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a risk-neutral measure. Completeness of the market is also important because in an incomplete market there are a multitude of possible prices for an asset corresponding to different risk-neutral measures. It is usual to argue that market efficiency implies that there is only one price (the &quot;law of one price&quot;); the correct risk-neutral measure to price which must be selected using economic, rather than purely mathematical, arguments.

A common mistake is to confuse the constructed probability distribution with the real-world probability. They will be different because in the real-world, investors demand risk premia, whereas it can be shown that under the risk-neutral probabilities all assets have the same expected rate of return, the risk-free rate (or short rate) and thus do not incorporate any such premia. The method of risk-neutral pricing should be considered as many other useful computational tools—convenient and powerful, even if seemingly artificial.

==Definition==

=== Equivalent martingale measure ===
Let formula_1 be a d-dimensional market representing the price processes of the risky assets, formula_2 the risk-free bond and formula_3 the underlying probability space. Then a measure formula_4 is called an equivalent (local) martingale measure if

# formula_5, i.e., formula_4 is equivalent to formula_7,
# the processes formula_8 are (local) martingales w.r.t. formula_4 formula_10.

=== Risk-neutral measure ===
Risk-neutral measures make it easy to express the value of a derivative in a formula. Suppose at a future time formula_11 a derivative (e.g., a call option on a stock) pays formula_12 units, where formula_12 is a random variable on the probability space describing the market. Further suppose that the discount factor from now (time zero) until time formula_11 is formula_15. Then today&#x27;s fair value of the derivative is

:formula_16

where any martingale measure formula_4 that solves the equation is a risk-neutral measure.

===Change of measure===

This can be re-stated in terms of an alternative measure &quot;P&quot; as

:formula_18

where formula_19 is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of formula_4 with respect to formula_7, and therefore is still a martingale.

If in a financial market there is just one risk-neutral measure, then there is a unique arbitrage-free price for each asset in the market. This is the fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing. If there are more such measures, then in an interval of prices no arbitrage is possible. If no equivalent martingale measure exists, arbitrage opportunities do.

In markets with transaction costs, with no numéraire, the consistent pricing process takes the place of the equivalent martingale measure. There is in fact a 1-to-1 relation between a consistent pricing process and an equivalent martingale measure.

==Example 1 – Binomial model of stock prices==
Given a probability space formula_22, consider a single-period binomial model, denote the initial stock price as formula_23 and the stock price at time 1 as formula_24 which can randomly take on possible values: formula_25 if the stock moves up, or formula_26 if the stock moves down. Finally, let formula_27 denote the risk-free rate. These quantities need to satisfy formula_28 else there is arbitrage in the market and an agent can generate wealth from nothing. 

A probability measure formula_29 on formula_30 is called risk-neutral if formula_31 which can be written as formula_32. Solving for formula_33 we find that the risk-neutral probability of an upward stock movement is given by the number 

:formula_34

Given a derivative with payoff formula_35 when the stock price moves up and formula_36 when it goes down, we can price the derivative via

:formula_37

==Example 2 – Brownian motion model of stock prices==
Suppose our economy consists of 2 assets, a stock and a risk-free bond, and that we use the Black–Scholes model. In the model the evolution of the stock price can be described by Geometric Brownian Motion:

:formula_38

where formula_39 is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the physical measure. If we define

:formula_40

Girsanov&#x27;s theorem states that there exists a measure formula_4 under which formula_42 is a Brownian motion.
formula_43 is known as the market price of risk.
Utilizing rules within Itô calculus, one may informally differentiate with respect to formula_44 and rearrange the above expression to derive the SDE
:formula_45
Put this back in the original equation:
:formula_46

Let formula_47 be the discounted stock price given by formula_48, then by Ito&#x27;s lemma we get the SDE:
:formula_49

formula_4 is the unique risk-neutral measure for the model.
The discounted payoff process of a derivative on the stock formula_51 is a martingale under formula_4. Notice the drift of the SDE is formula_53, the risk-free interest rate, implying risk neutrality. Since formula_54 and formula_55 are formula_4-martingales we can invoke the martingale representation theorem to find a replicating strategy – a portfolio of stocks and bonds that pays off formula_57 at all times formula_58.

==Origin of the risk-neutral measure==
It is natural to ask how a risk-neutral measure arises in a market free of arbitrage. Somehow the prices of all assets will determine a probability measure. One explanation is given by utilizing the Arrow security. For simplicity, consider a discrete (even finite) world with only one future time horizon. In other words, there is the present (time 0) and the future (time 1), and at time 1 the state of the world can be one of finitely many states. An Arrow security corresponding to state &quot;n&quot;, &quot;An&quot;, is one which pays $1 at time 1 in state &quot;n&quot; and $0 in any of the other states of the world.

What is the price of &quot;An&quot; now? It must be positive as there is a chance you will gain $1; it should be less than $1 as that is the maximum possible payoff. Thus the price of each &quot;An&quot;, which we denote by &quot;An(0)&quot;, is strictly between 0 and 1.

Actually, the sum of all the security prices must be equal to the present value of $1, because holding a portfolio consisting of each Arrow security will result in certain payoff of $1. Consider a raffle where a single ticket wins a prize of all entry fees: if the prize is $1, the entry fee will be 1/number of tickets. For simplicity, we will consider the interest rate to be 0, so that the present value of $1 is $1.

Thus the &quot;An(0)&quot;″s satisfy the axioms for a probability distribution. Each is non-negative and their sum is 1. This is the risk-neutral measure! Now it remains to show that it works as advertised, i.e. taking expected values with respect to this probability measure will give the right price at time 0.

Suppose you have a security &quot;C&quot; whose price at time 0 is &quot;C(0)&quot;. In the future, in a state &quot;i&quot;, its payoff will be &quot;Ci&quot;. Consider a portfolio &quot;P&quot; consisting of &quot;Ci&quot; amount of each Arrow security &quot;Ai&quot;. In the future, whatever state &quot;i&quot; occurs, then &quot;Ai&quot; pays $1 while the other Arrow securities pay $0, so &quot;P&quot; will pay &quot;Ci&quot;. In other words, the portfolio &quot;P&quot; replicates the payoff of &quot;C&quot; regardless of what happens in the future. The lack of arbitrage opportunities implies that the price of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;C&quot; must be the same now, as any difference in price means we can, without any risk, (short) sell the more expensive, buy the cheaper, and pocket the difference. In the future we will need to return the short-sold asset but we can fund that exactly by selling our bought asset, leaving us with our initial profit.

By regarding each Arrow security price as a &quot;probability&quot;, we see that the portfolio price &quot;P(0)&quot; is the expected value of &quot;C&quot; under the risk-neutral probabilities. If the interest rate R were not zero, we would need to discount the expected value appropriately to get the price. In particular, the portfolio consisting of each Arrow security now has a present value of formula_59, so the risk-neutral probability of state i becomes formula_60 times the price of each Arrow security &quot;Ai&quot;, or its forward price.

Note that Arrow securities do not actually need to be traded in the market. This is where market completeness comes in. In a complete market, every Arrow security can be replicated using a portfolio of real, traded assets. The argument above still works considering each Arrow security as a portfolio.

In a more realistic model, such as the Black–Scholes model and its generalizations, our Arrow security would be something like a double digital option, which pays off $1 when the underlying asset lies between a lower and an upper bound, and $0 otherwise. The price of such an option then reflects the market&#x27;s view of the likelihood of the spot price ending up in that price interval, adjusted by risk premia, entirely analogous to how we obtained the probabilities above for the one-step discrete world.

<text>The 11th Airborne Division (&quot;Arctic Angels&quot;) is a United States Army multirole infantry division made up of specialized light infantry and airborne infantry based in Alaska. 

Currently, this unit specializes in arctic warfare, airborne operations, combined arms, maneuver warfare, and urban warfare.

First activated on 25 February 1943, during World War II, it was held in reserve in the United States until June 1944 when it was transferred to the Pacific Theater where it saw combat in the Philippines. On 30 August 1945 the division was sent to southern Japan as part of the occupation force where it remained for four years. One parachute infantry regiment was detached for service in the Korean War. On 30 June 1958 the division was inactivated.

In the summer of 2022 the U.S. Army Alaska headquarters was redesignated as the 11th Airborne Division, and the two Brigade Combat Teams in Alaska, the 1st Brigade Combat Team and 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, were transferred to the 11th Airborne Division and redesignated as the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 11th Airborne Division.

==World War II==
===Formation===
Inspired by the pioneering German use of large-scale airborne formations during the Battle of France in 1940 and later the invasion of Crete in 1941, the various Allied powers decided to raise airborne units of their own. One of the resultant five American and two British airborne divisions, the 11th Airborne Division, was officially activated on 25 February 1943 at Camp Mackall in North Carolina, under the command of Major General Joseph Swing. As formed, the division consisted of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment and the 188th Glider Infantry Regiment, and with a complement of 8,321 men was around half the strength of a regular U.S. infantry division of World War II.
The division initially remained in the United States for training, which in common with all airborne units was extremely arduous to befit their elite status. Training included lengthy forced marches, simulated parachute landings from towers, and practice jumps from transport aircraft; hesitancy in the doorway of an aircraft resulted in an automatic failure for the candidate. The washout rate was high, but there was never a shortage of candidates, especially because in American airborne units the rate of pay was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman.

Before training was complete a debate developed in the U.S. Army over whether the best use of airborne forces was &quot;en masse&quot; or as small, compact units. On 9 July 1943, the first large-scale Allied airborne operation was carried out by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the British 1st Airborne Division in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily, code-named Operation Husky. The 11th Airborne Division commanding general, Swing, was temporarily transferred to act as airborne advisor to General Dwight D. Eisenhower for the operation and observed the airborne assault which went badly. The 82nd Airborne Division had been inserted by parachute and had suffered high casualties, leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives.

===Swing Board===
Eisenhower reviewed the airborne role in Operation Husky and concluded that large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, the overall commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by the performance of airborne units in North Africa and more recently Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers, including the Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, believed otherwise. Marshall persuaded Eisenhower to set up a review board and to withhold judgement until the outcome of a large-scale maneuver, planned for December 1943, could be assessed.

When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne in mid-September 1943, he was given the role of preparing the exercise. McNair ordered him to form a committee—the Swing Board—composed of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), parachute, glider infantry and artillery officers, whose arrangements for the maneuver would effectively decide the fate of divisional-sized airborne forces. As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States and had not yet been earmarked for combat, the Swing Board selected it as the test formation. The maneuver would additionally provide the 11th Airborne and its individual units with further training, as had occurred several months previously in an earlier large-scale exercise conducted by the 101st
and the 82nd Airborne Divisions.

====Knollwood Maneuver====
The 11th Airborne, as the attacking force, was assigned the objective of capturing Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina. The force defending the airfield and its environs was a combat team composed of elements of the 17th Airborne Division and a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment. The entire operation was observed by McNair, who would ultimately have a significant say in deciding the fate of the parachute infantry divisions.

The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December 1943, with the 11th Airborne Division being airlifted to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, two of which carried paratroopers while the other two towed gliders. Each group took off from a different airfield in the Carolinas. The four groups deployed a total of 4,800 troops in the first wave. Eighty-five percent were delivered to their targets without navigational error, and the airborne troops seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield and secured the landing area for the rest of the division before daylight. With its initial objectives taken, the 11th Airborne Division then launched a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment and conducted several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with USAAF transport aircraft. The exercise was judged by observers to be a great success. McNair, pleased by its results, attributed this success to the great improvements in airborne training that had been implemented in the months following Operation Husky. As a result of the Knollwood Maneuver, division-sized airborne forces were deemed to be feasible and Eisenhower permitted their retention.

===Leyte===
Following the Knollwood Maneuver the 11th Airborne remained in reserve until January 1944, when it was moved by train from Camp Mackall to Camp Polk in Louisiana. After four weeks of final preparation for its combat role, in April the division was moved to Camp Stoneman, California and then transferred to Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, between 25 May and 11 June. From June to September the division underwent acclimatization and continued its airborne training, conducting parachute drops in the New Guinea jungle and around the airfield in Dobodura. During this period, most of the glider troops became parachute-qualified making the division almost fully airborne. On 11 November the division boarded a convoy of naval transports and was escorted to Leyte in the Philippines, arriving on 18 November. Four days later it was attached to XXIV Corps and committed to combat, but operating as an infantry division rather than in an airborne capacity. The 11th Airborne was ordered to relieve the 7th Infantry Division stationed in the Burauen-La Paz-Bugho area, engage and destroy all Japanese forces in its operational area, and protect XXIV Corps rear-area supply dumps and airfields.

Swing ordered the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR) to guard the rear installations of XXIV Corps, while the 188th GIR was to secure the division&#x27;s rear and conduct aggressive patrols to eliminate any enemy troops in the area. The 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) was assigned the task of destroying all Japanese formations in the division&#x27;s operational area, which it began on 28 November when it relieved the 7th Infantry. The 511th PIR advanced overland with two battalions abreast and the third in reserve, but progress proved slow in the face of fierce Japanese resistance, a lack of mapped trails and heavy rainfall (with more than falling in November alone). As the advance continued resupply became progressively more difficult; the division resorted to using large numbers of Piper Cub aircraft to drop food and ammunition. Several attempts were made to improve the rate of advance, such as dropping platoons of the 187th GIR from Piper Cubs in front of the 511th PIR to reconnoiter, and using C-47 transport aircraft to drop artillery pieces to the regiment&#x27;s location when other forms of transport, such as mule-trains, failed.
On 6 December the Japanese tried to disrupt operations on Leyte by conducting two small-scale airborne raids. The first attempted to deploy a small number of Japanese airborne troops to occupy several key American-held airfields at Tacloban and Dulag, but failed when the three aircraft used were either shot-down, crash-landed or destroyed on the ground along with their passengers. The second, larger, raid was carried out by between 29 and 39 transport aircraft supported by fighters; despite heavy losses, the Japanese managed to drop a number of airborne troops around Burauen airfield, where the headquarters of 11th Airborne Division were located. Six L-5 Sentinel reconnaissance aircraft and one C-47 transport were destroyed, but the raiders were eliminated by an &quot;ad hoc&quot; combat group of artillerymen, engineers and support troops led by Swing.

The 511th PIR was reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, 187th GIR, and continued its slow but steady progress. On 17 December it broke through the Japanese lines and arrived at the western shoreline of Leyte, linking up with elements of the 32nd Infantry Division. It was during this period that Private Elmer E. Fryar earned a posthumous Medal of Honor when he helped to repel a counterattack, personally killing twenty-seven Japanese soldiers before being mortally wounded by a sniper. The regiment was ordered to set up temporary defensive positions before being relieved on 25 December by the 1st Batt., 187th GIR, and the 2nd Batt., 188th GIR, who would themselves incur considerable casualties against a heavily dug-in enemy. The 511th PIR was reassembled at its original base-camp in Leyte on 15 January 1945.

===Luzon===

On 22 January the division was placed on alert for an operation on the island of Luzon, to the north of Leyte. Five days later the 187th and 188th Glider Infantry Regiments were embarked for Luzon by sea, while the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment flew by C-46 Commando transport aircraft to Mindoro. At dawn on 31 January the 188th GIR led an amphibious assault near Nasugbu, in southern Luzon. Supported by a short naval barrage, A-20 Havoc light bombers and P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft, a beach-head was established in the face of light Japanese resistance. The regiment moved rapidly to secure Nasugbu, after which its 1st Battalion advanced up the island&#x27;s arterial Highway 17 to deny the Japanese time to establish defenses further inland. The 2nd Battalion moved south, crossing the River Lian and securing the division&#x27;s right flank. By 10:30 elements of the 188th had pushed deep into southern Luzon, creating the space for the 187th GIR to come ashore. The 188th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was relieved and the regiment continued its advance, reaching the River Palico by 14:30 and securing a vital bridge before it could be destroyed by Japanese combat engineers.
Following Highway 17 to Tumalin, the regiment began to encounter heavier Japanese resistance. At midnight the 187th took over the lead and the two glider infantry regiments rested briefly before tackling the main Japanese defensive lines. These consisted of trenches linked to bunkers and fortified caves, and were manned by several hundred infantry with numerous artillery pieces in support. At 09:00 on 1 February the glider infantry launched their assault, and by midday had managed to break through the first Japanese position; they spent the rest of the day conducting mopping up operations. On the morning of 2 February the second line was breached, and by midnight the 188th had broken a third. The divisional reconnaissance platoon was now in the vicinity of Tagaytay Ridge, the intended site of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment&#x27;s first combat drop.

The 511th&#x27;s airborne operation had originally been scheduled for 2 February, but with Swing&#x27;s insistence that the drop was only to go ahead if his ground forces were in range to offer support, the dogged Japanese resistance encountered delayed the operation. With only 48 C-47s available, the 511th was forced to deploy in three waves. The regimental staff, the 2nd Battalion and half of the 3rd Battalion would drop first, the rest of the regiment would arrive in the second lift, and the 457th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion would drop in the third.
At 03:00 on 3 February the troops of the first lift entered their transport planes, and at 07:00 the first transports left Mindoro. Protected by an escort of P-61 Black Widow night fighters, on arriving over Luzon they followed Highway 17 to Tagaytay Ridge. The ridge itself was an open space some long and wide, plowed in places, and had been largely cleared of Japanese troops by local Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas. At 08:15 the first echelon of the first lift, approximately 345 men, successfully parachuted into the drop zone. The second echelon, consisting of approximately 570 men, were dropped prematurely and landed about to the east. The next lift also encountered problems, with 425 men dropping correctly but another 1,325 dropping early due to pilot error and poor jump discipline. However, the entire regiment was assembled within five hours of the first landings. After overcoming minor Japanese resistance, by 15:00 the 511th had made contact with the 188th and 187th, and the entire division was once again assembled as a single formation. The ridge having been cleared of its remaining defenders, the division began to advance towards Manila, with the national highway in Silang, Dasmarinas, Imus and Bacoor where cleared by Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces FACGF under General Mariano Castaneda and reaching the Paranaque River by 21:00. The city was protected by the Genko Line, a major Japanese defensive belt that stretched along Manila&#x27;s southern edge. The line consisted of approximately 1,200 two- to three-story deep blockhouses, many of which emplaced naval guns or large-caliber mortars. Entrenched heavy anti-aircraft weapons, machine-gun nests and booby-traps made of naval bombs completed the defenses, which were manned by around 6,000 Japanese soldiers.
The 11th Airborne Division was ordered to breach the Genko Line and drive into Manila, where it would link up with other American forces attacking the city from the north. All three regiments were committed to the assault. During the advance on Manila, the division&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Colonel Irvin R. Schimmelpfennig III, was killed by Japanese small arms fire on 4 February and posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Spearheading the division&#x27;s attack on 5 February, the 511th overcame fierce resistance and broke the crust of the Japanese position, but was soon relieved by the 188th. As the glider regiment took up the push westwards in the face of heavy opposition, the 511th changed their axis of advance and attempted to move into the city from the south. 

By 11 February, the division had penetrated as far as Nichols Field, an airfield that formed the center of the Genko Line. This was heavily fortified with a number of entrenched naval guns and a series of bunkers; after a short artillery bombardment on the morning of 12 February, the 187th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion attacked the airfield&#x27;s north-west corner while the 1st Battalion and the entire 188th regiment moved in from the south and south-eastern corners. This pincer movement succeeded in taking the airfield and, despite a local counter-attack, by nightfall the position was secured. The following day the division thrust towards Fort William McKinley, the headquarters of Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi, commander of the Japanese defenders on Luzon. During this advance Private First Class Manuel Perez Jr. neutralized several Japanese bunkers which were impeding the division&#x27;s progress, capturing one single-handedly and killing eighteen Japanese soldiers. Perez was killed by a sniper a month later in South Luzon, and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

On 15 February, the 1st Battalion of the 187th, alongside other American units, launched an attack on Mabato Point. This was an extremely heavily fortified position featuring the same defensive measures as the Genko Line, and it would take six days of hard fighting, multiple airstrikes, and the frequent use of napalm and heavy artillery, before the point was secured. Meanwhile, having taken heavy casualties on its approach to Fort McKinley—particularly when the Japanese detonated a quantity of buried naval depth charges—on 17 February the rest of the 11th Airborne Division assaulted the fort. The 511th led the break-in, and by 18 February the area had been cleared of its defenders. Sporadic fighting continued in Manila until 3 March, when all organized Japanese resistance ended. The commander of the 511th, Colonel Orin D. &quot;Hard Rock&quot; Haugen, died of shrapnel wounds sustained during the battle of Manila on 22 February.

===Raid at Los Baños===

A large number of civilian prisoners had been detained by the Japanese on Luzon, mostly in internment camps scattered throughout the island. The largest of these was located on the campus of the Agricultural College of the Philippines at Los Baños, some south-east of Manila. General Douglas MacArthur had tasked the 11th Airborne Division with rescuing the Los Baños internees on 3 February, but the division&#x27;s ongoing combat operations around the Genko Line left it unable to divert any resources at that time. All that could be accomplished during February was to gather information, primarily through liaison with the guerilla groups operating in Southern Luzon and around Los Baños. Swing and his command staff were briefed daily by the officer working with the guerilla groups, Major Vanderpool. From the guerillas and a few civilians that had escaped the camp, Vanderpool established that it was surrounded by two barbed-wire fences approximately six feet tall. Several guard towers and bunkers dotted its perimeter, each containing at least two guards. Prisoners left each morning under armed guard to gather food supplies and firewood from a nearby town. Vanderpool was informed that the camp&#x27;s population consisted of American civilians in three distinct groups: Protestant missionaries and their families; Roman Catholic nuns and priests; and professional workers such as doctors and engineers, and their families. The latter group included several hundred women and children. While all the inmates appeared to be in good health, many had become weak from food rationing.

On 20 February, Swing was finally able to release sufficient troops for a raid on the Los Baños camp, and a four-phase plan was devised by Vanderpool and the divisional staff officers. The divisional reconnaissance platoon would travel across a nearby lake and move to the outskirts of the camp, securing a large adjacent field as the drop zone for a company of paratroopers. Having landed, the paratroopers would eliminate Japanese resistance in the area, secure the camp, and prepare for its evacuation. Fifty-four amphibious Amtracs would transport two additional companies of paratroopers to the lake shore, where a beachhead would be established while the Amtracs continued to the camp to evacuate its occupants. Simultaneously, a task force consisting of a reinforced infantry battalion, two battalions of heavy artillery and a tank destroyer battalion would advance down Highway 1 towards Los Baños to interdict any Japanese attempts to interfere.
Assisted by a group of guerrillas, on the night of 21 February the divisional reconnaissance platoon made their way to the lake and collected ten canoes. Despite navigational difficulties, the platoon came ashore near Los Baños at 02:00 the following morning, and after securing the paratroopers&#x27; drop zone, concealed themselves in the jungle near the camp. During the afternoon B Company of the 1st Battalion, 511th PIR was transferred to the airfield from which they would be deployed, while the rest of the battalion rendezvoused with the Amtrac convoy. At 07:00 on the morning of 23 February, B Company took off in ten C-47s, arriving over their drop zone shortly afterwards. As the first paratroopers landed, the reconnaissance platoon and the supporting guerilla fighters opened fire on the camp&#x27;s defences, using bazooka rounds to penetrate the concrete pillboxes, and then entered the camp to engage its garrison. The paratroopers soon joined the battle, and by 07:30 the Japanese guards had been overcome and the internees were being rounded up and readied for evacuation. At the lakeshore the 511th&#x27;s other two companies had secured their beachhead, and the convoy of Amtracs reached the camp without incident. Priority during loading was given to the women, children and wounded; some of the able-bodied men walked alongside the Amtracs as they returned to the beach. The first evacuation convoy left the camp at approximately 10:00, with B Company, the reconnaissance platoon and the guerrillas remaining behind to provide a rearguard. By 11:30 all of the civilians had been evacuated, and at 13:00 the Amtrac convoy returned for the rearguard, with the last paratroopers leaving the beach at approximately 15:00. Meanwhile, on Highway 1, the taskforce that had been deployed to protect the operation met heavy Japanese resistance and suffered several casualties, but was able to block Japanese forces that advanced on the camp, before retreating back to American lines. The raid had been a complete success, liberating 2,147 civilians.

===Southern Luzon and Aparri===
On the day that the Los Baños internees were freed, the headquarters of Sixth United States Army assigned the 11th Airborne Division the task of destroying all Japanese formations in southern Luzon, south of Manila. The bulk of the division moved south the following day, with the 187th GIR and the 511th PIR advancing abreast. The 188th GIR was detached from the main advance by Swing; it was to eliminate all Japanese units still operating in the Pico de Loro hills along the southern shore of Manila Bay. These forces belonged to the 80,000-strong &quot;Shimbu&quot; Group, one of three groups of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army under General Tomoyuki Yamashita. It would take until the end of April for the 11th Airborne Division—often acting in conjunction with Filipino soldiers, the recognized guerillas and elements of the 1st Cavalry Division—to subdue the &quot;Shimbu&quot; Group. Conducting combat operations was extremely difficult in the mountainous terrain, and many Japanese units elected to fight to the death rather than surrender. However, all organized resistance in southern Luzon ended on 1 May, when the division captured Mount Malepunyo near the city of Lipa. The 11th Airborne established a base centered around the former Japanese airstrip on the outskirts of Lipa, the runway of which was lengthened by the 127th Airborne Engineer Battalion to accommodate C-47s. Once the engineering work was completed, the division&#x27;s combat troops participated in several refresher-training courses.
The 11th Airborne&#x27;s next operation took place on 23 June in the province of Aparri in northern Luzon. By this time the only Japanese forces remaining on the island were positioned to the far north and belonged to the 52,000-strong &quot;Shobu&quot; Group. This last of General Yamashita&#x27;s three groups proved to be the most tenacious, forcing Lieutenant-General Walter Krueger, commander of the Sixth United States Army, to commit four infantry divisions, an armored task force and a large band of the Filipino recognized guerrillas. While these forces pinned down the Japanese, the 37th Infantry Division began an advance northwards, defeating a weaker formation and encircling the main Japanese force. To ensure the success of the 37th&#x27;s drive, Krueger called for an airborne force to land near Aparri and move southwards to meet the advancing 37th.

The 11th Airborne Division was to drop a battalion-sized combat team on Camalaniugan Airfield, approximately south of Aparri. It would then advance southwards, eliminating all Japanese resistance, until it linked up with the leading elements of the 37th Infantry Division. To accomplish this Swing formed a special unit–Gypsy Task Force–comprising the 1st Battalion of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment, G and I Companies of the regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, an artillery battery from the 457th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, and a platoon of engineers and miscellaneous signal and medical detachments. Gypsy Task Force would be transported by 54 C-47s and 13 C-46s aircraft, as well as six Waco CG-4A Gliders which would land jeeps and supplies for the task force. On 21 June, a detachment of pathfinders from the division was flown in to secure Camalaniugan Airfield, and two days later the transport aircraft carrying the troops of Gypsy Task Force were escorted by fighters to the area. At 09:00 the pathfinder detachment set off colored smoke to mark the drop-zone, but fierce winds and uneven ground around the airfield proved hazardous to the parachutists, causing two deaths and seventy injuries during the drop. Despite these casualties the force was rapidly concentrated, and began its advance southwards. Japanese resistance was stiff, forcing the airborne troops to rely on flamethrowers to eliminate bunkers and fortifications along their route. After three days of fighting and having eliminated a significant portion of &quot;Shobu&quot; Group, the task force encountered the lead elements of the 37th Infantry Division. Although &quot;Shobu&quot; Group would continue its resistance until September, its encirclement marked the 11th Airborne Division&#x27;s final combat operation of the war.

==Post-World War II==
===Occupation of Japan===
MacArthur made plans to use the 11th Airborne Division in the invasion of Japan; it was to remain as Sixth Army&#x27;s operational reserve, to be committed if required. However, with the end of hostilities in the Pacific Theater due to the surrender of Japan, the division was instead selected by MacArthur to lead the American forces that would occupy Japan. The divisional staff received orders to this effect on 11 August 1945, and the division was transported to Okinawa on 12 August; an operation that involved 99 B-24 Liberator bombers, 350 C-46s and 150 C-47s to airlift 11,100 men, 120 vehicles and approximately 1.16 million pounds (530,000 kg) of equipment. The 11th Airborne remained on Okinawa for several weeks before, on 28 August, it was ordered to land at Atsugi Airfield outside of Yokohama, on the main Japanese home island of Honshū. Its instructions were to secure the surrounding area, evacuate all Japanese civilians and military personnel within a radius of , and finally occupy Yokohama itself. A large number of C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft were made available, with the first—carrying Swing and his divisional staff—landing at Atsugi Airfield at 06:00 on 30 August. It took a week to fully assemble the division, and by 13 September it had been joined by the 27th Infantry Division, which was airlifted into Japan at the same time. The 11th Airborne Division was later moved from Yokohama to northern Japan, and established camps along the coast of Honshu and on the island of Hokkaido.

Occupation duties in Japan continued until May 1949, when the 11th Airborne was relieved and recalled to the United States. The division was transferred to Camp Campbell in Kentucky and remained a combat formation ready to deploy worldwide. During the early 1950s, the Angels conducted several large scale training operations in Alaska, such as Exercise Snowbird. Angels descended near Denali on the first day from C-119s over the arctic region. Inactivated at Camp Anza, California, in December 1945, it was reactivated and redesignated as the 503rd Airborne Infantry Regiment in February 1951 and assigned to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, following the departure of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment to Korea as a separate airborne regimental combat team. In 1956 the 503rd went with the rest of the 11th Airborne Division to posts in southeastern Germany.

===Korean War===

Training continued until the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. For service in Korea, the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment—now renamed the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment—and the 674th Airborne Field Artillery Battalion were detached from the division and re-formed as a separate Regimental Combat Team (RCT). The 187th made successful combat parachute assaults near the towns of Sukchon and Sunchon, north of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, as part of the Battle of Yongju. The published purpose of that drop was to capture members of the North Korean Government fleeing Pyongyang and also to free American POWs being moved towards the Chinese border, however, neither objective was realized. The regiment later fought against North Korean and Chinese forces at Suan, Wonju, Kaesong, Munsan-ni, and Inje. During the winter of 1950, the 187th was caught up in the Chinese &quot;Second Phase Offensive&quot; and fought in the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River. The 187th led the last parachute assault in Korea on 23 March 1951 as part of Operation Tomahawk and took part in the UN May–June 1951 counteroffensive. It redeployed to Japan on 26 June 1951 where it became a strategic reserve but returned to Korea on 24 May 1952 to assist in the suppression of the prisoner rebellion at the Geoje POW Camp, where prisoners had forcibly seized and held Brigadier General Francis Dodd, camp commandant, hostage for four days from 7 May 1952. After this, it once more returned to Japan on 18 October 1952 and made its final return to Korea on 22 June 1953. The unit returned to the United States in July 1955.

Four members of the 187th were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Korean War: Corporal Lester Hammond, Jr.(KIA), Corporal Rodolfo P. Hernandez(WIA), Corporal Joe R. Baldonado(KIA) and Private First Class Richard G. Wilson(KIA).

===Operation Gyroscope and First inactivation===
The 11th Airborne Division was sent to Germany in early 1956 as part of Operation Gyroscope, to replace the 5th Infantry Division stationed in Augsburg and Munich. As the division was en route, the 187th RCT was relocated to Fort Campbell, taking over the camps that the 11th had recently vacated. In July that year the 187th, along with the 508th ARC, was transferred to the newly reactivated 101st Airborne Division.

As the American Army began to restructure its organization (known as the Pentomic Concept), the battalions of the 187th were reorganized as Airborne Battle Groups. In early 1957 the lineage of Company A, 187th AIR was redesignated as HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry and administratively transferred (less personnel and equipment) to Augsburg to join its former parent formation, where it was formed from the existing personnel and equipment of the 11th Airborne Division. HHC, 2d Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry, formed from the lineage of Company B, 187th AIR remained with the 101st until 1964 while the 3d Battalion was inactivated. The 11th Division was itself inactivated in Augsburg on 1 July 1958, being reorganized and reflagged as the 24th Infantry Division. The 1st ABG, 187th Infantry and the 1st ABG, 503d Infantry, retained their Airborne designations and jump status within the 24th until both groups rotated back to the US for assignment to the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC.

===11th Air Assault Division (Test) ===
In 1960, Lt. General Gordon B. Rogers chaired the Army Aircraft Requirements Review Board. It recommended selection of the UH-1 Huey and CH-47 Chinook helicopters as primary airlift capability for the U.S. Army. The board also recommended that an operational use study be considered and mentioned the possibility of creating a unit to test operational concepts. Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara selected Lt. Gen. Hamilton H. Howze, the Army&#x27;s first director of aviation, to implement the study. McNamara handpicked the board members and prevented Secretary of the Army Elvis Jacob Stahr Jr., in what many considered a slap in the face, from nominating anyone.

The Howze Board released its findings on August 20, 1962. It proposed huge changes in Army doctrine:

To test the concept of helicopter assault, the 11th Airborne Division was reactivated at Fort Benning on 1 February 1963 and redesignated as the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) as a unit of the Regular Army. The 10th Air Transport Brigade was formed around an existing aviation battalion at Fort Benning to manage and fly the helicopters assigned to the division. The 11th Aviation Group was created, consisting of the 227th, 228th, and 229th Aviation Battalions. Elements of its original combat units, the 187th Infantry, the 188th Infantry and the 511th Infantry, were reformed under the new division. The group also included the 11th Aviation Company (General Support), 17th Aviation Company (Airmobile Light), and 478th Aviation Company (Heavy Helicopter).

Under the leadership of Major General Charles W. G. Rich, the Test Director, and Brigadier General Harry W. O. Kinnard, the Division Commander, the group developed an organizational structure and plans for a unit that could move one-third of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions and supporting units in one single helicopter lift.

The 11th Air Assault Division developed and refined air assault tactics and the equipment required to operate effectively in the role. The 187th and 188th tested helicopters during various exercises, ranging from command and control maneuvers to scouting, screening and aerial resupply, to assess their ability to perform as combat aircraft. In September 1963, Air Assault I exercises tested the Airmobility concept at the battalion level at Fort Stewart in Georgia. Air Assault II, a much larger exercise, was conducted across two states in October 1964. The 11th Air Assault Division operated against the 82nd Airborne Division and the 11th thoroughly dominated the exercise. The 11th was not constituted as a full division during the test period. Although the intent was to create three air assault brigades, the test division included an air assault brigade (which was also parachute-qualified), an airmobile brigade, and both ground and a new air artillery element provided by helicopters known as aerial rocket artillery (ARA).

When the test was concluded, the assets of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test), the 10th Air Transport Brigade, and the 2nd Infantry Division were merged into a single unit. On 29 June 1965, the colors and subordinate unit designations of the 1st Cavalry Division were transferred from its post in Korea to Fort Benning. On 3 July 1965, the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) was inactivated and its colors cased. The 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) colors were moved onto the field at Doughboy Stadium and passed to the commander of the former 11th Air Assault Division, Major General Kinnard. At the same time the personnel and units of the 1st Cavalry Division that remained in Korea were reflagged as a new 2nd Infantry Division. On 29 July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) to Vietnam.
===Air Assault Badge===

An earlier predecessor to the current Air Assault Badge, the original Air Assault Badge was worn by troops of 11th who qualified for it by making three helicopter rappels from and three from . Soldiers were also required to be knowledgeable of aircraft safety procedures; familiar with aircraft orientation; proficient in hand and arm signals and combat assault operations; able to prepare, inspect and rig equipment for external sling loads; and able to lash down equipment inside helicopters. The badge was first awarded in early 1964 and was authorized for wear by soldiers within the 11th Air Assault Division (Test).
== Twenty-first century ==


In May 2022, during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville announced that U.S. Army Alaska would be reflagged as the 11th Airborne Division. According to Wormuth and McConville, the goals of the redesignation are to give the Alaska-based forces a better sense of purpose and identity during a time of a spike in suicides. The redesignation is also meant to give a focus to the Army&#x27;s Arctic strategy. U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska said &quot;This is a historic development for our Alaska-based military, redesignating U.S. Army Alaska under the 11th Airborne Division banner presents a dual opportunity for our country—renewing the spirit and purpose of our Alaska-based soldiers by connecting them with this division&#x27;s proud and storied history, and better fulfilling America&#x27;s role as an Arctic nation.&quot; Major General Brian S. Eifler, the first 11th Airborne Division commanding general since reactivation, shared with the press the basic outline of the division stating, &quot;There&#x27;s no other formation that&#x27;s going to look like it, nor have the same mission.&quot;

On June 6, 2022, during separate ceremonies, the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team and 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division were reflagged to the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team and 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 11th Airborne Division respectively. All units from the former U.S. Army Alaska were absorbed under the new division. It was also announced that the 1st Infantry Brigade would divest its Strykers. Following these changes, the brigade would test several new vehicles to include the Cold-Weather All-Terrain Vehicle (CATV) to replace the former Strykers. The division&#x27;s 2nd Brigade would remain largely unchanged.

According to MG Eifler, the division will take time to be fully realized, but force structure currently consists of the following units:

 11th Airborne Division &quot;Arctic Angels&quot;
* Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion
** Headquarters and Support Company (Division)
** Signal Intelligence and Sustainment Company (Division)

Along with the reactivation of the 11th Airborne Division, on 25 April 2022 the G-1 of the U.S. Army authorized the wear of the Arctic Tab by soldiers assigned to organizations in Alaska as a temporary wear tab with specific SSIs. This means 11th Airborne Division soldiers will be the first U.S. Army unit to be authorized two unit designation tabs with their SSI, the Airborne Tab and Arctic Tab.

<doc id="441926" wikidata="Q76479" url="?curid=441926" title="A Fistful of Dollars">
<text>A Fistful of Dollars () is a 1964 spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood in his first leading role, alongside Gian Maria Volonté, Marianne Koch, Wolfgang Lukschy, Sieghardt Rupp, José Calvo, Antonio Prieto and Joseph Egger. The film, an international co-production between Italy, West Germany and Spain, was filmed on a low budget (reported to be $200,000), and Eastwood was paid $15,000 for his role.

Released in Italy in 1964 and in the United States in 1967, the film initiated the popularity of the spaghetti Western genre. It is considered a landmark in cinema and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. It was followed by &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, both also starring Eastwood. Collectively, the films are known as the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, or the &quot;Man with No Name Trilogy&quot;, after the United Artists publicity campaign referred to Eastwood&#x27;s character in all three films as the &quot;Man with No Name&quot;. All three films were released in sequence in the United States in 1967, catapulting Eastwood into stardom.

The film has been identified as an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film, &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961), which resulted in a successful lawsuit by Toho, &quot;Yojimbo&quot;″s production company. Kurosawa wrote to Leone directly, saying, &quot;Signor Leone, I have just had the chance to see your film. It is a very fine film, but it is my film. Since Japan is a signatory of the Berne Convention on the international copyright, you must pay me.&quot; He and Toho received 15% of the film&#x27;s revenue, and it is believed that Kurosawa earned more money from the financial settlement than he had made on his own film, &quot;Yojimbo.&quot;

Few spaghetti Westerns had been released in the United States at the time, so many of the European cast and crew adopted American-sounding stage names. These included Leone (&quot;Bob Robertson&quot;), Gian Maria Volonté (&quot;Johnny Wels&quot;) and composer Ennio Morricone (&quot;Dan Savio&quot;). &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both in the province of Almería.

==Plot==
An unnamed stranger arrives at the little town of San Miguel, on the Mexico–United States border. Silvanito, the town&#x27;s innkeeper, tells the Stranger about a feud between two smuggler families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers 
— Don Miguel, Esteban and Ramón — and the family of the town sheriff, John Baxter; his matriarchal wife, Consuelo; and their son, Antonio. To make money, the Stranger decides to play these families against each other. He demonstrates his deadliness to both sides by shooting the four men who insulted him as he entered town with ease.

The Stranger witnesses the Rojos massacre a detachment of Mexican soldiers escorting a chest of gold (to exchange for rifles) and comes up with a plan. He takes two of the dead bodies to a nearby cemetery and props them up to make them appear alive. He sells information to both factions, claiming two Mexican soldiers survived the attack. Each faction races to the cemetery, the Baxters to get the supposed survivors to testify against the Rojos, and the Rojos to silence them. They engage in a gunfight, with Ramón &quot;killing&quot; the supposed survivors and Esteban capturing Antonio Baxter.

While the Rojos and the Baxters are fighting, the Stranger searches the Rojo hacienda for the gold, and accidentally knocks out a woman, Marisol. He takes her to the Baxters, who arrange to return her to the Rojos in exchange for Antonio. During the hostage exchange, Marisol&#x27;s son and husband approach her. Ramón orders one of his men, Rubio, to kill Marisol&#x27;s husband, Julio, but he is deterred by Silvanito and the Stranger. The Stranger orders Marisol to go back to Ramón, and her husband to take their son home. He learns from Silvanito that Ramón accused Julio of cheating during a card game and took Marisol as collateral.

That night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the Stranger kills the guards, frees Marisol, and wrecks the house where she was held to create the appearance of an attack by the Baxters. He gives money to Marisol and urges her family to leave town.

The Rojos eventually discover that it was the Stranger who freed Marisol. They capture and torture him, but he escapes. Believing that he is protected by the Baxters, the Rojos set fire to the Baxter home, massacring everyone, including the Baxter’s wife, as they flee the burning building. With help from the local coffinmaker named Piripero, the Stranger escapes town by hiding in a coffin, and recuperates in an abandoned mine.

When Piripero tells him that Silvanito has been captured and tortured by the Rojos for the Stranger&#x27;s whereabouts, he returns to town to confront them. With a steel chest plate hidden beneath his poncho, he taunts Ramón to &quot;aim for the heart&quot; as Ramón&#x27;s shots deflect until Ramón exhausts his Winchester rifle&#x27;s ammunition. The Stranger shoots the weapon from Ramón&#x27;s hand and kills Don Miguel, Rubio and the other Rojo men standing nearby. He uses the last shot to free Silvanito, who is hanging from a rope by his hands.

After challenging Ramón to reload his rifle faster than he can reload his revolver, the Stranger shoots and kills him. Esteban Rojo aims for the Stranger&#x27;s back from a nearby building, but is shot dead by Silvanito. The Stranger bids Silvanito and Piripero farewell, and rides away from town.

==Cast==
Additional cast members include Antonio Moreno as Juan De Dios, Enrique Santiago as Fausto, Umberto Spadaro as Miguel, Fernando Sánchez Polack as Vicente, and José Riesgo as the Mexican cavalry captain. Members of the Baxter gang include Luis Barboo, Frank Braña, Antonio Molino Rojo, Lorenzo Robledo and William R. Thompkins. Members of the Rojo gang include José Canalejas, Álvaro de Luna, Nazzareno Natale and Antonio Pica.

==Development==
&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was originally called &quot;Il Magnifico Straniero&quot; (&quot;The Magnificent Stranger&quot;), before the title was changed to &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;.

The production and development of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, from anecdotes, was described by Italian film historian, Roberto Curti, as both contradictory and difficult to decipher. Tonino Valerii alternatively said that Barboni and Stelvio Massi met Leone outside a theater in Rome where they had seen &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, suggesting to Leone that it would make a good Western. Actor and friend of Leone, Mimmo Palmara, told a similar story to Valerii, saying that Barboni had told him about &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, and he would see it the next day with Leone and his wife, Carla.

Adriano Bolzoni stated in 1978 that he had the idea of making &quot;Yojimbo&quot; into a Western, and brought the idea to Franco Palaggi, who sent Bolzoni with Duccio Tessari to watch the film and take notes on it. Bolzoni said that both he and Tessari wrote a first draft, which moved on to Leone, noting that Tessari wrote the majority of the script.

Fernando di Leo also claimed authorship of the script, saying that both &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; were written by him and Tessari, and not Luciano Vincenzoni. Di Leo claimed that after Leone had the idea for the film, Tessari wrote the script and he gave him a hand. Di Leo would repeat this story in an interview, saying that he was at the first meetings of Tessari and Leone discussing what kind of film to make from &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. Di Leo noted that Leone did not like the first draft of the script, which led to him to drastically rewrite it with Tessari. Production papers for the film credit Spanish and German writers, but these were added to play into coproduction standards during this period of filmmaking, to get more financing from the Spanish and West German companies. Leone would suggest that he wrote the entire screenplay, based on Tessari&#x27;s treatment.

Originally, Sergio Leone intended Henry Fonda to play the &quot;Man with No Name&quot;. However, the production company could not afford to employ a major Hollywood star. Next, Leone offered the part to Charles Bronson. He, too, declined, arguing that the script was bad. Both Fonda and Bronson would eventually star in Leone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. Other actors who turned down the role were Henry Silva, Rory Calhoun, Tony Russel, Steve Reeves, Ty Hardin and James Coburn. Leone said he wanted Coburn for the role, but he was deemed too expensive. Leone turned his attention to Richard Harrison, an expatriate American actor who had recently starred in the Italian Western, &quot;Duello nel Texas&quot;. Harrison, however, had not been impressed with his experience in that film, and refused. The producers presented a list of available, lesser-known American actors and asked Harrison for advice. Harrison suggested Eastwood, who he knew could play a cowboy convincingly. Harrison would state, &quot;Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and recommending Clint for the part.&quot; Eastwood would speak about transitioning from a television Western to &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;: &quot;In &quot;Rawhide,&quot; I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat... the hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an antihero.&quot;

Eastwood said that he had a similar idea for adapting &quot;Yojimbo&quot; into a Western a few years earlier in Los Angeles, when a friend who was a fan of samurai cinema took him to watch &quot;Yojimbo&quot; at a Western Avenue theater that ran Japanese films. Eastwood recalled that he &quot;remembered sitting there&quot; and saying, &quot;Boy, this would be a great western if only someone had nerve enough to do it, but they&#x27;d never have enough nerve.&quot; A few years later, after someone handed him the script for &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, &quot;about five or 10 pages in&quot; he &quot;recognized it as an obvious rip-off&quot; of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, which he found ironic.

&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was an Italian, German and Spanish coproduction, so there was a significant language barrier on set. Leone did not speak English, and Eastwood communicated with the Italian cast and crew mostly through actor and stuntman, Benito Stefanelli, who also acted as an uncredited interpreter for the production, and would later appear in Leone&#x27;s other pictures. Similar to other Italian films shot at the time, all footage was filmed silent, and the dialogue and sound effects were dubbed in post-production. For the Italian version of the film, Eastwood was dubbed by stage and screen actor, Enrico Maria Salerno, whose sinister rendition of the Man with No Name&#x27;s voice contrasted with Eastwood&#x27;s cocksure and darkly humorous interpretation.

==Visual style==
&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; became the first film to exhibit Leone&#x27;s distinctive style of visual direction. This was influenced by both John Ford&#x27;s cinematic landscaping and the Japanese method of direction honed by Akira Kurosawa. Leone wanted an operatic feel to his Western, so there are many examples of extreme closeups of the faces of different characters, functioning like arias in a traditional opera. The rhythm, emotion and communication within scenes can be attributed to Leone&#x27;s meticulous framing of his closeups. Leone&#x27;s closeups are akin to portraits, often lit with Renaissance-type lighting effects, and are considered by some as pieces of design in their own right.

Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name&#x27;s distinctive visual style. He bought black jeans from a sports shop on Hollywood Boulevard; the hat came from a Santa Monica wardrobe firm; and the trademark cigars from a Beverly Hills store. He also brought props from &quot;Rawhide&quot;, including a Cobra-handled Colt, a gunbelt and spurs. The poncho was acquired in Spain. It was Leone and costume designer, Carlo Simi, who decided on the Spanish poncho for the Man with No Name. On the DVD commentary for &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, it is said that although Eastwood is a nonsmoker, he felt that the foul taste of the cigar in his mouth put him in the right frame of mind for his character. Leone reportedly took quickly to Eastwood&#x27;s distinctive style, and commented, &quot;More than an actor, I needed a mask, and Eastwood, at that time, only had two expressions: with hat and no hat.&quot;

===Title design===
Iginio Lardani created the film&#x27;s title design.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s music was written by Ennio Morricone, initially credited as Dan Savio.

Leone requested Morricone to write a theme that would be similar to Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s &quot;El Degüello&quot; (used in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;). Although the two themes are similar, Morricone stated that he used a lullaby that he had composed previously, and developed the theme from that. He added that what makes the two themes similar is the execution, not the arrangement.

In 1962, expatriate American folk singer Peter Tevis, recorded a version of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot; that was arranged by Morricone. During a conference with Morricone discussing the music in the film, a recording of Tevis&#x27;s &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot; was played. Sergio Leone said, &quot;That&#x27;s it&quot;, with Tevis claiming that the tune and musical arrangements were copied for the music for the opening title, &quot;Titoli&quot;.

&quot;Some of the music was written before the film, which is unusual,&quot; said Morricone. &quot;Leone&#x27;s films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it, and he often kept the scenes longer simply because he didn&#x27;t want the music to end. That&#x27;s why the films are so slow — because of the music.&quot;

Although not used in the completed film, Peter Tevis recorded lyrics to Morricone&#x27;s main theme for the film. As a movie tie-in to the American release, United Artists Records released a different set of lyrics to Morricone&#x27;s theme, called &quot;Restless One&quot;, and recorded by Little Anthony and the Imperials.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
Promoting &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was difficult, because no major distributor wanted to take a chance on a faux-Western and an unknown director. The film ended up being released in Italy 12 September 1964, which was typically the worst month for sales.

Despite the initial negative reviews from Italian critics, the film&#x27;s popularity spread at a grassroots level, and, over the film&#x27;s theatrical release, it grossed 2.7 billion lire () in Italy, more than any other Italian film to that point. It sold admissions of 14,797,275 ticket sales in Italy. The film also sold 4,383,331 tickets in France and 3,281,990 tickets in Spain, earning a total of more than US grossed in international territories outside Italy and North America, and tickets sold in Europe.

The release of the film was delayed in the United States, because distributors feared being sued by Kurosawa. As a result, it was not shown in American cinemas until 18 January 1967. The film grossed $4.5 million for the year. In 1969, it was rereleased, earning $1.2 million in theatrical rentals. It eventually grossed $14.5 million in the United States and Canada, totaling more than grossed worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film was initially shunned by Italian critics, who gave it extremely negative reviews. Some American critics felt differently from their Italian counterparts, with &quot;Variety&quot; praising it as having &quot;a James Bondian vigor and tongue-in-cheek approach that was sure to capture both sophisticates and average cinema patrons&quot;.

On the film&#x27;s American release in 1967, both Philip French and Bosley Crowther were unimpressed with the film itself. Critic Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; stated: The calculated sadism of the film would be offensive were it not for the neutralizing laughter aroused by the ludicrousness of the whole exercise. If one didn&#x27;t know the actual provenance of the film, one would guess that it was a private movie made by a group of rich European Western fans at a dude ranch... &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; looks awful, has a flat dead soundtrack, and is totally devoid of human feeling.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; treated the film not as pastiche, but as camp-parody, stating that nearly every Western cliché could be found in this &quot;egregiously synthetic but engrossingly morbid, violent film&quot;. He went on to patronize Eastwood&#x27;s performance, stating: &quot;He is simply another fabrication of a personality, half cowboy and half gangster, going through the ritualistic postures and exercises of each... He is a morbid, amusing, campy fraud.&quot;

When the film was televised on the ABC network 23 February 1975, a four-and-a-half-minute prologue was added to the film to contextualize the character and justify the violence. Written and directed by Monte Hellman, it featured an unidentified official (Harry Dean Stanton) offering the Man With No Name a chance at a pardon in exchange for cleaning up the mess in San Miguel. Closeups of Eastwood&#x27;s face from archival footage are inserted into the scene alongside Stanton&#x27;s performance. This prologue opened television presentations for a few years before disappearing; it reappeared on the Special Edition DVD and the more recent Blu-ray, along with an interview with Monte Hellman about its production.

The retrospective reception of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; has been much more positive, noting it as a hugely influential film in regard to the rejuvenation of the Western genre. Film historian Howard Hughes, in his 2012 book, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Italian West&quot;, reflected by stating, &quot;American and British critics largely chose to ignore Fistful&#x27;s release, few recognizing its satirical humor or groundbreaking style, preferring to trash the shoddy production values...&quot;

&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; has achieved a 98% approval rating from 55 critical reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; as his template, Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; helped define a new era for the Western and usher in its most iconic star, Clint Eastwood.&quot; It has also placed at number 8 on the site&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Westerns&quot;.

The 67th Cannes Film Festival, held in 2014, celebrated the &quot;50th anniversary of the birth of the spaghetti Western... by showing &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;&quot;. Quentin Tarantino, in a press release prior to hosting the event, described the film as &quot;the greatest achievement in the history of cinema&quot;.

==Legal dispute==
The film was effectively an unofficial and unlicensed remake of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1961 film, &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (written by Kurosawa and Ryūzō Kikushima); Kurosawa insisted that Leone had made &quot;a fine movie, but it was &quot;my&quot; movie&quot;. This led to a lawsuit from Toho, &quot;Yojimbo&quot;″s production company. Leone ignored the resulting lawsuit, but eventually settled out of court, reportedly for 15% of the worldwide receipts of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and over $100,000.

British critic Sir Christopher Frayling, identifies three principal sources for &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;: &quot;Partly derived from Kurosawa&#x27;s samurai film &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, partly from Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot; (1929), but most of all from Carlo Goldoni&#x27;s eighteenth-century play &quot;Servant of Two Masters&quot;.&quot; Leone cited those alternate sources in his defense. He claimed a thematic debt, for both &quot;Fistful&quot; and &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, to Carlo Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;Servant of Two Masters —&quot; the basic premise of the protagonist playing two camps against each other. Leone asserted that this rooted the origination of &quot;Fistful&quot;/&quot;Yojimbo&quot; in European, and specifically, Italian, culture. The &quot;Servant of Two Masters&quot;&#x27;s plot can also be seen in Hammett&#x27;s detective novel, &quot;Red Harvest.&quot; The Continental Op hero of the novel is, significantly, a &quot;man without a name.&quot; Leone believed that &quot;Red Harvest&quot; had influenced &quot;Yojimbo&quot;: &quot;Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; was inspired by an American novel of the series-noire so I was really taking the story back home again.&quot;

Leone also referenced numerous American Westerns in the film, most notably &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;, both of which differ from &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

==Digital restoration==
In 2014, the film was digitally restored by Cineteca di Bologna and Unidis Jolly Film for its Blu-ray debut and 50th anniversary. Frame-by-frame digital restoration by Prasad Corporation removed dirt, tears, scratches and other defects. The directorial credit for Leone, which replaced the &quot;Bob Robertson&quot; card years ago, has been retained, but otherwise, the original credits (with pseudonyms, including &quot;Dan Savio&quot; for Morricone) remain the same.

== Legacy ==
=== Remakes ===
In 2020, Deadline reported a television version by Mark Gordon was in the works.

In 2024, Deadline reported a movie remake with the original production company behind it was in the works.

<text>Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.

One of the best-known techniques has been credited to Moni Naor and Adi Shamir, who developed it in 1994. They demonstrated a visual secret sharing scheme, where a binary image was broken up into &quot;n&quot; shares so that only someone with all &quot;n&quot; shares could decrypt the image, while any shares revealed no information about the original image. Each share was printed on a separate transparency, and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares. When all &quot;n&quot; shares were overlaid, the original image would appear. There are several generalizations of the basic scheme including &quot;k&quot;-out-of-&quot;n&quot; visual cryptography, and using opaque sheets but illuminating them by multiple sets of identical illumination patterns under the recording of only one single-pixel detector.

Using a similar idea, transparencies can be used to implement a one-time pad encryption, where one transparency is a shared random pad, and another transparency acts as the ciphertext. Normally, there is an expansion of space requirement in visual cryptography. But if one of the two shares is structured recursively, the efficiency of visual cryptography can be increased to 100%.

Some antecedents of visual cryptography are in patents from the 1960s. Other antecedents are in the work on perception and secure communication.

Visual cryptography can be used to protect biometric templates in which decryption does not require any complex computations.

== Example ==
In this example, the binary image has been split into two component images. Each component image has a &quot;pair&quot; of pixels for every pixel in the original image. These pixel pairs are shaded black or white according to the following rule: if the original image pixel was black, the pixel pairs in the component images must be complementary; randomly shade one ■□, and the other □■. When these complementary pairs are overlapped, they will appear dark gray. On the other hand, if the original image pixel was white, the pixel pairs in the component images must match: both ■□ or both □■. When these matching pairs are overlapped, they will appear light gray.

So, when the two component images are superimposed, the original image appears. However, without the other component, a component image reveals no information about the original image; it is indistinguishable from a random pattern of ■□ / □■ pairs. Moreover, if you have one component image, you can use the shading rules above to produce a &quot;counterfeit&quot; component image that combines with it to produce any image at all.

== (2, &quot;n&quot;) visual cryptography sharing case ==

Sharing a secret with an arbitrary number of people, &quot;n&quot;, such that at least 2 of them are required to decode the secret is one form of the visual secret sharing scheme presented by Moni Naor and Adi Shamir in 1994. In this scheme we have a secret image which is encoded into &quot;n&quot; shares printed on transparencies. The shares appear random and contain no decipherable information about the underlying secret image, however if any 2 of the shares are stacked on top of one another the secret image becomes decipherable by the human eye.

Every pixel from the secret image is encoded into multiple subpixels in each share image using a matrix to determine the color of the pixels. 
In the (2, &quot;n&quot;) case, a white pixel in the secret image is encoded using a matrix from the following set, where each row gives the subpixel pattern for one of the components:

{all permutations of the columns of} : formula_1

While a black pixel in the secret image is encoded using a matrix from the following set:

{all permutations of the columns of} : formula_2

For instance in the (2,2) sharing case (the secret is split into 2 shares and both shares are required to decode the secret) we use complementary matrices to share a black pixel and identical matrices to share a white pixel. Stacking the shares we have all the subpixels associated with the black pixel now black while 50% of the subpixels associated with the white pixel remain white.

== Cheating the (2, &quot;n&quot;) visual secret sharing scheme ==
Horng et al. proposed a method that allows colluding parties to cheat an honest party in visual cryptography. They take advantage of knowing the underlying distribution of the pixels in the shares to create new shares that combine with existing shares to form a new secret message of the cheaters choosing.

We know that 2 shares are enough to decode the secret image using the human visual system. But examining two shares also gives some information about the 3rd share. For instance, colluding participants may examine their shares to determine when they both have black pixels and use that information to determine that another participant will also have a black pixel in that location. Knowing where black pixels exist in another party&#x27;s share allows them to create a new share that will combine with the predicted share to form a new secret message. In this way a set of colluding parties that have enough shares to access the secret code can cheat other honest parties.

== Visual steganography ==

2×2 subpixels can also encode a binary image in each component image, as in the scheme on the right. Each white pixel of each component image is represented by two black subpixels, while each black pixel is represented by three black subpixels.

When overlaid, each white pixel of the secret image is represented by three black subpixels, while each black pixel is represented by all four subpixels black. Each corresponding pixel in the component images is randomly rotated to avoid orientation leaking information about the secret image.

== In popular culture ==
* In &quot;Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling&quot;, a 1967 episode of TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, the protagonist uses a visual cryptography overlay of multiple transparencies to reveal a secret message – the location of a scientist friend who had gone into hiding.

<text>Philip Bennett (24 October 1948 – 12 June 2022) was a Welsh rugby union player who played as a fly-half for Llanelli RFC and the Wales national team. He began his career in 1966, and a year later he had taken over from Barry John as Llanelli&#x27;s first-choice fly-half. He made 414 appearances for the Scarlets over the course of a 15-year career he scored 131 tries, 43 drop goals, 293 pens and 523 convs. He made his Wales debut in 1969, but it was not until John&#x27;s retirement from rugby in 1972 that Bennett became a regular starter for his country. He led Wales to the Five Nations Championship title, including the Grand Slam in 1978, which culminated with his retirement from Wales duty.

Bennett also toured with the British Lions to South Africa in 1974, when they went unbeaten in 22 matches, and to New Zealand in 1977, and also made 20 appearances for the Barbarians between 1970 and 1980; he played a pivotal role in the win over New Zealand in 1973, considered by many to be the best rugby union match ever played.

Bennett was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2020, his try for Wales against Scotland in March 1977 was voted the greatest Wales try of all time.

==Early life==
Bennett was born in Felinfoel, Carmarthenshire, on 24 October 1948. His father, Les, worked in a local steelworks in Llanelli until he had an industrial accident, and his mother, Mary, worked at a local car-pressing plant. Bennett was often ill as a child and his father was told that he would &quot;never have the physique to play rugby&quot;. As a teenager, Bennett worked in the local steel works and was offered a trial by West Ham United as a footballer. 

==Rugby career==
===Club career===
Bennett began his rugby career with Felinfoel RFC, before being picked up by nearby Llanelli RFC. He made his debut for the Scarlets at the age of 18, starting at fly-half in an 18–9 defeat away to local rivals Swansea RFC on 12 November 1966. He made three more appearances in the 1966–67 season, all of them at full-back. Following the departure of Barry John to Cardiff RFC at the end of the season, Bennett took over as Llanelli&#x27;s first-choice fly-half, and in his first full season, they won the Western Mail Welsh Club Championship. They won that title twice more during Bennett&#x27;s time at the club, as well as reaching the final of the WRU Challenge Cup in each of its first five years, winning four in a row from 1973 to 1976. During the 1972–73 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Bennett played in the Llanelli team that beat the New Zealand &quot;All Blacks&quot; 9–3. He retired from club rugby in 1981, having made 414 appearances for Llanelli and scored 2,535 points.

He also played 20 times for the Barbarians, including against the All Blacks in January 1973. Early in the match, after a long New Zealand kick downfield, Bennett gathered the ball inside his own 25-metre area; he then beat four All Black players before passing the ball onto J. P. R. Williams. The Barbarians broke downfield, the move culminating in a try for Bennett&#x27;s half-back partner Gareth Edwards. The try is often considered to be the greatest ever scored.

===International career===
Bennett made his Wales debut against France at Stade Colombes in Paris on 22 March 1969; he came off the bench to replace an injured Gerald Davies, making him the first ever substitute for the Wales national team. Bennett&#x27;s first start came on the right wing against South Africa in January 1970, a position he was not familiar with, but he was considered &quot;too good to leave out&quot;; he then moved to inside centre for Wales&#x27; first match of the 1970 Five Nations Championship against Scotland, before making his first appearance at fly-half in the match against France two months later. He had to wait almost two years for his next appearance, coming on as a replacement for an injured J. P. R. Williams at full-back, but after Barry John&#x27;s sudden retirement from rugby in 1972, Bennett took the number 10 jersey on a permanent basis.

Bennett went on to become a member of the British and Irish Lions team on their tour to South Africa in 1974, in the team known as &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. They went on to win 21 of their 22 matches and the Test series 3–0, with just one game drawn. Bennett scored 103 points, the most of anyone on the tour. He went on to tour again with the British and Irish Lions to New Zealand in 1977, but this time as captain, where he again was top scorer with 125 points. Bennett retired from international rugby union in 1978 having won 29 caps for Wales between 1969 and 1978. This included two Five Nations Championship Grand Slams and three Triple Crowns. He was awarded an OBE in the 1978 New Year Honours for services to rugby football.

As captain of Wales, Bennett gave a pre-game team talk before a Five Nations Championship match against England on 5 March 1977:
&quot;Look what these bastards have done to Wales. They&#x27;ve taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our homes and live in them for a fortnight every year. What have they given us? Absolutely nothing. We&#x27;ve been exploited, raped, controlled and punished by the English – and that&#x27;s who you are playing this afternoon,&quot;
==Post-retirement==
After retiring, Bennett became a commentator for BBC Wales on their radio and television rugby coverage. He also had regular newspaper columns for the &quot;South Wales Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Bennett published his autobiography in 2004. In 2007, he was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame. He was named president of the Scarlets regional side in 2011. In 2015, he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame (listed at the website of the Hall of Fame as inducted in 2014). In April 2022, a statue of Bennett by local wood carver Simon Hedger was unveiled in Bennett&#x27;s home village of Felinfoel.

==Death==
Bennett died on 12 June 2022 after a long illness at the age of 73. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Bennett was &quot;one of the greatest fly-halves to play for Wales and the British and Irish Lions. World Rugby, the world governing body for rugby union, said of Bennett that he was &quot;one of the greatest to have ever played the game. Phil Bennett&#x27;s legacy and his impact are undeniable.&quot; The Welsh Rugby Union said he was &quot;a Welsh rugby legend in every sense and true gentleman&quot;.

On 19 June 2022, ahead of their match against England, the Barbarians players stood in the shape of a number 10 in honour of Bennett, and a minute&#x27;s applause was observed in the stadium. Barbarians fly-half Antoine Hastoy wore his name on the back of his shirt in red rather than grey. 

On 12 June 2023, the Scarlets announced that they would face the Barbarians in a pre-season friendly, with the match being marked as the &quot;Phil Bennett Memorial Game&quot;. A donation made up of the ticket revenue of the game would be given to the Phil Bennett Foundation, a charity founded in memory of Bennett to help raise charitable funds to help disadvantaged, disabled or underprivileged individuals to participate in sport. The match was played on the 16 September 2023 and the Scarlets won the game 33–19.

<text>Stångån is a small river in southern Sweden, 185 km long and with a drainage basin of 2440 km2. It flows from the highlands of eastern Småland in the south to lake Roxen in the north. At the outlet near Linköping, the average discharge is 15 m3 per second.

It passes through Vimmerby, Kisa, and Linköping. A great deal of the river is extended to a canal, Kinda Canal. A railway takes the same course as the river.

<doc id="441950" wikidata="Q3303153" url="?curid=441950" title="Axiom of dependent choice">
<text>In mathematics, the axiom of dependent choice, denoted by formula_1, is a weak form of the axiom of choice (formula_2) that is still sufficient to develop much of real analysis. It was introduced by Paul Bernays in a 1942 article in reverse mathematics that explores which set-theoretic axioms are needed to develop analysis.

== Formal statement ==
A homogeneous relation formula_3 on formula_4 is called a total relation if for every formula_5 there exists some formula_6 such that formula_7 is true.

The axiom of dependent choice can be stated as follows: 
For every nonempty set formula_4 and every total relation formula_3 on formula_10 there exists a sequence formula_11 in formula_4 such that 
:formula_13 for all formula_14

In fact, &quot;x&quot;0 may be taken to be any desired element of &quot;X&quot;. (To see this, apply the axiom as stated above to the set of finite sequences that start with &quot;x&quot;0 and in which subsequent terms are in relation formula_3, together with the total relation on this set of the second sequence being obtained from the first by appending a single term.)

If the set formula_4 above is restricted to be the set of all real numbers, then the resulting axiom is denoted by formula_17

== Use ==
Even without such an axiom, for any formula_18, one can use ordinary mathematical induction to form the first formula_18 terms of such a sequence.
The axiom of dependent choice says that we can form a whole (countably infinite) sequence this way.

The axiom formula_1 is the fragment of formula_2 that is required to show the existence of a sequence constructed by transfinite recursion of countable length, if it is necessary to make a choice at each step and if some of those choices cannot be made independently of previous choices.

== Equivalent statements ==
Over formula_22 (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice), formula_1 is equivalent to the Baire category theorem for complete metric spaces.

It is also equivalent over formula_22 to the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem.

formula_1 is also equivalent over formula_22 to the statement that every pruned tree with formula_27 levels has a branch (&quot;proof below&quot;).

Furthermore, formula_1 is equivalent to a weakened form of Zorn&#x27;s lemma; specifically formula_1 is equivalent to the statement that any partial order such that every well-ordered chain is finite and bounded, must have a maximal element.

== Relation with other axioms ==
Unlike full formula_2, formula_1 is insufficient to prove (given formula_22) that there is a non-measurable set of real numbers, or that there is a set of real numbers without the property of Baire or without the perfect set property. This follows because the Solovay model satisfies formula_33, and every set of real numbers in this model is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property and has the perfect set property.

The axiom of dependent choice implies the axiom of countable choice and is strictly stronger.

It is possible to generalize the axiom to produce transfinite sequences. If these are allowed to be arbitrarily long, then it becomes equivalent to the full axiom of choice.

<doc id="441960" wikidata="Q1125206" url="?curid=441960" title="Mount Pentelicus">
<text>Mount Pentelicus or Pentelikon (, or ) is a mountain in Attica, Greece, situated northeast of Athens and southwest of Marathon. Its highest point is the peak &quot;Pyrgari&quot;, with an elevation of 1,109 m. The mountain is covered in large part with forest (about 60 or 70%), and can be seen from southern Athens (Attica), the Pedia plain, Parnitha, and the southern part of the northern suburbs of Athens. Houses surround the mountain, especially in Vrilissia, Penteli, Ekali, Dionysos, and north of Gerakas. Marble from Mount Pentelicus is of exceptionally high quality and was used to construct much of the Athenian Acropolis. Later, Pentelic marble was exported to Rome, where it was used in construction and in sculptures.

In ancient times it was also called Brilessos or Brilettos (, ) which is the origin of the name of the nearby suburb of Vrilissia.

== Pentelic marble ==
Mount Pentelicus has been famous for its marble since antiquity. Pentelic marble was used for the construction of buildings in ancient Athens, particularly the Acropolis. The ancient quarry is protected by law, and used exclusively to obtain material for the Acropolis Restoration Project. The roadway used to transport marble blocks from the quarry to the Acropolis in antiquity is a continual downhill, and follows the natural lay of the land. It has been researched and fully documented by the chief Acropolis restoration architect, Professor Manolis Korres, in his award-winning book &quot;From Pentelicon to the Parthenon&quot;. A monastery is also located in the middle of the mountain, north-east of the city center.

Pentelic marble is white with a uniform, faint yellow tint, which makes it shine with a golden hue under sunlight. Pentelic marble is calcitic in composition with quartz as an accessory mineral. It is fine grained with sporadic calcitic fossil clasts. Pentelic marble is divided into 3 units distinguishable by δ13C and δ18O values. δ13C and δ18O values have been used to precisely match marbles from the Acropolis to their source quarries. The Elgin Marbles have been traced to Unit 3 using this method.

==Fires==

A fire in early July 1995 consumed much of the mountain forest, and the eastern half became residential districts of the Athens area. The volume of smoke was tremendous; it nearly covered the entire northeastern part of Athens, and all terrestrial televisual media covered the fire. The blaze lasted about five days; it reached east of Penteli about 5:30 p.m. local time, and then into the Pentelis and Vrilissia, consuming a group of houses on Friday night (about 9:00 p.m. EET, 7:00 p.m. UTC), the northern range on Saturday morning, Rhea on Saturday afternoon, Anoixi on Monday, and the Dionysus communities on Saturday. It consumed three quarters of the slopes of Mount Pentelicus, and was the worst forest fire Athens and Greece had seen in the 20th century. Housing development took place in the eastern half of the mountain which removed what was left of nature from the mountain, and streets are grid and circular. Many are luxurious and several houses were later added; a mining area also removed what was left from nature in the eastern half. The northern half remains heavily forested.

A series of fires also occurred after the major fire devastated the mountain range, from 1998 to 2001. Many of the fires were arson-related and suspects were arrested. After the major forest fire of July 1995, three years later in the area of Drafi, mudslides blocked roads as a rock clogged off a residential road; a series of mudslides also occurred several years later and devastated some homes, continuing in part to this day.

Yet again, twelve years after the major fire, flames once more encroached on the urban areas of Athens from June 30, 2007, the same day as the Parnitha fire, and a minor fire was seen northeast of Vrilissia, in which tens of houses and properties fell to the flames, along with its forests. The fire even burnt its dry grass which was the chief pattern of spread; the people of the area now favor removal of dry grass from future wildfires. The blaze burnt tens of hectares and lasted through the late afternoon to the late-night hours, and was seen as far as neighborhood streets and broader Athens. One and a half months later, a huge fire yet again battered the forests adjoining Penteli and Vrilissia. This time the wildfire was larger and more destructive, with flames towering as high as 50 to 60 m, and almost blocking any view of the sky, along with an attendant smoke. The blaze spread, burning tens or hundreds buildings, many of them near the forested areas, and a western portion 10 km long from north to south, and 4 to 5 km wide from east to west. Firefighters along with the neighborhood&#x27;s panicked residents battled the blaze on neighborhood streets, and helicopters sprayed the blaze. The fire had begun in the afternoon hours and quickly spread. One conflagration burnt trees in seconds, another extended to balconies with grills destroyed, and several roofs collapsed - the blaze lasted into the evening hours and its head burnt near the town, while Vrilissia, eastern Nea Erythraia, Ekali, and Dionyssos were also hit. Its cause, like most of the fires of 2007, was arson; a former firefighter was charged with fire-setting and has been sentenced and jailed. During the country&#x27;s worst ever fire, which broke the 1950s record on August 26, 2007, flames sparked by arson ravaged the forests of the remainder of the area around Mount Pentelicus and burnt pine, spruce and fir trees, lasting for several days; this was not the same blaze that had arrived from Keratea and Markopoulo to the south.

In July 2022 another wildfire destroyed several hectares of forest land in the eastern side of the mountain.

<doc id="441961" wikidata="Q752847" url="?curid=441961" title="Status quo ante bellum">
<text>The term status quo ante bellum is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;the situation as it existed before the war&quot;.
The term was originally used in treaties to refer to the withdrawal of enemy troops and the restoration of prewar leadership. When used as such, it means that no side gains or loses any territorial, economic, or political rights. This contrasts with &quot;uti possidetis&quot;, where each side retains whatever territory and other property it holds at the end of the war.

==Historical examples==
An early example is the treaty that ended the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 between the Eastern Roman and the Sasanian Persian Empires. The Persians had occupied Asia Minor, Palestine and Egypt. After a successful Roman counteroffensive in Mesopotamia finally ended the war, the integrity of Rome&#x27;s eastern frontier as it was prior to 602 was fully restored. Both empires were exhausted after this war, and neither was ready to defend itself when the armies of Islam emerged from Arabia in 632.

Another example is the sixteenth-century Abyssinian–Adal war between the Muslim Adal Sultanate and Christian Ethiopian Empire, which ended in a stalemate. Both empires were exhausted after this war, and neither was ready to defend itself against the Oromo Migrations.

===War of 1812===
The War of 1812 was fought between the United States and the United Kingdom, which was concluded with the Treaty of Ghent in 1814. During negotiations, British diplomats had suggested ending the war &quot;uti possidetis&quot;. While American diplomats demanded cession from Canada and British officials also pressed for a pro-British Indian barrier state in the Midwest and keeping parts of Maine they captured (i.e., New Ireland) during the war, the final treaty left neither gains nor losses in land for the United States or the United Kingdom&#x27;s Canadian colonies.

===Football War===
The Football War, also known as the Soccer War or 100 Hour War, was a brief war fought between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. It ended in a ceasefire and &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; due to intervention by the Organization of American States.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1965===
The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India. The conflict began following Pakistan&#x27;s Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. This war concluded in a stalemate with no permanent territorial changes (see Tashkent Declaration).

===Iran–Iraq War===
The Iran–Iraq War lasted from September 1980 to August 1988. &quot;The war left the borders unchanged. Three years later, as war with the Western powers loomed, Saddam Hussein recognized Iranian rights over the eastern half of the Shatt al-Arab, a reversion to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; that he had repudiated a decade earlier.&quot; In exchange, Iran gave a promise not to invade Iraq while the latter was busy in Kuwait.

===Kargil War===
The Kargil War was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place in 1999 between 3 May and 26 July of the Kargil district in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LoC). The war started with the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and armed insurgents into positions on the Indian side of the LoC. After two months of fighting, the Indian military regained most of its positions on the Indian side, and the Pakistani forces withdrew to their peacetime positions. The war ended with no territorial changes on either side.

<text>Aliki Stamatina Vougiouklaki (Greek: Αλίκη Σταματίνα Βουγιουκλάκη Greek pronunciation: [aˈlici stamaˈtina vuʝuˈklaci]; 20 July 1934 – 23 July 1996) was a Greek cinema and theater actress, singer and theatrical producer. She is one of the most popular actresses in Greece, and was often referred to as &quot;the National Star of Greece&quot;. Theatrically, she mostly starred in renditions of widely known Broadway musicals as well as multiple Greek tragedy plays. Vougiouklaki died in 1996 at the age of 62, just three months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Aliki Vougiouklaki made her stage debut in a 1953 Athens production of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Malade imaginaire&quot;. Around the same time, she made her movie debut in &quot;The Little Mouse&quot; (1954). She then appeared in over 41 films, one of which, apart from the original Greek, also had a Turkish version but was never officially released in Turkey because of political issues between the two neighboring countries. The majority of her movies met with great success and in 1960 she won the award for Best Actress at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival for her performance in the movie &quot;Madalena&quot;.

==Biography==

Vougiouklaki was born in Marousi to Emmy Koumoundourou and Ioannis Vougiouklakis, who was the provincial governor of Arcadia in the Peloponnese during the war and was executed by the resistance organisation ELAS as a collaborator. She had two brothers, Takis Vougiouklakis (film director) and Antonis (an architect). As a student, she participated in school plays, which eventually led her to an acting career. In 1952, she secretly auditioned for National Theatre of Greece, passed the exams, and started attending classes. She graduated three years later.

==Career==
Her first theatrical role was in &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;, Molière, in 1953, while her first movie, The Little Mouse, was in 1954. She appeared in 42 movies, mostly musicals, television programs, and theatrical productions. She co-starred with Dimitris Papamichail in most of the movies and in a number of theatrical plays.

She received the prize for lead woman&#x27;s role at the inaugural Greek Cinema Festival in Thessaloniki in 1960 for her starring role in Madalena while the movie Ipolochagos Natassa (1970) was the biggest box office success in Greek Cinema.

In 1961 she established her own theatre company and presented successful theatrical plays. In 1962 she was contracted to star in Finos Films&#x27; English language film &quot;Aliki, My love&quot; (also known as &quot;Aliki&quot;). It premiered in London and New York in June 1963, and in Athens in 1964. However, it didn&#x27;t receive the expected success. This failure to make it internationally was the reason she never again attempted an &quot;international movie star&quot; career.

She was popularly known in the press as the National Star of Greece—a term first coined by journalist Eleni Vlahou in 1959. Her last movie was &quot;Nelly, The Spy&quot; (Κατάσκοπος Νέλλη), in 1981. The decline of Greek Cinema prompted her to concentrate on her theatrical career, producing 53 plays. In 1975 she brought to the stage large scale musicals, which changed the usual Greek style of theatrical musical.

In 2008, her son published a biography of Vougiouklaki, &quot;Eho Ena Mistiko&quot; (&quot;I Have A Secret&quot;), the title of a song she sang in &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Cheek&quot;. That same year, a television series based on the book aired on the Alpha TV channel.

==Personal life==
Vougiouklaki married her co-student in National Theater and co-player, Dimitris Papamichail, on 18 January 1965. On 4 June 1969 she gave birth to their son, Yiannis Papamichail. The couple got divorced in 1975 due to &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot;. In 1992, in an interview with Nikos Hadjinikolaou, Vougiouklaki revealed that she secretly married Giorgos Iliadis, a Greek Cypriot businessman, on 25 January 1982 in Athens. They had met in 1976. The couple divorced only a couple of months later, for personal reasons cited by Iliadis, which Vougiouklaki respected.

==Death==
In April 1996, while on tour in Thessaloniki performing the Greek version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; play, Vougiouklaki had severe stomachaches which she believed were caused by the antibiotics she was taking due to a case of bronchitis which had been bothering her. After performing tests at the Express Service, a medical diagnostic centre in Thessaloniki, she was diagnosed with hepatoma, a malignant tumour in her liver. Not having realised the gravity of the situation, she continued performing for another week before the tour was finally cancelled, with her last performance onstage on 28 April.

In Athens, a group of three doctors discovered that the actress had pancreatic cancer. On 7 May she travelled to Munich, where she underwent a series of additional tests. On 10 May Vougiouklaki returned to Greece. On 15 May she traveled to Massachusetts General Hospital in the U.S. in a final effort to be cured. On 19 May she returned permanently to Athens and finally, on 22 May, entered the Athens Medical Centre. On 14 July she fell into hepatic coma and had no communication with those around her. After two months in hospital, she died on 23 July 1996, three days after her 62nd birthday, in Athens Medical Centre. Her funeral was held in Athens Cathedral on 25 July 1996 and she was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens.

==Trivia==

*The film &quot;I Aliki Sto Nautiko&quot; (1961) was filmed aboard the active Greek naval vessel &quot;Aetos&quot; D01, which previously saw action during World War 2 with the United States Navy as USS &quot;Slater&quot; DE-766. &quot;Slater&quot; now operates as a museum ship in Albany, NY.
* &quot;Chtipokardia sto thranio&quot; (1963) was shot simultaneously in Greek and Turkish, with two different crews. Vougiouklaki starred in both versions, with her voice being dubbed in the Turkish version, &quot;Siralardaki heyecanlar&quot;.
* The film, &quot;Ipolochagos Natassa&quot; (1970) sold 751,000 tickets in Athens, which made it the most successful film in Greece, a record held for almost three decades before being broken by Safe Sex.
* She worked with writer Willy Russell when she performed in &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; onstage in 1989.
* Scottish writer Ali Smith used a portrait of Vougiouklaki (from the picture Klotsoskoufi by Dinos Dimopoulos, 1960) in her book &quot;Artful&quot; about four lectures given at Oxford University by the writer.

<text>Machala () is a city in south-west Ecuador. It is the capital of the El Oro Province, and is located near the Gulf of Guayaquil on fertile lowlands. Machala has a population of 288,072 (2022 census); it is the sixth-biggest city in the country, and the second-most important port. It has been referred to as the &quot;Banana Capital of the World&quot;.

==Economy==

Machala is a commercial center for the surrounding agriculture industries. There is a large trade in bananas, coffee and cocoa. The banana industry is especially oriented for exportation, and plays a huge role in the city&#x27;s economy. Bananas are shipped out from nearby Puerto Bolívar mainly to North America. Machala&#x27;s geographical position near Guayaquil also makes it an important transportation center. Many travelers heading south to Peru or north to Guayaquil funnel through the city. It is not known as a tourist destination among Ecuadorians or international tourists, though its proximity to the Pacific Ocean positions it close to beaches. Machala has a growing economy that was marked in 2007 by the inauguration of its first mall, with a movie theater, on the outskirts of the city.

==Orientation==

The center of Machala is dominated by a large Catholic church and a central plaza. The plaza was built in the early 2000s to include a large fountain. There are many hotels situated in the center of the city. Las Brisas, located nearly a mile from the central plaza, is another popular place in Machala; it is a wealthier neighborhood which used to serve as a popular hangout for local teenagers. But the remodeling of La Zona Rosa, as well as the decreased safety of the area, have led to its becoming less popular.

==Education==

Machala has one university, the Universidad Técnica de Machala. There are many private schools in Machala and one public high school – Colegio 9 de Octubre. The city serves as a stopping-off point on the way to nearby Puerto Bolívar and the Jambelí Islands, which can only be reached by ferry.

==Climate==
Machala features a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). Like most of the coastal region of Ecuador, there is a short wet season from January to April due to the retreat of the Humboldt Current. The weather in both wet and dry seasons is very warm to hot and cloudy due to persistent fog from the cold current.

==Transportation==
===Air===

Santa Rosa International Airport serves as the city&#x27;s principal airport. It hosts commercial flights to Quito with the Ecuadorian airline TAME.

<text>James Robert Glass (born 1 August 1973) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He is chiefly remembered for scoring the last-minute goal against Plymouth Argyle which kept Carlisle United in the Football League in 1999, while on loan from Swindon Town. The drama of Glass&#x27;s late goal, which came in one of only three games that he played for Carlisle, has since made it famous in English football at a level beyond its immediate ramifications.

Beyond the Carlisle goal, Glass&#x27;s most notable time with a club was three seasons playing for AFC Bournemouth from 1996 to 1998, his only regular spell at a Football League club; he retired from football in 2001 aged 27.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Glass had a journeyman&#x27;s career in football, playing for many clubs, initially as a reserve keeper for Crystal Palace. He never played a first team game for the Eagles, but was an unused substitute several times, including the 1995 FA Cup semi-final replay against Manchester United, which Palace lost 2–0 at Villa Park. He was transferred to AFC Bournemouth a year later.

The closest he came to a trophy in senior football was reaching the final of the Football League Trophy with Bournemouth in 1998 – Glass scored an own goal in the match, and Bournemouth lost 2–1. It was the last own goal scored at the old Wembley. Glass moved to Swindon Town in the summer of 1998, but after falling out with the manager, Jimmy Quinn, was unable to gain a regular place in the team.

=== Carlisle United ===
He moved to Carlisle United on loan from Swindon late that season (after goalkeeper Tony Caig was sold to Blackpool and Richard Knight&#x27;s loan period had been cut short due to injury). His moment of fame came on 8 May 1999, in the final match of the 1998–99 Third Division season against Plymouth Argyle, which Carlisle needed to win to avoid relegation. With the score 1–1 with only ten seconds remaining, and Carlisle winning a corner, Glass came up from his own penalty area and promptly scored a last minute goal, volleying the ball in after the Plymouth goalkeeper had parried out Scott Dobie&#x27;s goalbound header. Carlisle got the win they needed and Scarborough were relegated to the Football Conference instead after a 1–1 draw with Peterborough United. Scarborough&#x27;s match had already finished before Glass scored, and their fans had already been celebrating on the pitch at the McCain Stadium.

His goal was selected as the 72nd greatest sporting moment ever by the Channel 4 programme &quot;100 Greatest Sporting Moments&quot;. The goal was also ranked 7th in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper&#x27;s list of the 50 most important goals in football history. His goal against Plymouth Argyle was number 15 in the &quot;20 Goals That Shook the World&quot; on ITV4. The Puma boots with which he scored the goal were donated to the National Football Museum in 2014.

=== After Carlisle United ===
Despite his brief fame, this was the last of just three matches Glass played at Carlisle, who were unable to sign him on a permanent basis. Glass spent time at several other clubs, including Oxford United and Brentford, before moving to non-league clubs, and then quitting football altogether. He reportedly scored six goals two weeks running whilst playing Sunday league football in Bournemouth, playing as a striker. He wrote an autobiography, entitled &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot;.

Author Gabriel Kuhn described Glass&#x27;s fame by saying:

== After football ==
Glass retired from professional football at the age of 27, and became an IT salesman. He later became a taxi driver in Dorset, before becoming the managing director of a taxi company. 

In a 2013 BBC interview Glass stated: &quot;It is quite tough because some go on to fame and fortune and some go on to driving a cab and living a normal life like me. It is quite difficult to understand your place in life from being this guy who will never be forgotten to being the guy worrying about your next bill. The goal was an amazing part of my life and is there to be enjoyed, and I will until people get bored of me. Someone on Saturday will be a hero and someone will be a villain. It is an incredible feeling.&quot;

In October 2011, it was announced that Glass joined Poole Town as the new goalkeeping coach, working on a voluntary basis. He also had a job in hospitality at AFC Bournemouth. In 2016, he returned to football as Player Liaison Officer with Premier League club Bournemouth.

On 4 July 2023, Glass was appointed general manager at Wimborne Town. His responsibilities include &quot;managing and developing the club&#x27;s operational programmes, community initiatives and footballing infrastructure&quot;.

<doc id="441995" wikidata="Q860292" url="?curid=441995" title="Earl of Home">
<text>Earl of Home ( ) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1605 for Alexander Home , 6th Lord Home. The Earl of Home holds, among others, the subsidiary titles of Lord Home (created 1473) and Lord Dunglass (1605) in the Peerage of Scotland, and Baron Douglas, of Douglas in the County of Lanark (1875), in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Various Earls of Home have also claimed the title of Lord Hume of Berwick. The Earl is also &quot;Chief of the Name and Arms of Home&quot; and &quot;heir general&quot; to the House of Douglas. The title of Lord Dunglass is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son of the Earl.

The most famous recent holder of the title was the 14th Earl, Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, better known as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. After the unexpected resignation of Harold Macmillan, the 14th Earl was named Prime Minister by the monarch. For the first time in over sixty years, a sitting Prime Minister was a member of the House of Lords rather than of the House of Commons. Because he believed that it was impractical and unconventional to remain a member of the Lords, the Earl disclaimed his peerages on 23 October 1963 under the Peerage Act passed in the same year. He then contested the House of Commons seat of Kinross and Western Perthshire by standing in the 1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election. The seat had been vacated by the death of the previous Member of Parliament, Gilmour Leburn. the titles are held by the 16th Earl, who succeeded in that year.

The family seats are The Hirsel near Coldstream, Berwickshire, and Castlemains near Douglas, South Lanarkshire. Former seats include Douglas Castle (mostly demolished), Dunglass Castle (demolished), Tantallon Castle (ruined) and Bothwell Castle (in the care of the state).

==Origins==
The Earls of Home descend in the male line from Cospatric I (died after 1073), the Anglo-Danish Earl of Northumbria. His descendant William de Home (son of Sir Patrick de Greenlaw, the second son of Cospatric III, Earl of Lothian), adopted the surname following his acquisition of the lands of Home in Berwickshire during the early 13th century, through his marriage to his second cousin Ada (the daughter of Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar). William&#x27;s arms featured the silver lion of Dunbar but with a green field instead of a red field, in reference to his lands of Greenlaw.

<text>Kota Bharu (Kelantanese: &quot;Koto Baghu&quot;), colloquially referred to as KB, is a town in Malaysia that serves as the state capital and royal seat of Kelantan. It is situated in the northeastern part of Peninsular Malaysia and lies near the mouth of the Kelantan River.

The town is home to many religious buildings, various museums, the unique architecture of the old royal palaces (still occupied by the sultan and sultanah and off-limits to visitors but viewable from outside) and former royal buildings (which can be visited). It is served by Keretapi Tanah Melayu&#x27;s East Coast Line at the nearby Wakaf Bharu Terminal Station, in the town of Wakaf Bharu across the Kelantan River and Sultan Ismail Petra Airport, located in Pengkalan Chepa.

== Etymology ==
Kota Bharu means &quot;new city&quot; or &quot;new castle/fort&quot; in Malay. Occasionally, the name of the city is written as Kota Baharu. 

==History==
Kota Bharu was founded during the late 19th century. Before the establishment, Kota Bharu was home to Kelantan&#x27;s Royal Palace, then established by Sultan Muhammad II of Kelantan in 1844 as Kelantan&#x27;s state capital who wanted the new state capital built in his honour. Prior to this, Kota Bharu was known as Kuala Kelantan. Before Kota Bharu assumed the role, the Kelantanese capital was divided into two which were Kota Kubang Labu and Kota Pengkalan Datu. During the 19th century, Kelantan was a prosperous and populous state with a population of around 30,000 to 50,000 people including a thousand Chinese. Production from within the state include gold, tin ore, black pepper, areca nut, rice, rattan, bamboo, agarwood and songket. Kota Bharu acts as entrepot for goods due to its strategic location beside the Kelantan River.

During World War II, Pantai Sabak, about from Kota Bharu, was the initial landing point of the Japanese invasion forces on 8 December 1941, beginning the Battle of Kota Bharu, the first battle of the Malayan campaign. Japanese forces captured the city and would go on to successfully engage the British in jungle warfare and ultimately capture Singapore.

Kota Bharu was declared as the &quot;Cultural City&quot; on 25 July 1991 by the late Sultan Ismail Petra on the basis of two important aspects – the history of Kota Bharu and the uniqueness of its local arts and cultures. Kota Bharu was rebranded as the &quot;Islamic City&quot; () by the Kelantan State Government on 1 October 2005 through its &quot;Developing With Islam&quot; () policy.

==Government==
Kota Bharu Municipal Council, officially known as the Islamic City of Kota Bharu Municipal Council (, Jawi: مجليس ڤربندرن كوتا بهارو بندراي اسلام) and formerly known as the Kota Bharu Town Council () from 1936 until 1971 and the Kota Bharu Town Board () from 1971 until 1978, is the local authority of Kota Bharu.

==Kota Bharu as an Islamic City==
Kota Bharu was declared an Islamic city on Saturday, 1 October 2005 at 10pm by the Sultan of Kelantan, DYMM Sultan Ismail Petra ibni al-Marhum Sultan Yahya Petra at the Sultan Mohammed IV Stadium. The inauguration was accompanied by a fireworks display as an inauguration gimmick and performances of poetry, dikir barat, nasyid and singing by special guests, namely Mawi, M. Nasir, Halim Yazid, Kumpulan Rabbani and Akhil Hayy. The inauguration was also witnessed by thousands of attendees who had to watch on screens installed in several places around Kota Bharu.

After the inauguration, the Kota Bharu Municipal Council (MPKB) was renamed the Islamic City of Kota Bharu Municipal Council (MPKB-BRI).

However, this declaration did not mean that the city of Kota Bharu had received the status of a city like others, but simply called Kota Bharu a city with Islamic characteristics.

==Demographics==
The vast majority of Kota Bharu&#x27;s population is ethnically Kelantanese Malay. The language spoken in Kota Bharu is Kelantan Malay dialect. There is also a fairly large Chinese population.

===Religion===
Kota Bharu town&#x27;s population is 93% Muslim, with the remainder consisting of Buddhists, Hindus and Christians. The predominantly urban local Chinese community mainly practices Buddhism.

==Culture==

The Kelantanese culture is highly distinctive as compared to other states of Malaysia but also with some influences from Thailand due to its geographical proximity.

===Food===
Nasi berlauk, nasi dagang, nasi lemak and nasi kerabu are popular elements of the local cuisine. Sweet cakes, or kuih, are also popular amongst the Kelantanese. Other popular foods include nasi tumpang, etok, akok, lompat tikam &amp; netbak.

== Climate ==
Kota Bharu features a tropical monsoon climate bordering on a tropical rainforest climate. Kota Bharu does not have a true dry season although the city experiences noticeably heavier rainfall from August through January. Also, Kota Bharu experiences slightly cooler temperatures between December and February than during the rest of the year. The city sees on average about of precipitation annually.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===
Grab Car services, available for 24 hours a day, are provided in Kota Bharu since April 2017.

Kota Bharu is serviced by Sultan Ismail Petra Airport, the busiest airport in east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (IATA: KBR).

The closest railway station is the Wakaf Bharu station on the other side of the river, 6 km from the city centre.

The under construction MRL East Coast Rail Link will have a station at Kota Bahru. The Kota Bharu station will be located near Kampung Tunjong.

Kota Bahru is served by local bus services, and intercity bus services. There are two bus terminals in the city, and buses connect to bigger towns and border towns such as Sungai Kolok and Gua Musang. 
===Roadways===
Highway 8 is the main highway leading Kota Bharu to the federal capital Kuala Lumpur. Highway 3 connects Kota Bharu to Pasir Mas and the Thailand border in the west, or Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan or even Johor Bahru due south. Connection to Penang is possible via highway 4. The Lebuhraya Rakyat, or People&#x27;s Expressway, is a planned expressway that is to connect Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai in southern Kelantan. The project has been integrated into the Central Spine Road project (assigned as highway 34), scheduled to be complete by 2020.

==Tourism==

=== Beaches ===
Strong surf threatens all major beaches in the vicinity of Kota Bharu with substantial erosion. The community has been implementing wave breakers by piling up massive amounts of boulders in an effort to protect the coastline. Regular beach activity has become impossible as visitors frequent beaches further south. In terms of tourism, the most famous beach in Kota Bharu is Pantai Cahaya Bulan.

=== Wreck diving ===
Diving in Kota Bharu is a relatively new activity. At present, only one dive shop operates in the area. Trips out to the wreck of the &quot;IJN Awazisan Maru&quot; (known locally as the &quot;Japanese Invasion Wreck&quot;) are among the sites offered. This Japanese transport ship was the first vessel to sink in the Pacific War. The wreck is a 30-minute boat journey from a jetty which is 10 minutes outside of Kota Bharu.

<doc id="442011" wikidata="Q1869904" url="?curid=442011" title="Lord of Parliament">
<text>A Lord of Parliament () was the holder of the lowest form of peerage, entitled as of right to take part in sessions of the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland. Since that Union in 1707, it has been the lowest rank of the Peerage of Scotland, ranking below a viscount. A Lord of Parliament is said to hold a &quot;Lordship of Parliament&quot;.

==Details==

The peerage of Scotland differs from those of England and Ireland in that its lowest rank is not that of baron. In Scotland, &quot;baron&quot; is a rank within the Baronage of Scotland, considered a minor lord who is not a peer, approximately equivalent to a baron in some continental countries. The Scottish equivalent to the English or Irish baron is a Lord of Parliament.

Barons in Scotland were historically feudal barons until 2004, when a change in Scottish law abolished the feudal system This reform &quot;expressly preserves the dignity of baron... and any other dignity or office, whether or not of feudal origin,&quot; converting feudal titles into non-territorial dignities—personal titles no longer attached to the land, including the quality, precedence, and heraldic rights pertaining.

=== Lords of Parliament ===
A male holder of such a lordship is designated a &quot;Lord of Parliament,&quot; while there is no similar designation for female holders. Lords of Parliament are referred to as &quot;Lord X&quot;, while female holders of Lordships of Parliament are known as &quot;Lady X&quot;. The wife of a Lord of Parliament is also &quot;Lady X&quot;. Children of Lords of Parliament and female holders of Lordships of Parliament are styled &quot;The Honourable [Forename] [Surname]&quot;, except that the heir apparent to the peerage is styled &quot;The Master of [peerage title]&quot;. Where succession by women is allowed, an heiress presumptive may be styled &quot;The Mistress of [peerage title]&quot;. After the death of father and/or mother, the child may continue to use the style &quot;the Honourable&quot;.

The creation of Lordships of Parliament ceased when Scotland and England were combined into a single Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, when their parliaments were merged.

From 1707 to 1963, the Scottish peers were represented in the House of Lords by Scottish representative peers, but from 1963 to 1999 they were all entitled to sit there. However, the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the right of hereditary peers, including Lords of Parliament, to sit in the House of Lords, except that a number of hereditary peers do still sit, following election by hereditary peers. In 1999, two Lords of Parliament were so elected: Lord Reay and the Lady Saltoun. Following the death of Lord Reay on 10 May 2013, only Lady Saltoun remained in Parliament. Lady Saltoun resigned from the House of Lords in December 2014.

Lords of Parliament have no provision to be specially represented in the contemporary Scottish Parliament, but the Scotland Act 1998 allows peers (whether of the United Kingdom, Great Britain, England, Scotland, or Ireland) to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament.

==Other uses==

The term Lord/Lady of Parliament may also be used to refer to any member of the House of Lords. A prominent official example is in a Standing Order of the House of Lords: &quot;Bishops to whom a writ of summons have been issued are not Peers but are Lords of Parliament.&quot;

<text>Francisco Álvarez–Cascos Fernández (born 1 October 1947) is a Spanish politician. He was Secretary-General of the ruling Partido Popular from 1989 to 1999 and the President of the Principality of Asturias from 2011 to 2012.

Álvarez-Cascos studied civil engineering, and after working in an architect office and then for an architects association for a few years, he soon became a professional politician. In 1976 he joined Reforma Democrática, which later merged into Alianza Popular, both right-wing parties. He was the spokesman for the Gijón Council between 1979 and 1986, a county councilor and a member of the regional Pre-Autonomous Body.

In 1982, after Alianza Popular merged into the center-right People&#x27;s Party, he was elected senator for Asturias, a position which he combined with that of spokesman for the People&#x27;s Party Parliamentary Group in the General Junta of the Principate of Asturias (Asturias&#x27; regional legislature) from 1983 onwards. In 1986 he was elected deputy for Asturias and was re-elected in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 2000.

At the 9th National Congress of the People&#x27;s Party, he was elected Secretary-General. He was confirmed three times in this office at the national congresses of the PP which took place in Seville (1990) and Madrid (1993 and 1996).

Álvarez-Cascos was First Vice President of the Government and Minister of the Presidency for the 1996-2000 term, and Minister for Development for the 2000-2004 term.

In 2004, he resigned from Congress and left politics for a few years.

== President of Asturias ==
In 2009, a sector of the party began to ask him to become PP&#x27;s candidate for President of Asturias, organizing meetings and a campaign for his nomination. The regional party leadership led by Gabino de Lorenzo rejected him as a candidate and insulted him since he wanted to fire many of the people in charge in the party for decades losing election after election. The national leader Mariano Rajoy declined to support him against the attacks within his party, so he resigned from the party. In May 2011 he managed in just five months to create a new party Asturian Forum, which obtained a plurality of 16 out of the 45 seats in the Asturian autonomous parliament. He was inaugurated as President of Asturias.

After six months of minority government and the PP and PSOE (which together had an absolute majority of seats) declining every bill, his regional budget for 2012 was rejected. This blocked situation forced him to resign on 30 January 2012 and call for new elections to be held on 25 March. Asturian Forum lost 4 seats, ending up second behind the Socialist Party.

==Bárcenas affair==
As part of the Bárcenas affair, it was revealed that Francisco Álvarez Cascos received 421,693 euros of cash from the Popular Party between 1990 and 2004.

<doc id="442023" wikidata="Q6942217" url="?curid=442023" title="Music of Nicaragua">
<text>The Music of [[Nicaragua]] contains a mixture of European, Indigenous, and African influences. Occasionally, it also rarely features Asian and Arab musical influences as well as from other countries of Hispanic and Latino origin. Musical instruments include the marimba and others that are common across Central America. Pop music includes performers from all around the world including Nicaraguans, Cubans, Brazilians, Mexicans, Panamanians, as well as those from Europe and the United States.

Nicaraguans enjoy their local artist&#x27;s music but also enjoy music from around the world. They enjoy the Dominican Republic&#x27;s bachata and merengue, Jamaica&#x27;s reggae, Puerto Rico&#x27;s salsa and reggaeton and Colombia&#x27;s Cumbia among other genres including pop. Among the younger crowds, heavy metal and rock have become very popular.

==Styles of music==

Nicaraguan music is a mixture of different cultures from indigenous tribes, European conquerors, and slaves. Styles of music vary throughout the different regions in the country. In the Caribbean coast music with African and indigenous influence are heard, in the Pacific coast the music is considered to be a mixture of the indigenous and Spanish culture and in the North/Central region of Nicaragua the music has more of a European flavor, this is because of the significant wave of Europeans, mostly Germans, that live in the region. European influenced dances like the polka and Mazurka are also danced in this region.
Another popular musical genre in Nicaragua is the Chicheros, often consisting of a trumpet and trombone or other brass instruments, with additional musicians playing various percussion. This is often to be heard in private parties around the country.

==Instruments==
The marimba of Nicaragua distinguishes itself from the other forms of marimba in Central America by the way it is played. Nicaragua&#x27;s marimba is played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. They are usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar similar to a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers.

==Theater==

Indigenous theater groups performed with music and dance. Theatrical manifestations include the Elegant Knights of Huaco Bull and the UNESCO proclaimed masterpiece, &quot;El Güegüense&quot;, among many others.

==Nicaraguans in Music==
One of the most prominent composers from Nicaragua is the leonés musician José de la Cruz Mena (1874-1907). He wrote a variety of romantic waltzes that display sounds inspired by common and daily experiences, or natural scenarios. Among those compositions, we found titles such as &quot;El Nacatamal,&quot; &quot;Los Turcos,&quot; and &quot;Ruinas.&quot; Besides, Mena&#x27;s pieces are evocative of biblical characters and love relationship; titles like &quot;Amores de Abraham,&quot; &quot;Bonita Margarita,&quot; &quot;Rosalía&quot; are part of the most representative ones. By the time, Mena gathered popularity and influenced composers from different countries of the Americas; additionally, in the late 1800s, his name reached Asia and Europe particularly Germany and Italy inspiring Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Boheme&quot;.

Another relevant composer is Luis Abraham Delgadillo, with several symphonies, stage works, orchestral pieces, chamber music, songs, and piano music to his credit, and Camilo Zapata, creator of the &quot;Nicaraguan Sound&quot;. Erwin Krüger, creator of &quot;Barrio de Pescadores&quot; (Fisherman&#x27;s District). Justo Santos creator of &quot;La Mora Limpia&quot; (A Clean Coffee Bean), considered Nicaragua&#x27;s popular anthem.

Other prominent national musicians, groups, and songwriters include Lía Barrios, Marcio Brenes Mejía from Somoto, Nicaragua, Katia Cardenal, Salvador Cardenal, Marina Cárdenas, Dimension Costeña, Norma Helena Gadea, Macolla, Carlos Mejía Godoy, Luis Enrique Mejía Godoy, Luis Enrique Mejía López (known as Luis Enrique), Los Mokuanes, Sergio Tapia, and Hernaldo Zúñiga.

Of the younger generation of Nicaraguan singer-songwriters there are a few notable such as Latin Grammy Nominee Ramón Armando Mejía (Perrozompopo), Arturo Vaughan, Moisés Gadea, Juan Montenegro, Junior Escobar, Elsa Basil, Cecilia Ferrer, Alejandro Carlos Mejía, Clara Grun, Noel Portocarrero, Duo Guardabarranco, Juan Solorzano, and Marcio Brenes JR. Also, rock bands such as Necrosis, Grupo Armado, Crisis, Monroy y Surmenage, Mano de Vidrio, Contrapeso, Q69K, Kerfodermo, Resistencia, Carga Cerrada and Cecilia &amp; The Argonauts.

Hip Hop and Reggaeton artist include Torombolo, J Smooth, Mr. Meli, Nello Style, Mayki Graff, Nica and Lingo Nicoya.

Nicaragua&#x27;s Caribbean coast is home to prominent reggae singers and groups such as Philip Montalban, Carlos de Nicaragua, Kali Boom, Warrior Street, Sabu, Sabu Sr. and Osberto Jerez y los Gregory&#x27;s.

Also notable instrumentalists such as guitarists Tony Melendez, Arturo Vaughan, Roberto Vaughan, Eduardo Araica, Omar Suazo, Arnulfo Oviedo, Saulo Pérez, and Andrés Sánchez, marimba player Carlos Luis Mejia, drummers Jorge Lanzas, Bikentios Chávez, Matute, Johnny Metralla, Henry Palacios, and percussionist José Areas who was inducted in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame with the band Santana.

<doc id="442024" wikidata="Q240559" url="?curid=442024" title="Harmonograph">
<text>A harmonograph is a mechanical apparatus that employs pendulums to create a geometric image. The drawings created typically are Lissajous curves or related drawings of greater complexity. The devices, which began to appear in the mid-19th century and peaked in popularity in the 1890s, cannot be conclusively attributed to a single person, although Hugh Blackburn, a professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow, is commonly believed to be the official inventor.

A simple, so-called &quot;lateral&quot; harmonograph uses two pendulums to control the movement of a pen relative to a drawing surface. One pendulum moves the pen back and forth along one axis, and the other pendulum moves the drawing surface back and forth along a perpendicular axis. By varying the frequency and phase of the pendulums relative to one another, different patterns are created. Even a simple harmonograph as described can create ellipses, spirals, and other Lissajous figures.

More complex harmonographs incorporate three or more pendulums or linked pendulums together (for example, hanging one pendulum off another), or involve rotary motion, in which one or more pendulums is mounted on gimbals to allow movement in any direction.

A particular type of harmonograph, a pintograph, is based on the relative motion of two rotating disks, as illustrated in the links below. (A pintograph is not to be confused with a pantograph, which is a mechanical device used to enlarge figures.)

==History==

In the 1870s, the term &quot;harmonograph&quot; is attested in connection with A. E. Donkin and devices built by Samuel Charles Tisley.

==Blackburn pendulum==

A Blackburn pendulum is a device for illustrating simple harmonic motion, it was named after Hugh Blackburn, who described it in 1844. This was first discussed by James Dean in 1815 and analyzed mathematically by Nathaniel Bowditch in the same year. A bob is suspended from a string that in turn hangs from a V-shaped pair of strings, so that the pendulum oscillates simultaneously in two perpendicular directions with different periods. The bob consequently follows a path resembling a Lissajous curve; it belongs to the family of mechanical devices known as harmonographs.

Mid-20th century physics textbooks sometimes refer to this type of pendulum as a double pendulum.

==Computer-generated harmonograph figure==
A harmonograph creates its figures using the movements of damped pendulums. The movement of a damped pendulum is described by the equation

: formula_1

in which formula_2 represents frequency, formula_3 represents phase, formula_4 represents amplitude, formula_5 represents damping and formula_6 represents time. If that pendulum can move about two axes (in a circular or elliptical shape), due to the principle of superposition, the motion of a rod connected to the bottom of the pendulum along one axes will be described by the equation

: formula_7

A typical harmonograph has two pendulums that move in such a fashion, and a pen that is moved by two perpendicular rods connected to these pendulums. Therefore, the path of the harmonograph figure is described by the parametric equations

: formula_8

An appropriate computer program can translate these equations into a graph that emulates a harmonograph. Applying the first equation a second time to each equation can emulate a moving piece of paper (see the figure below).

<doc id="442030" wikidata="Q4355293" url="?curid=442030" title="HMS Aeneas (P427)">
<text>HMS &quot;Aeneas&quot; (P427) was a British of the Royal Navy, built by Cammell Laird and launched on 9 October 1945. It was named after the hero Aeneas from Greek mythology.

== Service history ==
&quot;Aeneas&quot; took part in the Coronation Review of the Fleet to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

&quot;Aeneas&quot; played the part of the M1 submarine in the 1967 James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.

In 1972 &quot;Aeneas&quot; was hired by Vickers for use in what proved to be successful trials of the Submarine-Launched Airflight Missile (SLAM) system, an anti-aircraft system using a cluster of four Shorts Blowpipe missiles on an extendable mast, allowing attacks against low flying aircraft while the submarine was at periscope depth.

&quot;Aeneas&quot; was broken up in 1974.

On 26 September 2012, at the company&#x27;s Le Mourillon plant, DNCS announced plans to design and build a submarine canister-based air defence weapon based on MBDA&#x27;s Mistral. The concept is based on the British SLAM, Submarine Launched Airflight Missile which was based on the Blowpipe developed by Vickers in the 1970s, and used on HMS &quot;Aeneas&quot;.

<doc id="442031" wikidata="Q840688" url="?curid=442031" title="Plasticine">
<text>Plasticine is a putty-like modelling material made from calcium salts, petroleum jelly and aliphatic acids. Though originally a brand name for the British version of the product, it is now applied generically in English as a product category to other formulations. 

Plasticine is used for children&#x27;s play and as a modelling medium for more formal or permanent structures. Because of its non-drying property, it is a material commonly chosen for stop motion animation, including several Academy Award-winning films by Nick Park.

== History ==
Franz Kolb, owner of a pharmacy in Munich, Germany, invented an oil-based modelling clay in 1880. At the time, the city was a centre for the arts, and among Kolb&#x27;s circle of friends were sculptors. They complained about how with the clay they were using for modelling, their sculptures would dry too fast and that, particularly in winter, it was too difficult to work with. In order to commercialize his invention, he presented it to the Faber-Castell company in 1887, which had back then the name &quot;&quot;Kunst-Modellierthon&quot; (known as Plastilin), where it is still sold nowadays under the name &quot;Münchner Künstler Plastilin&quot; (Munich artists&#x27; Plastilin). In Italy, the product &quot;Pongo&quot; is also marketed as &quot;plastilina&quot;&quot; and shares the main attributes of Plasticine.

Plasticine is approximately 65% bulking agent (principally gypsum), 10% petroleum jelly, 5% lime, 10% lanolin and 10% stearic acid. It cannot be hardened by firing, it melts when exposed to heat, and is flammable at higher temperatures. In France, it is made by Herbin, and marketed as Plastiline. In Spain, toy manufacturer Jovi markets a product also branded &quot;Plastilina&quot;, made from vegetable matter which makes it lighter. Play-Doh, which is based on flour, salt and water, dries on exposure to air.

===Harbutt===
William Harbutt, an art teacher in Bath, England, formulated Plasticine in 1897. Harbutt wanted a non-drying clay for his sculpture students. He created a non-toxic, sterile, soft and malleable clay that did not dry when exposed to air.

Harbutt received a patent in 1899 and commercial production started at a factory in Bathampton in 1900. The original Plasticine was grey, but four colours were produced for initial sales to the public. Plasticine was used by children and was often bought by schools for teaching art. It has found a wide variety of other uses (for example moulding casts for plaster, and plastics).

Harbutt patented a different formulation in 1915, which added wool fibres to give plasticine a stronger composition intended for ear plugs, and as a sterile dressing for wounds and burns. The Harbutt company marketed Plasticine as a children&#x27;s toy by producing modelling kits based on characters from children&#x27;s stories, such as Noddy, the Mr. Men and Paddington Bear.

The original Plasticine factory was destroyed by fire in 1963 and replaced by a modern building. The Harbutt company produced Plasticine in Bathampton until 1983, when production was moved to Thailand.

The Colorforms company was the major American licensee of Plasticine from 1979 until at least 1984. The use of a different chalk compound caused a product inconsistency, and the US version was considered inferior to the original mix.

Bluebird Toys plc acquired Plasticine through its purchase of Peter Pan Playthings Ltd, Harbutt&#x27;s parent company. In 1998, Mattel bought Bluebird and the brand was sold to Humbrol Ltd, known for its model paints and owner of the Airfix model kit brand. Flair Leisure licensed the brand from Humbrol in 2005 and relaunched Plasticine. It acquired the brand outright, when Humbrol entered administration a year later.

== Uses ==
===Current===
Plasticine is one type of clay used in claymation. One of its main proponents is Aardman Animations&#x27; Nick Park, who used characters modelled in Plasticine in his four Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit short films &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; (1989), &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993), &quot;A Close Shave&quot; (1995) and &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot; (2008), as well as the feature films &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; (2005) and &quot;Vengeance Most Fowl&quot; (2024). Plasticine-like materials are appealing to animators because the material can be used with ease: it is mouldable enough to create a character, flexible enough to allow that character to move in many ways, and dense enough to retain its shape easily when combined with a wire armature, and does not melt under hot studio lighting.

Plasticine is used in long jump and triple jump competitions to help officials determine if the competitors are making legal jumps. A &#x27;indicator board&#x27; is placed beyond and slightly above the take-off line. The edges of this are chamfered and edged with plasticine. If an athlete leaves a mark in the plasticine, it is considered proof that the jump was a foul, and the attempt is not measured. Plasticine is used rather than sand, so that several boards may be prepared in advance: if a board is marked it may be replaced by a smoothed board immediately to avoid delaying the competition, but keeping the marked board available in case of challenges. An indicator board is used, rather than a wide strip of plasticine, as this provides a firm footing should the athlete step on it.

Plasticine-like clays are also used in commercial party games such as Barbarossa.
Television presenter James May, together with Chris Collins, Jane McAdam Freud, Julian Fullalove and around 2,000 members of the public, created a show garden made entirely of Plasticine for the 2009 Chelsea Flower Show. Called &quot;Paradise in Plasticine&quot;, it took 6 weeks and 2.6 tons of Plasticine in 24 colours to complete. May said, &quot;This is, to our knowledge, the largest and most complex model of this type ever created.&quot; It couldn&#x27;t be considered as part of the standard judging criteria as it contained no real plants, but was awarded an honorary gold award made from Plasticine. The garden won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s &#x27;peoples choice&#x27; for best small garden.

Plasticine is used by geologists studying rock deformation. One study compared the performance of four German products: Beck&#x27;s green and Beck&#x27;s orange made by Beck&#x27;s Plastilin, Gomaringen; Kolb brown made by Kolb, Hengersberg; and Weible special soft made by Weible KG, Schorndorf.

===Historic===

During World War II, Plasticine was used by bomb disposal officer Major John P. Hudson R.E. as part of the defuzing process for the new German &quot;Type Y&quot; battery-powered bomb fuze. The &quot;Type Y&quot; fuze has an anti-disturbance device that had to be disabled before the fuze could be removed. Plasticine was used to build a dam around the head of the fuze to hold some liquid oxygen. The liquid oxygen cooled the battery down to a temperature at which it would no longer function; with the battery out of commission, the fuze could be removed safely.

<text>HMS &quot;Black Swan&quot;, was the name ship of the sloops of the Royal Navy. This class was admired for its sea-going qualities.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Black Swan&quot;, named after the black swan, was laid down by Yarrow Shipbuilders on 20 June 1938, launched on 7 July 1939, and commissioned on 27 January 1940.

The &quot;Black Swan&quot; class was a lengthened version of the earlier s. The main gun armament consisted of six QF 4 inch Mk XVI anti-aircraft guns in three twin turrets, with the fourth 4 inch turret of the Egret class removed to allow addition of a quadruple barrel 2-pounder pom-pom short-range anti-aircraft gun. Anti submarine armament consisted of depth charge throwers with 40 depth charges carried.

When completed, &quot;Black Swan&quot; was not fitted with the planned quadruple pom-pom, but with two quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mounts fitted instead. The pom-pom was installed in May 1941, and the ineffective machine guns replaced by a single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon in September that year. The Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon and two more 20 mm cannon were fitted in June 1942, and a further three cannon were fitted in 1943. The ship&#x27;s depth charge complement was increased to 110 during the war.

After a successful &#x27;Warship Week&#x27; National Savings campaign in March 1942 the ship was adopted by the civil community of Widnes, Lancashire

==Operational history==
&quot;Black Swan&quot; was initially deployed on convoy escort missions along the British east coast, before the Norwegian Campaign caused &quot;Black Swan&quot; to be attached to the Home Fleet, where it was used to provide anti-aircraft cover to the Allied landings at Åndalsnes. &quot;Black Swan&quot; was heavily engaged by German bombers before being hit by a bomb which passed through the ship before exploding, on 27 April 1940.

After repair, in June &quot;Black Swan&quot; returned to escort duty in the North Sea, before being damaged by a mine on 1 November 1940. This time, the ship was under repair until May 1941, when it was transferred to Western Approaches Command, escorting convoys in the Irish Sea. &quot;Black Swan&quot; was again slightly damaged by bombing in August that year and was transferred to Londonderry as part of the 37th Escort Group, escorting convoys to and from Gibraltar.
On 25 October &quot;Black Swan&quot; rescued 34 survivors in a lifeboat from the cargo ship , which had been sunk two days earlier. After a search the sloop rescued another 27 survivors in a second lifeboat from the same ship. The next month &quot;Black Swan&quot; escorted convoys in support of Operation Torch.

On 2 April 1943, when escorting Convoy OS 45, from Liverpool to Freetown, &quot;Black Swan&quot; and the sank the top-scoring U-boat with all hands off the coast of Portugal.

In 1943 &quot;Black Swan&quot; for a short time saw action near Iceland to provide escort against the U-boat threat, after which she served in the Mediterranean, on Malta and Adriatic convoy protection duties. From there, &quot;Black Swan&quot; passed through the Suez Canal en route to the Asia, Far East and Pacific theatres against the Japanese forces. The ship was on active duties as far as Australia and the Philippine Islands.

At the end of hostilities in 1945 &quot;Black Swan&quot; followed the cruiser into Shanghai and were the first Royal Navy warships to liberate Japanese concentration camps containing British and Empire prisoners.

In 1949 she took part in the Yangtze Incident when she, with others, went to aid of . &quot;Black Swan&quot; suffered 12 men wounded and severe damage to her superstructure in a fierce engagement with Chinese batteries and fell back. The failed relief effort cost 46 killed and 64 injured. &quot;Black Swan&quot; also served in the Korean War and was involved in the Battle of Chumonchin Chan. &quot;Black Swan&quot; was scrapped in 1956 at Troon in Scotland. She was affiliated with TS &quot;Black Swan&quot; – a Sea Cadet Corps unit in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

<text>HMS &quot;Caesar&quot; (at the time written &quot;Cæsar&quot;) was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy, named after the Roman military and political leader Julius Caesar. The ship was built at the Portsmouth Dockyard, starting with her keel laying in March 1895. She was launched in September 1896 and was commissioned into the fleet in January 1898. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and a secondary battery of twelve guns. The ship had a top speed of .

&quot;Caesar&quot; served with the Mediterranean Fleet after a brief stint in the Channel Fleet. In 1905, she resumed service with a now re-organised Channel Fleet and was also part of the Atlantic Fleet for a time. In the service of the Home Fleet from 1907, she was placed in reserve in 1912. Following the outbreak of the First World War, &quot;Caesar&quot; returned to the Channel Fleet before being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in 1915 after a brief spell as a guard ship at Gibraltar. From 1918 to 1919 she served as a depot ship, firstly in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and then the Black Sea, in support of naval operations against the Bolsheviks. In this latter role, she was the last of the pre-dreadnought battleships to see service outside the United Kingdom. Returning to England in 1920, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1921.

== Design ==

&quot;Caesar&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube Scotch marine boilers. By 1907–1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were considered to have handled well, with an easy roll, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on circular barbettes, unlike six of her sisters, which retained earlier pear-shaped barbettes. &quot;Caesar&quot; also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull on the broadside, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher on the stern.

&quot;Caesar&quot; and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey steel in their belt armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed &quot;Caesar&quot; and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armour, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship&#x27;s armoured deck was thick.

== Service history ==

HMS &quot;Caesar&quot; was built at the Portsmouth Dockyard, with her keel laying taking place on 25 March 1895. She was launched on 2 September 1896, and completed in January 1898. The ship was commissioned at Portsmouth on 13 January to serve in the Mediterranean Fleet. Before leaving for the Mediterranean, she was attached temporarily to the Channel Fleet to serve in home waters. In May 1898, &quot;Caesar&quot; departed the United Kingdom for her Mediterranean service under the command of Captain Edward Harpur Gamble. She visited Taormina on the island of Sicily in February 1900, and underwent a refit at Malta in 1900–1901. Captain George Callaghan was appointed to command her on 21 December 1901, succeeding Captain John Ferris. She ended her Mediterranean service in October 1903, paying off at Portsmouth on 6 October 1903 to begin a refit.

Her refit completed, &quot;Caesar&quot; was commissioned at Portsmouth on 2 February 1904 to relieve her sister ship as flagship of the Channel Fleet. When the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet as a result of a reorganisation on 1 January 1905, &quot;Caesar&quot; became flagship of the Atlantic Fleet. She was relieved of this duty in March 1905, becoming 2nd Flagship of the new Channel Fleet (which had been the Home Fleet prior to the reorganisation). On 3 June 1905, &quot;Caesar&quot; collided with and sank the barque &quot;Afghanistan&quot; off Dungeness, suffering significant damage; her bridge wings were carried away and the boats, davits, and net booms on her port side were badly damaged. &quot;Caesar&quot; was refitted at Devonport to repair the damage.

&quot;Caesar&quot; became Flagship, Rear Admiral, Home Fleet, in December 1905. She was relieved of this duty in February 1907 and transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet to become its temporary flagship. She served in this role until May 1907. On 27 May 1907, &quot;Caesar&quot; was recommissioned for service in the Devonport Division of the new Home Fleet, which had been formed in January 1907. During this service she underwent a refit at Devonport in 1907–1908. In May 1909, &quot;Caesar&quot; transferred to the Nore, temporarily serving as the flagship of Vice Admiral, 3rd and 4th Divisions, Home Fleet. In April 1911 she transferred to Devonport to serve in the 3rd Division, Home Fleet. On 16 January 1911, &quot;Caesar&quot; was rammed by the barque &quot;Excelsior&quot; in fog at Sheerness, suffering no serious damage. In March 1912, &quot;Caesar&quot; was placed in commissioned reserve with a nucleus crew as part of the 4th Division, Home Fleet.

===First World War===

At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, &quot;Caesar&quot; was brought back into full commission and transferred to the 7th Battle Squadron of the Channel Fleet; the squadron was charged with the defence of the English Channel. During this service she helped in transporting the Plymouth Marine Division from Plymouth to Ostend, Belgium, and covered the passage of the British Expeditionary Force from England to France in September 1914. In December 1914, &quot;Caesar&quot; was detached from the 7th Battle Squadron and transferred to Gibraltar to serve as guard ship and gunnery training ship there. In July 1915, she transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, serving as guard ship and gunnery training ship at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda and patrolling the Atlantic. In 1918 she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Morgan Singer, second-in-command, North America and West Indies Station (to Vice-Admiral Sir William Lowther Grant, the Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station), and Admiral Superintendent, Bermuda.

Her North America and West Indies Station service ended in September 1918, when &quot;Caesar&quot; was transferred to relieve HMS &quot;Andromache&quot; (the old second-class cruiser and former minelayer ) as flagship of the Senior Naval Officer, British Adriatic Squadron, at Corfu, the last British pre-dreadnought to serve as a flagship. In September 1918, &quot;Caesar&quot; went to Malta for refit as a depot ship, during which she was equipped with repair shops and with leisure facilities such as recreation rooms and reading rooms. This conversion completed, she took up duties in October 1918 at Mudros as depot ship for the British Aegean Squadron. In January 1919 she was transferred to Port Said, Egypt, for service as a depot ship there. In June 1919, &quot;Caesar&quot; transited the Dardanelles and transferred to the Black Sea, where she served as a depot ship for British naval forces operating against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. In this service she became the last British pre-dreadnought to serve operationally overseas. &quot;Caesar&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in March 1920, paid off at Devonport on 23 April 1920, and was placed on the disposal list. She was sold to a British firm for scrapping on 8 November 1921, then resold to a German firm in July 1922 and towed from Devonport to Germany to be scrapped.

<text>HMT &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot; (FY142) was a British Second World War anti-submarine trawler of the British Royal Navy, named after Cambridgeshire, an English county.

The 443 ton trawler was laid down on 2 July 1935 at Smiths Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees and completed by the end of the year. The Royal Navy requisitioned her in August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the war and converted her to an anti-submarine vessel, armed with a single 4 inch gun, machine guns, and depth charges.

On 17 June 1940, &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot; took part in the rescue of passengers and crew from the bombing of RMS &quot;Lancastria&quot; in the estuary of the River Loire during Operation Aerial. The ship&#x27;s boat picked up many survivors from the water while German aircraft bombed and machine gunned them. &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot;″s Lewis gunners claimed to have shot down one of the attacking planes. &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot; rescued an estimated 800 people; one of them was Lord Inverclyde. Three members of &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot;″s crew received decorations for their conduct.

Later that night, &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot; received orders to evacuate the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke, and his staff to England because the destroyer allocated was no longer available. There were no rafts or life jackets onboard following the rescue work and the decks were covered in bunker oil and discarded clothing. General Brooke had to clean the oil from his cabin. She left St Nazaire at 3am on 18 June and arrived in Plymouth late in the afternoon of the following day, having acted as an escort to a convoy of evacuation ships en route.

In June 1944, &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot; took part in Operation Neptune, the naval element of the Normandy Landings. The Navy sold her in 1945. She returned to commercial fishing, and was renamed &quot;Kingston Sapphire&quot; in 1947. The trawler was scrapped at Bruges, Belgium in October 1954.

The British recaptured her in 1782 and renamed her &quot;Raven&quot;, only to have the French recapture her again early in 1783.

<doc id="442044" wikidata="Q82870" url="?curid=442044" title="The Atlas of Middle-earth">
<text>The Atlas of Middle-earth by Karen Wynn Fonstad is an atlas of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional realm of Middle-earth. It was published in 1981, following Tolkien&#x27;s major works &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. It provides many maps at different levels of detail, from whole lands to cities and individual buildings, and of major events like the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The maps are grouped by period, namely the First, Second, and Third Ages of Middle-earth, with chapters on &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. A final chapter looks at geographic themes such as climate, vegetation, population, and languages around Middle-earth.

The atlas has been warmly received by Tolkien scholars, who have called it both authorized and magisterial, providing in particular a comprehensive set of thematic maps of Middle-earth.

== Context ==

Karen Wynn Fonstad earned a master&#x27;s degree in Geography, specializing in cartography, from the University of Oklahoma, and worked as Director of Cartographic Services at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh before she focused on raising children and writing atlases of fictional worlds.

Middle-earth is the fictional world created by the philologist and fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien and presented in his bestselling books &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–1955). Tolkien provided overview maps for each book.

== Book ==

=== Publication history ===

&quot;The Atlas of Middle-earth&quot; was first published in hardback by Houghton Mifflin in the United States in 1981. A revised and updated second edition was published in 1991, after Christopher Tolkien had edited and published eight volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; following his father&#x27;s death. HarperCollins republished the revised edition in London in 1994, reprinting it in 1999, 2016, and 2017.

=== Approach ===
&quot;The Atlas of Middle-earth&quot; provides many detailed maps of the lands described in Tolkien&#x27;s books. The maps are treated as if they are of real landscapes, drawn according to the rules of a real atlas. For each area the history of the land is taken into account, as well as geography on a larger scale; from there maps are drawn. Fonstad&#x27;s discussion includes suggestions as to the geology that could explain various formations, and points that are contradictory between multiple accounts. Fonstad explains in the atlas, and in her article about it, how she came to decide on such matters. For example, she compares the western Emyn Muil with its two ridges to the Weald with its pair of inward-facing downs (an anticline).

City maps and floor plans for important buildings are included. For example, the city of Minas Tirith is mapped on a single page, the main map giving a perspective view of the whole city, while three insets show the nearly-circular plan of the city, a plan of the citadel in the innermost circle, and a labelled cutaway drawing of the White Tower at the centre of the citadel. A page of text describes the city&#x27;s geography. Further maps are given of significant events, such as the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith.

=== Content ===

The maps are organised first by period, with chapters on the First, Second, and Third Ages of Middle-earth. A chapter covers regional maps, and a short chapter focuses on &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. A major chapter follows the action in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The book ends with a chapter of thematic maps, illustrating the landforms, climate, vegetation, population, and languages of Middle-earth.

== Reception ==
The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger records that she persuaded Fonstad to write an account for &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; of how she researched and created the maps for her &quot;Atlas of Middle-earth&quot;. Fonstad, while seriously ill, accordingly prepared her last article, &quot;Writing &#x27;TO&#x27; the Map&quot; in her final months. Flieger stated &quot;We mourn her passing and we honor her work&quot;. The editor of &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, David Bratman, notes that the atlas provides historical, geological, and battle maps, with a detailed commentary and explanation of how Fonstad approached the mapping task from the available evidence. Michael Brisbois, also in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, describes the atlas as &quot;authorized&quot;, while the cartographers Ina Habermann and Nikolaus Kuhn take Fonstad&#x27;s maps as defining Middle-earth&#x27;s geography. The Tolkien scholar Luke Shelton calls the book the more popular of the two atlases of Middle-earth, the other being Barbara Strachey&#x27;s more specific &quot;Journeys of Frodo&quot;. In his view, the book isn&#x27;t perfect &quot;but it is certainly helpful&quot;, not least as it covers the First and Second Ages. 

Stentor Danielson, a Tolkien scholar, notes that Tolkien did not provide the same &quot;detailed textual history&quot; to contextualise his maps as he did for his writings. Danielson suggests that this has assisted the tendency among Tolkien&#x27;s fans to treat his maps as &quot;geographical fact&quot;. He calls Fonstad&#x27;s atlas &quot;magisterial&quot;, and comments that like Tolkien, Fonstad worked from the assumption that the maps, like the texts, &quot;are objective facts&quot; which the cartographer must fully reconcile. He gives as an instance the work that she did to make the journey of Thorin&#x27;s company in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; consistent with the map, something that Tolkien found himself unable to do. Danielson writes that in addition, Fonstad created &quot;the most comprehensive set&quot; of thematic maps of Middle-earth, presenting geographic data including political boundaries, climate, population density, and the routes of characters or armies.

<doc id="442045" wikidata="Q5631861" url="?curid=442045" title="HMS Cheshire">
<text>HMS &quot;Cheshire&quot; was a passenger ship that was built in Scotland in 1927 and scrapped in Wales in 1957. She belonged to Bibby Line, which ran passenger and cargo services between Rangoon in Burma (now Yangon in Myanmar) and various ports in Great Britain, via the Suez Canal and Gibraltar. The Admiralty requisitioned her in 1939 and had her converted into an armed merchant cruiser (AMC). She was converted into a troopship in 1943, and returned to civilian service in 1948.

She was the second of five Bibby Line ships to be named after the English county of Cheshire. The first was a steamship that was built in 1891 and sold in 1911. The third was a motor ship that was built in 1959 and sold in 1968. The fourth was built in 1971 and sold in 1983. The fifth was built in 1989.

The second &quot;Cheshire&quot; was the second of five sister ships that the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Govan in Glasgow built for Bibby Line. The first was &quot;Shropshire&quot;, which was built in 1926. They were followed by &quot;Staffordshire&quot; in 1929, &quot;Worcestershire&quot; in 1931, and &quot;Derbyshire&quot; in 1935.

==Building==
Fairfield built &quot;Cheshire&quot; as yard number 620, launched her on 20 April 1927, and completed her that July. Her registered length was , her beam was , her depth was and her draught was . Her tonnages were and . She was completed with four masts, like all Bibby ships of her era.

&quot;Cheshire&quot; had twin screws, each driven by an eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine. The combined power of her twin engines was rated at 2,196 NHP, and gave her a speed of .

As built, her navigation equipment included submarine signalling and wireless direction finding.

Bibby Line registered &quot;Cheshire&quot; at Liverpool. Her United Kingdom official number was 149601 and her code letters were 149625. By 1930 her call sign was GLXV. In 1934 this superseded her code letters.

==Auxiliary cruiser==
On 29 August 1939 the Admiralty requisitioned &quot;Cheshire&quot; for conversion into an AMC. Her primary armament was six guns, and her secondary armament was two guns. She was commissioned on 30 October, with the pennant number F18. Her first commander was Captain Montague Bernard. Her mainmast and mizzen-mast were removed, as was the top of her jigger-mast. Only her foremast survived the conversion intact.

&quot;Cheshire&quot; was assigned to the South Atlantic Station from November 1939 until April 1940, the North Atlantic Escort Force in May 1940, the Northern and Western Patrol from June 1940 until April 1941, and the Freetown Escort Force from May to November 1941. She returned to the South Atlantic Station from December 1941 to April 1943, and was assigned to the Nore Command from May to June 1943.

From January to March 1940 &quot;Cheshire&quot; took part in the escort of three SL convoys from Freetown in Sierra Leone to Britain. In June 1941 she took part in the escort of Convoy HX 131 from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Britain, and Convoy OB 335 from Liverpool out into the North Atlantic. In July 1941 she took part in the escort of Convoy BHX 137 from Bermuda to join Convoy HX 137 in mid-Atlantic to continue to Britain. In August 1942 &quot;Cheshire&quot; took part in the escort of Convoy SL 118 from Freetown to Britain.
On 8 October 1940 &quot;Cheshire&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Salopian&quot; were on patrol when enemy aircraft attacked Convoy WS 3 (Fast), which was assembling in home waters to take seven troopships from Britain to Suez. Enemy aircraft attacked the troopships and . &quot;Cheshire&quot; and &quot;Salopian&quot; came to assist. &quot;Salopian&quot; resumed her patrol, but &quot;Cheshire&quot; stayed with the destroyers and HMCS &quot;Ottawa&quot; to assist &quot;Oronsay&quot;, which had been damaged.

At 21:28 hours 14 October 1940 attacked &quot;Cheshire&quot; northwest of Ireland at position , hitting her with one torpedo. The destroyer and corvette took off 220 members of her crew. &quot;Cheshire&quot; was towed to Belfast Lough, where she was beached. She was later towed to Liverpool for repairs, which took six months. She returned to active service in 1941, commanded by Captain James Begg.

On 7 August 1942 &quot;Cheshire&quot; joined the escort of SL118, a convoy of 37 merchant ships that had left Freetown on 4 August and was bound for Liverpool. At 18:52 hours on 18 August attacked the convoy at position , firing four single torpedoes. Two hit and sank Netherland Line&#x27;s &quot;Balingkar&quot;, one damaged the British India Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s , and one damaged &quot;Cheshire&quot;.

==Troopship==
On 9 June 1943 the Admiralty returned &quot;Cheshire&quot; to Bibby Line, for conversion into a troopship for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT).

In the small hours of 24 December 1944 &quot;Cheshire&quot; and the Belgian troopship , escorted by four destroyers, left Southampton to cross the English Channel to Cherbourg. They carried the 262nd and 264th regiments, which were part of the United States Army&#x27;s 66th Infantry Division. That afternoon, just off Cherbourg, sank &quot;Léopoldville&quot; with two torpedoes, killing 763 US soldiers and 56 crew.

Between 28 and 31 December 1944 &quot;Cheshire&quot; took the US Army&#x27;s 289th Engineer Combat Battalion from Southampton to Le Havre. Other US Army units that &quot;Cheshire&quot; carried during the war included the 263rd Regiment, which was part of the 66th Infantry Division, and the 329th Regiment, which was part of the 83rd Infantry Division.

The MoWT later used &quot;Cheshire&quot; as a repatriation ship.

==Final years==
On 5 October 1948 the MoWT returned &quot;Cheshire&quot; to Bibby Line, which resumed its passenger service between Britain and Rangoon.

By 1946 &quot;Cheshire&quot;″s navigation equipment included radar. By 1955 it also included a gyrocompass.

Toward the end of her career she attended at least one of the UK&#x27;s nuclear bomb tests on Christmas Island. On 11 July 1957 she arrived in Newport, Wales, where John Cashmore Ltd scrapped her.

<doc id="442048" wikidata="Q7773179" url="?curid=442048" title="The Waffle">
<text>The Waffle (officially known as the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada after 1972) was a radical wing of Canada&#x27;s New Democratic Party (NDP) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It later transformed into an independent political party, with little electoral success before it permanently disbanded in the mid-1970s. It was generally a New Left youth movement that espoused both Canadian nationalism and solidarity with the Quebec sovereignty movement.

==Formation==
The group formed in 1969. Its leaders were university professors Mel Watkins and James Laxer. It issued a Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada and, with support in the NDP caucus and membership, worked to push the party leftward. The Waffle supported the nationalization of Canadian industries to take them out of the hands of American interests. The group was endorsed by the New Democratic Youth. The Waffle manifesto stated, &quot;A socialist society must be one in which there is democratic control of all institutions, which have a major effect on men&#x27;s lives and where there is equal opportunity for creative non-exploitative self-development. It is now time to go beyond the welfare state.&quot; According to the manifesto, &quot;The New Democratic Party must provide leadership in the struggle to extend working men&#x27;s influence into every area of industrial decision-making... By bringing men together primarily as buyers and sellers of each other, by enshrining profitability and material gain in place of humanity and spiritual growth, capitalism has always been inherently alienating. Today, sheer size combined with modern technology further exaggerates man&#x27;s sense of insignificance and impotence. A socialist transformation of society will return to man his sense of humanity, to replace his sense of being a commodity. But a socialist democracy implies man&#x27;s control of his immediate environment as well, and in any strategy for building socialism, community democracy is as vital as the struggle for electoral success.&quot;

The Waffle developed a Canadian nationalist policy. According to the founding manifesto, &quot;The major threat to Canadian survival today is American control of the Canadian economy. The major issue of our times is not national unity but national survival.&quot;

==Origins of the Waffle name==
The name was meant ironically; one story, quoted in historian Desmond Morton&#x27;s book &quot;The New Democrats&quot;, has the name originating during the drafting of the group&#x27;s manifesto when, at one point, Ed Broadbent said &quot;that if they had to choose between waffling to the left and waffling to the right, they waffle to the left.&quot; &quot;The Waffle Manifesto&quot; was the published headline of Jean Howarth&#x27;s editorial piece in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; on September 6, 1969. Howarth heard about the waffle line from Hugh Winsor, who also worked at &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and was also a co-signer of the manifesto. When Laxer and other members of the group read the headline, they adopted it.

Another possible origin for the name comes from a film-clip excerpt from a CBC documentary on the NDP, taken during a meeting of the group some months prior to the October 1969 NDP Winnipeg convention. According to the film excerpt, the Waffle term appears to have originated with Jim Laxer when he stated, &quot;in terms of the proposed manifesto, that if it doesn&#x27;t talk about nationalization of key industries, it becomes a &#x27;waffle document.&#x27;&quot; The term &quot;waffle&quot; was picked up by subsequent speakers in the discussion.

==1971 Ottawa leadership convention==

The 1971 NDP leadership convention was a battleground between the party establishment and the Waffle. About 2,000 people, out of the NDP&#x27;s approximately 90,000 membership, were members of the Waffle in 1971. The Waffle tried to get as many of their supporters onto the party&#x27;s governing bodies, but were rebuked by the large bloc of rank-and-file union voters at the convention. Carol Gudmundson — of the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Waffle — ran unsuccessfully for the party presidency. She was up against former Ontario NDP leader Donald C. MacDonald and lost to him during the April 23rd vote. University of Toronto professor Mel Watkins lost his vice-president position, but managed to get elected to the party&#x27;s federal council. The campaign for leader of the NDP pitted David Lewis against James Laxer. Through the strong support of the labour unions, Lewis succeeded in defeating Laxer on the fourth ballot on April 24. Laxer won approximately 37 percent of the final ballot vote, and established that the Waffle had some strength in the party and were no longer a small fringe group.

==The Waffle&#x27;s demise in Ontario==
During the leadership convention, the Waffle was described in the press as a &quot;party within a party.&quot; One of the last hurrahs for the Waffle came during the October 1971 Ontario provincial election. The Waffle&#x27;s Ontario chairman, Steve Penner, was Ontario NDP candidate for MPP from the Dovercourt riding. Despite the public infighting between Penner and Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis (son of national NDP leader David Lewis), Penner lost by only 55 votes. The Waffle considered this a success, because in the 1967 election, the NDP candidate lost by over 1,400 votes.

Lewis remained hostile; in 1972, he described the Waffle as &quot;an encumbrance around my neck&quot;. Then at the NDP&#x27;s Provincial Council on 24 June, Lewis obtained a resolution ordering the Waffle to disband or else leave the NDP. Debate on the motion lasted for three hours, with labour leaders leading the charge to expel the Waffle. Finally, the council approved the anti-Waffle motion 217 to 86, thereby ending months of public feuding.

==Independent party: end of the road==
Some members of the Waffle remained New Democrats; however, Laxer and Watkins accepted Lewis&#x27;s ultimatum and quit the NDP in 1972. They continued the Waffle under the name the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada, but it was still commonly referred to as the Waffle. The group existed until the Canadian federal election in 1974, when it unsuccessfully ran candidates for Parliament in the federal election. Laxer ran in the York West electoral district in Toronto, placing fourth in a field of seven with 673 votes and only 1.26 percent of the popular vote.

==Effect on NDP youth movement==
The dispute over the Waffle led to the disbanding of the Ontario NDP&#x27;s youth wing in 1972, which was not revived until 1988. The federal NDP also disbanded the New Brunswick NDP for a period in late 1971 after a local Waffle group gained control of it.

==Legacy==
Many of its leaders eventually came back into the party and held important positions within it, which also shaped many of the NDP&#x27;s policies in the 1980s through to the early 21st century.

<text>Carl Gustaf Oscar Fredrik Christian, Prince Bernadotte (10 January 1911 – 27 June 2003), originally Prince Carl, [[Duke of Östergötland]], was the youngest child and only son of Prince Carl of Sweden and Princess Ingeborg of Denmark and eventually a prince of the Belgian nobility. To distinguish himself from his father, he was widely known as &quot;Carl Junior.&quot; He was the brother of Princess Margaretha of Sweden, Queen Astrid of Belgium and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway.

==Marriage and loss of status==
When Prince Carl married Countess Elsa von Rosen (1904–1991), on 6 July 1937 at Kvillinge, Sweden, he had to relinquish his succession rights and his royal titles. She was the daughter of one Count von Rosen and ex-wife of another Count von Rosen and niece of Count Eric von Rosen and Count Clarence von Rosen. Bernadotte&#x27;s brother-in-law, King Leopold III of the Belgians, conferred upon him the title of Prince Bernadotte in the Belgian nobility on the same date, with the right to a comital title for his male-line descendants. They had one daughter, Countess Madeleine Bernadotte (Madeleine Astrid Ingeborg Ella Elsa, born in Stockholm, 8 October 1938), and were divorced in 1951. Through his daughter he was grandfather of Belgian actress Astrid Whettnall.

He married secondly Anna Margareta (Ann) Larsson (1921–1975) at Danderyd, Sweden, on 1 November 1954. They divorced in 1961 without issue. His third and final marriage took place at the Embassy of Sweden in Rabat, Morocco, on 8 June 1978, when he married Kristine Rivelsrud.

Bernadotte died at the age of 92 on 27 June 2003 in Málaga, Spain. He was the last surviving grandchild of Oscar II of Sweden. His widow, Princess Kristine Bernadotte, died at their home at Villa Capricornio in Benalmadena, Spain, on 4 November 2014 at the age of 82, without issue. His daughter Madeleine married Belgian Count Charles-Albert Ullens de Schooten-Whettnall (1927–2006) in 1962. The couple had four children and were divorced in 1980. She subsequently the same year married the Nicolaos &quot;Nicos&quot; Kogevinas with whom she has a daughter. She was widowed in 2006.

==The Huseby scandal==
Carl Bernadotte was at the centre of the Huseby scandal that occurred in the late 1950s in Sweden amidst a great deal of publicity. Bernadotte and other suspects had gained the trust of Florence Stephens, a wealthy elderly heiress of a large estate near Växjö in southern Sweden. A complex set of criminal transactions led to the ruin of Stephens and brought Bernadotte and the others to court. Bernadotte was acquitted, in spite of his full confession – it was considered that he had no criminal intent. Bernadotte left Sweden shortly after the trial and spent the rest of his life in Spain.

<text>Cherry Beach (originally Clarke Beach Park) is a lakeside beach park located at the foot of Cherry Street just south of Unwin Avenue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is on Toronto&#x27;s outer harbour just east of the Eastern Gap. It was once connected with Toronto Islands as part of the former peninsula before 1852 and later as sandbar (also referred to as Fisherman’s Island).

Despite its location at the tip of Toronto&#x27;s formerly heavily industrial Port Lands area, Cherry Beach is a popular gathering place. There is no boardwalk and much of the surrounding areas is marshland or leftover grounds from what was once commercial industry and factory grounds. Recently the park has undergone improvements which includes a paved entrance way and a renovated washroom and swimming change room facilities. It has change rooms for bathers and barbecue areas for picnickers. It also has an off-leash area for dog walkers. The Martin Goodman Trail passes through the park.

In summer, the beach water is generally calm, and slightly warmer than other Toronto beaches along the lake shore, as its shallow water is sheltered by the Leslie Street Spit from direct surges of Lake Ontario.

==History==

The area that comprises Cherry Beach today was originally a marsh and sandbar that has been land filled. It was a place of spiritual significance for many indigenous people.

In the 1850s, settlers established a community in the area. The area was called Fisherman&#x27;s Island and included a commercial fishery and church. People would travel to and from the mainland of Toronto by boat or across a breakwater that was built in 1882.

The beach park was originally named Clarke Beach Park after Harry Clarke, an alderman who was responsible for creating the park in the early 1930s. In 1974, the Toronto&#x27;s Central Waterfront Planning proposed to eliminate Cherry Beach for industrial use. In 2003, the city officially renamed it to Cherry Beach which was already the common name among locals. In 2020, a group of local residents issued a collective statement criticizing a feasibility study by Waterfront Toronto which considered providing water taxis access to the beach.

=== Ecology ===
For many years it was one of the few Toronto beaches that was clean enough for swimming, windsurfing and kitesurfing; It typically meets high water quality, environmental and safety standards; however, a 2012 environmental assessment found that the concentration of lead and zinc in the soil at Cherry Beach is above guidelines, which is attributed to previous industrial use of the area. The only other major stands of cottonwoods in the Toronto area beyond the Toronto Islands are located at Cherry Beach.

===Cherry Beach Sports Fields===
A wooded area by the beach has been turned into soccer fields, children&#x27;s play structure and a metered parking area.

In 2006 a pair of soccer fields were completed on land that had formerly been part of the greenbelt, at 275 Unwin Avenue.
The fields were surfaced in astroturf and built to FIFA standards, and games of the 2007 FIFA Jr championship were to be played there. During the environmental assessment the site was found to be heavily contaminated by heavy metals, hydrocarbons and PCBs. The soccer field was described as a &quot;transitional&quot; facility, as most of the land on either side of Unwin was underutilized city land that could be repurposed to sport facilities even though it was contaminated.

Toronto FC used the soccer pitches for practice while their own dedicated training facilities were being constructed at Downsview Park.

==In popular culture==
Pukka Orchestra had a local radio hit in 1984 with the song &quot;Cherry Beach Express.&quot; The song&#x27;s name is a euphemism for the alleged police brutality committed on gay, indigenous, and homeless people at the beach between the 1940s and 1990s. The Toronto police tried to have the song banned.

Parts of the music video for the Alessia Cara song &quot;Wild Things&quot; were filmed at Cherry Beach.

Parts of the film &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation 3D&quot; were filmed at Cherry Beach.

Toronto punk band Career Suicide named a 2008 EP after Cherry Beach.

<text>Alfred Louis Olivier Legrand Des Cloizeaux (17 October 18176 May 1897) was a French mineralogist.

Des Cloizeaux was born at Beauvais, in the department of Oise. He studied with Jean-Baptiste Biot at the Collège de France. He became professor of mineralogy at the École Normale Supérieure and afterwards at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris. He studied the geysers of Iceland, and wrote also on the classification of some of the eruptive rocks.

His main work consisted in the systematic examination of the crystals of numerous minerals, in researches on their optical properties and on the subject of light polarization. He demonstrated the circular polarization of cinnabar.

He wrote especially on the means of determining the different feldspars, and is credited with the discovery of microcline (a triclinic potash-feldspar). He named the minerals montebrasite (1871), binnite (a variety of tennantite) and Christianite (in honor of Christian VIII of Denmark). In 1854, Alexis Damour dedicated the mineral descloizite in honor of Des Cloizeaux.

Des Cloizeaux was elected as a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1869, and was its President in 1889. He was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1886. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1878. His best-known books are &quot;Leçons de cristallographie&quot; (1861) and &quot;Manuel de minéralogie&quot; (2 vols., Paris, 1862, 1874 and 1893).

<doc id="442074" wikidata="Q938013" url="?curid=442074" title="Charles Philip, Duke of Södermanland">
<text>Prince Charles Philip of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland, &quot;(&quot;; 22 April 1601 – 25 January 1622) was a Swedish prince, Duke of Södermanland, Närke and Värmland. Charles Philip was the second surviving son of King Charles IX of Sweden and his second spouse, Duchess Christina of Holstein-Gottorp.

==Biography==
He was born at Reval Castle during his parents&#x27; visit to Swedish Estonia in 1601. His father, youngest son of King Gustav I who founded Sweden&#x27;s Vasa dynasty, was Duke of Södermanland and regent of the kingdom at the time, having forced his Catholic nephew, King Sigismund, to restrict his personal rule to his other kingdom, Poland, where most of his subjects were likewise Catholic. However, in 1604, Duke Charles deposed Sigismund and donned Sweden&#x27;s crown himself, assuring the nation that his branch of the Vasas would remain Protestant.

Along with his elder brother, Crown Prince Gustav Adolph, Prince Charles Philip was educated to be a staunch Lutheran under the tutelage of Johan Skytte. He was formally made duke by his father in 1609 who, however, died in 1611. His elder brother, the new King Gustavus II Adolphus felt genuine affection for him, as it was said, for his &quot;many excellent qualities and his noble character&quot;. He was also a favourite of his mother, now queen dowager, who defended his interests against her elder son: at the coronation of 1617, she insisted his brother confirm the ducal rights in the three provinces Charles Philip held as fiefs in appanage.

In 1611, during the Time of Troubles in Russia, Jacob de la Gardie proposed Charles Philip to Novgorod and northwestern Russia as a candidate for election by the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; as the next tsar. However, when his father died shortly afterward, his mother refused to let the ten-year-old boy leave for Russia, nor did his elder brother, the new king, believe the Russians were seriously considering the proposal. In 1613, Charles Philip left for Viborg, where he was to discuss the terms of the tsardom, but after Russia appointed another tsar, Michael Romanov, he returned to Sweden.

As duke of Södermanland, the appanage held by his father before becoming king, Carl Philip was expected to eventually take up residence in its capital town, Nyköping. However, during his minority, the duchy was administered by his mother and Carl Philip remained at the royal court in Stockholm. In 1617, he visited Denmark, Germany and France. He later joined the army, and accompanied his brother in 1621 as he waged war on Livonia. He distinguished himself during the siege of Narva in 1622, but succumbed to an illness there and died. It has been shown that his brother deeply mourned him.

At the time of his death in 1622, Charles Philip was the last feudal duke in Sweden. When Gustav III re-introduced the title for a royal prince in 1772, it was a mere honorary title, carrying no provincial authority.

==Family==

On 5 May 1620 the nineteen-year-old Charles Philip married, Elizabeth Ribbing (1596–1662). Although a noblewoman (her father, Seved Svensson Ribbing, had been Sweden&#x27;s first &quot;Riksskattmästare&quot;, and her mother, Anna Gyllenstierna, belonged to one of the realm&#x27;s leading families), she was not of royal birth so the wedding ceremony was conducted in secret. This rendered futile any attempt to forcibly separate the couple, as had been done when the duke&#x27;s elder brother was compelled to abandon his great love, Ebba Brahe, whose noble birth had likewise been deemed insufficient to allow Gustavus Adolphus to marry her. It also meant that Elisabet would never share her new husband&#x27;s royal rank, the marriage being deemed &quot;morgongåvobrev&quot;.

The secret was kept until Charles Philip died soon after, fighting by his brother&#x27;s side on 25 January 1622 at Narva in Livonia. The marriage was revealed when Elizabeth gave birth to her late husband&#x27;s posthumous daughter, Elisabet, later that year (1622–1682). Queen Dowager Christina took mother and child into her household and acknowledged the marriage.

Although remaining untitled, the girl was accepted into the nobility, and eventually became mistress of the Queen Mother&#x27;s Household (&quot;Hovmästarinna&quot;) as well as her grandmother&#x27;s companion under the name &quot;Elizabeth Gyllenhielm&quot;, that surname having become traditional for children of Vasa kings and princes born outside of dynastic marriage.

Elizabeth Gyllenhielm was heiress to the castle and manor of Tynnelsö in Södermanland and lady-in-waiting of two Swedish queens consort, Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp.

She was first married at the palace in Stockholm on 13 November 1645 to the nobleman, Axel Turesson Natt och Dag (1621–47), Queen Christina&#x27;s chamberlain. Their son, Karl Axelsson Natt och Dag, died as a student at the University of Uppsala, having become Baron of Ijo (&quot;Friherre till Ijo&quot;).

Secondly, Elizabeth wed Baron Baltasar Marskalk, Master of the Royal Household.

<doc id="442079" wikidata="Q2036525" url="?curid=442079" title="Taguchi methods">
<text>Taguchi methods () are statistical methods, sometimes called robust design methods, developed by Genichi Taguchi to improve the quality of manufactured goods, and more recently also applied to engineering, biotechnology, marketing and advertising. Professional statisticians have welcomed the goals and improvements brought about by Taguchi methods, particularly by Taguchi&#x27;s development of designs for studying variation, but have criticized the inefficiency of some of Taguchi&#x27;s proposals.

Taguchi&#x27;s work includes three principal contributions to statistics:
*A specific loss function
*The philosophy of &quot;off-line quality control&quot;; and
*Innovations in the design of experiments.

==Loss functions==

===Loss functions in the statistical theory===
Traditionally, statistical methods have relied on mean-unbiased estimators of treatment effects: Under the conditions of the Gauss–Markov theorem, least squares estimators have minimum variance among all mean-unbiased linear estimators. The emphasis on comparisons of means also draws (limiting) comfort from the law of large numbers, according to which the sample means converge to the true mean. Fisher&#x27;s textbook on the design of experiments emphasized comparisons of treatment means.

However, loss functions were avoided by Ronald A. Fisher.

===Taguchi&#x27;s use of loss functions===
Taguchi knew statistical theory mainly from the followers of Ronald A. Fisher, who also avoided loss functions. 
Reacting to Fisher&#x27;s methods in the design of experiments, Taguchi interpreted Fisher&#x27;s methods as being adapted for seeking to improve the mean outcome of a . Indeed, Fisher&#x27;s work had been largely motivated by programmes to compare agricultural yields under different treatments and blocks, and such experiments were done as part of a long-term programme to improve harvests.

However, Taguchi realised that in much industrial production, there is a need to produce an outcome &quot;on target&quot;, for example, to machine a hole to a specified diameter, or to manufacture a cell to produce a given voltage. He also realised, as had Walter A. Shewhart and others before him, that excessive variation lay at the root of poor manufactured quality and that reacting to individual items inside and outside specification was counterproductive.

He therefore argued that quality engineering should start with an understanding of quality costs in various situations. In much conventional industrial engineering, the quality costs are simply represented by the number of items outside specification multiplied by the cost of rework or scrap. However, Taguchi insisted that manufacturers broaden their horizons to consider &quot;cost to society&quot;. Though the short-term costs may simply be those of non-conformance, any item manufactured away from nominal would result in some loss to the customer or the wider community through early wear-out; difficulties in interfacing with other parts, themselves probably wide of nominal; or the need to build in safety margins. These losses are externalities and are usually ignored by manufacturers, which are more interested in their private costs than social costs. Such externalities prevent markets from operating efficiently, according to analyses of public economics. Taguchi argued that such losses would inevitably find their way back to the originating corporation (in an effect similar to the tragedy of the commons), and that by working to minimise them, manufacturers would enhance brand reputation, win markets and generate profits.

Such losses are, of course, very small when an item is near to negligible. Donald J. Wheeler characterised the region within specification limits as where we &quot;deny that losses exist&quot;. As we diverge from nominal, losses grow until the point where &quot;losses are too great to deny&quot; and the specification limit is drawn. All these losses are, as W. Edwards Deming would describe them, &quot;unknown and unknowable&quot;, but Taguchi wanted to find a useful way of representing them statistically. Taguchi specified three situations:

#Larger the better (for example, agricultural yield);
#Smaller the better (for example, carbon dioxide emissions); and
#On-target, minimum-variation (for example, a mating part in an assembly).

The first two cases are represented by simple monotonic loss functions. In the third case, Taguchi adopted a squared-error loss function for several reasons:
*It is the first &quot;symmetric&quot; term in the Taylor series expansion of real analytic loss-functions.
*Total loss is measured by the variance. For uncorrelated random variables, as variance is additive the total loss is an additive measurement of cost.
*The squared-error loss function is widely used in statistics, following Gauss&#x27;s use of the squared-error loss function in justifying the method of least squares.

===Reception of Taguchi&#x27;s ideas by statisticians===
Though many of Taguchi&#x27;s concerns and conclusions are welcomed by statisticians and economists, some ideas have been especially criticized. For example, Taguchi&#x27;s recommendation that industrial experiments maximise some &quot;signal-to-noise ratio&quot; (representing the magnitude of the mean of a process compared to its variation) has been criticized.

==Off-line quality control==

===Taguchi&#x27;s rule for manufacturing===

Taguchi realized that the best opportunity to eliminate variation of the final product quality is during the design of a product and its manufacturing process. Consequently, he developed a strategy for quality engineering that can be used in both contexts. The process has three stages:

*System design 
*Parameter (measure) design
*Tolerance design

====System design====

This is design at the conceptual level, involving creativity and innovation.

====Parameter design====

Once the concept is established, the nominal values of the various dimensions and design parameters need to be set, the detail design phase of conventional engineering. Taguchi&#x27;s radical insight was that the exact choice of values required is under-specified by the performance requirements of the system. In many circumstances, this allows the parameters to be chosen so as to minimize the effects on performance arising from variation in manufacture, environment and cumulative damage. This is sometimes called robustification.

Robust parameter designs consider controllable and uncontrollable noise variables; they seek to exploit relationships and optimize settings that minimize the effects of the noise variables.

====Tolerance design====

With a successfully completed &quot;parameter design&quot;, and an understanding of the effect that the various parameters have on performance, resources can be focused on reducing and controlling variation in the critical few dimensions.

==Design of experiments==

Taguchi developed his experimental theories independently. Taguchi read works following R. A. Fisher only in 1954.

===Outer arrays===

Taguchi&#x27;s designs aimed to allow greater understanding of variation than did many of the traditional designs from the analysis of variance (following Fisher). Taguchi contended that conventional sampling is inadequate here as there is no way of obtaining a random sample of future conditions. In Fisher&#x27;s design of experiments and analysis of variance, experiments aim to reduce the influence of nuisance factors to allow comparisons of the mean treatment-effects. Variation becomes even more central in Taguchi&#x27;s thinking.

Taguchi proposed extending each experiment with an &quot;outer array&quot; (possibly an orthogonal array); the &quot;outer array&quot; should simulate the random environment in which the product would function. This is an example of judgmental sampling. Many quality specialists have been using &quot;outer arrays&quot;.

Later innovations in outer arrays resulted in &quot;compounded noise.&quot; This involves combining a few noise factors to create two levels in the outer array: First, noise factors that drive output lower, and second, noise factors that drive output higher. &quot;Compounded noise&quot; simulates the extremes of noise variation but uses fewer experimental runs than would previous Taguchi designs.

===Management of interactions===

====Interactions, as treated by Taguchi====
Many of the orthogonal arrays that Taguchi has advocated are saturated arrays, allowing no scope for estimation of interactions. This is a continuing topic of controversy. However, this is only true for &quot;control factors&quot; or factors in the &quot;inner array&quot;. By combining an inner array of control factors with an outer array of &quot;noise factors&quot;, Taguchi&#x27;s approach provides &quot;full information&quot; on control-by-noise interactions, it is claimed. Taguchi argues that such interactions have the greatest importance in achieving a design that is robust to noise factor variation. The Taguchi approach provides more complete interaction information than typical fractional factorial designs, its adherents claim.

*Followers of Taguchi argue that the designs offer rapid results and that interactions can be eliminated by proper choice of quality characteristics. That notwithstanding, a &quot;confirmation experiment&quot; offers protection against any residual interactions. If the quality characteristic represents the energy transformation of the system, then the &quot;likelihood&quot; of control factor-by-control factor interactions is greatly reduced, since &quot;energy&quot; is &quot;additive&quot;.

====Inefficiencies of Taguchi&#x27;s designs====
* Interactions are part of the real world. In Taguchi&#x27;s arrays, interactions are confounded and difficult to resolve.

Statisticians in response surface methodology (RSM) advocate the &quot;sequential assembly&quot; of designs: In the RSM approach, a screening design is followed by a &quot;follow-up design&quot; that resolves only the confounded interactions judged worth resolution. A second follow-up design may be added (time and resources allowing) to explore possible high-order univariate effects of the remaining variables, as high-order univariate effects are less likely in variables already eliminated for having no linear effect. With the economy of screening designs and the flexibility of follow-up designs, sequential designs have great statistical efficiency. The sequential designs of response surface methodology require far fewer experimental runs than would a sequence of Taguchi&#x27;s designs.

==Assessment==
Genichi Taguchi has made valuable contributions to statistics and engineering. His emphasis on &quot;loss to society&quot;, techniques for investigating variation in experiments, and his overall strategy of system, parameter and tolerance design have been influential in improving manufactured quality worldwide.

<doc id="442087" wikidata="Q554560" url="?curid=442087" title="René Angélil">
<text>René Angélil (; – ) was a Canadian musical producer, talent manager and singer. He was the husband and manager of singer Celine Dion.

==Early life==
Angélil was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to a father of Syrian descent and a mother of Lebanese origin. His father, Joseph Angélil, was born in Montreal to parents from Damascus, Syria, and his mother, Alice Sara, was born in Montreal to Lebanese parents. He was the older of two children; he had a brother, André (born 1945). Both of his parents were members of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. Angélil studied at Collège Saint-Viateur (high school), in Outremont and at Collège André-Grasset (post secondary), in Montreal.

==Career==
Angélil started out in 1961 as a pop singer in Montreal. He formed a pop rock group, , with childhood friends Pierre Labelle and Jean Beaulne. Les Baronets had some hits during the 1960s, mostly translations of English-language pop hits from the United Kingdom or the United States, such as &#x27;C&#x27;est fou, mais c&#x27;est tout&#x27; in 1964 (a translation of The Beatles&#x27; song Hold Me Tight). After the dissolution of the group in 1972, Angélil and best friend Guy Cloutier began managing artists.

Together they managed the career of two successful Québec entertainers René Simard and Ginette Reno, among many other pop stars at the time. They parted ways in 1981 to each become solo managers. In 1981 (not long after being terminated as Ginette&#x27;s manager and considering leaving the music business to pursue law school), René heard Celine Dion&#x27;s demo tape when he was considered as a potential producer for her album. He soon took over as her agent. He continued as her manager until June 2014, when he stepped down because he had cancer.

Angélil became one of several co-owners of Montreal&#x27;s iconic Schwartz&#x27;s Deli in 2012.

He has also had occasional acting roles in film and television, notably a supporting role in &quot;Sex in the Snow (Après-ski)&quot; and a leading role in &quot;The Apparition (L&#x27;Apparition)&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1966, Angélil married his first wife, Denyse Duquette. Their son Patrick was born in 1968, and they divorced in 1972. He married singer Anne Renée in 1974; they had two children, Jean-Pierre (born 1974) and Anne-Marie Angélil (born 1977), then divorced in 1986. Anne-Marie married singer Marc Dupré in 2000.

Angélil, a well-known former singer-turned-manager, was sent a tape of then 12-year-old singer Celine Dion and invited her to audition in Quebec. He began managing her career, taking the teen and her mother on tour in Canada, Japan, and Europe. He mortgaged his house to finance her first album in 1981.

Angélil and Dion began a personal relationship in 1988 when she was twenty years old. Their first date took place the night Celine won the Eurovision Song Contest on 30 April 1988. Her mother was vehemently opposed to the union due to their 26-year age gap and his previous failed marriages. However, she eventually relented as most of the family was supportive. The couple married on 17 December 1994. The lavish wedding ceremony at Montreal&#x27;s Notre-Dame Basilica was broadcast live on Canadian television.

After Angélil was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1999, and before beginning radiation treatment, the couple turned to in-vitro fertilisation. Their efforts were extensively publicised. Their son René-Charles Angélil was born on 25 January 2001. Dion suffered a miscarriage in 2009, then gave birth to twin boys on 23 October 2010. The boys were named Eddy after Eddy Marnay, who produced Dion&#x27;s first five albums, and Nelson Angélil after former South African president Nelson Mandela.

Angélil and Dion were huge fans of the Montreal Canadiens NHL hockey team, and were good friends of former Quebec Nordiques / Colorado Avalanche president and general manager Pierre Lacroix.

Montreal Jubilation Choir founder Trevor Payne has said that &quot;backstage, out of the eye of the general public, they were the kindest, most down-to-earth superstars that I&#x27;ve ever known in my entire career.&quot;

===Defamation suit===
In 2001, Angélil and Dion filed a $5million defamation lawsuit against the Quebec tabloid &quot;Allô Vedettes&quot;, which claimed that the couple paid $5,001 to rent the swimming pool of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas so that Dion could sunbathe topless and Angélil could go skinny dipping. The couple strenuously denied the claim.

==Gambling==
Angélil was an avid poker player, having qualified for the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, and finishing in the money at the 2007 Mirage Poker Showdown event on the World Poker Tour, a series of high-stakes tournaments. Angélil was also rumoured to be a dedicated gambler away from the poker table. He reportedly gambled upwards of $1million a week at Caesars Palace, and kept a line of credit for the same amount at Bellagio. In 2007, Jan Jones, a casino executive and the former mayor of Las Vegas, claimed that Angélil gambled $1million a week, but later retracted the statement. Caesars Palace later released a statement of Angélil&#x27;s gambling losses and wins with his permission.

==Later life, illness and death==
Angélil suffered a heart attack in 1991 at age 49. In 1999, he was diagnosed with throat cancer, and made a full recovery after treatment. He appeared in the video for Simple Plan&#x27;s song &quot;Save You&quot; as a survivor of cancer. In 2009, Angélil reportedly underwent a planned, heart-related medical procedure to deal with arterial blockage.

Angélil had surgery in December 2013 for throat cancer. In June 2014, Angélil stepped down as Dion&#x27;s manager to focus on his health, but was still involved in business decisions related to her career. In September 2015, Dion announced that Angélil&#x27;s cancer had progressed and that he had only &quot;months to live&quot;. Angélil died on 14 January 2016, of throat cancer, two days before his 74th birthday. He received a &quot;national funeral&quot; service at Notre-Dame Basilica from the government of Quebec on 22 January, and was buried at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery.

Following Angélil&#x27;s death, Dion became the sole owner and president of her management and production companies, including CDA Productions and Les Productions Feeling.

<doc id="442088" wikidata="Q3802" url="?curid=442088" title="Hanau">
<text>Hanau () is a city in the Main-Kinzig-Kreis, in Hesse, Germany. It is 25 km east of Frankfurt am Main and part of the Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region. Its railway station is a major junction and it has a port on the river Main, making it an important transport centre. The city is known for being the birthplace of Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm and Franciscus Sylvius. Since the 16th century it was a centre of precious metal working, with many goldsmiths. It is home to Heraeus, one of Germany&#x27;s largest family-owned companies.

Once the seat of the Counts of Hanau, Hanau lost much of its architectural heritage in World War II, such as its City Palace. A British air raid in 1945 created a firestorm, killing a sixth of the remaining population and destroying 98% of the old city and 80% of the city overall. The outer parts of the city have old timbered towns like and castles like .

In 1963, Hanau hosted the third &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival. Until 2005, Hanau was the administrative centre of the Main-Kinzig-Kreis. On 19 February 2020, a gunman attacked two bars and a kiosk in Hanau, murdering nine people with roots outside Germany, before shooting his mother and himself.

== Geography ==
The historic core of Hanau is within a semicircle of the river Kinzig that flows into the river Main just west of the city. Today, after a substantial expansion during the 19th and 20th centuries, it also extends to the river Main. After a restructuring of municipal borders within Hesse in the 1970s, a couple of nearby villages and towns were incorporated. After that change, Hanau for the first time also extended to the south bank of the Main.

=== Climate ===
On the 0 °C isotherm, Hanau has a humid continental climate as Eastern Germany with warm summer, classified by Köppen as &quot;Dfb&quot;. In the -3 °C isotherm has oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with some interior characteristics. Hanau is the westernmost city on the European continent below 200 m at sea level in this category.

==Name==

&#x27;Hanau&#x27; derives from &quot;Hagenowe&quot;, a combination of (&#x27;wood&#x27;) and (&#x27;open land by the side of a river&#x27;).

==History==

=== Old town ===
Hanau was first mentioned as a settlement in 1143. It was the site of a castle that used the river Kinzig as a defense. The castle belonged to a noble family that began calling themselves &quot;of Hanau&quot; in the 13th century. A village developed around the castle and it became a town in 1303. As a result of this history, Hanau&#x27;s main church stood outside its walls in the village of Kinzdorf. The villagers moved into Hanau and Kinzdorf became an abandoned village, leaving only the church. In the 15th century the status of the Hanau parish church was transferred to the church of Mary Magdalene within the town walls.

Shortly after the first town walls were built at the beginning of the 14th century, the town outgrew this limit. Outside the wall, along the road to Frankfurt am Main, a settlement developed (the &quot;Vorstadt&quot;) that was properly included in the fortifications of Hanau only when Hanau received completely new Renaissance-style fortifications during the first half of the 16th century. These fortifications enclosed three elements: the medieval castle, the town of Hanau, and the &quot;Vorstadt&quot;.

=== New town ===
====Huguenots====
In 1597 Count Philipp Ludwig II attracted French Protestant (Huguenots) refugees, who had been admitted to Frankfurt but had only very limited accommodation, to found their own settlement south of Hanau. This happened under the direction of the guardian of the Hanau count, Johann VI von Nassau-Dillenburg, who hoped for significant economic and cultural advances from the settlement of the &#x27;Réfugiés&#x27; from south-west France. In return for the assurance of free exercise of their religion, the refugees undertook to become economically active in Hanau. Out of this tradition, goldsmiths are still trained in Hanau. Hanau also was the site of the first workshop to produce faïence (tin-glazed pottery) within Germany. These new citizens were granted privileges and formed their own community, church and administration for the &quot;new town of Hanau&quot; (&quot;Neustadt Hanau&quot;) wholly separate from the existing community. A stark contrast to the Catholic Church, but also to the Lutheran Church of the time, was the participation of laypeople in church-governing functions, as well as the design of the church, especially the decalogues (boards displaying the Ten Commandments). Each congregation was led by a &quot;Consistoire&quot;, elected by congregation members for life, which is roughly comparable to today&#x27;s church council. The descendants of the French Reformed religious refugees have assimilated in Hanau over time.

====Walloon-Dutch refugees and Jews====
In contrast to the Huguenots, Walloon and Dutch Calvinist refugees came from an area of what is now the Netherlands, Belgium, and the French Département Nord at the time of Spanish rule, the Spanish Netherlands. With the arrival of the Huguenots, Walloons and Dutch, Hanau&#x27;s rise to an important business location began. Until 1821, the new town had its own independent community, independent of the old town. The Reformed Walloon-Dutch community still exists today.

Philipp Ludwig II also allowed Jews to settle in Hanau. From 1604 there was a Jewish community again.

It took more than 200 years to amalgamate both. The new town, larger than the old one, was protected by a then very modern fortification in Baroque style, which proved a big asset only a few years later in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The town survived a siege in 1637 with only minor damage.

The new citizens formed the major economic and political power within the County of Hanau and in 1642 played a leading role in the succession of Count Fredrik Casimir of Hanau Lichtenberg into the County of Hanau-Münzenberg, of which Hanau was the capital.

=== 17th century ===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War Hanau was taken by the Swedes in 1631. In 1636 it was besieged by imperial troops but was relieved on the 13 June by William V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, on account of which the inhabitants commemorate that day.

=== 18th century ===

Johann Reinhard III of Hanau-Lichtenberg, the last of the Counts of Hanau, died in 1736. Those parts of his county belonging to the County of Hanau-Münzenberg, which included Hanau, were inherited by the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Due to dynastic troubles within his family, the County of Hesse-Hanau was created a separate state from the Landgraviate until 1786. So Hanau remained the capital for another 50 years. Even after that it became the second-most important town in Hesse-Kassel, after Kassel.

=== 19th century ===
During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon I ordered the fortifications of Hanau destroyed. This created a chance for both parts of the town to expand across their former limits. In 1813, the Battle of Hanau took place near the city between French troops and Austro-Bavarian forces; the former won. During the 1820s the administrations of both towns of Hanau merged. The first common mayor, who became lord mayor (Oberbürgermeister), was . He became prime minister and minister of the interior of the Electorate of Hesse after the Revolution of 1848.

With its preindustrial workshops, Hanau became a nucleus of a heavy industrialisation during the 19th century from within the city (e.g., Heraeus) as well as from outside (e.g., Degussa and Dunlop). This was heavily supported by its development as an important railway interchange of six railway lines, most of them main lines:
* 1848: Frankfurt-Hanau Railway
* 1854: Main–Spessart Railway
* 1867: Frankfurt–Bebra Railway, eastern direction
* 1873: Frankfurt–Bebra Railway, western direction
* 1879/1881: Friedberg–Hanau Railway
* 1882: Odenwald Railway

====Revolution of 1848====

1848 Hanau was a centre of the German democratic movement and contributed significantly both in 1830 and in the Revolution of 1848. As part of this movement the German Gymnastic League (&quot;Deutscher Turnerbund&quot;) was founded here in 1848. Like all of Hesse-Kassel, Hanau was annexed to Prussia in 1866 after its prince-elector took the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War. It remained part of Prussia until 1945.

In the late 19th century Hanau became a major garrison town. Due to its interchange of railway lines a large detachment of military railway-engineers as well as other military units were stationed here.

As a free-trade city, Hanau developed a silver manufacturing industry using fantasy hallmarks. Hanau silver was produced from the mid-19th to the early 20th century.

=== 20th century ===

During World War II, Hanau&#x27;s Jewish population was persecuted. The last Jews were deported in May 1942.

Hanau&#x27;s inner city was mostly destroyed by British airstrikes in March 1945, a few days before it was taken by the U.S. Army. Around 87% of the town was destroyed. Of the city&#x27;s 15,000 inhabitants at the time, 2,500 died in the attack.

Hanau housed one of the largest garrisons of the U.S. Army in Europe. It was an important strategic location in the so-called Fulda Gap. The military community had a population of 45,000 military members, U.S. civilians and family members at its peak during the Cold War. The extensive U.S. facilities included Hanau Army Airfield, also known as &quot;Fliegerhorst Langendiebach&quot;. The garrison closed in 2018. Most of the former military areas have been converted to civil use.

===21st century===
In 2010, Hanau started a huge building project to completely redesign the inner city. These are the town&#x27;s largest construction projects since the reconstruction after World War II.

On 19 February 2020, eleven people—including the perpetrator—were killed in a spree shooting at two shisha bars and a flat in the town. The perpetrator, known as Tobias Rathjen, opened fire at Midnight Bar and Arena Bar in Hanau centre and Kesselstadt. He then drove home, where he killed his mother and himself.

In September 2021, Hanau reached 100,000 inhabitants. Starting 1 January 2026, Hanau will regain its &quot;kreisfreie Stadt&quot; (district-free city) status. It will secede from Main-Kinzig-Kreis after losing the privilege in 1974 after the Hessian district reformation. 

==Economy==
At present, many inhabitants work for the technological group Heraeus, or commute to Frankfurt. Frankfurt International Airport is 30 km away.

Nuclear energy company Nukem was headquartered in Hanau, with a nuclear fuel plant in its Wolfgang district, until 1988.

==Population==
* With 101,364 residents, Hanau is the sixth-most populous town in Hesse. Having lost its status as administrative centre of the Main-Kinzig-Kreis (Main-Kinzig district) to Gelnhausen in 2005, proposals have been made that Hanau should form its own administrative district by 1 January 2026.
* More than 20% of the inhabitants are foreign nationals, mostly Turks.

== Jewish community ==
The earliest documentary evidence of Jews in Hanau is from 1313. In the 17th and 18th centuries Hanau developed into an important center of Hebrew printing. The community numbered 540 in 1805, 80 families in 1830, 447 persons in 1871, and 657 at the turn of the century. In 1925 there were 568 Jews in Hanau.

<text>Europe Day is a day celebrating &quot;peace and unity in Europe&quot; celebrated on 5 May by the Council of Europe and on 9 May by the European Union.

The first recognition of Europe Day was by the Council of Europe, introduced in 1964. The European Union later started to celebrate its own European Day in commemoration of the 1950 Schuman Declaration which first proposed the European Coal and Steel Community, leading it to be referred to by some as &quot;Schuman Day&quot; or &quot;Day of the united Europe&quot;. Both days are celebrated by displaying the flag of Europe.

==History==

The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949, and hence it chose that day for its celebrations when it established the holiday in 1964.

The &quot;Europe Day&quot; of the EU was introduced in 1985 by the European Communities (the predecessor organisation of the EU). The date commemorates the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950, put forward by Robert Schuman, which proposed the pooling of French, Italian and West German coal and steel industries. This led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, the first European Community, established on 18 April 1951.

A &quot;raft of cultural icons&quot; was launched by the European Commission in 1985, in reaction to the report by the ad hoc commission &quot;for a People&#x27;s Europe&quot; chaired by Pietro Adonnino. The aim was to facilitate European integration by fostering a Pan-European identity among the populations of the EC member states. The European Council adopted &quot;Europe Day&quot; along with the flag of Europe and other items on 29 June 1985, in Milan.
Following the foundation of the European Union in 1993, observance of Europe Day by national and regional authorities increased significantly. Germany in particular has gone beyond celebrating just the day, since 1995 extending the observance to an entire &quot;Europe Week&quot; (&#x27;) centered on 9 May. In Poland, the , a Polish organisation advocating European integration established in 1991, first organised its Warsaw &#x27; on Europe Day 1999, at the time advocating the accession of Poland to the EU.

Observance of 9 May as &quot;Europe Day&quot; was reported &quot;across Europe&quot; as of 2008. In 2019, 9 May became an official public holiday in Luxembourg each year, to mark Europe Day. The EU&#x27;s choice of the date of foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community rather than that of the EU itself established a narrative in which Schuman&#x27;s speech, concerned with inducing economic growth and cementing peace between France and Germany, is presented as anticipating a &quot;vocation of the European Union to be the main institutional framework&quot; for the much further-reaching European integration of later decades.

The European Constitution would have legally enshrined all the European symbols in the EU treaties; however, the treaty failed to be ratified in 2005, and usage would continue only in the present &quot;de facto&quot; manner. The Constitution&#x27;s replacement, the Treaty of Lisbon, contains a declaration by sixteen members supporting the symbols. The European Parliament &quot;formally recognised&quot; Europe Day in October 2008.

== Celebrations and commemorations ==

=== Open Doors Day ===
The EU institutions open their doors to the public every year in Brussels and Strasbourg, allowing citizens to visit these places. Moreover, many of these organize commemorative events to honor the historical importance of the date.

The bodies that choose to make this symbolic gesture are:

* European Parliament (EP)
* Council of the European Union 
* European Commission (EC) 
* European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)
* The European Committee of the Regions (CoR)

In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent inability to host physical events, the EU institutions organized virtual acts to pay tribute to all those Europeans who were collaborating in the fight against the pandemic. Furthermore, 2020 marked the 70th anniversary of the Schuman declaration and the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Given the occasion, the above-mentioned EU institutions launched several online events to commemorate the importance of the date.

==Legal recognition==
Europe Day is a public holiday for employees of European Union institutions. In 2019, it was declared a public holiday in Luxembourg, and is also a public holiday in Kosovo. It is a &quot;memorial day&quot; in Croatia, which is a legally-recognised day, but is not a public holiday; a legally-recognised commemorative day in Lithuania; and a &quot;flag day&quot; () in Germany, where flags are ordered to be shown by federal decree. Europe Day is also celebrated in Romania, where it coincides with the State Independence Day of Romania (Romania&#x27;s independence day).

Between 2003 and 2023, Europe Day was celebrated in Ukraine on the third Saturday of May. On 8 May 2023, the President of Ukraine established a decree to celebrate Europe Day on May 9, coinciding with EU member states.

<doc id="442101" wikidata="Q548373" url="?curid=442101" title="Edward C. Tolman">
<text>Edward Chace Tolman (April 14, 1886 – November 19, 1959) was an American psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Through Tolman&#x27;s theories and works, he founded what is now a branch of psychology known as purposive behaviorism. Tolman also promoted the concept known as latent learning first coined by Blodgett (1929). A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Tolman as the 45th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

Tolman was one of the leading figures in protecting academic freedom during the McCarthy era in early 1950s. In recognition of Tolman&#x27;s contributions to both the development of psychology and academic freedom, the Education and Psychology building on Berkeley campus, the &quot;Tolman Hall&quot;, was named after him.

==Early life==
Born in West Newton, Massachusetts, brother of Caltech physicist Richard Chace Tolman, Edward C. Tolman studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving B.S. in electrochemistry in 1911. Tolman&#x27;s father was a president of a manufacturing company and his mother was adamant of her Quaker background. Tolman attended MIT because of family pressures, but after reading William James&#x27; &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot; he decided to abandon physics, chemistry, and mathematics in order to study philosophy and psychology. James&#x27; influence on Tolman could be seen in Tolman&#x27;s courageous attitude and his willingness to cope with issues that cause controversy and are against the popular views of the time. Tolman always said he was strongly influenced by the Gestalt psychologists, especially Kurt Lewin and Kurt Koffka.

In 1912, Tolman went to Giessen in Germany to study for his PhD examination. While there he was introduced to and later returned to study Gestalt psychology. Later, Tolman transferred to Harvard University for graduate studies and worked in the laboratory of Hugo Munsterburg. He received his PhD from Harvard University in 1915.

== Career ==
Tolman is best known for his studies of learning in rats using mazes, and he published many experimental articles, of which his paper with Ritchie and Kalish in 1946 was probably the most influential. His major theoretical contributions came in his 1932 book, &quot;Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men&quot;, and in a series of papers in the &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, &quot;&quot;The determinants of behavior at a choice point&quot; (1938), &quot;Cognitive maps in rats and men&quot; (1948), and &quot;Principles of performance&quot; (1955).

=== Purposive behaviorism ===
Some of Tolman&#x27;s early researches were early developments of what is now called behavioral genetics. Tolman would selectively breed rats for the ability to learn the mazes he constructed. Despite the fact that his major research focus involved instinct and purpose, he was open to the idea of researching innate abilities in the rats. Tolman&#x27;s study was the first experiment to examine the genetic basis of maze learning by breeding distinct lineages of rats selected for their maze performance. Tolman started and continued this research project until 1932, where, after coming back from Europe on a sabbatical leave, his interest started to decrease. Tolman&#x27;s theoretical model was described in his paper &quot;The Determiners of Behavior at a Choice Point&quot;&quot; (1938). The three different variables that influence behavior are: independent, intervening, and dependent variables. The experimenter can manipulate the independent variables; these independent variables (e.g., stimuli provided) in turn influence the intervening variables (e.g., motor skill, appetite). Independent variables are also factors of the subject that the experimenter specifically chooses for. The dependent variables (e.g., speed, number of errors) allows the psychologist to measure the strength of the intervening variables.

Although Tolman was firmly behaviorist in his methodology, he was not a radical behaviorist like B. F. Skinner. In his studies of learning in rats, Tolman sought to demonstrate that animals could learn facts about the world that they could subsequently use in a flexible manner, rather than simply learning automatic responses that were triggered off by environmental stimuli. In the language of the time, Tolman was an &quot;S-S&quot; (stimulus-stimulus), non-reinforcement theorist: he drew on Gestalt psychology to argue that animals could learn the connections between stimuli and did not need any explicit biologically significant event to make learning occur. This is known as latent learning. The rival theory, the much more mechanistic &quot;S-R&quot; (stimulus-response) reinforcement-driven view, was taken up by Clark L. Hull.

A key paper by Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish in 1946 demonstrated that rats learned the layout of a maze, which they explored freely without reinforcement. After some trials, a food item was placed to a certain point of the maze, and the rats learned to navigate to that point very quickly. However, Hull and his followers were able to produce alternative explanations of Tolman&#x27;s findings, and the debate between S-S and S-R learning theories became increasingly complicated. Skinner&#x27;s iconoclastic paper of 1950, entitled &quot;Are theories of learning necessary?&quot;, persuaded many psychologists interested in animal learning that it was more productive to focus on the behavior itself rather than using it to make hypotheses about mental states. The influence of Tolman&#x27;s ideas faded temporarily in the later 1950s and 1960s. However, his achievements had been considerable. His 1938 and 1955 papers, produced to answer Hull&#x27;s charge that he left the rat &quot;buried in thought&quot; in the maze, unable to respond, anticipated and prepared the ground for much later work in cognitive psychology, as psychologists began to discover and apply decision theory – a stream of work that was recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize to Daniel Kahneman in 2002. In his 1948 paper &quot;Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men&quot;, Tolman introduced the concept of a cognitive map, which has found extensive application in almost every field of psychology, frequently among scientists who are unaware that they are using the early ideas that were formulated to explain the behavior of rats in mazes. Tolman assessed both response learning and place learning. Response learning is when the rat knows that the response of going a certain way in the maze will always lead to food; place learning is when the rats learn to associate the food in a specific spot each time. In his trials he observed that all of the rats in the place-learning maze learned to run the correct path within eight trials and that none of the response-learning rats learned that quickly, and some did not even learn it at all after seventy-two trials.

Furthermore, psychologists began to renew the study of animal cognition in the last quarter of the 20th century. This renewed interested in animal research was prompted by experiments in cognitive psychology.

=== Other psychological work ===
Aside from the contributions Tolman made to learning theory such as purposive behaviorism and latent learning, he also wrote an article on his view of ways of learning and wrote some works involving psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Tolman was very concerned that psychology should be applied to try to solve human problems, and in addition to his technical publications, he wrote a book called &quot;Drives Toward War&quot;. Moreover, in one of his papers, &quot;&quot;A theoretical Analysis of the Relations between Psychology and Sociology&quot;, Tolman takes independent, dependent, and intervening variables under the context of psychology and sociology. Then he puts them together and show the interrelations between the two subjects in terms of variables and research. In another publication, &quot;Physiology, Psychology, and Sociology&quot;&quot;, Tolman takes the three subjects and explains how all three depend or interrelate with each other and must be looked at as a whole. Tolman creates a hypothetical situation and shows the conditions and interrelations between the three subjects in the situation.

Tolman developed a two-level theory of instinct in response to the debate, at the time, of the relevance of instinct to psychology. Instinct was broken down into two parts: determining or driving adjustments and subordinate acts. Adjustments are motivations or purposes behind subordinate acts, while the subordinate acts fulfill that purpose. Adjustments are the response to a stimulus and can be arranged in a hierarchy with the lowest adjustment producing subordinate acts. Subordinate acts are randomized independent actions, excluding reflexes, that are part of larger groups of activity. While considered infinitely numerous, the amount found in a grouping is limited with identifiable boundaries. The cycle begins with a stimulus that produces a determining adjustment or a hierarchy of adjustments. The lowest adjustment then cues subordinate acts that persist until the purpose of the adjustment is fulfilled.

Humans are unique in that we can think out our actions ahead of time. Tolman called this thoughts-of-acts or thinking-of-acts. This prevents us from acting completely random until something finally works. Thinking-of-acts triggers an inhibitory process that prevents the determining adjustment from cuing subordinate acts. Following the thinking, a prepotent stimulus turns those thoughts into acts. There are two ways a stimulus would be considered prepotent: (a) the original adjustment is favorable to the act produced by the foresee stimulus, or (b) the stimulus creates an alternative adjustment more favorable than the original.

An example of this theory in action could be being trapped in a burning building. Without thinking, the lowest determining adjustment would be to escape, producing various acts where you may run around randomly trying to stumble upon an escape route. Or, you could stop and think, inhibiting that first process. You remember that the door in the corner leads to a hallway, to a stairwell, to a set of doors to the street. This would be an example of thinking-of-acts. The street would be the prepotent stimulus because it produces a favorable act to the original stimulus. Alternately, you could think that it might be dangerous to use the stairwell as smoke tends to pool in them and instead run to a window to call for help. This would be another version of a prepotent stimulus because it produces an alternative adjustment that is more favorable than the original. This might be because you learned that it may be safer to stay near a window and call for help than to go further into the burning building, creating a self-preservation adjustment.

In 1948 Tolman wrote an article regarding the life of Kurt Lewin after Lewin&#x27;s death in 1947. It contained some of Lewin&#x27;s background, his contributions, and honest criticisms of his research. Overall Tolman wrote about him in a very positive light. Tolman regarded him along with Sigmund Freud as psychologists who would be well recognized in the future.

=== Northwestern and Berkeley ===
Edward Tolman started his academic career in Northwestern University, where he was an instructor from 1915 to 1918. Most of Tolman career, however, was spent at the University of California, Berkeley (from 1918 to 1954), where he was a professor of psychology.

He was one of the senior professors whom the University of California sought to dismiss in the McCarthy era of the early 1950s, because he refused to sign a loyalty oath — not because of any lack of felt loyalty to the United States but because it infringed on academic freedom. Tolman was a leader of the resistance to the oath, and when the Regents of the University of California sought to fire him, he sued. Tolman made an address to the Special Convocation at McGill University on June 11, 1954. In his address he advocated and made argument for the need of academic freedom, as well as criticized scapegoating. The resulting court case, Tolman v. Underhill, led in 1955 to the California Supreme Court overturning the oath and forcing the reinstatement of all those who had refused to sign it.

In 1963, at the insistence of the then President of the University of California, Clark Kerr, the Berkeley campus&#x27; newly constructed Education and Psychology building was named &quot;Tolman Hall&quot; in honor of the late professor. Tolman&#x27;s portrait hung in the entrance hall of the building. Tolman Hall was demolished in 2019 due to seismic unsafety.

==Awards and honors==
Tolman received many awards and honors. He was president of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1937 and chairman of Lewin&#x27;s Society for the Psychological Study of Social issues in 1940; he was a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. APA gave him an award in 1957 for distinguished contributions. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949.

==Personal life==
Tolman was married to Kathleen Drew Tolman. They had three children, Deborah, Mary, and Edward James. Noted singer-songwriter, music producer Russ Tolman, is Tolman&#x27;s grandson.

As mentioned previously, Tolman&#x27;s father wished for his son to eventually take over the manufacturing company. Tolman was more interested in pursuing psychology than pursuing his father&#x27;s career. Fortunately his family was very supportive of this decision.

<doc id="442102" wikidata="Q124661" url="?curid=442102" title="Strathclyde">
<text>Strathclyde ( in Northern Brittonic; in Gaelic, meaning &#x27;strath [valley] of the River Clyde&#x27;) was one of nine former local government regions of Scotland created in 1975 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and abolished in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. The Strathclyde region had 19 districts. The region was named after the early medieval Kingdom of Strathclyde centred on Govan, but covered a broader geographic area than its namesake.

==History==
The Strathclyde region was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Strathclyde covered the whole area of six counties and parts of another two, which were all abolished for local government purposes at the same time:
*Argyll (except Ardnamurchan District and the electoral divisions of Ballachulish and Kinlochleven)
*Ayrshire
*Buteshire
*Dunbartonshire
*Glasgow
*Lanarkshire
*Renfrewshire
*Stirlingshire (part, being the burgh of Kilsyth, Western No. 3 District, the electoral division of Kilsyth West, and the polling district of Kilsyth East (Banton))

The region was named after the ancient British or Brythonic Damnonii Kingdom of Strathclyde. The kingdom had broadly covered the southern part of the local government region created in 1975, thus with the Argyll and Buteshire parts not having been within the ancient kingdom. Conversely, the kingdom had included areas further to the south, which were never part of the post-1975 Strathclyde (Dumfries and Galloway, as well as Cumbria in England).
Strathclyde Regional Council was responsible for education, social work, police, fire, sewage, strategic planning, roads, and transport. It employed almost 100,000 public servants, almost half of whom were teachers, lecturers and others in the education service.

Strathclyde region was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. The region was divided into twelve council areas: Argyll and Bute, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow City (created as &quot;City of Glasgow&quot;), Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire (created as &quot;Dumbarton and Clydebank&quot;)

==Geography==
The Strathclyde region was on the west coast of Scotland and stretched from the Highlands in the north to the Southern Uplands in the south. It included some of the Inner Hebrides in the north-west but also contained Scotland&#x27;s largest urban area of Glasgow. As a local government region, its population, in excess of 2.5 million, was by far the largest of the regions and contained half of the population of Scotland.

==Political control==
Politics in the region were dominated by the Labour Party. The first regional council convener was the Reverend Geoff Shaw, who died in 1978. It was largely due to his leadership that the regional council forged its innovative strategy on multiple deprivation, which remained its central commitment to the end of the region&#x27;s life through &quot;Social Strategy for the Eighties&quot; (1982) and &quot;SS for the 90s&quot;.

The first election to Strathclyde Regional Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence Labour held a majority of the seats:

===Leadership===
The council had two main leadership roles: a convener who acted as ceremonial head and presided at council meetings, and a leader of the council to provide political leadership.

Conveners
Leaders
===Elections===
Elections were held every four years.


===District result maps===
==Premises==
The council initially rented offices called Melrose House at 19 Cadogan Street in Glasgow to act as an interim headquarters pending a decision being taken on a permanent headquarters. Various other offices around the centre of Glasgow were also used for additional office space, notably on India Street (the Glasgow City Chambers was not used by the regional administration and was instead the headquarters for the Glasgow district). In 1976, the nearby former Glasgow High School buildings at 94 Elmbank Street were vacated. The council converted the former school buildings to become its headquarters, using the school&#x27;s dining room block of 1897 to become a council chamber, whilst using the India Street offices as additional accommodation. The remodelled school and neighbouring offices were formally opened by Elizabeth II on 2 November 1979, when the whole complex of eleven buildings was collectively renamed &quot;Strathclyde House&quot;.

After the council&#x27;s abolition several of the modern office buildings which made up Strathclyde House were gradually sold off for redevelopment. The old High School buildings, which are category A listed buildings, were used by Glasgow City Council as additional office space. The council chamber there was briefly used in 2000 by the Scottish Parliament, whilst its new permanent home at Holyrood was under construction and the temporary buildings in Edinburgh were booked out. Glasgow City Council sold the old High School buildings in 2010 but a new use has yet to be found for them.

== Emergency services ==
Until April 2013, the area was also used as a police force area, covered by Strathclyde Police, and a fire service area, covered by Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service. Both have now been replaced by single services (Police Scotland and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service).

== Transport ==
The name is still in use as a transport area, covered by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport. The area covered by SPT however is smaller than the region, as most of Argyll and Bute lies outside its remit.

== Sub-regions and districts ==
Except for Argyll and Bute and the City of Glasgow, the 19 districts were grouped to form &#x27;sub-regions&#x27; or &#x27;divisions&#x27;, each named after a historic county. The Argyll and Bute district and the City of Glasgow district were sub-regions in their own right, and Argyll and Bute was named after two counties.

<text>Kota Baru, Thailand (, , Malay: كوتا بارو) is a sub-district (tambon) in Raman District, Yala Province, southern Thailand.

== History ==
In 2465 B.E. the Siamese Government established a Malayan provincial administration divided into seven districts and dependent on Pattani county. The county is divided into Pattani, Nong Chik, Yaring, Sai Buri, Yala, Ra-ngae and Kota Baru or Raman, which depend on Yala. Tuan Kalupae was the first sheriff of Kota Baru. His title was &quot;Luang-aat-ta-sit-ti -som-boon&quot;.

Kota Baru abounded with natural resources, including elephants, forests, gold and rubies. An army protected a territory extending to Perlis, Malaysia. Many governors were respected by Buddhists, Muslims and Chinese from both local and foreign areas, which are called &quot;Tohnijawea&quot; or &quot;Tohni&quot;.

Kota Baru Governor Phraya Ratanapakdee (Tuan malaleayawor) was wealthy and respected by the people. He donated land to build Ban Kota Baru school (&quot;Rattanapadung wittaya&quot;). Rattanapakdee was loved by the people. People who were homeless could live in the palace in exchange for working or farming. Kota Baru&#x27;s palace was a shelter for people traveling or doing business in Yala. In the kitchen, two large cookers supplied rice for guests.

Kota Baru&#x27;s governor enjoyed sport, especially a martial art called &quot;Si-la&quot;. The governor trained the young men in the palace as dancers and sent a teacher from Kota Baru to Kelantan state. On an important day, a si-la dance is held. At night time &quot;Di-ke&quot; &quot;hulu&quot; show is offered. &quot;Di-ke hulu&quot; was created in Kota Baru. Kota Baru was named &quot;Kota Ramai&quot; which means a city of joy relating to important events or welcoming guests from afar.

Descendants of the governor, use the title &quot;Tuan&quot; in front of their name. Most are domiciled in Kota Baru, Raman District, Yala.

Kota Baru was a district of Yala Province until 2469 B.E. After that the name changed back to &quot;Raman&quot;.

==Administration==
===Central administration===
The &quot;tambon&quot; is divided into four villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local administration===
The subdistrict is covered by the subdistrict municipality (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) Kota Baru (เทศบาลตำบลโกตาบารู).

<doc id="442110" wikidata="Q2273582" url="?curid=442110" title="Mark Bowden">
<text>Mark Bowden (; born 1951) is an American journalist and writer. He is a former national correspondent and longtime contributor to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Bowden is best known for his book &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot; (1999) about the 1993 U.S. military raid in Mogadishu, which was later adapted into a motion picture of the same name that received two Academy Awards.

Bowden is also known for the books &quot;Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World&#x27;s Greatest Outlaw&quot; (2001), about the efforts to take down Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, and &quot;Hue 1968&quot;, an account of the Battle of Huế.

==Early life==
Bowden was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1951. He graduated from Loyola University Maryland in 1973 with a B.A in English literature. While he was at college, he was inspired to embark on a career in journalism by reading Tom Wolfe&#x27;s book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;.

==Career==
From 1979 to 2003, Bowden was a staff writer for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. In that role he researched and wrote &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and &quot;Killing Pablo&quot;, both of which appeared as lengthy serials in the newspaper before being published as books. He published two books prior to these, &quot;Doctor Dealer&quot; and &quot;Bringing the Heat&quot;, both of which were based on reporting he originally did for the newspaper. He has since published twelve other books. Bowden wrote the 1997 &quot;Playboy&quot; profile of Donald Trump.

Bowden is a contributing writer for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and has contributed to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Air Mail&quot;, &quot;Business Insider,&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

He has taught journalism and creative writing at Loyola University Maryland, and was Distinguished Writer in Residence at the University of Delaware from 2013 to 2017.

Former Florida State Seminoles football coach Bobby Bowden is his first cousin once removed.

==Criticism==
From June 2012 through March 2013, the legal blog &quot;Trials &amp; Tribulations&quot; (&quot;T&amp;T&quot;), which reports on California trials and legal affairs, ran a seven-part series titled &quot;Fact Checking Mark Bowden&#x27;s Curious Vanity Fair Article on Stephanie Lazarus&quot;. This series disputes elements of Bowden&#x27;s July 2012 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, &quot;A Case So Cold It Was Blue&quot;. The author suggests that Bowden may have created quotes and states of mind of principals to fit his story, and questions whether the journalist had conducted relevant interviews or attended a single day of the murder trial of former LAPD detective Stephanie Lazarus, although this case was the centerpiece of his story.

Part VI of the series, published on &quot;T&amp;T&quot; in October 2012, noted that Cullen Murphy, Bowden&#x27;s editor at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, declined to comment on the record to the blog&#x27;s author about the allegations related to Bowden&#x27;s article. Part VII, published in March 2013, said that Bowden, who was not approached about the blog&#x27;s allegations prior to their posting, had since declined to respond to questions posed by the website&#x27;s blogger regarding his article. He has said that he welcomes questions about it from others.

Poynter Journalism School blog posted an extended analysis of the dispute by Craig Silverman, noting that &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; had posted a correction to the article, and that &quot;the discrepancies [noted by &quot;T&amp;T&quot;] don&#x27;t amount to quote manipulation or a misrepresentation of what was said.&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; editor Cullen Murphy, in an e-mail to Poynter, said in part &quot;the quotations used in Bowden&#x27;s text correspond with relevant portions of the video. Some things are hard to make out, and there may be an occasional small variance, but a fair reading would conclude that the quotes track accurately and correctly capture the dynamic of the interrogation. There has been no distortion.&quot; Silverman closes by listing three takeaways for newsrooms, one of which is, &quot;Whether or not you like the tone or approach taken by an outside critic, you still have a responsibility to examine claims of factual error or ethical malfeasance,&quot; and he notes further that it might have been easier for &quot;T&amp;T&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to deal with the issue if they had spoken to one another directly.

== Personal views ==

=== On coercive interrogation and torture ===
In the October 2003 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Bowden&#x27;s article &quot;The Dark Art of Interrogation&quot; advocated an official ban on all forms of &quot;coercive&quot; interrogation but argued that they should still be practiced in secret and should not necessarily be punished if revealed. Written more than a year before the violations of prisoners were revealed at Abu Ghraib and other detention centers, he wrote, in part:
The Bush Administration has adopted exactly the right posture on the matter. Candor and consistency are not always public virtues. Torture is a crime against humanity, but coercion is an issue that is rightly handled with a wink, or even a touch of hypocrisy; it should be banned but also quietly practiced. Those who protest coercive methods will exaggerate their horrors, which is good: it generates a useful climate of fear. It is wise of the President to reiterate U.S. support for international agreements banning torture, and it is wise for American interrogators to employ whatever coercive methods work. It is also smart not to discuss the matter with anyone.&lt;br&gt;

If interrogators step over the line from coercion to outright torture, they should be held personally responsible. But no interrogator is ever going to be prosecuted for keeping Khalid Sheikh Mohammed awake, cold, alone, and uncomfortable. Nor should he be.

In &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; by Jon Ronson, Bowden&#x27;s article was noted as a reference to the CIA&#x27;s Project ARTICHOKE. This program developed physical methods that can be used during interrogations and Ronson noted that they can be brutal or fatal.

=== Future of the media ===
Bowden believes that young people are just as drawn to &quot;deep&quot; journalism as other generations of people have been. He said in March 2009: &quot;Nothing will ever replace language as the medium of thought, so nothing will replace the well-written, originally-reported story, or the well-reasoned essay.&quot;

<text>The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS ) is a global association supporting the female-oriented and female-only Guiding and Scouting organizations in 153 countries. It was established in the year 1928 in Parád, Hungary. The organization now has its headquarters located in London, United Kingdom. It is the counterpart of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). WAGGGS is organized into five regions and operates five international Guiding centers. It holds full member status in the European Youth Forum (YFJ), which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union.

==Mission==

The mission of WAGGGS is &quot;to enable girls and young women to reach their potential as responsible citizens of the world.&quot;

WAGGGS offers a non-formal educational program focused on developing life skills, leadership, and decision-making. It conducts international projects and programs aimed at preparing Girl Guides and Girl Scouts for responsible citizenship through community involvement.

Members are encouraged to participate in leadership roles. Each unit operates democratically, with individuals elected to positions and group members contributing to key decisions.

The organization relies on approximately 100,000 volunteers to lead and support its programs worldwide. It serves around 10 million Scouts and Guides across 152 countries, with international events hosted at five world centers.

Members can attend international events organized by the United Nations and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on behalf of WAGGGS. Both WAGGGS and the World Organization of the Scout Movement hold General Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

==Educational methods==
Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting is based on a core set of values that are found in the Girl Guide/Girl Scout Promise and Law. Each Girl Guide and Girl Scout is asked to promise to do her best to her faith and to others, with the intention that in so doing she is able to realize her fullest potential as a responsible citizen.

Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting uses non-formal educational methods, focusing on organized educational activity outside schools and colleges. The key components of the WAGGGS&#x27; non-formal education are that:
*Young people can develop life skills and attitudes based on an integrated value system based on the Promise and Law.
*Young people learn from their peer group.
*Young people learn through activities and practical programs that are created by young people for young people.
*Young people volunteer to join non-formal education organizations that are led also by volunteers that ensure commitment and maximum learning.
*Young people learn by progressive self-development through:
**Learning by doing,
**Teamwork though the patrol system and training for responsible leadership, and
**Active cooperation between young people and adults.

Each Guide/Girl Scout defines her own progress and development according to her needs and aspirations within the framework program provided. This contrasts with many formal education systems where young people must fit themselves into a rigid structure with little recognition of individual needs and differences. The Girl Guide/Girl Scout method is the specific way that the leadership works with girls and young women to achieve the mission of WAGGGS. It is an integrated approach with certain key elements: the Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting method can be used equally effectively with girls of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. In his book &quot;Girl Guiding&quot;, Lord Baden-Powell (1918) wrote:

Since the organization&#x27;s inception, many Girl Guides and Girl Scouts have achieved positions as leading politicians, writers, businesswomen, and leaders. Senator Hillary Clinton (United States Senate), the Rt. Hon Dr. Marjorie Mowlam MP (politician in the United Kingdom), Roberta Bondar Ph.D., MD (first Canadian woman astronaut), and Betty Okwir (politician in Uganda) are a few former and current Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.

In 1965, Dame Leslie Whateley of the then &quot;Girl Guides World Bureau&quot; was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.

Amongst its global initiatives, &quot;Free Being Me&quot;, a collaboration between WAGGGS and Unilever&#x27;s Dove Self Esteem Project, was launched in October 2013 with the aim of increasing &quot;self-esteem and body confidence&quot; in girls.

==History==
Girl Guides were formed in 1910 by Robert Baden-Powell with the assistance of his sister Agnes Baden-Powell. After his marriage in 1912, his wife Olave Baden-Powell took a leading role in the development of Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting.

As the movement spread, independent national Guiding associations were set up; however, a need for international cooperation was felt. Lady Baden-Powell founded an informal International Council in London in February 1918, which later became the International Conference in 1919. At the fourth World Conference held at Camp Edith Macy in 1926, representatives from several countries suggested the formation of a World Association to take the place of the informal International Council. After the 1926 International Conference, the Baden-Powells were approached about setting up a formal association and in 1928 the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts was founded at the 5th International Conference held in Parád, Hungary. It was at that conference that International Conference became the World Conference. Rose Kerr was Vice Chairman, later Commissioner for Tenderfoot Countries. From 1930 to 1939 WAGGGS occupied a room at the headquarters of the British Girl Guide Association, until it moved to 9 Palace Street, next door to Our Ark.

In 1920, two leaders from each known Guide country were invited to the British County Commissioners Conference held at Saint Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. This became known as the First International Conference. The 13th World Conference was held in the same college in 1950. The member organizations continue to meet every three years (initially every two years) at World Conferences.

==World Conference==

The World Conference is the governing body and meets every three years. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation.

==Organization==
WAGGGS consists of national Member Organizations which are run independently but agree to abide by the WAGGGS constitution. The national Member Organizations are split into five regions. The member organizations in turn elect the World Board, originally the World Committee, which governs the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. It is made up of 17 active volunteer members from around the world who are democratically elected by all Member Organizations and include the Chairs from each of the five WAGGGS regions. In addition, there is the permanent staff of the World Bureau based in London and headed by the WAGGGS Chief Executive (formerly Director of the World Bureau). Every three years representatives from the member states meet in a World Conference to discuss and vote on policy. The World Committee changed its name to the World Board in 1996. The job title of the head of staff was changed from Director of the World Bureau to Chief Executive between 1964 and 1997.

Each WAGGGS Member Organization chooses how it believes it can best promote these goals, taking into account its culture and the needs of its young people. Some choose to work with girls alone in a single-sex environment in order to break down stereotypes and to give girls and young women the confidence to take their place in society. Other Member Organizations prefer to work with mixed groups to enable young women and young men equal partnership within their units. Some Organizations choose to mix co-educational and single-sex approaches according to the age and the preferences of the young people.

===World regions===

The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has five regions: Europe, Arab, Africa, Asia and Western Hemisphere.

===World Centres===
WAGGGS operates five World Centers that offer training programmes, activities, and lodging for girls and leaders, as well as members of some other groups and independent travellers. Activities are primarily focused on international friendship and cooperation, personal development, and leadership training, enjoyment and service. The Friends of the Four World Centers organization supports and promotes the centers.

The five World Centers are:
* Our Chalet, in Adelboden, Switzerland; opened in 1932.
* Pax Lodge, in Hampstead, London, England; current location opened in 1990. It is actually London&#x27;s third World Centre; the first was Our Ark, opened in 1937, which was renamed Olave House on its 25th anniversary.
* Our Cabaña, in Cuernavaca, Mexico; opened in 1957.
* Sangam, in Pune, Maharashtra, India; opened in 1966.
* Kusafiri, moving between cities, Africa; opened in 2010.
A new centre, Kusafiri, meaning &quot;to journey&quot; in Swahili, was announced in 2015. Unlike the other centers, it will be a roving centre and exist for a fixed period of time in different places with a particular theme in Africa. While testing the idea, starting in 2012, the country organizations involved include Ghana, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Benin. Focuses so far have included &quot;Stopping the Violence&quot; training in Rwanda and developing entrepreneurial leaders among others.

==World Trefoil==

Miss Kari Aas designed the World Trefoil emblem that was adopted at the World Conference in 1930, a gold trefoil on a blue background.

The three leaves represent the three duties and the three parts of the promise, the two five point-stars stand for the promise and the law and the vein in the centre represents the compass needle showing the right way. The base of the trefoil stands for the flame of the love of humanity and the colours blue and gold represent the sun shining over all children in the world.

The &quot;World Badge&quot;, incorporating the trefoil, was first adopted at the 11th World Conference in Evian, France in 1946.

The &quot;World Association Badge&quot;, similar in design to the World Badge, was first adopted at the 7th World Conference in Bucze, near Górki Wielkie in Poland, in 1932. It is worn by members of the World Board, its Committees, World Bureau and World Centre staff.
